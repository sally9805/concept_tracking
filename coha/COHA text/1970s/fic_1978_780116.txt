 | Reverend Roanoke entered the six-story First National Bank Building at two-fifty on Wednesday afternoon . The Clarkson Coal Company 's executive offices occupied the three top floors . He exchanged greetings with Sylvester , the elevator operator , and went up to the fourth floor . Through the frosted-glass door Reverend Roanoke went into the bustling outer office , where about twenty men and a sprinkling of women were filing , typewriting , or studying pieces of paper . This Negro in his black suit and hat and clerical collar created a certain suspension of activity upon entering . The typewriting slackened , stopped . The woman at the first desk , whom he approached hat in hand , said that Mr. Catherwood was expecting him . Then she added , after some hesitation , would he care to sit down in one of the chairs opposite her desk ? Reverend Roanoke did so , placing his hat on his knee , and began looking genially about him . The typewriters stutteringly resumed . After about ten minutes the lady told him to cross this outer room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Reverend Roanoke entered a rather large square room . It was dominated by big dark wooden furniture ; there were shelves of thick books , brown and white framed photographs of coal tipples and groups of men . Two long windows on each of the two outer walls gave a sweeping view of Middleburg ? town , bridges , railroad , river . It seemed that the man who presided in this office was in a position to dominate all of them . To be sure , one block up the street , out of sight of these windows , rose the Clifton Building , two stories taller than the First National Bank Building , and from there the Clifton brothers could dominate everything visible including this building as well . Clarkson , in stiff collar and tie and gray suit , relaxed in  | his swivel chair behind the heavy desk , his back to the view . " Hello there , how are you ? Have a seat , " he said in an energetic voice . Reverend Roanoke said , " How do you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair on the other side of the desk , once again placing his hat on his knee . " Well , " resumed Clarkson , rubbing his hands together , " let me come right to the point . " " Good . " Clarkson glanced quickly at his face , slightly thrown off stride by Roanoke 's rejoinder . Then he went on , " My wife has taken an interest in your ? what you do down in Bennettown , very interested she is , and knowing as I do something about how religion works , churches I mean , the way churches work , operate , I felt as the member of the family who takes care of the accounts I ought to make a ? some kind of a contribution to your ? church . " " That would be most kind of you , indeed , Mr. Catherwood . " " And I ? " " May I just add , sir , in accepting with all gratitude whatever you see fit to donate to carrying on this work , that Mrs. Catherwood is a truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her is enrichment indeed . Now , if in addition , you , acting for her , make a material contribution as well , then I am truly rewarded . " There was a silence while Clarkson , jaw set , contemplated him . Then he said , " Mrs. Catherwood has always felt drawn to all kinds of religions . We 're Episcopalians , but my wife went to a Catholic convent school because her family thought they got better training there . More discipline . She 's active in our church here , Christ Church . And now your ? church . It is , that 's the other matter , the building you use in Bennettown , that building happens to be on land belonging to the Clarkson Coal Company . "  | " Is that so ! " Reverend Roanoke looked surprised but not perturbed . " Yes . Somebody put up that barn there years ago and nobody bothered about it at the time . Now , however , I have some plans for that piece of land . More miners ' houses . Expansion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennettown . So we 'll have to repossess the barn you 've been conducting your services in . Tear it down . " " I see . " There was another silence and then Clarkson said , " You are , I understand , a kind of traveling minister , is n't that so ? Preaching for a while in one place and then moving on to another . " " That is so , yes . I had thought , " he went on in a quiet tone , " that perhaps in Bennettown I had found a place in which I might , you might say , rest . That 's what I was beginning to think . But I see , I see now , that that is not to be . " Clarkson was writing out a check . " Perhaps , " Reverend Roanoke went on , " it is God 's will . Perhaps it is . " In any case it was clear that this was Clarkson Gatherwood 's will , and Clarkson Catherwood and four other men were as close to godliness in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reverend Roanoke 's past experiences had made clear to him that such powerful forces could not be resisted . If they opposed him , as they sometimes had in the past , then he had to carry his work on elsewhere . He always stayed in the mountains , however , for there he felt at home , and he never crossed the Mason-Dixon Line into the North , although he had heard that colored people were treated better there . He could only work among people he knew in his bones . And now the good people he had gathered wound him in Bennettown would have to go on without him , and he without them . Oh , if he could only fight once in a while , resist , defy . But  | he had concluded that this was not God 's way , not God 's wish for him . It was not the way of a minister of God . And it was not the way of a colored man in the South , not yet it was n't . Clarkson handed him the check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roanoke left . Two days later Tot responded to the bell ringing at the front door of the Castle at five o'clock in the afternoon . There stood Reverend Roanoke in his dignified clerical black . " Greetings , Sister Antoinette . I 've come for a farewell visit , to you , to Brother George , and to Sister Minnie . " Tot 's face fell into a muddle of feelings , confusions she had never envisaged dealing with : religious supremacy versus white supremacy , the Word of God versus the Power of Caesar . To whom to render what ? Here , at one and the same time , was the Messenger of Eternal Salvation deigning to pay a visit , and a colored man coming to the front door ! " Why Reverend ! Why , wo n't you ... should I ... we .. . Miss M ? " " Thank you , Sister , " he said , stepping into the house , entering the two-story octagonal front hall with its stained glass , its suit of armor , its inner gallery on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie from above . " It 's Reverend Roanoke , Miss Minnie ! " " Oh , " her voice floated down , " how wonderful ! I 'm just finishing with Lylie , and I 'll be right down ! " Reverend Roanoke seated himself in one of the heraldic chairs next to the suit of armor . He motioned to Tot to sit down on the carved walnut chest next to him . Uncertainly , cautiously , she moved over and perched lightly on it , as though prepared at any moment to take flight . They began talking of things of the spirit . After a few minutes Minnie came sailing down the curving stairway from the gallery above . Her hair was escaping from the bun in back , she was in a gray smock and house slippers , she was concealed by no veils or feathers or jewelry , a good-looking  | woman in her thirties at the end of a somewhat hectic , hard , and worrying day . Her face shone as she came up to Reverend Roanoke and he clasped her two hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? library , she started to say , a warm room for real human exchange , but then the image of Clarkson loomed up in her mind , it was his sanctum really ? " sitting room , come on , Tot . Where 's George ? Let 's have some tea , " and she led Reverend Roanoke into the still little front parlor . This is the wrong room , she thought to herself . There is no right room , no room for salvation , in this house . Minnie seated herself on a long , hard , horsehair sofa , and he sat down next to her . " Sister Minnie , I 'm going away , " he said in his warm , resonant voice , looking into her eyes . " Yes , I know , " she said unhappily . " You understand , do n't you ? " " I ? I do n't know if I do . " She gazed a little piteously at him . " I know that Clarkson . . . called on you , he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you were leaving . I knew that . . . I found out that he owns the land where your church is . " " The church too ! " exclaimed Reverend Roanoke goodnaturedly . " But in the end , it is all the Lord 's , it is all the Lord 's , in the end . Mr. Catherwood is the steward for a while of this valuable land , with all its riches underneath . I am not leaving because someone is the steward of the land and of the humble little barn we use . We can meet anywhere . See ? We meet here , in your Castle ! We meet in Bennettown , in Sister Youranie 's little house . Anywhere . We need no church . I leave because I can tell others , see into their souls and so illuminate them , that 's all I do , the light is there , the small ? but eternal ? light of goodness , I turn the little knob and ? flash ! ? all the light spreads through them , they glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them see , feel ! Was n't it so with you ? " " Oh yes , yes ! It just flooded through me , my ? my salvation saved me ! " " There , that 's the way it is . And this I must now do for others , other luminous souls in our glorious Appalachian hills and valleys and mountaintops , the colored and the white people alike . " " Yes ! " " And Sister Minnie , one thing I never told you . In the end , at the Last Judgment , when we all rise and face our Maker , there are no whites or blacks or reds or browns , we are all gold , golden radiance . That 's our true color within , that is the golden glow of our salvation , and before our Maker on the Last Day it stands revealed , the same color for one and for all , glorious gold , shining through . " " Oh yes . " There was a light rap on the door , and then Tot and George came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and served , trying hard to make this farewell as pleasant and happy as possible , but trembling inside , lest the departure of Reverend Roanoke would take away , suddenly or gradually , her newfound sense of salvation , of worth , of , yes , competence , and she might lapse again into that drifting aimless spirit she had been , combing her hair , drinking herself with her special tonic into an unreal world of cushioning but uneasy dreams . They all sat sipping their tea , speaking of God and the Last Judgment and Tennessee and Bennettown and then there were footfalls in the hall outside . Clarkson opened the door and looked in . " Hello , dear , " said Minnie . Tot and George sprang to their feet . Reverend Roanoke also rose . Clarkson surveyed the scene , a formidable figure in his vested navy blue suit with high stiff collar , watch chain ,  | all the symbols of business power , even his florid complexion . Clarkson at first looked surprised at this tea-party-inprogress , but he was used to masking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , teatime , " he said agreeably . " Fix me a cup , will you , Aunt Tot ? " He crossed the room and sat down on a stiff little chair . " Dear , " Minnie began , " Reverend Roanoke has come to say good-bye . He 's leaving . " " Is he ? " said Clarkson with interest . " Tennessee is waiting , " said Reverend Roanoke forthrightly . " Oh how we shall miss you , " murmured Minnie , " and the church . " " There is no more need for me here ? well , let us say , not as much as there is down there in Tennessee , where I have never yet brought my message . " There was a silence , and then Minnie said , " Clarkson , how much money did you give Reverend Roanoke ? " Both men began to make demurring sounds ? in this tense little moment Tot and George disappeared from the room ? but Minnie persisted . " Two hundred dollars ? Five hundred ? How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was a very generous ? " began Reverend Roanoke . " Five hundred dollars , " said Clarkson . Minnie sighed lightly , indicating that she found the sum at least adequate . She sensed , although she would not say it , that this sum had served both as a contribution and a bribe , and that Clarkson had wanted Reverend Roanoke gone . She sensed why too : he did not wish for her to continue in the new independence and competence which she had found . Well . Reverend Roanoke was leaving , so Clarkson would have his wish there , although Minnie felt certain that the Reverend had been on the point of leaving anyhow , what with Tennessee waiting and all . i56J  | But she was going to continue in her new way of life , and Clarkson she hoped would eventually come to like it , see how much better it was . But whether he did or not , she was going to continue .  | LIFE had entered a new phase in Catherwood Castle . Clarkson remained its lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time took her place as its mistress . She found ways to be helpful in Bennettown and some of the other mining camps , her opium tonic and her drifting days forgotten . Clarkson still did not like it . To himself he explained the change as Min 's getting older ; he found her somewhat less attractive than before . Maybe I 'm getting older too , he conceded to himself . But in any case he was far too busy to brood much about his domestic life . The big years of coal ? 1909 to 1914 ? were succeeded by the fantastic boom years of 1915 , 1916 , 1917 , and 1918 ? years of enormous growth and profits , those leading to and through the Great War . The Great War , in addition to bringing a vast increase in demand for coal , had one other momentous effect in the coalfields . Like a quiescent volcano it had remained for the most part  | beneath the surface until now : the earthshaking latent anger of mine labor . There had been strikes and fights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 these had subsided , for the men and their leaders had recognized that there was a war coming and then a war in progress , and so the hundreds of thousands of miners toiled on in what many or most of them considered miserable conditions for drastically unfair wages while there was this war going on , and while the Cliftons and the Hayeses and the Catherwoods were , as any fool could see , rolling in prodigious new waves of wealth . The coalfields , then , were quiescent and hugely productive during the war years . Then came Armistice Day , November 11 , 1918 , and then came Strike Day , April 1 , 1919 , when 453,000 bituminous miners went out on strike for higher wages , and remained on strike , ranks unbroken , for six weeks , until forced to return to work by a federal court order . To the coal operators , the massiveness of the walkout and the discipline of the miners were ominous warnings of the men 's anger , and the power of their unity . Middleburg was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner that night in 1910 that there was some danger , some force threatening the family , had not dimmed through the huge prosperity of the war . It had increased . And she knew in her heart that her fresh-milk funds and new playgrounds could do nothing to fend off what she felt was approaching . Terrible strikes ? Physical violence ? Bolshevik revolution ? She could not have said . She was not an analytical woman ; she did not read a great deal . But she sensed that this apprehension of hers was grounded in real danger , and that the danger to herself , to Clarkson and their child was growing . Ten years of ever higher profits had gone by , and she felt even more urgently that they were living  | beneath some menace equivalent to the chief menace the men lived with in the mines , that for the Catherwoods too some kind of cave-in threatened . Then in April of 1919 there had been this vast and militant and disciplined strike of every organized coal miner in the country , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were court orders , she wondered . How powerful would they be in the next strike ? Should n't the miners have been treated better earlier ? Should n't they be now , when it was perhaps still not too late ? That first great miners ' strike had ended in the middle of May 1919 , leaving a smoky discontent , like a mine fire beneath the surface . And then , one year later almost to the day , it burst again with guns pounding and blood spurting into the light of day . Around Middleburg most of the miners had quietly and peaceably joined the United Mine Workers during the war . The operators there did not like it , but it had kept the industrial peace and the mines working . In the southern part of the state , however , where some of them , including Clarkson Catherwood , also had interests , they joined with the southern operators in flatly and totally resisting the union . It was un-American , anti  --  free enterprise , tied their hands , usurped their rights , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bludgeoning weapon into their hands in fighting unionization . This court decision ruled that a miner living in a house he rented from the company employing him was not like other citizens with the usual Anglo-Saxon rights of occupancy ; he was instead a servant  | of the operator , living on the operator 's premises , at the operator 's pleasure . The miner , his family , and his possessions could be thrown out into the street anytime the operator so desired , and every southern operator desired and enforced this eviction whenever a miner tried to join , or advocated joining , the union . To work for what they considered low wages in dangerous conditions was bad enough ; to be denied a union was worse ; to be evicted from house and home , with every stick of furniture into the street , aroused an atavistic rage throughout the southern fields which was not to be calmed by any possible court decision . This was life and death , and both sides knew it . These evictions were carried out by the sheriff of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? known to the miners as " tin horns " ? of the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency . The miners had mortal grievances against both these groups of enforcers : the deputy sheriffs were very often paid employees of the coal companies , openly and unashamedly so although this was illegal in West Virginia , and the Baldwin-Felts detectives were a collection of exconvicts , hoodlums , and other bruisers who carried out orders in a rough , ready , and ruthless fashion . One spring day in 1920 , twelve Baldwin-Felts detectives arrived in the small town of Matewan , Mingo County , in the extreme southwestern end of the state , to evict some miners and their families for pro-union activities . In a sultry , tinderbox atmosphere , they were walking along the main street from the railroad station when they were intercepted by Sid Hatfield , the chief of police . The force consisted of himself and one other man , Ed Chambers . Sid Hatfield was described by an acquaintance as " six feet tall in height , about one hundred sixty-five pounds , had strong shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile that would not come off . " The mayor of the town , also a young man , was C. C.  | Testerman . These three town officials and the twelve detectives , all fifteen of them very much armed , confronted each other on Matewan 's main street , a typical sleepy southern block of two-story brick and wooden buildings , telephone poles , a few parked cars . Hatfield ordered the detectives out of town , and told them they could not carry out the evictions . One of the two detective leaders answered that Chief of Police Hatfield was obstructing the execution of the law and that he , the private detective , was going to arrest him . Who was the law in West Virginia at this time was a hazy question , depending not always on who wore the badge but on what power controlled the county . The mayor said that no such arrest could take place . And then the shooting started . The first victim to fall was Mayor Testerman , mortally wounded . Next , a gun in each hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two detective leaders . Then gunfire burst out all around the dusty street , and in the end seven detectives , the mayor , and two striking miners lay dead . One detective escaped by hiding in a large wastebasket and then swimming the Tug River into Kentucky . After that , according to witnesses , a drunken orgy seized Matewan , with the bodies of the dead detectives being robbed and mutilated . Later some union supporters made a movie of their defender , Smilin ' Sid , and exhibited it at union meetings . Others , however , made Hatfield a villain of Iago-like complexity . For while Sid and Ed Chambers maintained that the action which set off the killings , the shooting of Mayor Testerman , had been done by one of the detectives , the surviving detectives claimed that Hatfield had himself shot the mayor in order to achieve a strictly private end : to marry pretty Jessie Testerman , the mayor 's wife . And in fact , whoever shot the mayor , Sid Hatfield did marry Jessie Testerman soon afterward . Smilin ' Sid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief witness against him was a kin of his , Anderson Hatfield . One night when Anderson Hatfield was snoozing on the front porch of his hotel in Matewan a bullet whizzed out of somewhere and killed him . Smilin ' Sid , brought to trial soon after , was acquitted by a jury described as " terrified . " Within the confines of Mingo County , Sid Hatfield was safe . Neighboring McDowell County , however , was a stronghold of the mine owners and their hired men , the BaldwinFelts detectives . Soon after his acquittal in Mingo County , Sid was indicted in McDowell County for shooting up a mining camp there . This was widely believed to be a trumped-up charge . The " Matewan Massacre " had occurred on May 19 , 1920 . On August 1 , 1921 , Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers , who had also been indicted in McDowell County for the mining camp shoot-up , inexplicably actually appeared at the county seat , the town of Welch , to answer the charge . Sid had at least taken the precaution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in McDowell County from Governor Morgan of West Virginia and from County Sheriff Hatfield , the Hatfields being a very widespread family in that part of the state . Accompanied by their wives , they arrived by train in Welch , and went to the hotel , with their lawyer , to get a room . None being available , they used the lawyer 's room to prepare for the court appearance . This preparation , according to the testimony of both wives , including divesting themselves of their firearms . The four of them then proceeded down the street to the courthouse , an imposing , ivy-covered building . As they began to mount the steps to the entrance they saw that ten BaldwinFelts detectives were lounging about . What happened next , just as at Matewan , was disputed afterward by witnesses . What is certain is that a great many  | bullets began to fly , and at the end of it all the detectives were unhurt , so were the wives , and Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers lay dead , drilled full of holes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be holding guns . Two dicta of the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency appear to have been fulfilled : " Kill ' em with one gun , hand ' em another " and " Nobody ever killed a Baldwin-Felts man and lived long to brag about it . " W. C. Mitchell , chief of police in Welch , said he saw Chambers shoot at a detective , and later he took a " warm gun with six empty chambers " out of the corpse 's hand , and another gun from Hatfield 's body . Whether anyone believed that Chambers and Hatfield had been able to fire and with what is a moot point . McDowell County Sheriff Hatfield , who had guaranteed Sid 's safety in Welch , had not been there that day . Instead he had been resting at Craig Healing Springs , Virginia . " I was greatly surprised when I heard of the unfortunate trouble which occurred in Welch . . . I understand that some want to know why I was not in McDowell County at that time . " Having pointed out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that he did n't believe his presence in Welch would have made much difference , and that part was easily believed . Three of the detectives were tried in Welch for the murders by a jury described as " terrified , " and , despite the overwhelming evidence of guilt , acquitted . This was the mass of emotion and violence roiling over the coalfields three years after the end of the war . Although the " Matewan Massacre " had happened in the old HatfieldMcCoy feuding country and involved members of the Hatfield family , it was clearly not a question of another mountaineer shoot-out . The issue was whether a man could favor unionization and continue living in his rented home , and whether , since martial law prevailed , any kind of meeting  | or statement advocating unionization could he made in the southern fields . The issue was no longer wages or hours or safety regulations or health or the right to strike , it was whether a man could instantly lose his home because he was said to have an opinion offensive to his landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blocked by the law . These issues were viscerally arousing to the miners ; they did not have to think about them ? they knew . They would take any violent action necessary to oppose evictions and the gagging of all pro-union sentiment by the law . The mine owners were equally determined that unionization would be resisted by any and every weapon at their command , most especially eviction and martial law . The irresistible force and the immovable object were about to meet head-on . Some dramatic act had been necessary to set them against each other , and the shooting of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers had now provided it . L65  | MIDDLEBURG rested in a serene aura of peace that summer of 1921 . The mortal enmities , the street murders , the terrified juries , were far away at the other end of the state . Such were the conditions of the roads and all the other tenuous links connecting northern and southern West Virginia that Matewan and Welch sometimes seemed as far away as Moscow and Petrograd . Bands of men obsessed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was peace and plenty . Lyle Catherwood had completed his senior year at Greenbrier Military School , and would enter the University of West Virginia in September . He was passing a summer of swimming , playing golf , driving his jaunty new Stutz Bearcat , sampling moonshine , going to semisedate dances with certifiably " nice girls " and slipping down to River Street with some of the fellows to have glancing encounters with " bad girls . " And he was trying to puzzle out the rights and wrongs , the grievances and the legalisms , of just what the hell was going on down in the southern coalfields . On this August evening the family sat out on the flagstone terrace off Clarkson 's library , Clarkson and Minnie in big wicker chairs , Lyle sitting Indian-fashion on the ground . Lightning bugs made their tiny noiseless signals here and there . The steady undertone of crickets ' screeching soothed the sensuous evening air , which carried a heady mix of flower scents across the lawns . The inevitable water sprinkler played lightly over the grass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many years now , settled over the Castle . Thomasina and George distributed coffee , cream , and sugar .  | " What 's a Yellow Dog ' contract exactly ? " asked Lyle . " Well , " drawled Clarkson , pulling on his evening cigar , " I do n't know where you heard that expression , but it is n't our term for it . What those radical agitators mean when they talk about the Yellow Dog ' contract we offer our miners is that when a miner comes to work for us he signs a contract not to join a union during the life of the contract . Nobody forces him to sign it . " Except , wondered Lyle a little guiltily , the hunger of his wife and children ? " Uh , Dad , what is going on about all these evictions ? It sure sounds strange , people out in the streets , children . . . " Clarkson thoughtfully drew on his cigar again , and then in a patient voice set out to explain . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just what we mean . Camps . These places , like Number Three ? uh , Bennettown , where Tot and Youranie live , that 's a camp , like an army camp . It 's there for ten , maybe twenty years , then the mine 's worked out and the camp closes . So , we ca n't invest a whole lot of money in it . Anybody else , they wo n't invest in it . Who 's going to build houses and rent them out when after fifteen , twenty years he 'll have no tenants ? Nobody . That 's why we have to build ' em . They yell about company houses . ' Hell , the men would be living in tents if it was n't for that . They 've got to have a store . Nobody else 'll do it ? oh , some fly-by-  | night people would like to come in there , run a store for a while , gouge our workers , and then move on . So , to have a good stable store we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to subsidize the teacher to get some kind of real schooling in there . We pay the doctor . We pay for the recreation . We build the church . It 's like an army camp and has to be , because it 's only there for a while , until we get the coal out , and then it 's empty . That means it 's got to have special rules . " Another draw on his fine Havana cigar . " One of the rules , down in the southern fields , is , no union agitators . If we find one , we have to move him and his out of there . He might infect the others if we did n't . " " Yes , but Dad , " Lyle pursued , " all the mines around here are organized , including yours . " " Ours , " he corrected , looking across at him . " Ours , " Lyle murmured . " Well , around here , you know as well as I do , the Company calls the tune , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifton decided letting the United Mine Workers in here would guarantee that the coal would keep coming during the war , so he let them in . Do you see what that means ? Marcus is no dunce , you know , and he thought if he did n't let the UMW organize here they might go out on a strike , war or no war , shut down the railroads , shut down the factories , shut down the Navy ! That 's what he thought those union people would do in the middle of a war if he did n't let them in here . So he did . And what could I do ? Sit around with my mines struck while the Company took over my customers ? So we 've got the union too . " Another puff . " Here . " But down around Matewan , " he went on , " down around Welch , down in Logan County , there we 've got operators who are ready to stick together and keep those union fellows out . Running a business is like running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there is n't , then there 's confusion ,  | chaos , conflict , strikes , delays , increased costs , lost markets ? there 's other fuels coming , you know , coal is n't going to have it all its own way forever . If we do n't stay competitive , well , you may see these hills empty , or with just poor unemployed people everywhere . The nineteen twenties are going to be competitive , and whoever heard of a team that was a good competitor if it did n't have one captain and obey him ! " Maybe we 'll all go broke around here in Middleburg before the union fellows are through with their demands for more wages and shorter hours , price us right out of the market . Well , down there in the southern fields we 've got our holdings " ? Clarkson 's voice became a little husky ? " and I figure I can keep ... care of you all " ? his eyes momentarily filled with tears , then sternly checking himself he went on ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my family , and if Marcus Clifton has led us into a blind alley around here , then we can go ahead with my southern holdings and be all right . If we keep those union agitators out of those fields . " There was an impressed silence . Lyle was impressed in spite of himself . Only once or perhaps twice before in his life had he seen his father close to tears . Obviously he was fundamentally moved by what he was saying , that his stand against unions in the South was a vital part of what he had set out to do in his life ; that Marcus Clifton had undercut that role here , but that down there he would be able to be his own man , and be it for his own sake , for Minnie 's , and for Lyle 's . " But maybe you 're carrying the comparison of an army camp too far , " said Lyle . " What I mean is , you pay the police in these . . . camps . So what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to show ? Are n't they just going to do what you want ? " X69  | " I have n't taken you around a mine in years , have I ? " " You took me once , when I was about fifteen . That 's all . Maybe one summer I ought to work in one so ? " " Out of the question , " murmured Minnie with a regretful little smile at him . " Impractical , " growled Clarkson at the same time . " Too dangerous . " " But these men work there . " " They would n't accept you . Think you were a spy . " He paused , chewing on his cigar , and then said , " Getting back to the police we have around the mines , what I 'm driving at is that this is West Virginia , and that means that the men here are armed . They had to be armed when they came here as pioneers , they had to be armed to the teeth during the Civil War with both sides riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're armed now ! It 's the way it always was here , and it 's the way it is now . What you 've got is a male working populace , mad as hell about imaginary injustices , and armed to the teeth . " He ground his cigar out in an ashtray and then said , " Labor is one of our resources , like coal itself . We need to have full control of it . The men in the southern fields are fairly paid , right up . . . close to the standard of the union men here . Up till now we 've had no work stoppages down there , such as they 've had in some of the unionized closed shop ' areas , and when there are work stoppages everybody loses , operators , miners , the public . " Lyle stood up and began walking around the terrace . " But these men are n't . . . free to join the union if they want to . If they try to join they 're fired and evicted . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clarkson replied , " What about our freedom , the operators ' freedom ? Why should n't we be free to hire nonunion men if we want to ? Why a closed shop ? Why should our freedom to hire whoever we want be destroyed ? " Lyle said , " Maybe that 's different . "  | Clarkson said , " It is n't . " There was a silence during which the somnolent summer 's peacefulness of the big house and the spreading lawns and trees and gardens reasserted its sway , an enchantment of natural calm cultivated by the devoted Italian gardener into highest cared-for order . Clarkson drew a deep inhalation of the odors , the heavy peace , the natural richness . This , from his point of view , was the meaning of it all . It would be absolutely wonderful if the lowest , most inept miner out at Number Three could enjoy this same way of life . Life not being constructed that way , however , it belonged to those like himself whose enterprise and foresight and managerial skills made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , and for the industrial system of the country to function . " But having the mining camps controlled by private police you pay for , " Lyle said a little uncertainly , forcing himself up from a drowsing daydream , " private armies , it 's like the Middle Ages , is n't it ? Why do n't just the regular town police have that job ? " " What town police ? In Matewan , there were exactly two men on the police force . We did n't even have any State Police in West Virginia until two years ago . And our National Guard . They came home from the war and disbanded and nobody 's ever reorganized them . So what are we going to do ? Let the miners , armed to the teeth , be the law ? " Lyle was silent , cogitating . Minnie never stirred in her big wicker chair . She had changed little over the past twelve years . There was some gray in her thick chestnut hair , but she still wore it in a 1909-style bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was still an aura of girlishness about her as she sat , in a filmy , light green ankle-length dress . With her right hand she was slowly , meticulously exploring the network of wicker on the arm of the chair . If she could concentrate exclusively on that , then the rising clouds of fear she felt filling her throat  | might subside again , and the haunting vision she had wrestled with for years , the vision of sweptaway happiness , of life lost , shining opportunities dead , that vision might fade once again . The organizing of the miners of West Virginia into the United Mine Workers was completed in the Middleburg field , and had advanced southward to the Kanawha River , on which the capital of the state , Charleston , was situated . In this area the miners had also largely been organized , and the unions turned to the last unorganized coalfield remaining in the state , McDowell , Mingo , and Logan counties , in the extreme southwest corner , next to Kentucky . This was the old feuding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , and more isolated than any other part of it . Although Clarkson Catherwood and other West Virginia operators had interests here , most of the coalfields were the property of " absentee owners , " principally the Pennsylvania Railroad , the Girard Trust Company , the United States Steel Corporation , and some European capitalists . No paved road had yet been built into this fastness ; the only access was by railroad or on horseback . Passengers taking the train from Charleston to Logan were under surveillance from the moment they boarded the train ; they never remained in Logan without being closely questioned as to their purpose in coming , how long they proposed to stay , and so on . If their answers were unsatisfactory to the sheriff of Logan County , Don Chafin , they were encouraged by any and every means necessary to return to Charleston on the next train . A stranger who seemed to be there on union business or to entertain union sympathies was of course not only  | sure to be sent away but was in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in boots and jodhpurs , a Mexican War wide-brim felt campaign hat , pistol in shoulder holster , and the manner of a military dictator , ran Logan County for the coal owners . By August 1921 , he had sworn iii and heavily armed three hundred deputy sheriffs . In addition , because he was the spokesman and strong right arm of all the owners in the county , all the economic power there , he effectively controlled what happened and what was said in the churches , the schools , the judges ' chambers and the jury rooms . Sheriff Chafin 's annual salary was $3,500 . In 1921 he was worth between $300,000 and $400,000 . More than a hundred pro-union miners and organizers were in jail in Logan . Martial law had been declared . Chafin 's small army of deputy sheriffs were efficiently seeing to it that the mines , worked by one hundred percent nonunion labor , local and imported , were functioning normally and without interference from strikes , evicted miners , or union organizers ; that anyone opposing this policy was run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken or written opposition to this policy was publicly expressed . As the hot summer of 1921 deepened in the hills , two facts were unquestionable : ordinary liberties and civil rights were being violated wholesale by Don Chafin throughout Logan County , and the union leaders all over the rest of the state were inciting their men to violence against him by every means . X73 J  | ON August 14 , it was announced that Frank Keeney , president of District 17 of the United Mine Workers , would address a meeting in Middleburg . This , Lyle Catherwood immediately decided , he would have to attend . Keeney had a reputation for being one of the leading hotheads of the union leadership . He was thirty-six years old , the father of six children , and a self-educated , aggressively Socialist fighter for workingmen 's causes . He spoke often of " the class I was born into , " which Lyle found particularly un-American . " Just about everybody was born into that class in some generation or other " was Lyle 's comment . The union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock that afternoon Mrs. Sanderson Clifton was having her annual tea dance in the Elizabethan mansion , the Manor , for the young people . Lyle was determined to attend both . Over the parquet floor they glided and bounced to the accompaniment of the six-piece band ; there was fruit punch from the famous Clifton crystal punch bowl bought in Venice , and a shot of something stronger for those who slipped out to 74  | the glass-walled porch . The girls wore short hair and flimsy dresses , the young men were in their floppy full pants legs . In a semicircle in a room off the dance floor sat Mrs. Sanderson Clifton , Mrs. Harry Hayes , Minnie Catherwood , and other ladies of the older generation . In their silk and brocade dresses with matronly hemlines , their queenly hats , their physical amplitude , they seemed much different from their children than heretofore had been the case between generations . What had been a difference in degree seemed , in 1921 , to have become a difference in kind . The very bodies of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no promise of the dignified bosoms of true ladies , looser in the joints ? and in language and manners and clothes and morals ? slouching , gone the rigidly upright posture of yesteryear . Looking on in dignified and concealed bafflement , the ladies of Minnie 's generation beheld their dancing daughters , who were beginning to refer to themselves as " flappers , " of all the unladylike terms . As for the young men , or " sheiks " as they called themselves , they simply lacked the substance young men on the brink of adult responsibility were expected to have . They were giddy . They were devil-may-care . They knew all the latest silly dances , they seemed to be sneaking alcoholic beverages into the most respectable parties and getting away with it , and these giddy young men would before very long inherit control of the major coal companies , and then where would Middleburg be ? On the young people glided and bounced and giggled and rubbed , and stiffer became the faces of the ladies . Minnie reflected to herself : here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in for perhaps the worst battles in the history of the coal industry , and we are a house divided . These Clifton youths , these Hayes boys , can they cope with five hundred thousand determined and militant United Mine Workers ? These boys here , dancing the tango ! And my darling , my poor darling Lylie , how could he ever do , arguing  | with that new union president , the one who looks like the most ferocious English bulldog in the world , what 's his name ? Lewis ? John Something Lewis ? Fanny Carstairs to Joe Boy Clifton : Do you know how to do the Tickle Toe ? Joe Boy : I guess not . How does it go ? Fanny : Well , if you do n't already know .. . Joe Boy : You did n't know once upon a time , did you ? Come on , show me . Fanny : Well .. . Benjamin Harrison Hayes III to Emily May Carruthers : Do you kiss ? Emily May : M-m-m-m-uh-uhBenjamin : Well ? Do you or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeky . Benjamin : It 's something a fellow needs to know if he 's getting sweet on a girl . Emily May : Meaning ? Benjamin : Just what you think it means . Emily May : I do n't know what I do think , Benjamin : Aw , come on . Emily May ( after a pause , pouting slightly ) : Maybe I do . Benjamin : Do what ? Emily May : Do what ? Benjamin : Oh ! I see .... Well , let 's go out on the porch . Emily May : Well .. . Lyle Catherwood to Elizabeth Ann Hayes : What do you mean , I 've changed ? Elizabeth Ann : You 've just changed , that 's all . Lyle : How ? Exactly how ? Elizabeth Ann : Well , like that . Pinning me down . " Exactly how . "  | Lyle : I 'm not pinning you down . Elizabeth Ann : Yes you are . You used to be sweet , sort of . And now I think you 're getting very cynical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , a man gets older , sees more of the world Elizabeth Ann ( murmuring slyly ) : Greenbrier Military Academy ? Lyle ( bristling ) : I 've also been to New York , Baltimore , Louisville , I do n't know where all . ( Getting angrier on reflection . ) I guess I just start losing interest in local ? things . Elizabeth Ann : Oh really ! Lyle : Yes . Really . Elizabeth Ann : Well ! After sandwiches and coffee at seven , Lyle accompanied his mother the short distance on foot to the Castle , and then , saying he was going to the Hayeses to play cards , took the second-best car out of the barn-garage , a 1919 Hupmobile , and picked up Fanny Carstairs who was a Clifton on her mother 's side and who had , in Lyle 's opinion , a head on her shoulders . She was four years older than he was : Lyle always found older girls more interesting . Because of the age difference Fanny had refused to go out with him officially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . Together they drove to the office of the newspaper , the Middleburg Exponent , to meet the labor reporter Lew Jenkins . lle would more or less smuggle them into the union meeting with the influence of his press card . Fanny had put on a voluminous gray raincoat over her flimsy , beaded party  | dress . Lyle still had on white pants and shoes , but he was now in shirtsleeves . Lew Jenkins was middle-aged , red-faced , thin hair parted in the middle , wearing a rumpled gray suit and a straw hat . Fanny had never met him , and Lyle had only the slightest acquaintance with him , across a poker table . However Jenkins had indicated on the telephone to Lyle that since he and Fanny were , or someday would be , an important part of the local industry he would see about getting them into the meeting . " You ought to tell your dads some of the things you 'll hear tonight , " he remarked dryly as they passed into the hall . " Might do everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Lyle firmly . Inside the big , low-ceilinged meeting hall what struck Fanny was the overpowering maleness of the group , the basso rumble of voices , the smoke from many cheap and not so cheap cigars , the number of suspenders visibly holding up pants , the general gruffness in the atmosphere . There were , she was relieved to see , a few other women present , but for the first time in her life she came face to face with the fact that as a daughter of the coal industry she belonged to one of the most thoroughly masculine enterprises in the world . The industry made exactly one concession to its women : it often named mines after them ? Minnie , Idamay . These feminine names were totems , like the ladies ' scarves medieval knights wore into their jousts . Nothing else feminine penetrated the virile world of coal : women were not allowed in a mine , no woman worked in an office capacity higher than secretary and telephone operator , and if the Cliftons were any example , no woman had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought as she threaded behind Lyle and Lew Jenkins through the crowded floor of the room toward their seats . Anything controlled entirely by men was bad ; she felt that instinctively . The Great War had been an  | all-male enterprise , and look what that had done ! Bled England , France , Germany and Russia white , destroyed three empires , caused the Russian imperial family , including all the women , to be slaughtered in a cellar , and left the " victorious " Allies exhausted , contentious , and much worse off than when it all started . That was what an all-male enterprise led to . And here was another : the coal industry , with its men of labor and men of management at each other 's throats . We 're in for it , she thought , we 're in for it . She sat down on a hard little folding chair to the left of the stage , on which there was a lectern waiting for Frank Keeney , and two rows of chairs , now filling up with men , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to settle into their chairs ; some man took the gavel and banged for order , made some routine announcements , and then with no ceremony introduced Keeney . Heavy applause greeted him . A smallish , taut , wiry man sprang to the lectern . Fanny felt that if someone made a provocative remark to this man , his first response would be to spring for the throat . " There are probably persons here in the sound of my voice that in the last fall election cast their election franchise for the present executive of the state , and whoever did it is a red-handed murderer , for Governor Morgan is as much a murderer as any pirate who ever sailed the high seas . " Fanny entertained a small secret scorn for her mother 's generation 's weakness of occasionally swooning , but now for the first time she had a taste of how such a thing could happen . The vehemence of this man accusing her of murder , for she had indeed in her first chance to vote cast an absentee ballot for Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she had gone pale . Gripping the sides of her little chair she heard the rest of his tirade pour over her as if at one remove ; snatches of what he cried out in his high ,  | harsh voice came through : women and children were being murdered in the southern part of the state , the governor knew this and refused to give protection ... The coalfields down there were going to be organized if it took every man in the United Mine Workers to do it ... The union had tried before and failed but this time it had five hundred men under arms in the southern part of the state and others were arming , and all Don Chafin 's hired gunmen , and all the companies ' thugs and all Governor Morgan 's Cossacks could n't stop them . . . If they were prevented anything could happen . . . Whatever did happen would n't be the union 's fault . . . it could be laid instead at Governor Morgan 's door . . . If the union met resistance in moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Matewan look like a sunbonnet parade by comparison . He moved away from the lectern and the hall rose and cheered and whistled ; a roaring came into Fanny 's ears , from the hall or from her own blood she could not be sure . She found herself being propelled past the heavy shoulders of crowding men toward the stage , and then somehow Frank Keeney had been buttonholed and then Keeney , herself , Lyle and Lew Jenkins were in a huddle , and Lyle was questioning him . Somewhere Lyle had acquired a pad and pencil . " Do you think your radical approach will succeed ? " Lyle yelled over the hubbub at Keeney . " Radical ! " His taut , reddish face tightened . " They did n't call me a radical when I agreed to forget our contracts and work for Uncle Sam during the war . Now they call me a radical ! Because I insist on holding what the miners in this state have gained . It 's an old trick . They 're merely trying to cover up their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this firebrand , Fanny thought , a schoolteacher or preacher concealed beneath the rabble-rouser ; a self-taught boy , once upon a time , alone among his books in the library , dreaming of the crusade he  | would lead , bitter at the injustices he , the bookish boy , had n't yet been , perhaps never would be , able to correct . " Do n't you think there ought to be some kind of cooperation between the miners and owners ? " Lyle shouted . " I 'm a native West Virginian , " Keeney shouted back . " There are others like me working in the mines here . We do n't propose to get out of the way when a lot of capitalists from New York and London come down here and tell us to get off the earth . They played that game on the American Indian . They gave him the end of a log to sit on and then pushed him off that . We do n't propose to be pushed off . " " Why are you so bitter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , " did you hear my speech or did n't you ? Women and children are getting killed . The workingman and his family are getting trampled by thugs and Cossacks . And you stand there in your party dress and ask me why I 'm bitter . " Her coat had fallen open , she realized too late . " Take your party dress and get out of here . This is n't a Chautauqua lecture . This is real . Some of the men might get annoyed . Get out of here . " " Come on , " said Jenkins , casting an apologetic look at Keeney . They edged and shoved their way through the sweltering hall and out to the street . " You two kids do n't know your place , do you ? " said Jenkins sourly . " This is the enemy camp here , this is n't the country club . Better go on home . My mistake . " He turned away from them and went back into the hall . " He 's got his nerve , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He does have his nerve . He 's not afraid of us , or my uncles or any of us . They 're not afraid of us anymore , any of them . " They started walking toward their car . " And I loved that , " she added derisively , " about if we 're resisted in going in to Logan County to organize it . ' If ! Does he think Don Chafin is going to roll out a red carpet for the union organizers ? If . I really love  | that . That man is bloodthirsty . He knows very well bullets will be flying in all directions . I think he wants that . I really think he wants it . " The following morning Clarkson left in the 1919 Packard , Uncle George at the wheel , for Charleston . With him went his assistant , Virgil Pence , and Lyle , to his surprise , was also asked to go along . It was the first business trip of Clarkson 's which he had ever been asked to join . Clarkson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) still a boy ; ( b ) a lightweight . This latter opinion he guarded closely in his breast , so that even Minnie with her sudden perceptions and uncanny insights had never glimpsed it . Clarkson barely let himself become aware of it , and then only at widely scattered intervals . But when some issue presented itself where any kind of weight or substance or even thoughtfulness would be required of Lyle , then Clarkson tended to deflect it : Lyle was n't ready ; perhaps Lyle never would be ready . Lyle was a good-natured , happy-go-lucky boy , and , just in case he never did , never could , grow into someone Clarkson could eventually trust the tumultuous management of the coal company to , well then Clarkson was making provision for Lyle 's financial security . He was a good boy , a winning boy , a warmhearted boy ... but there it was , inevitably , that inevitably repeated word : a boy . " Dad , " said Lyle , as the dignified limousine rolled over the curving , narrow , bumpy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I ought to join at the university next year ? Got any one in particular in mind ? " Clarkson sighed faintly . " Phi Psi , " he then said dryly . " You think so ? "  | " Yes . " " Why that one especially ? " " It 's the best , " said Clarkson . " Oh well then . . . " Clarkson returned to an intense interior contemplation of this labor situation into which he was heading . On the jump seat in front of him Virgil Pence scanned some papers on a clipboard . All three of them , and George in front , had doffed jackets , collars and ties in the heat . Virgil was lean and lanky , but he had smilingly declined to ride on the rear seat with the two Catherwoods , father and son , saying that the little jump seat " helps me concentrate better . " There were barriers and gradations and distinctions ; class lines and economic divisions shot all through the lives of Middleburg , from James in Bennettown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equals : for example , Clarkson was not Marcus Clifton 's equal . Virtually everybody was above some , below others . It made for a fundamental streak of uneasiness running through the friendly , unaffected surface of life in the coalfields . " I had a wire from the Aracoma Hotel , " said Virgil . " They 're holding rooms for us . Do n't have too many travelers down there in Logan these days , boss . " " I guess not . " Boss : Lyle had never heard his father called that before . It sounded , well ? funny . " My wife , " went on Virgil , " wanted to know , were we takin ' bodyguards in there with us . " " I 'm the bodyguard ! " exclaimed Lyle . Both men offered small , formula smiles to this flight of fancy . There was a rather loud sound and then the back left part of the car , beneath Clarkson , began to ride even more roughly over the bumpy road . " Damn it , a puncture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George maneuvered the gleaming midnight blue limousine off the paved road to a small gravel area . The men concentrated on extracting the spare tire , jacking up the left rear wheel , and effecting the transfer in the broiling August sun . The radiator was overheated , but this halt gave it a chance to cool , and with the judicious adding of cold water from a spring nearby , it cooled back down to normal . Cars occasionally rattled by , Model T 's mostly , with country people who seemed inclined to help out until they realized that there were already four able-bodied men and all the necessary tools on the scene . " It still beats train travel , " remarked Virgil as they climbed back into the car . " It 's cleaner . " " Trains burn coal though , " said Lyle , " and in these here vehicles , the fuel money goes to the Rockefellers instead of us ! " " True , " murmured Virgil . " I like to take the road when I can , " observed Clarkson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightof-way there 's so much old shacks and warehouses and so on . This is just nature as it really is out here . " " No slag heaps , " said Lyle . Clarkson made a restive sound . " This sure is a fine automobile , boss , " said Virgil energetically . " She really handles beautifully . " " Maybe on the drive back you 'd like to take the wheel for a spell , " suggested Clarkson . " I 'll say I would . " " We wo n't bother George now , " Clarkson continued . " He 's concentrating . I can tell by those wrinkles along the back of his neck . But on the way back ... " " Fine . I 've never handled a car this size . " " It 's different , " said Clarkson , " from a runabout or a  | oadster or any of those . It 's different . Massive . Feels like nothing can touch you . " " Except a blowout , " said Lyle . " I think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the engineering solved with these new automobiles they put out since the war . Do n't see much more they can do to them , I mean underneath . Of course they can play around with the body all they want , and that 's just what they 'll do , 1'l1 wager . Have to keep people getting rid of an old one and buying a new one . That 's where Marcus Clifton is smart with his Rolls . Just stays the same , year in and year out . I felt Packard was as close as an American car came to the Rolls tradition . " " It 's a beautiful car , " said Virgil . Clarkson took out a cigar , offered one to Virgil who smilingly refused it , and biting off the tip , lit up . " Ai n't you going to offer me one , Pop ? " spoke up Lyle . Ile often used slang colloquialisms these days . Clarkson heaved himself around to look at his son . " You never smoked cigars . " " Always has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " observed Clarkson , settling back into his corner , " in the middle of a sweltering August day on a rough road with gas fumes all around . " To himself he thought : if I 'd let him he would have taken it and smoked it , and in all likelihood been sick and made a fool of himself in front of Virgil and George . Where 's his common sense ? " There 's one thing about the coal business , " Clarkson began in a ruminative tone , unusual for him , but induced by the good cigar , the prospect of hours on the road with no means of working , telephoning , dictating letters , and a general feeling of well-being which had come over him as they drove along through the beautiful rolling hills , hills over-  | flowing with trees and undergrowth , laced with shiny streams hurrying over stony riverbeds , spanned by covered bridges which had reverberated with Yankee and Rebel hooves for four desperate years . A pretty , no , a beautiful back country , unspoiled ? there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timbered , freshly watered , sparsely settled , not really very good for anything , economically speaking , and this very fact induced in Clarkson a ruminative mood : here he was out of competition , as though in a great park , somewhere with nothing to do , nothing to calculate . " There 's one thing about the coal business , " he said aloud at length , " unlike the auto business we were talking about . People , the country , really need coal . We do n't change the design every two years to make the customers buy a new one , do we ? The very idea is ridiculous , you ca n't even say it . Buy a new one ? It ca n't mean anything . Coal is . Country stops dead without it . We do n't stimulate artificial demand , the way the car people are beginning to do , the way the people who make women 's dresses are beginning to do , the way people who sell furniture are starting to do , and so many others . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and sell it to them at a fair price . That 's why I love this business . It 's honest . It 's itself . It 's like being a doctor . People could n't live without us , could n't keep warm , could n't have jobs or money . " " Basic industry , " murmured Virgil . " That 's it . We 're basic . And I love this business . " A long , thoughtful pause , filled by several draws on his cigar . " Or I have loved it up until this thing we 're in now . I do n't know , I really do n't know , if the shooting starts , where it will stop . " At the end of a long , hot , dusty , bumpy journey they pulled into Charleston . It was late in the afternoon , and the little city was stewing under a humid canopy of summer heat .  | After they had checked into the Daniel Boone Hotel they learned from an associate of Clarkson 's that Charleston was also stewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marmet nearby ; at any moment these men might set out for Logan , eighty miles away , and try to shoot their way into Don Chafin 's stronghold . That made up Clarkson 's mind for him : " If there 's going to be a battle I 'm going to be on the right side of the battle Iine . " He made plans to take the train , with Virgil Pence , to Logan the next morning . Clarkson told Lyle to return in the car to Middleburg . " But Dad , I know I can help . Let me come with you down there . " " Your mother would never forgive me , " was the only answer he got from his preoccupied father . " George will drive you back tomorrow . " " I 'm not twelve , for God 's sake , I 'm eighteen , " protested I , yle , to no avail . The following morning , August 22 , 1921 , the three men got into the capacious back seat of the Packard and George drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little train , its four coaches and two baggage cars lined up toylike behind a miniature-looking steam engine . " You think that will get you through all those mountains ? " exclaimed Lyle . " I believe the line sticks to the valleys , " said Clarkson . " It always has got through . Of course , this summer , who knows ? Maybe the sky will fall . " " And I wo n't be there to see it , " muttered Lyle . " You go on back , look after your mother . For all I know , there might be trouble ? even in Middleburg . " Lyle noticed a curious look come over his father 's face as he said the last word , a flickering expression of desperation and disbelief ; it came and went in a second , but Lyle saw a depth of fear which even expressing such a possibility caused his father .  | There was therefore no point in arguing further that he accompany them to Logan . Good-byes were perfunctorily said ? sentimentality not being any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed menacingly , the whistle shrieked , and the 9:45 A.M. for Logan pulled groaning and hissing once more out of the Charleston station . Lyle and George turned away . " Take me back to the Daniel Boone Hotel , Uncle George . " " You got your grip in the car , Mr. Lyle . Why'nt we get on the road for Middleburg ? " " No . I want to go back to the Daniel Boone . " The hot , heavy weather had lifted a bit since the day before , and sitting with the windows open in the sparsely occupied day coach Clarkson and Virgil Pence settled down to enjoy the journey . There was a certain amount of soot coming through the windows from time to time , but the air was fresh , and the view from the window , as they rolled through steep-walled valleys , past smokily green streams , was attractive . Thin houses on stilts clung to the hillsides here and there . At the little towns where they stopped the depots were as sleepy-looking as ever , no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgil . " It is , is n't it , " said Clarkson . " And not good for much else , besides coal and looking pretty . These hills are so darn steep they say a man can fall out of his own cornfield . " " I believe it . " " Hard place for people to get together with each other . Never see each other . Ca n't see a thing down here , can you , except hills . Hardly any sky . " " Claustrophobic , " remarked Virgil abstractedly . " What 's that ? " " Uh , closed in , feels real closed in , does n't it ? " " Oh , yeah , yes it does . " There was a short silence and  | then Clarkson remarked , " Used to teach school before you came with us , did n't you , Virgil ? " " Yes , sir , that I did . Not too much money in school teaching . And also , well , the coal industry is what 's important in this state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thing that was important around here . " " And make better money , " observed Clarkson calmly . " Nothing wrong with that . Hell , what are we all working for , if not to make a decent living . What did you teach ? " " Seventh grade . Out at Mainchance . " " Enjoy it ? " " Couple of the kids were bright enough , showed promise . I only did it for three years before going to take some courses at the university , and then I was lucky enough to get hired by you . " " We were glad to get you . I think it 's working out , I think it 's working out fine . " A bulky figure stepped out of the coach ahead of theirs , crossed the open platform and entered their coach . He was tall and husky , wore a felt campaign hat , shoulder holster , jodhpurs , boots : one of Sheriff Chafin 's deputies . " You just entered Logan County and I 'm Deputy Shuttlesworth , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you folks ? " " I 'm Clarkson Catherwood , president of ? well , Clarkson Coal Company up in Middleburg , of Spruce Creek Coal in these parts . This is my assistant , Virgil Pence . " The deputy 's face broke from its stern mask into a cordial , formula grin . " Oh , Mr. Catherwood , sir . Welcome to Logan . lave a pleasant journey ? " " Yes , we sure did . " " Good . Anything we can do for you in Logan ? Your hotel ? " " All taken care of , thank you . How are things in Logan ? " The deputy settled a little on his heels . " I 'll tell you this ,  | Mr. Catherwood . Those troublemakers try to shoot their way in here , or come in here any other way , we 're ready for ' em . I figure you must think so too , sir , puttin ' yourself in our hospitality down here . " " Sure do , of course I do . " The deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Seem to be watching everything , do n't they ? " said Clarkson . " They sure do . " " Reassuring . Too bad any of this had to happen . But long as it does , reassuring to see our men right on their toes . " Checking back into the Daniel Boone Hotel , Lyle took George aside in the lobby . " Time for you to go home now , Uncle George . " " Yeah but Mr. Lyle your daddy said ? " " He was just suggesting . He really left it up to me . " " It did n't sound to me like ? " " But he did . That 's just his way . " " I know your daddy since before you was born , and I know when he says what he wants , that 's what he wants . " " Well , now you 're getting to know me . And I want you to drive up to Middleburg and look after my mother . " George cocked his head . " That what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I want it now . " " You does , do you ? " " That 's right . " They beheld each other , the reddish , taut eighteen-year-old and the seasoned , cautious , **26;29;TOOLONG Negro . Finally George said with wry cheerfulness , " Well , Mr. Lyle , you pretty well growed up now and I sure ca n't force you to do nothin ' you do n't want . Just remember , I tried . You be sure and tell your daddy that , hear ? " He had n't told Lyle  | to " hear " for some years past ; it was a token of the serious breach George felt was being forced by Lyle . " I hear , Uncle George , " muttered Lyle . Then , as though suddenly remembering something , he exclaimed , " Oh , there 's one more thing . I bet you 'll have some expenses you did n't plan on drivin ' back , what with me not bein ' with you and all . So here . " He slipped a twenty-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it as he beheld it with a certain disbelief . " And ? ah ? when you do get back , just tell Mother I ran into the Jameson brothers here and we went camping over toward Gauley Bridge . " George looked from the twenty-dollar bill to Lyle 's face and back again . Suddenly Lyle 's nerve seemed to break ; he whirled around , sprinted to the stairway and disappeared upstairs . " Sheeee , " hissed George in discouragement to himself , heading out toward the car . 91  | VIRGIL Pence had promised to write his wife a detailed letter every day during his trip to the southern part of the state . Like many people in northern West Virginia she thought of Logan as a combination of the Wild West , the HatfieldMcCoy feud , and the last remaining active pocket of the Civil War . A lengthy daily letter , they concluded , would at least partly reassure her . The Aracoma Hotel Logan , West Virginia August 23 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , It is late at night now ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even though I put the electric fan in the window this room is more like an oven than a bedroom . Mr. Catherwood has a larger room next door , and there 's a bathroom in between . Not very swell accommodations for the Master of Catherwood Castle , but I guess we 're lucky to have a roof over our heads . Logan is mobilized ! They 're ready to shoot the first union miner on sight . And the miners , I hear , are ready to march straight across Boone County , straight at Logan . Do you want to  | know what the sheriff of Boone County said when this miners ' " army , " thousands of them , with guns and automatics and I do n't know what all , entered his county ? It was in the Charleston Gazette . " These men will meet with no resistance from me . There are only three or four deputy sheriffs in Boone County . " ( Ca n't he count ? ) " We have no means at hand with which to stop them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Chafin did . ) " So far as I am concerned " ( That 's the sheriff ' talking ! So far as he is concerned ! Thousands of armed men invading his county ! ! ! ) " they are perfectly welcome to walk along the highways through Boone County . " ( Lily-liver ! ) So you see what that means . He 's waving them right through , right up to the Logan County border . This is a strange little town . I do n't know what the population is , but it 's a small town and it always will be , because the mountains go right straight up all around it . They 're completely covered with trees , and there sits the town like a saucer in the middle of these steep hillsides , and ? maybe I 'm getting persecution mania from all the tenseness around here ? but in this town you feel like a sniper is sighting down his barrel , and all set to pick you off . Even in the rooms of this four-story hotel , the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something might be ready to shoot me now ! I 'm sorry , dear , that kind of statement was n't the purpose of these letters , was it . But it kind of helps to communicate some of the things that go through my head down here that are n't too pleasant . Being sniped at is one of them . And , I do n't know , there 's something spooky , ominous I guess you 'd say about the town itself . Those hills overhanging it are one thing , and then a river cuts it off on one side and the railroad tracks on the other , and with the heat and all it just seems to sit there and stew , like a pot on a stove , bubbling and hissing . Heat or no heat , my head is drooping and I 'm going to try for some shut-eye . Thinking of you and Virgie . Your loving , Virgil ? 93J  | Aracoma Hotel Logan August 24 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , What a day , what a day ! Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything even though some of it will distress you ? it distressed me , but getting it down on paper and sending it to someone dear to me relieves me a little bit . . . I wonder if they 're censoring mail out of here ? Does that sound crazy ? Well it is n't . Newspaper fellows are beginning to arrive and everything they send out is censored . Maybe I 'm taking a chance writing you all this , but I figure we 're on the side of the angels around here , Mr. Catherwood and I. This town and this county are owned lock , stock , and barrel ? and law enforcement ? by the mining companies and I guess they wo n't censor the mail of Clarkson Catherwood 's right-hand man . If they do , mail me a file care of the Logan County Jail ( joke ) . I saw a bad sight today , bad , it 's why I wrote that nervous paragraph above , I guess . Mr. Catherwood had to have lunch at the superintendent 's house and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch place on the main street , a grim little street , narrow , two- and three-story buildings , gray . Well , I sat down at the counter and began to look over the menu . There was a quietlooking man in a dark suit sitting two stools away . All of a sudden the door was slammed open with a bang and in came this big bruiser with shoulder holster , boots , etc . Don Chafin , to be sure , and two deputies . Chafin stalks up to this man and yells , " You belong to the goddam union , do n't you ! " The man , looking completely amazed , says , no , he does n't . Then Chafin punches him on both sides of the head and says , " Get up , goddam you ! " The man gets up , Chafin smacks him on the side of the head with a gun , and tells his men to search him . They find some credentials in his vest pocket . Chafin examines them , hands them back to this stunned-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing here but preach ! " and the deputies give the man the bum 's rush out the door . Do you know who that man was ? I found out later . He 's the  | minister at the First Baptist Church in a place called Stone Branch . So you see , anybody can catch it around here , but do n't worry I 'm being very careful , and of course Chafin and all his men know I 'm with Mr. Catherwood so that 's all right . But I had to get that scene out of my head by writing it in a letter to you . I ca n't talk it over with Mr. Catherwood , it turns out . I tried to tell him about the beating up of the preacher but he just said , " Oh it could n't have happened like that , there 's some mistake there somewhere . " Something I saw with my own eyes ! He wo n't listen , wo n't believe it , does n't want to . Now and then , recollecting the look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , I ca n't believe it either . Love , Virgil Aracoma Hotel Logan August 25 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , Well , honey , things are getting pretty hifalutin ' around here . Yesterday Sheriff Chafin made a statement to the press and public . You know what his words were ? " They Shall Not Pass ! ! ! " Now ai n't that something . Using the words Foch or Joffre or whoever it was said at Verdun ! I mean , where 's the sense of proportion ? But proportion is one thing Logan has n't got right now , and I guess the miners marching through the mountains toward us have n't got it either . There are cocked guns everywhere , and sometimes one of them goes off . For instance , there was some man , a bricklayer , who was heard to say something favorable about the union . Of course he was arrested and thrown in jail right away . That was yesterday . Today , the story Chafin 's men are giving out is that the bricklayer got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went for his keys , and to protect himself the jailer was forced to shoot  | and kill the bricklayer . " Shot while trying to escape , " they called that old one . But it 's not all so grim here . Yesterday 's Logan Banner had an item about a man named Frank Olmstead . He suffered face cuts and an eye bruise when he tried to take the bullets out of his gun . The gun went off , the bullet hit the pavement in front of Guyan Valley Bank , and some chips of flying concrete scratched several young ladies standing nearby . That kind of thing happens a lot . If you 're taller than a shotgun they hand you one , swear you in as a deputy sheriff , and turn you loose ! Hell , the miners wo n't do half the damage stray bullets and accidental shootings are going to do around here . If only those miners would get to the county line and the two sides actually get into it , a lot of pressure would be off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of you all the time up in Middleburg ? it seems like Mars I feel so far away from you , locked in this hot little place with the steep hills all around and boys toting guns everywhere . If things have got to such a pass down here , can it be kept from spreading up there ? I doubt it . It 's one state and one industry and it 's one union and what happens here is going to " kick " like a shotgun when you fire it , all over the state and , it could n't surprise me , all over all the other states with big coalfields . Well at least for the moment ? Holy God ! What 's that ! ? Later ? 5:30 A.M. What happened was that a siren and some whistles suddenly went off shrieking in the middle of the night . Nobody told me that that was the signal that the " invaders " had got up to the county line . Everybody rushed out to the courthouse , and they commandeered cars to go up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other men formed up in groups ready to set off for any other point at the " front " that was threatened . Just now two aeroplanes ( ! ) took off for the front . You never saw so much confusion in your life , cars racing around , guns going off , and these aeroplanes ! Mr. Catherwood advised me to come back here and get some sleep but who can sleep ?  | This is some kind of a little war , and people are going to get killed , and I do n't know where it will end . Love , Virgil Once he had sent Uncle George on his way , Lyle went up to His room at the Daniel Boone Hotel in Charleston , and changed into a worn gray suit . This seemed to him a suitable d isguise . Deciding that all newspaper reporters , which was what he proposed to turn himself into , wore straw hats , he went out and bought himself one . He bought some cigars , a pad and some pencils . He bought some bootleg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to find a story . And if he did find a good story and sent it back to the Middleburg Exponent he had no doubt that they would print it . There were such things as free-lance journalists , were n't there ? Well , now there was one more : Lyle Catherwood . Oh , well , perhaps Catherwood was not quite the suitable last name for a labor reporter at this particular juncture in West Virginia labor relations . He knew that as a journalist he was supposed to be " objective , " impartial , calling ' em as he saw ' em , without fear or favor . Catherwood would not be the ideal name for that purpose . He reflected . How about Jenkins ? That had a nice classless sound to it . Lyle Jenkins . Now . Credentials . Since he was a free lance , nobody could expect him to have a press card , could they ? But how about a letter , from an editor , asking him to cover the miners ' story around here ? The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a public stenographer in the hotel , and Lyle had her type up a letter , addressed to Lyle Jenkins , authorizing  | him to cover the labor-operator dispute in southern West Virginia for the Exponent . When he returned to his room with the neatly typed letter Lyle took a swig of the whiskey and then , with a flourish , signed the letter : Neil Boggess . There . Now to find the story . So in his straw hat and rumpled gray suit , with his pad and pencils and forged letter , Lyle hitchhiked to Marmet , a few miles outside Charleston , where the miners were encamped . He found they had set up a large area with tents and fires , crap games and poker , and they also had guards , in overalls , World War helmets , and rifles , posted around the perimeter . " I 'd like to interview a couple of your leaders in there , " Lyle said , grinning widely , to the first armed guard he encountered . " That right ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here 's the letter . I want to tell your side of the story to our readers . " " We got an office in Charleston gives out stories to the newspapers . This here 's a military camp . No visitors . " " Yeah , but it 's just the atmosphere that our readers want . How the men are livin ' . What they 're doin ' . Well , I can see for myself they 're shootin ' craps but ? " " You get on back to Middleburg , or leastways Charleston . " The tone was not very menacing , but it was final . There could be no argument . So Lyle took in what he could from where he stood ? a whole lot of men , thousands it seemed , all with guns at hand , milling around , waiting , and , he could tell , in no mood to be interviewed by the likes of him , or , for that matter , anybody else . He returned to Charleston , checking out of the Daniel Boone Hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenkins . Then he sat down on the little bed in his little room to think of a better approach to the armed encampment at Marmet.  | Tomorrow , better prepared with a better strategy , he would approach it again . But the next day the encampment was empty , the men gone , On the march , the Armed March to Logan , singing , to the ne of " John Brown 's body lies amolding in the grave , " ew lyrics : " We 'll hang Don Chafin to the sour apple tree . " Lyle cast about for ways to follow . He was not going to lose his story . Aracoma Hotel Logan August 27 , 1921 Dear Doris Lee , It happened . There 's a war going on here . Americans are lined up in organized military formation shooting other linedup , organized , armed Americans . It does n't seem possible ? other Civil War ! ? but it 's happening . Sheriff Chafin and three hundred of his deputies are up in trenches and machinegun nests on Blair Mountain firing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our side has had its first casualty , a man named John Gore , a deputy , shot and killed instantly . We do n't know how many casualties there are on their side . How strange , talking about " our " side and " their " side . I 'm getting firsthand information about the fighting because there 's a correspondent from the Associated Press here , an interesting guy about my age , and I 've struck up an acquaintance with him . Think I feel lonely ? This poor guy is from Providence , Rhode Island , and here he is in the depths of Logan County with bullets whistling by his ears , some from in front of him and some from behind and some from beside . Still , he 's kind of hard-bitten , experienced . He was up at the mountain today and got himself into a machine-gun nest which was firing on miners a thousand feet  | below . The miners were trying to advance to the right or left , but every time they moved the machine gun and rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the miners were hit and lay still in the road . Here is the way his dispatch goes on : " The machine-gun bullets clipped the dust in front of and behind the two fallen men , preventing attempts at rescue . Later a band of about fifty men came down the road between two buildings . A heavy fire from the ridge , however , caused them hastily to retreat , carrying four or five of their comrades on their shoulders . " The machine gunners had previously been instructed not to fire on certain houses in the valley below where it was reported a woman , a child and an old man had not been able to leave . Now and then the child and the old man could be seen in the roadway during lulls in the firing . " Do you believe it ? Americans , and not even Southern versus Northern , these are all West Virginians and that means Southern and Northern , border state brothers , killing each other . Well , this always was a violent country , and now God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have gotten two letters from you . I guess the others are floating around somewhere in all this confusion . Your main good news is that all is quiet up there . And what you said at the end , that you never knew you needed someone like me beside you in bed until we were married , and now it feels " unnatural and empty and scary " not having me there , well that made me feel sad and very happy , both . Our first separation . I miss everything about you , especially , you with me at night , two people made one by love . With all my love , Virgil Aracoma Hotel Logan August 28 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , With everything so grim and dangerous around here it 's nice when something funny happens . This morning as I was coming  | out of the hotel a man with a pistol shot himself in the foot while trying to put it back in the holster . " My foot , damn it , my foot ! " he yelled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess ordinarily a man accidentally shooting himself would n't be funny , but somehow this event made me think that this little war maybe will eventually dwindle away . Mr. Catherwood is busy and worried all the time , because on top of everything else Lyle Catherwood has disappeared ! George , the chauffeur , got back there to Middleburg and said Lyle had gone camping with some friends . That kept Mrs. Catherwood calm for a day or two but then George got acting very queer and finally confessed that Lyle had n't gone camping with friends but just took off by himself ! He 's the kind that takes off , I hear . Probably he 's at Virginia Beach right now , swimming in the ocean . So Mr. Catherwood is trying to get long-distance calls through all the time , to try to trace his son , on top of all the business about protecting the property here , and not get shot ! Of course he 's nowhere near the front line and neither am I , but these rubes with their guns they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hear there are about five or six thousand ? yes , thousand ? armed miners trying to storm their way in here and Chafin 's only got a few hundred men , and he 's sending to neighboring counties for reinforcements and they 're on their way ! Just like in the picture shows ! My friend Hough , the A.P . correspondent , showed me a list he 'd made up of events down in this part of the state which led up to this war we 've got on our hands . I think it 's worth copying clown so when Virgil Jr . ' s old enough I can show him how things were and why this happened . Thatcher , W. Va . A truckload of working miners was fired on while passing a United Mine Workers tent colony . Two of them were wounded . Merrimac , W. Va . Three U.S. soldiers , who were stationed at a mine in Merrimac , were fired on while walking along the county road .  | Vulcan , W. Va . Several men , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambush . War Eagle , W. Va . Two members of the United Mine Workers assaulted a man at work . Sprigg , W. Va . The bookkeeper of the Crystal Block Coal Company was assaulted . Rawl , W. Va . A miner was shot at Lick Creek . Rose Siding , W. Va . An attempt was made to blow up the tipple . Vulcan , W. Va . Ernest Ripley , state policeman , was shot in the back . Chattaroy , W. Va . Three men who arrived to get work there in the mine were assaulted and driven away . Matewan , W. Va . Two miners employed by Red Jacket Coal and Coke Company were assaulted and badly beaten by three members of the United Mine Workers . That 's just a very partial list of what 's been going on between the pro-union men on the one hand , and mine guards and nonunion men ( " scabs " to the UMW ) on the other . And nobody 's safe and a lot of people are on the ragged edge as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And so are Chafin and his crew , and if you get right down to it so are the owners . Mr. Catherwood is a gentleman and all , but when you get right down to it , when it 's a choice between what he wants and they want , then he 's ornery . And it looks like that kid of his got a lot of that orneriness too . We still do n't know where he is . He checked out of the Daniel Boone and then just plain disappeared . Something tells me my idea of him taking off to Virginia Beach or someplace like that was off the mark ( Ca n't help using gun language around here ! ) . I bet he 's mixed up in all this mess somewhere and let 's hope he does n't get his fool head shot off .  | Excuse me for having to talk about so much violence in this ter . Let 's hope President Harding gets busy and puts a stop all this craziness , since it 's plain Governor Morgan is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you 're writing them and ' a just all the confusion . Kisses for the little one and With all my love , Virgil Lyle was hot , hotter than he 'd ever been in his life . He was walking along a dusty country road somewhere in Boone County , having hitched rides in four vehicles , rented a mule to cross a mountain pass , and now it seemed he 'd been walking for an eternity . Up ahead of him somewhere must be the rear guard of the Armed March . People along the road had confirmed that the miners , thousands of them , had passed through . How had they behaved , he 'd asked them . Had they commandeered cars , stolen food , beaten anyone ? Faces had closed like jailhouse doors at these inquiries , mouths clamped shut , except for the occasional person who would allow as how the miners " were just folks passin ' through like anybody else . " One woman had finally said , " They got a job to do and they 's doin ' it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to garner in Boone County the feeling seemed to be that it was none of their affair , that hotheads to the east of them and fanatics to the west of them were going at each other , and that they themselves planned to stand well to one side and just see what happened . On his last ride a man had suggested that he " get on over to the railroad and hitch yourself a ride on a freight car , " pointing out this dirt road . It had led up a narrow hollow and on and on , between steep hills . 1033  | Lyle felt what many people from other parts of West Virginia , let alone other parts of the country , felt on entering this southwestern corner of the state : feud-fear . He knew that the old feud had ended decades before and that his fear was groundless , probably groundless , but all the same he felt a reigning hostility closing around him . A bloody feud had risen in these hills , and the families , the impulses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself would have become involved in a feud here in any era ; it had raged strictly between native clans . It was just that a pervasive sense of hostility hung over these gulleys and hollows and hills , a stillness and a steepness and a waiting and a watching and a fear . Narrow-eyed watchfulness seemed to him at the core of everyone he had encountered , everyone he tried to " interview ? ' Hell , interview ! He 'd barely got the time of day ; it was almost as ignominious as his attempt to penetrate the camp at Marmet . Maybe he was just a little squirt after all , playing at being grown up . The memory of being more or less thrown out of the union meeting in Middleburg , and scornfully thrown out at that , burned in his mind still . He took off his new straw hat and fanned himself with it . Then he looked at the hat , with its red and blue band around the crown . No one else he 'd seen since leaving Charleston wore one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem . He did n't look right . They saw him as a kind of city slicker . He took the hat by the brim and got ready to send it sailing down into the little country creek running along below the road . On the other hand Lew Jenkins wore a straw hat . Lyle was n't supposed to look like the people here ; he was a reporter , a journalist , from an important paper in the northern part of the state . He clamped the straw hat back on his head . The hell with them . He 'd be himself and also dress like himself , Lyle Catherwood ... or rather , Lyle Jenkins , reporter . Firmly strengthened in his resolve to be himself , that is , his  | adopted alter-ego self , determined to " show them , " he stamped on up the gulch . Aracoma Hotel Logan August 29 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , We got the air cops in here fighting for us ! I guess it 's not the U.S. Army Air Corps , but we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're lucky clear Blair Mountain and swoop down over those miners ' lines and throw vas-pipe bombs down on them ! Sometimes the bombs go off , too ! My A.P . friend Hough took a flight with them yesterday ? he 'll do anything for what he calls " color " ? I call it suicide but there you are , that 's why I work behind a desk and he takes notes skimming along the treetops with machine-gun bullets flying all around him . If this letter sounds a little excited , it 's because I am ! You ca n't help but be . I do n't like it , but it sure is different ! The reason I 'm kind of keyed up is that the Bosse decided this morning he wanted to see some of what was really going on , so we got a Ford and a driver to take us up toward Blair and there along the road we saw a real war with real nurses and trucks with supplies and mules and machine guns , ladies dishing out food , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army at Fort Dix , except naturally much smaller . I hear President Harding said in the White House that the " insurrectionists " must lay down their arms or he was going to send in federal troops , but I do n't think those six thousand miners on the other side of Blair Mountain heard it , or if they did they paid any attention . For one thing , they 're scared . Hough says there have been raids by company police into union territory , women killed , babies , I do n't know what all . I do n't know if it 's true and neither does Hough , but what he is sure of is that the miners believe  | that it 's true , that their womenfolk and children , not to mention themselves , are just going to be slaughtered if they stop fighting and lay down their arms , that Don Chafin will come in like the Kaiser himself with a bunch of Huns and wipe them out ! So you see , they 're desperate ! As for our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got those aeroplanes and with more men on the way I do n't see how we can lose . They ca n't get past us , up these narrow valleys , so easy to defend , so hard to penetrate , and if they ca n't get past Blair Mountain ( " They Shall Not Pass " as you remember Chafin-Foch declared ) then they ca n't get to Logan and they ca n't win . And , anyway , how can the country let them win ? You know I believe in unions , just between you and me , sweetheart . But even the president of the United Mine Workers himself , John L. Lewis , said that the union leaders here " are trying to shoot their way into West Virginia " and that was n't the way it should or could be done . So . But they 're desperate . I got your letter of August 25th . I 'm so glad to hear that Virgie has mastered the dog paddle . So I 'm glad that for this summer there is something to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan August 30 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , I mentioned in an earlier letter the first death on our side , a deputy sheriff named John Gore . This morning after I had something to eat in the coffee shop I came out into the lobby and Mr. Catherwood was there . He told me to go to the depot to get a package that had come in on the morning train . I walked to the depot , it 's only a couple of blocks , and after I got the package from the stationmaster I was just passing the time of day with him when a closed car , a Buick , drove up and out got one of the local doctors . I already knew him by sight from when the Boss and I drove up to the front and saw him working there . He helped  | two ladies out of the back seat . One of them looked like an efficient kind of person , and she was holding up the other , helping her . The other one , a young woman , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to die , woebegone , saddest face I ever did see . Then she started to weep softly . The other woman tried to comfort her . The train was n't quite ready to take on passengers so they came in and sat on one of the benches in the depot . The doctor could n't wait . No doctor can wait in Logan ese days . He drove away and these two women just sat there . he efficient one kept trying to comfort this poor lost soul , weeping softly . " Who 's that ? " I asked the stationmaster . " That 's Mrs. John Gore , " he said . " She just got married up With him four months ago . " " She 's really all broke up , " I said . He looked through some tickets , and then he said to me , " She 's tetched in the head , that 's what happened to her , The shock made her tetched in the head . They was childhood sweethearts . She was ust stuck on him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be there right on through . " He kept fiddling with the tickets and never looked their way , so they would n't know we were talking about them . " That 's a nurse with her , taking her to Huntington . Insane asylum . " So now this damn war here is driving people crazy ! I think Mr. Catherwood is beginning to crack a little bit himunder the strain of it all . First of all , he does n't seem to ever sleep . He has about fifteen long-distance calls placed every day and they come through at any and every hour , including four o'clock in the morning . That happened this morning and he woke me up ? apologized , always a gentleman but said it was important I take some notes for him . Well , to tell the truth it was n't important . It was about some stock transfers and I wrote down some unimportant notes he dictated and to tell the truth I was feeling a little bit irked at Mr. Catherwood for waking me up in the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we 're back in Middleburg ( Gosh , I like the sound of that phrase , back in Middleburg , what beautiful words ) . Anyway , he asked me did I want a shot of Canadian whiskey .  | Well , you know I 'm no drinker , and never at four o'clock in the morning wakened out of a sound sleep , but something about the way he said it made me think twice and I said , " Sure , Boss , that would be fine . " So he poured us each a shot , and he sat down in the rocker in his dark blue bathrobe and I sat on the edge of the bed in my pajamas ? I had to put them on after he woke me up , you ca n't sleep in pajamas in this heat . Then he began to ask me about the kid , our kid . Was Virgie old enough to go to school ? What plans did I have for him for the future ? Did I believe in disciplining him , and how much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking about that boy of his and finally the conversation got around to him . Do you know what he told me ? He 's got the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency looking for Lyle ! Hell , I 'd rather have the kid trailed by mad dogs myself , although I suppose they 'll be gentle , or try to , with an owner 's son , if they can find him . I can see Mr. Catherwood is disappointed , real disappointed , in Lyle , and that he thinks this son , the only son he 's got , will never be able to carry on the Clarkson Coal Company , not in this day and age . I do n't think he 's had a very happy life , Mr. Catherwood has n't . Here I 've been working for him going on three years and I always just assumed that anybody who lived in a beautiful castle and had beautiful automobiles and took beautiful trips and had a real lady for a wife and a healthy son and was the Boss of an enterprise that pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else ) would just naturally be happy . Well that was n't too intelligent of me to begin with , and now I know it is n't true . It is n't true because he had some kind of picture , like a vision , of things handed down , that he was establishing a dynasty , that he was a king ( living in a castle ! ) and establishing a powerful institution that would go on unchanged from father to son and father to son , and now , here in the first generation , he sees that the institution itself , the coal business , is full of holes , that maybe it wo n't be King Coal forever , not even for twenty more years , and what was it , what was his life , all about anyway ? That 's what he 's brooding about and that 's the real reason he woke me up at four o'clock in the morning , to tell somebody a  | little about his sorrow , about this scapegrace son running off and this crazy shooting war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women going mad . And when it 's all over , he said to me , how will we ever get the poison out of everybody 's system , the poison all this hate and shooting and fear are letting in ? Well , I sure do n't know the answer to that one , and let me tell you when I finally got back to my own little hot room ? after a second shot of whiskey , he insisted on that ? and took off my sweaty pajamas and tried to sleep in the hot sheets , the sky was beginning to brighten up over the edges of those steep hills around us , and I went to the window to look out , the hills were all still black , and the streetlights were glowing in the street below , where it was still black too , and then suddenly a motorcycle came roaring down the street by the hotel and off toward the " front " and then some other cars came tearing and roaring down the street and pretty soon the daylight filtered down onto those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere again , rifles and automatics and holsters and cars backfiring to make everybody jump like hell , thinking some fool had accidentally shot them , and here came Sheriff Chafin shouldering his way along in his big boots and campaign hat , trying to look like General Pershing or somebody but to me he just looked like the schoolyard bullies I used to have in school , grown up now and with nobody around anymore to make him behave decent . Ah well , another day and life goes on . Love , Virgil Aracoma Hotel Logan August 31 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , The reinforcements have arrived . Yesterday afternoon a trainload of eight hundred of them got here from Huntington , and we were treated to a regular parade down the main street . A lot of  | them are young American Legionnaires and they looked pretty smart and like they knew which end of a gun was which . Maybe some of the boys in their teens can be put on the retired list now , Chafin can take back their guns and give them baseballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town in the hills . The good women of Logan had a hot lunch for these new troops , right in the lobby of this hotel , and there was a lot of general optimism , a feeling that things at last are coming to a head and will soon be over , one way or the other . I heard President Harding was going to send in federal troops , and if that 's true I think that 's the best thing that could happen . Somebody , something , something big , has got to separate these two fierce tribes ? that 's what they seem like to me , somehow , two tribes out after each other 's blood . Of course we 've got " the law " on our side , Don Chafin that is , but Don Chafin does what Mr. Catherwood and the other operators tell him to do and what kind of a law is that ? Anyway , the new troops are here , all riled up and aching to get up to where the shooting is , and up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people are getting wounded and getting killed , the miners ca n't get by Blair Mountain and nobody can get them to retreat from it either , and who ever would have believed this could be happening in this modern day and age , in this world we just finished Making Safe for Democracy . If this is safety and if this is democracy , maybe we 'd better start looking around for something else . Those miners are just plain crazy , and the operators think they 're the czars of Russia , and where is the common sense and the ability to compromise ? Are we going to have a coal industry anymore ? Should I have stayed a schoolteacher ? Questions , questions ! Doubts and confusions ! Excursions and alarums , as they say . Wounded people going by on the back end of trucks , nurses , women crying , terrified-looking children , scared dogs : it 's miserable . I know we 'll be back in Middleburg soon , and may we not bring this conflict , like some epidemic , with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at a little siding , a straggle of mining shacks , the sealed mouth of a workedout mine , a collapsing little tipple , and a sign saying that the name of this settlement was Mary Lou , Unincorporated , Population 942 . Well , all nine hundred and forty-two residents seemed to have moved on since that sign was set up . Steep , heavily forested hills rose behind it , crows and blackbirds seemed to be the principal inhabitants now , but the railroad tracks were slick and shiny , in frequent use . A train would surely come along soon . He had a sandwich and some corn liquor he had picked up in the last town , and sitting down on the railroad track , he ate a ham sandwich lunch not too heavily laced with whiskey . Then he moved off the tracks , over beneath a shady tree , to await developments . Lyle 's plan was none too clear in his head and he was aware of it . He simply wanted to get to where the fighting was and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send it to the Middleburg Exponent where he visualized it appearing , under his own name : by-line , Lyle Catherwood EXCLUSIVE SCOOP ON THE ARMED MARCH Youthful Reporter Penetrates Miners ' Lair Violent Shooting and Mayhem Described Exclusive Interview with General-in-Chief By Lyle Catherwood , Special Correspondent That would make a sensational impression in Middleburg . They would see that he had resources and courage they 'd never dreamed of , and , best of all , he would have obtained his sensational scoop of the miners ' side of the line so that no one could say his father 's influence had made it possible .  |p112I  He took another small swig of the whiskey . If he got a story like that it would certainly be " put on the wire " by the Associated Press and printed nationwide , for he knew from yesterday 's Charleston Gazette that the fighting here was getting heavy national publicity , that the White House was involved in trying to settle the conflict , that federal troops from Ohio and New Jersey were poised to intervene , that a flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Charleston , and that all in all he was quite close to the biggest story of the day for the whole damn country . But he had to get right into it ! No use to be close to , almost there , nearly . He had to be right up where the bullets were flying . And exactly where was that and exactly how he was going to get there , now that he had laboriously hiked far from main roads and wound up in this ghost town lost in the hills , with nothing to report on except crows and blackbirds ? Then to his combined relief and uneasiness he saw a coil of dust rising from the dirt road he had hiked along . It was a car heading toward him , fast . The car , a Dodge touring car , pulled up to the siding and stopped with a jerk . Two young men got out of the front , and a portly older man got out of the back . None of them was dressed in the " uniform " the miners had adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necks . The two young men looked like ordinary guys , in work pants and caps , and the older man looked just slightly like Lyle 's father . They had not yet seen him , seated in the shade of the big tree . They stood beside the tracks and seemed to be talking among themselves in a desultory way . Lyle had n't the slightest idea who they might be , but the fact that they had transportation and that they seemed to be going about something in a purposeful manner was enough to raise his spirits . He stood up and started walking toward them . Both young men saw Lyle at the same instant and both jabbed their hands underneath their shirts toward shoulder holsters.  | " Hey , do n't go for your gun ! " he yelled , trying to sound cheery and friendly , " I ai n't goin ' to do nothin ' . " He held his hands out from his sides and advanced more slowly toward them . The two young men were staring at him with the particular narrow-eyed fixity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through these hills . The older man , executive-looking , regarded him in a nonplussed manner . " I 'm Lyle Jenkins , " he said with a grin . " I work for the Middleburg Exponent . Reporter . Lookin ' for the war ! " He widened his grin . " That right ? " said the taller of the two young men . " Got any identification ? " Lyle fished out the forged letter and handed it to him . The three men studied it in an unimpressed manner . Then the spokesman said , " This here ai n't a press card . " " I 'm free lance , special correspondent . They do n't give us press cards , because we 're temporary . But I 've got this assignment . " " Driver 's license ? " said the older man in an expressionless tone . " That , uh , that got took off me , somebody done took it . " Lyle instantly damned himself for using such English on them ; they would now be sure he was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older man . " What kind of a paper is this Middleburg Exponent ? The jailhouse news-letter ? " " Oh I try to talk the way some of the folks in the hills here talk , because then you find it easier to interview them . I guess it 's getting to be second nature , I 've concentrated on it so hard . " They now seemed a few degrees less suspicious . " Well , son , " said the older man , " you 're making a big mistake wandering around alone and unarmed ? you are unarmed , are n't you ? " Lyle flung out his arms obligingly .  | " Yes , well , you might just get shot through the seat of the pants first , and then asked for credentials later . You 're close to Logan County and there 's a war on . " " I certainly am aware of that , sir , and my problem is to get to where the war 's going on . I . . . lost my transportation outside Marmet and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now here I 'm stuck . " The older man studied him , and then he said , " My name 's McQuade , T. C. McQuade , of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad . This is Joe Harry Beutel and Earl Sattersfield . They 're with the railroad too . Tell me , uh , Lyle , is it ? Tell me , Lyle , what 's your feeling about the situation here , the Armed March and all this , Don Chafin . What 's your . . . or maybe I should say your paper 's view of all this ? Both . You and your paper . " Lyle spotted it : the opening . Something good could come out of this if he played his cards right . This man 's an executive with the railroad , these other two are some kind of assistants of his , or else guards . He cut his answer to suit the pattern he detected in them . " Well , sir , Mr. McQuade , I guess the miners have their grievances and they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that includes the owners . But this here Armed March ! That 's insurrection ! We have n't had anything like that since the Rebels ? since the Civil War , and there was a lot to be said for both sides in that . But a bunch of civilians getting armed to the teeth and invading Logan ! It 's a crime , that 's what it is . " " And your paper , " said Mr. McQuade . " That the way they see it too ? " " Oh yes sir . " " Um-hum . Well , Lyle , maybe you 'll see something of this war . You stay with us , maybe you will . " Conversation tapered off , but by asking an occasional random question Lyle gathered that they were expecting a train  | to pass , that they intended to flag it down and board it here and ride with it into the war zone . Great . At least the railroad was operating normally , and he could be transported right up to the front . Almost an hour after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lonesome echoing outcry of a train whistle far down the valley . " That 'll be her , " said Mr. McQuade . " Earl , light up these flares , and Joe , get ready to wave her down . " Earl set the flares fifty yards apart along the track and lighted them . Joe made practice passes with his big flag . Then the engine rounded a curve and swung into view , approaching them steadily , not speeding . Joe began energetically waving his flag . The train bore on down toward them , the powerful thrusts of its engine roaring and reverberating off the steep walls of the narrow valley . " Why does n't he slow her down ! " yelled Mr. McQuade . " He saw those flares ! Wave that damn thing ! " Joe wrenched the big flag violently back and forth and the train pounded on down upon them , the engine roaring and hissing as it passed , the engineer leaning out his window . Two men behind him held rifles pointed at the four men standing beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five flatcars , and miners sat and lay around on them , all heavily armed . Suddenly the train was braked ; with a lurch the linkage between the cars slammed together ; the train came to a halt . It stood there on the tracks , engine steaming , helmeted miners looking down at the four men . From the engine the engineer and the two men with rifles descended and began making their way along the tracks back toward them . " I 'll be damned if I know what the hell ? " sputtered Mr. McQuade . Earl Sattersfield began to reach inside his shirt . " Do n't do  | that ! " ordered Mr. McQuade in a tense murmur . " They 'll cut us all down if you do . Keep your hands well away from your weapons , and if they ask for them give them up . " The engineer and the two armed miners came up to them . Mr. McQuade had apparently decided to take a hard verbal if not weaponed approach . " By what right are you operating this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he demanded firmly . " That there 's my right , " said the engineer , pointing at the two guns behind him . " Who are these men ? I am Theodore C. McQuade of the railroad management . These are two of my aides , and this is a newspaper reporter . You 're operating stolen property and this whole operation is in violation of the law . " One of the armed miners behind the engineer spoke to the other . " Let 's put this tinhorn executive on the train . He 's got a real big mouth . Be on the telephone next callin ' up Harding in the White House . " " Yeah . Step ahead there , the four of you . " " Wait a minute , " said the first miner , " maybe they 're armed . You armed ? " After an indeterminate silence Joe Harry indicated his shoulder holster . One of the miners took that gun and the one from Earl . " You armed ? " he said to Mr. McQuade . " You ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil . " " That wo n't kill nobody . Get on up on this car . " The four men scrambled up on the car . The miners there made room for them willingly enough . Lyle was simultaneously thrilled by his sudden thrust into the Armed March itself , and scared , and a little indignant , at finding himself a prisoner . " What did you flag this train for and let us all in for all this ? " he demanded of Mr. McQuade . " Did n't know it had been commandeered . We just had a  | report a train was on the right-of-way off schedule and we figured it was some U.S. marshals or federals or something . Communications everywhere are in a mess , of course . Never thought the miners would take over the railroad ! " " We 're takin ' over the state ! " said a big , Italian-looking miner next to him . " After that , we give you back your little railroad train . " " To play with ! " yelled another miner with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " muttered Mr. McQuade . Lyle wondered , was n't so sure , wondered some more . Maybe this was the Bolshevik revolution . They had taken f over Russia , had n't they , and that was just as big a country as the U.S.A. Maybe this was it , maybe the Catherwoods and the Clarkson Coal Company and the Castle and the automobiles and good schools and trips were all coming to an end , right now on the back end of a C &O; flatcar , and up at the Logan County line ; maybe behind them in Charleston and Middleburg other miners were seizing owners ' property as easily as they had apparently seized this train , disarming law enforcement officers as easily as they 'd relieved Joe and Earl here of their guns , and speeding along just as the train was doing now , toward victory ! Lyle felt fear seize him . Everything might be slipping away under his feet , a social earthquake might be about to shake his world apart . Nothing , absolutely nothing , seemed secure or guaranteed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain who he was in this situation , since who he was depended so much on his being a Catherwood , on having those mines and that big house and being treated as something special , from one end of West Virginia to the other and many points beyond , just because of who he was . And now ... who was he ? He was not even a real newspaper reporter . That was a fake . Who was he ? 117  | The train roared and hissed and clattered up the narrow valley . Lyle decided that the only thing he had left ? his false identity as a reporter ? had better be put to use , lest all identity desert him entirely . He turned to the big miner who sat beside him , shotgun across knees , chewing tobacco calmly , staring at the woods sloping steeply upward , and now and then expertly spitting clear of the train . " I thought this was supposed to be an Armed March , " began Lyle , " and here we are , ridin ' to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the passing trees . " You call this style ? " he said after a while . " Beats walkin ' . " Silence . " Where 'd you get on this train ? " " Up the line . " Up the line , repeated Lyle sourly to himself . I thought maybe you dropped down on it , from heaven . " Up where it started out ? " A long pause ; then , " Yep . " " Where was that ? See , I got to write a story for my paper , the Middleburg Exponent ? You heard of it ? We want to get the miners ' side . " " I ai n't got a whole lot of information . " " Just one man 's story is plenty . The human side . Wan na tell me that ? Ah ? listen . How about a swig out of my bottle here ? " The miner eyed the bottle , sized up Lyle briefly , and then helped himself to a swig . Wiping his mouth he said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lou ? Luigi ? Pantano had been born in the Pennsylvania coalfields , the son of immigrants from Calabria . His father had drifted down to West Virginia with his family and wound up in the Kanawha Valley , where Lou was now a miner , married , with three children . His explanation of the family life , both in his father 's home and in his own ,  | boiled down to one fact : there was never really quite enough of anything ? food , heat , clothes , medicine , education , recreation , and above all there was never really enough of the thing that he saw as most precious of all : a sense of security . Where was next year 's money coming from ? How many days of work would he get ? What if he got sick , injured ? " And them owners , " he said several times , meditatively , " them owners with their big automobiles . " " Yeah , " said Lyle . There had been the United Mine Workers in Pennsylvania in his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes even delivered ? a certain kind of security . And now the union was here , knocking at the last great bastion of unorganized labor in the coalfields , southern West Virginia , and Luigi Pantano meant to be part of the battering ram which would drive it through all resistance and conquer . " But do n't you think it 's necessary to have the owners , the operators , management ? " " I guess so . Somebody to handle the papers . But we want our share , fair weighing , fair wages , conditions , health . . . " " And you do n't want the Baldwin-Felts detectives . " " I get a hold of one of them " ? he clenched his big and knobbed hands together ? " I fix him . " The train , dubbed the Don Chafin Funeral Special ? words primitively printed on a long piece of white cloth hung to one side of the train ? continued on its way through the hills , stopping at little mining camps here and there where other armed miners climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat down beside Lyle after one of these stops . His name turned out to be James McDonald , he was a native of Scotland , and on the issues of the day his mind was clear . " The bloated capitalists and the economic royalists are bleeding the workingman here dry , " he began in a rather  | high-pitched , decisive voice with a pronounced Scottish burr , on the heels of Lyle 's first question . " They 're all absentee owners , living in New York and Europe . " " Not all . There 's the Cliftons and ? ah ? the Cath ? " " They 're all absentee economic royalists who 've never been to West Virginia and just bleed us dry , sitting in their palaces on Fifth Avenue and in Mayfair . We 're going to confiscate all their property here , workers ' committees are going to operate the mines , and the profits divided among the men who actually do the work . All those hifalutin ' economic royalists , and their lackeys , the Baldwin-Felts goons , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's all over but the ... the bloodshed . It always takes some bloodshed . Look at what happened in the Soviet Union . Our comrades there were forced to shed much blood in overturning the decadent old regime . Same thing will prove true here . But , never fear , we workers will triumph ! Look at us here , in control already of this great capitalist railroad , heading for the last capitalist bastion , Logan ! It 's all over , all but the bloodshed . " Late afternoon had cast this valley into deep shadow , and it was cooling off rapidly . Lyle longed for another swig of whiskey , but his bottle was empty . His stomach was empty too . Why oh why had he ever undertaken this crazy project ? He felt really alone , completely cut off from people he knew , defenseless . And they were defenseless too , his mother , his home . Why had he ever disobeyed his father ? What madness . And all just to prove something to other people , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game going on around here , no college-boy prank or Halloween trick , this was a civil war , a class war , an industrial conflict , and maybe the beginning of a revolution ! His family and the people he knew were in the front line of it , the exposed position , and on the other side from where he was now , rattling along with a bunch of his lam-  | ily 's mortal enemies into the night , alone , an impostor risking exposure at any moment , a stupid schoolboy and a desorter of his cause . Lyle sat by himself on the swaying flatcar , wondering exactly how this night was going to pass . Aracoma Hotel Logan September 1 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , Well , something is finally going to happen about this civil war , It seems like . According to the paper a brigadier general named H.H. Bandholtz is due in Charleston today to take command of federal troops , thousands of them , that are coming in , and these federal troops are going to disarm the miners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that means is that we have to stay in this hot little hotel more than ever . It 's not all so bad , as a matter of fact . Mr. Clarkson Catherwood is not one to suffer too much . His manager down here , Henry Kincaid , has a nice little house with a big screened-in porch on the river a little ways out of town and we can go out there now and then and swim and cool off . But you still know Kou 're in a war zone because the manager drives us out there in is car with a gun beside him , and he gets us back to the hotel well before dark , so he can be back in his house , everything locked up , when night does fall . Everybody is so damn tense around here that if those federal troops do n't get in here and disarm everybody soon we 'll start shooting each other here in Logan ? on purpose I mean ? just to relieve the tension . And things in the rest of the state are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial from the Charleston Daily Mail Mr. Catherwood showed me : How many of us would have suspected the ugly fact that in many communities are human reptiles , some of them with clean bodies and wearing clean clothes and walking up-  | right like a man , who ( as openly as they dare ) lend aid and comfort to public enemies . Did we of West Virginia fight to protect freedom from the German monster only to hand it over , when gained , to an armed mob organized within the very boundaries of the state itself ? Such cattle , canailles the French call them , belong in Russia . It is the one place in the world today where they would get that bellyful which they deserve of the miseries which society suffers when free government is overthrown by its enemies . Last night there was a meeting in Mr. Catherwood 's room of some of the other operators . He introduced me to all of them , and since the meeting was confidential and the names would n't mean anything to you anyway , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capital were all represented . Mr. Catherwood circulated the bottle of Canadian whiskey and the Cuban cigars , everybody got down to shirtsleeves , the fans in the windows did what they could to keep us cool , and they talked over what they wanted to do over the long pull . What they want to do is very simple : they want to destroy the United Mine Workers . " Nothing but a bunch of out-of-state radicals and troublemakers , " was one view . Some of the people at this meeting were out-of-state too , very out-of-state , but everybody let that go . That was different . Owners could be national , even international , because , well , that 's the way ownership , big ownership , worked . But miners were local , were and would be and had to be , and any agitator from outside coming in here and stirring the men up , well , throw him to Don Chafin ! That 's what Don Chafin 's for ! That 's why nobody asks any questions about Don Chafin 's methods . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them did , that the Baldwin-Felts " operatives " ( That 's what our side calls them , operatives , like they worked for the telephone company . What the miners call them I would never tell a lady ) , that maybe they were a little bit too " crude , " that maybe they were " rough diamonds , " but you  | had to fight fire with fire ; breaking heads was the only language spine of those rabblerousers understood . Anyway , these men , all portly in their easy chairs , easy chairs gathered from all over the hotel for this meeting ? in shirtsleeves , with the whiskey and cigars , look kindly enough , talk in calm voices , say " It seems to me " and " My view of that would be " and are polite and qualify what they say and sound so reasonable , but at the end of all the politeness and all the reasonableness they aim to wipe out that union ! And here is where they start , out there in the firing line at Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're planning to roll the union back to the Kanawha Valley , and roll it up and out of Middleburg and right out of the state . And who should walk in in the middle of this meeting but Sheriff Don Chafin himself ! All creaking with leather and clanking with keys . Very big . Never saw him before with his hat off . Never knew he could be so gentlemanly , butter would n't melt in his mouth . Deep but soft kind of purry voice . All smiles and confidence , charminglike . Said he thought the miners up on the line were getting all the action they wanted and a lot more than that , that his casualties were " the minimum you could expect , " but that the miners were falling over wounded and even killed " pretty regular . " Then he got real kindly and said he knew they had doctors and nurses and a hospital train behind their line and he was glad of it , to spare them from any " unnecessary losses . " He knows how to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do n't want to see it and they do n't want to hear about it . Family men , all of them , pillars of their communities , give to charity . I 'm not saying they 're hypocrites I 'm saying they 're human ; they want to have their cake and eat it too . They want to destroy that union and Don Chafin is the blunt instrument they 're using right now and they want him to break it and they want him to do anything he has to do to break it , but they want to minimize any feeling that they themselves are doing anything bad . No , sir . That 's for the other side . Got another letter from you today . It took a week to get here but I do n't care I was so darn glad to get it and see your handwriting again and read the news about the kid . You do n't know ,  | because you 've never been in a peculiar , isolated war zone like this , how strange it can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes . Just to see Mr. Catherwood 's face , for God 's sakes , coming toward me across the lobby of the hotel makes me almost choke up with gratitude ? just because I associate him with Middleburg , home , you and the kid . Now I can see how men got " shell shock " in the war . It was n't the shells so much as the godforsaken loneliness and strangeness . Of course it 's foolish to compare this affair with the Great War , but it does give you some of the same feeling . Well , I sure was glad to have your letter in my hands and hear that the boy is fine and that the doctor says that trace of anemia that 's been troubling you seems to be fading away . That 's swell ! Gosh I 'm tired . All my love , Virgil P.s . It is now 5:20 A.m. and just after I finished writing the above there was a knock on the door and of course it was the Boss , asking if I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " clear his mind " about some things by talking them over . Well , what was I going to do ? Dog tired or not , he is the Boss , number one , and number two I know just how he feels , the way I said in this letter , very lonely . So I went in there and had a little whiskey and we talked about the meeting with the other operators , and then he told me what he really had on his mind . The Baldwin-Felts detectives have picked up Lyle Catherwood 's trail ! They have agents inside the miners ' ranks , six or eight in the Armed March itself ? I did n't know they were as clever as that . They got a report from one of these spies that a young fellow answering Lyle 's description got on a commandeered train over in Boone County and was heading for the front ! This fellow says he 's a newspaper reporter ? from the Middleburg Exponent , how about that ! He sure sounds like Lyle . The Old Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight into the shooting . So he sent back an order to their detectives in the Armed March to arrest Lyle ! But how can they  | do that ? They 've got no power to arrest anyone , and besides , if a Baldwin-Felts man showed his hand there those miners would string him up to the nearest oak tree . I sure wish I could call you on the long-distance telephone and just talk for a minute and speak to Virgie . The line is open out of here , but so many newspaper folks and operators like Mr. Catherwood and Chafin 's lieutenants have it tied up all the time that I do n't get a chance . Well , you know I 'm thinking of you  - -  With love , Virgil Aracoma Hotel Logan September 2 , 1921 Dearest Doris Lee , Just a note to tell you I think it is just about all over ! Federal troops are in West Virginia and moving up toward the front . By this time tomorrow I think the shooting will be stopped . See you all real soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Don Chafin Funeral Special pulled into another little mining town . Lyle had dozed off , curled up on the floor of the flatcar , and awoke to see long tables set up near the tracks , and womenfolk behind them bustling about : food ! He clambered down with the miners and made for the food chicken and potato salad and homemade pies and apple cider . Delicious . It tasted as good , better , than anything he 'd eaten at home , but then had he ever been this hungry at home ?  | While he was finishing up the last of the apple pie , sitting on a baggage-hauling wagon , a miner came up to him and offered him a cigarette . Lyle was out of cigarettes as well as whiskey and eagerly accepted it . " Gee , thanks a whole lot . I 'm fresh out . Did n't plan this trip too well . " " That so ? Where 'd you start out from ? " " Mid ? well , Charleston . I 'm on assignment for the Middleburg Exponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . You with their bureau in Charleston ? Or you from Middleburg ? " " Ah no , I 'm from Charleston , but they gave me this special assignment , the editor 's a friend of mine . " " Seem kind of young to be a reporter . " " Oh I do n't know . " Then , to cover himself , Lyle thought it wise to add , " Matter of fact , I 'm still a student at the university . This is just a summer job . " " You 're acquainted with Middleburg , though , are n't you , seein ' as how you 're workin ' for the paper there . " This miner seemed rather unusual to Lyle , with his prying questions and all . Lyle took a look at him : broken nose , overhanging brow , chew of tobacco in his cheek , wrinkled neck , big hands ; he looked like any number of miners on the Armed March . Then why was he so much more friendly than they were , so much more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few days , and enough general knowledge of them from life in Middleburg , to know that by and large they were like a special tribe , almost like Indians on reservations , special and suspicious and private and uncommunicative . And here was this miner offering him a precious cigarette and questioning him about where he came from , or did n't come from . Very peculiar . " Where you from , Mister ? " asked Lyle pointedly . " Mingo County . " Lyle whistled . " Mingo . Now there 's another hot spot . "  | A train could be heard approaching , coming from the direction of the battle . It passed slowly through the station , heading toward Charleston . In the illumination of the station lights Lyle saw that the four flatcars held stretchers and improvised beds , wounded men lying on them , nurses and helpers standing and kneeling nearby . There seemed to be several coffins on one car . Here they were , the wounded and the dead , rolling slowly away from the firing and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People were getting wounded and people were getting killed . My God , he thought , one of those wounded or even one of those corpses could be me on the next hospital train out of here . Well then I 'll just have to accept that , he said to himself fairly calmly . That 's what it 's all about , is n't it , when you set out to report a war . " That 's pretty gloomy-looking , " he said to the man next to him . " You stick with me when we get up to the firing , " the man said with a kind of quiet authority which changed Lyle 's opinion of him for the better . " You 've seen some action before ? " he inquired . " Yep , " said the man , " a lot . In the war and . . . other places . You stay with me . " Lyle decided to do that . " You heeled ? " asked the man . " Heeled ? " " You got a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fix that . And I 'll show you how to keep the safety on at all times except if you really want to shoot . That 's the danger around here , " he continued , almost to himself , " getting shot by some goddam fool who does n't know a gun from an outhouse. " 127J  | The word circulated among the miners as they finished their supper that they would all sleep here and leave an hour before dawn the next morning for the front . Women and children in the crowd began assigning the men to different houses for the night . Lyle found himself assigned to a bunkroom with seven other men . Snores , smells , the primitive discomfort of the bunk , all were new and unsettling to Lyle : he slept badly . When he got up with the others before dawn he was groggy and tired and aware that he was going to pass through the most physically dangerous day of his life feeling as he did . Fatalistically he pulled on his shoes , planted his straw hat on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman brought to the room , and with the man from the night before ? his name had turned out to be Oscar Petersen ? beside him , climbed once more onto the flatcar in the dark . Rather quietly for a steam engine , the locomotive pulled them slowly out of the station and up more steep-walled valley toward the war . The war for Lyle began almost softly : ghostly , echoing rifle shots coming from somewhere far up the valley . The train had stopped at a siding , and these faraway shots could be heard reverberating down the valley . Hunters , they sounded like , out for a day of sport . Lyle 's newfound buddy ( " Call me Bull , " he had instructed . " Bill ? " " No , Bull " ) said once again , " Stick close to me , " and with the other miners , silent now , they clambered down beside the tracks . " We 're goin ' straight up this here hill ! " announced an older miner , apparently a leader , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side there 's a little valley , and other side of that 's Blair Mountain . We here are goin ' to outflank that mountain ! You all hear that ? " A rumble of somewhat doubtful assent rose up from the men . " We go on up this hill , " he explained again , " we rendezvous at the crest up  | there , a whole bunch of other guys are already up there waitin ' , we join up with them , cross the little valley and come up right alongside them scab lines . Then we shoot the shit out of ' em ! " A much louder roar of assent followed that . A tall , skinny miner with a face like a chicken 's came up to Bull . " Ai n't you somebody I used to know someplace ? " " Naw , " said Bull gruffly , starting to move off . " I think ya is , " continued the miner , a true mountain man whose " think " rhymed with " tank . " He continued to eye Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a louder voice , " I saw ya at Paint Creek back in nineteen and twelve . Ya was one of them tinhorn Baldwin-Felts bastards . " " You 're wrong there , partner , " growled Bull . And to Lyle , " Let 's get on started up the hill . " As they moved past him the tall , skinny mountaineer 's eyes followed Bull 's every movement . " Ya was thar , " he said in a level voice . " Now ya 's here . " Bull kept moving and Lyle followed , disappearing into the thick foliage and the trees at the foot of the steep hill with the first wave of miners . " Did n't stay and argue it out , " refleted the skinny miner aloud . " That 's the proof . " He took his shotgun off safety and headed into the trees . Aracoma Hotel Logan September 2 , 1921 Dear Doris Lee , We got a report that Lyle 's on a train with some of the miners ' " troops " getting pretty close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a Baldwin-Felts man with him , though Lyle  | does n't know he 's a detective . Mr. Catherwood figures that if Chafin 's men do n't shoot his son in the front line , then the miners will find out that Clarkson Catherwood 's son and a Baldwin-Felts detective have infiltrated their ranks and they 'll both get lynched ! ! But maybe it 'll turn out like a picture show . You remember that one we saw , Rifles on the Range or some name like that ? Where the cavalry comes riding in with their banners flying and saves the settlers . The federal troops are due here tomorrow morning , and then God willing it 'll all be over and I 'll be back home in a day or two with you and the boy and then will we have a reunion ! You know something ? I forget what you smell like ! Ai n't that awful , as they say down here . That fancy soap you use that I like so much , I ca n't remember the special smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out either . I never want to be away this long again . All my love , Virgil Virgil finished writing this letter shortly after two in the afternoon . He went down to the lobby to mail it , and there encountered Clarkson Catherwood . " That train with Lyle on it has got near Blair Mountain . The Baldwin-Felts operative is going to try to bring Lyle through the lines to our side . " Clarkson 's face was flushed , sweating , and not just from the heat . " It 's madness , suicidal . Tomorrow the whole thing will be over . They should just stay there and wait it out . But I ca n't communicate with that fool operative . Baldwin-Felts ! That man must think we 're going to pin a medal on him . Why does n't he just lie low there with the boy until tomorrow ! It 'll be all over then . No . Oh no . He 's going to bring him through the lines ! If one side does n't shoot them the other will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This will send Minnie straight to Weston . " Weston was the location of the state mental asylum . " She 'll never recover . Oh my God . Well , there 's nothing we can do . I ca n't communicate with  | that insane operative . He thinks I 'll give him a reward , for rescuing my son . He 's read too many dime novels . Well , let 's go up to the front . Let 's go on up . Maybe we can . . . we can . . . " His eyes glanced hopelessly over Virgil 's sympathetic face , and he clapped him on the shoulder . " You 're a good man , Virgil . Been through a lot here . Well , tomorrow it 'll all be over . You 'll be home with your family . Do n't know what I would have done without you . And I 'll need you more than ever for these next hours . After that ... " They were driven out of Logan and up to the base of Blair Mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here , " said Clarkson . " Let 's get on up toward the summit , maybe somehow we can . . . " And he left that sentence too unfinished . On foot Clarkson and Virgil began tramping up the steep trail , full of men coming and going , toward the firing line at the summit . Lyle and Bull advanced stealthily up the steep , forested hillside . Miners were filtering upward through the trees on either side of them . Bull kept looking keenly to right and left as they crept higher . Suddenly he nudged Lyle and led him into a thicket . They both hunkered down ; Lyle did not have to be told to remain absolutely quiet . He had a premonition , a knowledge , of what was about to happen , but he could not accept it , believe it , act on it . He felt himself in the kind of nightmare where running for safety is vital but your legs are incapable of movement . The miners were now more widely scattered over the hillside . After about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved into view , twenty yards across the hillside from them . Bull raised his rifle . Lyle was paralyzed . There was a loud , sharp report : the  | skinny miner whirled away from them and rolled over several times . " Come on , " said Bull . Lyle 's mouth , open , dry , tried to form some words , some protest , some indignant question . He could n't . All of this was not happening . It was a nightmare . He would awaken soon . Meanwhile he followed the heavy , hunched shoulders of Bull farther up the steep , wooded slope . Looking back over his shoulder , Lyle saw that two miners had come up to the fallen man and were bending over him . He could not make out whether the man was alive . " Get movie ' , " said Bull in a gruff whisper . " Want to get caught ? " " Caught ? How can the ? " " I 'm with Baldwin-Felts . You 're Mr. Catherwood 's boy . I 'm gettin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then that miner did see you before , when you were breaking a strike ! " " Too bad he 's got such a good memory . Move , boy . They catch us , they string us up . " What kind of a story was that for the Middleburg Ex-ponent ! But there was no time to think about anything like that anymore . The firing from the top of the hill was growing louder and heavier . This was unquestionably the front , the goal of all his efforts since he saw his father and Virgil off on the train at the Charleston station , and now that he was here he found only treachery and deception and an ambushed murder , danger of lynching , the long arm of his father , and a tinhorn from Baldwin-Felts , a murderer , hustling him across to the other side ! This was nothing like what he had imagined ! EXCLUSIVE SCOOP OF THE ARMED MARCH ? Youthful Reporter Penetrates Miners ' Lair ? . There was to be no exclusive interview by Lyle Catherwood , special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be . The only thing which  | might well make the paper would be Lyle Catherwood 's obituary . I wo n't die , he thought suddenly , instinctively , an inner voice , unheard before . Bull was leading him close to the summit ; he could see a crowd of miners milling about , guns and ammunition everywhere , their red neckerchiefs defiantly worn , ready to cross the narrow valley , lost in trees below , and outflank the enemy on Blair Mountain , an imposing shape , equally heavily wooded , just across the ravine . Bursts of fire from its summit now and then poured down upon the miners ' lines off to their left . They themselves seemed not yet to have noticed . " We ai n't goin ' up with that bunch , " growled Bull . " Too dangerous . We 're gon na slip down the other side of them trees , cross the holler , and up the other side . I got what we need to be recognized over there . Scared ? " Lyle shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , taut , very alert . But not specifically scared . Challenged . That 's what he felt . Be somebody , this visceral inner voice , newly discovered in him , spoke again . You have n't really begun to live yet . So how can you die ? It 's impossible . It 's against nature . Why would he have been born and his mother and Tot gone to all the trouble of raising him if he was going to be shot down on a mountainside in Logan in a war over unionization ! It did n't make sense ; it could n't happen . It was impossible . There was too much in him still bursting to grow , be let out , for death to strike him down , here , now . His city shoes taking a beating , his legs aching , hungry and thirsty , Lyle plunged down the steep hillside behind Bull . So long , news story , he said wryly to himself . So long , Lyle Jenkins-Catherwood , boy wonder correspondent , so long exclusive interview , farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left of him . " Get down ! " snarled Bull . " Crawl ! Fast ! " Like two E132 E133  | warthogs , Bull and Lyle crawled and slid and clawed down the hill . " Where 's the shooting coming from ? " asked Lyle . " Behind . The miners . " " They on to us ? " " Seems like they is , do n't it , " answered Bull with sour humor . " Yeah . They following ? " " Do n't know . Get up . Let 's run . They ca n't see too much with all these thick trees and brush . " Lyle ran and stumbled and ran after Bull . They were in the little hollow , and then they were starting up again , still shielded by the thick growth . Lyle was panting and gasping for breath , but he was not going to become exhausted . That was out . He would keep on going . He was not going to get shot and he was not going to get caught and lynched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way up the steep flank of Blair Mountain . This is no-man's-land , thought Lyle fatalistically ; you might know that 's where I 'd wind up in this crazy war : in between , in limbo , menaced by both sides . Firing was pouring down from the crest of Blair Mountain onto targets off to their left ; behind them the redneck miners were presumably filtering down through the trees into the hollow , and preparing to follow them up this apparently undefended flank of Blair Mountain . Then another thought struck Lyle : this guy here and I are going to give the miners ' secret plan to the other side , if we live ; we 're going to block their sneak attack ; we 're going to be sort of heroes , if we live . They clawed and scrambled upward . Now the firing from the top of the mountain , machine guns , shotguns , something that sounded like a mortar , was growing so heavy and so sharp that it seemed to be just out of sight in front of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket .  | " Tie this around your right arm above the elbow , " he ordered . It was a wide swatch of white cloth . " That 's our side 's identification . Them rednecks got their kerchiefs . " Lyle tied it in place . His head felt suddenly vulnerable , perhaps because of the unbelievable closeness of the heavy firing . The miners all wore Army helmets ; the other side , " our " side as Bull had called it , was probably even better protected . He had nothing but this ridiculous straw hat which he now realized with faint surprise he had automatically retained through flight and scramble , a talisman . His head felt as fragile as a goldfish bowl , something a pebble could shatter . I ca n't die , he repeated . It 's not going to happen . Suddenly Bull froze . A single gesture of his hand caused Lyle to drop to the ground and freeze too . " Clambake ! " Bull yelled in his deep voice . " We 're friends . Clambake ! Clam-bake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . yle looked up cautiously from under the brim of his straw t . Two gun barrels glared back down into his eyes . " Friends ! Friends ! Baldwin-Felts ! Clambake ! " bellowed Bull . " Stand up , hands up or I 'll blow you to hell ! " A voice eat through the surrounding clatter . Bull , leaving his gun on the ground , obeyed ; so did Lyle . Now I 'm in no-man's-land and we 're unarmed , thought Lyle dreamily . One false move and it 'll all be over . I will die . Or maybe these guys are crazy or nervous or marauders or something like that . " Come forward ! " ordered the voice . They started to advance Indian file , Bull in the lead . A bullet zinged into the ground just next to them . " You ! Get out from behind that bastard ! " Lyle sprang into their sight , and proceeded forward alongside Bull . They came up to the two men , rifles trained at their heads . Then one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That  | there 's one of them Baldwin-Felts fellers , for a fact . What ya doin ' out there ? " Bull explained to them who Lyle was , and quickly outlined their adventure , and Lyle thought , I think we 've made it . I think we 're safe . " Tell them about the attack , " he said breathlessly . " Yeah I know , " responded Bull shortly . He had not known , he had forgotten , Lyle noticed without surprise . Stupid but aggressive , slow-witted but opportunistic , Bull would always grab any credit within reach of his big paws . They were hustled off along the trail just behind the crest of the moult. tain in the direction of the firing . They came to a little ledge with a small tent on it . Below it was a larger tent where men were lined up holding tin plates and mugs . Milling about the first tent were preoccupied uniformed deputies , and to his amazed disbelief Lyle saw that sitting there in a camp chair was his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alone like that , thinking and worrying , not knowing anybody 's looking at him , older , tired , sort of discouraged , Then his father looked up and saw him . A disbelieving flush of happiness spread over his face ( My God he does love me , shot through Lyle 's mind . Why did n't he ever tell me ? ) , and he sprang forward . " Why son , " he mumbled , " son ... " They grappled each other awkwardly . His father smelled of tobacco and witch hazel , so familiar . I 'm safe , reflected Lyle , home , safe . Bull was in close conference with Sheriff Chafin , a frowning , formidable figure Lyle took an instantaneous on-sight dislike to . A military school bully , thought Lyle , just a plain , ordinary , paradeground bully who 's wound up in charge . Maybe the miners ought to win , if he 's the commander of the other ? I mean , of our ? side . Lyle said hello to Virgil Pence . Virgil looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope I did n't cause everybody too much trouble , " Lyle did . " Well , your dad did worry some , " said Virgil , " especially en he found out you were coming through the lines . " " Some miners figured out who Bull was , " explained Lyle . " They 'd ' a strung us up if he 'd ' a stayed . " Of course the decision to come through the lines had been made before Bull had been recognized , but Lyle 's tendency was ever to shape truth into acceptable , logical , congruent patterns , and in the process truth was modulated into a different key , to something else , well at least everybody 's mind was easy . What was the truth , anyway ? For instance , in this war , what was the truth , which side was right ? What was Right ? Did it exist ? Or were bits and pieces of it scattered all over West Virginia , from the Cliftons ' mansion to Bennettown 's shacks , and was n't this battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , when bits of it were in tact everywhere ? " I 'd like to meet this man Bull , " said Clarkson . Don Chafin was moving off , bellowing orders as he went , out along the trail toward the miners ' flank attack . Armed porn and boys trotted up the slope and out of clumps of trees to follow him . Two men wheeled a machine gun on a little n carriage along the path . Others carrying ammunition followed along . They 're going to machine-gun those miners , Lyle 's brain implacably registered . If it was n't for us , those miners would n't get machine-gunned . No , but these fellows here would be outflanked and some of them would have been killed . Where is the Right ? Bull came up and Lyle introduced him . He sensed that both his father and Virgil had to overcome some block before taking g his hand . " Well , you got him here , " observed Clarkson . " Yes , sirree , I delivered your boy to you safe and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set grin . Where 's my reward , demanded his fixed gaze upon Clarkson . " You 'll write to me in Middleburg with your address , " said Clarkson coolly . " Oh , yes sirree , " said Bull enthusiastically . " You got yourself a fine , adventurous boy there , Mr. Catherwood . He do n't panic . Takes orders real good . " Clarkson was silent for a moment . A sudden , savage burst of gunfire behind them indicated that the flanking attack was under fire . Bull shifted from foot to foot . " Well , I guess I better get me over there and see what 's goin ' on . So long , young feller . We done good , did n't we ? " " Yeah , " agreed Lyle . " Now let 's get out of here , " said Clarkson . " All this shooting . It 's a scandal . Well , this time tomorrow it 'll all be over . " " It will ? " said Lyle . " Federal troops are leaving Charleston by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners and that will be the end of it . Disgraceful . All these days fighting . A civil war . You 'd think this was Russia or somewhere . Bolsheviks . " They were heading down the steep path . " Uh , sir , when do you figure we can start back to Middleburg ? " inquired Virgil deferentially . " On the first train , " said Clarkson . " Tomorrow . Day after at the latest . " " How 's everybody at home ? " asked Lyle . " Fine . Worried , but fine . I , uh , did n't tell your mother you were with those armed miners . We wo n't tell her that . " " No . " Clarkson was walking in front , Lyle behind , and Virgil was bringing up the rear . Now and then two or three armed men would hurry past them , eagerly mounting the path to join in the repulse of the miners ' attack .  | They rounded a curve in the steeply descending path . Two en and a boy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped past them , then Lyle ; as Virgil folwed he lost his footing , slipped feet first ; his feet hit the boy 's ; the boy stumbled forward over him ; the large revolver held in his right hand exploded with noise ; blood suddenly rst from Virgil Pence 's mouth . Lyle , transfixed , disbelieving , stared for several unreal onds at this impossible blood , the terrifying pallor coming into Virgil 's face . Then he rushed toward him . By the time they got him to the bottom of the mountain he was dead . By noontime the following day total peace had returned to lair Mountain . Federal troops arrived from Charleston behind the miners ' lines , and the miners readily surrendered their weapons to them , trotting one by one into tents to drop their firearms at the feet of the troops . If some miners melted into the hills to hide their shotguns and ammunition against the day of some possible renewal of shooting , that was just mountaineer cautiousness . The guns were put away . Don Chafin and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining camps as avengers of insurrection , but backward upon Logan , to resume their usual duties . The case , the charges and countercharges , the accusations and appeals , all disappeared into the courts , where they simmered and bubbled for years . Tempers settled down to normal : banked , silent resentment among the miners , uneasy , watchful triumph among the owners . They had won ; Don Chafin 's grandiloquent battle cry , " They Shall Not Pass , " had been lived up to : they  | had not passed . " They " faded back into their camps , up the steep-walled hollows , down into the pits , unorganized , their United Mine Workers repulsed , redress of grievances at a standstill . A silence , that is , the absence of war sounds , descended over all of the counties of southwestern West Virginia . It was not peace ; it was waiting , more waiting on the part of miners who had already waited for a long time . George was on hand to meet Clarkson and Lyle at the Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Middleburg was there to take the casket . Clarkson and Lyle climbed into the rear seat of the big limousine after they , George and some porters had dealt with the baggage and the casket . Lyle had bought several big bunches of flowers in Logan , and these he rearranged on and around the casket in the hearse . Then the two vehicles , the Packard in the lead , set out on the long , wearying drive north to Middleburg . " What am I ? what are we going to say to Mrs. Pence ? " asked Lyle agonizingly once again . " We can only tell her the truth . " " How did she sound on the telephone ? " Stunned . Numb . " " She wo n't be by the time we get there . " " I hope not . It would be very unhealthy for her if she was . " " What 'll I say to her ? " " All we have to deal with is the truth . " Clarkson looked abstractedly at the back of his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have been up there at that damn front line except for me. " 140  | " Yes . Circumstances ca n't always be foreseen . " Clarkson slowly peeled the foil from a cigar , methodically pierced it , deliberately lighted it . He did not seem , to Lyle , to be taking anything like his usual pleasure in any of this . It was more as though he was looking for something , anything , to occupy his hands , and by extension , perhaps , his mind as well . Then Clarkson went on , " He would n't have been there except for me too . I asked him to go up there with me . " Elbows on knees , reddish face sunk in hands , Lyle mumbled , " And you would n't have wanted to go up there except for me . " There was a silence in the car as George shifted gears to climb a steep incline . The big engine rumbled expensively . " Am I just no good at all , Dad ? " " Now son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people think it , thought it before , and now ... " " What happened to Virgil was a pure accident . " Lyle did n't speak for a while . Then he said , " No , it really was n't . It was the result of me acting like a fool . " They reached Middleburg after dark . At the Castle Lyle greeted his mother . She did not reproach him ; there was very little conversation of any sort . Lyle fiddled with a supper prepared for him in the kitchen and then went to his room , at the back of the house , looking toward the barn . A little crenellated balcony opened off it . He stood out there alone it large part of the night , watching the sky ? a stunning , limit less September night sky ? until dawn began to edge the rolling hills with a pink-orange glow ; the stars , more remote than ever , withdrew , and Lyle prepared to call upon Mrs. Virgil Pence , widow , and her child . His father declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother and I will call on her later today if that 's all right . You should make this call by yourself . " So that reduced Lyle 's choices to two : to have a few drinks  | before going , or not to have a few drinks before going . Ile was about to face the worst interview of his life . Well he certainly could not appear drunk at Mrs. Pence 's , adding insult to injury , mortal injury . On the other hand , to go there without any kind of inner reinforcement called for a kind of fortitude which he felt that , on this particular morn ? ing at least , he did not have . After he had gone to bed , banks of clouds had drifted overhead and now it was a lowering day , September rainfall promised at any moment . Lyle went to his closet , removed a small panel in the wall at the back of it , took out a bottle of Canadian whiskey , gulped down several swigs , took a stick of chewing gum from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and closing the panel , strode around the room briskly chewing to take the whiskey smell off his breath . Then , dressed in a gray suit and a black tie , he went downstairs , out to the barn , and got behind the wheel of the little Ford . He was not going to arrive at the Pence house in a Packard or a Stutz racing car . The Pences lived on Overlook Street , where the frame houses were set a few feet apart from each other , high on a steep hill close to the center of town . There were several cars parked at the curb . Lyle went up to the front door and knocked . A young man came to the door , familiar-looking somehow . " I 'm Lyle Catherwood . " " Hello . I 'm Earl Pence . " A younger brother . Lyle stepped into the small , dark front hall . On the right was a small living room , and la id out in an open casket there , framed by a number of baskets of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to burst out laughing . I really am trying to destroy myself , some part of his mind reflected objectively . Doris Lee Pence emerged from another dark little room , a dining room , and came up to him . She was rather tall , and  | her face was pale but composed . She had on a severe black ress , and its simplicity made Lyle notice her face particularly : it had a delicate shapeliness . They sat down on a all couch in front of a window . Through the window the neighbor 's house was so close that Lyle was sure they could overhear anything said . From this couch the raised casket lid was visible , not Virgil 's body . " Mrs. Pence , I just came to express my ? the family 's ? everybody 's so very sorry . This is terrible . We 're all so very sorry . I know that Dad ... I know that .. . well , pensions . . . well I know this is n't the time I just have to say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all and I know sorry is a cheap word but I have to say that and I hope you can understand and someday forgive . " She was nodding slowly , looking at the floor . " I guess it was the will of the Lord , " she murmured . " Sometimes the Lord is very hard to understand . But it 's not for us to understand , I guess , just " ? here her voice grew suddenly tremulous ? " accept . " " Can you forgive ? " " Forgive ? The Lord ? " " No , I mean , fate , and well , we uh ? we , the family , the Company going to Logan with the shooting going on and ? " She sighed tiredly . " It was just some accident . Could have been hit by a car out in front here . The Clark boy was , just last summer . " " I see what you mean . " " The Lord 's will . " " Mrs. Pence , I have got to tell you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her eyes ? they were a kind of green , he saw , shapely , intelligent ? to look at him for the first time . " How can you feel anything like that ? " she asked . " Well you see when Dad and Virgil went down to Logan I kind of felt left out . They left me in Charleston with George ,  | that 's our driver , and said to come back here . Well that made me feel real left out and so I got an idea to pose like I was a journalist ? A reporter ? And I faked some credentials and I got up with the miners ' army , right on the train with them and right into the battle zone . There was a detective there , a company detective , and he brought me through the lines , over to the owners ' side . And Dad knew I was coming through and he was worried and he and Virgil ? that 's why he and Virgil , they went up to the front because ? " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been following what he said with gathering concentration and finally her hands came over her eyes and she cried , " Oh what does it matter ! He 's gone . He should have stayed a schoolteacher ! That 's where he belonged . That 's what he loved ! And they loved him , the children , but l ? I wanted more things ! Yes . Better clothes , I said . Our child 's future , I said . All things like that , he could n't argue against , not Virgil could n't . So I was getting them , beginning to . We were going to build a house , out toward the country club . I wanted that too . I wanted the ladies to call on me . And now you see what happened . Coal 's a funny business , ' he kept telling me , ' dangerous . " But you wo n't be in the mines , ' I said . It 's safe in the office : I know I 'll hardly ever be in the mines , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of violence buried in there : " She drew a long breath . " If you 're responsible , " she said , " then I am too . " Lyle felt slightly and strangely shocked by what she was telling him . Life certainly was a lot more complicated than he had realized . Outside he set the spark and began to crank the Model T. I 'm not responsible for everything that happens in the world . These words broke over him with the force of an epiphany . It just seems that way , to me . But I 'm not . I 'm just a cog ,  | like everybody else . All attention is not always focused on me . In fact , it hardly ever is , for the simple reason that most people are thinking almost all the time about themselves . I am not in any way , shape or form responsible for all the things , most of all the bad things , which happen in the world . The glorious panorama of last night 's sky recurred to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cog , me . I am not responsible for all these things which happen . 01451  | IF Lyle was not going to be a great newspaper correspondent , what was he going to be ? A coal operator ? It did n't attract him . He sincerely found a lump of coal itself beautiful , when it was washed clean as Clarkson coal was , blue-black , lustrous , truly a black diamond , and just as valuable when you stopped to think that it heated the whole country and made every train run from Maine to California . But mining , coal mining itself , had made a radically different impression on him . Four years earlier he had finally persuaded his father to let him go into a mine , expecting he did n't know what , and finding a strangely dangerous netherworld of clammy deadness . When Clarkson had agreed , at dinnertime four years earlier , Minnie 's eyes had roamed over her fourteen-year-old son and had asked a little tremulously , " Should he , really ? " " He 's got to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . Down at school the fellows want to know about them all the time . " Lyle had entered Greenbrier Military Academy in southern West Virginia that fall .  | " The boy 's got to know a little of what he 's talking about , " mid Clarkson . Minnie cast a piteous glance at him and then looked away . " What mothers of miners must go through , " she muttered . Clarkson had planned to take Lyle into Number Seven , his most productive and mechanized mine , but that day he was called down to Number Three , Bennettown , and since Lyle had to return to school the next day Clarkson decided a quick visit to this old mine would have to do . " It 's an oldfashioned place , " he warned Lyle . " We have lots better operations . But it 'll give you the feel of mining , anyhow . And James is down there . He can take you in . I 'll have to do some work in the office . " James , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the shift working when Clarkson and Ij Lyle arrived in the Hupmobile ? the Packard was never taken to the mines ? and so he took Lyle in charge . Wearing work clothes and heavy shoes , James led Lyle into a little shed where he was given a cap with a lamp on it , which made him feel very professional . The coal being processed by the machinery in the tipple made a rattling background noise which filled the tight little valley , combined with the small , clattering coal cars rolling in groups into the mine empty and out full from time to time . James and Lyle went through the entrance , a concrete-lined opening in the side of the hill , and instantly a chill settled over them in this black-walled tunnel , which was just a little higher than James 's head . The black seam of coal with the tunnel blasted through it sank into the hill more and more deeply . To Lyle it seemed that the massiveness of the black , clammy , rocklike walls around and above them shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone in the mine in the crushing , sterile , dead weight of black rock , massive and pitiless  | and cold . He walked cautiously farther into this inhuman , heavy , reverberating place , clammy and chilly and eerie , as seen by its scattered electric lights and the flimsy illumination from the lamps on their heads . After walking about three quarters of a mile , turning into various branches from the main tunnel , they came to what James called a " room , " off to one side , where two miners were working . The distance between the floor and the ceiling of this room was about four feet . At the far end of it was the wall of coal being currently worked , the " face . " The men were lying down next to it , in a puddle of water , hacking away with their picks at the bottom of the face , to undercut it . Lyle recalled how James had explained in a soft , deferential , sometimes apologetic way which embarrassed this fourteen-year-old boss 's son what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what everything was called . After undercutting the face with their picks , one of them took an auger , a rotating boring tool , bracing it against his leg , and drilled a hole into the rocklike coal . Then they rolled a piece of newspaper into a tube shape , filled it with six inches of dynamite , inserted it into the hole , pushed a thin copper pin into the powder , filled the front of the hole with tamped bits of coal , removed the rod , inserted a long fuse , retreated to the other side of the room and lit the fuse . There was a muffled , mine-shaking explosion , and the coal tumbled into the room in a thick cloud of gritty smoke . Now the real work began . They pushed a small coal car forward into the room , along a spur of track which they had laid themselves . This little coal car was extremely heavy and required great effort to push it into position . Lyle moved to help but was instantly checked by James . Then , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men began shoveling the pieces of coal into the car . There was not much space between the top of the car and the roof of the room , and it  | took some skill to sling the coal into the car instead of against the side or off the roof . Once loaded , the car was pushed up a very slight , but because of the weight of the car now loaded with coal , backbreaking slope , out of the room , where it then went onto a downgrade and into the main tunnel . Here an art called " shoving the sprang " came into play . The sprang was a piece of wood which had to be shoved through one of the holes of the moving wheel and pushed against the bed of the car to slow it down . Without that , the car could easily derail , and putting it back on the rails was a time-consuming exertion in a class by itself . " When do you eat down here ? " asked Lyle . " Round about the middle of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time ? " " Oh no , you do n't git paid for time , you git paid for the coal you gits out . " " Oh . " " Rats sit an ' watch us while we eat , " he said smiling . " Ye gods . " " Steal our food if it ai n't sealed in real good . " ? " Gosh . " " Cute little critters . " " Rats ? " " Yep . Never will work in a mine without ' em . Bad luck . Rats , they know when the mine 's gon na blow . Some says they even know when they 's gon na be a cave-in . Rats leave a mine or part of a mine , some of the men , they leave too . Smart little critters . Cute too . " " Cute ? " James drew a long breath . " Down there , it gets cold , colder than this . It 's wet too , lot of the time . Ai n't nothin ' grows . No sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just gets to be like some place out of this world , nothin ' livin ' , just that there black rock , everyplace , black rock , it 's cold , this funny  | air , explosions all the time , dust , it ai n't like noplace on this earth , and nothin ' livin " cept these cute little furry critters . They 's pets like . We feed ' em if they ai n't already stole enough for the day . They 's company . They 's down there with us . " Got to watch out for them cold months down in the mines . " " The cold months ? Why ? " " Do n't know , Mr. Lyle . Nobody knows , I guess . But that 's when they 's dangerous . Somethin ' about dryin ' out , the mine dries out in the cold weather . Then , that 's when they can blow . " Cave-ins too , " he added thoughtfully . " Yeah , I 've heard about some cave-ins . " James explained the work he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillars , " when the risk of a cave-in was worst . While the room was being mined , large square sections of coal , the pillars , were left to support the roof . Then when the mining of that room was completed , the pillars were " drawn , " removed for their coal content , and the roof began to " work , " settle downward with many ominous cracking and groaning sounds , still precariously held in place by whatever pillars had not yet been drawn and by wooden props . The roof , with all the weight above it , began to squeeze toward the floor , the " bottom , " James called it , and the strange groaning noises increased . This could go on for days as the pillars were drawn one by one . Experienced miners ? James said he was n't one of them ? could gauge by the increasing , restless , groaning noises at what pitch to withdraw and let the whole huge section of coal and slate collapse with a tremendous roar onto the bottom . Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't used to yet . This had been Lyle 's single firsthand experience of coal mining . He knew that if he went into the coal business , the world and the dangers of those miners ? and of James ? would never be his . But , he also knew that he was going to  | be aware for the rest of his life that this labyrinth of clammy menace underlay every limousine , tea dance and dividend in the world above . He decided to major in history at the university for the eminently practical reason that he had heard it was easy . At home in Middleburg his informal adviser in West Virginia history and southern history in general was Mrs. Ophelia McClellan Stallings , " Aunt Ophelia , " who lived in a small , white , resolutely Victorian house near the Castle with her virtually speechless husband , Clarence . Aunt Ophelia , no blood kin to the Catherwoods but an aunt by virtue of old family intimacy , was the lifelong , it seemed eternal , president of the local chapter of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cause of the South was equally lifelong , militant and ever vigilant . Now in her sixties , she discovered this new generation around her , Lyle 's , and set out to see that they were firmly and deeply indoctrinated into the glory of all that was the South . Clarkson Catherwood called her " the oldest southern belle still on her feet " and tried to avoid seeing her when , two days after Lyle 's visit to Mrs. Pence , Ophelia Stallings came to call at the Castle . She was already established in the front parlor , toque firmly planted on her head , pince-nez slightly atremble , when he and Lyle , returning from a round of golf , passed the door to that room and were firmly and with evident relief hailed by Minnie . " Come in , come in , " she cried . " Have some tea . Look who 's come to see us . Dear Ophelia . Never mind about your golf togs . Come in and have some tea . " Smiling , grinding their back teeth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comply . Clarkson had always acted , sometimes successfully , on the principle that the best defense against Ophelia was attack . " Tell me , Ophelia , " he began , stirring his tea importantly as he settled as far back as possible in an abrupt armchair , " I 've always been meaning to ask you and never have . McClellan , McClellan . That 's your maiden name , is n't it ? " " Yes , yes , it certainly is , " she replied in her somewhat hooting tone , a little muffled by false teeth and southern accent . " The McClellans , yes , Jefferson County , over on the Potomac . Of course the family originally came from Charleston . " " Oh is that so ! " exclaimed Lyle . " I was just down there . Gosh it gets hot . " " You were ... were you ... South Carolina , were you ? " " Oh I meant West Virginia . " A minute , complex series of tiny starts and tensions ricocheted through Mrs. Stallings 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all South Carolinians . Now Charleston , West Virginia , that 's a right charming little city , new . Do n't know much about it . " It was clear that Mrs. Stallings had adopted West Virginia and all that went with it , including the state capital at Charleston , but that her real loyalties , the bedrock , lay immovably in the oldest of the Old South . Since she lived her life in West Virginia she was devoting herself to establishing its southernness , but just as a baronet could never be compared to a duke in the aristocracy of England , to which she frequently harkened back through her lineage , so West Virginia could never be ranked with South Carolina . First things first . " What I was getting at , " resumed Clarkson agreeably , " was how your family connected up with General McClellan . " Ophelia swung her pince-nez to behold Clarkson . " General McClellan ! General McClellan ! That Yankee no-good mur-  | derer ! Why he 's no more kin to me than " ? " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling lips ? " than that cur there at your feet . " The " cur " was Cleo the collie , beloved by every soul in the Castle ; Ophelia sensed this , and referring to beloved Cleo as a cur was her revenge for the suggestion that the Yankee commander during the early part of the War Between the States could have had the remotest kinship connection with her and hers . She suddenly rounded on him again , the color rising beneath her powder . " Why Clarkson , I do believe you are pulling my leg . " Lyle started : pulling her leg ! Pretty racy language for Aunt Ophelia ; she was n't exactly Queen Victoria after all . He was beginning to see that there was always a trace of earthiness in these southern ladies : Puritanism was for New England . " You know no blood kin of mine , " she went on with spirit , " could have been a Yankee drummerboy , let alone commander . And what 's more , it was that show-off rascal McClellan that abducted these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroaded them into the Union . All illegal , unconstitutional , just tore them away from the mother state and thrust them at that grasping Mr. Lincoln in Washington . Why , these counties were as loyal to the South as . . . almost anyplace . Of course there was some Yankee sympathy here . There was Yankee sympathy in Georgia ! But that scamp McClellan came through here soon as war broke out , the Southern Army was over in the eastern part of the state , winning that great victory of Manassas , chasing those Yankees clear back to Washington City , and so McClellan had hardly any opposition here . He occupied these counties . It was a crime . Scandal . Treachery . " She fumbled in her purse for her inhaler , took a revivifying whiff . " I declare , there was nothing else like it in the War Between the States . How can this section ever have been Yankee ? Why Stonewall Jackson himself was born and grew up not twenty-five miles from here . Call that Yankee ! You  | think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Read your history . Nobody could go through Stonewall Jackson , everybody could stop McClellan . Trouble was , there was nobody here to do it . They were all over winning at Manassas . Do you recollect who commanded the Army of Virginia at that glorious victory at Manassas ? Do you ? Lyle ? " He rolled his eyes to the ceiling thoughtfully and then admitted he did n't . " Stonewall Jackson , of Harrison County , West . . . as it now is . . . Virginia , that 's who . So do n't start talkin ' to me about that . . . that buffoon McClellan , and do n't try to tell me these were Yankee counties . " After a courtly , unruffled silence to allow for the shock waves of this squall to subside , Clarkson said easily , " I take it you 're not related to him , Ophelia . " As her proud bosom , perfectly designed for ceremonial sashes , swelled preparatory to another foray at him Clarkson went on , smiling disarmingly across at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that joined West Virginia to the Union was born and raised even closer to where we are now than twenty-five miles ? about five minutes from here as the horse canters . " " Pierpont ! " she hooted . " There are opportunists and turncoats in every war . " " Most of the men from these counties served , I take it from my reading of history , in the Union Army , three to one , I seem to remember , Union over Confederate . " Ophelia was monumentally unimpressed . " Who do you think wrote those history books except dyed-in-the-wool Yankee Republican Easterners ? You think anybody believes those numbers ? Do you know when they did the countin ' ? Eighteen sixty-five , eighteen sixty-six , that 's when they did the countin ' . Well , what are people going to tell a Yankee Occupation administration around here , after Appomattox ? Lied like troopers , that 's what they did . All you 've got to do , if you were as old as I am , is remember what the men said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall which uniform they got out , when it was safe to get ' em out , to parade in , years after it was all over . Then you 'd see . We are the South here , sir . " Lyle almost exploded with amazed mirth at this totally unexpected " sir " ; it rang with the defiant pride of a plantation lady addressing marauding Yankee soldiers about to burn down the mansion . " And we must hand down that precious heritage to our children and never , never let it be diminished . You remember that , Lyle , you tell your children . " Of course , I have to say one thing . The slavery business , holding of slaves , that was wrong , an evil thing . There was twenty thousand of ' em in these counties when the war broke out . We had some , my people . We did n't approve of it . We did n't dare think of freeing any of them ? only had ten or twelve . The neighbors around us , well if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have done . So many people in the South never approved . . . Mr. Jefferson for one . " Well , the slaves did get freed , did n't they . The Yankee way . The Yankees just came in here and they destroyed slavery all right . And they destroyed our way of life too . And our property . And then they went away and the Negroes were free and poor as church mice with nobody to look after them and no plantation working anymore and no business operating and everybody in misery . That 's fixing things by war and violence for you . Men 's way . You men , " she snapped at Clarkson , " that 's the way you solve things . Send that McClellan to kidnap western Virginia at the point of a gun , end slavery at the point of a gun . " She drew a lace-fringed handkerchief from her purse and daubed experimentally at her lips with it . A faint perfume escaped from the purse ; Aunt Ophelia was all little handkerchiefs and little inhalers and vials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face powder . Having made this gesture to her femininity , she returned to the attack , head-on . " These miners , going to  | Logan with their guns . That man of yours ? what 's his name ? Claflin ? ? setting up his machine guns against them . " She nodded abstractedly to herself . The three Catherwoods , who had heretofore enjoyed and patronized dear , Confederate Aunt Ophelia , hawk-eyed old bird . His father 's baiting of her about General McClellan had released her . After all , she had lived from sometime in the 1850s until 1921 in a border state , struggling first through a Civil War and then through an Industrial Revolution . " You do n't think any of that shooting down in Logan is going to solve anything , do you ? " she finished . " They attacked us , " said Clarkson quietly . " What else could we do ? " " Hm . . . yes ... well ... yes . . . martial law . . . no free speech . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . well ... times are different , that they surely are , they surely are . " She blinked and smiled placatingly at the members of this important coal family . She retreated , as General Lee of sacred memory had so often done so effectively when necessary , drew back to the safety of her home territory , the War Between the States , after this tough little sally , just like one of Jeb Stuart 's , into the adversary 's camp . " You know what the most terrible year in the history of these counties was ? Do you , Lyle Boy ? " Lyle raised his eyebrows in perplexity and then blurted , " This year ? Nineteen twenty-one ? " " No . Certainly not . Of course not . What 's been goin ' on now , well , it does n't compare with the worst year . . . That year , Lyle Boy , was eighteen sixty-three . That prancing peacock McClellan came through here in eighteen sixty-one , and believe me by eighteen sixty-three there was n't a Yankee sympathizer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . . n : +wed  | an army from someplace else ? So everything just sort of collapsed . Confederate Irregular troops were operating right out of here in Middleburg . There was n't . . . well there just was n't any government . Houses got burned down , livestock run off , somebody waylaid the sheriff and took all his clothes away . Brother against brother . Violence . No rhyme and no reason . " She paused . " I remember it , a little , over in my county . We buried the silver and everything valuable back near the grape arbor . I can remember my mama taking me over to sit down in the window seat and saying , Now remember , Ophelia Jane , when any strange men come here , if they should ask about the silver and any other valuable things ? you remember my necklace you liked to touch ? ? things like that , we sold them . Now you remember that , hear ? We sold them . Had to , because of the war . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Yes 'm , ' I said . And there were some bands of men came through , several times . They never found what we 'd buried . I reckon , " she added dryly , " that 's why one band burned the barn , and another band burned down the house . " She pronounced this last word as if it were " hose . " " I was so scared , little bitty girl , and it just seemed like the world was coming to an end . Next thing I expected was an earthquake , or the Devil coming up out of our well ! And to tell the truth of it the world was coming to an end , our world , it was coming to an end and nothing ever could bring it back . Not even prosperity . This . . . all this , all this here , the .. . you . . . what I mean , we all do admire the Cliftons and their lovely homes so very much , but , what I mean is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing at all . We were secure , thought we were , sitting on our own land , our crops , our food , our people . Each plantation and farm was like a little world of its own . Did n't depend on selling coal to New York , or labor unions , things like that . That made us feel . . .  | easy , safe . And now , my stars , nothing 's safe in West Virginia , and it never has been since that monster McClellan came through here with his guns . " Ophelia McClellan Stallings took another sniff from her inhaler . " We had what you might call gentlefolk here in those days . And now , well , what we have here . . . what we seem to have here " ? an apologetic , forewarning little cough ? " buccaneers . " She tittered in a way that sounded faintly hysterical around the edges . " Forgive me , Clarkson , dear . Do n't know what 's got into me today . Been having palpitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Minnie , who had been a study in pastels , lounging back in a Victorian settee , leaned intently forward . " Ophelia , dear , Clarkson is n't offended . Nobody is offended , " she spoke with a subdued emphasis , " when they 're hearing the truth , not if they 're honest . " Clarkson stared noncommittally into space . " You know that I 've been trying to improve things around Bennettown and some of Clarkson 's other towns for years . Oh in little ways , playgrounds , milk . My dear , you ca n't imagine the opposition , ostracism almost , I 've met with . What do you mean going down there , a lady like you ? ' Thelma Hayes says that to me every three months or so . The other ladies over at the church , the ones with men in coal at least , think I 'm the most interfering , bohemian , Bolshevik maybe , that ever was . But what do you do down there ? ' they keep asking me , screwing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I try to help out a little , ' I tell them . But the churches have missions down in the mining camps . ' It 's always down ' in the mining camps , never over ' or God forbid up . " You do n't belong there , ' they say , and they 're really puzzled , indignant in fact . My husband owns the company , ' I say . But what 's that got to do with it ! That does n't give you the right to interfere in something that does n't concern you . " But it does concern me , ' I tell them . I 'm con-  | cerned because those people are so poor and have so little and we have so much . ' That really riles them up . But that 's the way it 's supposed to be ! Anything else is union radical talk , Bolshevism . It could destroy this industry , it could destroy us , our homes , our children . You are a dangerous woman and you do n't even know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just think it 's dangerous not to do anything : No it 's not , ' they say , because this is the way it 's always been : " " Fiddlesticks ! " exclaimed Ophelia . " That 's the way it 's been for the last thirty years , that 's all . It 's piracy , " she repeated , seized in spite of her manners by her vision . " You 're trapped in it , we all are , here on top , in Middleburg . We 've seized the wealth , you know , and now we have to fight to keep it . I say we ' ; Clarence 's practice is all based on coal operators . We do n't know anything else to do , do we , up here on top ? We fight for every dollar we 've won . It 's all so big now , so expanded . We have to hold on to our big profits , otherwise . . . " And she left that sentence unfinished . Otherwise , Lyle finished it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a living . . . and what can I do ? Otherwise , finished Minnie , these walls will begin to crumble and Lyle will have to face a hostile world , and I .. . somehow I will be ? oh ? overwhelmed . Because I will have so dismally failed . I saw the injustice . I knew it had to be redressed somehow . But I could not do it , because I was too weak , too . . . too feminine . Too neurasthenic , too much a meek little convent-bred lady in her Castle . Otherwise , Clarkson reflected , everything I 've devoted my life to will vanish . But it wo n't . I wo n't let that happen . I will not . Because if I did , then I would just amount to nothing . Nothing at all . Not exist . Minnie and I would both wind up in Weston . 159  | Ever since his experience with the Armed March , since coming through the battle lines with Bull , since the impossible instant when he saw blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's acceptance of what she saw as her share of guilt in Virgil 's death , Lyle had been pondering what had risen in his mind as a result of this sequence : the essential selfishness of , it seemed , everyone . Having reached this conclusion , he began to feel somewhat cheered about himself . God knew he was selfish ! He wanted spiffy clothes and a swell car , a top girl ; he rarely passed a mirror without sneaking at least a glance at himself , half in admiration half in critical appraisal , but all directed at and concerned with himself . He wondered about and dreamed about his future all the time : his future . What little time remained from all those self-preoccupations was devoted to shooting pool , going to the picture shows , parties , running Cleo the collie , sneaking Canadian whiskey , playing golf , driving his car fast , sleeping , masturbation , flirting , and evading feelings of guilt as much as he could . And now this last preoccupation was perceptibly lighter . Everyone was preoccupied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was preoccupied with his or her self . School days , school days . How glad he would be when they were over , and nobody would bother him with things like grammar again . What had the Armed March been but a bunch of miners determined to have their way , their way , by any and every means ? And what had Don Chafin 's defense been but the mine owners determined to keep what they had , they had , by any and every means ? And what had Aunt Ophelia been talking about but the South fighting to preserve its way of life , its way of life , and the North determined to change that into their way of life .  | It was all willful self-interest ? me , me , me ? I want mine . It was , Lyle reflected wryly  --  - another pristine thought ? all pretty crude and unattractive and basically uncivilized and certainly un-Christian in any sense of that word which he understood . But even in Christianity there was the Golden Rule : Do unto others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And : Love thy neighbor as thyself . As thyself . Love thyself . Christ , even Christ was selfish ! Lyle was beginning to get an inkling , more than an inkling , of something behind all his feelings , some assumption he had about himself that had always been a terrible liability to him . It was some feeling he had . It was why he drank , why he traipsed after rebelling miners , made asinine remarks , argued with girls at parties . But what was it exactly ? He could n't put his finger on it . But it was all around him , it was as though it was his skin , so much a part of him that he could n't really feel it . I know what I will do , he resolved . I am going to change myself . Anybody can do that if he makes his mind up to it . I am going to become different and be a big improvement everywhere . And I am going to be unselfish , completely unselfish . Maybe then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not particularly selfish ? lying in that curve of that path , the shocking pallor coming into his face , the terrible fount of blood , the sickening realization that Virgil would never have been on that path except that Lyle Catherwood had wanted to show off , be somebody at any cost  --  - maybe that vision would fade . He was going to be completely different now , and the first place in which to turn over his new leaf would be with his studies . Lyle began spending much more time at the university in Morgantown . He exercised in the gym . He threw out the  | cache of whiskey , both in Morgantown and at home , and broke off relations with his bootlegger . He gave up poker ; at night he tended to be in bed by ten o'clock . He even began doing his academic homework . Weekends were spent at Morgantown , often working in the library or else running around the track . Varsity football was too overwhelmingly important at the university to be ignored , and Lyle like everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not at all a dissipation or an act of selfishness , but instead as a ritual of almost religious seriousness . The Mountaineers of West Virginia were a football team to reckon with on a national scale . Seated in the cheering section at Mountaineer Field , a steep , U-shaped concrete stadium overlooking the Monongahela River , he was swept away by the sheer magnitude of it all , the glorious completed passes and long runs , the tragic fumbles , the appalling interceptions , the unforgettable victories . It was the most inspiring drama taking place in West Virginia as the twenties went forward , a field of epic struggle where , if he had been good enough , he would have played alongside miners ' sons on football scholarships from Bennettown or Monongah or Logan ; here equality was truly enforced , or rather , preeminence went to those with the most strength , skill , and dedication , with no reference at all as to who Daddy was or what kind of house you lived in , or even what brand of English you spoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these heroes were made and occasionally , heartbreakingly , unmade , Saturday after Saturday . Lyle watched , taut with excitement and involvement , as other young men , just his age , some of them friends , solved their problem of being someone , getting the limelight , becoming a star . Well he himself had put all of that , at least the selfish part of it , behind him , and now he was determined to be good , syrupy sentimental churchy word though it might be . He  | would never to save his life have confessed such a nunlike ambition to another living soul , but in the innermost chamber of his own thoughts this was uppermost . He had to be good , very good indeed now , because he sensed with deep uneasiness that if he was not good now some kind of baleful , very peculiar , and extremely unhappy future awaited him . He was eighteen years old , rich and indulged ; this was the Jazz Age , in the midst of the greatest boom the Middleburg field had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Morgantown for the football game . He had lunch with Lyle at the fraternity house and then they walked to the football field under gold-leafed trees , an autumnal wind flirting with their overcoats and hats . Lyle felt a throatcatching excitement rising from people hurrying by , and the echoing uproar rising out of the stadium . Utterly unannounced , Virgil Pence 's face flashed vividly before Lyle 's mind 's eye . I 've got to say something to my father about him , he thought automatically . " Dad , uh , whatever happened about Virgil Pence and you know his pension and insurance and things like that ? " After a pause his father replied , " I 've investigated it . His widow will have an income from insurance . " " How big ? " " Ah ? modest . " " Modest ? Real modest ? " " Modest . Quite modest . " " Does he get a pension from us ? " " There was no provision for that when he was hired . " " Yes , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am going to make some kind of settlement . " " What kind ? " Another pause and then Clarkson said a little testily , " Leave this matter to me . " But I ca n't leave it to you , Lyle wanted to shout . I 've always left everything to you , and this time I ca n't because you are n't responsible and I am . And where will I be if I always leave everything to you ! Apparently sensing Lyle 's continuing uneasiness Clarkson added , " We can discuss it later if you like . " " We have to , somebody has to , because she 's got a young kid , and well , somebody has to keep them out of the poor-house ! " Clarkson gave him a dry , sidelong glance . " Do n't overdramatize things , son . Things do n't usually work out as badly as all that . Or as well as we like to hope . Mrs. Pence will be all right . She 's a young woman , an attractive young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some other young fellow will provide for her and that child . " Lyle was startled . Remarry : he 'd never somehow thought of that . How . . . well , ordinary of her ! What a run-of-the-mill undercutting of the whole tragic drama . Remarry ! And devoted Virgil barely interred . That child growing up with some other father ? It did n't seem decent somehow ; it was n't fitting . All the drama would drain out of it , his role , hers , the Armed Marchers ' , Sheriff Chafin 's , his father 's . Remarry ? Striding along beside his father in the exhilarating , balmy gusts of October 's breezes toward Mountaineer Field , amid the expectant hubbub of the dressy , game-going crowd , Lyle experienced an odd visceral flash : he could n't name it , yet . They entered the ramp leading beneath the stands to their seats . " Great day for a game ! " somebody called across the throng to Clarkson . " We goin ' to take ' em ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Are you bettin ' we are ? " the other called out in an almost challenging voice . " Sure am . " " Well then , me too . If Clarkson Catherwood puts his money on something , that sure is good enough for me ! " West Virginia did win that afternoon , and the man who had followed Clarkson 's advice , " Moon " Mulvihill , a coal operator from Charleston , ran into them again on the way out and collared Clarkson for a quick business discussion . It took place in the back seat of the parked Packard , and Lyle waited in the front seat with George , a pane of glass separating them from the conferees in back . It always seemed to be like that for Lyle , when his father and business were concerned . He could see it all transpiring , the mysteries of his father 's wide-ranging and consistently successful dealings , but he himself seemed consigned to a soundproof compartment with the servants . In the back seat , whatever secret abilities and prophetic knowledge his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this man , this " Moon " Mulvihill , a dirt farmer turned strip miner turned millionaire , would follow it , just as he had followed Clarkson Catherwood 's football advice , and prosper some more . It all seemed to go past him somehow , past Lyle , over his shoulder , behind his back , ungraspable , not quite overheard , elusive as ground fog . He would never learn the mystery , the secrets , the techniques and prophecies himself . He felt he would n't . He suspected that it was as beyond him as scoring that spectacular touchdown at Mountaineer Field this afternoon . What could be surer proof of that than his father 's never really trying to explain any of it to him , retreating always behind a pane of glass for his conferences , leaving him at Charleston with orders to go home to Middleburg while he himself pressed on to the crucial Logan with Virgil Pence ? His father was undoubtedly a brilliant businessman , every-  | body knew that , and if his father did n't see the beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't there . They just were n't there to develop . And that was that . His spirits were now very low , all the buoyancy of the exuberant October football afternoon shriveling with the long shadows of approaching dusk , a gray-turning day in glum , steep-hilled Morgantown , its waste-discolored river , its scarred hills . Lyle got out of the car , bidding George , Mr. Mulvihill and his father good-bye , and trailed back to the fraternity house . Coming through the door into the front hall the first person he encountered was Fanny Carstairs , wearing some kind of a gold-colored , metallic dress through which a good display of her legs slithered in and out as she danced . " Golly , I 'm tuckered out ! " she exclaimed to her partner . " Lyle Catherwood . You always have refreshments on you . Give me some refreshment . " Cursing himself for having done away with his supply of Canadian whiskey , Lyle scouted about the fraternity house and managed to buy a bottle of some clear fluid which , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fanny and he then procured a can of fruit juice in the kitchen , mixed it with the colorless liquid , and began to regale themselves with the result in an alcove in the back hall . They offered samples of it to passing couples and were rewarded with gulps of what the passing couples had to offer . Lyle was finding Fanny much more fun than she usually was with him . Perhaps taking her to the meeting of the United Mine Workers had made him more interesting to her . She let him kiss her a couple of times , although she would laugh and say , " Now Lyle , do n't think anything means anything ! " He wondered whether , if she drank some more of this heady mixture , she might not find herself taking him seriously , if only for a couple of hours . How far , as the classic question went , would she then be willing to go ? What did  | she look like with no clothes on , he speculated , conjuring up an irresistible shapeliness which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had on , not a great deal of imagination was needed . Later on they were dancing in the crowded front room . His head seemed to be in some way detached from his body and Fanny Carstairs seemed to be conveying to him , by her swaying skirt and rumpled hair and the heat of her body , that she was ready for him , this once anyway , to move his hands and his mouth over her in a way that would have been unthinkable before . He maneuvered her into the little back den , closed the door and turned the key , and putting his arms around her began to nibble her ear and then moved his mouth down her neck toward her bosom . His left hand began to go up her leg and then there was a resounding slap across his face and her furious eyes were burning at him . " You sneak ! Who do you think you are . Who do you think I am ! Giving me that rotten whiskey and then trying ? Let me out of here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Oh hell , oh damn . Oh how he had bungled that ! Too fast , too much , not allowing for the fact that she was four years older and innately convinced of her Clifton superiority which amounted , when it came to him at least , to untouchability . He was stunned and ashamed and indignant all at once from the arrogant , unpredictable suddenness of her repulse . Why could n't she have said , " No , Lyle , please , stop that . " Fanny Clifton Carstairs could n't be bothered with such a modulation . Suddenly displeased , she let him have it right between the eyes . That was her way . Why should she be bothered with any other ? After all , look at who she was . Well , then , he thought to himself , taking another gulp of the concoction , to hell with her . He ran into Pete Hayes and some other friends and they had concoctions of their own which he was encouraged to  | sample generously . Then there seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampled , and then Pete Hayes said they should all now drive to Middleburg and go swimming in the indoor Clifton pool . If the Cliftons would n't let them in , then they would go in the Catherwood plunge . Lyle agreed hilariously to that . How he would drag this crowd and himself in the state they were in past his parents , past Tot for that matter , was a question which did n't penetrate his mind . Driving to Middleburg seemed the logical next move to everyone , and they all got into their cars . No one would ride with Lyle , but that did n't bother him particularly now . Four cars headed out of town on the road to Middleburg , Pete Hayes leading in his Chevrolet roadster , Lyle behind him in his Stutz , and two other cars , crowded sedans , following . It was all original and fun and spontaneous , hurtling along the twisting road in the dark , the night air rushing through Lyle 's open car . Then there was a curve and somehow the steering wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunk spread itself hugely in his headlights , he swerved , the right side of the car slammed against the tree , rebounded off it , and Lyle was catapulted into the air . When he came to himself he was lying on the ground and some of the fraternity boys and their girl friends were shining a light in his face . Somebody was feeling along his legs . This examination and Lyle 's own established that he was not injured physically . Somebody mentioned the possibility of at least a mild brain concussion , but Lyle said his brain was perfectly clear . Then he said it again . The car had gone down an embankment , turning over several times , and would not be worth anything anymore . So Lyle got into a sedan and asked to be let off at one of the speakeasies on River Street . A couple of the others suggested it might be better for him to go home , but he said he  | was fine . So they let him off at the Blue Hawaii bar . He was known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark room , there was jazz playing somewhere , the lights were reddish , dim . He supposed he looked pretty battered , but it was too dim for people to see that . He had a couple of drinks and then a girl who said her name was Theda joined him and they danced a little . Then they went up to Theda 's room a few doors away . There she agreed for forty-five dollars to get into bed with him naked . Her body was not unlike what he imagined Fanny 's to be . Perhaps because of that he could n't manage to get sexually excited . Theda tried a couple of tricks but nothing worked , and finally she grew tired of it , she already had his forty-five dollars , and she just laughed briefly and said , " Little man , you are n't there tonight . Better go home to , you know , mother , do n't you think ? " But in the end , for another thirty dollars , she agreed to let him sleep there the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shortly after dawn Lyle woke up in this flimsy little room hanging over the edge of the river . The Monongahela slid by , smoky green , beneath the window , and it seemed that if it rose a few feet it would seize this rickety little room and take it swirling upstream toward Pittsburgh . He opened the window wider , urgently needing air , and the damp cool river air came up to him , evoking movement , travel , escape . Gulping this unsettling air , Lyle turned back to the room . It was pinkish ? a pink silk bedspread , pink feathers adorning a kind of canopy , white-furred bedroom slippers , mirrors . His single thought was escape . He looked into the mirror . An almost unrecognizable young derelict looked back at him . Swiftly turning away , he saw to his enormous relief that there was a telephone , and succeeded in getting Pete Hayes , in his home at the other end of Middleburg , on the line . Pete agreed to pick him up ; then they would drive  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notify the State Police about Lyle 's accident . They wanted to talk to Lyle . Later , he thought exhaustedly , later . A half hour later Pete pulled up in the Chevrolet roadster and Lyle stumbled into it . " You look as wrecked as your car , " was Pete 's first reaction . " I 'm worse . Let 's go down to Morgantown . God forbid anybody here would see me . Drive carefully . " " How was she ? " " Who ? " " Whoever you spent the night with . " " The top , " he said , " the winner . " " You mean it ? " " No , I do n't mean it . " Through a crisp , bright , idealistic early morning , all fresh sunshine and pure air , they drove down the tortuous road . Pete stopped his car beside the big tree with the bruised trunk and they got out and looked down at the crumpled Stutz . It somehow made Lyle think of his own boyhood , or youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , he went down to extract the registration and insurance policy from the car , and then without a backward glance climbed back up the embankment . It seemed to him that a door , the one opening on a room known as Good Clean Fun , was closing in his life . Back in Morgantown , Lyle was sitting in the broken armchair in his chaotic room in the fraternity house . Suddenly he felt an odd , elemental shaking sensation along his spine . He knew he was not moving physically at all ; his innards  | seemed to be trembling , his liver , his gut , his essence . It was not something rising out of his brain , his thoughts , his memory , even his remorse . It was the snub-nosed elemental animal at the core , the he-beast : it was in terror , blind . It wanted out , out ! It was as though , Lyle realized in a kind of fatalistic amazed horror , there was this elemental animal inside , his primitive self , and this animal realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to crash , wreak destruction upon himself . It desperately wanted out , wanted to save itself . Even my own inside self , Lyle reflected with quiet horror , wishes to abandon me . I 'm going to faint , he thought . No , I ca n't faint , what a pantywaist thing to do ! Get a grip on yourself , old man , get a grip on yourself . He was certainly going to have to do something . If only he were religious , like his mother . His mother : well , she was his mother and she was religious and maybe she could help him somehow . Someone was going to have to , and very soon , or else , he did n't know ... So this was why , this was how people threw themselves off bridges . Lyle went to the bathroom to shave . He looked at himself in the mirror . Pale blue eyes , uncertain expression , bloodshot . Reddish , freckled skin , but pale underneath , sallow , as though he was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Unkempt red hair going in all directions . A derelict 's stubble of beard . He took a bath , brushed his hair , dressed himself in gray flannel pants , a striped shirt , and a thick white sweater . Collegiate . Then he reconsulted the mirror . Everything looked good , a healthy normal American college student , right up to the eyes . The illusion stopped there . He went out , borrowed Pete Hayes 's car , and set off toward Middleburg . One characteristic of West Virginia invariably noticed by daunted visitors was the quality of its roads . They were like no others in the country , with the possible exception of those  | in eastern Kentucky , eastern Tennessee , and Arkansas . They were everywhere recognized as breathtaking . The whole state was a panorama of irregular hills , upthrusting mountains , high-walled rivers . In addition to these natural disadvantages for roadbuilding , it was , despite the enormous coal boom , a poor state . Taxes were very low . Its governors , highway commissioners , and other key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money finally trickled down for the actual construction of roads was nowhere adequate to cope with the challenging geographic conditions . Bricks had been patted into place side by side in earlier years to provide bizarre versions of the Wizard of 0z 's Yellow Brick Road leading from place to place , with appropriately witty results . Lately , macadam had come into style , but the necessary grading and subsurface reinforcement was generally dispensed with , so that the hot tar dripped along ridges and through valleys provided only , when it hardened , a surface soon cracked and potholed as the road made its way , leaning dangerously along the flank of some mountain or , in the case of Morgantown to Middleburg , the edge of a cliff above the Monongahela River . Lyle sped along this road , taking the numerous bumps , the inversely banked turns , the steep grades , as they came . From long experience , and as a game with himself and with others who covered this road as often as he did , he tried to maintain an average of forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-five miles an hour on this road , but Pete Hayes had sustained a concussion of the brain from flying off it at one of its special curves . This damn state does n't want to be modern , thought Lyle . Everything here is against it . We all ought to be Indians or something . The swift rivers were great for canoes , the mountain trails had been passable enough on horseback . He drove his car forcefully along the last bumpy patch and into Middleburg , over the bridge , through the busy little  | center of town and out gracious , tree-lined Middleburg Ave. - nue . The trees had all turned russet and red and gold and brown , and a late October wind made them wave ? drunkenly it seemed to Lyle 's eyes ? alongside the fine solid brick homes and the complicated turn-of-the-century big wooden ones with their little turrets and stained-glass windows and glassed-in porches . The City of a Hundred Millionaires , so they said , and maybe it was true . Porte cocheres and Packards , four-square mansions with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little white charges a stroll , the streetcar screeching importantly up the center of the avenue , and overall the splendid trees , manycolored and swaying , shed an atmosphere of shelter and permanence and solidity . There was no trace of a coal mine or coal miner . This was the county seat and the industrial headquarters . Here lived the shopkeepers and the professional people and the gentry and , as they were called elsewhere but never here ? an unpretentious sense of the ridiculous being too highly developed in this society ? the coal barons . Lyle swung the Chevrolet roadster through the open , wrought-iron gates of the Castle , up the driveway , and stopped with a screech under the porte cochere . The solid gray crenellated Castle was beginning to acquire an illusion of age , with ivy creeping up its walls , the rhododendron and other shrubbery crowding its foundations , and the thick lawns sweeping away from it . Inside , in the octagonal hall , Lyle breathed deeply the characteristic odor of wax , fireplaces , and flowers . It would forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be encountered in any other edifice in the world : wax ; fireplaces , lately burning , waiting ashes soon to be rekindled ; flowers , the fresh perfume from the soil , just cut from the flower beds and the hothouse . Aunt Tot appeared through the kitchen hall door and told  | him that his mother was in her sewing room in the tower . He mounted the curving stairway to the gallery above , and then the narrower flights two stories higher , emerging at the doorway to her sewing room . Minnie was wearing a long , gray silk dress , ruffled at the neck and wrists , with skirts overlaying each other at different lengths down to the ankles . Lyle complimented her on it . " It 's what 's called a tiered skirt , dear . I 'm so glad you like it . It 's awfully dressy to be wearing at home while you sew , but today when I was getting dressed something just said to me , Put on something pretty , Minnie , somebody special may just drop in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie turned away from her sewing machine . " Sit over there in the rocker by the window . You 're looking well . But what 's wrong with your eyes ? " Lyle brushed his hand over them and shook his head impatiently . " I have a little cold . " Then he thought better of that lie . " Well , I guess I do n't have a cold . I ? ah ? I 'm not feeling so well . I want to . . . I 'd like to . . . well , talk to you about something . " " Good . Let 's go downstairs and get some tea . " Lyle looked quickly about him . " Ca n't they bring it up here ? I like it better up here . " Up here was his mother 's domain ; downstairs , with its focus on the library , was his father 's . She gazed openly at him for a moment and then said , " Sure they can . The button 's there on the wall . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said appraisingly . " Naw . " He leaned forward , forearms on knees , punching one palm with the other fist . " I 'm in a mess , Ma . " Noting her look of alarm he added quickly , " Oh I do n't mean with the cops or with a . . . a . . . young lady or anything like that . I mean . . . just inside my head . " " Those are the worst kind , " she murmured . C 174 J  | " And also inside my , I do n't know how to explain it , belly , my gut , it 's as though . . . well ... as though something is trying to ... to tear me apart . " Minnie was frowning and nodding , a small troubled smile on her face . " We 'll have to talk , " she said , " Let 's wait till we get the tea things . " A few moments later there was a tap on the door . It was Thomasina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Thomasina . Ask Tot for a couple of slices of that angel food cake she was baking . " Thomasina withdrew . " Where 's that old Reverend Roanoke ? " blurted Lyle . " You remember him ? Is n't that something ! Why , he has n't been around here in ten years . More . " " I know . Where is he ? " " What makes you think I know where he is ? " asked Minnie , a cagey , playful look in her eyes . " But you do , do n't you . " She adjusted something in the sewing machine and then said a shade defiantly , " Yes . I do . " " You hear from him , do n't you . " " That 's right . " " I do n't care if Dad does n't approve . " " My religion 's a private ? " " Sure . I approve . " " Do you ? " she asked a touch patronizingly . " Yes . I approve of anything , and anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yourself from them . " Minnie turned in her chair to face Lyle . " I correspond with Reverend Roanoke . Do n't need to so much , because he 's already given me ? gave it to me years ago ? that help you 're talking about . " " What did he do ? " asked Lyle evenly , with quiet emphasis . " He discovered , " said Minnie , a luminous smile beginning to emerge shyly on her face , " that I was ? Saved ! Maybe you want to hear about it . But let 's wait till they bring the tea . " 175J  | Lyle leaned back in the rocker and contemplated this room with a sense of momentary inner peace , its curving exterior wall with the big bay window , its high white interior walls , dark , polished floor , its smallness , the high ceiling , all of it clean as a needle . There were footsteps in the hallway and then Thomasina followed by George brought in tea and food . " Awful long way to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy here wanted to have tea with his mama in the tower ! " The servants nodded and went out , and Lyle fell upon the sandwiches and cake . One thing he 'd forgotten to do for a while was eat . He took some tea . It was very refreshing and even a little invigorating . For the first time he realized why English people , men as well as women , made such a fuss about it . When he paused for air and had time to speak he said , " Well , if you 're saved I guess it does n't have to mean your children are . " " What it is , Lyle , what is it ? " He ducked his head , nodding . Then he said , " I 'm sunk , Ma , I ca n't make any sense out of myself . " " It 's that poor Pence man you mean ? " " That , and all the shooting down at Logan , and I do n't know anything about the coal business and Pa knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never know how to deal with those fellows . But then I do n't understand the management part either and I do n't think I ever will , Pa knows that , I can tell he 's just made up his mind I 'll never be able to work in the Clarkson Coal Company in any important capacity , let alone run it . And so just what in blazes am I going to do ? How do I fit in ? " He started , bitterly enraged at himself ? everything he did made matters worse ? to cry a little just for a moment . " Oh Lylie , oh my Lyle , come over here ... that 's it .. . now , now ... now . . . now . That 's it , sit back down , have  | some more tea . That 's it . Now then , now . " She sat back in her straight-backed work chair and took a few deep breaths . " You know , I sit up here a lot . A lot , by myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to think up here . Do n't get restive , son , I 'm coming to right what you 're talking about . " The light from the window caught her blue eyes and Lyle was once again struck by how idealistic they were . She 's never compromised , he suddenly thought . Somehow she 's never given up on her principles . " Do n't you know what 's wrong ? " she asked . " Well , I do n't either entirely , but there 's one thing that 's got us all confused in this family . . . and in this town . . . in this state . It 's the coal boom ! " She drew a long breath . " It 's . . . it 's almost too much for us . It 's really , you may not believe this , almost too much for your father . It 's all too sudden , too recent , too much . These men here , Clarkson , the Cliftons , they 're all suffering from what you might call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a responsibility . Think of the envy . Other people who want some of all this gold , and then all the conflict , the confusion , all the passion that gets stirred up here in this little backwater , this little hill country , West Virginia . Goodness , there was hardly anything here before , simple farmers , hunting , nothing else except in a few counties along the Virginia border where there was some plantation life . And then ! My glory , the whole country depending on our coal ! President Harding getting all het up in the White House if there 's trouble in the coalfields down here ! " She pinched the bridge of her nose , grimacing slightly . " All this thrust on some nice boys from the hills ? Marcus Clifton , your father , Fred Hayes ? who were . . . well they were just like you , or just like what you would have been if you 'd grown up in a plain clapboard house instead of in this , well , silly Castle . Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even younger than our years , at the time we had it built . And look at Clifton Manor ! Houses like that were 0177 1  | built for dukes ! Back in Queen Elizabeth 's time , three hundred years ago ! So what does Sanderson Clifton do with his first two million dollars ? Builds one of these mansions , only more solid , better , in Middleburg , West Virginia , in nineteen hundred and six ! You 're just like them , Lylie , the only difference is that this whole huge thing , the boom , the houses , all those miners , you grew up right in the middle of all that , you do n't remember anything else . They grew up alongside it , if you see what I mean , so it did n't intimidate them so much . They saw it grow . You only see this huge thing , already there . It does n't intimidate them so much , only now , now I think it 's beginning to , I think it is . Every time they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since nineteen sixteen , it 's as though they 're cowboys trying to break a horse . The horses are getting wilder , and the cowboys are getting older . " She poured them each some more tea ; Lyle thought of his cache of whiskey , destroyed , which had been hidden in his bedroom . How badly were his nerves asking for a drink ? " You know , " she went on , sipping cogitatively from time to time , " the Catherwood family was n't anything special until this generation . Your Granddaddy Catherwood , remember him ? " " Not very well . " " Had that farm over near Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley . Ophelia once asked your father about what she I called the Catherwood Plantation your people had over in the valley . ' Your father said , Well , if that was a plantation then I was a field hand . I did the apple-picking and fed the hogs . ' It was a farm , a prosperous farm most years . He got to go J to the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , you never knew him , left him these lands here and Clarkson came to see and there was coal everywhere under them and the boom was starting up and here we are ! Here we are , and here I am . My people were just nice respectable Baltimore people . We did n't know the what you might call II  | high society people in Baltimore . We were n't like that , did n't live that way , did n't have a lot of money , were n't what they called old family . ' Believe me , I had to learn a lot when I found I was the mistress of this place with seven servants and trips to Europe first class . We all had to learn , the Cliftons and all of us . Entertaining President Taft . Well , basically what we did was just to stay ourselves although we had a lot of fancy , expensive accoutrements ? " " What are they ? " " Fancy things . Limousines and jewelry and furs . We took to it all ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't turn our heads , none of it did , until now . " She began slowly to twist her engagement ring and wedding band . " Now it 's all getting so unsettled . Your father never talks about business to me , might as well discuss it with Cleo , but I hear his voice on the telephone and I see it in his hands , the way he uses them now , kind of nervously , hesitant sometimes . Marcus Clifton reminds me of a man doing a great juggling act and everyone is amazed and applauding and he has a kind of . . . astonished air to him , very keyed up and excited and pleased and somewhere , somehow , scared to death ! It 's all so big and so sudden ! So . . . no wonder you should feel disturbed ... sensitive ... you 're like your mama in that . " " Well there 's all that , I guess , " Lyle said , his hands clenched between his knees , " and I know the Armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ah , death stirred me up and all , but it 's more . More . It 's . . . who am I ? It 's got something to do with faith . Faith in something . Faith . " Lyle had never opened himself to his mother in this way since he was a little boy and afraid of the dark , but she ' was not surprised . She was aware that he must have been shaken , threatened to the core of himself to come to her in this way , but she knew that deep perturbation , was unsurprised by it .  | " I think , Lyle dear , that I 'm going to ask Reverend Roanoke to come up from Arkansas and pay us a visit . " Lyle sat motionless and wordless , not knowing what to think . " I do wish , " Minnie went on with a little smile , " that you had been old enough to go with us when your father and I took that tour of the Mediterranean . It was just fascinating and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now do n't fidget , I 'm not changing the subject from what we 've been talking about . You 'll see . " We arrived in the Bay of Naples ? this was in nineteen hundred and seven ? we arrived aboard a yacht ! It belonged to an English nobleman named Lord Carven of Medford . He had mining interests in Great Britain and he and Clarkson were deep into some kind of negotiations . In fact , now that I think of it , Lord Carven was and I think probably still is some kind of a partner of your father 's , in his Logan holdings . " Lyle 's mind flashed from the image of a long , white steam yacht gliding into the Bay of Naples to the main street of Logan , as seen from a window of the Aracoma Hotel . " The yacht was called the Osiris . It ? she ' they told me to call it , one of the many things I learned ? she , the yacht , was all teakwood and leather , and it had wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wineglasses , plates , salt and pepper , everything , all shining fittings , so that nothing would slide out of its place when the ship rolled . There was even a kind of box you could sit in and have a steam bath ! Lord and Lady Carven had a masseur they took with them everywhere . They were very strenuous people , much too much for me , certainly in those days when my health . . . was n't the best . They both rode horseback a great deal , they hunted , and they even rode on skis ! In Switzerland , a village there , Saint something . Ice-skated . Tobogganed . He loved  | to shoot , of course , but then so did she ! So they were in constant need of massages and steam baths . " " Mother ? " " I 'm getting to the point , Lyle dear . It 's just that in getting there it brings back that extraordinary trip , that world . They went plunging , right into the sea , wherever we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibraltar . Nothing daunted her , Lady Carven . I was envious , so envious . I believe watching her planted something in me , some urge so terrible that I had to fight my way back , as I did two years later . . . " A tiny sigh of relief , " the Reverend " she murmured to herself . Then , laughing suddenly and irrepressibly , Minnie cried , " I declare I know I 'm getting you all riled up , Lylie , but I am going to come to the point . " " Mother , I 'm not in any hurry . " " Good . Finish the cake . So . Where was I ? Oh yes , we landed in Naples and the first thing Lord and Lady Carven insisted on doing was hiring donkeys , for the four of us and also a guide , and ride to the very top rim of the volcano of Vesuvius ! It was the only way to reach it , on donkeys . Maybe it still is . Why anyone would want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carven was such that I simply forced myself to go . Clarkson was against it , but I insisted and in the end , wearing a big sun hat and carrying a parasol , I got onto this strange little beast and began what turned out to be a really endless climb . At least the animal was docile ! I 've never been afraid of animals , you know , just , in those days , I was afraid of exertion ! My doctors were afraid of it for me . That was half my trouble . Well , up the side of Vesuvius we toiled and I do n't know .. hours later , we did finally come up to the rim of the crater and look in . " Now I know what hell is . " Then her voice drifted off again for a moment . " I shall never see it , thank the Lord . A strange , horrible crust was on the floor of this . . . what they  | called the Fire Pit , and there was a place where the lava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hellish , it was just terrifying . The Carvens said , It 's worth coming up to see , is n't it ? ' and that was all they had to say . I had never made such a physical exertion in my life and I had never seen anything so terrible . " It turned out that there was a second yacht , even grander than the grand one we were on , somewhere in the area . Now , as we were coming down the mountain ? I felt such a relief , such a sense of accomplishment . You know , once you reach a difficult goal , it 's so much easier coming back , a lark . As we were coming down the trail we saw a party mounting it , two ladies , with some attendants . Very impressive ladies ? huge hats , veils , parasols ? and as we got close I saw that one looked quite beautiful and the other perhaps less beautiful but very striking . Then Lord and Lady Carven began to bow , as low as they possibly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ladies nodded and smiled and passed on . One was really lovely , no longer young , but still very beautiful . Do you know who that was ? It was the Queen of England ! Queen Alexandra . And the other was her sister , the Dowager Empress of Russia ! The King of England , Edward , he was much too fat to make this ride , the Carvens told me , so he was apparently back on the yacht . Imagine ! I was thrilled to pieces . " And I learned a new word . Incognito . ' All these royal people were traveling incognito , ' according to the Carvens , which meant they did n't have to go through official receptions and so on , and it all rather put my Lord and Lady Carven on the spot ! To recognize or not to recognize ? So they never spoke . No one spoke . But my , did they bow ! " The Queen of England , thought Lyle , the Empress of Russia . Yachts . Incognito . Don Chafin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , as they say around here , living pretty high on the hog that trip . But , let 's see , I was going  | to tell you about Pompeii . In the next day or two we took a carriage out to Pompeii . Am I boring you to death ? " she asked a little timidly . " Course you 're not , " he replied . " It 's funny , you never told me these stories before . " " I have n't thought of them in so long ! " She smoothed back her hair on both sides from her temples . " You see , when Reverend Roanoke showed me my . . . inner light , well , I sort of put away and forgot about most things that had happened before , because this new adventure of the spirit held so much more significance , so very much more . But after all , some interesting things have happened to me , and that trip was certainly one of them . It surely was . Curious how you can close a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volume of your biography , close it and completely forget about it , never glance at it . Then one day something happens , your son comes to you and seems somehow in danger of .. . that he and in fact all of us . . . Well , I 'm losing my train of thought . " " What were you going to say just then ? " he demanded . " I 'm coming to it , I 'm coming to it all . " She drew a long breath . " We arrived , the four of us , and our own private guide who spoke excellent English , at Pompeii . You 've read about it ? " He shook his head . " It was a city of pleasure . It was for the wealthy , and they had splendid villas there , and there were beautiful theaters and baths and shops . They had lovely jewelry and vases , and you can be sure the food and wine were the best , and that they had plenty of wonderful servants ? slaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead ? " a . . . house of pleasure there . " " House of pleasure ? ' You mean a ? " " Yes . All the pleasures of the flesh were catered to in this city . It was a resort city , an unusual city , isolated , privileged . " They 'd erected it just below Mount Vesuvius , which had been sleeping , sleeping not dead , for a long time . "  | " Oh yeah . Now I remember . One day it erupted . " " Very suddenly and very enormously Vesuvius erupted . So suddenly and so enormously that there was no time to flee , to save themselves and their jewelry and even their pet dogs . Everything was buried under ashes from the eruption . All the people and all the pleasure and all the wealth was destroyed , wiped out . " Then Minnie fell silent , rocking very slightly in her straight-backed chair and gazing before her . " Is that the end ? " She nodded faintly . " But I do n't get it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with me or anything ? " Minnie began to breathe rather deeply . " Lyle dear , " she said quietly , rising , " I 've got to go to my room now . I think I 'm just a wee bit tired . I must lie down , say a few little prayers . I 've rambled so , I 'm sorry , dear . " She drifted toward the door . " I will send for him . . . It will be all right . . . you 'll see . " Lyle decided to spend the night at home and return to Morgantown the next day after he learned that his father had gone to Cleveland , where an important shipping operation for West Virginia coal was being set up . He wo n't be here today or tonight , Lyle thought . A kind of chronic burden lifted up from him at this realization : he wo n't be here in this house while I am here . There was about this spacious , high-ceilinged mansion today a peculiarly gracious air of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others softly coming and going , unhurried , aware that their mistress was incapable of addressing an unkind word to them , equally aware that in their quiet , unhurried way they were good at what they did and so were undeserving of unkind words . They were not in a hurry ; they knew what they were doing . Confidence permeated the house . 184  | Lyle came slowly down the flights of stairs to the octagonal hall on the ground floor and then wandered out to the pantry and kitchens . On a sideboard next to the big , gas-heated range Tot in her long , shapeless blue dress was rolling dough in flour . " Biscuits ? " he asked hopefully . " Some of your biscuits ? " " That 's right , that 's it , Mr. Lyle . " " How 'd you know I was staying for dinner ? " " I knew . " " Biscuits , " he repeated contentedly . Tot 's biscuits were really the next best thing in this world to Canadian whiskey . Why had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place down on River Street where in a few minutes he could be buying as many bottles of it as he wanted . Then he resolutely turned his thoughts elsewhere . Lyle went out the kitchen door , across the latticed-in back porch with the garbage cans , the smell of decaying food rising from them , and out onto the lawn . This was Angelo 's domain . He was not in sight at the moment , but the evidence of his devotion to the earth and what grew out of it , when lovingly tended , was everywhere : silken grass , flower beds with chiseled borders , trees pruned into maximum shapeliness ; the recently painted , spotless gazebo . Great golden-leafed trees swayed overhead ; the almost unbearably nostalgic smell of burning leaves drifted to him ? that was what Angelo must be doing behind the barn . How could he feel this overwhelming sense of nostalgia when he smelled autumnal leaves burning when he had hardly any past to be nostalgic for ? It was as though he had lived before , somehow , and suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed , had passed through his fingers and disappeared . Jesus , he reflected wryly , they 'd take me off to Weston if they knew what I was thinking . I guess I 'm like Ma in a way , kind of like a dreamer with maybe too much imagination or feelings too strong or some-  | thing like that . I wonder if this Reverend Roanoke guy is some kind of confidence man , asking Mother for a lot of money ? Or could he be the real thing ? Could he do anything for me ? Exactly what do I need done , anyhow ? He sat down and then stretched out on the silken grass . The October breezes whipped and drifted over him , the smell of the burning leaves mingling so evocatively that he felt himself sinking almost into a trance of past romance and limitless , unfulfillable future possibilities . Unfulfillable future possibilities : that was the bitter crux of his problem . There was no possibility of achieving one eighth of what his inner spirit , the blind beast , was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the moon , and so he was going to be condemned to a life of frustration and failure , terrible incompleteness , gorgeous dreams turning as sour as that stale food in the garbage cans . That was it : his life would drift from the wondrous odor of autumn 's burning leaves to the rotting vegetables and scraps of decaying meat in the garbage cans . After a while Lyle got up from the grass , talked for a little while to short , burly Angelo , or attempted to talk to him . Angelo spoke with his hands and arms and his back and he spoke nature ; to people , in English , he had little to say and little vocabulary to say it with . " Nice , " " good , " " grow , " and " beautiful " were the pillars of his speech . Then Lyle wandered on to the big barn , still with hay in the hayloft although all the horses beneath it had been replaced by the Packard , the Hupmobile , the Stutz Bearcat and the Model T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish this were my house , he thought suddenly , and this unbidden thought had a vehemence which surprised him . What if this were mine ? A blissful feeling flowed through him , something the best Canadian whiskey ever distilled could n't begin to induce . This feeling surprised him too . E186  | He and Minnie had dinner that night , sitting at opposite ends of the dining room table . It was a meal Lyle would subsequently remember as peculiarly charmed and , well , civilized , somehow linked to her stories of yachts and queens , the to him fairy-tale world she had once briefly inhabited , of lords and ladies , the Mediterranean Sea and the ruins of Pompeii , a world commensurate with the dreams induced in him by autumnal leaves burning : there were places where romantic ambitions could be fulfilled , had been , by his mother and father . And it had all sprung up from his , Clarkson 's , dominance of an important segment of the coal industry , of King Coal , in northern and in southern West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other way , and the little flickering flames caught jeweled reflections in the crystal and cut glass , the silver and the mirrors , as Thomasina glided softly in with the baked ham and the yams , with the famous biscuits , with homemade peach ice cream and angel food cake . Minnie even served a little wine . " This is an occasion , " she said gaily , " having my boy all to myself at home . You know your father never liked wine , even hated having it around all the time during our tour of the Mediterranean . Said it was bad for your teeth ! But lately , since Prohibition came in , he just , well , thinks it 's the principle of the thing to buy it and have it in the house and sometimes serve it . Who ever heard of West Virginians not being able to drink if we want to ! " " Yeah . They 're lucky we 're not making it ourselves in the basement . " " Lots of people are . You must never drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you only knew , he said to himself ruefully , remembering the strange disastrous liquids he 'd downed during the weekend party in Morgantown , if you only knew .  | " Gaston Hayes had to be taken to the hospital after he and his brother made some gin in their barn . Pony got into it . Killed the poor beast . " " Are you sure , Mother ? " " Word of honor . Fell dead . " " Well , " said Lyle , sipping his wine in a worldly manner , " I think it 's great to have wine with dinner . " " I do too . Your father , " she went on smilingly , " thinks it 's foreign . " " What 's wrong with learning some good things from foreigners ? " She sighed lightly . " You 're like me in a way . You take after me some , in the ways you think , ways you feel . Unless it was something to do with mining your father does n't think we have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been teaching them everything new even in mining for the last twenty years . " " Gee would I love to go to Europe . " " The Carvens of Medford . . . those people I was telling you about ? With the yacht ? " Minnie was mellowing , becoming a little dreamy from the wine . " They planned on sending their son soon as he finished his schooling at Oxford University on a Grand Tour . " " They did ! A Grand Tour ! Lord-ee . What is it exactly , a Grand Tour ? " " Oh , those English lords send their sons ? not their daughters , just their sons ? on a long trip , a really long trip , all over Europe . Paris , Florence , Athens , everywhere that is rich in history , culture . " And wine , women , and song , reflected Lyle sagely. " ? not just traveling there but staying in those places , learning what I remember Lady Carven called Restaurant French ' for instance in Paris , and Museum Italian ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She gazed the length of the table at him . " You get good grades at the university and maybe we can persuade your father to let you have , well , if not a Grand Tour then maybe a Petite Tour . " " A Petite Tour ? " " Yes , a little version . " " I sure would like that . Shoot , I 've hardly been any farther than Logan . " And what struck Lyle and fixed itself in his mind were the ties of power , the links from that lost little mining town deep in the broken hills of southwestern West Virginia to the great world of London and the Continent . And the lines were power and money , and the owners , Lord Carven of Medford and , yes , Clarkson Catherwood of the Castle , had it and were fighting , with Don Chafin and with bullets and with aeroplanes if necessary , to keep it , and the United Mine Workers and Frank Keeney were trying to take it way from them . How ridiculous he , Lyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of that battle . Hell , he should have been on the crest of Blair Mountain , right alongside Don Chafin . What if Chafin was a bully ? You had to fight fire with fire and the miners ' side wanted to take all that power , leading from Main Street , Logan , to the rim of Vesuvius , take it away from the Catherwoods and the Cliftons and just sort of scatter it all over the state ! The hell with it . Lyle buttered one of Tot 's immortal biscuits firmly and realized that he was just going to have to get a lot tougher , a lot more ? as his father put it ? savvy , learn the business and hang on to the power and realize his dreams . But then a vision of some of those mining towns he had gone through on the train heading toward Blair Mountain including the one where he had slept , the grime and the unbelievable flimsiness of the houses where the miners and  | their families lived , the terrible streets , lousy drainage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision rose up before his eyes . " You thinking about something , Lyle ? " " No , well , yes , sort of . I was thinking about what you talked about , about Pompeii , the city of pleasure , buried under the ashes . I think I know what you were trying to say . " He moved some food around his plate with his fork . " And it does n't have to happen . Not here . " " We must not be too selfish , not in the future as we have been in the past . " But if you give in some , Lyle asked himself , then wo n't they take it all away from you ? And would he ever be the kind of man to keep them from doing so , after his father and Marcus Clifton and all of them were gone ? This visit to his mother lifted Lyle 's spirits momentarily . It was uncanny how much better he felt just from his talk with her , his stroll around the place , and that dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way , or gave him a shot of confidence . He felt capable , momentarily . But upon his return to Morgantown , the chaotic room in the fraternity house , to his classes , to his attempts at reform , all of this infusion of strength drained away and he became his old struggling self again , ineffectual in his own eyes , the rich kid who showed no potential , even to his own father , of ever really growing up . Somehow , the tremendously expensive Pierce-Arrow Raceabout with which his father replaced the demolished Stutz  | almost without comment , as though he had expected as much , made Lyle feel subtly worse . The following week Lyle received a letter . It was impressive-looking , in a long envelope made out of stiff paper , and addressed in handwriting of flowing , curlicued grace . The name on the envelope was " Master Lyle Catherwood . " Master . Very curious , Lyle tore it open to see several pages of stiff white paper and a message in the same elaborate , graceful hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt of a missive from your esteemed mother and at her behest I am communicating with you . That lady , whose salvation it was my holy privilege to bring into the glorious light of reality and so suffuse her soul with all the virtues theretofore locked within her , has requested me to communicate with you to determine whether we should meet . Should we meet ? If we met , if your spirit calls for such a meeting , if such a meeting is sought by your spirit , then I am ready to join with you . As a practical matter , and the Lord in His wisdom presents us with practical problems so that we may utilize His grace in solving them , I am in Simmons , Arkansas , and you are in Morgantown , West Virginia . But see how the Lord works his mysterious ways ? He has inspired your sainted mother to send to me a most substantial monetary contribution , more than enough for me to go to the depot and purchase a round-trip ticket from here to there . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I might join together with in prayer during such a visit . Truly I believe God brought you to your present spiritual crisis that your mother might be given an opportunity to display her Divine Generosity and that I might thus be providentially given this opportunity to return to my vineyards in the hills , my vineyards of souls , to pray together with them once more . But it is with you that this pilgrimage will in the first instance  | be concerned , for these others I mention are all already within the Caves of God ( as gathered grapes from vineyards are pressed , poured into casks and places in Caves , as Our Lord was born in a Cave , not a Stable as popular myth would have it , but a Cave , and buried in yet another Cave , from whence He rose ) ; the others would be met with by me so that all might join together once again in a Prayer of Thanksgiving and glorification unto God the Savior . But it is to you that I direct my inquiring thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might pray together ? I say no more , not of the outcome of our prayer or of any specific purpose of such praying together . I simply ask in the Service of God whether such is your wish . May God 's transforming light shine ever more brightly upon you . Yours in Jesus , in the Father , and in the Holy Ghost , Ramsey Fullylove Roanoke Minister of the Church of the Last Judgment Strolling slowly across the campus on an overcast , windy November day , Lyle reread this letter . He read it a third time . The Reverend Roanoke : Lyle could remember what his mother had been like before the revelation , real or fabricated , by Reverend Roanoke , to know what a change had been wrought . He remembered her tentative touch , her thin , self-doubting voice , her wraithlike white dresses . And he recalled his latest visit to the Castle , her stylish clothes , her warm voice , her embrace . Verily , as Reverend Roanoke would undoubtedly say , verily a change had been wrought . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution , " had she ? There was money involved between her and Reverend Roanoke , always had been . His father , he knew , had given Reverend Roanoke money too , paid him off , some said ( Thomasina for one , who had never had any truck with the Church of the Last Judgment , being a hardshell Baptist born and bred ) . Was he a fraud ? Was he a confidence man ?  | Or did he have the gift of seeing into souls ? Troubled souls ? God knew Lyle had one of those , if ? as he sometimes asked himself when his worthlessness became truly overpowering ? he had a soul at all . At least Reverend Roanoke might be able to establish that , once and for all . Lyle went back to his room and replied to the letter as follows : Dear Reverend Roanoke : I have received your letter of November 2nd . Of course my mother has spoken to me of you . And I remember meeting you long ago with her in Bennettown , although I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I do n't know if I am in a " spiritual crisis " as my mother apparently told you I was , or what , but if you want to come up here , and I know a lot of people would be glad to see you in our hills again , then I will meet with you , and I guess we will " pray together " because I guess that 's what you do , is n't it . I can tell from your letter that you do n't believe in making any promises and I do n't believe in making any promises either , especially if I 'm not sure I can keep them . And I do n't know exactly what the result of us meeting together and praying is going to turn out to be , but I am willing to find out . Sincerely yours , Lyle Catherwood When his mother reached him by telephone ten days later he knew the message would be about Reverend Roanoke . " He 's here ! " she called excitedly . " At the Castle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bennettown with some of his old parishioners . And he 's looking forward to meeting with you , praying with you . Can you come up here tomorrow ? " " Ah ? yeah , I guess so . "  | " Good , " she said crisply . These days when his mother wanted something to happen she wanted it to happen . " Why do n't you drive up here in time for lunch and then we ? I mean you ? will meet with the Reverend . " " Where 's Dad ? " " Your father will be in Cumberland tomorrow . " " Ah ? do I have to do anything , anything in the way of preparing ? Go on a fast , or something like that ? " Lyle began to feel giddy , even silly . " Or take eighteen baths ? Shave my head ? Light candles ? " " That will be enough , Lyle . This is the most serious of matters . " " Yes , I know . " " You merely have to approach it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging up , Lyle felt he possessed an open mind all right . But a trusting spirit ? That he was far from sure of . Trust this Negro stranger who took money from his mother behind his father 's back ? Who wrote letters that sounded like enormous gusts of hot air ? For that matter , did he trust anybody ? Including himself ? Well , that one at least he could answer flatly . He sure did not trust himself . And for that reason , he suddenly saw , he did n't trust anybody else . Could n't . Who knew ? Maybe this black spellbinder really could break through all of this and disentangle Lyle 's inner confusions . There was his mother , stark evidence that Reverend Roanoke had accomplished something unmistakably good . Well , Lyle would just go up there to Middleburg and see . What about some Canadian whiskey ? No , no , a thousand times NO.  | When he arrived at the Castle , Minnie , in a blue wool overcoat with a big fur collar and a blue hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was waiting for him , sitting beside the suit of armor in the octagonal hall . " I guess we 're going to meet Reverend Roanoke out somewhere , is that it ? " he asked after greeting her . " Yes , George is bringing the car around . " " Just where are we meeting him ? " Minnie glanced upward , toward the big , bulbous chandelier high overhead , then here and there , and finally answered , " It 's in the car , we 're meeting him there . " " In the car ? " " Yes , " she murmured quietly . " But what a nutty place . Why ? " " It 's what he requested . " That gave Lyle material for reflection . Did it mean that here in West Virginia Reverend Roanoke felt he had to keep moving ? Or what ? George entered from the porte cochere side , in his full black chauffeur 's uniform cap and gloves , a getup he was rarely expected to bother with except for Sunday church and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Packard and it rolled slowly down the driveway . " Of course I wo n't be present when you and the Reverend pray together , " said Minnie . " I ? I will be in the front with Uncle George , and I will not look back here , and of course we ca n't hear through that dividing glass . As Reverend Roanoke always said , we can meet together and pray together anywhere ? in a great cathedral , in the great out-of-doors , in a cave , a barn , or in ? " " A Packard limousine ? " " Yes , " she said softly . 01951  | Lyle saw that Minnie was firmly resisting in herself any doubts or questions arising in her mind from Reverend Roanoke 's strange choice of meeting place . The rich grumble of the car 's engine preceded them down Middleburg Avenue , through the center of town and out on the road to Bennettown . " We 're picking him up out here someplace . George knows where . " It was another overcast , windy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly stripped of leaves , swaying rather lugubriously in the wind . West Virginia , so fresh and radiant through the warm months , an upland after all , bathed in forest-cleansed air , settled during the cold months into days and weeks of brooding , clammy grayness and gloom . What happened to the dirty , sooty look of everything during the sparkling summer days , Lyle had often wondered . Now , in this glum November weather , he realized the answer : the light bleached it out . There was neither more nor less dirt and grit , but the fresh , glowing quality of the light redeemed it all . Now there was grimness , November to March , when the isolated settlers of old must have huddled in their log cabins and stoically waited it out , not the gales and blizzards of the North , but the gloomy chill and brooding deadness in nature of the Appalachian Mountains , wintertime . They reached a particularly steep hill and the Packard went cautiously down it in first gear to the hamlet of Jessie Mae . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right , stood Reverend Roanoke , broader than before , dressed in a dark overcoat and a derby hat , and , as the limousine rolled majestically up alongside him , he tipped his hat and smiled broadly . After a confusion of greetings , exclamations of pleasure , exchanges of evangelical salutations , mutual congratulations upon fine physical appearance , passing expressions of regret that the countryside was not at its best , seating in the car was  | rearranged and Lyle found himself in the capacious rear compartment with the Reverend Roanoke on a jump seat in front of him but turned around in his direction . On the other side of the closed inside window , George shifted the car cautiously into gear and proceeded aimlessly , farther into the country , and Minnie rather ostentatiously buried her nose in a small leatherbound book she had produced from her purse . Reverend Roanoke turned and reached just above the dividing window and pulled down a gray silk window blind . Lyle had never noticed it before . Then he began pulling down blinds over the exterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these before either . " Now this is all we need , " Reverend Roanoke rumbled cheerfully in his resonant voice , " just any quiet private place where we can meet together . " Reverend Roanoke 's strong , wide , dark brown head was about half bald , and the remaining hair , curly and grizzled . Otherwise he did not look as old as Lyle calculated he must be . He looked healthy , except that the whites of his eyes were yellowish , and there was an exhausted cast which flickered over them now and then . " Why 'd you pick the car ? " inquired Lyle . " Seems Iike a very funny place , even if it is quiet and private . And it ai n't really even that , not with the engine running and two people settin ' two feet from you . " " Brother , " Reverend Roanoke began , " and I feel that all of us are brothers and sisters on this earth , all of us who seek salvation ? brother , there are problems in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother sent me the wherewithal to make this journey . Some are more complicated . Here in West Virginia there are those who oppose my mission ? I tell you frankly ? who would seek to prevent me from going about my duties . The clergymen at the established churches here , they say I bring dishonor upon the  | cloth , " he smiled beneficently , " that I am a charlatan . " Lyle knew his face betrayed his amazement at hearing the Reverend Roanoke bring this charge up himself . " I see you have entertained that suspicion yourself . It is only natural . Who am I ? Where do I come from ? What is my education ? What are my credentials ? These are questions you would like to ask , are n't they ? " " Only about your education . You speak such . . . " " Highfalutin " was on the tip of his tongue . " . . . good English , so educated . Where were you educated ? " " At the Tuskegee Institute , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Booker T. Washington , said that I had a better command of English than any of his other students . My mother was educated ; she was a slave but she was educated . She was a reader . She read stories to the white ladies in the plantation house in Alabama . They did n't teach her to read . She taught herself , picked up books around the mansion and snuck them to her shack and read them . Then when the white folks found that out they did n't punish her as most of them would ? slaves were n't allowed to get educated , you knew that " ? Lyle had n't ; not allowed to get educated ? " but these folks were kindly and they were educated and they decided to use her talent , instead of punishing it . So she taught me to read and to speak and I got to go to the Tuskegee Institute and Mr. Booker T. Washington himself encouraged me , said I could be the best Negro preacher in the country . And I could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was that ? " " I did n't want to preach to only colored people . White people needed to know about salvation too . And I could tell them . Ever since I was about twelve years old I knew who was saved ! I just plain knew . Well , the colored folks had their churches and the white folks had their churches and ai n't nobody , as colored folks say , wanten to go to a mixed  | church ! And that 's what I had to have . So they did n't want me as a preacher in the colored churches , I mean the ones that have a permanent roof over their heads and staying in one place and all , they could n't use me if I was trying to bring white people in too . So " ? he drew a deep , resigned breath ? " I had to set up in barns and caves and keep moving , because if I do n't I get into trouble . So we 're moving , right now . Maybe I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older . It gets a lot harder . " I like this fellow , thought Lyle . Do I trust him ? Nodding in an unemphatically proud way at him , Reverend Roanoke said , " Brother , are we ready to pray together ? " Lyle nodded , and matching Reverend Roanoke 's gesture he joined his hands . They were facing each other . Reverend Roanoke 's eyes closed ; Lyle closed his . And then began a long prayer , recited in the Reverend 's deep , confident voice . He really is speaking to God , thought Lyle in awe . At least he is absolutely sure himself that he is . I can hear it in his voice . Oh boy , what have I got myself into ! No , no , concentrate , forget yourself for a change , follow the prayer , pray ! " . . . if You choose once again to confer upon Your humble servant Ramsey Fullylove the gift of seeing into another human soul , one soul which is seeking its salvation , striving to know that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You grant once more this gift , so that he can know that he stands beside his sainted mother in Thy eternal light , that he is joined with her in a confident expectation of eternal happiness with Thee in Heaven . Can he know that , O Lord ? Will You deign to show to me , Your humblest servant , the pure light of Your salvation shining beneath the toil of this young and troubled soul ? May I be granted the gift of seeing it ? What joy fills my soul when once more I behold it . 0 what transports ! " He is in touch , Lyle said tensely to himself . He is speaking to God . He is going to be  | able to tell me . Good God , how exposed I am . Great Christ , my mother is in the front seat ! There was a long , fervent silence . And then Lyle somehow knew he must open his eyes . He did so and a second or two later Reverend Roanoke opened his and stared into Lyle 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whites their whitish-yellow color , the momentary exhausted look had vanished into a glare of concentration . Am I being hypnotized , Lyle wondered tautly . He had never felt so tense before , it was in every muscle , every nerve . He can see all those bottles of Canadian whiskey in my eyes , and all that rotgut I 've drunk too , and my bad sex habit and the lies and ... And now , Lyle thought , I am going to be shown that all those weaknesses of mine do n't matter , and that I am saved . And somewhere deep at the center of his brain a tiny voice concurred : he wo n't dare do anything else , not with the son of Minnie Catherwood . Reverend Roanoke broke suddenly from glaring into his eyes ; he glanced sideways , and then jerked his gaze once more back into Lyle 's eyes . Then the Reverend looked down , looked sideways , pulled back . " I ? there 's nothing ? I ca n't see if ? " " Do n't lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constricted , authoritative voice , new to him . Reverend Roanoke met his gaze for a moment again , then looked away . " I do n't know , " he muttered . " I can only tell those who are saved . I do n't know if the others are ... if ... Only I ca n't see that they are saved . I just ca n't see it , " he finished in a muffled voice . That 's it , thought Lyle fatalistically . I 've always known it . Damned : I have been , all my life . I 've always felt it . There 's something broken in me . Even the blind beast wants out . He leaned across and , raising the shade , rapped on the window .  | " We can go back now , " he said to Minnie and George , who continued staring blankly at him . Then recollecting , he wound down the window . " It 's over , " he mumbled . " We can go back . " Minnie took a long look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beautiful meadow , " she said . " What ? " he asked thickly . " Perfectly beautiful meadow over there . And a fine field beyond it . Farmland . Anyone can see how fertile it is . Is n't this a pretty corner of the county . Even on a day like this . I 've never been this far on this road before . Beautiful . You know where we are , do you , George ? " " Yes 'm . " " I want to find out about that land . I do n't think it 's being cultivated . Probably just for grazing . " What in God 's name is she rambling about , Lyle demanded to himself . " Let 's go back , George , " she finished . George turned the car around , backing into a dirt track which led into the sloping sweep of farmland Minnie had been admiring , and they proceeded back along the road , Lyle lost in an air of total unreality . All the blinds in the back seat had been raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her left arm along the top of the front seat , and now she began chatting about the countryside . She seemed completely at ease and was in fact turning this mobile prayer meeting into a Sunday outing kind of drive , no more significant than any other outing . Lyle felt in the depths of unreality and a strange alienation ? she 's saved , I 'm damned ? and an overwhelming sense of needing to run , run away , ship out on a boat for China , join the Marines , kill himself , get drunk , go work in a coal mine and get killed in a cave-in . He was in oblivion already , always had been , only now this colored man had made him see it and above all feel it . 201  | Why had he ever sobered up ? Minnie chatted along pleasantly about the countryside , then she mentioned a farm in Maryland where she had spent summers as a girl , her grandparents ' place , and how Clarkson was a farm boy really , but then so were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first generation in which so many grew up in towns or cities . " A farm is all there is , really , " she finished cryptically . Reverend Roanoke sat on his jump seat , hands clasped between his knees . There are two blacks and two whites in this car , Lyle thought suddenly . They could attack us if they wanted to . The idea of Uncle George attacking him and Minnie was grotesque but still he thought it . Slaves have rebelled before , he reflected cautiously . Uncle George was not a slave , he could quit tomorrow and go to New York , but still he thought it . They reached the little hamlet of Jessie Mae again . Nodding apologetically to Lyle as he moved , Reverend Roanoke got out of the back seat . Minnie got out of the front seat . They stood for a moment in the road , communicating with some kind of spiritual intimacy . She thanked him for coming . She pressed an envelope into his hand . More money , Lyle thought . Then Reverend Roanoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you let me give you a blessing for God ? " he asked Lyle soberly . Lyle grimaced . The Reverend raised his right hand and murmured a few words . " We will save Lyle , " Minnie then said in a tone Lyle had never heard , quiet but exalted , as though she were the Angel Gabriel and this were the Annunciation . Lyle wanted to die on the spot . Then she climbed into the back seat with him , helped by Reverend Roanoke , and with a last exchange of waves they drove off .  | The following week Minnie persuaded Clarkson to buy the farm she had noticed during this drive . The weekend following the Doomsday Drive , as Lyle came to think of his excursion with Reverend Roanoke , he returned to Middleburg . He had spent the intervening week almost losing himself in Canadian whiskey but not quite . He had gotten some bottles of it , but he only took a bracing gulp once in a while , and offered some to his friends . In limbo , preparatory he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was a seer , just as in an odd way his mother was ? Lyle tottered but did not quite fall . What the hell , something might turn up . Had n't Saint Paul been saved from evil on the road to Damascus ? Anything was possible . In Middleburg that weekend ? raw , gusty , a liverish sky ? Lyle took a solitary walk Saturday afternoon down Raccoon Hollow , a steep-walled ravine between two parts of town . He was proceeding down the dirt road , concentrating on kicking stones , when he saw , crossing the Fourth Street Bridge which spanned the ravine above him , a solitary figure , head slightly bent against the gusts of chilly wind . He knew he recognized her but could n't immediately realize who it was . Impulsively he put two fingers between his teeth and let out the whistle which could startle horses at a hundred yards . She glanced down and he thought : good Christ , the Widow Pence . Covered with embarrassment and guilt , Lyle nevertheless felt he had to wave at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to come down , via a long flight of wooden steps set into the side of the ravine . He did n't know why he did that ; it was just something to cover his embarrassment . To his surprise he saw that Mrs. Pence was complying . As she made her way down the long zigzag flight of steps with the wind whipping her rain hat and raincoat and  | skirt he noticed a certain grace about her . Willowy , that was the word they used for women like that . She came up to him , a little out of breath . " I 'm glad I ran into you . I was meaning to write you , I was going to today for sure . I ? it was real nice of you . Not charity , debt . ' I liked that , I understood it . It was thoughtful . So that 's how I accepted it , and ... thank you . " Lyle stared at her , nonplussed . " Ah ? what do you mean , I mean , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order you sent . Five hundred dollars . And the note . I memorized it . You put it so well . Not charity , debt . Please take it . It will help me . With sincerest respects and deepest condolences , Lyle Catherwood : " Lyle 's face worked through and past amazement in two instants , and then he burst out , " Oh , that ! Yes , that ! Why I ? it was ? well , yes , not charity , debt . Yes , you , then it was okay , was it ? Good , great , well you never know , do you ? You never do know . I . . . uh . . . I 'm just walking on down the hollow . Your house is up the hill from the end of it , is n't it . Mind if I walk you home ? " " Of course not . " They proceeded down the dirt road between the high walls of the ravine , scraggly leafless growth clinging to them . In her high-heeled shoes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come up from the university often ? " she asked . Her voice was rather low-pitched , smoothed out , a little lower in her throat than that of other girls he knew . Older women sometimes had voices like that , but theirs had a quaver of age in them ; hers was energetic and young , but with this low pitch . He kind of liked it . And so to listen to it some more he asked her about herself . She had grown up in Poundville , an outlying mining camp , where her father had been superintendent of the mine . Then after studying at State Teachers College she had taught school , met Virgil , married , had a child , been widowed . And , an unspoken sentence seemed to add , her life was now  | over . But as she strode along beside him that did not seem to Lyle to be true at all . There was much too much vitality in her , and also a kind of breeziness which she herself seemed unconscious of . She just seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still shocked from the death of her husband three months before , but now unconsciously waiting for what came next . Something assuredly must come next , the second act in her life , for it was evident to the naked eye that Mrs. Pence had a good deal of living still to do , and that while the surface of her mind might have resigned itself to widowhood , child care , and gradual desuetude , the deeper layers of her mind , and the energy of her body , were preparing themselves for some more adventurous future . " What would you like to be when you grow up ? " Lyle suddenly asked . " Wh-what ? " she replied , glancing in a startled way sideways at him . Green eyes , he noted , very green , rather large . He grinned uncertainly at her and said , " We 're all still growing up , is n't that right ? I mean when you get older , what do you want for the future ? " " Oh well , the future . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , come on . Everybody 's got a future , you , your boy , me . " " My boy is my future . I 'm going back to teaching . That 's all I can do . " He walked on , kicking at likely stones . " I doubt it . " " You do , do you ? " she said , her voice becoming a shade cool . Lyle decided to plunge ahead . What had he to lose ? After all , he 'd given her five hundred dollars , he said to himself with boisterous self-mockery ( Had it come from his mother or his father ? ) . To her he blurted , " My dad says nature will take its course and you 'll get married again . " She strode on silently for several moments . " Nature will  | take its course , will it ? " she then said with an undertone of disdain . A proud lady , Lyle decided . " Your father does n't know me , does he ? " she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike , you know . Marriages do n't happen automatically , like springtime . I doubt very much I 'll ever remarry . I ca n't imagine it . " She gave a slight toss of her head and added , " I doubt very much that anybody would ask me again , with a child , the town full of pretty eighteen-year-old girls . I doubt it . " She pulled her coat about her against the clamminess of Raccoon Hollow . " Getting much colder , is n't it . Not much of a fall . How 's it been at the university ? " And seeing that she had closed the subject , Lyle told her how it had been at the university ? just exactly the same as it had been in Middleburg ? and they proceeded on briskly to the end of the ravine , and on up to her little house , where he took leave of her at the door . " I 'll bet the neighbors 'll think I 'm courting you , " he said teasingly . " Oh no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They were facing each other , and as she let fall this condescending dismissal he was thinking , Good God , she 's beautiful ! In the capacious barn set in trees across the lawn from the Castle , the former Harness Room had been converted by Clarkson , after the last horse to harness had been regretfully disposed of , into what he called his Research Room , but which the family simply called the Tipple . Tacked to the plain board walls were detailed maps of mines , showing which sections had been worked out , which remained to be mined , but these were not working plans , they were in the office downtown and at the mines . These were here for at 206  | mosphere , as Currier and Ives prints might be in other rooms , creating a congenial place for concentration . At a big piece of wood paneling mounted on two wooden horses with an engineering table lamp suspended over it , Clarkson sat on a stool and concentrated . His doctor might inveigh against the stool as aggravating Clarkson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back problems ? but Clarkson insisted on a stool . " My clerks sit on them , do n't they ? " he would ask rhetorically . " You can think better uncomfortable . " He did not discuss with his family what he worked on there because Clarkson was a man of rather few words , and his own quick mind was so intolerant of being bored that he had a fixed resolve never to be a bore himself , and he never was . His work , he believed , was a bore to any except other technically minded coal men , and with them only would he discuss it . The geological studies he pored over in the Tipple , in which he searched out the coal possibilities in contemplated acquisitions , the dumbbells in the corner he used every day to perform what he called his " physical jerks , " these occupations which gave him a keen , constructive sense of useful accomplishment were , he believed , unsuited for the essentially domestic and even feminine atmosphere of the Castle , and were besides Bores to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retreat with his reports , his dumbbells and his copy of The Case of the Bituminous Coal Mine Workers to the President 's Coal Commission , 1919 to his sequestered room in the barn . Here Lyle found him . after walking Mrs. Pence home . " Hi Dad . " " Son . " Clarkson had turned on his stool and was eyeing his son quizzically . Lyle virtually never came to the Tipple . If the library was his father 's room , the Tipple was his sanctuary . " I just wanted to ask you something about that . . . the  | money , that five hundred dollars that went to ... Mrs. Pence . It had my name on it ? " Clarkson 's eyebrows had gone up , and now they came down . " How 'd you hear about that ? " " I ran into her in Coon Hollow and " ? he began to giggle in spite of himself ? " she thanked me for it ! " " She did , did she ? " Clarkson commented , the ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? uh ? did n't seem offended at all , then ? " " Oh no . She said that thing I ' said in my ' message , Not charity , debt , ' that made it okay . Why 'd you sign my name to it ? " Clarkson placed his hands with their strong , square-tipped fingers on his knees and leaned forward a little . " Well , you see that was why . In case she got offended we could say it was just impulsive , a boy 's impulse . That 's all right with you , is n't it ? " " Oh sure ! " He did n't mind having the gift ascribed to him , far from it ; he was delighted , especially as she had accepted it so well . What he minded was being called a boy . Clarkson had begun to glance back toward the papers he was studying ( Bored with me already , thought Lyle ) when Lyle cut in , " There was one thing she did mind though . We started talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take its course and she 'd find another husband . That threw her for a loss ! Dropped back twenty yards on that play . " Clarkson frowned a little . " She was upset , was she ? You 11 should n't have said that to her . " " Oh I think she 's just kind of high-hat in her own way . " " And her husband gone just three months . You should n't have been talking about it . " " Do you mean you ' singular or you ' plural ? " Clarkson grimaced at this saucy question and Lyle immediately regretted it ; boyishness again . Shoot , he never  | would get it right with his dad . Also it was obvious that his father wanted now to get back to those reports about eight billion years ago in the Appalachian jungles , or whatever he was studying . If only he was n't so damn smart ! Or , he finished , if only I was smarter . From this first day Lyle felt compelled to see Mrs. Pence , see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society of Middleburg , West Virginia , and its taboos that appeared to be next to impossible . She was a widow and must be at least twenty-seven years old , maybe even thirty ; he was a rich eighteen-year-old college boy . Probably in New York or somewhere such a couple could meet , could go tea dancing at the Plaza Hotel , could take a carriage through Central Park , go rowing on the lake there , go to the Ziegfeld Follies , to speakeasies : all these romantic rendezvous would be possible in the great , carefree , sophisticated city . No one would raise an eyebrow . But here , tucked away in the West Virginia hills , with everybody staring down deep into the lives of everybody else , with the moves of your life laid out for you as carefully as a minuet , it just seemed totally impossible . Take her to a country club dance ? People would think both he and she were mad , and drunk as skunks besides . Go to the pictures with her ? They would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indulgently dismissed as a boy sowing his wild oats ; she would be branded a golddigging adventuress trying to rob the cradle . It would be Mrs. Pence who would suffer . Hell , they would probably fire her from her teaching job : they would certainly do that , he remembered a similar case from a year or two before . What a quandary . C 209 J
