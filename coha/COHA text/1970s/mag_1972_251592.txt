He was , they said , too old ( 70 ) and too ill ( suffering from what had been vaguely described as a blood disease ) to take part in last month 's singlehanded transatlantic sailboat race . But Globe Girdler Sir Francis Chichester sailed off anyway , was reported missing for several days , and became the object of extensive air and sea searches before he was located and helped back to port . Stung by continuing criticism , the aging mariner has now clearly identified his albatross-cancer of the spine-and attempted to justify his entry in the race . <P> In a straight-to-the-point letter to the Times of London , written from his bed at the Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth , Sir Francis explained : " After returning from my round-the-world trip in 1967 , an illness developed and in due course it was discovered that I had a malignant growth near the base of my spine . The tumor spread to involve my spine and later other bones . With the help of appropriate treatment I have been fighting this trouble , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not prevent me from building a new yacht and improving the **26;5180;TOOLONG world speed record which I had held since 1967 . " <P> However , the growth presented two particular problems : " It made me become anemic and secondly , as the bones were increasingly affected , it became increasingly painful . " He injected himself with a painkiller , but discovered that " under its influence , I could not think clearly and in particular could not rely on my calculations . " Thus Sir Francis decided to quit the race , " not because of hazard to myself , but because of the risks to others if I passed out , which seemed probable . " Those risks taken by his rescuers were really unnecessary , Sir Francis intimated . " Although I shall always be grateful for the kindness and skill of the help I received from the Royal Navy in removing the damaged mizzenmast and sailing back , I still believe I would have made it alone . " Yet Sir Francis will probably follow doctors ' orders and not go sailing alone again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , wrote the Old Man of the Sea , would likely end " in a spinnaker run across the Styx from which there is no return .
