txt President Carter is sending his Secretary of State . Cyrus Vance , to Moscow . optimistic that the Soviet leadership wants to bargain in " good faith " on arms control . Recent statements by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev criticizing the Carter human-rights campaign should not prevent successful negotiations . the President said at his March 24 press conference . His human-rights campaign is " not connected with the search for peace . " the President reiterated . The fact that the Soviets would be welcoming the U.S. Secretary of State in Moscow and had helped develop an agenda for discussions with Mr. Vance indicated that the Soviets want to negotiate , he added . President Carter pointed out to reporters that in a recent speech Mr. Brezhnev had carefully separated his remarks on human rights from his comments on arms control . The President once again told newsmen that he has " an unswerving commitment on human rights . " The President said Mr. Vance and Soviet leaders had agreed to discussions in the following areas : Also on the Moscow agenda , he indicated : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and balanced force reductions in Europe . ? Testing of nuclear devices ? hopefully elimination of such testing . ? Demilitarization of the Indian Ocean . ? Africa 's future , particularly methods of removing interference by outside powers that could lead to war . ? Groundwork for a Geneva conference on the Middle East . Administration officials expect Moscow to do a bit of lecturing to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance when he gets to Moscow , but they also expect that " we 'll do business . " Some officials anticipate the Soviets will take a hard line at the start ? a standard negotiating ploy ? in order to appear more conciliatory later on . There may be an attempt to get the United States to lessen its support for Soviet dissidents , but American officials say they are convinced that disagreement with the Kremlin over the human-rights issue will not interfere with progress toward a new arms control agreement . // From page .1 Carter optimistic on arms talks " I think we have to recognize that arms control matters stand on their own feet , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiator , in a Monitor interview . Mr. Warnke is accompanying Mr. Vance to Moscow for the first formal , high-level encounter ( March 28-30 ) between the Soviets and Americans since President Carter took office . The mood of U.S. officials such as Mr. Warnke as they go into the talks in Moscow seems to be , as one of them put it , that " you can negotiate with the Russians without being nice to them . " One official concerned with preparations for the trip said , " We wo n't be kissed and we wo n't be hugged and we 'll get a talking to . There wo n't be any extravagant toasts . But we 'll do business . " The tone for the American attitude was set by President Carter when he disagreed with what he apparenity considered to be alarmist interpretations of Soviet Secretary General Leonid Brezhnev 's March 21 speech at a congress of trade unions of the U.S.S.R. Mr. Brezhnev accused the Carter administration of using the human-rights issue to interfere in the Soviet Union 's internal affairs and warned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unthinkable . " Reacting to cries of alarm over Mr. Brezhnev 's speech , Mr. Carter was quoted as having told congressional leaders at a breakfast that " some people are concerned every time Brezhnev sneezes . " Mr. Carter seems to be taking an equally calm view toward " hawkish " critics who contend that the Soviets are striving towrd strategic superiority over the United States and have a chance of achieving it . A number of officials in the Ford administration sounded such warnings shortly before they left office . In contrast , the new national security and arms control teams under Mr. Carter seem to be stressing the theme that the United States has a strong technological edge over the U.S.S.R. in the development of strategic weapons and that if the Soviets want to get into an accelerated arms race with the U.S. they will be the losers . " Certainly you 're not going to be able to negotiate a SALT H strategic arms limitation talks agreement in three days in Moscow , " said Mr. Warlike . " It 's . . . a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing what sort of reaction you get and seeing if we ca n't begin to set the framework for the actual detailed negotiations in Geneva . " Concerning Mr. Brezhnev 's criticisms of the United States , Mr. Warlike said , " You 've got to decide arms control questions on the basis of national security considerations and that 's not going to be changed by the current climate or overall relations with the other country . " The full Brezhnev speech , with all its points taken in context , was " not discouraging in terms of the prospects for arms control , " he added . " It obviously expresses considerable opposition to our criticism , but I think it recognizes the fact that arms control is a separate question , " Mr. Warnke said . " There 's no question of the fact that we do n't approve of the Soviet internal system , and they 've indicated they do n't approve of ours , " he said . " Mr. Brezhnev , " he said , " has made a number of statements about the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union from encouraging the advance of socialism internationally . " " We 're both going to continue to pursue our objectives , " Mr. Warnke said . " We 've got different concepts of what the world ought to be , and we certainly are n't going to tailor ours to fit theirs . "
