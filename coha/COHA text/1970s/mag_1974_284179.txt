He was the antithesis of Arkansas ' self-image . The state 's symbol is a raging razorback , and J. William Fulbright is an owl in gabardine . Though they did not profess to understand him very well or to endorse many of his views , the voters of Arkansas had for 30 years been sending Bill Fulbright to Washington . Like fond , if slightly baffled parents , they took pride in the national and global attention he won as the Senate 's foremost authority on foreign affairs . <P> But last week Arkansas turned on its most famous son and emphatically denied him a chance to gain a sixth term in the Senate . By the humiliating margin of 65.2% to 34.8% , Fulbright , 69 , lost the Democratic primary to Governor Dale Bumpers , 48 , who was still a country lawyer in Charleston ( pop . 1,497 ) four years ago when the Senator was leading his devastating attack on U.S. policy in Viet Nam . <P> The man who knocked Fulbright out of the Senate is a handsome , affable six-footer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Charleston merchant , Bumpers was always ambitious , but until 1970 he had achieved , besides a country law practice , only a seat on the local school board and the post of town attorney . The latter job came easily ; he was Charleston 's only lawyer . <P> Bumpers has been a rising political star from the moment 41/2 years ago when he stepped in front of a television camera in 1970 to challenge Orval Faubus in the Democratic gubernatorial primary . Faubus went down to defeat , although he had served as Governor for six terms , and Bumpers had so little money that he had to sell his dairy herd for $95,000 to pay campaign and family expenses . Then it was the turn of Governor Winthrop Rockefeller , the Republican incumbent . In the November election , Rockefeller called Bumpers " a vaguely pleasant fellow with one speech , a shoeshine and a smile . " The pleasant fellow attacked Rockefeller for his frequent absences from the state and won going away . <P> A populist , Bumpers has compiled a respectable record as Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state 's government into efficient , Cabinet-type units , Bumpers put Arkansas solidly in the black . Simultaneously , he managed to boost teachers ' salaries by an average of $2,000 , to expand the state 's systems of public kindergartens and colleges , and to increase from 20 to 85 the number of community care centers for the mentally retarded . He also raised the percentage of blacks among the state 's employees from less than 10% to 19% , roughly the same figure as in the state as a whole . <P> Yet for all his accomplishments , and Fulbright 's long and controversial record ( see box ) , Bumpers refused to argue specific issues with the Senator during the campaign . " We 're not issue-oriented , " Bumpers explained . " You develop too many issues and you get locked into positions . " Instead , Bumpers relied mainly upon his personal appeal , which was as folksy as Fulbright 's was cerebral . Bumpers assiduously cultivated his image as the candidate of the common man , the same fellow who had gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and , with his mellifluous baritone , led the Methodist Church choir back home in Charleston .
