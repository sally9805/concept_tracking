The geological record of the earth 's beginnings has been largely obliterated by erosion , volcanic activity , earthquakes and even the shifting of continents . Thus , scientists have looked with increasing eagerness to other celestial bodies for clues as to how their own planet was formed . Last week they were rewarded with a new bonanza of evidence .

Finally , the giant dust storm that was partially blinding the orbiting spacecraft 's television eyes subsided .
