GREEN JULIA by PAUL ABLEMAN <P> All of theater is an encounter group . <P> The playwright issues a challenge of some kind . The audience gives a positive or negative response . The nature of the challenge tends to shape the nature of the encounter , and the challenges may vary a great deal . <P> One type is what might be called the Rorschach-test play , a Harold Pinter specialty . The ambiguity of his plots and the opacity of his characters ' motivations leave the playgoer with the task of figuring out what the play means . In the process , each member of the audience reveals himself to himself . For playgoers who relish self-analysis and puzzle solving , the genre is extremely stimulating ; others may find it both irritating and baffling . <P> Green Julia is a Rorschach-test play and an awfully good one . It is the first full-length drama by Britain 's Paul Ableman , 45 , who has previously written three novels and some 50 abstract and surrealist playlets . Like most plays of this sort , Green Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only characters that the audience sees are Robert Lacey , a young plant physiologist , and Jacob Perew , a young economist . For some time , Perew ( John Pleshette ) and Lacey ( Fred Grandy ) have shared a flat in an English university town . They also share an active fantasy life which is hilariously funny yet shadowed by increasing hysteria . In this relationship Lacey is called Bradshaw and Perew is Carruthers . <P> In satirical postures and caricature voices , " Carruthers " plays bishop to " Bradshaw 's " priest , pukka sahib to his native , officer to his enlisted man , and schoolmaster to his pupil . The bantering wit of this role playing does not entirely disguise its hidden psychological vengeance . In these games , it is Perew who dominates and Lacey who is dependent and vulnerable . <P> Perew is leaving for the Far East , and we watch him try to pull one last manipulative ploy . He wants to saddle Lacey with his mistress , a promiscuous lush 14 years his senior who hangs out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unseen Julia of the title . Lacey refuses , but that scarcely settles the questions Playwright Ableman tantalizingly raises . Is Perew merely a heel trying to avoid emotional remorse ? Is he , perhaps , more in love with Julia than he lets on , enough to want to soften the blow of his departure ? Is it possible that he wants to bring a little fleshly warmth into Lacey 's loveless and lonely life ? Finally , as we see the ashen , tearless desolation on Lacey 's face after Perew leaves , must we not wonder if they are two latent homosexuals ? <P> These questions , which each playgoer will answer in his own way , give the play its haunting texture of actual life where paradoxes abound , contradictions prevail , and the course of events rarely parallels the fine geometry of logic . Both Pleshette and Grandy are outstanding , and Grandy , who graduated from Harvard in 1970 , is possibly the No. 1 off-Broadway acting find of this season . " T.E.K.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
