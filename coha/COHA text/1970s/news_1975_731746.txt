txt Should public funds be used to counter U.S. liquor-industry advertising now aimed at select groups such as young adults and blacks ? A number of alcoholism-prevention experts answer " yes . " Here in California , the state Legislature will soon decide if it should pioneer in this direction . A bill to make $1 million in state funds available for a program of film , television , and newspaper counter-advertising will be Introduced later this month by state Sen. Arlen Gregorio ( 1D ) of San Mateo-Santa Clara . The program would be designed by the state 's Office of Alcohol Program Management . Director Loren Archer favors a five-year , $200,000-a-year effort to balance what he calls a sophisticated , carefully targeted 11-quor-lndustry advertising campaign aimed at what the industry sees as the two prime markets of young adults and blacks . Mr. Archer also wants the state campaign aimed at Indiana and Mexican-Americans , two ethnic groups hesays show especially high alcoholism rates . The campaign would seek to educate on the dangers of excessive drinking , rather than to advertise against all alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautionary information of this kind is already being circulated by industry groups such as the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States ( DISCUS ) in Washington , D.C. , and the Wine Institute in San Franc4sco . In Pennsylvania the recent measure requires all state liquor stores to provide pamphlets teaching " when to say when " by graphically demonstrating the results of drinking different amounts of each kind of alcoholic beverage . Need for new program But the California proposal goes further . Growing out of last month 's Alcoholism Prevention Conference sponsored by the social research group at the School of Public Health , University of California , Berkeley , it is based on the assumption that preventive advertising must be as scientifically designed and specially targeted as industry promotion . // * Ads against liquor ads weighed // The nationally distributed " Liquor Handbook " is one that illustrates the need for a new program , according to Office of Alcohol Program and management director Loren Archer . This privately published volume widely read throughout the liquor industries gives marketing information which often influences industry advertising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , the handbook 's 1974 edition observes , " The black Americans are heaviest per-capita consumers of distilled spirits and form a disproportionately large sector of what is becoming the dominant youth market . " Mr. Archer maintains blacks are " targeted " because the industry realizes they will ' increasingly have more money to spend . The age group 18 through 34 has become a special target because " the majority of our population will be under 35 in the next five years , " and because " this is the group with the most disposable income , " he adds . Financing considered The public-advertising program would be financed either from general revenue or from a special state tax on liquor ? if the state Legislature chooses to pass a measure now before it to tax alcoholic beverages one-half cent per ounce of alcohol contained . The proposed tax would yield some $30 million a year , enough to alsq pick up the tab for California 's $19-milliona-year alcoholic rehabilitation program , according to the office of the new measure 's sponsor , also Senator Gregorio . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons under the influence of alcohol , director Archer suggests a large part of the revenue from the proposed tax should go as compensation to victims under the state 's " Victim of Violent Crime Fund , " established in 1965.
