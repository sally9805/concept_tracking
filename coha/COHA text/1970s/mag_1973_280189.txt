" He cooperated with all kinds of reactionaries , turned against the armed forces and behaved like a party leader of adventurists , fellow travelers , saboteurs and even murderers . " With those sharp words , Premier George Papadopoulos , in a ten-minute , nationwide broadcast , last week abolished the monarchy and appointed himself head of the new Greek Republic . <P> Papadopoulos , who is not only chief of the military junta that has ruled the nation since 1967 but also Greece 's regent , denounced exiled King Constantine ( see box ) for " an unforgiveable lack of maturity . " He accused Constantine of supporting an abortive coup planned by royalist naval officers , which gave Papadopoulos an ideal excuse to extend the junta 's heavyhanded rule and depose the King . <P> Under the constitution that Papadopoulos promulgated in 1968 , which provides that the King is titular head of state , last week 's announcement that Greece had become a republic was patently illegal . But it did not come as much of a surprise . Originally , the colonels had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some illusion of legitimacy . King Constantine 's refusal to return to Greece from exile in Rome until democracy was restored had long since made a mockery of that claim . <P> At week 's end there was no clear-cut evidence that Constantine had any knowledge of the attempt to overthrow the junta , which government spokesmen initially brushed off as an " operetta " involving " a handful " of men , including two retired admirals . But shortly afterward , 32 senior naval officers were arrested and presumably will be tried on charges of treason . Then 31 other navymen , led by the commander of the destroyer Velos , mutinied and were granted asylum at the port of Fiumicino in Italy . Then the government admitted that the " operetta " had been a serious attempt at revolution . <P> According to junta spokesmen , the plot called for " as many as possible " of the Greek navy 's ten destroyers and seven submarines to rendezvous at the Aegean island of Syros . From there , an ultimatum would be issued to the junta in Athens : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two principal ports . Piraeus and Salonika . <P> The night before the coup was to take place , three destroyer captains who had thrown in with the conspirators witlessly gave the plot away . With their vessels tied up at the tightly guarded Greek naval base in Salamis , the captains told crew members to remain aboard because of " top secret maneuvers " set for the next day . When no men went ashore that night , shore police became suspicious and began questioning the crew . After government officials heard the story about unscheduled maneuvers , the captains were arrested .
