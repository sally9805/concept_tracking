From midnight until 3 a.m. one day last week , China 's seemingly tireless Premier Chou En-lai talked with a group of visiting American scholars in Peking 's Great Hall of the People . China-born Journalist John McCook Roots reported to TIME on the session - probably the last such meeting before Richard Nixon arrives on Feb. 21 . Some of Chou 's comments : <P> THE WAR . If the American Government continues to back President Nixon 's eight points which the Viet Cong rejected in Paris last week , then it will not be possible to end the war , particularly in Viet Nam . Then the popular movement against American aggression will and should continue . <P> THE POWER STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD . <P> Your President has noted five power centers the U.S. , Russia , China , Japan and the European Common Market . We do not entirely agree . From the viewpoint of economic development there is such a trend , but from the viewpoint of the world 's movements of popular liberation-which hold the key to the future-all nations regardless of size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments find it difficult to agree . For the people , it is easier to achieve a common outlook . We look to the people . <P> THE RUSSIANS . When we stated at the United Nations that we are not a superpower and would never attempt to be one , one superpower the Soviet Union laughed and said China could not exist without a nuclear umbrella . As our Chinese proverb has it , that fellow " does not know how high the sky is or how deep the earth . " <P> THE AMERICANS . From our past experience , we in China place immense hopes on the American people . They are a very great people with many different beliefs and races but , we believe , a common aspiration . Their potential and prospects are boundless . <P> RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. Twenty or 30 years ago , many American friends visited us the Chinese Communists and exchanged views in a free way . Now that we have gained state power it may be thought that our views have become rigid . This is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where we can improve , we will listen . <P> HENRY KISSINGER . How is it possible to have another Metternich appear in this present day ? This man has his characteristics . He is a man with whom we can argue . <P> RICHARD NIXON . Your President has said neither too much nor too little . Who knows but he may alter his views ? He may change them . He may not . It does not matter . All of us should make efforts .
