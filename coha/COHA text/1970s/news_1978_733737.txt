IN THE END , there was a lot of sound and fury signifying that some people like to yell a lot . The first yelling of the day began many blocks east of the park , where groups of counte  --  demonstrators gathered to try to march . The police did not think this was a good idea . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Some of the demonstrators yelled " Death , death , death to the Nazis .

And others shouted : " Asian , Latin , black and white , workers of the world unite , " which also had a bit of a dated ring to it . A girl yelled demands into a hull horn about " decent health , care " and the police " spending millions of dollars to kill workers in Chile . " BACK ALONG 71st Street at Western Avenue , two huge men , one in a " White Power " T-shirt , swaggered past a White Castle . Inside they saw a woman . " See that Jew . We ought to cut her throat , " said T-shirt . Several local boys standing otitside ? with a woman laughed . She told them to be , careful . " You do n't know who you can trust , " she said , eyeing a reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed Christ . " The two toughs flexed their muscles al the corner , then went down 71st to stand ' outside a bar , where they flexed some more . Two sightseers asked them to pose for pictures . At Rockwell Hall , the Nazi headquarters , the Nazis were posing in the back parking lot . There were 3 ' Nazis and about 30 photographers . Local youths in their " White Power " T-shirts also posed , presenting a panorama of pim : ples that would make a Clearasil salesman rich . IT WAS IN Marquette Park . near 71st and Sacramento , that the yelling got into high gear . Scattered shouts of "  - -   - -  the Jews " mixed with " Down with the Nazis " as the Nazis set up their sound equipment behind row upon row of police , horses , buses , and trucks , a few feet in front of the men 's room , The yelling increased . " Jews go home , " yelled part of the crowd , " Death , death . . .. chanted the Jewish demonstrators . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a well-dressed man and his wife wearing yellow Stars of David and pained expressions . As a Nazi finally began to speak , a young woman leaned over a police barricade , her face contorted . " Death , " she screamed over and oiler , " Death , " IN ANOTHER area , where moat of the yelling occurred , a red-haired Jewish kid , an older Jewish man , and a group of youths stood and yelled at each other . " Parasites . Hebes . Kikes , " yelled the youths . " There are no niggers in your schools , " shouted one . " You 're provoking us , " shouted another , " You 're the ones calling us every obscenity , " said the red-haired kid . " I never saw so many Hebes before , " yelled a youth . " Everyone should just go right in and get ' em . " " Six million more , " yelled another . " That shows your intelligence , " yelled the red-haired kid . " Communists , " yelled the youths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the older man . He looked at one youth in an Army jacket . " How long were you in the Army ? " he asked , The kid , who was about 19 , said , " Twenty years , " " I was in four years and I fought for this , " said the older man . " This time make sure , " yelled a passing tough . The red-haired kid decided to get cute , " The blacks are going to come and take Marquette Park over , " he said . A woman nearby became hysterical , " You 're the ones behind it all , " she screamed . INDEED , SOME of the hatred of Jews seemed to be because the local people blamed them for the blockbusting of their old neighborhoods . All though the park , and later on the street , local residents said they did n't like Jews because " The flingers are their fault " The red-haired kid kept at it . " They 're gon na be in your back yard , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled the youths . " Bunch of hook-noses . Why are n't you wearing your beanies ? " yelled some other youths . They stopped yelling that to yell " Sieg hell . " Then they became distracted from the red-haired kid when they noticed a black , about the only one in the park except for some of the police and a few black newsmen . A plainclothes policeman noticed him , too . " My God , is that guy crazy ? " he said . Immediately , several police materialized around him . The black did not seem to care . He carried a folding spectator 's stool like the ones the English use at Ascot . A JEWISH WOMAN appeared to he near tears as she listened to the yelling . " The Germans took my younger brother , " she said . " They took him , and I just cried . Now I do not have to cry . I can help myself , " She still looked like she was about to cry . By now no one had any Idea if the Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd swirled in front of the police barricades . " Jews . . . gas chambers . kill , " rose from the groups . Then the police would suddenly be there , and that confrontation would disappear as the youths ran after their masted buddy . AFTER SEVERAL skirmishes , watched by a man singing " My country ' tin of thee , sweet land of liberty .. ? " the crowd began to disperse . But many gathered at the corner of 71st and Sacramento . There the local youths tried to brag to their friends about how they fought with Jews and kicked blacks and were only prevented from really doing their stuff by the police . As the crowd yelled , " Roast ' em like pigs , " a group of Jewish youths wearing skullcaps stood at the corner , protected by police who finally took them out of the area in a police wagon . And then the crowd again moved on , along 71st Street , looking for action . " Let 's go bust some heads , " said a big kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go down , he 'll go down with me . " Then he looked around for a place to throw his root beer can . He explained to his friends : " I do n't want to litter . "
