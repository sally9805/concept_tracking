When Rome fell , vacations and the tourist trade went into a slump that lasted in Western Europe for a thousand years . The medieval traveler making his way from one feudal barony to another navigated in hostile passages , always uncertain of refuge , as if a gargoyle Karl Maiden flapped after him , haunting him with visions of disaster . Some people setting off on vacation this season must believe that they have now arrived at a 20th century equivalent : a late Sunday afternoon on the American open road , the long procession of gas stations relentlessly shut down and the gauge 's needle sinking like the setting sun toward Empty . If at last a gas line appears , winding up the road a quarter of a mile to an oasis of heraldic light , the effect is surreal : the machines in their idling file give off an almost animal heat , the drivers waiting inside them feeling anxious , vaguely betrayed ( by Detroit , Carter , Schlesinger , OPEC , history ) and sometimes alarmingly close to the Hobbesian state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated the new Middle Ages . But a skittish uncertainty about fuel , along with other factors like the stand-down of the DC-10 fleet and the way that dollars shrivel like cheap bacon when they go abroad , has begun to work changes in the way that Americans are approaching their annual ceremonies of leisure . Many vacations this year are being curtailed , especially the traditional summer trips that Americans en masse have taken since the early ' 50s-the long cross-country excursion by car . Now , having glimpsed the mortality of the machine , many Americans are planning trips no more than a tankful of gas away from their homes . <P> Travelers are still waiting to see if the inconvenience of the gas lines is going to disappear or grow worse . In the meantime , some are beginning to wonder a little whether the whole idea of the vacation-an institution sacrosanct in American habit-makes much sense . <P> The precise point of vacations is elusive-theoretically , anyway . Arnold Toynbee called the creative use of leisure " the mainspring of civilization . " That sort of high-mindedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacations tend to divide into the active and the settled . Some wish to be invigorated , even chafed ; they run down Deliverance rivers in canoes or else try to explore exotic civilizations ( if they can pay the fare ) . The vacation-as-quest can have wonderful epiphanies . In 1939 the novelist Lawrence Durrell wrote to friends from Greece ( for him an ancient world newly found ) : " The country is so still and wild ; valleys unbelievably remote and pure . . . if ever there were valleys and enchanted places where the charm still holds good , it is here . " <P> The difference between the active and the settled vacation is that the first often contains some stimulation of danger ( however small or large ) and the second is designed precisely to soothe , to eliminate threat . It is possible that those who do a certain amount of professional gang fighting tend to favor the settled vacation , while more regimented workers may prefer the adventurous vacation . But temperament is probably a more decisive factor . The most obvious purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pace .
