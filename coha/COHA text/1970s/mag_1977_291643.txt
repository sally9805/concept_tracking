THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHAUCER <P> by JOHN GARDNER <P> 328 pages . Knopf. $12.50 . <P> As a born teacher will do when he is peddling a beloved subject that is thought to be impenetrable , Novelist and Medievalist John Gardner clowns a bit in this amiable biography of Chaucer . He includes a faker 's guide to the pronunciation of Middle English , to which , after a discourse on the swampy places to be avoided in negotiating the letter e , he adds , " If this is too confusing , try to follow , in general , the pronunciation of the Cisco Kid : ' Boot hombray , thees ees nut yoor peesstol . ' " <P> Although his manner is easy , Gardner has not written a slight book . He succeeds in counteracting the popular supposition that the medieval period was excessively religious and dull . As he demonstrates , the age was worldly , tumultuous and as bloody as could be wished . And Chaucer , who was born in about 1340 , spent his life at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , much lost . He was a vintner 's son who rose ( through cleverness and , no doubt , the ability to entertain highborn ladies with after-dinner recitals ) to become a government official , courtier and diplomat under three successive monarchs - Edward II , Edward III and Richard II . He was at least briefly a soldier , and while fighting in France under the Black Prince , he was captured , then ransomed for 16 . The smallness of this sum is a favorite joke among Chaucerians , but it amounts to $3,840 in modern terms , by Gardner 's computation , and probably was only part of the ransom paid . In a time of famine , plague , constant war , baronial feuding and serious peasant uprisings , the poet lived to be nearly 60 - which was old in the 14th century - and died peacefully . <P> For what is lost - details of Chaucer 's personal history , shadings of his personality - Gardner relies on scholarly guesses and novelistic license . After all , he teaches medieval literature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunlight Dialogues and October Light , is one of the most enterprising American novelists of the ' 70s . <P> He infers , largely from Chaucer 's poetry , that the author of The Canterbury Tales was shrewd , playful , funny , a mocker , but even-tempered , a religious man capable of what Gardner slyly calls " willing suspension of belief . " Though the poet , as a matter of convention , denied all personal knowledge of love , his love poetry was strongly sexual . <P> Underlying Chaucer 's sturdy , balanced genius , Gardner sees a characteristically medieval conviction that the world made sense . Chaucer viewed man as a " responsible , moral agent in a baffling but orderly universe . " Yet his finest work was full of ironical laughter ; a " canterbury tale , " in medieval slang , was a lie . <P> Readers of The Life and Times may find themselves hooked on Chaucer . For those who do , Gardner has thoughtfully and simultaneously provided a sterner volume of criticism : The Poetry of Chaucer ( 408 pages ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skow
