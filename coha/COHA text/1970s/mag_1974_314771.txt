Nestled among the cotton and soybean fields of Mississippi 's table-flat Bolivar County , the tiny ( pop . 2,100 ) all black city of Mound Bayou has few stores , little in the way of employment , and even less for the diversion of its residents . But Mound Bayou does have one civic asset : the Delta Community Hospital and Health Center Inc. , a black-run medical complex that provides the people of Bolivar and neighboring counties with first-rate health care regardless of their ability to pay . Mound Bayou may not have its prized institution much longer . The federal aid necessary to keep the hospital going will end early next year , and unless some other sources of support can be found , the hospital may be forced to turn away patients , most of whom have nowhere else to go . <P> Mound Bayou 's community hospital owes its existence to P.M. Smith , head of a black fraternal organization called the International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor . Appalled by the primitive and inadequate hospital facilities for blacks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his organization 's temples to build the Mound Bayou hospital in 1942 . <P> For more than two decades , the fraternal order was the chief backer of the hospital . But then Mound Bayou got some help from Washington . In 1967 the Office of Economic Opportunity gave Tufts University funds to establish a community health center half a mile from the hospital . The center began referring its patients to the institution , and by 1972 more than $5.5 million worth of OEO funds , mainly in salaries , were being put into the area 's faltering economy . <P> Death Rate . The health dividends from the federal investment were even greater . Delta blacks had long been plagued by many poverty-related ailments , from iron-deficiency anemia to parasitic infections like hookworm . The hospital alone could not significantly reduce the incidence of these ailments , but it did help those who came to it . Although the death rate for babies born in the region is more than 35 per 1,000 live births ( among the nation 's highest ) , there were only five deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's community hospital . <P> White politicians paid little attention to Mound Bayou 's hospital while it was struggling along on its own . Once the hospital and medical center began receiving regular federal funds , they became interested . Local officials tried to take over the Mound Bayou program - and its funding-but failed . State agencies attempted to rescind the hospital 's license on the ground that it failed to meet state standards . They were stymied when Mound Bayou obtained OEO funds to renovate some of its most outmoded facilities . <P> Mound Bayou 's latest trials began in 1973 , when the Nixon Administration dismantled OEO and transferred its health-services program to the Department of Health , Education and Welfare , which lacks the statutory authority to finance the hospital . HEW will continue to fund the outpatient programs conducted at Mound Bayou 's health center . But the money to support the hospital is being cut off . By next June , all financial aid will end .                    @
