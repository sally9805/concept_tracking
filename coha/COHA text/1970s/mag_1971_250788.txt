We think the realities of the world require that both Peking and Taipei be represented . One represents 700 million to 800 million people . In Taiwan there are 14 million or more people . And we think both should be represented in the United Nations . <P> EVEN though it was no great surprise , Secretary of State William Rogers ' formal announcement that the U.S. would actively support Peking 's admission to the U.N . this fall was a milestone , reversing a policy that had endured since the first attempt to seat the mainland Communist regime 21 years ago . <P> The new U.S. policy was attacked by both Chinas , since each claims to be the sole and rightful representative of all of China 's people . But that did not deter the Administration . As President Nixon told reporters in the Oval Office after returning from a swing through Iowa and Ohio , China must be regarded not only as " the most populous nation in the world , * but one which potentially in the future could become the most powerful nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-China " policy , Mao Tse-tung 's regime may ultimately enter the U.N . on its own terms-as the one and only Chinese delegation . There is in fact only one seat marked " China " at the U.N . The U.S. effort to seat two delegations in the U.N . ' s Manhattan headquarters ( see box , page 25 ) will involve an effort to sidestep a fundamental issue of representation-if Peking takes the China seat , whom does Taipei represent ? The strategy may not work ; in truth , the U.S. might be relieved of some sticky diplomatic problems if it fails and Taipei is expelled . But the Administration rejects suggestions that its effort to keep Taipei in the U.N . might be less than wholehearted . " We are going all out , " said George Bush , U.S. Ambassador to the U.N . " It 's going to be difficult , but we believe we have a chance . " <P> Desultory Demonstrations . Though the new U.S. policy put Chiang Kai-shek 's Nationalist regime at a decided disadvantage . Taipei was outwardly calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight for Taipei 's " lawful rights and position " in the U.N. , and warned that the organization could " drift into impotence and total failure " if Peking is admitted . <P> In Taipei , where there had been some desultory demonstrations earlier , the Rogers announcement was received calmly . A few red , yellow and green posters urging the world to SAVE THE U.N. , BLOCK THE COMMUNISTS ' ENTRY appeared on downtown walls . The foreign ministry organized regional conferences of its diplomats in Asia , Africa and Latin America in preparation for a new diplomatic offensive . The chances that such an offensive will succeed are slim indeed . Only last week , Turkey became the eighth NATO member ( of 15 ) to recognize Peking and sever relations with Taipei , and Greece may soon follow suit . With reason , the Nationalists are increasingly fretful about diplomatic isolation , and they are no longer summarily breaking relations with governments that recognize Peking .                    @
