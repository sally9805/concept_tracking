Not exactly the dog days of August in the Big Apple <P> To thousands of ordinary New Yorkers , the biggest problem afoot has been not fiscal but fecal . Unlike New York City 's money troubles , the spread of dog excrement on the streets and parks long seemed insoluble and irreversible . Last week , after years of fruitless public clamor for an ordinance to ban canine littering , a state law went into effect that would levy a $25 fine on dog owners who let their pets defecate in any public area without cleaning up the act ; the law applies to cities of more than 400,000 . In New York City , 2,500 municipal workers , from cops to sanitation men , were authorized to issue summonses to any citizen failing to pick up after his pet . <P> Though most New Yorkers ' initial reaction was that the law is probably unenforceable , retailers reported brisk sales of sanitary devices ranging from 15 disposable cardboard shovels to $11 long-handled pooper scoopers equipped with a flashlight for nocturnal emitters .

On the first day of the law , only 22 litter tickets were issued ; yet to close observers of sidewalks and parks , there was a marked diminution in dog litter and lots of owners were carrying bags . This may only be temporary . A few cities , notably Chicago and Boston , have had some success with similar ordinances . Other cities have not . <P> Seizing on a story with , so to speak , grass-roots appeal , some metropolitan newspapers and broadcasters devoted more space and time to the cleanup issue last week , than they did to the terrorist attack at the Iraqi embassy in Paris or anything going on in Congress . The New York Post banner headlined a front-page story , CITY DOG OWNERS DOING THEIR DUTY . The Daily News ran daily features on " poopetrators , " concluding in one headline , ON THE FIRST DOG DAY MORNING , CRIME IS DROPPING . The New York Times editorialized that it was " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attitude can make a difference . " <P> Radio stations in Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore produced solemn coverage of the canine crisis in New York . The situation even merited a full 2 minutes on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite . Whether they played it funny or somber , it was a trying topic for newswriters faced with the basic problem of finding bowdlerisms for two very basic four-letter words . <P> As with most other urban headaches , the problem is more serious in New York than in any other community . The city 's estimated 1.4 million dogs dump some 125 tons of feces daily-not to mention 100,000 gal . of urine . This is not merely an aesthetic and emotional issue between dog owners and doo-dodgers , but a matter of health as well , since the minute roundworm eggs excreted by many dogs can be transmitted to humans , particularly children , and can ultimately affect the kidneys , liver , lungs , brain and eyes .                @ @ @ @ @
