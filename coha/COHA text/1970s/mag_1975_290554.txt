The wildcat strike , a revolt against badly bollixed grievance procedures , spread swiftly . Within 16 days almost all 50,000 soft-coal miners in West Virginia walked off the job . The mine owners went to court , and Federal Judge Kenneth K. Hall slapped the United Mine Workers with a gigantic $500,000 fine , plus $100,000 a day for as long as the strike lasted . Last week , seven working days and $1.2 million later , most of the wildcatters went back to work . <P> In recent years , no-strike clauses that ban walkouts have been written into most labor contracts , including those covering the West Virginia mines . Trouble is , when some workers strike without authorization , union officials often shrug ( some critics say wink ) and claim they are not responsible . Judge Hall did not buy that approach . Rapping the U.M.W. for its " feeble " efforts to halt the walkout , Hall made the fine heavy to force quick action . U.M.W. President Arnold Miller and other union leaders responded by working feverishly to get the miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only six weeks ago the Third Circuit Court of Appeals handed down an important precedent in the case of two Teamsters locals in Warren , Ohio , and Pittsburgh . The truckers had walked out in a bloody , five-week wildcat strike against Eazor Express Inc. over the dismissal of two employees . Eazor sued the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the locals , all of which had signed a no-strike agreement , and three judges of the Third Circuit unanimously held them all liable , even though they were not involved in starting the strike . The court 's message was clear : when a contract contains a no-strike clause , a union must take every measure reasonably possible to pressure strikers back to work . <P> For their part , U.M.W. lawyers will now appeal the union 's fine , which Hall reduced to $700,000 after the strike 's end . Whatever the final outcome , Judge Hall 's success in taming the wildcatters should help to cool the ardor of restive workers whose union contract happens to contain a no-strike clause .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
