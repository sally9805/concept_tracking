txt After five years of waiting and hoping , many of New York 's elected officials are turning away from psychotherapy as a way to treat heroin addicts and are relying instead on chemistry . Although they have not said so publicly and continue to spend great sums of money for psychotherapy , they now are treating more and more people with methadone , the mainstay of the chemical , or chemotherapeutic , approach . Methadone , an addictive drug made in the laboratory , is similar in chemical structure to heroin . Doctors have reported that it blocks the effects of heroin in many addicts . Methadone-dispensing programs in New York and elsewhere have reported encouraging results in getting addicts to stop taking heroin regularly . But despite their claims of success , there is a continuing controversy as to how and when methadone should be used and even as to whether it works at all . But controversy notwithstanding , the pattern of commitment to it is quite clear . The Lindsay administration has asked the Rockefeller administration to provide enough funds to quadruple the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rockefeller administration , which declared an all-out attack on addiction in 1966 , already has spent $22-million on methadone and will spend $24.9-million more this year , if the Legislature approves . The Governor proposes to spend nearly three times that amount  --  about $80-million  --  for in-residence treatment programs that attempt // to treat the possible psychologi ? cal causes of addiction , But the dollar figure ( done does not tell the story of the methadone commitment , since residential treatment centers are much more expensive to operate on a yearly basis than methadone programs . In terms of people , meths ? done is clearly on its way to becoming dominant . There are now about 7,000 on methadone in New York State . The state hopes that by the end of the year there will be 15,000 to 17,000 . About 16,000 people in the state are now under some sort of psychotherapeutic treatment , and the state estimates that there will be virtually no change in that number by the end of the year . If the trend continues as ex. pected , methadone users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 , Combining Two Methods Methadone and psychothe ? apy are not incompatible . However , they do not occur together with great frequency , both because of the expense involved in providing psychotherapy and because in the past , at least , advocates of methadone treatment did not really believe psychotherapy was necessary . They felt it was more important to help addicts with such pragmatic problems as getting jobs or coping with legal difficulties . In some programs  --  such as those in New Orleans , for example  --  there are no supportive services , psychiatric or otherwise . The priorities now given to methadene treatment in New York are seen by many as a decisive downgrading of psyehotherapy . " The state commission and the city , in switching all their attention to methadone , are following the law  --  and-order approach and saying ' the hell with the addicts , " says Dr. Richard Taylor , executive director Of the Association of Voluntary Agencies on Nan cotics Treatment . Within his organization are some of the major , private in-patient , psychiatric - oriented treatment houses Daytop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current lack of standing among many elected officials is understandable . The rehabilitation houses ? public and , private ? have been unable to produce any generally accepted data on achievements and knowledge gained . Some of the people who run the treatment programs have spent the last five years criticizing each other . And perhaps the most important obstacle in gaining ' Stature is that psychotherapy is a long , expensive process . Some psychiatrists think psychiatry can not " cure " addicts and others feel it will take many more'years to determine which approaches work . Meanwhile , fear of addictrelated crime continues to mount , and so do the bills  --  the state has spent more than $200-million for the inpatient treatment of addicts . Questions Being Posed But as the commitment slowly unfolds in financial requests , not just for methadone but also for research in other antiheroin chemical agents as well , those concerned with the future are asking : What does it mean when society admits it can not cope with the root causes of addiction , when it can not even agree on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects heroin has on the body ? They also are raising these serious questions : Who should get methadone ? What should the pace of methadone-dispensing efforts he ? What effect will it all have on the city 's immense addict ? related crime problem ? Even some of those who are convinced that psychiatry has only a minor role wonder at the ethics of giving methadone to adolescents , And they wonder , too , if methadone will ultimately prove to be just another link in the disastrous chain of events that began 80 years ago when morphine was given to alcoholics to get them to stop drinking . " Opium is less inimical to healthy life than alcohol , " wrote Dr. J. R. Black in The Cincinnati Lancet-Clinic in 1889 . He added that it " calms in place of exciting the baser passions , and hence is less pro- ductive of acts of violence and crime ; in short , the use of morphine in place of alcohol is but a choice of evils , and by far the lesser . " Only a few years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their habit . Most physicians have ' higher expectations for methadone , but they know they have been wrong before . There are also questions as to how many addicts will voluntarily take methadone and what should be done if substantial numbers refuse . As a result , some people want to pursue the chemical approach to its final alternative and give heroin to the addicts who want it . For several months , members of Mayor Lindsay 's Narcotic Control Council have been studying the feasibility of such a move but they have not yet reported on their findings . Proponents of dispensing heroin generally despair of a cure 's ever being found and reason that free heroin will take the profit out of the black market and thus greatly reduce the need for addicts to steal , The British dispensed heroin to addicts for nearly 50 years . Many physicians there feel that in its early stages , it did help to reduce stealing and encouraged addicts to remain in society . In the last few years , however , some British physicians have found that the new breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Max Glatt , a London authority who used to prescribe heroin but now refuses to , estimates that 90 per cent of British addicts sell drugs to supplement their welfare payments . Although the British problem remains tiny compared with America 's , it has grown and diversified itself into many drugs . The British are switching over to methadone , and new addicts find it difficult , if not impossible , to get heroin at Government clinics . But even as the British abandon the prescribing of heroin , some elected officials , desperate for quick solutions , remain hopeful that it could work here . One of these is State Senator Robert Garcia , whose 29th District encompasses Hunts Point and the South Bronx , two of the worst neighborhoods for heroin addiction in New York City . " The people in my district have had it , " he said recently . " Junkies are robbing them in the streets in broad daylight . We need some action and we need it now . " Senator Garcia says " we ought to give them the drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be administered . Although elected officials representing Negro and Puerto Rican neighborhoods are under increasing pressure from their constituents to do something about the drug problem , the idea of giving heroin or any other chemical to addicts has long been viewed with suspicion by the younger , more miltent residents of those communities . Some militants see the legalization of heroin as a means to keep blacks and Puerto Ricans under sedation . Some see methadone as a means by which the larger community can manipulate minority groups . However , many of the fears about methadone have eased in the last year or two , although many blacks continue to hope that methadone will be a transitional drug and that eventually , those who take it will ? if given enough support ? achieve drug freedom . Within the quandary lie the frequently unspoken reasons as to why society is prepared to commit great sums for the chemical treatment of addicts but only modest amounts to help the alcoholic , The New York Council on Alcoholism believes there are at least 700,000 alcoholics in the state ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 addicts in New York , or more than 9Q per cent of the addicts in the state . Dr. Michael Baden , the city 's deputy chief medical examiner , reports there were mom than 1,200 deaths related to narcotics use last year and about 6,000 related to use of alcohol . Yet the $3.5-million the state plans to spend this year for alcoholism is less than 3 per cent of its budget for addict rehabilitation . Referring to the idea that narcotics are more often associated with crime than alcohol , Graham S. Finney , commissioner of the city 's Addiction Services Agency , said of the funds used to fight drug abuse : " I would doubt there would be this vast expenditure if it were not for the criminality associated with it . " In a series of interviews by The New York Times since last June , physicians and other professionals in the drug treatment field as well as public officials were questioned to determine the promise , , accomplishments and shortcomings of chemotherapy . There was much disagreement and rivalry among the experts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the interviews or from an examination of research papers . Among the findings of the study were these : ' Although methadone dominates chemotherapy now , some physicians are pushing research projects to find other alternative chemicals . For example , the state 's Narcotic Addiction Control Commission has spent more than $1-million for research on two drugs that some doctors think have the potential for immunizing thousands of children against heroin addiction in neighborhoods where it is most bound to occur . The drugs are called Cyclacozine arid Naloxone , and they are , in a group called " antagonists . " The theory is that they form barriers around the cells of the body and thus make heroin ineffective . At present , Food and Drug Research Laboratories , Inc. , of Maspeth , Queens , is attempting to develop a silicone rubber substance that could be used as a vehicle for antagonist drugs in the body . The company has a $66,340 contract awarded by New York Medical College , which received the money from the state commission . Dr. Alfred Freedman and Dr. Max Fink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for experimental use on humans by the end of the year . Unlike methadone , the antagonists are nonaddictive , but the medical profession generally remains skeptical ; results from use of the antagonists given on a daily basis have been unimpressive . " Methadone is far from satisfactory , " says Dr. Jerome Jaffe of Chicago , " and antagonists offer an alternative . But right now , they are more a promise than a reality . " Dr. Herbert Kleber of Yale points out that " anxiety , depression and hallucinations result at some dosage levels , ? ' and that , like methadone , Naloxone and Cyclacozine block only the effects of the opiates heroin and morphine at a time when Americans tend to abuse a wide variety of drugs , many of them not opiates . There is a sharp dispute over whether methadone should be used with adolescents . Dr. Marie Nyswander of the Rockefeller University and a group of physicians at Johns Hopkins Medical School are both engaged in experimental programs giving methadone to addicts younger than 18 . While the physicians at Johns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial at detoxification , " they believe that " failure at detoxification should not be a prerequisite for entrance to a maintainance program . " But Florence M. Kelley , administrative judge of the city 's Family Court , feels the teenagers should always be exposed to other treatment techniques before methadone is given . She calls methadone use with the young her " deepest concern . " liResearchers disagree as to how much of a role methadone plays in reducing criminality . The methadone-dispensing programs operated by'Beth Israel Hospital in Now York and by Dr. Robert L. DuPont in Washington have reported overwhelming success in getting heroin addicts to remain on methodone and take . at least the initial steps to end the Predatory behavior that causes society to loathe addicts . Last fall , Dr. DuPont , reported an 83 per cent , drop in arrests . among 150 heroin addicts studied who entered and stayed With his . program . ( His program expects to be treating 5,000 by the end of this year ) . Says Dr. Richard Phillipson of the National Institute of Mental Health 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult , if not impossible , to find today , when some methadone maintenance programs have been in operation for over five years , any really hard data to support the claims of a reduction in criminality . " Since last summer , many of the methadone programs in New York have accelerated their induction of addicts . The 7,000 now taking methadone in New York State are not enough to have much of the effect on the addict-related How . Heroin and Methadone Differ deleted 40 lines crime problem . And according to figures released by the state , less than a quarter of the city 's 100.000 addicts are receiving any treatment , In Hunts Point , South Bronx and Bedford-Stuyvesant and on the Lower East Side , people remain desperate about crime and they talk of drastic action . A year and a half ago , a insistence for an immediate solution . Among harried residents of New York , there appears to be little enthusiasm for determining how and why people became addicted . But Dr. Vincent Dole , one of the principal developers of methadone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should now be an important priority for society . " The fallacy is that psychotherapy , counseling and socalled education schemes can cure addiction , " he says . " You can give counseling but you still have to treat his pharmacological need . And if you do this , you can use those laty services to help him . " I think that one of the most important motivations now is to analyze the processes that led adolescents into this mess . " ' But a resident of the Lower East Side who was interviewed recently seemed to have little interest in the basic causes of addiction or in the humane treatment of addicts . " I would n't care if someone came along with a machine gun and killed all of them , " he said . " I 've been robbed , my wife has been robbed ? I 'm sorry , but I just do n't care any more . " And so it appears that of necessity , the approach has become one of saturation and satiation . A psychiatric social worker put it this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , you can give them methadone . If you are considering why they became addicted and you want to help them make their lives more productive , then you have to do something else . " But you look around and you wonder if you should n't get people off the streets before the city is destroyed . "
