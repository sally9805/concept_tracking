txt Dean Burch , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , emphasized today that the agency 's order requiring the television networks to give prime-time exposure to critics of the Administration 's policy in Vietnam was not a grant of " equal time " to match President Nixon 's appearances . Mr. Burch said that at least six newspapers and The Associated Press had reported the decision incorrectly as being " anti-Nixon " or involving " equal time . " He said The New York Times , Newsweek and Time magazine had misconstrued the ruling in other respects . White House officials , distressed at the suggestion in first reports that the F.C.C. decision would inhibit the President 's use of television , worked over the weekend with Mr. Burch 's personal ' staff in followup briefings with reporters . The White House expects that the President will still enjoy a favorable balance of TV time , these officials said , and the grant of limited reply time will not discourage Mr. Nixon from using the medium as heavily in the future as he has in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago to head the seven-member F.C.C. , issued a statement this afternoon to " clear up " the decision , which was first announced in an agency press release last Friday . While the mandatory exposure of opposition spokesman was designed to balance Mr. Nixon 's five addresses on Vietnam and Cambodia , Mr. Burch said , the F.C.C. had not specified equal time or , in fact , any amount ? of time that the other side should get . Further , he said , " we have expressly rejected any principle embodying right of reply or rebuttal to the President . " The decision did not relate essentially to Mr. Nixon or the Presidency , Mr. Burch said , but to the " issue " of Indochina . Television 's coverage of that issue was " roughly balanced , " the commission found , except for " the five opportunities in prime time for the leading spokesman ( the President ) of one side to address the nation on this issue . " Mr. Burch 's statement continued , " In such circumstances , time should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate spokesman for the other viewpoint . " " Our ruling , " he emphasized , " was not intended to discourage in any way the networks ' presentation of Presidential reports to the nation . We recognize their importance to an informed public opinion as do the networks . " In reporting the ruling in its issue of Saturday , Aug. 15 , The New York Times stated : " The Federal Communicaions Commission said today that President Nixon had , made such extensive use of television to defend his conduct of the war in Indochina that the networks must now give opponents a chance to present critical replies on prime time . " The requirement that broadcasters not simply cover the other side but give uninterrupted , premium exposure to the President 's opponents was the first of its kind and appeared likely to alter Mr. Nixon 's use of the medium . " Mr. Burch quoted those two paragraphs in his statement today and commented : " First of all , the F.C.C. did not say what The Times states it said . Secondly , the commission was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was not engrafting an equal opportunities requirement in a fairness area and as pointed out above , the commission carefully avoided any suggestion that the Presidential reports to the nation be discouraged . " The- Times 's report had specified that " the F.C.C. declared that it was not creating an automatic right of reply to any Presidential broadcast . " The report also noted that the decision was drawn under the general " fairness " doctrine rather than under the " equal opportunities " or " equal time " rule that applies strictly to political candidates . " Mr. Burch said that a number of papers had wrongly reported the ruling as involving " equal time " and heir ) * " antiNixon . " He mentioned , in those categories The Christian Science Monitor , Chicago Today , The Washington Star , The Chicago Sun-Times , The Boston Globe , The St. Paul Pioneer Press , The Associated Press and The National Observer . Newsweek 's conclusion that the decision established " a new fairness doctrine " and Time 's speculation on " radically changed Presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
