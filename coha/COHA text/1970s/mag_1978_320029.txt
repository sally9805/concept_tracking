Like a Scene from Dante , the night sky south of Villahermosa is filled with a fiery glow . It comes from great gouts of flame that flare off natural gas from scores of wells dotting the steamy marshes , scrubs and jungles of the aptly named state of Tabasco in southeast Mexico . Every day , 300 million cu . ft. of gas , enough to supply the energy needs of Vermont for a month , are simply burned off , in part , because the U.S. Government refuses to pay the price that Mexico demands . The huge gas supply and the appalling waste are symbolic of the future promise and present uncertainty of Mexico 's growing oil and gas discoveries , findings that are propelling the poor but potentially mighty neighbor across the river into the world of petropower and intrigue . <P> Interest in Mexico 's energy wealth reached fever pitch last month , when Pemex , the government monopoly , revealed the latest strike in the Chicontepec field near the Gulf Coast city of Tampico . Pemex Chief Jorge Diaz Serrano estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and gas to more than 200 billion bbl . <P> In the dizzying realm of oil statistics , that rough estimate requires major qualification . Reserves are measured in three ways : proven , probable and potential . Unlike other countries , Mexico further complicates matters by lumping oil and gas together ; about two-thirds are oil , one-third gas . The government figures its proven reserves-oil and gas that can be recovered with existing technology at current prices-at 20 billion bbl . This total is expected to be raised soon to about 30 billion bbl. , which would make Mexico 's known supplies of oil slightly larger than those of Venezuela or Nigeria , though far smaller than Saudi Arabia 's 160 billion bbl . The official reckoning of the much less certain probable reserves , which might be retrieved from fields already discovered but not fully explored or developed , is about 37 billion bbl . Potential reserve estimates , like those used for the Chicontepec field , cover all the oil that might be in the field whether or not it is recoverable . <P> No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mexicans , millions of who live in poverty . Pemex hopes to lift production from its present 1.5 million bbl. a day to 2.5 million by 1980 . At the same time , it expects to triple its oil exports to 1 million bbl. a day , mainly to the U.S. ( whose total imports now are 9.1 million bbl . ) . As a result , oil earnings are expected to hit $8 billion annually by 1980 . <P> The Mexican finds are significant but hardly a complete solution to future energy shortages . At best , oil from Mexico would put off the projected fuel crunch from the late 1980s to the early 1990s . But together with other potential big fields-in China , Iraq , Canada , South America , Alaska and elsewhere-the new bonanza in Mexico could enable the world to scrape by into the 21st century , by which time energy from alternative sources may be widely available .
