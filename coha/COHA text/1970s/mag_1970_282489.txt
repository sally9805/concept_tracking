Soon after a jetliner takes off , the pilot jettisons about three gallons of kerosene . This is excess fuel left in " holding tanks " from the engines ' last run . Airline officials insist that the kerosene vaporizes in the atmosphere and does not return to earth . But Eastern Airlines Captain William L. Guthrie , 58 , disagrees-and has lost his job as a result . <P> A $37,000-a-year pilot with 30 years of flying experience , Guthrie says that the dumped fuel either falls on the runway , where it can become a " greasy and slippery " hazard for other aircraft , or else it contributes to airport smog that is " often so thick you ca n't see the earth horizon . " One of Guthrie 's friends crashed in such murk in 1962 . <P> In a solo crusade for a cleaner blue yonder , Guthrie routinely ordered mechanics to drain his holding tanks by hand before takeoffs . He says the process should take from three to five minutes . But Eastern told the mechanics not to obey him- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , " said a company official-and flights were delayed by as much as 98 minutes until the captain got his way . The conflict of wills was resolved two weeks ago when the airline fired the veteran pilot . <P> Last week Guthrie 's 3,700 fellow Eastern pilots intimated that they , too , will drain holding tanks on the ground unless Guthrie gets his wings back . Meanwhile , Eastern announced that it had asked manufacturers to try to design a quieter , almost pollution-free engine in which excess fuel would seep back into the regular fuel tanks .
