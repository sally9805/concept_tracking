txt The Apollo 14 astronauts coasted closer to the moon today , quietly relaxing aboard a spacecraft pronounced sound for the nation 's third manned ' lunar landing early Friday.1 Their aim was only a few miles off target . But that could be corrected , if necessary , with another firing of the spacecraft 's main rocket . Their health was said to be excellent . They have taken no medication since liftoff , not even the sleeping or motionsickness pills that other crews found necessary . The crew , Capt . Alan B. Shepard Jr . and Comdr . Edgar D. Mitchell of the Navy and Maj. Stewart A. Roosa of the Air Force . reported seeing brief flashes of light yesterday when their spacecraft was dark . Presumably these were cosmic rays , a phenomenon previous Apollo crews have observed . Docking System Working They still did not understand their earlier difficulties in linking the Apollo 14 command ship with its lunar landing craft . But flight controllers assured the crew that the docking system " is now working normally . " And so were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command ship and lunar module , docked nose to upper hatch  --  as Apollo 14 passed the 205,000-mile mark of its outward journey . It was at that point in the Apollo 13 mission last April that the oxygen tank erupted , cutting off the spaceship 's oxygen , water and electricity supply and forcing the crew to abort all lunar-landing plans . The Apollo 14 crew plans to make an inspection tour of the lunar module today . They will transmit a 45-minute telecast of the vehicle 's interior to Mission Control here . If the landing is found to be // in good working order , Apo1101 14 is to proceed with its plan to go into lunar orbit at 2:01 A.M. Eastern standard time tomorrow . Adjustments made in the Apollo 's trajectory will have enabled the astronauts to make up all of the 40 minutes lost by the delay in launching from Cape Kennedy , Fla. , Sunday afternoon . These adjustments included fine changes in the velocity and flight direction when Apollo 14 rocketed out of low earth orbit Sunday and when its spacecraft engine fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orbit To go into lunar orbit , the spaceship will swing around the moon 's Pleading edge to a point at the 180-degree meridian behind the moon . The astronauts would then fire the main rocket to slow down ' enough to be captured by the moon 's gravity . Shortly ' afterward , while Apollo 14 is still behind the moon , the third stage of the Saturn 5 rocket is supposed to crash onto the lunar surface . The empty rocket is on a course that would take it to an impact south of the seismometer left by the Apollo 12 astronauts on the Ocean of Storms . Seismic waves from the impact should give scientists new information on the moon 's interior . During their moonward voyage , the astronauts are sleeping when it is daytime in the United States and working during the night . Such a sleepwork cycle was required because most of their lunar surface activities are to take place in the early morning hours . For example , the landing is scheduled for 4:16 A.M. Friday and the first moon walk at 8:53 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set for 5:38 A.M. Saturday , with liftoff from the surface coming at 1:47 P.M. the same day . When Apollo 14 was about 155,000 miles from the earth early today , the astronauts began to see some of the details of the lunar surface . The moon was about 110,000 miles from Apollo 14 . Moon ' Like an Orange ' Commander Mitchell said last night that through the spacecraft window the moon " appears about like an orange held just short of arm 's length . " " The moon starts to take on a little bit of brown and grayish colors about this point , " Commander Mitchell continued , " as opposed to being very bright as it appears from the earth , you can start to see a little bit of texture here . " Turning his gaze upon the receding earth , Commander Mitchell , the soft-spoken holder of a doctorate in astronautics , described the view as " magnificent . " " I 'm very glad we have earth as a home planet , " he said . " 1 hope we can keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Roosa reported that they had seen flashes of light before their eyes while the spacecraft was darkened for the sleep period . They saw some flashes , which they described as " subdued , " when they closed their eyes , and some just after awakening . " Unfortunately , we were a little bit too tired to conduct any sort of measured experiment data with them , " Captain Shepard said , " but maybe we can get around to that in the next few days . " Phenomenon of Flashes Scientists would like information on the frequency and regularity of such flashes . They want to determine if the flashes are the result of particles hitting the eyeball itself or of some secondary stimulation . It is too soon to know what effects the radiation , in such doses , will have on the astronauts , the scientists say . The spacecraft is shielded against what would be considered radiation doses harmful in the short term . In one experiment , Major Roosa trained one of the spacecraft 's cameras on the night side of the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially designed for photography of dim light sources . While Captain Shepard and Commander Mitchell are on the lunar surface , Major Roosa is scheduled to take more photographs of dim light sources from lunar orbit . Some of these sources include faintly reflective debris in outer space . Only two matters gave flight controllers Much concern . racking data showed Apollo 14 , after its mid-course correction , to be aiming for a point of closest approach to the moon at a distance of 77 miles  --  about seven miles too far away . A slight two-second rocket firing May be required to adjust the aim . The other concern was over the amount of fuel for the command module 's small maneuvering thrusters . These little rockets ring the spacecraft . Flight controllers reported the fuel level was 30 pounds below what it should be at this point because of the extra maneuvers Major Roosa needed to complete the docking Sunday night . Though the fuel ? level was not considered dangerously low , the astronauts were directed to ? delete some spacecraft stabilizing maneuvers to conserve fuel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
