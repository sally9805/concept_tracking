THE world monetary agreement reached over the weekend concludes only the opening round in the U.S. international economic offensive . The offensive 's Phase II , already under way , is the U.S. attempt to persuade foreign governments to tear down tariffs , quotas and other barriers against American exports of goods and capital . The U.S. was long maddeningly vague on just what trade concessions it wants , but lately it has served up a list of specific demands . They have made the trade talks clearer , but not easier . Unlike the round-table currency negotiations , the trade bargaining consists of a series of bilateral talks with Japan , Canada and the Common Market Six , each involving quite different controversies and prospects for agreement . <P> In U.S. eyes , Japan is the most egregious trade offender . It maintains tariffs up to 25% on some goods , plus tight import quotas and restrictions on foreign investment in many Japanese industries . Last week the U.S. won some minimum concessions from the Japanese , who agreed to cut tariffs on 25 items , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On other demands , the U.S. seemingly got nowhere . The Japanese did say that they would abolish import quotas on light aircraft and on some agricultural products , like refined sugar and bacon , but threatened to raise tariffs on these products . They also rejected a demand that they drop quotas on beef , oranges and fruit juices and refused to permit U.S. investment in Japanese computer manufacturing until 1974 . <P> The U.S. stands a reasonable chance of making more progress when Prime Minister Sato visits President Nixon in San Clemente Jan. 6 and 7 . The Japanese are in an embarrassing situation because they have continued to run huge surpluses in trade with the U.S. despite their howls about America 's ' ' brutal " economic moves . Since the August " Nixon shokku , " ' ' Japanese exports have been running 20% or more above a year earlier , with the biggest increases coming in shipments to the U.S. Sato last week asked the Japanese ministries of finance , agriculture and international trade and industry to prepare lists of the maximum concessions that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto trade pact that limits duty-free shipments of U.S. cars and parts into Canada while allowing Canadian-built cars free access to the U.S. Nixon 's negotiators have also asked Ottawa to loosen restrictions on spending by Canadian tourists in the U.S. Canada has some demands of its own ; it wants , for example , to sell more uranium in the U.S. Canadian Finance Minister Edgar Benson indicates that his nation is in a mood to compromise . " If we are to have good relations with the U.S. , " he says , " we can not continue having irritants between us that do not always make sense . " <P> The Common Market is less tractable , and it is in a strong bargaining position . Its tariffs average less than those of the U.S. ( 6% v. 7% ) , and purchases by its six nations from the U.S. already exceed their sales in the American market by more than $2 billion a year . Nixon last week did win a promise from French President Pompidou that the Common Market will start trade talks with the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
