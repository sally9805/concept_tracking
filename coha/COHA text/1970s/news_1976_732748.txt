txt WHEN DEAN Donald P. Jacobs of Northwestern University 's Grad u at e School of Management went to Washington m the summer of 1974 to attend his second meeting as a member of the board of , Amtrak , he decided , appropriately , to take a train . " It was my first trip on the Broadway Limited , " he said . " I waited for an hour and a. , half in a steaming diner to eat . Everybody around me was complaining bitterly . " I kept my mouth shut . I did n't want anyone to know who I was , " he said , explaining why he did n't demand better service . TWO YEARS HAVE passed shim the incident . Now Jacobs is chairman of the board of the National Railroad Passenger Corp . ( Amtrak and not ashamed to admit it . He presides over an agency which operates 26,000 miles of routes serving 484 American cities with 346 locomotives hauling more than 2,000 cars . " ' Everything I see now is positive , " Jacobs ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a dramatically improving operation . " Most of the scores of Amtrak employes interviewed by The Tribune in the last two months  --  from the general manager of operations to porters and maintenance men  --  agree with him . Others  --  riders , some employes , and politicians  --  are not so sure . Amtrak still has some serious problems : ? The agency has lost $1.8 billion since its inception five years ago , and not one of its routes shows a profit . ? Bad track on some railroads and old equipment have made schedules on many runs unrealistic , and Amtrak officials have been forced to inflate schedules to cope with delays . ? " Political trains " dictated by Congress often serve few riders and are expensive to operate but are retained because Amtrak depends on Capitol Hill to subsidize its deficit each year . ? Sanitation problems on some diners are so s.evere the Food and Drug Administration is considering suing to force improvement . FDA inspectors found mice and vermin roaming on one Broadway Limited diner earlier this year . ? Amtrak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel season . And its officials admit It is hopelessly underequipped to be confronted by another gasoline crisis . AMTRAK HAS other problems . It Is still possible to get terrible meals , surly attendants , and fouled ? up reservations from the agency which was created in 1971 to save America 's failing passenger train Industry . " Our problem is that we do n't have the consistency they have in the airline Industry " sold David A. Watts Jr. , vice president and general manager of operations . " We vary between the good and the bad . " But Watts and Jacobs believe Amtrak is getting better , and there is evidence to support their view . Most important , Amtrak has created a unified railroad network out of an often chaotic system in which every railroad operated its own passenger trains According to its own standards . Some like the Santa Fe Super Chief , were better than what Amtrak operates today . But too often railroads operated dilapidated , aging trains because the Interstate Commerce Commission would not permit dropping the routes . AMTRAK HAS begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one railroad over which It operates to do the same . More than 800 new cars have been delivered or are on order , and new locomotives pull most trains . For the first time there is a nationwide rail reservations system and Amtrak 's timetables are easy to read and include all of its trains . Amtrak also is upgrading its stations , many built in the early 1900s , and borrowing an idea from the aerospace industry has installed microwave kitchens on its new diners . Technology , however , has not helped Amtrak 's trains run any faster . ALTHOUGH AMTRAK 'S new locomotives are capable of operating at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour , the track and signal systems of America 's railroads can not handle those speeds , Amtrak depends upon those railroads to operate its trains . The cost of increasing train speeds may be prohibitive . The Burlington Northern Railroad , far one , estimates it wotel cost $500 million to upgrade the 263-mile line between Chicago and Quincy , nl , to carry trains at 110 miles an .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I do n't think it is fair to ask the railroads to make that kind of investment for two passenger trains a day , " Jacobs conceded . As a result , some Amtrak trains run at speeds slower than did trains on the same routes 30 years ago . The new westbound Lake Shore Limited takes six hours longer to make its run from the East Coast to Chicago than did the New York Central Railroad 's trains in 1953 , according to one report . AMTRAK 'S SLEEK new turboliners make the 85 ? mile dash between Chicago and Milwaukee in 92 minutes . The figure is impressive , but the Milwaukee Road and Chicago &; North Western Railway trains used to make the same run in 75 minutes in the early 1950s . Amtrak , however , has surpassed the railroads in one respect  --  red ink . Since its creation the agency has had deficits totaling $1.8 billion , about $1.5 billion of which has been made up by federal subsidies . Last year Amtrak lost $352,5 million carrying 17.4 million passengers . The profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $13 million , as did the Southwest Limited that runs between Chicago and Los Angeles . MOST PROMISING Is the high density Northeast corridor between New York and Washington . Passengers on the corridor Metroliners paid $41.5 million in fares last year , but the trains still lost more than $2 million . " Amtrak will never be a financial bonanza , " said Sen. Vance Hartke ID. , Ind . . " If you can make them self-sufficient you have accomplished a lot . " He estimates that Amtrak probably can expect substantial federal subsidies for another five to eight years . After that , Congress may tire of pumping money into it , just as it did the supersonic transport and space program in the 196es . One major reason Congress may not cut back sooner can be found in Montana  --  the horns state of Michael J. Mansfield , retiring Senate majority lead-or . ALTHOUGH ONLY one train leaves Chicago each day for San Francisco and another leaves for Los Angeles , two trains leave daily for Seattle . Both pass through Montana . The Empire Builder travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the North Coast Hiawatha runs through southern Montana , making a daily stop in Missoula , Mansfield 's home town . The Hiawatha is known as the " Mike Mansfield Special . " The two trains each year lost a combined $29 million , Amtrak ridership statistics show that the two trains are not heavily patronized by Montana residents . For the first four months of this year the 21 Amtrak stations in Montana accounted for 44,107 , passengers . ' The Champaign , Ill. station alone accollided for 34,299 Amtrak passengers over the same span , and Carbondale , Ill. , handled another 19,991 . The bulk of the ridership on the two Montana trains were traveling to , from , or between ' Chicago , Milwaukee , Minneapolis , or Seattle , ridership statistics show . " WE ARE a creature of Congress " said Edwin Edel , Amtrak vice president of public affairs . " Congress can vote new routes xi our appropriations . We manage the national rail system for Congress . " Jacobs does not believe Amtrak will ever be completely free of congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress for its budget , it is going to have political influences . We ca n't operate in a vacuum . There 's no way it can ' be different , " Even how Amtrak is preparing to begin a route across one of the , most smrsely populated parts of the country ? daily service between Portland , Ore. ; Boise , Idaho ; and Ogden , Utah . " It was our feeling that this was the last route mandated by Congress , " Jacobs said . THE DECISION to start the route was ' made ? despite the fact that Amtrak has no sleeping cars or diners available for the overnight run , and marketing studies have shown that a more profitable possibility would be a route south from Ogden to Las Vegas then west to Los Angeles . Amtrak wags already are referring to the . proposed train as the " Hatfield-Church Special " after Senators Mark 0 . Hatfield 11 . , Ore. and Frank Church D. , Idaho , whose home town is Boise . At the same time Amtrak officials hope to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago and Kansas City into a single ran . Hartke said recent legislation giving Amtrak , not Congress , the power to decide key routes should put an end to the worst abuses . " Of course , " he warns , " this does not mean that there wo n't be pressure . " ONE OF THE staunchest defenders of Amtrak 's long distance routes , like the " Mansfield Special " is Amtrak board member Joseph V. , a Continental Can Co. executive who has for years shunned flying in favor of trains on business trips . loves nothing better than to hold informal lounge car seminars on the subject of Amtrak . His students usually are surprised passengers who have finally found someone who knows the answers to their questions . . believes the greatest threat to passenger train service west of the Hudson River comes from the continual carping by Amtrak critics about the big deficits run by long-distance trains , mainly in the West , Since short-distance trains operating between big cities , like the New York-toWashington Metroliners , show the smallest deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones retained , some critics contend , TENTATIVE figures show those Northeast trains lost a combined $48 million out of Amtrak 's total operating losses of $503 million during the 1978 fiscal year The long-distance trains lost $300 million . " Those long-haul trains carry only 20 per cent of our passengers , " replied , " but account for 80 per cent of our revenues , The biggest part of our business is on the long hauls .. " There is a lot more to this country . than the Northeast . "
