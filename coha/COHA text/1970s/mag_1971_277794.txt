The buyer of a convertible car used to type himself as a free-spending sport . Today he types himself as a nostalgic eccentric . Once a symbol of status and romance , the convertible is well on its way to joining tail fins on the scrap heap . They account for only 1.5% of 1971-model sales , down from 1.6% in the 1970 model year and a peak 6.7% in 1963 . The trend is toward an even lower percentage ; American Motors stopped making cars with roll-down tops in 1968 , and Ford may do the same in the next model year , which begins this autumn . " We are almost certain that this is the last year we will be making convertibles , " says one Ford executive . <P> The popularity of air conditioning , which now goes into 60% of all new cars , is probably the prime reason for the convertible 's demise ; it offers coolness without the disadvantage of a noisy ride . Vinyl roofs , which now go on 43% of U.S.-made cars , provide the sporty look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to major changes in the U.S. physical and social atmosphere . Riding around with the top down is a dubious pleasure in the polluted urban air of the 1970s . And Ralph Nader 's safety crusade has prompted some would-be buyers to consider how they might fare in a rollover accident-even though there is no statistical evidence that convertibles are less safe . In an era of growing crime , the convertible is an easy target ; knife-wielding thieves can readily slash through the top to loot or steal a parked car . Besides all that , observes Chuck Norwood , a member of Lincoln-Mercury 's product-planning staff , " the convertible was part of a life-style that has changed . Men used to take their girls out on moonlit nights to country lanes " where they could lower the top and admire the stars . Today , notes Norwood , the man is more likely to take the girl back to his apartment for a more direct approach . <P> All is not lost for fresh-air fiends , however : automakers are increasingly replacing the convertible with the European-style sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Norwood , " but shuts out dirt , noise and potential thieves . " Until recently , demand had been too small for automakers to set up an assembly-line procedure for making sun roofs ; they still send many cars to the seven-year-old American Sunroof Co. of Southgate , Mich. , where craftsmen cut a hole in the roof and install a sliding steel panel . But the market is expanding so swiftly that in January American Motors began making sun roofs on its own assembly lines .
