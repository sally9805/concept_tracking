txt Representative Wilbur D. Mills , who has vowed to defeat the Administration 's general revenue-sharing program , unveiled an alternative plan of his own for financial aid to the cities at a secret meeting yesterday with key Democratic officeholders from around the nation . The plan was said to have been well received by all those present , including two Governors , three Mayors , two Senators and Lawrence F. O'Brien , the chairman of the Democratic National Committee . Mr. O'Brien had called the meeting as part of a series that he has been holding in an attempt to harmonize conflicting views within the Democratic party . Mr. Mills 's plan differs from the Administration 's revenuesharing proposal in a number of ways and would be called by some other name . Some Key Differences Among the key differences are these : ? The financial assistance would go to cities only , not states , counties and towns also , as in the Administration 's plan . qThe amount would be less ? $3.5-billion , compared with $5-billion in the first full year of the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part , at least , on the basis of need , Which is not a direct factor in the Administration 's bill . Need would he determined by some sort of formula involving the proportion of poor individuals . in the community . , liTht ' - program would be authorized for a limited time , perhaps three or five years , instead of being permanent , as in the Administration 's plan. , ( iThe money could be spent only for purposes that the legislation would specify , rather than for any purpose , as , in the Administration 's bill  --  the much advertised " no strings ' aspect of the Nixon plan . While Mr. Mills has not yet drafted every detail of his Proposal  --  his idea reportedly is to restrict fife permissible uses of the money to financing services that are normally performed by municipalities , such as fire and police protection , sanitation and health services . The use of the money for construction or other capital expenditures would be specifically prohibited , according to Mr. IvIills 's present thinking . Mr. Mills was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the moment , because he had not yet unveiled it to any members of the Ways and Means Committee . Accounts of the meeting also made it clear that Mr. Mills had not yet decided on every detail of his plan ? including , for example , what size city would be included . Also still open is the key question of how to make the aid-to-cities program a tax measure , over which the Ways and Means Committee would have jurisdiction , rather than a spending measure , which would go to the Appropriations Committee . One idea that Mr. Mills put forth , but indicated he was not wedded to , would be the crea-1 tion of a special trust fund into which the specified amount of tax receipts would be placed , for distribution under the new urban-aid program . Accounts of the meeting differed In one key regard  --  the extent to which Mr. Mills expressed confidence that he could get the bill through Congress . One person who attended said Mr. Mills promised he would have the bill through the House by July ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . Both Governors who were present , ? Marvin Mandel of Maryland and John J. Gilligan of Ohio  --  were I said to have expressed reasonable satisfaction with the Mills alternative , even . though states would receive no direct aid under the bill . Neither Governor could be reached for comment . But Mr. Mills was said to have pointed out to the Governors that cities ' demands on state treasuries would be lessened if his plan were'enacted . In addition , Mr. Mills was said to have pledged that forthcoming revisions in the Medicaid program would bring its costs under better control and to have pointed out that the welfare legislation now going through Congress would stop further increases in state costs for this program . Others who were present at the afternoon meeting in a private dining room on the House side of the Capitol included three Mayors  --  Thomas J. D'Alesandro 3d of Baltimore , Frank W. Burke of Louisville and Henry W. Maier of Milwaukee . The Senate majority leader , Mike Mansfield of Montana , was also present briefly , as was Senator Edmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of his own . The provisions of Mr. Muskie 's plan are somewhere between those of the Administration and those of Mr. Mills .
