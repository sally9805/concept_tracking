MUSCLE Builder Charles Atlas might describe the present U.S. business recovery as a 97-lb. weakling - too puny to rout the bullyboy of unemployment . Members of TIME 'S Board of Economists use more scholarly analogies , but they make the same point . At a recent all-day meeting , they offered this analysis of the nation 's economy : <P> &gt; The recovery from last year 's recession is the slowest and lowest of any since World War II . <P> &gt;Unemployment , which rose last month to 6.2% of the labor force , matching December 's nine-year high , will still hover around 6% by year 's end if nothing is done to put more muscle into the recovery . <P> &gt; Inflation is slowly subsiding , at least in terms of consumer prices , and a large growth in worker productivity will help to check it further this year . <P> &gt; The fast rise in productivity will also hold down new hiring . <P> &gt; Given these factors , the U.S. sorely needs a combination of tax cuts and accelerated Government spending to speed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be about $1,050 billion , far off the Administration 's forecast of $1,065 billion . <P> This analysis differs sharply from the reading of Administration economists and the monetarist school led by Milton Friedman , who see a vigorous expansion developing . Friedman recently went so far as to say that the problem is " to keep the economy from going too fast " and setting off another inflationary spiral . Yet most economists and businessmen tend to agree with TIME 'S board . <P> Martin Gainsbrugh , chief economist of the Conference Board , a nonprofit business research organization , has compiled figures to prove that so far the current upturn has been notably weak . Gainsbrugh calculates that the 1970 " recession " - which was officially given that name by the National Bureau of Economic Research two weeks ago-hit bottom in November . Thus , by the end of April , the present recovery was five months old . At that stage in the four previous postwar recoveries , industrial production showed increases ranging from 6.4% to 10.2% above recession lows , while real gross national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing employment rose 1.2% to 3.8% . In the current recovery , by contrast , industrial production has struggled up only 2.8% from its low point , real G.N.P . only 1.7% , and manufacturing employment a mere .6% . <P> Sleeping Giant . Assuming no change in Washington policy , members of the Board of Economists see small reason to expect a speedup soon . Despite much talk of expansionary federal budget policy , they find that Government tax and spending programs are not very stimulating . Arthur Okun pointed out that the major force in the recovery so far has been a jump in home building from an annual rate of 1.1 million starts in January 1970 to 1.9 million recently . <P> The housing upturn , however , may be leveling off . Construction is getting close to the annual rate of 2,000,000 starts that some housing experts believe to be the probable average for the 1970s . Besides , mortgage interest rates have begun to rise again , and are likely to go still higher because other interest rates are climbing .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
