Richard L. Barkley is as straight as they come . An Annapolis graduate who retired as a Navy commander after 15 years of service , Barkley , 56 , is president of a small manufacturing company , an active Republican , and has lived in Palo Alto , Calif. , for the past 30 years . Unlikely as it seems , Barkley last week was arrested for rioting at a Palo Alto rock festival . <P> It all began when he accepted a newspaper invitation placed by local merchants to attend the festival at Palo Alto 's Lytton Plaza . The week before , a similar event at the plaza had erupted into a store-window-smashing binge . The merchants now advertised for respectable citizens to come " observe what really happens " and to see just how insufferable the city 's plague of " street people " could be . <P> Barkley showed up late in the evening . " I walked through the plaza , " he recalled , " and talked to some of the kids . They were all wiggling with the music and hollering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asses . " Then he overheard an older man giving instructions to a young audience about how to disrupt the proceedings . Citizen Barkley promptly trotted over and told the police , who thanked him warmly . <P> Raised Truncheon . As he headed for his car to go home , Barkley noticed a crowd beginning to stampede , followed by a surging blue line of helmeted , jump-suited riot police . He tried to leave , but a young cop raised his truncheon to strike him . " Son , if you touch me with that , " Barkley warned him , " you 've touched the wrongest man in Palo Alto . " <P> The club was lowered , but Barkley was nonetheless barred from departing and pushed back into the crowd . He was about to find out more about " what really happens " than he expected . <P> Apparently without audible warning , the police blocked all four streets around the plaza and corralled Barkley and 362 others-including at least a dozen other over-30 straights who had also accepted the merchants ' invitation-into a compact mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , at 3:30 a.m. , the entire crowd was bused off to jail . <P> There followed a dozen hours of official indifference and indignity-including an apparent slowdown by deputies in booking the detainees , who were kept 80 to a cell . It was not until late in the afternoon that the wrongest man in Palo Alto was finally mugshot , fingerprinted and given a summons to appear in court this week on a charge of " rioting . " Barkley and a number of fellow straight defendants say they may sue for false arrest . Among them are Namon J. Nichols , a 31-year-old electrical engineer , and Stanford University Professor William R. Kincheloe , 44 . They joined Barkley in refusing to appear in heroes ' roles at a radicals ' press conference , despite being irked at their treatment by police . " I was 100% behind the police , " said Nichols . " Now I 'm about 80% and trying to analyze what happened to me . " <P> Like many Americans , Barkley is still emphatically on the side of law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of harassment that the police are obviously stupid in doing . It is n't enough to scare , just enough to make you mad and antagonistic that it happens to the kids . "
