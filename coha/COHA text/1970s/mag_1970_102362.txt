My case history is , I think , typical enough . I am now 45 years old . By the time I had reached 32 , however , I was well on my way to cardiovascular bankruptcy . The seat of my pants was the only working physical resource I had left . When it was n't parked in an office chair , it was ensconced in a car on its way to somebody 's living-room sofa for a parish call . I needed eight cylinders and a ton and a half of metal to fetch one pound of junk mail from a post office two blocks away . The idea of walking simply never occurred to me . I had put away childish things . // Unfortunately , the price of such maturity is high . Since I never , except for a brief college flirtation with four-wall handball , had the least interest in participant sports , I had reached the prime of life with about as much muscle tone as an overcooked lasagna . Item . One Holy Week  --  it was back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is now  --  I had to kneel 12 times in a row during the ceremony of the Washing of the Feet . By the time I got to foot No. 10 , I was dizzy , weak-kneed and ready to argue that having 12 apostles was an instance of divine cruelty . Item . Cutting across someone 's backyard I had to step up a stone ledge about 30 inches high . I made it only after two tries , and my legs trembled all the way to the house . Item . I would wait on one leg for the downstairs John to be empty rather than negotiate the staircase to the free one on the second floor . I had , in short , forgotten what it was like to have a body that was not a burden . Brother Ass , instead of carrying me , had to be lugged everywhere at the price of a pounding heart and perspiring brow . // Things are better since then . By and by I shall mention a few of the blind alleys I went up in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of satisfaction at the recovery of some measure of body sense . At what it 's like , for instance , to clear a puddle six feet wide , with room to spare . At being able to feel cool on a hot windless day by running downhill . At the pleasure of being out in a 10-knot breeze and being able to turn it off by running with it  --  and to double its force by running against it . At remembering how we really catch our breath by exhaling hard , not by trying to inhale , and at being able to do it after an uphill run without stopping the run at the top of the hill . ( It 's not all effortless , of course . As time goes on , one 's wind comes back considerably faster than one 's legs . But it 's nice to know that old flesh and bones , even if only in halfway decent shape , can be a stimulating pleasure instead of a pain. ) // By now , no doubt , you have concluded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , I suppose , I shall have to concede the point . But in all the major senses I deny it . I run every day , and yet I find jogging , as normally conceived , a detestable pastime . As much as I can I dissociate myself from it utterly . To begin with , by a stroke of good luck , I took up running about six months before the current jogging fad began to be publicized . I have an instant and adverse reaction to doing anything , however praiseworthy , once it has been proclaimed as being In . This kind of nick-of-time luck has been with me for years . I dug my wine cellar about a year before TIME magazine wrote its article on the 1953 vintage and kicked off the long chain of events that has since blessed us with better wines and cursed us with wine snobs and high prices . I also grew a beard just a few months before face hair began sprouting again everywhere . In my own mind , therefore , I am not now nor have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a jogger . I simply drink wine , grow hair and run now and then . // In the second place , I find jogging a delusion and a bore . It is a delusion because most men take it up in the hope it will work off an encroaching potbelly . Unfortunately , however , even if spot reducing were possible , which it is n't , the number of calories consumed by one hour 's running is only 900 . Five minutes ' worth of banana split checks in at 1,100 . Case closed . It 's intake that has to be curbed if you want to lose weight . Exercise will make you feel better , but it ca n't get ahead of the fat man 's diet we all live on . // That jogging is a bore is just as easily proved . As commonly practiced , jogging is done in order to achieve something other than itself  --  like weight loss or muscle tone . Considered in itself , it is about as interesting as navel-watching . It will keep you amused for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull chore . Even taking out the garbage has greater entertainment value . Human activities capable of exciting the mind , refreshing the soul and clearing away the slums of boredom in which we live have to be worth something in themselves . Golf is . Softball is . Skiing is . So are swimming , handball , cooking , wine bibbing and sex . But plodding 10 laps around a cinder track in a silly suit is not . ( And anyone who does the equivalent 20 laps around an indoor track is simply asking to have himself certified and committed. ) // By my principles exercise makes sense only if it is the byproduct of some more weighty and more human activity . As a matter of fact , it wo n't be kept up long enough to be of any use unless it is . I went through a fair number of idiot exercise gambits before I came up with my present satisfactory routine . I did sit-ups , running in place and a couple of other approximations to solitary confinement , and then I settled on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splitting and walking-running . They illustrate my principle beautifully . Wood splitting first . // It provides me , obviously , with wood for my fireplace , but that is only the smallest corner of my satisfaction with it . It takes time to develop the coordination to use a 10-pound sledge , three steel wedges and a splitting ax efficiently . Especially the splitting ax . You go through a fair number of handles before you are able to connect smartly all the time , but even at that it 's one of the cheapest forms of recreation and health insurance around  --  assuming , of course , you can get the logs to split . For less than a $20 initial outlay and $10 a year upkeep it will restore your heart , shoulders , arms , back and gut to decent muscular shape  --  all at the bargain-time rate of about 15 minutes a day . // As I said , though , there are other satisfactions . One of the great delights of life is to take a slice of a really big tree ( say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work it down into a pile of cordwood . If it is oak or maple or one of the soft , straight-grained woods it splits like a dream . The halving of the piece has to be done with sledge and wedges , but after that the splitting ax does the whole job . Every shot produces a clean separation ; first along the radii of the log , giving you long thin wedges , then across the wedges , down the grain made by the growth rings , giving you handsome , almost square fireplace pieces . The body gets its exercise , but the chief recipient of pleasure is the mind . The whole world has texture , shape and grain , and man was made to run the thumb of his intellect across it . Whether in beholding the fit of twin almonds in the shell or the startling whiteness of freshly split maple , he stands before creation in the image of God and catches a glimpse of what only God saw till then : the hidden , the unobserved , the mysterious deep-down things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water on a parched tongue . Especially when you live , as we do , in a hell of fakery and superficiality. // On the other hand , if the logs you split are elm the whole vision changes . Put away the splitting ax ; elm just laughs at it . It splits all right , but it does n't come apart . One wedge is driven in all the way . The crack starts . A second is driven in next to it . The crack widens , but still no separation . You turn the log on its side and drive the third , praying it will force the opening enough to loosen one of the first two so you can keep going . An expert can get by with three wedges , but a duffer can easily lose all three in a log that still has n't split in two . And even when an expert 's split is complete he may need a hand ax to chop through the crossed sinews of elm that refuse to break their grip . // Elm is good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much slower-growing pile of cordwood  --  but , peculiarly , it , too , refreshes the mind . What you have here is not the sweet mystery of creation yielding easily to man as its lord but the sheer cussedness of things fighting you all the way . You have a glimpse of Earth not as man 's mother and friend , but as a great lummox of a drinking partner always brawling and taunting , full of his own stubborn stupidities and ready any hour of the day or night for still another pointless round of Indian wrestling . In the age of the automatic elevator , the TV dinner and the right pill for any malaise  --  in this , our era of blissful trust that all will go well just because we told it to  --  how salutary to be reminded of the general boobishness of creation . How marvelous , for the expenditure of only 15 minutes , to recover the truth that things that come easy are , as often as not , fakes . How nice to be headed once again in the only human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walking-running . I live in a town of fairly steep hills  --  to do nothing but run would be to invite exhaustion . When my fellow townspeople catch me walking up a steep hill ( my exercising is done on local streets and roads and my habits are known ) , they taunt me . " What 's the matter ? " they shout . " Given up running ? " I thank them for their concern but inform them that while I am eccentric , I am not crazy . I have no intention of doing anything just to prove a point . Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds . // There 's the point , you see . The refreshment and enlargement of the mind counts most ; the body goes along for the exercise , but it sits in the back seat . That 's why I call my daily recreation walking-running and not jogging . It is a time for the estimation of Earth again , for the breathing in of the four seasons . It is a time for liberation from the prisons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another dungeon . The jogger has to do his mile or two without stopping . He keeps his eye on his watch . He bores you with the senseless information that this week he is down to an eight-minute mile while last week he could barely manage a nine . // The walker , on the other hand , is a free man . If while running he sees something he can appreciate only at walking speed , he walks . If while walking he finds something that can be savored only in place , he stops . If his copy of the Times , picked up midway in his progress , has a particularly good story , he finds himself a convenient rock , step or bench and sits down . He has , for the hour or so a day in which he is on the town  --  footloose is the exact word for it  --  broken out of the mold . He does n't have to do anything but be alive and aware . // And when he talks to you he is no bore . He gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality itself  --  of the height of the snowdrifts , the depth of the thaw , the progress of spring and the warmth of the rain . He is a man who has read not his own opinions of himself , but the face of nature . He tells you of striped sunlight in the woods you should n't miss , of a stand of milkweed you must at all costs smell and of a German shepherd three blocks away that is to be avoided like the plague . He is , in short , often delightful , frequently useful and even at his worst , tolerable . Who could ask for more ? // But it is not only in his services to his friends that the walker excels . If he is worth his salt he walks and runs in all weathers . The jogger is a man of limited vision . He begins by buying a sweat suit , and his career is nipped in the bud . He is good only for weather that is moderate and dry . If the temperature drops below zero he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or stay home . If it rains , he is licked utterly . The walker , on the other hand , does not own a sweat suit . As a man of sensitivity , the very inelegance of the name is enough to gall him . And as a man of maturity and substance he is glad to have parted company for good with every vestige of the smelly locker rooms of his youth . He walks or runs in whatever clothes he finds convenient , the variations of his dress adding spice to the world of his walking . He owns sneakers , of course , and wears them whenever possible because sneakers are one of the few trappings of youthful sportiveness delightful enough to escape from the curse of compulsory phys ed . But for cold and rain , he has clothes that make him a match for any weather . Sweaters , a stout , hooded coat , cotton work gloves and arctics for the depth of winter ( all of which he can use at other times ) and a head-to-toe rain suit to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jogger would not even consider going out in such airs because he can not conceive of running with all that gear . But the walker , free man that he is , goes out and is thrice blessed . First , because he in fact gets more exercise for his time spent . ( Run in arctics all the way through January and February  --  it gets you in the legs at first , but it does wonders . ) Second , when he takes the arctics off and runs in sneakers again , he has a double pleasure : the ease of running with a lighter load and the little-boy delight of the feel of sneakers after a long winter of shoes . There is no true man on earth who can resist the temptation to jump under such circumstances . // The third blessing , however , is the greatest . The man who walks in the rain has the rarest liberty in the world . Only children share his freedom . Some adults are still capable of relishing the snow , though most only grumble and bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of us who ever love the rain again as we did when we were children . The walker in the rain suit is one of the elect . He can take all that Heaven can give plus some side shots from buses speeding through puddles and still be reasonably dry . Better yet , he can stamp through floods , walk uphill in a gutter that has become a torrent and , if he likes , build dams of snow or leaves and send the water all over the street . He can sail sticks , try to keep pace with bits of melting ice as they tumble downhill and make bets with himself as to whether they will last all the way to the bottom . In our sophistication we think we are too grown-up for such things . As someone once said , " Adults are all right ; it 's grown-ups I ca n't stand . " The man of full age never outgrows anything genuinely fascinating , not even snowballs or bubble gum . As an adult , he simply lifts them into higher and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relishes them even more . We outgrow our shoes but not our loves . It is forgetfulness , not age , that robs us of our joys . // But that is enough argument . From there on , the walker proceeds through cloudbursts of delight , even in the blazing sun . He throws stones , skims rocks , gathers pine-cones , nuts , cylinder-head bolts and sparkplugs . He picks mushrooms , eats privet leaves , chews upon the sweet shoots of long grass and , from May through October , comes home with wildflowers in his shirt pocket . // He walks with his dog , and they both jump a puddle together : he catches a glimpse of how the dog knows things , for he himself did n't intellectualize his adjustment of pace so he could make his spring from the edge of the puddle ; he did it by body sense  --  with the light of reason turned off and only the brilliance of the sensitive intellect working . He climbs a hill and comes out of the shade into blinding sunlight on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees all things as solid and transparent at once  --  how the world really is something brought tremblingly but triumphantly out of nothing . He watches squirrels race , dogs fight , birds mate and boys roughhouse , and he sees the whole sporting world as an image of the processions of the Trinity , of the divine roughhouse by which Father , Son and Holy Ghost exchange omnipotent muscle and , in the midst of their eternal handsprings , back-flips and diving somersaults , toss off a creation that is one long shout of muscular delight . // Man loses the loveliness , of course . More often than not he uses his strength for cruelty , depredation and war . But for all that , sport still stands as witness that power was never meant to be more than a game . It is seriousness that has estranged us  --  we are always closer to home when we play .
