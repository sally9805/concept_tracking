In an earlier and simpler age , there was only baseball . A really tight pennant race would drown out political campaigns in September , and kids were let out of school at World Series time . But , as everybody knows , faster and more violent sports have eclipsed the old national pastime . <P> Or have they ? With last week 's pennant playoffs , baseball suddenly recaptured so much suspense and emotion that Ring Lardner could not have written a better script . Winners of the National League 's Western Division were the well-muscled Cincinnati Redlegs , with the best record ( 99 wins , 63 losses ) and some of the mightiest hitters in the league . Up against the Big Red Machine stumbled the New York Mets , living proof that baseball is still a game of inches . Two months ago , Manager Yogi Berra was within inches of losing his job again ( the New York Yankees dumped him in 1964 ) as the Mets floundered in the Eastern Division cellar , dispirited and haunted by injuries . After a spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches on the last day of the season . That was Miracle I , which rational men could dismiss as an unrepeatable quirk . <P> Like Lourdes . When the dust settled at Shea Stadium last week-literally settled , for maniacal fans made a fair attempt to atomize the ballpark - the Mets had stolen the series three games to two . Miracle II was worthy of a week at Lourdes . The Mets pitching , led by sore-shouldered Tom Seaver , held the Midwestern maulers to only eight runs in the five games . The asthenic Met batters , none of whom finished the regular season above .300 , banged out a hearty 23 runs . Met Shortstop Bud Harrelson ( 155 Ibs. ) miraculously escaped maiming when his scuffle with Cincinnati 's Pete Rose ( 189 Ibs. ) blossomed into the best-watched brouhaha since the 1968 Democratic National Convention . Rose later escaped injury at the hands of garbage-throwing Mets fans . <P> The Mets even made the lame and the halt rise from their pallets to perform . Willie Mays , 42 , sidelined with cracked ribs and due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent in as a pinch hitter during the final game and scratch singled in a run . Willie was replacing Veteran Ed Kranepool , the last of the original Mets , who in turn was substituting for Rusty Staub . Staub , on a home-run jag , could not play in the fifth game because he slammed into an outfield wall making a crucial catch in game four . Kranepool performed on cue by getting a single that brought in two runs . Homemade banners in the stands said it all : YOU GOT TA BEE-LEEVE . <P> While New York was outlasting Cincinnati , the 1972 World Champion Oakland Athletics were having their own tense five-game contest with the Baltimore Orioles in the American League playoffs . When the Orioles knocked out Oakland Ace Vida Blue ( 20-9 ) early in the first game and won it 6-0 , there was hope in Baltimore that the home team 's strong pitching staff , starring Jim Palmer ( 22-9 ) , would prevail over Oakland 's aces . But then came Oakland 's other stone walls , Ken Holtzman and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rollie Fingers stood their ground in three of the final four games as obdurately as a goal-line defensive unit in that other sport .
