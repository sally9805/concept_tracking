txt From all indications , the latest round of secret talks between presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger and Politburo member Le Duc Tho got off to a frosty start but appeared to warm up a little after the second meeting . Hanoi 's tone has been chilly since the intensive American bombing of the North Vietnamese heartland and the continued bombing south of the 20th parallel . Washington 's reminders about possible new military moves , depending on how the talks go , have not helped the atmosphere . Nor has President Nixon 's new authorization of U.S. air attacks on MIG aircraft and surface-to-air missile sites located north of the 20th parallel ( when they threaten B-52 's operating south of the parallel ) . No opened doors As if taking ' to heart Dr. Kissinger 's warning that he would not be " charmed " into an unsatisfactory agreement , no North Vietnamese greeted the American negotiator and his deputy , William H. Sullivan , when they arrived on the doorstep of the Communist-owned country mansion for Monday 's 4%-hour session with Mr. Tho and Xuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to enter . On Tuesday the Americans meted out the same treatment to the Hanoi delegates when they came to the American-chosen mansion at St.-Nom-la-Breteche . Mr. Tho and his advisers emerged smiling at the end of the six-hour meeting , in sharp contrast with their grim arrival , but they were not seen off by Dr. Kissinger . President Pompidou of France expressed the fervent hope during the second day of meetings that the Kissinger-Tho talks would succeed this time and that there would be " no eternal alternation between talks and bombing . " In as delicate and non-inflamatory a manner as possible , the French President seemed to be reproaching both the United States and North Vietnam , but principally the United States , when he cited writer Benjamin Constant 's words , " The proof that th-e-Y  --  wanfe-d ? war was that they defended themselves . " He was addressing a semi-annual press conference at the Elysees Palace . According to French sources , representations from Paris and Moscow played an important role in President Nixon 's decision to suspend the bombing . These sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were an American demand for the counting of Hanoi troops to be withdrawn from the South and for guarantees of non-violation of the peace agreement . // *Frost in Paris // Hanoi is said to fear that once such guarantees were given , Saigon would allege violation of the peace agreement as an excuse to demand new American military interventions . The French Communist newspaper L'Humanite suggested Monday that the chief obstacle to an agreement remains the dispute over whether Vietnam is one nation or two states . One , two , or three ? Hanoi insists that Vietnam is one nation . Saigon , supported to a degree by the United States , affirms that North and South Vietnam are separate states . L'Humanite indicates that Hanoi is ready to concede the de facto existence of three administrations in Viet . nam - that of Hanoi in the North , and those of Saigon and of the Viet Cong in the South . But this formula does not satisfy Saigon , which claims full sovereignty over all of South Vietnam , and wants Hanoi in some way to acknowledge this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is the sole legitimate government in all of Vietnam , but that it does not intend to reunify Vietnam by fqrce and that it concedes the right of **32;1027;TOOLONG of-South - Viet-  - nam . The Oct. 20 agreement between Dr. Kissinger and Mr. Tho broke down ultimately because Saigon refused to accept the way in which these questions were left deliberately vague , and because President Nixon supported this refusal . For new formulations to succeed , it seems clear that new decisions are required . So far , neither Washington nor Hanoi seems dis-. posed to yield .
