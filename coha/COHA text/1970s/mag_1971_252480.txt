Columnist Joseph Kraft called it the President 's same old " ego trip-taken now by proxy . " The New York Times 's James Reston simply called the suggestion " unspeakable . " <P> What had stirred the anger of these and other war critics was a column by Joseph Alsop praising Richard Nixon 's " cool courage " in making the " lonely decision " to invade Laos . Alsop , a consistent advocate of strong U.S. military action in Indochina , declared : " Senator Fulbright and many of his colleagues , in turn , are downright eager to be proved right by an American defeat in war , and will loathe being proved wrong by U.S. success in Southeast Asia . " <P> Leaving aside the specific attack on Fulbright , there is obviously much truth in Alsop 's idea .

In a way , that is one of the highest costs of Viet Nam-the violence it has done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting finally stops , the U.S. will still be bedeviled by such recriminations about who was right or wrong , loyal or disloyal . Learning to live with the memory of Viet Nam may in some ways turn out to be as painful as living with the present fact .
