Atlanta 's Samuel W. Williams is a minister in the Progressive National Baptist Convention , which split from Joseph Jackson 's group . He regards Jackson as a man with " no constituency . The silent majority is very silent . " His own position , Williams feels , is within the black mainstream , trying to achieve social change while still trying to cooperate with the white community . Williams , in his 50s , is acting academic dean of Morehouse College in Atlanta , sole pastor of the 650-member Friendship Baptist Church , and chairman of Atlanta 's Human Relations Commission . <P> Williams , like his former pupil , Martin Luther King , espouses a basic integrationist philosophy . " The Judaeo-Christian teaching , " he says flatly , " is simple on the unity of mankind . Those in the black movement who are moving toward separation are wrong . We have been criticizing the white Protestants for separatism . If they were wrong , I do n't see how the black militants can be right . What sense does it make in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in a corner all by himself ? " <P> Even so , Williams expects little from whites . Says he grimly : " White America would rather see this nation destroyed than give up white racism . The worst institution in America today is the white church . It has more hypocrisy per square inch than any other . And no impression I have received in the past five years has made any difference . " <P> Ghetto Christ . Like Marshall , Williams sees the black church as a redeeming agent in a racist society . " The black man has understood , in a manner and depth that the white man has not , that worship is a lie if justice is not done : This explains why he has pressed for justice so much . Religion is justice . The black man sees Jesus as identified with the poor and the suffering . After all , he was something of a ghetto leader . " <P> Accordingly , Williams feels that black demands for reparations are sound " in principle . " Tactically , even James Forman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concedes . " My uncle was a farmer and he had mules to work with . One day I saw him take a sapling and knock a mule to the ground . When I protested , he said , ' Son , I had to get his attention . ' " Even violent resistance , says Williams , may be necessary some day . " I do not counsel violence , " he insists . " It is a dangerous weapon . But it is conceivable that there are circumstances where it may be necessary . " <P> To most black churchmen , as to Samuel Williams , the future is an open and agonizing question . Some , like Joseph Jackson , find their answers by retreating to solutions of the past . Others try different paths . Pastor Albert B. Cleage Jr . of Detroit 's Shrine of the Black Madonna , who preaches that Jesus was literally black , has announced that he is founding a " Black Christian Nationalist Movement " that will have its first " national convention " in Detroit this week . Cleage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Churches last December , also expects to attract black Jews , * sunni Muslims and even atheists to his " black liberation " movement .
