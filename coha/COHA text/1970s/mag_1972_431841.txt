 | TWO OF THE MISSING A romance of the last war for all you guys out there groovin ' on IF IT HAD NOT HAPPENED to Flynn and Stone ? if those two had not " gotten theirs , " as that crew of witnesses was so fond of saying when some " unlucky " member did not survive ? I might have been able to leave the war behind with that last flight to Copenhagen . I had been a reporter in Saigon during most of 1968 , and when I returned to the city for a few days in the spring of 1969 , I knew I had exhausted the " war experience . " I felt the ugliness of the place for the first time and realized that , yes , I had been part of it . I saw that the everyday risks were hardly worth the garbled paragraphs that had appeared under my name in the wire stories of United Press International . When I boarded that Air France flight I knew I would not become one of those who kept coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the cheap thrill of war , as surely as to heroin . In Copenhagen I would go to the ballet and drink carafes of white wine and eat whole buckets of steamed mussels , and change the subject from the war . If it had not happened to Flynn and Stone , I , too , might now read the cling-clang datelines of the battle reports from that continuing war with the disinterest of most Americans . In a war almost devoid of glamour ( dear God , have we come to the point where a face like Martha Raye 's is the best that can be found to inspire our troops to battle ? ) Flynn and Stone supplied a sort of mock romance in the only war we had . " There may be other , more famous photographers with greater technical skill in Vietnam , " wrote David Greenway of Time , " but there are none with more courage and initiative than Stone and Flynn . " All of us saw in Flynn 's extraordinary looks and manners the most dashing mirrored image of ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon good looks gave a validity to the ex-84 perience , and this was why he was courted : 1 correspondents and colonels alike . He looked just like all the war heroes in the movies . a ! having him along somehow made Vietnam To , i the way a war was supposed to look . Like actor father , Sean Flynn filled the image of ti , e romantic swashbuckler ; a man of trim athletic build , he stood 6 feet 3 inches , his brown hair turned gold in the sun . But along with the good looks there was the strange , disquieting presence .. People would turn toward him and stop talking when he entered a room , and when he spoke ( often a mere mumble ) , people stopped to listen . He would stand there perfectly calm and at ease . but there was something too controlled about hirn-i that made you watch to see if he might just lung. - away in an unexpected direction . Dana Stone , the son of a small-town Vermont postman , was a full seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy-colored hair , and wore wire-rim glasses . He was a person you might literally overlook in a crowd except that he was in constant motion . In Vietnam he had a reputation for courage and daring , and the Marines called him " mini-Grunt " because he was rugged and tough and had taken more risks to get his pictures than almost any other photographer in the war . His pictures won prizes from The Hague and from Tass , the Soviet news agency even when he was working as a free lance wit inexpensive equipment . One of his best photo-. used as a Time magazine cover , shows a Marine crouched in fear during the siege at Con Thien . Both he and Flynn had done camera work for the CBS documentary " Charlie Company , " which won the Peabody Award . In another time , in another war , these two might have been national characters of heroic standing , and their capture ( in Cambodia on April 6 , 1970 ) might have been cause for grandiloquent public testimonials . They were the sort i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years ago would have sent gunboats nd legions of troops to rescue , just to bring back heir adventure stories . As it was , they were heroes not to the people : t home but to the soldiers who fought the war ? : iecause they were into the drug and music revolution that the soldiers had come out of in the States , because they always carried a quantity of pot and tapes of the latest sounds from New York when they traveled among the troops . The reality of war as senseless slaughter had transformed the old Hemingway romance by the time we arrived at Saigon , and Joseph Alsop and ethers like him were regarded as absurd old men till trying to recount the valiant victories of World War II . " Who the fuck 's he think he is ? " : he Marines asked when I followed Alsop into Khe Sanh , weeks after the siege had lifted . And he would quote the Khe Sanh commander as repeating Douglas MacArthur 's " words for the honored dead : They died unquestioning and uncomplaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hope that we would go on to victory . ' " The words were simply not appropriate in this war . There was no victory at Khe Sanh or anywhere in Vietnam , and my most striking memory of the place is of embittered Marines sitting there cursing while listening to a newscast reporting that President Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff had pledged not to abandon Khe Sanh . A young Marine in the corner of a bunker that had taken several dead and wounded kept playing his guitar and singing , " Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? " Flynn and Stone sat there , passing a joint and groovin ' on the GIs ' music and sharing their own tapes , Arlo Guthrie singing about evading the draft . The GIs saw their own sense of absurdity given full expression by Flynn and Stone . I have a tape recording of a gathering at Stone 's house in Danang where he and Flynn swap stories about their war experiences . The striking thing about the stories , when I listen to the tape now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurdity of the situation that our brother journalists were ( are ) attempting to record as another solemn chapter in the continuing history of warfare , meanwhile celebrating the old macho exhilaration of being shot at and missed . Flynn and Stone enjoyed the war . So did every other correspondent in Vietnam . We enjoyed the bitter humor and the proximity to all the gadgetry of war ; even those of us who never shared the all-American fascination with weapons of death got a certain charge from being with those who did . We were heirs to the tradition of war , and war still meant finding the personal courage to edge right up to death while staying calm . It was no more or less complicated than a response to the ultimate challenge as outdated and senseless as a barroom showdown . And so we had this war , and my friends and I had to be there . Because it was there ; because , as Flynn explained to a friend who did n't want to go , " it is the most important thing happening in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , Flynn and Stone were there " posing as journalists " because they 're thrill-seekers looking for a new adventure . " How does it feel , " a woman reporter asked Stone 's wife , " to be married to a death wish ? " These were the " responsible " ones , those who never examined their own motives and who , if they had , would have discovered they had actually fled a wife and family back in suburban U.S.A. and gone to war and felt young again and enjoyed it . There was never any pretense with Flynn and Stone . They had paid their own fares to the war ; neither had used a camera professionally before the war , nor did they have any plans to work as photographers after the war . When UPI gave Stone a new Nikon  | camera just after his arrival , he had to ask another photographer to show him how to change the film . The contradictions simply fed our cynicism , which in turn provided our invulnerability and made the enjoyment possible . One morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire fight as if we were privileged spectators in the Roman Colosseum ; the same afternoon we could be sailing off the beautiful beaches near Danang . One must go on living , after all . I mean , did you expect us to give up cigars ? As a nation , we had become so rich and powerful we could well afford these luxuries even in a war . Newsmagazine journalists got a week 's paid vacation for every ten weeks in the war and television journalists for every six weeks . An Army psychiatrist explained to me that the military 's promise of a maximum thirteen-month tour in the war , broken up by one and sometimes two paid vacations to any spot in the Orient friendly to the U.S. , was the reason there were so few mental breakdowns in this war , though " battle fatigue " had been a major problem in previous wars . He also told me that in previous wars large numbers of American GIs could not bring themselves to fire their weapons the first time in combat , while the opposite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that we were not unlike the Berlin cabaret set that kept on laughing , even mocking the storm troopers taking over the streets outside , until the setting had overwhelmed them , and they knew they had been part of it all along . The dream DID MANAGE TO LEAVE THE WAR , and for the I most part I had forgotten the textures of it until , eighteen months after they had been captured on a sunny Cambodian afternoon , I saw Flynn cleariy in a dream . Even at a distance , there was no mistaking him , though he stood in a slouch , his arms pulled down as if by shackles that embarrassed him . He wore the same faded vestments the prayerpeople of the Island of the Phoenix made for us that time because the holy man of peace , the " coconut monk " as he was known at the American Embassy , had a dream that one of us would surely die if we did n't have new-made clothes by daybreak . He was standing on a walkway atop some ancient stone stoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know someday I will see the setting for the first time and recognize its significance in the dream . He could see me running toward him , up the wide worn steps and onto the walkway , but ? typical of Flynn ? he did not yell or shout a greeting . It was his ideal of man 's behavior , a daily kind of courage , " cool and detached , free 86 from all physical excitement and impassive the calm of a god , " as a college friend once scribed him , quoting from Hadrian 's Memo : ( There is more to that quotation : " I do not t ter myself that I have ever attained " this k : of courage . " The semblance of such courage which I later employed was , in my worst dal only a cynical recklessness toward life ; in : best days it was only a sense of duty to which clung . ' ) " Hey , howya doin ' , boy , " he said , lightly mocking my own accent , with the widest possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex a handshake . It had been in Vientiane in April of 1969. last time I saw Flynn . He got an Embassy b gram from Saigon saying that Tim Page I. been wounded again and this time was " perha to die . " Both of us had been close to Page . s young English photographer who had lived fc - while in our apartment in Saigon and x , could n't resist taking too many chances . Flynn had looked up at me and said . " W you just have to make new friends . " The 1 stunned me at the time , but now I think it mu have been a thought his memory fetched up fr some old movie : it was what Flynn would be e petted to say . After reading the telegram .

" Pent-etre mourir . " Repeating the phrase t. ? yet another bargirl , Flynn started to cry . any then he ran off into the dark in shame until I caught up with him and said , " Listen , man . it 's all right to cry . " But . Flynn said , a man should n't We lay on the front porch of a house where we thought an American girlfriend of Flynn 's used to live and talked until dawn about our fathers Flynn told me then he was trying for the first time to write a journal . beginning with the time . at age five , that he fired a pistol through a desk at his father . He was deeply troubled by his obsession with war and , more than any man I ever knew there , he was struggling to understand his own place in it . Yet he could never leave it : there was always something he had n't seen or done or did n't yet understand . The day after he got the telegram , Flynn and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there calm and comforting while Page described every detail of his latest wound ? even with the incredible shock of having a chunk of rusty metal from a booby trap pass through his forehead and out the back of his skull , he had never lost consciousness . He had had another photographer take a picture of his face , which was hideously bruised as if he had been bludgeoned with clubs . I admired Flynn , a man of such ex- traordinary calm , because I had to rush outside to be sick from the sterile scene of row on row of men even younger than Page , their heads shaved and sagging where the best neurosurgeons money could buy had sawed out pie-shaped chunks of skull to clean out the rusty metal and sew the brains back in . I had seen hundreds of these same young men bloodied and maimed on the battlefield . That was all somehow natural , everything in its place and proper colors , red and ugly . But in that hospital ward , I had the same shock I remembered as a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our calf being lined up and killed behind others , further down the line , already skinned and cleaned . That night , after visiting Page , the old friends assembled in the huge apartment we had shared . The flat had brick-tile floors , slow-turning fans hung from the high ceilings , and a huge window overlooking a busy intersection on the main street . We had barstools arranged behind an old buffet we pushed up against the window , and we kept three sets of binoculars on top for watching the hookers and pushers and GIs and three stoned cyclo-drivers who parked on the opposite corners . The apartment fit all our romantic images of the city . It had been converted from a bordello. and the top two floors of the building were still lined up with girl : who would lean out the windows and squeal every night when we came home after curfew and had to throw cans to wake up the old man with the key to the downstairs gate . That night we all got stoned , and a crazy Danish cameraman had us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit- including perfect imitations of every moan and groan and twitch of Page and others around him . Though he tried not to let on , Flynn was more shaken by Page 's latest approach to death than by any of his own wounds ( he had been nicked by shrapnel three different times , as had Stone 1 . Later Flynn would tell another friend about crying that night in Vientiane : and after he had packed up Page 's belongings he wrote out his own will , quoted here in full . except for his and his mother 's addresses : " unWILLingly/if me so had . medivac-acked immediately ( or within a 1000 cybernetic years ) send goods to me . . . if cool-Aid , celestially unredeemable c/o Mrs. Liliane Loomis . . .

Flynn 's mother did not want his belongings after he was captured . It would have been admitting that he might not come hack .

POW ! No reason . Just shot him . Really strange . ause they 'd been in pretty good spirits before all this , but afterward I think everybody felt all guilty about it . " Stone would always say his first war-supported job was in the San Francisco Post Office , where special military section had been created to handle mail going to Vietnam .

The ship went to Europe instead , and Smiser lived in England find Spain for two years before she and Stone - finally patched up their differences through letters and he sent her the big gold nugget old Jay Webb had given them in Sawyer 's Bar . Stone and a number of other young photographers he later worked with had read an article in a photography magazine quoting the UPI photo chief as saying , " If you 're young and hungry and want to get rich and famous then Vietnam is the place to be . " UPI wrote back for all inquirers to stop by the bureau " when you get to Saigon .

Though his first war story was headlined , " Son of Robin Hood in Vietnam , " Flynn surpassed his father merely by being present for a war . The elder Flynn was grazed by a bullet in May of 1937 on a streetcar ride to the trenches outside Madrid , and he did visit Fidel Castro in the mountains shortly before he died in 1959 . But he had failed to pass his physicals for service in World War II , a failure that galled him . His friend David Niven once said : " He 'd done a lot  | of films about war and these were sometimes laughed at , especially in England . He was parodied as a man who should have been in it , and he was most unfairly pilloried because of it . This ate into him . This , compounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war itself ? for heroics at the time . " Sean 's mother , the French actress Lili Damita , had divorced the elder Flynn a year after Sean Leslie was born ( " out of this impossible snarl of two volatile people came something good anyway , " wrote Errol ) . It was the year of his sensational trial ? and acquittal ? on statutory rape charges , which produced the lines that made his name a joke for the rest of his life ? in like flynn , making love with your socks on , going below to see the moon through a porthole . Lili ? she prefers her first name and pronounces it from deep in the throat like Dietrich 's Lola ? took Sean to Palm Beach when he was a baby , so he could grow up " with the very best of families " and become an engineer as her father and grandfather in France had been . Sean " even looked like I wanted him to look , " she says , " and I did everything for him ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could be all I ever dreamed of . " She waited until Flynn was twenty-one before she got remarried , to Allen Loomis , a Fort Dodge , Iowa , manufacturer of ice cream specialties like Eskimo Pies . But she has kept the first floor of her modern Thai house in Palm Beach for Sean . Though he has n't been there since the spring of 1967 , his bedroom is still his , " though my husband sleeps there sometimes when Sean is n't here , " and his high-school girlfriend 's picture is beside the bed , though she is now married to a dentist and the mother of four children . Lili 's all-white upstairs apartment is decorated with forty or fifty photographs of her son . Not one of them shows him in Vietnam . While growing up , Sean came to admire the owner of a Palm Beach gunshop , who acquired a fantastic collection of weapons for him , including a 357 Magnum , a carbine with an Ml kit on it , a 44 Winchester channeled to hold three cartridges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take his weapons out to some country property his mother owned and play war games , mowing down enemy pine cones and beer cans and , sometimes , whole palm trees . Flynn 's mother was grateful for the gun dealer 's shooting lessons , because " it was something I could n't do . " She did see that Sean had the best education money could buy ? Palm Beach Private School and Lawrenceville prep school , where he was All-American in freestyle swimming , and then Duke University , where he was elected freshman class president on the slogan " In with Flynn . " He was only a few months into college when he accepted an offer to star in a sequel to Captain Blood written and produced by the same men who had done the original that had launched his father 's career back in 1938 ' Though the gossip-column reports made seem Sean was having the time of his life Hollywood ? sporting about in a new red Jaguar , . wearing the plumed hat of d'Artagnan ; firing flare gun , with Tuesday Weld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he la. described them as the " most miserable month . of his life . His father 's shadow was too o1 , powering there , and when he left for Spain to film his first movie , he never returned except for brief visit in 1967 . He moved into an apartment - his grandmother had left him in Paris , installsmoked mirrors on the ceiling of his bedroom plugged in two electric guitars he never learn to play , and mounted a loaded M16 ( " off safety on rock and roll , one up the spout . " as Pa would say ) over his bed . " I like to drive fast foreign cars , " Flynn sal in an early interview . " I like to fish , hunt , an sail . And I like to live it up with girls . I 'm what you might call a hedonist , a young man sped t , izing in pleasure . " By 1966 , he had done all this , even living on his father 's yacht part of the time , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris-Match he had " quit my life as a playboy " to take part in the " grandest a ' venture ? that of war and of death . " He arrive in Saigon in January of 1966 and promptly pre sented himself at the Time bureau to ask for free lance work . He was wearing full combat gear including two grenades ? their safety pins untaped ? hooked onto his web gear . In his first story , Flynn said he had felt like z tourist holding his cameras while men were dying all around him . He had just begun to learn about war and death , he said , " so I have decided stay two months more . " Flynn and Stone would always argue about which of them was the greater authority on war ? Stone had arrived a few months after Flynn . but then Flynn had not stayed there as mans months as Stone had . They met shortly after Stone arrived and started getting free-lance asignments from UPI as part of that energetic and talented collection of young men who lived out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the UPI offices . UPI relied very heavily on the -- young men who were willing to risk their lives every day for photographs that they sold f .. $10 apiece . At that point the Green Berets were the exotic jungle fighters that the war hero President Kennedy had championed , and both Flynn and Stone spent a lot of time with them , although their officers were very particular about whom among the press corps they allowed into their encampment . As Stone wrote his parents : " Spent December traveling with Special Forces . . . . Learned about cooking rice in a piece of bamboo and cooking dogs by simply hitting them . , n the head and throwing them in the fire . I learned @#  | about eating eggs that were already half chicken and I could possibly transplant a banana tree . I also learned 40 different ways to make a man tell you things he 'd rather not . " On one patrol Flynn wrote about , some Green Berets had shot some cows because they feared their mooing would be a cover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the cows remained standing after they were shot . For the rest of his life , Flynn said , he would remember their enormous uncomprehending eyes staring at him in terror . Flynn finished killing the cows with his own pistol , explaining that he had begun to learn the real bestiality of war : if he had not killed the cows , they might have caused his own death . Stone delighted in telling stories that shocked the phony sensibilities of those around him . A GI shot a little boy on a patrol Stone was on once , but he said there was great confusion about what to do with the kid since the American pilots would not carry him out without a civilian escort . Then they spotted a lost little girl and put her on the helicopter with him , without a thought for who or where their parents might have been . Another story Stone told was about seeing a GI get shot in the balls . Here it was , the ultimate war wound , and what should he do with his camera in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for maybe a few seconds ) but went ahead and took the pictures of the young man in supreme agony . But then , and this is the point of the story , the soldier yelled for Stone to come over . He was sure the fellow would ask him for his film , but no , he wanted copies of the pictures . The high of war BOTH FLYNN AND STONE were too close to the realities of the war not to be aware of the dangers it presented . But survival in such circumstances is really the most splendid of highs . And they both thrived on this . Although they would leave many times , they would always return to the war . Flynn had planned to be in Vietnam only a few weeks when he first arrived , then he said in his Paris-Match article he would stay two more months , but it was seven months later when he took off for Singapore to star in another film , this one called Cinq Gars Pour Singapore . He returned to Saigon for a few months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Palm Beach , where his mother and friends say he talked very little about the war . He even told some of them that he was through with drugs , through with the war . Several times , he did give up drugs ? once telling a friend how he bought a kilo of grass in Vientiane , brought it to his room , rubbed it in his hair and all over his body , threw it up in the air , and said goodbye to it forever . But always he would return to drugs , just as he would . return to the war . Stone , meanwhile , had been plotting his fir escape from the war . He wrote his parents in t. spring of 1967 , " I 'm not sure whether or not Fr : . finished in Vietnam ? it looks as though the war will last a while , a long while , but I 'm not sure that I would , and the risks were getting way out of proportion to the gains . I seemed to be gettinz the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became more accustomed to the war what had initially been interesting and exciting became dull and frightening . " Stone took off on a truly cursed ship called the Conqueror , where knife fights among the international crew became part of the ship 's routine . After several months without pay , the crew seized the ship in Hong Kong , and Stone never did collect more than $1,000 owed him . He went back to a staff photography job with UPI in Vietnam and in a few months had saved up enough to fly Smiser from Spain , get married ( January 10 , 1968 ) at the embassy in Bangkok , and then settle into a two-room villa in Danang with a brand-new Honda motorcycle for the family car . Stone insisted that Smiser know all about his experiences because one day she , too , would go back and say she had seen a war . A few days after they were back in Danang , nearby rocket blasts signaling the Tet offensive shook them out of bed . Stone put her behind him on the motorcycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted she take a camera and photograph a man who had been decapitated by an M16 fired at close range . Later , he took her along on a visit to the First Air Cavalry Division base camp . They ate canned rations with the enlisted men for lunch , and then they were guests at the general 's mess for dinner ? a near-formal affair , complete with cocktails and wine , and seven courses up to tutti-frutti ice cream . Stone was a real hero among the fellows in the Public Information Office tent , and later that night they were all chatting away with their old buddy ? leaving a new guy standing by . rather lost and lonely without any experiences to reexplore . Smiser did n't have much of a war to talk about either , and so she talked to the new kid about backhome . The base was hit with rockets and mortars that night , and Smiser 's new friend was splattered all over the inside of the press tent . Stone insisted that she go in and look ? though it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job . I arrived in Saigon the night before the Tet offensive began , and I was in Khe Sanh the next week and in Hue the week after that . Stone and I first became comrades when he saw me getting off a supply boat in Hue . The boat had taken several hits , and some Vietnamese soldiers beside me were wounded : I had passed my test of fire . By the time I knew them , both Flynn and  | @# Stone had moved beyond the gun-toting stage of weir early Green Beret adventures and were : . oth getting more and more involved with the Vietnamese civilians and their lives . Stone and Smiser had a real house and a landlord and neighbors and had to shop in Vietnamese markets , which involved them in day-to-day contact with civilians . Stone said in a tape to his parents , " I do n't Know , shootin 's not much fun anymore . I do n't think huntin ' will be much fun either . I 'd sure like to see some of those sporty people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen . They ought a come over here where you 're fishng with a hook in your mouth too . " Flynn 's friend Carl Robinson an AP photo editor who had quit his civilian job with USAID and had married a Vietnamese woman named Kim Dung ? and his wife would take Flynn along on visits to her family in the village of Go Gong deep in the delta below Saigon . And through John Steinbeck IV , a young GI who later worked for Dispatch News and as a soundman for CBS , Flynn was introduced to the many religions found in Vietnam . Steinbeck would later say Flynn saved him decades of learning about " living with a name that is only partly your own . " By this time it was late 1968 and the war was no longer news ? what with the Columbia rebellion and " Chicago " backhome and the peace talks getting under way in Paris . So Stone who had switched from UPI to the AP in early summer and Flynn and I all made plans to leave before the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wandering around the other countries in the Orient . Stone and Smiser had two or three months to wait for their new Volkswagen camper to arrive in Singapore . They hitchhiked from Singapore up the western coast of Malaysia through Thailand to the northern juncture of Thailand , Burma , and Laos . Then they went to Vientiane and along the Mekong River down through southern Laos , and across Cambodia . Finally , they hitched back down the eastern coast of Malaysia to Singapore , where they boarded an old deck passenger ship for Madras . They said goodbye to me in Singapore in March 1969 and , so it seemed , left the East forever . Flynn , meanwhile , had merely crossed over the border into the still untroubled countryside of Cambodia . He spent days and weeks bicycling around the massive ruins of Angkor Wat photographing , measuring , just getting stoned and absorbing all the mystery of the place . He once wrote his mother from there , " We are all God 's toys ? you , me , Cambodia . He had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laos ? down roads even the CIA was afraid to travel ( " just groovin ' on the danger , - he would explain 1 ? before I saw him that last time in April of 1969 . We flew hack to Saigon the next day to stand beside Page , then Flynn helped pack up Page 's belongings , wrote his own will , and just lived out his days in a romantic routine that Graham Greene , Somerset Maugham , and countless others had enjoyed in the city before us . This included breakfast in the Cafe Pagode , then a two- or three-hour drink of citron and soda or pastis and water , in a tall glass , on the wide open terrace of the Hotel Continental , then maybe a beer in the Casino Bar down Nguyen Thien Street across Tu Do from our apartment . There was a friendly bartender in the Casino who would hand across joints dipped in opium for us to smoke whenever we walked in with Flynn . And there were the coveys of girls who would stand off and giggle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( His films were often showing at the main cinema , the Rex . and the bargirls would say he did n't look like himself without his guns or he looked older with the moustache . ) In July of 1969 , Flynn was assigned by Time to take photographs of President Nixon 's visit to Indonesia . Stone by this time was four months into his trip to Sweden and had already written me and others that he was tired of the scenery , yearning for the good-gone days of Vietnam . He and Smiser had progressed through India . Nepal . Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iran . Turkey . and Greece and were headed on up to that imagined logging camp . When they finally got to northern Sweden , they found that every little town was clean and electrified and civilized ? nothing like the grungy outposts they had sought . And the only job Stone could get was marking trees . because they said he was too small to handle the logs ( that looked like saplings compared to the giant redwoods he had worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months before Flynn made the same decision for different reasons , Stone turned around and went back to Vietnam . @# STONE HAD NEVER USED a television camera before and had always spoken with more contempt for the " TV guys " than he had for the " writer guys . " He explained in a tape to his parents , " The TV guy , the talker guy , is always some fat old guy who does n't wanta walk , does n't wanta stay out in the field or anything .... " But back in Vietnam he found his old buddy Keith Kay , a CBS cameraman who was as daring as Stone and , more important , had also worked once as a logger near Sawyer 's Bar . Stone was able to get free-lance assignments from CBS and , with Kay 's instruction , was shooting top-quality action footage that was being used on the Walter Cronkite show by the time Smiser could get their luggage from the camper hack home to Kentucky . She stayed a few days at home , then joined " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tu Do Street . Stone was out in the field shooting f " Charlie Company " when Flynn arrived back Saigon from his Indonesia assignment . Flynn had let his hair grow long and it w bleached blond from the Bali sun , and he was trim and healthy as anybody had ever seen hi : Jack Laurence , the young and talented CF correspondent who was doing the " Charlie Col pany " documentary , quickly tried to convin Flynn to join the crew and go back to the fie . with them . Flynn was skeptical as he sat in the Tu Do Street apartment , rolling one joint aft , another and passing them around on a worn col of Chairman Mao 's red book . He said he did n't want to cover war anymore , that he did n't real . need the money . Finally he agreed to go alone for a few days . Stone had meanwhile departed for Cambodia , where a whole new war was sure to follow the U.S.-supported coup that had overthrown the government of neutralist Prince Norodom . Sihanouk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurence woke up one mornin : to find him crouched over a Stars and Stripe story headlined : " NVA ADVANCES ON PHNOM " PENH . " Flynn envisioned tank fights in the streetof Phnom Penh and , he told Laurence , he had t be there when it happened . He flew to Phnom Penh and moved into Stone 's room in the old Hotel Royale , the center of a lively group of journalists who had always considered the city their favorite spot in Southeast Asia . Flynn had been sent on a free-lance assignment by Time , and Stone was working aa CBS soundman because the company already had a cameraman there . Smiser arrived a few days after Flynn , April 4 , 1970 , in fact , a wildly happy day and night that overshadows all her other memories now because it was the last night she spent with her husband . Smiser and Stone made love in their room , then went out and bought all kinds of wine and cheese to drink and eat beside the pool . That night , when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , so they took off their clothes , dived in , and then made love under the open sky . Flynn woke them early the next morning . He and Stone had rented two bright red motorcycles for the trip ( about two hours from Phnom Penh ) to the border towns . They discussed everything they packed because Flynn had a particular story in mind ( the U.S. bombing weeks before the actual invasion ) , and he wanted them t ( look as little like journalists as possible . Flynn : wore flip-flop sandals , short pants , T-shirt , and floppy jungle hat ; Stone wore sneakers , dungarees , a T-shirt , and Smiser 's hat , which she had gotten from a " survival " kit all American pilotcarry .

" It was a bright , very pretty sunny day , " Dyckerman recalls , " and all the peasants were out working in the fields . They were waving and smiling for photographs . " There had been a line of Cambodian troops , tanks , and armored cars at the roadblock when Dyckerman started out . ( The Vietcong apparently had withdrawn to the nearest treeline to watch the show . ) Then , without ever firing a shot , the Cambodians began a casual retreat smiling and waving for Dyckerman to take their pictures . Flynn and Stone were left standing alone at the roadblock . The Cambodians sauntered back past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up beside him and the driver started yelling frantically for him to get in because of " Vietcong ! Vietcong ! " Women and children were still along the road and Dyckerman saw no need for alarm , but it was his only ride back to Phnom Penh , so he waved goodbye to Flynn and Stone , got in his taxi , and left . Later , three members of a French television crew were walking up the same road . Flynn spotted them and started back . The cameraman turned on his camera , and in Paris there is a film that shows Flynn warning them , " Pathet Lao ! Pathet Lao ! " The only explanation for his confusion ( Pathet Lao instead of Vietcong or Khmer Rouge ) is that he was in unfamiliar territory or that he was downright scared . There is no sign of Stone in the film , but Flynn turns around and rides back toward the roadblock . The French crew returned to Paris to write a sensational story , headlined : " THEY OWE THEIR LIVES TO SEAN , SON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FOLLOWED their disappearance that sunny afternoon , April 6. 1970 . A former colleague sent a telegram saying , " Poor Smiser , she gets only sympathy here . Suppose you heard the story of two Caucasians found tortured and crucified in the area . " Nobody bothered to squash the rumor later after it turned out to be two French priests the rightwing Cambodians had crucified . There seemed to be a " special hurry , " as Hemingway said of men in another time , for these two to be killed off , for the others who had shared their experience to know for certain they had " gotten theirs " for their extra daring . To this date , there is no definite information that they are dead , yet the National Enquirer talked with a number of their colleagues for a story in March of this year , reporting , " Most of young Flynn 's fellow newsmen and photographers and friends in Southeast Asia believe he is dead . " A full month after Flynn and Stone were captured , three other reporters were taken prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a reckless young adventurer . He was Richard Dudman ? who is fifty-two , bald , and Washington bureau chief of the St. Louis Post-Dispatchand he has written about his capture : " I am optimistic by nature and felt elated at the prospect of getting my first look at the other side of a war I had been writing about for ten years . . . . ' If we get out of this alive , ' I said , we 'll have one hell of a story . ' " These three were released after forty days as prisoners of the North Vietnamese-Khmer Rouge-Vietcong forces , but they were given no information at all about Flynn or Stone or the other correspondents who had been captured in the area . A committee of well-known American journalists ( Walter Cronkite is the chairman , and he carried leaflets about the missing men to leave with his hosts on the President 's trip to China ) has been able to assemble enough data to prove that several of the captured journalists were not killed on sight , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zalin Grant , a former Army intelligence officer fluent in Vietnamese who later worked for Time and the New Republic , interviewed hundreds of villagers in the area as well as defectors from the Communist forces and soldiers captured during the American invasion of the same area . By correlating information from the interviews , Grant was able to trace the route by which six journalists were taken back from the border front to a village near Kratie City , through which Stone and Smiser had hitchhiked just a year earlier . There , on May 31 , 1970 , they were last seen by a North Vietnamese soldier who later defected and said , " It was about dusk when they brought them to the house , and we were stationed around there and we came to see what was going on . ' When we asked the Cong An security guards they told us these were journalists captured in April on Highway 1 . " One of the journalists , the defector said , " had a light yellow-brown moustache and long sideburns . His hair was long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach was not very big . I heard he was American . " The defector also mentioned that two of the guards rode bright red motorcycles . This report provided hope that Flynn was all right , but another report had it that Stone had been badly wounded during an American bombing raid and was laid up in some field prison with an open stomach wound requiring skin grafts that the guerrilla medics could not handle . Personal appeals to Sihanouk in Peking failed to confirm the report , and after a long exchange with Smiser ( who was in touch with his mother and children under house arrest in Phnom Penh ) he admitted that he was out of touch with his shadow government in Cambodia . A Dutch adventurer who claimed to have traveled with Regis Debray in Bolivia had brought out the report about Stone . This was Johannes Duynisfeld , who was released with a group of French journalists who had been captured several weeks after Flynn and Stone were captured . The Establishment journalists di-counted Duynisfeld 's stories mainly because of his disheveled appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he had written in his diaries . But , after he described Stone 's odd-shaped feet ( a detail he could not have overheard in a bar ) , Smiser was more than willing to go along in his game of intrigue that involved secret meetings with men of connections in Phnom Penh , Bangkok , and Vientiane . She bought everything on Duynisfeld 's list of medicines needed for the operations , and one morning in Phnom Penh she put $20 ( that. - all he asked for ) in his hand and wished him . well as he set off on a bicycle for the other side of the war . Three months later , Smiser had not heard from Duynisfeld , so she followed his instructions and wrote to a friend of his in Holland and : to Sihanouk . Then , one afternoon , a man who reads faces came by the Tu Do Street apartment , and she asked him to examine a photograph of Duynisfeld and tell her if this was an honest man . The man who reads faces examined the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Two days later , Smiser found out that Duynisfeld had been killed by South Vietnamese and American troops that very afternoon . A Vietnamese photographer had retrieved his diaries that told of his training for a " mission " for the guerrilla forces . But the only evidence of his mission to find Stone and bring him out was a notation that the town where they were supposed to meet had been destroyed by American bombs . The man who reads faces had also examined photographs of Flynn and Stone . For Flynn , he said , it was not an unusual year . For Stone , it was a very bad year , " but if he can live through this year ... " When I talked with Flynn in my dream , I had mentioned this story about Stone 's stomach wound and Flynn had laughed aloud as he rarely did . " Stone 's all right , " Flynn had said . " He just took a little gaff . " " Gaff . " It was a word I never used and its unfamiliar sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word . " rough treatment , abuse , " was comforting . And since then there have been other dreams . In one , Stone and other friends and I are camped out in some wilderness spot and he is telling me he does n't want to talk about his capture , as if it ? and my story are embarrassing to him . In another dream , Flynn and I discuss the story ? " funny how all those people would say those things . " he says , " and none of them add up to me. "
