All students were given personality tests . Those whose self-esteem was bolstered by praise for their performance chose the tape . But students who were derided ( sample comment : " It 's clear you really do n't have very good social skills " ) overwhelmingly chose to be bound and shocked . <P> In another study , Frieden managed to delude some students into thinking they were masochists . Asked to choose between the tape and the shock , they picked the shock by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat a dead worm Frieden dangled in front of them . The reason , he thinks , is that they were anxious to learn if they were indeed masochists . In general , Frieden concludes , it is surprisingly easy to push normal people toward masochism . Says he : " When feeling bad about themselves , people actively choose to suffer . " The good news is that none of the students received an electric shock or dined on worm . Frieden stopped the test when the newborn masochists made their choice .
