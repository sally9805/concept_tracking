Carter 's aides favor freeing up prices but differ on how much , how soon <P> In spite of all the talk about the need for an energy policy , the U.S. remains maddeningly vulnerable to fuel cutoffs . <P> Last week brought yet more evidence of that depressing fact as new petroperils were turning up everywhere . <P> Continuing a rash of price-gouging moves by many oil nations , Nigeria , the fourth largest producer in the 13-nation OPEC cartel , indicated that it was planning to tack on an export surcharge of perhaps as much as 17% . That advance will add further pressure for a fresh round of inflationary increases early next week , when OPEC ministers plan to meet in Geneva . Indeed , by an ironic White House oversight , Carter is expected the same day to play host to the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace accords in Washington . Arab hardliners , such as Iraq , Algeria and Libya , could well be tempted to try to upstage the treaty signing by clamoring for huge new price increases , supply cutbacks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand now . Though most U.S. gasoline stations still have enough fuel on hand to meet the demands , oil company deliveries are rapidly being pared back to stretch dwindling inventories . Exxon 's supplies are becoming so tight that last week the company had to impose an $8 limit on gas purchases at its stations along the heavily traveled New Jersey Turnpike . Exxon also said it would not renew crude-oil supply contracts with other companies , a step that is going to make it harder for the firms that have been cut off to meet their own commitments . <P> The authoritative petroleum industry weekly , the Lundberg Letter , offered a grim forecast of just how hard-and how quickly-the U.S. is likely to be hurt by the tightening oil squeeze . Using regular-sales tax data supplied by state governments , the letter warned that by the end of next week there would be a shockingly large shortfall of 8.9% in gasoline supplies . A rush by panicky motorists to gas up would virtually guarantee long , temper-fraying lines reminiscent of the 1973-74 Arab oil-embargo days . Hoarding would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel prices . <P> If Washington had any quick-fix cures to offer , they were not apparent . In the Senate , a group of Administration critics led by Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum seemed content simply to badger and goad Energy Secretary James Schlesinger , variously recommending that he either quit or be fired as ineffectual . One of Schlesinger 's biggest embarrassments : DOE 'S strategic petroleum reserve , which is supposed to be available in times of severe shortage but is years behind schedule and contains less than a week 's worth of oil . Pumps to get the crude back out of the huge underground Louisiana and Texas salt domes , where it is stored , will not be installed until September , if then . <P> In another example of energy trouble and vulnerability , the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the immediate shutdown of five mid-Atlantic and New England nuclear power generators on the statistically improbable grounds that an earthquake might occur near by and cause them to pour out radioactive materials . U.S. oil consumption will quickly jump by 100,000 bbl. a day as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
