TOUCH AND GO <P> Directed by PHILIPPE DE BROCA Screenplay by JEAN-LOUP DABADIE <P> Lighter than helium and just about as dense , this adventure farce is a pleas ant enough way to pass a little time . Di rector Philippe de Broca ( That Man from Rio , Cartouche ) has a blithe liking for unlikely situations and hapless heroics . <P> Here , a French gunrunner ( Michel Piccoli ) and a British officer ( Michael York ) dash about North Africa during the early days of World War II , trying to avoid the Germans and get back to safety . Our boys do fairly well for themselves , but the stresses of escape and pursuit weigh heavily . " Let 's surrender , " suggests the Englishman after a particularly grueling day . " Why ? " asks his French ally . " Because , ' says the Englishman with invincible and poignant common sense , " I 'm hungry . " <P> Adding edge to quite another type of appetite is their third companion , the wife of the Swiss ambassador ( Marlene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride past the German checkpoint , where things do not go well . The Germans are suspicious , and the wife tears off into the desert like an ace getaway driver . The bullets fly , and it is all great fun . Jobert also takes a shine to her two anxious soldiers of fortune , although which one she truly loves becomes a source of good-humored competition . <P> Touch and Go remains casual about matters of plot , however , and gets lazy in its joking . There are too many Italian-army gags , for example , all having to do with stupidity or cowardice . Even more drastic , the film has an insinuating cuteness , like De Broca 's much-cherished King of Hearts . De Broca works hard at being likable , and makes it , finally , alto gether too easy .
