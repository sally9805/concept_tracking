Europe 's third biggest beer , whisky and wine company , London-based Watney Mann , has grown rapidly with the lift of a catchy slogan : " We want Watney 's . " Nobody takes that slogan more to heart than Maxwell Joseph , a former army lance corporal who is one of Britain 's richest entrepreneurs . Joseph is chairman of Grand Metropolitan Hotels , and he wants to buy Watney 's so badly he can taste it . He has made two takeover bids for the company , and the latest , due to expire this week , is worth $ 1 billion of his company 's securities . <P> Joseph 's chances of gaining control heightened last week when another bidder dropped out . The Rank Organization-a movie producer and hotel operator that depends for most of its profits on its 49% ownership of Rank-Xerox , the European giant in copy machines-had offered $1.1 billion . Some banks and mutual funds in the U.S. and Europe had bought Rank stock for the Xerox profits and feared a dilution in earnings if the company acquired Watney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid . <P> Frothy Empire . By contrast , Joseph , 62 , has long had a fancy for beer . Last year he won a takeover battle for the London brewing firm of Truman . His defeated opponent in that fight : Michael Webster , chairman of Watney 's . The Truman shareholders got Joseph 's Grand Metropolitan stock and have seen its market value rise by 160% in a year . Small wonder that Joseph claims " Watney 's shareholders would be better off if there were a merger . " Naturally , Watney 's Webster denies that . He proudly points to Watney 's size and prospects : sales last year of $780 million and a predicted rise of 27% in earnings this year , from enterprises that range from 6,000 pubs in Britain to the distilleries that make Gilbey 's gin and J. &; B. Scotch . <P> If Joseph 's past accomplishments are any guide , the Watney shareholders must find his offer tempting . Starting in 1944 , he parlayed a few thousand dollars into a huge empire . He bought one hotel , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizing up property . " It 's something that can never be taught , " he says . He charged modest prices for hotel rooms , counting on high occupancy rates to turn a profit . As he puts it : " I just do n't believe in charging up to the hilt . " Today he controls a hotel , restaurant , food , beer and gambling network that spreads into France , Belgium , The Netherlands , Italy , Monaco and to New York ( the Royal Manhattan Hotel on Eighth Avenue ) . Last year , on revenues of $818 million , his Grand Metropolitan Ltd. earned $33 million net , up 62% from the previous year . <P> A modest man , Joseph dislikes personal publicity so much that his photo does not even appear in Grand Met 's annual report . His only boast is that he works a mere four hours a day . He delegates as much authority as possible . " I do not want to become a prisoner of wealth , weighed down by responsibility , " he says . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubs that he owns personally . He also reads voraciously , and has a large collection of novels with plots that are set in hotels .
