Each year more and more American elm trees , which once lined hundreds of town squares , fall victim to Dutch elm disease . Last year the apparently incurable blight destroyed at least half a million trees in the U.S. This summer the pestilence may be worse ; it has spread from the East through the South and Midwest and is now attacking trees as far west as Denver . <P> After every other remedy failed ( including such folksy " cures " as injecting trees with turpentine or whacking galvanized nails into their trunks ) , scientists believe they have found a way to stop the fungus that causes the disease and the elm-bark beetles that spread it . The new approach involves two steps : spraying dormant elms in early spring with a pesticide called methoxychlor , which is lethal to the beetle but harmless to most other insects , and then spraying again in June with a chemical called Benlate , which attacks only the fungus . Instead of spraying , the arborist may also inject Benlate directly into the tree trunk , which puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing the treatment on 600 elms in a Milwaukee suburb for two years , University of Wisconsin researchers report that the mortality rate for the trees has dropped from 5% per year to 2% . <P> Benlate itself is not completely new . <P> For two years it has been used as a fungicide to protect roses and tomatoes . What is new-officially approved only this March by the U.S. Department of Agriculture-is its application to Dutch elm disease . The problem now is to persuade communities and private tree owners to undertake the effort and expense ( $75 per tree per year ) needed to make the treatment work . When John Hansel , executive director of the Elm Research Institute , took the cure to Denver last February , the mayor refused to see him . The city had its own method for treating the disease-simply cut down and burn infected trees . Says Hansel : " We 've come a lot farther in dealing with the beetle than we have with the politicians .
