When they got the report cards this winter , the parents of children in the Banneker grade school in Gary , Indiana , found something missing : the grade of " F " - for " failure . " In fact , there was only one grade possible : " S " for " satisfactory . " That meant that the child performed and progressed to the full measure of his ability . " The criterion here is 100 percent , " says Mrs. Deborah Jones of the Banneker school staff . " If we do our job properly , the child should have no trouble in getting 100 percent . " Here in the drear streets of south Gary-a place of clay-hardened vegetable patches and rickety one-family homes-one of the most venturesome and exhilarating experiments in education is taking place . It is a school without teachers , without grades , without a principal , and without the constant experience of failure . It is , most remarkably of all , a school run by private enterprise : it is not a private school ; it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a private corporation to see if it could find new ways to educate children that are better than the old ways . The old ways clearly were not working : at Banneker three-fourths of the children could not read as well as the average child the same age in the rest of the country ? - and with every year of education they were falling farther and farther behind the average . At Banneker , a private-enterprise system turned that around in just one year : A sure sign of interest in her schoolwork is shown in this child 's concentration . three-fourths of the children were learning to read as well or better than the national average . One of the ways that Banneker has achieved this is by shifting the focus and meaning of education to the individual child . " At most schools , when a child fails , it 's assumed to be the child 's fault , " says Dr. Brian Fitch , the school manager-not principal-at Banneker . " Here at Banneker , if a child fails it 's our fault . And we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most controversial - and hated - words in education : accountability . It is a conviction that somebody-the teachers , the school administrations , the school boards-should be held to account for what is accomplished in the schools of the nation . For this nation is spending more money without corresponding results in education than any other country in history : some $60 to $70 billions a year goes into the public school system- " as much as the rest of the world together , " said President Nixon-and every year the school system turns out tens of thousands of high-school graduates who ca n't read the diplomas they 're handed . By now , the U.S. Office of Education has estimated , there are 24 million people eighteen years old or older in the United States who are " functionally illiterate . " That means they can not read , write , or count well enough to handle the day-to-day tasks demanded of them in modern society : they can not count enough to make change in a cafeteria , they can not read well enough to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not count the streets or read the street signs well enough to know when to get off the bus and transfer to another . Yet it is n't because they have n't gone to school . There are only 6.4 million Americans fourteen years old and over who have n't gone through at least the fifth grade . So the inescapable conclusion is that the vast majority of those 24 million " functionally illiterate " people had gone to school for at least five years  --  but learned little except to hate school . The concept of " accountability " holds that somebody must be held responsible not only for spending money on schools but for the way the schools perform . For the implications are clear : by failing to teach even the simplest academic skills , the schools are turning out academic failures who will eventually become " life failures " ? people whose reading and math skills are so poor that they ca n't possibly hold a job in a modern technological society . Many of those millions will eventually go on the welfare rolls  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are providing a climate where failure is " normal " : the only thing some kids learn in school is how to do nothing . One response to this situation was the offer of a money-back guarantee by certain private corporations to go into the schools and upgrade the children 's reading or math skills so that the kids are no longer losing ground to the rest of the country . This is called " performance contracting , " and it is one of the most infectious , innovative , and controversial concepts in education . Just over two years ago , there was only one performance contract in the nation ; by last autumn there were 170 of them , and the U.S. government  --  after investing $6.5 million on performance contracts in twenty-one areas  --  asked the Rand Corporation to study their implications . For there was a genuine concern that such fast growth would lead to abuses : one performance contractor went into a school system in the Southwest and not only motivated the kids materially  --  by giving them transistor radios and other gifts for performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers that would eventually appear on their performance test . Of course , there were many in the Byzantine bureaucracy of public education who hated the very concept of " accountability " that is inherent in performance contracting ; they , especially the unions , resented and resisted the notion that private enterprise can improve the quality of education when their own failure has endured through the years . " Education isn'tfought the concept of accountability and performance standards even when administered by public authority . In Washington , D.C. , teachers attacked and managed to dilute a proposal that would have tried to raise the shameful levels of reading and math skills of children in that city by rewarding good teachers for good performance ( some would have been paid as much as principals ) instead of for seniority or for the number of advanced degrees they held . ( The local teachers ' union accused the school board of trying to " dupe " the people of Washington through a " criminal action . " ) But private enterprise seemed to some teachers to pose a more awesome threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the president of the 228,000-member American Federation of Teachers , termed performance contracting " pseudo-free enterprise " and called it " the work of fly-by-night companies ... formed by people who learned that there 's money in performance contracting . " The companies which ventured into performance contracting included subsidiaries of IBM , Westinghouse , the Singer Company , and the McGraw-Hill publishing company . In all cases  --  outside of Gary  --  the performance con-tractors were asked to do a selected and selective job : to upgrade specifically the reading level or the math level of a given set of children . Gary is the first city to turn over an entire school to a performance contractor . It felt a profound need to inspire new ideas and a fresh enterprise : school costs were going up at 15 to 20 percent a year and school results were going down . " We are at rock bottom and must try new approaches to educate our children , " said Dr. Alfonso D. Holliday II , president co the school board . " We must be willing to be pioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The corporation chosen by the school hoard in Gary was Behavioral Research Laboratories Inc. , of Palo Alto , California and New York City . Organized in 1961 by Allen Calvin , a one-time psychology professor who is now board chairman of the company , BRL created and sold textbooks and learning material ( Project Read , Project Math , Project Learn ) to some 100 major school systems in the country . ( Gary had already contracted for Project Read in certain of its schools . ) BRL was willing to take over Banneker school lock , stock . and barrel . It manages and operates the building ? " We do everything around here from cleaning the toilets to changing the light bulbs , " says Dr. Fitch  --  and it pays $55,000 a year rent to Gary for the use of the school . In Banneker it acquired , if not the worst school in town , at least the next thing to being worst : Banneker ranked thirty-fifth among the thirty-six elementary schools in Gary . ( The reason that BRL did not take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . BRL insisted that it had to have at least 150 days of attendance from each child in the school or it could not guarantee its performance . The worst school did n't have that kind of attendance , but Banneker , as next to last , did . ) Banneker is an all-black school in a section of Gary that is not only black and poor but getting poorer . With the shutdown of the steel mills in and around Gary because of the national economic slump , the unemployment rate in the Banneker school area has been estimated as being as high as 52 percent , or nine times as high as the national average . Thus the neighborhood has a climate of failure and frustration that is communicated all too easily to the climate of the school . What BRL insisted on doing was changing that climate altogether-to inspire a sense of success in the school and in the children . It would take approaches that were not only fresh but unprecedented ; that was the advantage of coming in from the outside with none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , BRL did away with the - principal " -philosophically , not physically . It considered his job an almost impossible one : he had not only to select and shape the educational system in the school but to manage the building , motivate the teachers , discipline the students and pacify the parents . BRL broke these responsibilities into two jobs . To one of them-that called the " school manager " - it assigned the bones and muscle of the educational environment : he handles building management , he selects the educational materials and decides who on the faculty will work in what . He oversees the use of the rooms-how the chairs and desks are grouped , for BRL was not about to use the traditional classroom of the " old " kind of school-and determines how the whole environment can be improved . ( Does one room or one corridor need more cheerful lighting or a different decor ? ) He simply designs and assembles all the components that go into the educational system of the school . To the other-called the " learning director " - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he works with the students and the faculty in the classrooms , laboring to see that the system installed by the school manager is working well and to its particular purpose . ( " After all , a learning director must direct the learning , " says Shermen Newell of Banneker school . ) He also handles the disciplinary problems and the parents and even the teachers who may need to be motivated toward or enlightened about the changes that are taking place in the school . BRL decided that the school manager , Dr. Fitch this year , should come out of its resources ; he is a young , thin , percipient white who grew up in Minnesota . It decided that the learning director should come out of the Gary school system 's resources : Shermen Newell is a stocky , muscular , percipient black who grew up in the Gary schoolsystem . " We function on the same level , with the same degree of responsibility , " says Dr. Fitch , " but in different areas of the school climate . " The next thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the historic concept of their role . They changed their method of working from lecturing to classes to tutoring with individuals . They were redesignated and trained as " curriculum managers . " BRL reduced their number from thirty-six in the " old " Banneker school to twenty ' last year ( and twenty-five this year ) . They supplemented them in the classroom with " learning supervisors " - mothers of children in the school , who circulate through the classrooms helping the children with the less-exalted problems , ranging from whether they can go to the bathroom to whether they should put an " e " on " strange " in their workbook . The " learning supervisors " are not trained as teachers ; their function is to take as much of the nonteaching workload as possible off the teachers ' backs and allow the educational aspects of the classroom to remain sharply focused for a longer period of time . They are paid about $3,000 a school year by BRL ( compared to the minimum of $10,000 a school year paid the " curriculum managers " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the school , twenty-five in all . But in no way do they replace the curriculum manager : under the Banneker school system , a trained teacher is still responsible for decisions about learning in the classroom and dealing with the children , as well as their parents . All this was just a start-but it was enough to ignite a blaze of resentment and controversy . The state said that it would withdraw all state aid to Gary schools if BRL was allowed to go forward with its plans . But the Gary school board pointed out that BRL would , under the contract , meet every aspect and every standard demanded by the state-and the state relented . Then the local teachers ' union began talking strike because of the number of teachers ' jobs that had been eliminated at Banneker school . But both BRL and the school board pointed out that every " curriculum manager " at the school had been onthe " old " teaching staff at Banneker-that BRL had not gone outside the school or the Gary school system to find its curriculum managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers who did n't stay on ? " They transferred to other schools in Gary , " says Brian Fitch . Why ? " Some of them were at a stage in their careers where they genuinely did n't want to undertake a significant change in teaching systems ; some of them simply felt that there 'd be additional work that they did n't want to take on . " ) BRL also pointed out that the faculty did not go on merit pay ; they do not draw their pay based on pupil performance ( as was suggested in Washington ) . Each curriculum manager is paid exactly as she 'd be paid at any other school in Gary with one exception : she is also paid for any overtime she puts in , which is rarely the case at other schools throughout the country . But the climactic moment came at a tempestuous school-board meeting at which a black woman , the mother of a child at Banneker , rose and said in effect : " This is our last hope for our children . You ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plea which touched teacher and administrator alike . The local teachers ' union is led by a black woman who understands the need of hope . So the teachers ' union , which had been considering the most militant and drastic of actions to close the Banneker school , quietly relented and sat back to see how the experiment would work out . Back at Banneker , BRL imple. merited other changes that were ti arouse hope- - and fear . At the heart of those changes wa , a profound shift in focus . No longer was the school run to accommodate the teachers ; it was run to educate the individual child . The difference is this : historically , American schools , from kindergarten to college , have been set up so that the teacher teaches what she wants to teach or state or local authorities prescribe-neither of which may be what the child needs to learn or is able to learn . The system decides what they 're going to talk about in class and the children have no choice but to adapt to it ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relevant . ( And some teachers still use lesson plans designed many years ago . ) This leads to a grotesque grading gap in which the teacher scores the child on what he 's learned of what the teacher wanted or was told to teach , not what the child wanted or was able to learn . So the failure of a child is really in many cases the failure of a teacher to understand his needs , interests and abilities . One way that BRL shifted the focus to the child and his individual needs was by ending the system of grades in the Banneker school . Banneker is still the primary school for its neighborhood ; it still serves children who would normally be in anything from kindergarten to sixth grade . The kindergarten is still there , but there is no first grade or sixth grade or anything in between . Basically , the old " grade system " is a method of distributing children by age instead of by readiness and ability to learn . The old method makes it easy on the teachers but difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are vast differences in ability among children of the same age : some can draw better , others can read better , still others can use figures better , some can see and hear better . Banneker decided simply to separate the children by what they knew  --  or did n't know  --  rather than by age . In that way , the time each child spent in school could be used in learning what he needed to and could learn , not what a school administrator many miles away decided that a child of his age should be taught . Thus the " classes " in reading and math at Banneker are made up of children of all ages but of roughly the same learning level . A class in very basic and early reading might have children who are six or eight or ten years old  --  or even twelve  --  and all of whom are learning to read at their own particular rate . Take Lloyd Brewer : he was nine years old when he entered the " new " Banneker school in September , 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old system . But he could n't read even first-grade material ; he 'd just been passed along until he could be passed up and out of the school system  --  and onto the welfare rolls . BRL perceived that it would do no good to ask him to read fourth-grade material . That would be merely " teaching " him to fail  --  to become more baffled and frustrated by what he could n't do rather than be elevated by what he could do . Under BRL , he was guided to first-grade reading material but not to " first grade . " The other children in his reading class were of all ages : six and seven , some nine , ten , and eleven years old . The one thing they had in common was the need to learn to read on a very basic level . But because they were all learning and working individually  --  and being tutored that way  --  instead of in a thirty-five-or fifty-child classroom , they were free to move ahead as fast as they could . It turned out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thirteen months under the " new " Banneker system , he moved up roughly three grades ( using the old measure ) in reading skills , so that he was doing about as well as the average child his age . " It was really a remarkable advance for any child , " says Mrs. Jones . Other children need and want to learn well beyond their age and grade level . Debra Johnson is eleven years old and would be a sixth-grader in the " old " Banneker school . She would also be bored by sixth-grade math . For she has a math capability far beyond her years . At the new Banneker , she does n't take " sixth-grade math " she studies math for people on the junior-high and high-school level  --  BRL went out and assembled the materials that would challenge her intellectually so that she could advance at the learning pace that was best for her . Still other children need to learn some things on one level and other things on another level . Tonette Williams is seven years old , normally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with other children her age . But she also is advanced well beyond her years in mathematics : at the new Banneker school she studies reading on the seven-year-old level , but she studies math on a level usually associated with ten- and eleven-yea r-olds . Altogether , there are 733 children in Banneker school this year and each of them has a learning program that is as individual as the smile on his face . It is called a " prescription " and if the child follows that prescription faithfully  --  as a patient would follow a doctor 's prescription  --  then he can not fail . For that prescription guides him through exactly the material that he needs most to learn at the pace at which he can most efficiently learn . How is the prescription made up ? In the same way that a doctor uses to make up a medical prescription:through an examination . Just after entering school each September , the children of Banneker school are examined to see precisely what each of them knows in terms of reading and math . The tests are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every problem is keyed to a particular unit in the learning material used in the school . Every question a student misses points exactly to a learning unit he needs to conquer . Thus the test tells the school not merely what a child knows but , far more importantly , exactly what is appropriate to try to learn next . With this information , the staff and faculty at Banneker design a course for helping him to learn exactly what he needs and usually wants to know next . That course may involve special learning materials ( or programmed learning ) developed by BRL or the Xerox Corporation or Science Research Associates . It may also involve watching film strips or hearing lessons on taped cassettes to heighten and lighten the intellectual thrust of the child . Everything is written out on a sheet of paper in a code as abstruse as a doctor 's prescription : M-16-l-5 was one listed for a nine-year-old girl in math . The children are taught the simple decoding mechanism and they are given the responsibility not only for finding the right room at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the school  --  but for finding the right learning material in that room . The texts are on shelves ; the work-papers in filing cases set at a height that any child can reach ; the games and taped cassettes and earphones are spread around on various tables . The child finds his own chair  --  no rooms in the new Banneker have rows and aisles and batallions of carefully massed chairs , as in the " old " school systems  --  and goes through the learning material a , . fast and as comfortably as he can . " Under this system , " says one staff member , " a child can go slowly without being made to feel he 's a failure . " For he may not be a failure : he may be learning deeply instead of quickly . " We instruct the teachers not to reprimand a child for going slowly . We want to give him the idea that he is a very worthwhile person . " The highly fluid learning situation , and in particular the nongraded structure of the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in class . The reason . every child is working individually on his own " p rescription " and does n't know how well another child in the same reading level might be doing . And since the school authorities  --  the teachers and administrators  --  are careful not to place any shame on a child for being slow , the other children do n't learn from them that they should shame a child who 's slow . For there is only one standard at Banneker : if it finds that a child ca n't do the work , then the school tries to find out where it failed , not where the child failed . This lack of shame  --  this positive sense of worth  --  has transformed some children . One little girl whom we 'll call Audrey had suffered through a series of humiliations in another school in Gary She " failed " second grade , not once but twice , and the natural assumption by the authorities at that school was that it was all Audrey 's fault . As a matter of fact , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality conflict who was intent on humiliating that child at every opportunity , " I was told by an outside observer . In any case , the only thing Audrey learned was to hate school and everything it stood for . She accepted her teacher 's appraisal of herself . When her mother , hoping to get the child Continued on page 132 air , the risk of an explosion would last for about sixty seconds , a much shorter period than with similar quantities of gasoline . The most economical method used now for the commercial production of hydrogen is called steam reforming  --  steam is passed over very hot fossil fuels , to set off a chemical reaction which produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide . This means , of course , that hydrogen can be economically and profitably manufactured by the industries now involved with the production of fossil fuels . Not only could it be produced in sufficient quantities by existing industries , it could even be distributed though the petroleum industry 's existing network of pipelines . However , we can not rely for long on fossil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn the fossil fuels directly in our furnaces and engines or use them to make hydrogen , the same facts of diminishing supply apply . But our technology seems to be moving toward a timely and reasonable solution for this problem . Many of us can remember high school experiments with electrolysis : Two electrodes are placed in a container of water and electrical current is used to break the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen . This same process would work commercially , on a massive scale , if immense quantities of water and large quantities of cheap electrical power are available . The only real prospect for enormous quantities of cheap electrical power in our future lies in the continued and accelerated development of nuclear power plants . Our society already faces a critical shortage of electrical power now and there are not enough rivers to dam nor enough coal to burn to generate the energy we need , The nuclear power plants of the future will generate the electrical power required to electrolyze water  --  probably sea water  --  on a scale vast enough to produce hydrogen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we can expect the petroleum and transportation industries to shut themselves down voluntarily , nor can we expect Congress to put them out of business . Too many of our jobs , too much of our way of life depends upon these industries . Butt think it is entirely reasonable to expect and even insist that these industries do shift to the use of a fuel which is scientifically and technically possible , which does not pollute , and which  --  this is the important point  --  is possible without destroying existing investments . 2 moving on her school work , urged her to read a book or study some math problems , Audry just shrugged and said , " 1 do n't know how . I 'm too dumb to do that . " Her mother was near despair . She could only imagine what disasters would befall the child if Audrey had to spend a third year in second grade , bigger and older than all the rest of the kids and a more conspicuous target than ever for the teacher . But her mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she lived outside of Banneker 's school district , she decided to see if she could get Audrey transferred there . She could not  --  at least by all the traditional rules of education . But Banneker is run by private enterprise , not by the traditional rules of education . So it found a way to put aside all the objections and cut through all the red tape and get Audrey admitted to Banneker last September . The change has not transformed Audrey intellectually . She 's learning about as well as any nine-year-old after a disastrous school experience . But it did change her emotionally . She came to love school and love being there  --  it gave her a sense of self-esteem , as if she really was a loved and loving person . The trouble now is that she wo n't stay home when she should stay home . A few weeks ago she woke up with a fever of 101 ? and her mother said she 'd have to stay in bed . Audrey would have none of it : she was expected in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to school . Her mother solved the problem by bundling Audrey up warmly , driving her over to school , and whisking her in to see the school nurse . The nurse took Audrey 's temperature and looked down her throat and told her gravely , " Now Audrey , the best thing you can do for your studies today is to stay home and rest . Then when your temperature is normal you can come back to school and it 'll seem like more fun than ever . " That was the one thing  --  the only thing ? in the personal prescription of this girl that got her to go home . Much of the success of the school is due not only to the new system but to the teachers , these " curriculum managers , " who 've adapted to the system and often been given special training by BRL . For their responsibilities are higher and more creative than ever before . Each one must see the children as individuals , instead of as a class , and she must treat and inspire each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite creative , " says Mrs. Jones , who is assistant to the learning director , " because what will stimulate one child to grasp his work perfectly simply wo n't work with the child studying next to him . So she has to come up with thirty-five different motivational plans for thirty-five different children . " She must also succeed where the learning materials might fail . There are days on which most children feel  --  like the rest of us  --  a little lazy , a little indifferent , or just not able to cope . Those are the days w hen he goes through the programmed learning in the easiest way possible . But in the Banneker system , the lesson is self-executing : after he 's taken the shortcut through all the learning material , he suddenly comes across a test to which there are no ready answers . That reveals him to himself . If he 's been cheating on himself , he 's likely to do poorly on the test  --  and suddenly not know quite what to do next . That 's when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get him started again on the material he fudged his way through , or motivate him to go willingly through another set of learning material on exactly the same learning level . For the idea at Banneker is not to let a poor score on a test defeat a child or halt his learning process . " Our whole effort is to motivate child to succeed within himself , " says Brian Fitch . It may be that the child alone simply could n't understand the material he was working on and needs the help of a teacher . That 's why the curriculum manager is there : to tutor the child in what he does n't understand , to motivate him in doing what he must understand . and to guide him in finding the path to understanding . In all of this , the child is learning something that is n't in the school books : that he does n't have to be defeated or frustrated by one poor performance in school or in life ; that if he 's honest with himself , he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that if he looks around , there 's usually somebody standing there , ready to help . At Banneker , the teacher , or curriculum manager , must also possess a certain sensitivity to success . For it sometimes appears in such dramatic dimensions that she is hard put to believe it and to find the next challenge for the child . ' Fake Kevin Jones : when he came to Banneker as a sixth-grader last September , he could not read , even on the first-grade level . It was another common case of the inner-city child : he 'd simply been passed along from one grade to the next even though he had n't mastered the simplest things in school . So Banneker started hint on the primary reading level and his " curriculum managers " kept an eye out to see how he was progressing . It turned out that he was progressing so fast as to raise a belief that he was experiencing a " quantum jump " in intellectual ability  --  that suddenly , somehow , it all had come together  --  in reading  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a decent chance to move up a grade in June , and another grade the next June and so on and on . But at Banneker , his curriculum manager noticed that he was passing all the other children on his learning level , " that somehow his understanding had come all at once , " says Mrs. Jones . He was given a test to see if he could move up roughly one year-level in his studies . He passed it . He was given a test on the next-year-up . He passed it . He was given yet another test to see if he could move a year beyond that . He passed it . Before the tests finished , Kevin had shown that he had jumped the equivalent of four grades and was now reading as well as the average boy his age . The staff at Banneker does n't know quite why : they reviewed all his test results from the very start and are persuaded that they were " true " ? that the staff did n't get a misreading . It is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traumatic experience in the past  --  that he could read but feared to do anything that let it be known . And that only the learning environment of Banneker school released the inhibition . Or it may simply be that he " came of age " intellectually and was able to put it all together suddenly . But in any case , it seems apparent that Banneker school gave him the chance to break out of a non-performance  --  or " failure " ? role and into one in which he could perform and achieve his full measure of satisfaction successfully . There was a lesson in all this for the Banneker school : that a child 's sense of success , and of self-esteem , needs to be shared . Under Shermen Newell , the Banneker school embarked on a program of sharing it specifically with the parents of the children in the school . That an exceptional effort had to be made is evident in the experience of most inner-city parents : the only thing they get from school is bad news  --  that their child has failed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shermen Newell and his staff decided against calling parents about the problems that a child encounters in school ; he felt it was something that the school should be able to handle . But he decided that the school should make a point of it to call whenever a child has had a success at Banneker . So every day after school , Mrs. Jones , as Newell 's assistant , sits down at the phone and calls the parents of the ten or twenty students who 've been moved up from one level to another . " After the child has left for the day , " she says , " so he 'll be home when his mother gets the news . " The idea is to share the pride of success with the parent so that parent and child can know together that school is a place of enduring success . In all of this , the tests and the standards governing the performance contract apply to reading and math , but the curriculum at Banneker and the sense of success among the children are not confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , the social studies , and " enrichment : " drama , art , music , and the use of such resources as the library . The techniques used in these courses vary from course to course and age group to age group . Some children are able to understand more about aspects of health and the body than others , but this does tend to be a function of age , not of the mind . And so Banneker is more inclined to separate the children by age , or maturity , in these pursuits than in others . It is also more likely to let them learn in small groups or large : dramatic and choral work simply demand that children work together in groups of a size that makes the study viable . But the ultimate measure that people point to is reading and math . How well does Ban neker do ? The results of the first year are in . They were gathered through performance tests at the end of the first school year as compared with performance tests at the beginning of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center for Urban Redevelopment in Education ( CURE ) , an independent organization not connected with BR L or with the Gary school system . CURE compared the tests  --  developed by a national testing body  --  made on the Banneker children to see whether they had advanced in reading and math skills and how much . The evaluations were later confirmed , for payment reasons , by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse &; Co . These were the results : ? Some 546 children who would normally have been in grades two through six were tested . ( The first-graders were not tested in this group because they had no reading or math exposure at the start of their first-grade year . ) Of those 546 children , 72.5 percent made average or betterthan-average gains in reading , mathematics or both . Moreover , 32 percent of them  --  almost one-third  --  made gains of I V2. years or more .  - -  Some eighty children in kindergarten were tested on their " readiness , " which indicated how well suited they 'd be for future educational thrusts . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norms on this test . ( On a national average , only 69 percent of the children tested ever reach the norm . ) ? Some ninety-one students in first grade were tested on their reading skills . Most of them started not with first-grade reading skills but with considerably less than that . On the average , they wound up with an average reading skill of 1.7 grades . That suggested they 'd still be behind the national average when they started second grade ; it was a reflection , perhaps , of the long time needed to prepare these students for the most primary demands in learning to read . ? Some eighteen students who entered Banneker above-average finished their first year at Banneker I ' h years farther above average . These eighteen students showed that they were just below a seventh-grade level at the start of the school year ( though Banneker accepted no children of an age or experience above the sixth grade level . ) At the end of the year , they tested out as equal to young people halfway through their freshman year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a survey was made of the parents ' attitude to-wards what was happening in Ban-Continued on page 134 neker school . The results : 87 percent felt t hat the Banneker program should be continued ; 84 percent thought their children had made greater improvement in this year than their last in math , and 79 percent saw the same kind of improvement in reading . In addition , 7I percent of the parents noted that their children read more at home and 79 percent suggested that their children talked more about school . Seventy-eight percent indicated that their children clearly liked school more . How did this measure up to the money-back guarantee ? BRL said that it would run the school as economically as any other school in the Gary system-and that it would expect to be paid on the basis of what the school costs were . The average cost of educating a student at Banneker in this first school year ran to just over $830 . The cost for the entire school system was an average of $924 . That means that the Banneker school was run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rest of the system , or roughly 10 percent less than the rest of the system . " If we turned the school back to Gary right now , " said Dr. Fitch last December , " I think we could show them how they could save as much as 15 percent on its operations . " This , as it happens , is the ultimate goal : BRL is working on a three-year contract at Banneker school and its aim is to turn the school back to the city of Gary with all systems intact . It is not ambitious to take over more and more schools in Gary or anyplace else ; it wants merely to demonstrate that there are more effective ways of teaching than the present public-school syndrome permits . Beyond all this , the figures on the contract are clear : in the first year of operation , BRL was paid $662,982.08 . This was $74,689,12 less than it would have been paid if every student gained in reading and math as fast as he could have gained . BRL had , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to bring even more students up to a national reading level , most particularly those in the highest-sixth grade . In those two years , BRL is hoping to find how best to improve the system so that not only the concept of failure is gone but so also is the stigma of an " F " record where an " S " should have been . For the grades in the school are not defeating , but explicit : either the child at Banneker meets the criteria of 100 percent-for " satisfactory " - or the school finds out why . Within itself . M driver whose wife had earlier reported to the police that he had been drunk for three days and that they should pick him up before he hurt himself or someone else , " wrote a woman doctor in the Far West . " Their reply to her was that they could n't pick him up until he had done something besides being drunk . And so he did ! " What he did , the letter goes on to sadly recount , was crash head-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and her husband . The drunk driver was taken to the hospital and placed under police guard so that he would not escape . " How much better it would have been to guard him before he got into his car , " wrote the doctor . " Something is certainly wrong with our laws affecting drunk drivers ... ! ' ' Some of the biggest tragedies involve those who were able to save themselves from drinking , only to later die at the hands of another drunk driver . The story of a man we shall call Gordon Mallory is an example . A once-successful businessman with a happy family , Gordon began drinking so heavily that eventually his company went to ruin , his family to despair , his neighbors to contempt . After a time Gordon wound up on skid row where time became a torment squeezed between days of desperate destiny . In one of those moments of revelation , he staggered into an experience that aroused an old knowledge and a dormant hope . He was led to Alcoholics Anonymous and a new life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and decided to rebuild . He went to another town , got his family to join him , and did n't take a drink for five years . One night while on his way home from an AA meeting , he was blinded by the lights of another car coming at him head-on . He wrenched the wheel reflexively to get out of the way . It was all he knew before he knew nothing . The next morning , all his friends , old and new , read of his death . Some of his aid ones wondered if he had been drinking . All of his new ones knew he had not . But soon they all came to know the last and most terrible irony of Gordon Mallory 's life and death : the driver of the car that killed him was an alcoholic who was driving in a drunken stupor . The disturbing depth of such tragedies reflects the scope and amplitude of their cause . There are an estimated nine million alcoholics in the United States today . Some seven million of them are driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' drunk ' might be considered ' sick , ' says Benjamin 0 . Davis , assistant secretary of the Department of Transportation , " the minute he gets behind the wheel of a car , he becomes a different person . He becomes a criminal . " What can be done to curb that criminal ? " Confiscate the car ! " wrote a man in Cleveland , Ohio . " Take away his car until he 's stopped drinking , " urged a reader in Galesburg , Illinois . " A potential murderer is little more than a wild animal , " wrote a man in Union City , Tennessee . " Should n't his claws be removed ? " This was the feeling of the vast majority of readers who responded to the poll accompanying " The Killer Drunk " in The Saturday Evening Post . Some 94 percent of them checked " yes " under the question : " Is confiscation of the automobile an appropriate penalty for the drunk driver who repeatedly drives with blood-alcohol levels far beyond the legal limit ? " The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state legislature is being exposed to a proposal that would establish a Memorial Day Moratorium on death-bydrunk . The proposal provides not only for screening out of drunk drivers on that holiday weekend but insists on the immediate impoundment  --  and ultimate confiscation-of the car of anybody found to be driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of .15 percent or higher . If that proves successful in reducing the drunk-driver toll , the idea might he extended to all other holidays during the year . " We might even suggest using the money from the confiscated automobiles to rehabilitate alcoholics , " says one supporter of the idea . The federal government is moving slowly in the same direction . The U.S. Department of Transportation has quietly drafted recommendations that laws be passed that would include-among other things-impoundment or confiscation of cars driven by drunk drivers . Impoundment would come on the second offense ; that means the authorities would keep the car in custody for a certain length of time-say a year-before returning it to its owner . Confiscation would come on the third offense ; that means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income from the sale would he used for the public treasury . ( The Department of Transportation is also suggesting that the income be used for the rehabilitation of alcoholics . Up until recently , the federal government 's investment in the treatment of alcoholism has been an estimated $4 million a year , compared to the estimated $8.2 billion a year that all levels of government-local , state and federal-receive in taxes from the sale of alcoholic beverages . ) What if the drunk borrowed or rented the car ? The DOT proposal takes that into account . It urges that the car be impounded or confiscated even if it 's owned by somebody other than the
