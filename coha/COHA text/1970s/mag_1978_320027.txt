In this era of sexual emancipation are parents as uptight as of yore in discussing sex with their kids ? Yes , indeed . That at least was the word last week from a Kinsey-type study called Family Life and Sexual Learning , prepared by the Project on Human Sexual Development . The researchers spent three years probing the attitudes of 1,400 mostly young Cleveland parents and concluded that they are as reticent in talking about sex as their parents were . The report 's highlights : <P> &gt;Some 85% to 95% of parents say they have never mentioned any aspect of erotic behavior or its consequences to their offspring . <P> &gt;Parents who do talk about sex with their children think that one chat is enough . <P> &gt; Parents worry about masturbation , especially fathers because they fear that it will lead their sons to homosexuality . <P> &gt; Blacks have almost exactly the same views on sex education as whites , except that they are more likely to bring the subject up with their youngsters . <P> &gt; Both mothers and fathers are about twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters . <P> Conclude the researchers : " In word and action , the Cleveland parents generally seem to be repeating a pattern set before them by their parents that includes little , if any , verbal communication about sexuality . " Emancipation or not , it 's apparently the same old birds and bees .
