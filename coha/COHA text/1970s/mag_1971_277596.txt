Spurred on by World War II , then the cold war , then Sputnik , U.S. science rose to an unprecedented level of prestige in the 1960s . Yet even as it is gaining its greatest triumphs-the moon , the green revolution , the ability to control and even change the processes of life-science and scientists have come under increasing attack . Some more reasonable critics argue that the antiscience barrage promises more good than harm for a field that has been enjoying too high a priority for too long . Science Writer Lawrence Lessing , a member of FORTUNE 'S board of editors , does not agree . In the magazine 's March issue , he argues that if the current " senseless war " on science and its kindred discipline , technology , continues much longer , the U.S. will be a considerably worse place in which to live . <P> Seamless Web . Lessing acknowledges that the " apocalyptic mood has been stirred by some very palpable social miscarriages of science and technology " - notably the Indochina war and the environmental crisis . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less growth , less knowledge , less skill , less progress . " Scientists and engineers , he says , " are increasingly cast as the villains of this emotional drama . But it should be obvious that science by its nature and structure can offer society only options . " Lessing points out that the traditional role of scientists is advisory , and as often as not their advice is ignored . " The height of the new folly , " he says , " is the rising call upon scientists and technicians to foresee all the consequences of their actions and to make a moral commitment to suppress work on any discovery that might some day be dangerous , which is to demand that they be not only scientists but certified clairvoyants and saints . " <P> There is also danger in the notion that society can choose what it wants of science and destroy what it feels is valueless or threatening . " Science is indivisible , " Lessing states , " a seamless web of accumulated knowledge , and to destroy a part would rip the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dual aspect " -a potential for both benefit and harm . He warns that it does no good to try to retreat to an earlier century , and he quotes Konrad Lorenz , the famed naturalist and animal behaviorist , who has been warning hostile student audiences that if they tear down knowledge to start afresh , they will backslide 200,000 years . " Watch out ! " Lorenz cautions the students . " If you make a clean sweep of things , you wo n't go back to the Stone Age , because you 're already there , but to well before the Stone Age .
