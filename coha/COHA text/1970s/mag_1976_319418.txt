For Norman Siegel , a stocky , 40-year-old English teacher from Bridgeport , Conn. , drowsiness had been a curse since high school days . He could fall asleep and indeed often did , at almost any time-in front of his class , at the wheel of his car and even while giving driver-training instruction . For years , despite spending thousands of dollars looking for a cure and being twitted by his friends about his intermittent stupors , he was unable to do anything about his affliction . <P> Siegel was one of the 50,000 or more Americans who suffer from a little-known , and often misdiagnosed disorder called sleep apnea ( literally , want of breath ) . During a single night , they may wake up 400 or 500 times . These interruptions are so brief , only a few seconds or so , that apnea victims are usually totally unaware of them and at a loss to explain the morning-after blahs . When these patients take their complaint to a doctor , they usually get no help . The problem is that the physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing the underlying cause of the malaise . Often the most he can do is to prescribe some sleeping pills , which generally prove totally ineffectual and can be dangerous . Now , as a result of the emergence of a whole new specialty that deals only with sleep disorders , the ailments that tortured Siegel and hundreds of other patients are finally being properly diagnosed and brought under control . <P> First , the sleep clinicians probe deeply into a patient 's sleep habits-for example , by questioning his bed partner . They also video-tape his slumber behavior in special sleeping rooms , where patients spend the night hooked up to a polygraph , a lie-detector-like machine that monitors sleep-related physiological functions ( breathing , muscle twitching , rapid eye movement* ) . <P> After Siegel had spent only a single night at the new sleep-wake clinic of New York 's Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center , Neurologist Elliot Weitzman 's suspicions about him were confirmed ; as soon as Siegel fell asleep , the functioning of the muscles of his upper respiratory tract became so impaired that breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute ( doctors are uncertain whether excessive muscle relaxation or contraction is responsible ) . Then Siegel would awake with a start , and in his groggy state would gasp for air with a loud snore . The loud gasping and snoring were repeated hundreds of times during the night , seriously disturbing his sleep . <P> Sudden Death . The primary cause of this breathing failure remains unclear , though sometimes it appears to be linked with obesity . In any case , drowsiness is only the mildest byproduct . The disorder can lead to hypoxia ( low blood oxygen ) , hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , heart disease and in some cases sudden death . Nor is it easily treatable . Conventional sleeping pills can actually worsen the problem by increasing the breathing difficulty . Removing the tonsils and adenoids to make a larger breathing passage seems to work only in children . Shedding weight makes little difference . Jokes the still overweight Siegel : " I 've lost 3,000 pounds over the years . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
