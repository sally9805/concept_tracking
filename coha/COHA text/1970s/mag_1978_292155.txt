Faces kickback charges <P> Ever since flamboyant Congressman Adam Clayton Powell lost his House seat in 1970 , roly-poly Charles Coles Diggs Jr .. 55 , has been the senior black member of Congress . The son of a powerful Michigan politician who became wealthy as an undertaker in Detroit , Diggs has won election to the House twelve times from the city 's predominantly poor and black 13th Congressional District . Because of his seniority , he became the first chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971 . He is also chairman of the House District of Columbia Committee and the House International Relations Subcommittee on Africa . <P> Last week a federal grand jury handed down a 35-count indictment charging Diggs with padding his federal payroll by $101,000 since 1973 . He was accused of inflating the wages of three House employees-one aide 's pay , for instance , jumped from $14,667.84 to $37,355 a year-and then requiring them to pay some of his personal bills with the raises . In addition , he was charged with putting three employees of the family undertaking business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $35,000 . <P> According to investigators , Diggs has been burdened for years with heavy personal and business debts . In addition , the Internal Revenue Service has filed tax claims of $5,000 against Diggs himself , and $48,000 against the estate of his father , who died in 1967 . <P> From Mozambique , where he was on a 15-day junket , Diggs last week professed his innocence . But months before leaving the country he used some $8,000 raised by his friends to hire a lawyer from the firm headed by famed Defense Attorney Edward Bennett Williams . If convicted , Diggs faces up to five years in jail on each count , and fines totaling $224,000.
