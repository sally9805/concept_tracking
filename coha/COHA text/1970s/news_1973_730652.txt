txt When Mrs. Josephine Paxhia brought her home on Edgemere Drive along the shore of Lake Ontario three years ago , the water in front of her house was ankle deep . Today the water is well above waist-level , and billowy gusts of near-freezing spray smash against the house while massive windswept waves pummel her break wall , now in danger of collapse . At one point last year , Mrs. Paxhia , a licensed real estate broker , found a fish wedged between two windows in her dining room . Meanwhile , next door , Merrit Hutchison , in his spick-and-span , modernized kitchen , remembers 75 feet of beach front on his property when he was a boy . Now ? high waves relentlessly splash away at the small strip of land left between his front living room and the lake . A retired businessman , he has all his savings in the home . The situation along Edgemere Drive in Greece , New York , a suburb of Rochester , can be tragically repeated in many places along the lake 's shore line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester area , for example , hundreds of beach-front homes are in danger of being literally washed away . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ? " far too late , " grumble many residents  --  is in a race with the clock to erect temporary sand and earthen fills to hold back the rising waters , fed by unusually heavy snow and rain , and spill-off down to Lake Ontario from the other Great Lakes . Until now at least , the corps has thrown up no diking in the suburban area of Greece . The lake 's waters are expected to rise at least another two feet by May or June . The big questions here : How to quickly avert the disaster here ? And , equally important , how could such a perplexing dilemma have come about in the first place ? Is what 's happening , as some ask , actually a man-made disaster triggered by irresponsible policies of United States and Canadian officials who oversee the lake ? Moreover , say some local officials , what is happening here is a grim case study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and private citizens must slice through when disasters strike . // *Lake Ontario creeps toward homes // This reporter flew to Rochester and suburban Greece for a firsthand look at the Lake Ontario shoreline after Mr. Paxhia 's middle-aged son Peter finally felt he had " had it " with government red tape and one evening put through a call to the Monitor as a last resort . Waiting for miracle " Everyone was just sitting around waiting for a miracle , yet the waters kept getting higher and higher . We just do n't have much time , " says Mr. Paxhia , who slogs his way through the snow to a sliver of land with several trees on it to the right side of his house . Waves from a small inlet ? a beach several years ago ? slam away at the bank . Crossing to the left side of the house , Mr. Paxhia points to ice caked along the wall . Clumps of seaweed are splashed starkly against the second floor level . Seveial houses away , jagged slivers of freezing water rip away chunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no break wall . Says William Zoeller , an engineer with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , " Time is a critical factor . Unfortunately in most cases we 're behind schedule . " Particularly bad situation Engineers for the local district of the Army corps can see the situation here is particularly bad . Water levels are expected to soar to some 248.3 feet by spring , some 2 feet above the current 246.4 . The previous flood level high ? some 248.0 feet back in 1952 ? caused $7.3 million dollars of damage just along the New York side of the lake . Roughly $3.3 million of that loss was tallied in the Rochester area . Looking ahead , some engineers believe that unless the lake waters fall back to a more normal level of 243 or 244 feet during the next several years , thousands of homes could be endangered or damaged along the shoreline . It is believed it will take at least several years to get the lake back to the more average levels . Result of policy ? Don Riely , Greece town supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents along the shoreline , believes the increasingly high water levels here are in part the result of policies of " big business " interests ? particularly power companies and shipping firms who can be expected to benefit from higher water levels . Both groups deny these charges , as do engineers for the Army corps , who argue that unusual precipitation along the Great Lakes throughout 1972 and 1973 ( including rainfall from hurricane Agnes last year ) boosted water levels . Lake Erie , spilling into Lake Ontario , is itself high . At present only two of the Great Lakes , Ontario and Superior , have the control systems necessary to regulate their outflow . Outflow regulated The outflow of Lake Ontario , regulated by the corps and U.S.-Canadian joint control commission , can be as much as 310,000 cubic feet of water per second under perfect conditions , without imparing communities along the St. Lawrence River . By the end of the year , according to officials of the Detroit-based Lake Survey Center , drainage went from 239,000 cubic feet per second to 293,000 , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level during the navigation season , between spring and late December , has been held by the control commission at between 242.7 feet and 246.7 feet above sea level , but many residents here , such as Mrs. Paxhia , believe faster outflow is the only long-term solution . " I do n't want a pacifier ( such as a breakwall ) , " she says . " I want that lake lowered . " Land now gone " Regardless of the legal definition , at one point there was land out there . They tell us ' if the house is in danger , move it back . ' But if all the land that belongs to us is under water , where can we take the house ? " asks another resident . " What happened to all our lakefront land ? " he asks . Many residents and some town officials in the Rochester area say they have been appalled at the maze of red tape they have run into . The state by law can not get into ' flood control work . Current federal statues do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than temporary sandbag or earthen dikes , if the towns give rights of way , and provide building materials . If a temporary structure goes up , then the town must maintain the structure for at least one year before removing it or making it permanent . The Corps regulations , originally developed for river , not lake , flooding , preclude the corps from fighting beach erosion . Letter sent first Greece town supervisor Riley first sent a letter off to the Army corps early this year . By late January he still had received no reply , so he finally insisted on going to see the corps officials first hand . Disgruntled at all that 's happened , he is now meeting with federal officials in Washington , hoping , among other things , to have the lake lowered . Many townspeople here , though , note that the red tape mix-ups are much deeper . Though the initial planning for " operation foresight " ? the corps 's flood prevention plan began around Thanksgiving of last year , when local corps officials were told to send a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local corps officers headquartered in Buffalo did n't receive a go-ahead until late December . By the new year , local communities had been contacted by the corps and had accepted the corps plan . But then another precondition for federal help , a request from the state , was n't met until late January when Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller met with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation . By late January , however , the waters were already swirling 15 inches above their usual average . Meantime , the clock ticks away as the spring flood " deadline " approaches . For individual citizens like the Paxhias or Mr. Hutchinson and his wife , the issue is starker than just cataloging the hardships of fighting government bureaucracy : It 's saving their homes .
