Sure losers . That is what the Golden State Warriors appeared to be when they reported to training camp last fall . In a preseason shakeup , the Warrior front office had traded Center Nate Thurmond to Chicago , sent Rebounder Clyde Lee to Atlanta , and lost Cazzie Russell to Los Angeles after the streak-shooting forward had played out his option . The team 's only returning star was Rick Barry , basketball 's soldier of fortune who had played for three teams in two leagues in the past nine years . <P> Now , halfway through the season , the Warriors have a commanding lead in their division and the second-best record in the league and are play-off-bound . The main reason is Barry , who at 30 has emerged as the best forward in the N.B.A. As of last week , Barry was the leading scorer in the league ( 33.9 points a game ) , the second-best free-throw shooter ( a .920 percentage ) and the No. 2 ball thief ( 2.65 steals average ) . Barry was also among the top five playmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards . <P> " I 'm a perfectionist , " says Barry , " I ca n't stand mediocrity . " If being a one-man offense is perfection , Barry is indeed close to the mark . Tall enough ( 6 ft. 7 in. ) and heavy enough ( 220 Ibs. ) to hold his own against most rival forwards , Barry can torment opponents with a deadly outside jump shot or exceptionally quick moves to the basket . Already this season , he has scored more than 40 points in ten games . " I do n't believe any one man can prevent me from scoring , " he says . Because he has been so hot , he often draws double coverage , and that leaves teammates open for Barry 's artful feeds . <P> Barry does not limit his work to scoring . On defense he is surprisingly tenacious ; with a combination of anticipation and quick hands , he consistently disrupts opposition plays . <P> This year , for the first time , Barry is also captain of the Warriors , a job that he takes seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attles . " He pursued it , and once he won it , has worked hard making suggestions to younger players and serving as an example . " <P> So far , the Attles-Barry leadership has paid off . The Warriors ' new center , Clifford Ray , acquired in the deal for Thurmond , has been an outstanding defensive player and rebounder . Barry 's teammate at forward is Rookie Keith ( " Silk " ) Wilkes , a U.C.L.A. product who has retained all of his smooth college shooting skills . At the guard spots , Golden State has two solid ball handdlers and playmakers in Butch Beard and Charles Johnson . <P> Barry has worked for a long time to become the game 's premier forward . He took to the basketball court at age five to play against his older brother Dennis when the Barrys lived in Roselle Park , N.J. <P> " I played all day every day in the summer , " Rick recalls . " In the winter , I 'd shovel snow off the court and even play at night . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he led the nation in scoring his senior year .
