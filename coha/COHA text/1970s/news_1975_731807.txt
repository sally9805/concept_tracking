The move to more morning darkness and extra daylight at day 's end takes place two months ahead of the schedule that has prevailed in the U.S. for most of the last decade . It would take special legislation to make this current pattern of eight months of daylight saving and four months of standard time in the winter ( instead of the usual 6:6 ratio ) the national norm .
