As the much-traveled chairman of a worldwide consulting firm , David Nicolson was so often exasperated by delays on British Overseas Airways Corp . and British European Airways that " there were many times when I told my secretary never again to book me on BOAC or BEA . " Maybe it takes a disgruntled customer to straighten out a business . The Conservative government tapped Nicolson to take command of both state-run airlines , and as he begins his third year on the job , his enterprise provides a conspicuous bright spot in Britain 's gloomy economy . <P> Nicolson was commissioned not only to end the two lines ' steep financial dive , but also to merge them into one carrier , British Airways . A newcomer to airlines , he was at first greeted with distrust . Workers , fearing mass layoffs after the merger , even threatened not to paint new insignia on the planes . So Nicolson , 51 , came in like a lamb . He set up no fewer than 20 worker-management committees to determine everything from the merged line 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining separate operations-like the carriers ' computer systems ( $5,000,000 annual savings ) - he cut costs without laying off any of the 58,000 employees . <P> After a net loss of $800,000 in fiscal 1972 , British Airways posted a $12 million net profit on revenues of $1.2 billion for fiscal 1973 . Labor productivity has risen 21% in the past 16 months . This calendar year the line is the leader in passenger growth on the North Atlantic ; its traffic is up 17% on that run , 50% on the fast-growing Far East run , and 15% systemwide . And quiescent workers recently finished painting BRITISH AIRWAYS on the company 's 220 planes , which now constitute the world 's largest commercial fleet .
