txt Cow but on the other hand some cows do n't mind it at all : I have a neighbour who milks with the calf sucking away on one side and himself squatting down milking on the other . Our cow is now having her fore-teats milked by the calf and her hind by us , and it is working perfectly . Another way is to let the calf suck , say , once a day and you milk at the other end of the day . Again , you may possibly have psychological troubles with the cow , on the other hand possibly no trouble at all . Probably to remove the calf altogether after a week is the best method . After a day or two of unsettlement the cow then settles down to the regime of being milked very nicely , and you get all the milk . Then what to do with the calf . Well , you have got to feed the calf either on milk , reconstituted milk powder , or milk substitute for at least three months , and he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets a little older , perhaps a gallon a day to start with . Offer very very good hay to the calf when he is old enough to want it , and try him with a little concentrates , either ground corn or calf cake bought from the mill . The moment you take the calf away from the cow your are going against nature , and you may have to pay the consequences . The calf may get ill . He will probably show this by scouring ? that is having diarrhoea . If he has nasty smelly white droppings or blood in his droppings , send for the vet and no messing . If he just has pretty stinky diarrhoea , smelling like babies , take him off milk immediately , make him drink warm water , or warm water with a little glucose in it , and keep him warm and dry . Shove some antibiotics into him too : there are several pills and tablets you can get from the chemists . If you do n't , he will probably die . He will live without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , but use common sense , and when he seems to be better let him have a little milk diluted with water , then a little milk . Calves should be kept out of draughts , but with fresh air passing above them , on clean bedding , be gently and kindly 50 COW treated , and the apparatus you use to feed them should be clean and sterilised . The milk you give them should be bodytemperature and fresh . A calf just let to suck naturally from his mother will almost never go wrong , particularly if left out of doors . Cows calve high in the mountains in the bitterest winter and lose hardly any calves . A calf taken from his mother and fed from a bucket is very likely to go wrong . The calves that you see at every cattle mart , or market , being thrown out of the backs of vans and lorries , dragged about by their tails , flung into dirty and contaminated pens where they stand in mess and draught for hours on end with other frightened little animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's old banger , driven back to a farm , dragged into a stuffy shed : these calves are fighting for their lives and often do n't bother to fight very hard . I have a neighbour who buys calves thus , perforce for he has to rear beef for a living , and I asked him how he got his replacements . Buy them in the mart on Monday ' , he said , put them on antibiotics on Wednesday , and bury them on Friday . ' We 've done the same , although Sally is an absolute genius at nursing little things back to health . But it is a fight , and the whole system of selling little week-old calves in the open market should go the way of the slave-trade ? out . It is monstrously cruel and extremely inefficient . There is a law that these calves should have a week of their mother 's milk before they are sold . Without the protection of the colostrum ? the medicinal first-milk of their own dam ? they are doomed anyway . But many milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody know if they have ? Dairy farmers want rid of their calves ? quick . They do n't want them . This is why they are taken to the mart , to be sold to specialists , or smallholders ' wives who like to rear a calf or two , and brought up on the bucket . There should be agencies set up all over the country , working by telephone , to put such dairy farmers in touch with calf-rearers ? on the same principle as agencies to supply au pair girls . The buyer could then go and get the calf straight from the farm where it was born , make sure that it had been 5 1 COW properly treated , cary it carefully to a nice warm car , drive it quickly home , and then nurse it . You see , many of the buyers want to get the calf to put on a cow of their own who has just calved , on the principle known as multiple suckling , which we shall deal with in a moment . Such buyers need a calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has calved . If they introduce the calf to her foster mother immediately after the latter has calved she is far more likely to take to him . To teach a calf to suck from a bucket we have a thing called a little mother ' , which is a stainless steel or aluminium bucket which hangs on the wall and has rubber teats hanging down from it . When the calf is very young they must be scrupulously cleaned . The more usual method is to teach the calf to drink straight out of a bucket . You do this by grabbing the calf 's nose , poking two fingers in his mouth so that he starts to suck , and forcing his nose into the milk . After a time he discovers that thus he can suck milk besides your fingers . It may be a struggle at first , and women have got much more patience with small animals than men , not unnaturally . The great advantage of little mothers ' is that they satisfy a calf 's desire to suck . If a calf sucks his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other calves . If he gollops his milk up from a bucket he will have an insatiable desire to suck ? anythingthe navel of another calf ( which can lead to disease ) , an old dirty rope-end , baling twine , or the poisonous lead paint off the gate of his stall . When the calf is weaned you can either put him out onto good clean grass , if it be summer time , but go on feeding him some concentrates for several weeks , or else keep him on indoors ( you must in the winter time , and probably should if it 's his first summer ) and feed him on roots , good meadow hay , and perhaps four pounds of concentrates a day : more the older he gets . The reason why one is worried about letting him out to grass is because of husk ( or hoose ) . In many parts of the country the grass is infested with the lung worms of cattle , and these , if ingested by a young calf , give him the disease of husk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eventually dies . Why do n't calves running out with their mothers get husk ? Well they do , but they acquire such immunity from their mothers that it does them little harm . Whatever happens , if you are ever going to let your calf out of doors to mix with older cattle , he is going to get husk . The trick is to let him pick it up slowly , when he is older , in good condition , and well fed . He will then get an immunity to it before it gets him down . If you have really clean pasture , that is pasture on which no older cattle have grazed at least since it was last ploughed up and re-seeded , put him on that . We tether calves in our orchard , there is no husk there . Ca n't be ? no big cattle ever go there . If you turn callow young animals straight out into husk-infested pasture you are heading for very big trouble . You will have to get the vet , get the animals injected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well fed , for another year . I know I 've had it . While on the subject of calves , there are three other ways of rearing up calves , and any of them might be useful for the self-supporter as a source of money income . After all , the rest of the world has to eat too . The first is single-suckling . You simply let a herd of cows out onto grass , or rough pasture , with a bull at the right time of the year . The bull , and the cows , will do the rest . Take the calves of the cows at six months of age and sell them in the nearest suckled-calf sales ' . The second is outdoor multiple suckling . This is very applicable to the smallholder . Your cow has a calf . You do n't want to milk her . Rush to a neighbour and buy another newborn calf , put him on your cow with your calf . Keep watch on them both for a few days , indoors , to make sure that she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then turn them out and , after a little more vigilance , forget them . She will rear two fine calves for you , instead of one . This is a very profitable performance . The third method is multiple suckling indoors . It is one way of cheaply building up a herd , but it requires the patience of 53 Cow Job . When your cow has calved go and buy two or three newborn calves . Keep them indoors , bring your cow in twice a day , tie her up , and make her allow the four little calves to suck ( her own and the three others ) . She will kick . She will butt . But she ca n't kick if you hold her tail up tight in the air and if you put a rope tightly around her belly and loins , to pass just in front of her udder . Maybe she 'll get tired of it all before you will . After three months of this , wean those four calves and put , say , three fresh ones on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . After three months wean those and put one on her . Then dry the poor old thing off and give her a rest before she calves again . Ai n't it a beggar , said the Queen of Spain . We 've done it once but we 'll never do it again . As to the small matter of actually milking your cow ? you do it like this . Pinch the top of a teat between thumb and forefinger so that the milk can not escape from the teat back up into the udder . Then squeeze in a downwards direction with the rest of the hand . 54 5 Dairy lithe butter do taste a little of the Swedish turnip , it will do very well where there is plenty of that sweet sauce which early rising and bodily labour are ever sure to bring . WILLIAM COBBETT : Cottage Economy MILK Milk is one of the most complex organic substances that one could possibly imagine , and the extraordinary things that it will do , and that can be done with it , are legion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making knitting needles and spectacle frames out of it . If you leave fresh milk alone in the summer time it curdles . This is because the lactic acid bacteria ( Streptococcus lacticus ) feed upon the lactose which is one of the constituents of milk ( its sugar in fact ) and change the lactose sugar into lactic acid . As the mil becomes more acid the isoelectric point is reached and at is point the particles of the milk no longer repel each other , but come together into what we call curd . Milk curdles best in warm weather or in warm climates ( at about 77 ? F. or 250C . ) . We consume a great deal of naturally curdled milk : it is acid in taste , but mildly acid and very good and digestible . In South Africa it is called dik melk and is a major article of diet . The South Africans have a refinement of dik melk which they call calabash . It is made in this way : milk is put inside a hollowed-out calabash and allowed to curdle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the calabash and some more fresh milk put in . Before it is taken out the calabash is shaken like a cocktail shaker . As the weeks go by the taste of the stuff that comes out of the calabash gets stronger and stronger until it is simply delicious . You must never // starve ' it , or it will turn bad : every day some must be taken out and some put in . I have drunk from a calabash which had been kept going thus for six years , and I kept one going myself for a year . I know somebody who does it in Wales , but in a bottle . You can cause milk to clot immediately , that is form curds , by adding rennet . Rennet is stuff that is taken from a calve 's fourth stomach ( see Chapter 9 ) . Presumably you could obtain it yourself if you killed a young calf , but we buy it in splendid little stoneware bottles from R. J. Fullwood and Bland , 25 Bevenden Street , London N.1 . Milk contains all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty fatty acids have so far been identified in milk , which gives an inkling of its enormous complexity . Lest it be thought that drinking or eating all these fatty acids will lead to coronary thrombosis , let us remember the Borana of Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia , and the Turkana their sworn enemies , who live on nothing else but milk except for an occasional gorge on meat when they ritually slaughter an animal . No Borana has ever been known to have coronary thrombosis . I knew these people very well and they were very healthy . The only element that milk is short of , from a dietetic point of view , is iron . If you keep milk at a higher temperature than 77 ? F. ( 250C. ) , say at 950F. ( 350C. ) , and inoculate it with the right bacteria ( Bacillus bulgaricus ) , you will get not dik melk but yoghourt . Bulgaricus likes more warmth than S. lacticus and can tolerate much higher acidity . The way to make yoghourt is to boil your milk ( to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , inoculate it with live yoghourt , and keep it at that temperature . It will keep quite well owing to its acidity . Pasteurizing is done to all commercial milk nowadays : it kills T.B . and brucellosis bacteria and makes the milk keep a long time . It can only be done with special equipment , and the self-supporter will never wish to do it : his cows have n't got brucellosis or T.B . and he does n't want his milk to keep for long periods . In any case , pasteurized milk is only fit for // townspeople , who have got to the state when they do n't know anything better . To pasteurize milk by the Holder Method keep it at from 145 ? F. ( 62 ? C. ) to 15o ? F. ( 65 ? C. ) for 30 minutes . To pasteurize by the Flash Method heat to 158 ? F. ( 7o ? C. ) quickly and cool immediately . CREAM If you want cream you can get it by setting ' the milk , as soon as it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cream floats to the surface . You can get it off with a i , fleeter ' or skimmer ( a little metal dish with holes in it ) , or by setting it in a wide slate trough with a hole in the bottom , the hole bunged up with a stick . When the cream has risen pull the stick out ; the skimmed milk will run through the hole and leave the cream sticking to the bottom of the trough . You can also put the milk , fresh , through a eparator . This is a centrifuge , and separates the cream from/the milk by whirling both round and r : and whereupon the heavier milk is flung outwards and the lighter cream is forced inwards . We have a separator . It is very good , but as it takes some time to clean and reassemble we only use it if we have a lot of milk to deal with . It is more efficient than setting ' . Set cream has 20 per cent butter fat ; separated cream has 35 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally very thin ( practically no butter fat at all ) but is still rich in vitamins and minerals , and marvellous for all young animals and for pigs . To make Devonshire cream , set your fresh milk for 12 hours , scald to 187 ? F. ( 92 ? C. ) , cool for 24 hours and then skim . BUTTER Butter is made by bashing cream about after it has ripened ' , which means after the lactic acid bacteria have got to work long enough to turn some of the lactose , or milk sugar , into lactic acid . Commercially the cream is pasteurized and then 57 inoculated with a pure culture of lactic acid bacteria . This is why shop butter is so reliably uniform , and so reliably dull . We make butter by keeping the cream for at least 24 hours ( twice a day we add some more to it ? but the last lot to be put in must be left in for at least twelve hours before churning ) and then churning . Nowadays we have a small glass churn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes about five minutes at the longest ? often not more than one minute . In theory the cream should be ripened at 68 ? F. ( 2o ? C. ) , but we ca n't be so theoretical . Before we had the electric paddle we used a variety of churns . If you have plenty of cream , say the cream from three cows , you can usefully use one of those beautiful varnished wooden butter churns , that turn end-over-end . A wooden cylinder open at the top , with a plunger in it that was worked up and down , was one way of doing it . A blow ' churn , which is a glass jar with a hand-operated paddle turning in it , is very good if you can get c ne . Anything that gives the cream a good bashing will do . The whole secret is to get the cream properly ripened first . If you have trouble try keeping it at a higher temperature , and try adding some existing sour milk or cream as a starter ' . If all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid bacteria , but I never met anybody who had to do that . If the butter wo n't come ' , do n't go on churning hopelessly for hours . Put it in the warm , if it is too cold , and wait a few hours , and try again . Do n't get it too warm though : 68 ? F. ( 2o ? C. ) is about right . When the butter comes ' a dramatic thing happens . Suddenly your cream separates into butter milk , and a mass of little yellow pellets as big as Number Six shot . If it is too hot the pellets will be larger , and soft : if too cold they will be smaller . Drain the butter milk out , and put it to one side . It is a most noble drink , and if I had enough butter milk to drink I do n't think I would often drink anything else . Now put plenty of cold water in your butter , churn again and drain . The whole purpose now is to wash the butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cream you made the butter // from was quite sour . The butter milk is beautifully sour . But the butter must not be the least bit sour . Therefore , if you want your butter to keep well and not go rancid , wash and wash again . Wash until the water comes out quite clear . Squodge the butter up in the cold water as much as you like . Squeeze the water out of it again . Dump the butter out on to a clean board ? wash and squeeze ? wash and squeeze . The oldfashioned wooden butter-maker was a wonderful tool  --  I wish I had one . Sprinkle salt on , according to taste , squodge the butter about hard , taste a bit . If it 's too salt wash some salt out with fresh water and taste again . If it 's not salt enough add some more salt and squodge again . Obviously you must squodge until the salt is evenly mixed right through the butter . If 2.5 per cent of the whole butter consists of salt ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter will keep for a long time . Unsalty butter wo n't keep for so long unless you keep it in the deep freeze . Always wrap butter ? light and air oxydize the unsaturated fatty acids called oleic and linoleic and cause rancidity . Rancidity is caused in wrapped butter by the decomposition of butyrin into butyric acid . If you heat butter you drive off the volatile fats which cause rancidity , and your butter then does not go rancid . Nor does it taste any more like butter , because you have lost the very elements that make it so taste . But the Indians turn this into account by making ghee ( samli in East Africa ) . If you want to preserve butter in a glut , and have no deep freeze , you can do the same . Put the butter in a pot over the fire and let it simmer for an hour . Skim the scum off . Pour it into a sterilized container , cover from the air , and it will keep many months . It wo n't taste like butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the glorious flavour of Indian food comes from the ghee in which it is cooked . But in our cooler climate you can store well-salted butter in barrels right into the winter . The barrel ( or earthenware tub ) should be scalded , dried in the wind , and the butter should be flung hard into it to exclude all air , each layer sprinkled 6o CHEESE with salt and banged down with the closed fist . All air must be driven out . If the butter is too salt when you want to use it you can always wash the salt out again . , 11 II A word here about the cleaning of all dairy implements . If you want all your dairy produce to keep well , and not taste tainted , scrupulous cleanliness is necessary in the dairy . From the hands that milk the cow , through the milking pail , setting ' pans or separator , butter churn , Scots hands ' , butter worker or draining board on which the butter is washed , cheese-making bowls , chessits , followers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cleaned of any matter sticking to them , then scalded thoroughly in boiling water , washed well in cold clean water ( and it must be clean ) , put upside-down to rinse and , if a wooden implement , put out in the clean wind iii to dry . Never use a tea-towel ' or dish cloth to dry dairy untensils . Such rags are laden with germs . If your milk starts going sour too soon you are not sterilizing something properly . Remember the sequence : scour thoroughly ( you do n't have to use#any beastly detergent , which will make your septic tank foam and stink ) , scald with boiling water , rinse immediately in clean cold water , turn upside down to drain ? in the wind if possible . Store upside down so dust does n't settle inside . CHEESE Cream cheese is terribly easy to make , but as it wo n't keep long there is no great advantage in making it , except in so far as it can be very pleasant to eat . When milk goes thick on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whey into a muslin and hang it up to drip . The whey will run out , for the pigs . The curd will turn into cream cheese . You can flavour it with salt and herbs and all sorts of things . I 've heard of wrapping it in hazel leaves , then cloth , and burying in the garden for three days . But it is the making of hard cheese that is important to the self-supporter , or the self-supporting community , for here we 6i DAIRY have a way of storing the summer flush of milk ( which we can take as being free because it is all made from grass ) for the winter , when milk is scarce and expensive . For a non-vegan vegetarian community I would say that the manufacture of cheese was absolutely essential , but for any homesteader it is an enormous asset . A pound of cheese has 2,000 calories of energy in it . Meat from the fore-quarters of an ox has 1100 calories . No wonder the navigators who dug the canals all over England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their diet . Good cheese from unpasteurized milk and honest wholemeal bread gave them the strength to move mountains . To make cheese you will need some equipment . You will need a cheese press ( unless you make Stilton , which is unpressed ) , a chessit and a follower . The chessit is a cylindrical barrel open at the top and with holes in it to let out the whey . The follower is a piston which goes down in it and presses the cheese : just a round wooden board , in fact . The press is an arrangement of levers , heavy weights and gears capable of putting , in some cases , up to two tons of pressure on the cheese , by means of the follower inside the chessit . You can still buy old cheese presses in the countryside , but as more and more self-supporters ' come about they are getting very scarce . It should not be beyond the wit of man to make one . A car jack is capable of exerting enough pressure but it would be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sense ) would have to be brought into play again . You can get cheese presses from Messrs . Clares ( Wells ) Ltd. , Somerset . The making of good , and consistently good , hard cheese is a very difficult and extremely complicated operation . Many an old farmer 's wife , in the days before acidimeters and pure cultures of this and that , and all the rest of the scientific stuff were invented , turned out fine cheese year after year : probably much better than most of the cheese that is made today under the most scientific conditions . But one must remember that the farmer 's wife in question had inherited her dairy from her // mother or mother-in-law , had been taught to make the local cheese as a child , and had developed what was almost an instinct to tell her just when to do each separate operation with the same precision as the modern cheese-maker with his thermometers and acidimeters . That craft and that skill have now died out : killed by the onslaught of shiploads of factory-made cheese from over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm cheese-making illegal , like spying for the enemy , and which killed by stupid legislation , so many of our inherited country skills and crafts . Sally and I sailed a boat to Holland once , and tied up on a canal at a remote farm , and there found the farmer , his wife , and no less than sixteen children . The cowshed was attached to the dwelling house ( an excellent arrangement ) and the farmer milked sixteen cows . I asked him , in my foolishness , if he had a milking machine . He pointed to his children and said : What do I want with a milking machine ? ' He turned all his surplus milk into cheese : huge/ cart-wheel cheeses , some of which were nieuw kaas or new cheese , and eaten after two months , and others oud kaas , which was soaked in brine and then kept in the great cheese cellar for a year . We tried both , and they were both delicious beyond any telling of it . We bought a whole nieuw kaas and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last slice was as delicious as the first . This cheese was made completely traditionally , with no scientific instruments at all , and Meneer van de Poel told me they never had a bad cheese . The Dutch cheese ( Gouda and Edam ) that is sent to England is specially made for the English market out of pasteurized separated milk in big factories . The Dutch themselves will not eat factory-made cheese . Much Dutch cheese is sent to France , and the French will not buy factory-made cheese . Only farm cheese is sold to the domestic market in Holland and to France . Only the English will take the factory-made stuff . Let us get back to our self-supporter 's cheese : the selfsupporter is not starting with an inherited lore of cheese making , and therefore he must use every aid available to him . The main aids are a thermometer and an acidimeter . Sally // has been making cheese for the last fifteen years without the use of the latter , and I will describe the way she does it with , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to pretend that every Sally cheese from the year dot has been a prizewinner because that is not the case . I know a woman who makes cheese by more or less this method ( without an acidimeter ) and for many years she made the most splendid cheese in the world . You could not have found better cheese had you searched the Earth to the Antipodes , and it was a standing invitation to gluttony . But suddenly her cheese lost its fine quality , although she did not alter her methods in the least degree . Why ? A change of bug ? No one knows . I think that she should now turn to the acidimeter , and perhaps also starter too , and then perhaps she would discover the reason for her falling-off . But this is more or less the way in which Sally makes cheese . Because she generally only milks one cow , and in the summer there is a big demand with us for fresh milk , she generally has to save up several days ' milk to get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What should happen is that you keep the evening 's milk , and in the morning you dump the morning 's milk into it . Then you make your cheese . This sounds trivial , but in fact it is very important . But before you dump the morning 's milk in with the evening 's milk you have to go through a little rigmarole with the cream of the evening 's milk , for if you do n't the cream wo n't mix back again with the milk ( it has all come to the surface in the night of course ) and you will lose the cream in the whey which you give to the pigs and have thin ' cheese . What you do is to fleet the cream off the evening 's milk ( skim it ) , raise its temperature to 85 ? F. ( 3o ? C. ) , and dump it back in the milk again . Then stir it well in . Then dump in the morning 's milk . If you have starter put it in now . I will discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally has never used it , but that does not mean to say that it would not be better if she did . Raise the temperature of the milk to 90 ? F. ( 32 ? C. ) . Put z teaspoonful of rennet in a cupful of cold water and // put it in . ( Rennet from R. J. Fullwood and Bland , 25 Bevenden Street , London N.1 . ) Stir for about five minutes with your hand . As soon as the milk begins to cling to your fingers when you pull them out stop stirring . Another test is to drop a drop of water in the milk . If the water just disappears go on stirring . If it stays on top in a globule then stop . This again sounds trivial , but it is very important to get it right . The thing is , if you do n't stir you will lose the cream from your milk and your cheese will be thin . Now as soon as you can no longer go on stirring begin to stroke the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly curved metal disc with a handle with holes in it , used for fleeting , or skimming , cream off milk ) in order to send the cream down ' . Do this for a few minutes . When the curd no longer sticks to your hand , but feels firm when you press it , i.e. in about fifty minutes from when you stopped stirring , cut the curd . You will have by then curds and whey . Cut the curds ( which do n't take much cutting ) , either with a knife or , if you have them , with a pair of American curd knives . The latter are multi-bladed knives , one with vertical blades and one with horizontal . Your aim is to cut the curd into cubes about i inch square . So with curd knives you will obviously make one pass with the horizontal blades and two , at right angles to each other , with the vertical . No more . If you just have to use an ordinary knife cut diagonally from one side of the receptacle , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubes inch square . You do n't have to measure them of course ? it 's not that critical . Warm the curds and whey very slowly ? not quicker than a rise of one degree in three minutes ? to 1 oo ? F. ( 38 ? C. ) . While this warming is going on stir the curds and whey very gently with the hand . If you stir too hard you will lose cream which is the one thing you want to avoid . This particular heating is called the scalding . It is not done for every cheese , Stilton for example . If you have a water jacketed cheese vat this raising of the temperature of course is easy : if you have not the best way to do it is to scoop a saucepanful of whey out , put it on the stove , // heat it , and put it back again . Go on repeating this until you have got the whole to oo ? F. The next operation , which is a non-operation , is called pitching . All you do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its whey , and you do n't stir it or anything , but what you do do is keep testing for acidity . For the idea of the pitching is to give the lactic acid bacteria time to work and attain a certain degree of acidity , and it is most important that this acidity should be just right . If you do not use an acidimeter the way to test for acidity is to take a piece of curd , touch it on a hot iron ( the hot stove-top will do ) and draw it away . If the acidity is just right threads of just half an inch long will come off from the curd before they break . If they are shorter than this leave to pitch longer . If they are longer than half an inch you are going to have a dry acid cheese and there 's nothing you can do about it . So when the threads are just half an inch ? drain of the whey . Into the pig bucket with it . It has done its work of raising the acidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of wrapping the curd into bundles about nine inches across in cheese cloth and leaving them on a sloping surface so that the whey can gently drain out of them . Turn the bundles from time to time . Then milling . If you have n't got a curd-mill ( and why should you have ? ) get some of those guitar-playing friends of yours , see that they wash their hands carefully , and exhort them to break the curd up into pieces as big as walnuts . And salting . Chuck an ounce of salt in to every 4 lbs of curd and mix well through . Now take your chessit , which is a cylinder of wood or metal , line it with a cheese cloth , and load your walnut-size pieces into it . Wrap the cloth over the top of it all and put it in your cheese press . Apply about a couple of stone of pressure . In other words very light . After say six hours pull the cheese out , take the cloth off it and wring it out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn the cheese , and return it to the chessit . Apply half a cwt. pressure . // Leave it thus for two days , turning it once . Then give it half a ton pressure for a couple of days , turning it once . Take it out , paste on clean bandages with flour and water , put it on a clean shelf ( very important ) in a well-ventilated store with a temperature of about 550 to 6o ? F. ( 13 ? to 16 ? C. ) , turn it every day for a week , then turn about twice a week ; always brush mould off it and suffer not cheese mites to exist . Contrary to general belief they are not a good thing . Some people dip the whole thing in wax after a week or two 's drying and I think this is a very good idea . If you try the above method and find it not satisfactory just try the following process . Omit the scalding . Instead take the i inch cubes of curd out of the whey as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to your cheddaring process , tightening the cloth from time to time . After twenty minutes start doing the hot iron test . When you get your half-inch threads , mill . If this still does not please you try scalding as before , but to a higher temperature , say to o7 ? F. ( 42 ? C. ) . There are two things to remark on : ( I ) do n't try to make cheese in the winter : it 's economically crazy anyway and furthermore much more difficult ; ( 2 ) the bigger cheeses you can make the better . You should get about i 4 lbs . of fresh cheese from a gallon of milk , and about fib. when it is fully ripened . If you can get , say , ten gallons together with your morning and evening milking , and can cope with this quantity , you will have a decent sized cheese . Personally I would not go to the trouble of making cheese from the milk of just one cow , but in this Sally would disagree with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure a rapid development of the sort of bacteria you want ? lactic acid bacteria . The way to do this , obviously , is to put in a lot of lively lactic acid bacteria , and that is your starter . Many cheese makers do not use starter , but you may find you have to . You can buy pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria ( from Messrs . Harsens Lab. , Reading , or The Somerset Farm Institute , Kennington , Bridgwater , Somerset , amongst other places ) // but you can also make your own starter . You can only do it in the summer time . Take a quart of clean milk from a healthy cow . Do not include the first few squeezes of the cow 's tits ? these are heavily infected with bacteria : in any case they should always be given to the cow-shed cat . Milk with clean hands into a sterilized bucket ( boiling water ? then cold water ? then upside down ) . Strain the milk through a sterile pad of cotton wool into a sterilized bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows open . Now I am assuming that your dairy is clean , for this is essential . The air of a dairy is teeming with lactic acid bacteria , which are the chaps you want . Keep the quart of milk as near as you can between 700 to 750F. ( 21 to 240C . ) . The quart of milk will curdle . Now we are only half way there . Take some milk ( fresh milk that has been through the separator is best because it is better without the butter fat : but the milk must be fresh ? not long from the cow ) . Pasteurize it by scalding it to 185 ? F. ( 85 ? C. ) and keeping it there for 10 minutes and then cooling it quickly ( by standing the saucepan in cool running water ) to 70 ? to 750F. ( 21 ? to 240C . ) . Skim the top off your quart of curdled milk and give the skimming to the cat ( or eat it yourself ) . Then dump the rest of the curdled milk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , is heavily inoculating sterile milk with lactic acid bacteria . Cover with a muslin cloth and keep between 7o ? to 75 ? F. ( 210 to 240C . ) . Keep thus for 24 hours . Skim the surface off and what is left is your starter , and can be added to the milk from which you are going to make your cheese . You can keep this starter going , by , every day or so , adding some of it to more pasteurized milk . The use of starter takes some risk out of cheese making but remember the best cheese in the world is made without it . Is this trouble worthwhile ? Well , if you are making a lot of cheese for export ' ( I mean to sell off the holding ) , or if // you are the cheese-making brother or sister in a fair sized community , then I would say it is . You will get more consistently good cheese . And really it takes longer to read this than it does to do it . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , so you do n't have to look at the hook , you can really do them quite quickly and easily . Assuming that you have to make a large quantity of cheese and wish to do it at least semi-professionally , and have not inherited a dairy , complete with all the right bacteria with a pedigree of a million generations on the same soil , and ten human generations of skill from your maternal grandmother , I will describe the way in which Cheddar cheese is made on the few farms which still make it . I have chosen Cheddar because it is a straight-forward cheese which will keep . A full sized Cheddar should weigh near on 100 pounds , should not be cut into for six months at least , is better after nine months , and if properly made and carefully kept it will be good the second winter after it is made . Do not be put off by the word Cheddar ' remembering all the dull Cheddar ' mouse-trap you have bought at the shops . Factory-made cheese , from pasteurized milk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place you will need a means of testing the acidity of your milk and whey and curd . In the second place you will need a cheese vat . The vat should be an oblong box , lined ideally with stainless steel but wood will do ( if it does n't leak ) . The advantage of metal though is that it can be either heated or cooled by hot or cold water or steam passed round it in a jacket . Professional cheese makers will want one of these because they represent an enormous saving of time and labour . Old-fashioned cheese ladies just used a wooden tub . It is an advantage if the vat can be lifted up at one end so that the whey can drain downhill away from the curd . There should be a tap at the bottom at one end . If you do n't get a water jacketed vat make do with a plain rectangular bin ? of wood or metal ? and raise your temperature when need be by the laborious process of dipping out whey , heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , taking out some more from the other end , etc . Professional vats can be got from Messrs . Clares ( Wells ) Ltd. , Wells , Somerset . Acid . Milk can not be made into cheese until the acidity of the milk has been raised by the action of bacteria . There are a number of bacteria which can do this , but the most beneficial from the cheese-maker 's point of view is Bacillus acidi lactici . These little creatures convert one molecule of lactose into four molecules of lactic acid thus : These bacteria eventually kill themselves with their own pollution . Like humans on this planet they eventually reach such numbers that their planet ' ( the milk tub ) is not big enough to support them and , by their excessive numbers , they pollute their environment ( by turning it too acid ) to such an extent that they die , and other bacteria , which can withstand and exploit this situation , take over . These latter are putrefactive bacteria and they turn milk bad . There is all the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and highly beneficial ) and bad milk , which is not beneficial at all . The mystique of cheese making consists entirely of doing all the operations at exactly the right degree of acidity . The kind of cheese you make , and the quality of that cheese , depends entirely upon this factor of the correct acidity . The correct acidities of the material at the various stages in the making of Cheddar , in the summer time , are as follows : CHEESE The manner in which you test this acidity is much simpler than it sounds . Take 10 cc of the milk or whey . Add to it three or four drops of phenol phthalein solution . Put a measured amount of N/9 solution of caustic soda in a burette . That is fill the burette up to the level indicated on it . Drip the caustic soda solution drop by drop into the whey or milk , stirring and watching carefully . As soon as the whey or milk gets -a pink tinge , stop . Read off how much caustic soda solution you have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for you you can read the acidity of the sample straight off on the burette . To do this takes much less time than to read about it . You can buy a Dairy Acidimeter from : Astell Lab . Service , 172 Brownhill Road , Catford , London S.E.6 . It consists of the burette on a stand , a bowl , a bottle of phenol phthalein , a bottle of N/9 ( or Standard ) caustic soda , a pipette for measuring the milk or whey , and glass stirring rods . You do not have to be a Ph.D . Chemistry to use it ; any good cook-general could learn to do it in five minutes . Farmhouse Cheddar . Cool your evening 's milk ( if the weather is hot ) and leave overnight . Skim the cream off in the morning ? heat that cream on the stove ? pour it back again . You do this to mix the cream back with the milk . Dump in your morning 's milk . Add 2 gallon starter ( optional ) to 1 oo gallons milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 add 4 fluid oz. rennet per 1 oo gallons . The milk should be 84 ? F. ( 3o ? C. ) when you do this . Deep-stir for 4 to 5 minutes . Then top-stir only . You know when to stop deep-stirring when the milk clings to your hands . About ten minutes after the rennet has gone in coagulation occurs . The acidity goes down as it coagulates . When it is exactly o ? 14 cut the curd . You will have to have American curd knives to do this effectively . Stir by hand ? very carefully and gently . Do n't bash the curd about or bruise it or you will lose cream . Slowly ( 1 degree F. every three minutes ? not quicker ) raise 7 1 DAIRY the temperature to 9o ? F. ( 32 ? C. ) . Heat a little quicker ( i degree F. every two minutes ) to 100 ? F. ( 38 ? C. ) . Stop heating . Stir by hand until a handful of the curd feels firm and springy . Keep stirring until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the curd to soak in its whey . Keep testing for acidity . When whey squeezed from a handful of curd is 0.21 acid drain off the whey . Cheddaring . This is the process of wrapping the drained blocks of curd into cloths and leaving them on the dry bottom of the sloping vat so that the whey keeps dribbling out of them , turning them occasionally until the acidity has reached 0.75 to as much as 0.95 . If you have not got your acidimeter here you can test by the hot iron test ( on the stove top ) . You should be able to draw threads off your hot iron in your whey at least I2 inches long . Then mill . You can buy a cheese mill or you can get all your communiteers around ( after they have very thoroughly washed their hands ) and break the curd up by hand to the size of walnuts . Add 24 lbs . salt to 100 lbs . curd ( say from your ioo gallons milk ) . Thoroughly mix the salt with the milled curd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the advantage of having a vat with a cooling jacket . ) Put the curd cloths in chessits which should be 15 inches high and 15 inches in diameter . This will give you a 100 lbs . cheese , which is a cheese worth having . Put in press and press lightly until the whey begins to run , then give it i o cwt. for three or four hours , pull out , turn , rinse cloth and chessit with warm water , then give it 25 cwt . Next day remove and bathe cheese in water at 130 ? F. ( 540C. ) for 30 seconds , return to press and give it 40 cwt . Third day pull it out again , rub all over with lard or butter , bandage with clean calico and press again at two tons . On the fourth day remove from press , bandage again and this time sew bandage on ( some people do n't bandage but rub with lard oil every day for a week ) . Write date on it , put it on // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then every other day for another month . Some people soak it in brine for three days . The store should be airy and 6o ? to 8o ? F. ( 15 ? to 250C . ) . All this is a lot of work , but consider , to buy too lbs . of cheese would cost you , at 65 ? a pound , $65 ! For the value of three cheeses you can buy a cow . And you wo n't get cheese at that price now and if you did it would have nothing like the quality of the cheese you can make for yourself . I am not suggesting that the lone homesteader should make cheese on this scale , unless he intends to make it a major item of his foreign exchange trade . After all , to get too gallons of milk in two milkings he will need from twenty to twenty-five cows in milk . But for communities this might well be the scale on which cheese would be made , with one specialist in charge of the making , and perhaps two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other days . But the lone homesteader could well use the same scientific care with his temperatures and acidities with his cheeses made from say ten gallons of milk . Sally keeps milk from more than two milkings to make up enough for a cheese . If she used the acidimeter test she could do this far more reliably . And milk kept over from more than two milkings would certainly not need starter added , it would reach the required acidity ( o.19 ) without that . When one kind of cheese has been mastered no doubt the enthusiastic cheese maker will want to experiment . Gruyere , and the other holey cheeses , are made with fresh cow 's milk ( straight from the cow ) with no starter , curdled with rennet , and kept at 86 ? F. ( 3o ? C. ) . The acidity here is mostly caused by Bacillum bulgaricum and a gas is formed which causes the holes . Stilton should have extra cream added ( I wonder how many Stiltons do nowadays ! ) and should be inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But when the cheese maker gets to this stage he will wish to get some more literature on the subject anyway . If you want to make yoghourt , get a good live yoghourt , put some in milk warmed to about blood heat , keep it in a closed container not too far from the stove , use a little every day , and // add a little fresh milk every day , and go on as long as it keeps pleasant . A Poor Man 's Cheese ' described in Food in England and apparently once made in Scotland , which has the advantage of being a one cow ' cheese , is made by putting milk in a pot over a slow fire . Let it curdle , leave in the whey that night , drain the whey off next morning , cut the curd up and salt it , tie tightly in a linen cloth , hang to drip all day , retie tightly and hang up for four weeks . If you hang it in a net it will have a nice pattern . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If some butter be worked into the curd and the cheese kept for three or four months it will be very good . I have never tried this but at least it sounds simple . Any method of preserving the summer milk for the winter is good . 74 6 Pig A couple of flitches of bacon are worth fifty thousand Methodist sermons and religious tracts . WILLIAM COBBETT : Cottage Economy If you have a cow you will ultimately find yourself making butter , and perhaps cheese , and then you will have skimmed milk and whey and what are you going to do with these ? You can , in fact , fatten ducks or chickens on milk products , but the best use to which you can put them is to feed them to the pigs . Also , your fields and garden will by now be yielding you much waste that you can not eat yourself . There is very little that a pig will not eat . True , you can compost vegetable waste , but show me a better way of composting anything than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are several ways in which you can have pigs . For the individual or community seriously intent on being self-supporting the obvious purpose of the job is to have pigs to kill for meat . There is nothing wrong , though , in having a surplus to sell , or to trade with other people for other produce . Other considerations are : the fewer pigs you have the more completely you will be able to feed them on the waste products of your farm . A gallon of skimmed milk a day will go a long way to fattening a pair of baconers , but spread among a dozen its effect is not so noticeable : in fact you will have to feed them primarily on other food , the high protein part of it probably bought in . You are thus getting further from the idea of being self-supporting . But , say you only want two pigs , how are you going to get them ? To be truly self-supporting you must breed them yourself . So you must have at least one sow . Now she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty piglets in a year 75 PIG ( ours always used to give us twenty-four , never more , never less ) . You need two pigs to kill for your family . But of course you can always sell the others as weaners ( that is at eight or ten weeks old , straight off the sow ) . But all this forces you to be in pigs in a bigger way . Then from where do you get the boar ? You ca n't afford a boar to serve one sow . There are boar walkers ' though , who go around carrying a boar in the back of a van , and who will come when you telephone them , provided you can catch your sow when she is on heat , which is not always easy . But this boar problem is a problem . One answer is to have enough sows to pay the wages , as it were , of a boar . My belief is that if you have six sows , or even as low as four , and they pay you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But again it drives you into a bigger and bigger commitment in pigs . From a man wanting a couple of baconers for his family you now become a pig farmer . Of course the whole problem is eased if you are part of a like-minded community . Either the community can keep the boar in the centre , as it were , and lend him out to the cornmuniteers , or else one member of the community can do all the sow keeping , and swap weaners for other produce . I say weaners ; this is ecologically a sounder method than that the one pig keeper should fatten the pigs too , and simply trade pig meat with the other people . The pigs do better , and more good , and are fed more cheaply , if they are spread out among everybody . But if you are on your own , and do n't want to go into all the intricacies of sow keeping , you can simply buy a pair or more of weaners . I will personally have no part in suggesting to anybody that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point that the husbandman is a benevolent ruler and not a tyrant , and a benevolent ruler does not keep anybody in solitary confinement . But you can buy weaners , at this day and age , for from five to ten pounds . My advice is , if you have milk by-products , to buy the cheapest weaners you can . Normally weaners are sold at from eight to twelve weeks , and the older they are the dearer they are likely to cost . But if you have milk 76 PIG you can buy them very young ? and thus get them cheaper . Let us deal with this plan of buying weaners and fattening them first . The countryman who used to keep a pig at the bottom of the garden ( all too often alone , I fear ) used to show him to you and say : I 'm only a " growin " on him now o ' course . ' He meant that he was not feeding him a fattening ration , but just enough food to keep him growing , in good lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barley meal and the pig would be fattened . That 's no good a " fattenin " on him twice , ' the owner would say . So when you first get the weaners you should feed them well , with plenty of milk , until they get over the shock of being weaned from their mother , and then feed them on a lower diet , and keep them active and happy , until they are fully grown . Then you should confine them in a warm place and simply push the food into them . When I worked on a farm in Gloucestershire , as a boy , we fattened a hog until it was enormous : twice as big or bigger than any baconer that is killed today . We turned this pig into bacon and the bacon was nearly a hundred per cent fat . There was hardly a streak of lean in it . This bacon was never fried , but boiled . It was boiled in great chunks , and every morning the cold chunk of fat was put on the table for breakfast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled egg , and mustard . To have eaten it with butter would have been revolting , but as it was the stuff was perfectly delicious , marvellously digestible , and it kept us working at very hard manual labour , out of doors in the severest winter England had had for many years , for many hours a day . This is how pigs used to be eaten . Cobbett says : Make him quite fat by all means ? the last bushel does the most good if he sit to eat it . ' He goes on to say that if the pig can walk a hundred yards he is not fat , and that lean meat is only fit for wasters and drunkards . Nowadays apparently we have a population of wasters and drunkards because the only baconers the market will accept arc ? like Cassius ? lean and hungry pigs ? such pigs are 77 PIG dangerous . The fact is , of course , that people who live hard and out of doors can relish fat bacon , and it does them good . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roses Coronary throm-bo-ses , A'seizure ! A'seizure ! We all fall down ! Animal fat only gives seizures and coronary thrombosis to people who do not get enough exercise . When this nation was fed on fat bacon and fat beef and mutton the disease was unknown . Now , as meat gets leaner and leaner until it nearly fades away , thrombosis is increasing faster than any other disease except lung cancer . It is idleness that causes diseases of the heart . True manual workers never get coronary thrombosis , and nor do self-supporters . But it 's all a matter of taste . I like fat bacon ? boiled , mind , not fried in yet more fat . If you do n't , well do n't have it ? kill your pigs when they are lean . If you want good fat bacon buy your weaners in the spring and kill them just before Christmas . At Christmas you should be eating hams killed the Christmas before ; hung a year they are so much better . And it 's nice to have some fresh pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs kept indoors all the time . If you let confined pigs out of their confinement it is pathetic to see them snort and gallop and leap about in their happiness to be free at last . During the last month or two of fattening a pig keep him indoors by all means , he seems to get his pleasure then from the thing a pig likes , after all , to do more than anything else ? eating . But until this fattening stage ? when you are a " growin " on him ' , let him out . Of course you ca n't let him run anywhere or he will do endless damage . And this is where we draw on the resources of the modern world . The electric fence is your answer . You can keep pigs in with pig netting , with a strand of well-strained barbed wire at the bottom , but it 's a running battle . Electric fence is the thing , either two single 78 PIG strands or the new electric netting which is very good . If you use single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netting behind them , for its psychological effect . Pigs are tryers . In a world with no electric fencing I would say , tether your pigs . A rope or leather harness with one strap in front of the pig 's fore-legs and another behind them will do the trick . Incidentally , if you want a quiet life never try to keep prickcared pigs , like the Large White , out of doors . The flop-eared pig is far more likely to stay behind a fence , for his ears hang down over his eyes . But while we have electricity let us use it , and part of your garden thus fenced off , and well pigged , will benefit enormously . It is the way to bare-fallow land . If you like you can grow a fodder crop ( see Chapter 14 ) and put the pigs into that , or you can put the pigs into your potato patch after you have harvested it ( the pigs will find the last potato ) or you can just bare fallow . On a small enough area the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there long enough even the horrid perennial weeds like spear grass or twitch . They will bring valuable elements up from the subsoil , they will heavily manure the land , and they will leave it twice as valuable as it was before . Do n't ring them . Let them dig . Do n't expect a couple of pigs to do much good to half an acre though , concentrate them . Meanwhile you have got to feed them something as well as what they can find for themselves . While they have plenty of milk ( skimmed milk is just as good for them as whole milk would be ) milk mixed into bran or other wheat offal is all they need . Milk and barley meal are very good too , but unnecessarily expensive , if you can sell your barley or have to buy it . In the fattening stage milk and barley meal is the finest food you can give them . If you ca n't give them milk then you will have to buy in some protein . The easiest thing to do is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easiest . They are big and wo n't get trodden into the ground easily . Just throw them clown at half the rate recommended on the bag and let the pigs hunt for them . Or you can buy fish meal and mix it with any 79 PIG kind of meal at the rate of about ten per cent fish meal . Or twenty per cent beans in a mash will give them enough protein : feed them as much as they can clear up in twenty minutes and squeal for more . You can give the pigs all your small or misshapen potatoes . You can often buy stock feed ' potatoes at very little a ton , or spoiled carrots ( but if these have been washed they wo n't keep ) or other spoiled food . Kitchen swill is always fine for pigs . I know a man who buys tons of stale bread from a bakery and his wife has to spend hours pulling the wrappers off sliced loaves . ( Ugh ! ) Fodder crops you can grow specially are fodder beet , carrots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important on light land anyway , Jerusalem artichokes . The latter are marvellous ; they grow in the roughest and most weed-infested land , their foliage smothers everything , and the pigs thrive by rooting them up . Take the pigs to the artichokes though , not the artichokes to the pigs . Let the pigs do the work . Or plant a special pig field , a field you want to pig ' anyway , to clean it and fertilize it . Plant , say , a strip of Jerusalem artichokes , one of fodder beet , one of kale . Give them a little of all three . Then , when they have cleared that up , move them on . Variety is the spice of life . Always keep a pig bucket in the scullery . When we have a pigless period we do n't know what to do . What do we do with that lovely greasy rich washing-up water ? Criminal to throw it down the sink . What do we do with the celery tops , the potato peelings , the carrot tops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do with the bean and pea haulms , the sweet corn tops , the scythed nettles , the pulled-out weeds ? If we have pigs they will either eat it or tread it into the soil as good compost . As for how much concentrated food to give your pigs , give them as much as they will clear up quickly . If there is any left after half an hour give them less next day . Keep them a little hungry for concentrates . As for housing , if pigs are running out of doors they will need the minimal , but they will need some . They will need a dry place and some shelter from the rain . That is all . What 8o PIG form it takes every man must decide for himself as long as it is the cheapest and easiest , and the most mobile , for you will be dragging it around with the pigs . You can buy Pigloos . Now for sows and pig breeding . I will say very little about this , only that sows thrive out of doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two long . At a high rate of stocking I like to move pigs on to fresh ground at least once every six weeks , otherwise a worm infestation builds up and the pigs suffer . Let loose in a wood pigs do wonders . If you give them two pounds of pig nuts a day when they are dry that will do them . After they have farrowed though you must give them from six to eight , depending upon how much other food they can get and how many piglets they have . All this business of feeding animals is common sense really . You can find pages of complicated instructions and tables and starch equivalents and all the rest of it in the text books but if you just keep animals , and watch them carefully , and note whether they are growing or not , are hungry or not , and use your common sense , you do n't need a whole lot of scientific gobble-de-gook . As to housing and mangement of breeding sows , there must be a shelter ? no matter how rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less waterproof ? available for a sow , for her sole use , when she farrows . That is all . The books will tell you to put no litter in a farrowing pen . We put as much litter in as the sow thinks she needs . Throw straw or bracken or what have you outside if you like ; before the sow farrows she will carry as much as she needs in herself in her mouth . We then leave the sows completely alone . Do n't go near them . We have never worried about farrowing rails ( although there 's nothing wrong with them ) nor infra red lights , or any of the rest of it . In eight years at the Broom we kept sows all the time , up to six of them , and our losses of piglets were as nearly nil as it was possible for them to be . In eight years I seem to remember burying two piglets . Once you start to interfere with nature , with sows , you 've got to interfere more and more . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to confine them even more , on concrete . Keep them on concrete and they ca n't 8i PIG get iron , so you have to inject the piglets with it or they get anaemia . Farrow them in a confined space with plenty of straw and they get confused and smother the piglets . So you give them no straw . They then lose their natural chain of instinctual actions ? nest-making and all the rest of it ? so they lay on , or eat , their piglets . They are mixed up . So you confine them in a farrowing crate where they ca n't move at all and attract the piglets away from them with a warm infra red light . And the piglets get virus pneumonia . So you go in for embryotomy . You kill the sow and take the piglets out of her belly in aseptic conditions and bring them up in sterile boxes . This is actually being done on a large scale in America and more and more in England . Pigs are now being kept , all their lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tiny wire cages like battery hens . Where do you go from there ? Right back , I should say , to keeping sows under the most natural conditions possible , allowing their proper chain of instincts to work itself out . We used to get a pound a head more for our piglets than other weaner producers because the fatteners knew they would never get virus pneumonia . They had spent their lives running about in the open air , and getting what minerals they wanted straight from the soil , and they were as tough and hardy as wild boars. 82 7 Bacon Meat in the house is a great source of harmony . WILLIAM COBBETT : Cottage Economy Slaughtering . In most parts of Britain at least there is a public slaughterhouse somewhere in the vicinity ; although these get fewer and fewer and further and further as the great philosophy of the twentieth century ? Bigger Means Better ? has its sway . Where at one time a bullock was quietly walked a mile or two to the village slaughterhouse , rested in the butcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning , now he is crammed into the back of a huge cattle truck with thirty others , banged and lurched , terrified , over up to a hundred miles of roads , forced bellowing into a blood-reeking meat factory and eventually slaughtered . All in the sacred name of Progress . However , if there is a slaughterhouse not too far away you can send your pig , or pigs , there and have them slaughtered for a fee . You have to get them in there though , pay for the job to be done , and go and fetch the meat back again . You make , in other words , four journeys . It is therefore very much better , if you can , to slaughter them yourself . In most real country districts there is at least one man who will kill you a pig for a small fee . He makes it part of his living . Or perhaps there is a friendly village butcher who will do it for you . If you can entertain such a man with friendship and home brewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the more likely to come and do it again . Pig killing may seem to the townsman to be a brutal and grisly business , but in fact the occasion can have a kind of boozey , bucolic , charm .

I have killed three pigs a year // for sixteen years and only once ( when I first began ) did I have to use a second shot . I lure the pig quietly out of his sty into the cow shed with a little food in a bucket ( he has had no supper the night before ) and put the food into a dish . As the pig starts to eat the food I shoot him in the brain . Anywhere in the head will stun him actually , but I always shoot him in the brain . Draw a line with your imagination from his left ear-hole to his right eye , and from his other ear-hole to his other eye , and where the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thus with a humane killer because he would not stand still for you .

Therefore if you use a humane killer you will have to rope your pig ( getting a slipping noose in his mouth and round his snout ) and he will squeal and struggle , and his last moments will be violent and unhappy and not perfectly peaceful as they should be . The .22 is by far the kindest way to kill a pig . One moment he is happily eating ? the next moment he is in Heaven . Immediately you have shot him stick him in the front of the neck . The place to stick seems easy to see in practice . Suffice to say that you should use a shortish knife ( 6 inches is long enough ) , stick it two inches in front of his breastbone at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizontal line of the pig and keep it dead central . You can easily feel the breastbone if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in front of it and at an angle of 45 degrees up towards the back of the pig . Thus will you cut both the carotid arteries and the jugular vein . Two things will happen . One is that blood will gush out in great quantity and now is the time for your wife to be at hand to catch it in a basin if she wants to make black pudding and has a stronger stomach than most people 's wives ( our blood goes down the drain I am afraid ) , and , secondly , the pig will begin to kick as though it is trying to win the Grand National . Let it kick , and remember it can feel nothing ? its soul is in Heaven playing a porcine harp . If your wife has caught the blood , incidentally , she must stir it or whip it immediately otherwise it will clot . // We thereupon haul our pig up on a tackle , to make sure that all the blood drains out . Most people do n't bother . Scalding and Dissecting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing scalding water . We used to but now do not . We went through a phase of pouring methylated spirits over the pig and lighting it and letting it burn like a Christmas pudding but have given that up too . Now we do what all the local Pembrokeshire people do around here , we let the pig lie on the concrete floor and pour the scalding water over the pig . The object of this is so that you can scrape the bristles off the pig . Now great skill is needed for this , and this is one of the arts that you had better learn from your local expert . The water must be from 145 ? to 150 ? F. ( 63 ? to 66 ? C. ) and no more . If it is too cold it wo n't get the bristles out ; if it is too hot it will fix ' them and you 'll never get them out . The local wise man will know whether the water is right by looking into it ( as a brewer does ) . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or he will put one part of cold water into three parts of boiling water . That is as good . You must have plenty of hot water ready ? ten gallons is not too much . Pour some of the scalding water over part of the pig slowly ? then keep plucking at the bristles . Suddenly they will come out easily in your fingers . Now is the time to start scraping . Do n't scrape with a knife , the lid of a tin is ideal , or a tin coffee-pot lid . Do n't cut the skin . Just scrape until the bristles come out and if the pig started off by being a black pig , it will end up as a white pig . Colour , in pigs as in humans , is not even skin deep . Meanwhile your **32;393;TOOLONG neighbour is busy pouring more water on a different place . Scrape away . Put each trotter right into a jug of scalding water , pull it out , scrape it , and yank the horny hoof off with a pair of pincers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig will be clean . Do his head too ? every part of him . Suffer not a bristle to remain and mar his beauty . Besides hot water you need plenty of home brew to go with this operation . Now hock ' your pig , or ham string him , that is cut behind // the tendons ( gam strings ) at the back of his hind legs just above the hoof . A glance at a pig carcass in a butcher 's shop will show you how to do this . This tendon , although slender , is amazingly strong . Put the ends of a gamble through these tendons . A gamble is a spreader : a metal or wooden stick , maybe fifteen inches long , hung from its middle by a block tackle , and with flattened out and curving ends for hanging a pig on . See them also in any butcher 's shop . Now split the breastbone of the pig with knife and chopper . Do this immediately . Haul the pig off the ground with the tackle . We always cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifies things to do so . Some people leave the head on and split it when they split the pig , but you can not do this until next day . We cut the head off at the first vertebra and put it where no flies can get to it ( but normally we kill pigs in the winter when there are no flies , and I do not recommend killing them in the summer anyway ) and now we gut it . This takes skill , and common sense . Get on a chair behind the pig and encircle its anus with the point of the knife . You do this so that the bowel will drop out when you get the guts out and not tear , leaving the anus behind where you do n't want it and spilling excrement all over the place . You very carefully cut the actual anus , or arse-hole , of the pig right round so as to separate it from the rest of the pig . Before you cut the last bit you grab it with one hand , cut it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a friend ( it seems a little indelicate to ask your wife ) to tie a piece of string round it . This is , as I hope you have guessed , to stop any excrement coming out of it . Now you let it go and the weight of the rest of the bowels pulls it down inside the pig . This grisly business over you get down , and round to the belly of your pig , and you very carefully insert just the point of your knife in the middle of the belly just about where our solar plexus would be . Only let the knife just cut through the skin ? you are not Jack the Ripper . Then insert your forefinger in along the back of the knife and move the knife upwards ( i.e. towards the tail of the pig ) with your forefinger acting as a guard to prevent that unforgivable happening : shoving the // knife point into the pauch or guts and thus fouling your meat . Cut right up to where the two hind legs join . Dissect out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bladder if a female . Now as you open the belly the paunch and guts will try to get out . You now see why you were told to split the breastbone while the pig was on the ground : if you had not done so the guts would be hanging down out of the pig and you would n't have been able to . Let the guts flop out into a tin bath . Carefully remove the pluck . This is the liver , heart and lungs , with a few oddments , all hung together on the windpipe or trachea . Cut the gall bladder out , very carefully so as not to splash gall over anything at all , and throw it away . Stick a hook through the windpipe and hang the pluck up in a flyproof place . We always chuck a couple of buckets of cold water into the eviscerated pig to wash the blood out of it . Some experts might tell you that this is not a good idea . I think it is though . Then go and finish the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you and your companions . About the only part of the pig that is fit to eat for supper that night is the liver . Next morning go back to your pig . He has been hanging up all night , we hope , in a nice cold draught , where neither rat nor cat can get at him . Cut a score down his back , through all that back fat , from his tail to where his head used to be , right along the central line . You can feel this for part of the way with the finger , but much depends on a good eye and judgment . Next take a light sharp chopper ? not one of your vast axes such as beheaded Mary Queen of Scots ? and chop the backbone right down the middle . Split your pig right in half . Now obviously when you pull one half of that pig off the gamble the latter will tip up and deposit the other half on the floor . You must allow for this either by tying the other half up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it off while you take your half off . And half a large baconer is very heavy indeed let me tell you . // Lay your half on the table and cut it into suitable joints for curing . Our plan is to lay the side skin-side down , put the knife in under the tail ( or where the tail should be ) and with the blade slanting towards the head end of the pig cut a good generous curve until you hit bone . Then start at the belly side of the pig and do the other half of the proposed generous circle until you hit the bone again . Then a few strokes of the meat saw ( or any old saw ) will cut through the bone and complete the job . Like this , as you started under the tail , you miss the spine of course . You now have what looks very much like a ham . Cut the trotter off but below the first joint , so that you have plenty of leg to hang the ham up by . Cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about nine inches from the tail ( at the point at which the spine suddenly curves upwards ) . This odd bit of meat , which is good , we use as a roasting joint in due course . It is an awkward shape for salting though . Now inside the side of the pig is the belly fat , which makes the finest lard , and this we rip out . All fat is cut into little pieces and put into a big crock , with a little water , and put into the slow oven . Do not overheat it as it will burn . From time to time pull it out of the slow oven and pour the liquid fat off it , and put it into basins ; but more of that anon . Now pull the kidney out , and then carefully cut out the tenderloin : that strip of lean meat inside the carcass near the kidney . This should be baked in due course draped with the caul of the beast : that thin membrane with dollops of fat all over it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite delicious . Separate the forequarter from the side . To do this cut right across the carcass between the 4th and 5th ribs , just behind the shoulder blade . You will now have a ham , a forequarter and a side . The side is a big one . Maybe you will prefer , for ease of handling , to split it right down the middle , sawing through the ribs , so as to leave a back and a belly . The belly will be poor tack : a thinnish sheet and mostly fat . We used to roll this and put it // in a wet pickle , but it is good for sausages . You can dry salt it , only do n't leave it in the salt for more than a week . You also have a couple of good roasting joints from where the loin was . You can cut the forequarter into joints and roast it too if you like , or you can salt it like the ham . First cut the blade bone off if you like , and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of methods of curing ham and bacon , but I will give you the simplest and most widespread , in England and Wales at least . I will just describe what we do , and what most of my neighbours do ( or such as still cure their own bacon ) . We have a big slate salting bench . We dump some dry salt on this ( you will need at least forty pounds of salt to do a pig in comfort . If you wish to be more economical with salt you will have to be a lot more careful and take a lot more trouble . We just use a lot of salt and bury the pig in it ) . Lay a ham on the salt . Sprinkle as much saltpetre as you can hold between your finger and thumb on the cut end of the ham . Take a handful of soft brown sugar and shove that on the cut end of the ham . Rub it , and the saltpetre with it , in hard . Then rub salt in , and rub in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Now I know that all the books tell you to weigh the saltpetre , and mix it thoroughly with the salt , etc. , but once you have to start messing about weighing dribs and drabs of this and that the meat will go bad while you are fussing . The method I have described has worked for perhaps a hundred hams with me and they have all been excellent . Bury the ham in salt . Do the same with all the other joints . Add enough saltpetre just for the merest sprinkling . The saltpetre is supposed to preserve the colour of the meat . I have a shrewd suspicion that if you did n't use it at all the ham would be just as good but I don't. know . You need n't use sugar , but most people do , particularly for the hams . It makes them sweeter . Squeeze the hams hard and a gout of blood will come out from a certain vein . See how much of this you can squeeze out . Then every day , for three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with salt . See that they get dry salt in contact with them all over , and put them back again , probably upside down . After three days just leave them be in the salt . Take the bellies out in a week , the sides out in a fortnight , the forequarters out in a fortnight to three weeks depending on how big they are , and the hams out in three weeks to a month ( three weeks if they are just ordinary sized hams ) . Rinse the salt off them and hang them up in an even temperature somewhere and let them dry off for a week or two . We hang ours straight in the simnai fawr . The simnai fawr is the big chimney over our fireplace open to the sky . There is a bend in this chimney so part of it is not exposed to the rain , and there are pipes up there as a rack . I hang the meat up there , high above the fire , where it gets the smoke and does not get too hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes rancid . It wants to be a good ten feet above the fire . If you have n't got a simnai fawr you can build a smoke-house , and this I will describe in Chapter i8 . Smoke for a week or a fortnight , depending how often you have the fire alight , and then take down and store . Smoking preserves meat and gives it a fine flavour but it is not necessary . Plenty of people round here do n't smoke . We store ours by just hanging it up . Many people bandage their hams and hang them up or , better still I believe , wrap them well and store them down in a chest buried in dry ashes , or dry bran or oats , but you must watch for mice or mites with the latter . This prevents the hams from drying out . If hung it should be hung in the dark , and in fresh air . When you need a bit of bacon , cut a big slice off one of the sides , bone it ( troublesome ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice it as you need it . But it is saltier than shop bacon ( which is not meant to keep ) so soak the slices in fresh water for up to half an hour before frying it . If you wish to boil a lump of it soak it for twelve hours first . Keep the hams , if you can , a full year . Scrub well , soak all night , put in water with plenty of pepper and simmer ( not boil ) for 25 minutes for every pound of ham . Let it cool in its own liquor . Eat cold . // There are plenty of sweet pickles for hams . These generally involve plunging the fresh ham into a brine made with such things as beer or cider mixed with treacle , sugar , spices and salt . Keep turning it in the pickle for , say , a month . Here is a typical cure , such as one of our Suffolk neighbours used to figure Boil it all together , cool it , soak the ham in it for a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickle . The ham was very good though . Curing bacon and ham is much simpler than people think , and if you follow the above simple instructions for the ordinary dry cure you will have no trouble and not go wrong . ( But do n't blame me if you do ? and do n't try it in the summer ! ) Now what has your faithful wife been doing while all this has been going on ? Why , the very first day she has taken the stomach and large intestine , hereinafter called the chitlings , down to a clean brook if she has one , or in the sink if she has n't , opened them and carefully washed the excrement out of them . She has then cut the large intestine into six-inch lengths ( if she does n't want it for sausage ) , put it and the stomach , also cut up , into a clean bowl , taken them back to the house , scalded with boiling water , washed in cold water , and then filled the bowl with brine . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , then she boils the stuff for two hours , lets it cool , and fries it with onions when it is perfectly delicious . Another fate waits the small intestines , and maybe the large too . These , as soon as the pig is killed or at least the next day , are separated from the fat that clings to them and unravelled . One end is put on the cold tap and the tap turned on , whereupon they writhe about like a snake , but eventually all the // excrement is washed out of them . They are then turned inside out on a smooth stick , which is easier than it sounds . They are then laid flat on a board and scraped with the back of a knife . This gets the gut lining off them . They are then coiled down tight in dry salt and put away until they are needed as sausage casings . The bladder is washed out well . A small funnel can be poked into it and hot lard poured in . The lard cools and the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the rest of the fat , as the days go by you will render out more and more beautiful white lard which you can pour into sterilized jars or bottles , cover well , when it will keep for some time . If you have a deep freeze put some of it in that to keep longest . You will have free cooking fat for a very long time indeed . Now for that grisly memento mori , the head . As soon as you have time , that first day , shove it in a big crock and fill it with brine . Let it soak for two or three days or more until you have some leisure . Then the bath chaps ( which are the cheeks ) can be cut off separately and hung in the smoke and cured . They are very delicious boiled and eaten cold with plenty of mustard . Whether you do this or not shove the head , with or without its cheeks , in a large boiler together with the trotters and any other gristly bits and simmer for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the meat off the bones . Cut the meat up small ( you can mince it if you like ) , mince six large onions , put plenty of pepper and other spices on the meat ( the more the merrier in my opinion ) , skim the fat off the soup that you boiled the meat in , put the meat back into the soup and simmer for two hours , or until the liquor is reduced to what common sense tells you it ought to be . Pour the stuff hot into basins and let cool . You now have a delicious brawn , which will keep for a month or more in a cold winter , and for ever if you bag it and put it in the deep freeze . Or you can pour it boiling into kilner jars , boil the jars for 20 minutes , and seal . Sausages . English and Welsh home-cured bacon and ham is as good as any in the world , but there is one thing that the // British have never cottoned on to , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a way ? and a delicious way of preserving meat . Our English sausages are fine to eat fresh , or to keep in the deep freeze , but it is an enormous advantage to be able to make a big glut of meat into sausages that can be hung up from the ceiling , and left for months , and one hauled down whenever you feel like it , and sliced and eaten raw . If you have bread and butter and that kind of sausage you always have a sumptuous meal waiting ready for you . We have tried dried sausage ( if one can call such a delicious thing by such a pedestrian name ) with casings from the small intestine of the pig , and these are fair enough but are too small to keep moist for very long or to provide conditions necessary for producing that succulent thing , a true , smoked , spicey and garlicky Continental sausage . To make such a thing you need the large intestine of the ox , if you can get it , or the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig , which you must treat in the same way as I have described for treating the small intestine above . You want to produce a sausage as thick as your wrist . There are a hundred different recipes for producing what I must call , for want of a better word , Continental sausage . Some of them are contained in a very useful book : Charcuterie and French Pork Cooking by Jane Grigson ( Michael Joseph ) . All such recipes call for an ounce of this and half an ounce of that and it all sounds terribly complicated , and of course by making small adjustments in the ingredients you can make small differences to your resulting sausage ; but the principles of the thing are simple enough , and if you keep the principles in mind you can make what sort of sausages you like , and very good they will be too . You need some lean meat and some fat . The lean of course will be from the cheapest ' cuts of your pig . You can put beef in too if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r part lean beef and i part belly fat of pork . Two parts of lean pork and one part of fat are a good mixture . Bacon fat will do too . // For every three pounds of lean-and-fat you need : 1 oz. salt 2 teaspoons of pepper 2 or 3 cloves of garlic As much spice of whatever sort you have Some people like a tablespoonful of brown sugar If you have n't marinated the meat in wine a glassful of any kind of wine is useful , or liquer . A big pinch of saltpetre Mince the lean meat and cut the fat into small dices ( it is the latter which gives the cut sausage that white-speckled appearance ) . We have always marinated the lean meat for twelve hours in elderberry wine and it works very well . You should really , of course , use grape wine . Or you do n't need to marinate at all . Try both . Whether or not you marinate mix the whole lot up together and stuff it all , raw as it is , into your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length you fancy , hang up in a warm dry place ? this is important ? not warmer than 7o ? F. ( 21 ? C. ) . A steady 6o ? F. is what you should aim at . If you have an Aga that never goes out nearby that is ideal . Now if you have a big open chimney , or any other kind of smoking device , hang the sausages up in it after say a week of drying and smoke them for a day and a night . Take them down and hang them in a well-aired dry place and forget them for six months . They will grow a white mould over them . Hooray . Give them at least six months ( if you can wait ) to mature . Eat them raw . But the meat will shrink a lot , and if you use large casings you will have to squeeze the meat down hard into one end of the casing once or twice during the drying to keep it tight . Then tie the skin off to keep it tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausages , to tie them round with string like Malvolio 's cross garters , and to tighten the strings from time to time to keep the sausage compressed . I have seen fine sausages made like this using the pig 's bladder , and I think this would be a very good 94 . BACON ill use for the bladder , rather than filling it with lard or blowing 111 it up like a balloon and giving it to the children to clown about with . If you do n't like so much fat do n't use so much . If you do n't like garlic do n't use it . The casing is important : you ca n't use plastic , for the reason that it can not breathe and the meat could not dry out . Bacterial action of a benign sort takes place within the sausages also and that needs the controlled transpiration that natural animal membrane can give . Remember ? nothing q is cooked . It is all raw . It may seem an insuperable obstacle that you have got to find animal large intestines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guts galore , and all 1,1 you have to do , remember , is turn the guts inside out , scrape the lining off with the back of a knife , wash well , and pack down in dry salt until you need them . Pack down close and away from air . i , i , Our getting a deep freeze , and a bigger farm , put paid to our Continental sausage-making activities . It is so much 1,1 quicker to shove everything into the deep freeze . But there is nothing to touch well spiced and smoked and well matured Continental sausage : it is perhaps the most delicious food there is . And next time you see some in a shop just enquire the price of it per ounce ? let alone per pound ! And it is very easy to make after all ; the biggest trouble is mincing the stuff and for that you must have a good mincing machine . Kenwood have a 111 mincer plus sausage-filling attachment . Fresh Pork . Your true porker is a much smaller pig than your baconer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a porker say four months . If you have a deep freeze , to kill a porker is all very well ( you do it in exactly the same way as you do a baconer ) , or also if you make Continental sausages . But it is better to take your pigs on to bacon weight and then get what pork you want out of them before baconing or making sausages of the rest . Pork , like all other meat except offal , should be hung in a cool draughty place for several days before either cooking , or putting in the deep freeze . 95 // But about this time it is more than possible that the Methodist parson will pay you a visit . It is remarked in America that these gentlemen are attracted by the squeaking of pigs , as the fox is by the cackling of the hen . WILLIAM COBBETT : Cottage Economy 96 8 Poultry , Sheep , Goat , Rabbit , Pigeon He who can deliberately inflict torture upon an animal .. . is an abuser of the authority which God has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heart . WILLIAM COBBETT : Cottage Economy POULTRY And that rules out , completely and absolutely , Belsen houses of whatever nature they be : battery houses or broiler houses . To confine , whom nature has given the urge to scrap , to perch , to flap her wings , to take dust baths , in a wire cage in which she can not do any of these things , is revoltingly cruel and I can not bring myself to talk to anybody who does it , nor would I , on any condition , allow such a person inside my house . Let your hens run outside , so that they can suffer , as we do , the heat of the sun and the bite of the frost . No animal was meant always to be kept at the same temperature . Let them have a house in which they can perch at night away from the foxes and the rain , although hens do very well indeed , in our climate , just perching in trees . Give each hen a handful of grain every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , and any scraps you can spare . They will eat a lot of grass and a lot of earwigs . If they want to go broody , let them go broody . They will hatch you out a clutch of pretty little chicks , which you can eat when they get less pretty , or , if pullets , introduce into your laying flock . Keep them out of your garden or they 'll play hell with it . A dozen , or a couple of dozen , hens kept like this will keep you and your family in eggs most of the year , at times you will have some to give away , at // times you may be without any but if you have plenty of bacon hung up that wo n't kill you . If you want to go in for hens in a larger way , say because you are the hen specialist in a community , or because you want to make eggs part of your export trade , then I would recommend the method used by that doyen of poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range and give them whole grain in one self-feed container and protein in another . Let them have as much of both as they can stuff , and this wo n't be much , as a matter of fact , because they will balance their own diet . If they are not on free range give them green food , household scraps and anything else they will eat . The self-feed hoppers you can make yourself by hanging oil drums down from the roof with holes knocked in the bottoms of them enough to let the birds peck out the grain . If you feed protein mash in one you should stand it in a tray , with holes knocked in the bottom of the drum so that any spillage is caught in the tray . Raise it up to keep out mice and rats . You will find by this method that you have very little work to do , and you get your eggs very economically , and your hens stay fit as well . Always keep a cock among your hens ? hens like having it off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better if they can live in their natural social groups , which in the case of chickens means a harem of hens around a cock . If you can let the hens run right out into the fields and woods so much the better . You will lose a few eggs from outlaying ? but what does it matter ? They will be getting so much . free food that that will make up for a few clutches of eggs , and surprisingly often you will see a hen , apparently long-lost , come waddling back from who-knows-where with fourteen fine little chicks at her heels . Why go in for incubators and brooders and all that nonsense when hens will do all that work for nothing for you ? And they know so much more about it than we do . If you have n't got much space you will have to have a semi-intensive method of keeping hens . The best I have ever // seen was the hennery of Lady Eve Balfour , the founder of the Soil Association . In her garden in Suffolk she kept her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a henhouse . The house was surrounded by a wire fence , and inside the wire fence much straw or other litter was put . Lady Eve claimed that each hen made , with this litter , a ton of manure a year to go on her garden . Next to the straw pen were two small pens planted with grass and clover . Lady Eve used to let the hens into one of these two pens every day for a fortnight . She would then close that pen and let the hens into the other pen for a fortnight . Thus the grass and clover got a chance to rest and recover , and you saw none of that awful scratchedearth policy that you see with most semi-intensive henneriesall dust and holes and old tin cans and bunches of nettles . The hens do all their scratching in the straw yard , for that is where you throw their grain down for them . They thus only go into the grass and clover pen to peck grass and clover . If you had three grass and clover pens I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass a longer rest , and if you rotated by grazing with ducks , geese , sheep or calves it would be excellent , for you would thus keep internal parasite infection at a minimum . All poultry need access to grit : insoluble grit such as crushed flint for use in their crops and , if they are not running on limestone or other calcareous land a calcareous grit such as crushed sea-shells . It is a good plan to throw your used egg shells in the slow oven of the stove and then every few weeks pull them out and crush them up to powder and feed-to the hens . The protein component of the mash can be a highprotein concentrate from the mill , or a mixture of , say , fish meal , meat meal , bone meal and soya bean meal in about equal proportions ( although it does n't matter ) . Boiled fish offal is excellent and if you can get plenty of it , or meat offal , this is the cheapest answer . You will get some eggs from grain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really to produce eggs they must have some protein . The eggs of England derive largely from the trawling grounds of the Atlantic Shelf . // Sally has bought hens from the Belsen houses sometimes . Hens in batteries will only live about a year ( we have had a hen laying at ten years old and laying really well ) . But before their first year is out battery hens are sick , like to die , and can not be kept alive in the wire cages any longer . They are therefore sold for scrap ' , at prices as often as low as ten new pennies . Sally has bought them thus for half a crown , brought them home in the van , and turned them loose . Always some fail to survive the journey . It takes them two or three days to learn to walk ? at first you have to carry them about . Within a week they have learned to do something they have never done before : that is scrap , or scratch about for food . Within a month they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chafed and naked necks ( they had worn the old feathers off on the wire ) , the sores and callouses on their breasts have healed , they learn to flap their wings , run , chase earwigs , and it does the heart good to see them . They will live and lay well for a couple of years sometimes but they never really recover the vigour and health of free-range-reared hens . The trouble with the modern industrial hen ( the hybrid ' ) is that she does not go broody . Broodiness has been bred out of her , not being required by the agri-businessman . So if you wish to rear your own chicks naturally you will have to get some old-fashioned hens from somewhere . Light Sussex are a very good breed , for eggs , meat and rearing chicks , but they lay white eggs . The eggs are none the worse for being white but do n't look so nice . Rhode Island Red is another fine breed , and lays brown eggs . The best thing you can get is the good-old backyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want very brown eggs shove in a Cuckoo-Marran cockerel . He will father a brown-egg-laying brood , but they are not very prolific . My advice is stay away from the flighty highlyspecialized egg-laying breeds like the modern hybrids and even the old White Leghorns . They will lay more eggs per year if highly fed and highly looked after , but they wo n't convert natural food so well , are no good for meat , and not so hardy . Also they are rotten mothers . too POULTRY Geese . The full grown goose ' , Cobbett tells us , has solidity in it . ' A pen of geese , say three geese and a gander , or two geese and a gander , or for that matter a gander and a goose , will run happily about the fields , and live on grass with just a handful of grain thrown to them every night to lure them home to shut them in from the foxes . They do n't need any grain . When they begin to lay , say in February or March , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can beg , borrow or steal broody hens from a neighbour , you can steal the goose eggs from the geese and put them under the broody hens . You will have to splash the eggs with water every day , because a hen does not know about this part of a goose mother 's duties . The hens will bring the young geese into the world , and look after them when they get there as well as the geese will . Also , by taking the eggs away from the geese you encourage your geese to lay more eggs . When you think that you are unlikely to get more than one more clutch of eggs out of your goose anyway ? let her sit on a clutch ( maybe fourteen . A hen will sit on six ) . But you must protect them from rats and foxes . Rats will pull goose eggs , or young geese , right out from under the feathers of the goose mother . A fox will go miles to get a sitting goose . When you have your baby geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their real mother the goose , feed them well at first on some meal and protein , but when they are teen-age geese they will begin to eat grass and they will live quite well on grass , and grow all summer . No goose should be eaten before Michaelmas , but it is then justifiable to celebrate with a Michaelmas goose . Straight off grass he will be green ' , he will not have solidity ' in him . He wo n't be fat . Let the others go on running out on grass , with no more than the merest handful of corn to lure them in at night , until three weeks before you want to kill them . Some people say two weeks , or even ten days , but three weeks is quite enough . Then you must pen them and give them as much barley as they can eat . If you are going to kill them , or sell them , for Christmas do n't forget they have got to hang for at least a week . Geese are very ioz POULTRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep , they never get ill , and if you do n't worry about setting their eggs under hens they are very good at hatching them out themselves , only you wo n't get so many geese . But after all , if a family eats half a dozen geese in a year it eats a lot of geese , and that is only half a clutch , so you do n't need many geese unless you want to sell them . Ducks . Ducks are not very good mothers , in the domesticated state , in fact I ca n't think of worse . They will drag their poor little chicks through the rough and the wet , lead them down to a muddy ditch , and before you know where you are they are all dead . Hens hatch ducks eggs out much better than ducks do , but if the ducks do do it then you must keep the ducks in coops , those old-fashioned hen coops where bars in front keep the mother inside while the babies can get out and run about . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducklings go near the water : they lack the oil in their feathers that a mother duck would have given them and catch cold . Young ducks , in fact , should not be let go near water at all , until they become teen-age . They need plenty of clean water to drink of course , as indeed every living thing does . Feed them much as you would chickens . When you want to eat your surplus cockerels , or ducks for that matter , it is a good idea to give them ten days fattening on barley meal mash before you kill them . Mix the mash with skimmed milk if you have it . If you do n't bother to do this they also taste very good . Turkeys . Turkeys thrive very well in the absence of hens , but if they run with hens you have got to medicinate their water or food with some stuff that protects them from blackhead , which they catch from the hens . They are tenderer as to climate than other poultry , and need shelter in bad weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . SHEEP Now we come to sheep , and must hope that these animals will not object to being thrown in with a lot of cackling poultry . zo2 SHEEP Sheep are , a very good thing to keep , for the self-supporter . For a sheep is of a size ? a fat lamb is anyway ? that makes it possible to eat him , in the winter at any rate , before the meat goes bad . If you can share your sheep between , say , four families , it means that each family gets one very good joint , either a leg or a shoulder , and a share of the ribs . Sheep live and fatten on grass . Do n't even make demands on your hay unless the ground is covered with snow ( and even then they wo n't eat hay unless they have previously learnt to ) ; they are thus cheap to keep . Ewes only have one or two lambs at a time though , unlike sows which have a dozen or more , so their rate of increase is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen ewes , and consume all or most of their progeny throughout the year . The one slight complication here is ? what about the ram ? Does it really pay to keep a ram to serve only six sheep ? An answer might be to ask a neighbouring farmer if you could borrow his ram for a few days . In a community , of course , this problem is much more easily solved as are so many other problems . If four families keep six sheep each it is quite justifiable to keep a ram for them all . If the people have any sense they will keep their respective sheep in one flock , which one person looks-after . If grass is not short with you , well keep a ram by all means , even if he is underemployed . At least he will give you wool . If you want a small sheep , and a small sheep is certainly best for the single-handed self-supporter , then I would suggest the Southdown as your best breed . She is not very prolific , which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very good and her conformation as a mutton animal unsurpassed ; she is quiet and docile . If you live in the mountains , or on very rough ground , the Welsh Mountain is another small breed and has unsurpassed mutton . But you will have to fence well because he is as wild as a stag . If he ca n't get under he will get over , and he is quite unsuitable for folding , which we shall discuss later . If you want a big sheep , and are on good land , the Suffolk or a Suffolk cross are fine . But the advice 1 03 POULTRY , SHEEP , GOAT , RABBIT , PIGEON I would be inclined to give would be ? choose the breed that is native to the country you live in . We had Suffolks while in Suffolk and Welsh in Wales but we crossed the Welsh with a Suffolk ram . As to the husbandry of sheep , if you are not doing it commercially there is really very little to be said about it at all . Sheep eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer time if they are not infected with internal parasites . Sheep men say the biggest enemy of a sheep is another sheep . The meaning of this is that sheep can not stand overstocking . Very good pasture may carry three ewes with their lambs per acre , less good two ewes and their lambs . You might average one and a half lambs per ewe . But they will do far better if you rotate them around the farm : put them on , say , a quarter of your grass acreage and keep them there until they have nibbled the grass right down , then move them on to the next quarter . In this way let them follow the cows ? sheep will graze very advantageously after cows have had all they can get : cows will starve after sheep . The obvious plan is to lamb in the spring so that the lambs grow up on clean spring grass , have the summer growing season to fatten on , and are killed in the autumn and winter , so in the late winter hungry gap ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If your acreage is too small to winter your stock of ewes you can keep them indoors , at or least allow them to come indoors part of the time . You then must feed them on hay . And perhaps give them some oats , or other corn . Watch them carefully to see what sort of condition they are in . If you have your own ram you can leave him with the ewes all the year , and leave their lambing date to them and him . If you borrow a ram try to do it so as to cause your ewes to lamb early but not too early : say about March . So put the ram in about the end of September and if you can keep him in for about six weeks . If you like put some reddle on his chest so that he marks the ewes as he serves them : then you know that they have been served and can even work out the date that they should lamb . I04 SHEEP Folding sheep in the winter on arable land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Grow swedes , or mangolds ( swedes are best ) , rape or kale . We never have done it but it does ' the land , as farmers say , i.e. , is good for it , gets the sheep off pasture giving the worms time to die out there , and rests the grass . Sheep need hay while folded thus on roots , and if you want to fatten them feed them corn too . Crushed oats and kibbled beans are very good . Give them as much as they will clear up quickly and no more ( maybe a pound a day ) . But if you are just out for simplicity , and your own good mutton when you feel like it , I would suggest just leave them out to grass . When they lamb there should be no problems , but if there are they will probably be the same sort of problems that we discussed at length when dealing with the cow . The same rules apply . If a ewe has a dead lamb and another has twins , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bereaved mother . Put the bereaved one in a small pen ( four hurdles tied together ) or a shed , rub the live lamb all over with the body of the dead lamb , and try lamb and foster mother together . If she knocks him for six take him out , skin the dead lamb and put the skin on the live lamb like a jersey . This nearly always works . After a day or two remove the skin and the adoption is permanent . You can then let them both out . If a lamb is very weakly , feed it cow 's milk with a little glucose or honey mixed with it , warmed to blood heat . Many smallholders rear orphan lambs on bottles : Sally does nearly every year . I am against it but the children love it . And it is one way of getting cheap mutton if ? and here lies the rub ? you have the heart to kill them after you have brought them up as their mother . You must feed them very often for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day after a fortnight , twice a day after a month . It is an awful labour ; they never do as well as natural sheep , they are an incredible nuisance , will follow you round baa'ing and bleating and trying to knock you over , will never , or hardly ever , join a proper flock of sheep , and if they do n't get into your garden sooner or later 105
