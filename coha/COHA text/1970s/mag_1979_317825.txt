Beyond Iran <P> To the Editors : <P> In your article on the Crescent of Crisis Jan. 15 you quote Zbigniew Brzezinski as saying , " I 'd have to be blind or Pollyannish not to recognize that there are dark clouds on the horizon . " On the horizon . " It is clear that those clouds are already formed-right over our heads . To say otherwise is at best Pollyannish , and at worst irresponsibly myopic . <P> Paul L. Gomory Jr . <P> San Francisco <P> Objectivity would require the addition of the American eagle looking from the west with a gaze as interested and predatory as that of the Russian bear . <P> Bruce Arnold <P> Princeton , N.J. <P> Can the U.S. continue to count its foreign friends only among the handful of titular heads or figureheads of state who appear to oppose abroad the principles we espouse at home ? Many conflicts could be shortened , and many friendly leaders saved from grief , if the U.S. would preempt Soviet or Cuban support of popular movements , instead of being cornered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Kissinger says about Iran : " The remedial measures that are needed in this crisis should receive bipartisan support . There will be opportunities later to discuss what went wrong . " This reasoning led to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution . Thanks for the reminder , Henry . <P> Joseph Manganello <P> Westville , N.J. <P> Carter from a Distance <P> You quote Seymour Martin Lipset as saying , " Carter is in the same boat as Nixon , looking good abroad while facing a sea of domestic troubles " Jan. 1 . Of course Carter faces a sea of domestic troubles , but he does not look good abroad , certainly not in Europe . Americans can play it down or explain it away , but they should not ignore it . <P> Peter Sypcher <P> Wallisellen , Switzerland <P> TIME seems convinced that Carter has put his presidency on the line with regard to his Middle East peace efforts . Bull-feathers ! Even the majority of his critics would acknowledge that whatever takes place between Egypt and Israel , Carter 's effort to conclude a peace was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning is n't necessarily everything ; Americans still respect good causes , lost or otherwise . <P> John Rachal <P> Oxford , N.C. <P> Your article on foreigners buying land Jan. 8 states that " the only U.S. tax that a nonresident alien owner escapes is on capital gains if he sells his land . " This does n't tell the whole story . Nonresident aliens also pay less estate tax to the U.S. For example , in 1979 , on a taxable estate of $500,000 , the U.S. citizen or resident pays estate tax of $117,800 ; the nonresident alien pays only $50,400 . This is outrageous . U.S. tax law should not discriminate in favor of the foreign investor . <P> Bob Packwood <P> U.S. Senator , Oregon
