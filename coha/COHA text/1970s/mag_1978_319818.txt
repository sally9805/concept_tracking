After eleven years as a missile engineer on the Minuteman test program at Cape Kennedy , Carl Eichhorn was ordered by his employer TRW to go to California to work on a new project . " It was go or else , " he recalls . He refused . <P> After working his way up to a senior vice presidency at an Interpublic advertising branch in Atlanta , Charles Sherry was told that the office was being closed down . But he was not to worry ; a job was waiting for him in Manhattan . No thanks , said Sherry . <P> The cases are by no means atypical . <P> More and more executives and their families are refusing to be uprooted , even if the transfer means higher rank and salary . Merrill Lynch Relocation Management , Inc. , which specializes in moving executives , estimates that 200,000 to 300,000 of them will be asked by their employers this year to move to new locations and one-third to one-half will object ; only a decade ago , the refusal rate was no more than 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp. : " The balance has definitely shifted away from saluting the company and marching off to Timbuctu toward a greater emphasis on family and life-style . " <P> The change represents a fundamental shift in American values . Many executives , especially those in their 40s and 50s , still march to the company drum and accept transfers as a means of rising . But younger executives-and their spouses - are revolting against the stress and insecurity of the mobile society . Their rejection of the onward and upward American work ethic echoes Pop Star Billy Joel 's hit : " If that 's movin ' up/ Then I 'm movin ' out . " Or , as TRW Vice President James Dunlap says , " There 's a feeling that work is n't everything these days . You 've got to stop and smell the flowers along the way . " <P> American executives are becoming increasingly interested in things money can not buy , notably a stable home life , a safe environment , a wholesome community , sun , fun and culture . For example , Mark Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down three transfers in order to raise his three children in one place . But Burns is aware that his refusals limited his possibilities at IBM , whose initials , many employees joke , stand for I 've Been Moved . Hence , Burns came to the conclusion he must switch careers and now is president of a small bank on Chicago 's South Side . <P> Roughly 40% of all American women now hold jobs , a substantial change in the past two decades . Naturally , a two-paycheck family faces more complications in moving , especially if one spouse 's raise might be offset by the other taking a cut . When an electronics executive was asked to shift from Boston to Maine , his wife , a nurse , could find nothing to match her present job . Their decision : to remain in Boston . Having diligently worked up to assistant vice president at Bank of America 's home office in San Francisco , Richard Easley , 33 , was offered a reward : the No. 2 spot in a big Bank of America branch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unwilling to relocate his family , Easley simply decided that he did not , under those conditions , desire the promotion .
