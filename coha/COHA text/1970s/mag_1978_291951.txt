Man of the Year <P> To the Editors : <P> You made an excellent choice in selecting Anwar Sadat as the Man of the Year Jan. 2 , but you really did not select him-by his bold deeds he selected himself . <P> ( The Rt . Rev. ) Thomas J. Havlik <P> Abbot , St. Procopius Abbey <P> Lisle , Ill . <P> An obvious choice . But how long has it been since your selection was so easy ? <P> George Schmitz Los Angeles <P> Man of the Year-rubbish . Sadat betrayed the goals and aspirations of the Arab people . Who else has sold his dignity and that of his people so cheaply ? <P> Veronica-Gillian Pugh New York City <P> A poor choice . Because of the economic condition of his country , and for only this reason , Sadat decided to open up diplomatic relations with Israel and search for peace . The man 's back is against the wall . <P> Michael Kanter Chicago <P> I have no quarrel with Anwar Sadat as Man of the Year . But to state that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1973 is the most convoluted type of logic I 've come across in a long , long time . To add insult to injury , you go on to say that after the Egyptian army " had taken a battering from the Israelis , " Sadat " accepted " a ceasefire . Whose leg are you trying to pull ? <P> Pearl Furman San Francisco <P> Although I applaud TIME 'S Man of the Year , I am sorry and disappointed that he is not sharing the honor with Menachem Begin . Much like a tree falling in a forest , without anyone to hear , the sounds of peace would not have been heard . <P> Constance C. Holden Brewer , Me . <P> <P> Moods in the Nation <P> In your article " New Year 's Mellow Mood " Jan. 2 , Student Eric Mowrey is quoted as describing the prevailing national mood as a " beneficial apathy of satisfaction . " It could be more accurately characterized as one of reckless complacence . As we " go forth and party without feeling a sense of remorse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter our concept of energy and environmental coexistence , this may well be our last party . <P> John T. Stigner <P> Citizens for Environmental Responsibility <P> Phoenix <P> Existing in an age when it is hard to be much of anything without money-including mellow-I think the outburst of optimism you so vividly express is a bit off target . Sure , everyone enjoys seeing a movie where the good guys defeat the bad guys . But when it costs $3.50 to $4 to witness such an event , some of the excitement vanishes . As I look toward 1978 , I still see the black hat of inflation prevailing in America , making my mood somewhat " mellow yellow . " <P> Marijane Engel Denver <P> As Perfect As Possible <P> I enjoyed Stefan Kanfer 's Essay on the state of the English language Jan. 2 . It might interest you to know that Brown University 's instructions to doctoral candidates told them to make their dissertations " as perfect as possible . " I did . <P> Eric L. Hinderliter Providence <P> While in Plattsburgh , N.Y. , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Steak with Smothered Onions . " I asked the waitress whether they smothered their onions with a pillow or a crumpled sheet . She did not understand my confusion . <P> James Kuzmak New City , N. Y.
