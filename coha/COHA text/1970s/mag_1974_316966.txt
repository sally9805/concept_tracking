In Michigan last week , Governor William Milliken was suggesting a more pointed alternative to President Ford 's WIN button campaign . His version : BAC , for " Buy a Car . " In a juxtaposition of imperatives that verged on contradiction , some Chrysler dealers were distributing bumper stickers proclaiming : WHIP INFLATION NOW . BUY A CAR . Top auto industry executives were pitching in with efforts of their own . Chrysler Chairman Lynn Townsend declared " a new car is the best buy you can get in America today . " Outgoing General Motors Chairman Richard Gerstenberg , in a signed newspaper advertisement , once again made clear that what was good for GM was good for the country . " When you buy a new car , " he said , " you help America 's economy . " Even the United Auto Workers chimed in with plans for an ad campaign to stimulate sales . <P> It all seemed reminiscent of the " You Auto Buy Now " blitz of the late 1950s . The U.S. auto industry is in its worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phalanx of woes ranging from high gasoline prices to plunging consumer confidence and virulent inflation that has driven car prices to record levels , sales for U.S. models in early November were running at a paltry annual pace of 5.4 million . That was sharply below the 7.5 million rate for October and nowhere near the record 11.5 million in sales last year . <P> While U.S. dealers expect to sell around 9 million cars by the end of this year , the performance will be a 23% drop from 1973-the largest annual percentage erosion in any year since 1958 . For 1975 , the outlook is no brighter . Already , auto layoffs are mounting . They stood at nearly 200,000 last week and could soon reach a frightening 225,000 - about 16% of the industry 's work force - if the slump is not reversed . <P> Really Sloppy . The hardest hit is Chrysler . With a third-quarter loss of $8 million and early November sales down 41% from a year ago , the third largest automaker will shut down all but one of its six U.S. car-assembly plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanksgiving until Jan. 6 . Only its plant in St. Louis will produce cars . The move , which came as no surprise in view of Chrysler 's 120-day inventory of unsold cars , means layoffs and bleak Christmases for 64,200 workers . White-collar workers also face the ax ; fully 20,000 will be temporarily dropped at Chrysler . All company officers , from the vice-presidential level up to and including Chairman Townsend , will take December pay cuts . An angry Douglas Fraser , chief of the U.A.W. 's Chrysler Department , blamed the company for " irresponsible " overproduction , noting that the company in September and October built cars at a rate of 136% of sales . " That 's really sloppy management , " he said .
