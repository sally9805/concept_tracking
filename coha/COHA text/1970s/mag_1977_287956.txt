A promise of neither a witch hunt nor a whitewash <P> Without even a building to call its own , ; he Comptroller of the Currency 's office is a federal backwater , responsible only for the important but dull job of regulating the 4,600 national banks . Suddenly , the comptroller 's quarters at the L'Enfant Plaza hotel are among the busiest in Washington , as U.S. bank examiners press their potentially explosive investigation of Bert Lance 's financial affairs . The comptroller 's lengthy report is due soon , perhaps this week , and could save or squash the powerful budget director , who is Jimmy Carter 's old pal , former creditor and longtime close confidant . Says Deputy Comptroller C. Westbrook Murphy : " All we 're dealing with is the survival of Bert Lance and the reputation of the President , not to mention the performance of some of the biggest banks in the world . " <P> Couriers hustle to the comptroller 's office with confidential records shipped from the banks that figure in the investigation , notably Chicago 's First National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bank of Georgia . Some 30 bank examiners and half a dozen lawyers so far have pored over more than 5,000 pages of documents . At night , guards patrol the offices to prevent any theft or tampering with evidence . Some portions of the report were being written last week , but the bulk of the investigation was still being pursued , under the direction of John G. Heimann , 48 , the deceptively youthful comptroller . <P> Heimann began the probe the day after he was sworn into office on July 21 . A smart and ambitious moderate Democrat , he has firsthand knowledge of the highflying financial world in which Lance made his fortune . An economics graduate of Syracuse University ( ' 50 ) , Heimann started with the Wall Street investment house of Smith , Barney &; Co. , promising to quit in two years if he could not create new business in the virgin field of advising labor unions on investing pension funds . " Nothing happened for a year and three-quarters , " he recalled . " I worked terribly hard , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Television and Radio Artists came in , and after that the business built very rapidly . " Heimann became known as one of Wall Street 's brightest young comers and began earning enough to support his wife and two children in lavish style on Manhattan 's East Side . <P> In 1975 New York Governor Hugh Carey , a friend , recruited him as the state 's superintendent of banks , at a big pay cut ( to $47,800 a year ) . Last year he moved on to become New York commissioner of housing and community renewal and straightened out the state 's nearly bankrupt programs in those areas . Heimann was an early backer of Jimmy Carter . Soon after beginning the investigation of Lance 's finances , Heimann ordered his top staff to conduct " neither a whitewash nor a witch hunt .
