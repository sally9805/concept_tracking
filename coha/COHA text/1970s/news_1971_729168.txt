txt Maybe you like the looks of that snappy yellow Chevelle Malibu on the showroom floor . You notice it has those comfortable " extras " such as air conditioning and power steering that you 've been wanting . It 's the sight of that sticker in the left rear window , listing the price at $4,128 , that has you stopped . Within minutes , however , an emphatic salesman whittles the figure to $3,675 . He is quite prepared to go lower when you tell him about the competition you 've seen . Most car dealers and manufacturers view this daily bargaining exercise as free enterprise in action . The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) is not quite so sure . The five commissioners charged with policing unfair trade practices are concerned that not all consumers may realize that the window sticker price ? the manufacturer 's suggested retail price ? is rarely the price they have to pay . Other reductions offered Discounts of 17 to 21 percent , sometimes more , are common . In making the rounds of a half dozen dealerships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on showroom models , this reporter was offered the Malibu mentioned above , a Mercury Comet listing at $2,800 for $2,600 , and a Plymouth Satellite quoted at $3,201 for $2,795 . Only on imports such as Mercury 's Capri and the Volkswagen was she assured no discount was possible , The FTC contends that many consumers are thoroughly confused about new car pricing practices . And it reasons that even the most sophisticated may lack the bargaining ability to net themselves a fair deal . // By Peter W. Main , Photo staff Just a gimmick ? Many automobile buyers complain that window-sticker prices are misleading . New car dealers disagree . *FTC asks : Do car stickers help buyers get stuck ? // The commission is supported in its concern by a stack of consumer letters in its public files . A Brooklyn attorney describes sticker prices as an " unrealistic gimmick " while a New Jersey housewife pleads : " Why ca n't we know in black and white the prevailing price for a car ? " A man from Denver complains that when he followed up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , he found the price only applied to a car without options . The perplexing problem for the FTC , which has just completed its second set of hearings on auto pricing , is what to do to improve the situation . The commissioners must walk a fine line between demanding enough truth-in-pricing to protect the consumer and allowing enough leeway to business to keep competition alive . Five proposals In an effort to strike this balance , the FTC has proposed five regulations for the new car industry . The most controversial of these ? so-called Rule 3 ? would clamp down on fictitiously high suggested retail prices by requiring that they not be more than 3 percent higher than the lowest price at which sales are made within the highest 30 percent range of sales . The rules also would bar price comparisons between models in which the same accessories are optional in one car and standard in another unless those facts are spelled out clearly . The industry also would be barred from advertising a price which implies that certain optional items shown or described are included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also no price reduction claims could be made unless the manufacturer reduces the wholesale price of the car to the dealer by an equal dollar amount More curbs fought Business rarely welcomes increasea iovernment regulation . Spokesmen for the new-car industry made it plain at the FTC hearings that they are no exceptior Particularly nettling to them is the proposed Rule 3 . They say that in effect it sets a price for them and could prove more confusing to consumers than the present sticker system which dates back to the 1958 Automobile Information Disclosure Act . The proposal is " administratively unworkable , " charged John J Nevin , vice-president of Ford Motor Company 's marketing division . Shoppers might be ieluded into thinking the reduced price was the " right " price , he said . Mr. Nevin said he thought the FTC had shown an " inadequate understanding " of the range of prices existing in the automobile market and the causes of it Wide price range The Ford official pointed out that m a survey of 120 dealerships last April , the Ford Galaxy was being sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of $3,462 . Even within Los Angeles , the variation was as much as $419 . Asked by the FTC what the manufacturer 's suggested retail price was on that particular model , he replied that it was S4,100 In general , dealers and manufacturers painted a picture of their business as one of low profits and high competition . Stressing that 27,000 dealers nationally are vying to sell more than 8 million cars a year , Mr. Nevin said that dealer-accounted profits are less than 2 percent of sales . Witnesses stressed the unique character of the retail car-sales business , arguing that few other areas of sales deal so heavily in trade-ins or are required to staff service divisions and make good on warranties sold by other dealers . Bargaining argued As for consumers , it was commonly argued by business representatives that all but a very few know that the sticker price is a price to bargain from . The fact that dealers profits are low and that the majority of consumers buy cars at discounts support that reasoning . spokesmen contended . A few did confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive committee of the independent Dodge-Chrysler Dealers Association and a car dealer for 23 years , conceded he did not always approve of the way consumers are told of price increases . In 1970 , for instance , when Chrysler cut Dodge dealer discounts on compacts , it made the price increase appear less striking on the window sticker tally by making standard equipment optional and by excluding the usual dealer preparation charge . " All this is nothing more than a device to raise the price of the new car without reflecting it on the price sticker , " said Mr. Cohen , proving that manufacturers and dealers have their differences of opinion , too . In general , business spokesmen argued the FTC would do well to focus its efforts on honesty in advertising in this field and on rewording the window sticker in new cars to warn consumers that the price listed is not necessarily the " real " price .
