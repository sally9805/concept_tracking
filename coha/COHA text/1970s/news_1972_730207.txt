txt A study of the first one-third of the delegates chosen for the Democratic National Convention shows that the proportion of women is running at three times the level set in 1968 , that the proportion of blacks is nearly double and that of other minorities is higher . But the study also indicates that the convention 's make-up as a whole will fall short of the reform guidelines established by the party . These data emerge from a New York Times computer analysis of the first 1,034 delegates selected in 21 states and the District of Columbia . There will be 3,016 delegates at Miami Beach when the convention opens July 10 . The survey documents earlier indications that the group will be unlike any before , with more blacks , women , youth and Chicanos . But it also shows that the delegate selections are falling below the guidelines , which require that groups be represented in rough proportion to their share of the population . The guidelines were framed by a commission headed during its most active period by Senator George . Following are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,034 , delegates , 358 , or 34.6 per cent , are women ? almost three Utiles the total Sin 1968 , when 13 Ter cent of the delegates were women , Roughly 51 per cent of the total population is female , according to the Census Bureau . The National Women 's Political Caucus has filed challenges in some states where the percentage is unusually low . 41139 of the 1,034 , or 13.4 per cent are black  --  more than double the 1968 total of about 5 per cent . According to data assembled by the . Joint Center for Political Studies , 9,2 per cent of the national voting-age population is black , so in this category the guidelines are being exceeded . But , the Congressional Black Caucus has asked that 20 per ' cent of the delegates be black , on the assumption that blacks provide that percentage of the Democrats ' vote . There are nine Chicanos , three Puerto Ricans and four American Indians among the delegates , 41123 of the 1,034 , or .11.9 ? per cent , identified themselves as members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Hubert H. Humphrey . National union leaders have predicted that they will have between 350 ' and 500 delegates . If their present pace continues , they will meet their goal with about 370. 11239 of the 1,034 , or 23.1 per cent , . are 30 years of , age or ' under . Of the voting-age population nationally , about 31 per cene are between the ages of 18 , and ? 30 , No exact figure is available for youth representation in 1968 , but in a number of state delegations , no one was under 30 years old , ? liOnly 111 of the 1,034 , or 10.74 per cent , attended the 1966 convention , and of those , many are members of the Chicago organization of Mayor Richard J. Daley . Without the 22 Daley stalwarts who served as delegates four years'ago , the percentage of veterans would dwindle to 8.6 . In ' any event , the number of repeaters ? is astonishingly small and bodes ill for those ' who are relying on old alliances . Willy 357 of the 1,034 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any party or governmental office or formerly held one . Again , the Daley contingent inflates the figure , but it is still far below past years . Minnesota 's is the best balanced delegation , with 49 per cent women , 20 per cent youth , ' 19.6 per cent black ( though the state is only 3 per cent black ) and two Indians and one Chicano . Arizona is the best on youth . Illinois , over all , is the worst again reflecting the Daley influence . The Mayor 's slates are currently being challenged before a hearing examiner because , among other things , they fall so far short of the guidelines in almost every category . The backers of Mr.  --  the front-runner and the man most responsible for the reform ? rules  --  come closest to meeting the guidelines . For example , he has 111 young people to 25 for Mr. . Humphrey and 147 women to ( 153 for Mr. Humphrey . The Minnesotan has proportionately the most blacks , however , reflecting his electoral strength in black neighborhoods , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates , but Mr. Humphrey 's total is smaller , so his black share is larger . Gov , George C. Wallace of Alabama has only 10 black delegates pledged to him in the states covered by the preliminary computer analysis .
