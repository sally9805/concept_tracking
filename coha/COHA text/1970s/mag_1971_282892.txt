The reason : a variety of fund-raising gimmicks . McGovern has used direct-mail solicitations overseen by Morris Dees ( a Montgomery-based wizard who made his millions in the mail-order business ) . There have been conventional fund-raising luncheons like one in New York City last week , where 1,350 " Business and Professional Men and Women for McGovern " laid down $25 apiece to dine on chicken and mushrooms .
