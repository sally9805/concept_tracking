A LOST LADY by WILLA CATHER 177 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> Willa Cather was born 100 years ago . This novel , reissued in a handsome centenary edition , first appeared in 1923 when the author was 50 and doing her best work . H.L. Mencken had called her a great novelist . Edmund Wilson , a young whippersnapper in those days , conceded that she was one of the few who could bring " distinction " to the Middle West : " that meager and sprawling scene . " Not even he was aware that at that very moment the post-World War I generation-Dos Passos , Fitzgerald , Hemingway , Faulkner-were sealing the door on Cather 's kind of reverent regionalism . <P> Today , like Ellen Glasgow and Sherwood Anderson , Cather has her own persistent following . In addition , students are still required to read the chaste historical novels Death Comes for the Archbishop and Shadows on the Rock in high school English classes . Many sound things can be learned from Cather . Her writing was almost always serene and poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught-of making her prose move as fast as the action she was describing . <P> When Willa was eight , her family moved from Virginia to Nebraska . She considered those early years in the newly settled state the most important of her life . In 1880 , Nebraska was still a pioneer society . Most people lived in sod houses . So many settlers from Scandinavia and Bohemia were arriving that Willa could go for days without hearing English spoken outside her house . She was wildly excited . To her , the prairie grass looked as if it were running ; it seemed possible to hear the corn growing in the summer night . In the next eleven years , the frontier was to vanish . " The great-hearted adventurers " who opened the West were replaced by men " trained in petty economies . " When Cather began to write , it was already with powerful nostalgia . <P> Spirit of Freedom . A Lost Lady is typical of the kind of prairie pastoral Cather did best . Through the eyes of a boy named Neil Herbert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tied to the railroads . Their house outside Sweetwater-one of the many fictional names Cather gave to her own town of Red Cloud-is known " from Omaha to Denver for its hospitality and for a certain charm of atmosphere . " Neil is enchanted by young Marian Forrester . She wears the only earrings he has ever seen , allows herself a little wit and more than a little sherry . <P> Her much older husband says little but his manners are impeccable , as are his dealings with the men he employs . When he dies after a hard illness , his wife coarsens and compromises herself . Her house is now the gathering spot for a group of sharp young traders , part of a new generation " who had never dared anything , never risked anything , and who would root out the great brooding spirit of freedom . " <P> They desert her when she is aging and broke . That should probably be the end of the tale , but a coda finds Marian dying comfortably in Buenos Aires as the wife of a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing that makes it hard , in the end , to take Cather seriously . Almost all her books drag on beyond their natural terminus , sometimes with two or three more stops . There is always some sentimental beneficence still to be dispensed , or worse , a moral toll to be exacted .
