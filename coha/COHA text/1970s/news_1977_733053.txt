txt As the Carter energy program unfolds after being sent to Congress today , no one will be watching the program 's impact with more Interest than the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Along with economists in the U S and elsewhere , members of the oil cartel are naturally wondering how effective the program will be in curtailing energy consumption in the U S the major market for OPEC oil But they are also anxious to see the shorter-term effects of the Carter oil-pricing proposals , which will tie domestic oil prices closer than ever to the world market The U S program , which purportedly would double the price of some so-called old oil within 30 days of enactment by Congress , is bound to influence events in the OPEC pricing war that began in December , when Saudi Arabia raised prices 5 ' ? while 11 of its 12 OPEC partners imposed a 10% increase The pricing war has taken some new turns lately and the two-tier system that resulted from the OPEC split is splintering into a multi-tiered system A Hotter Price War The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling about 2r7c above the prices charged by the OPEC majority at the start of 1977 Meantime , the pricing war among Persian Gulf nations that produce heavier and higher-sulphur crudes is heating up , partly because Saudia Arabia 's drive to expand production has taken hold All this is prompting new moves by OPEC members Venezuela and Kuwait to promote a compromise on pricing But few observers expect an official compromise to be reached before Saudi Arabia has proved to the cartel that it can hold down world oil prices by all-out production  --  or at least not before the kingdom 's crown prince , Amir Fand , meets with President Carter in late May Some observers suggest that if the dispute is n't resolved by midyear , when the cartel 's higher-priced group is due to increase prices by another 5,7c , a solution possibly wo n't be reached this year One who holds this theory is Mana Said Oteiba , the oil minister for the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia 's only supporter in the bid to hold the 1977 OPEC price increase to 5% Mr Oteiba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-tier pricing system is possible for OPEC But neither he nor any knowledgeable observer of OPEC expects the cartel to break up because of the pricing differences " I can not see a world without OPEC now , " Mr Oteiba said Effect of Price Differences There is already considerable grousing , however , about inequities arising from the cartel 's pricing differences Other oil companies contend , for example , that Exxon , Texaco , Mobil and Standard 011 of California now hold a competitive edge in the oil marketplace because of their access to Saudi crude through their interests in Arabian American Oil Co , or Aramco International oil companies such as Gulf Oil , British Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell are locked into high-volume purchase contracts with Iran , Kuwait and other higher-priced producers These companies have indicated their profits will be affected by the disparity in pricing That disparity would be widened further by the scheduled July 1 increase of 5% Meanwhile , because of the uncertainties , purchasing executives in the major oil companies say they are ordering oil on a cargobycargo basis rather than placing orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absorbing the shock , and the average consumer does n't see these huge price differentials , " says C S Nicandros , a Continental Oil executive vice president . " The ( oil ) market , " he adds . " is confused but not chaotic " Saudi Arabia 's Output The confusion started when Saudi Arabia held out for the 5% price increase at the December meeting of OPEC . At the time , Saudi Arabia pledged to expand its oil output to bring down the larger increases of the cartel 's majority . Subsequently , the Saudi government allowed Aramco , which accounts for most of its huge oil output , to produce at any rate necessary to meet demand for its cheaper crude . Orders for the Saudi oil poured in , and it was generally expected that the kingdom would be able to bring Iran and other pricing opponents quickly into line . Indeed , several Persian Gulf countries , including Iran and Kuwait , earlier this year were forced to cut production sharply because of slack demand , and Saudi Arabia continues to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-tier pricing system has continued , partly because of Saudi Arabia 's worries about possibly going too far in antagonizing its chief OPEC rival , Iran . Extremely cold weather in the U.S. during the winter complicated the picture by boosting demand for oil to record levels . Storms in the Persian Gulf early this year also restricted loadings of Saudi oil , causing some prospective purchasers to buy the higher-priced Iranian crude instead . The exceptionally high U.S. demand for oil in the first quarter , exceeding 20 million barrels a day in some cases , and Aramco 's lag in cranking up production caused oil output in Iran and Kuwait to rebound in February and March . In Iraq , another target of Saudi Arabia in the pricing war , oil purchasers are said to have been given special credit terms to help keep the oil moving Among the biggest beneficiaries of these developments , however , have been Algeria , Libya and Nigeria  --  which constitute the new , third pricing tier . These African nations not only are closer to European and S markets than the Persian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are low in sulphur Many S petroleum refiners wren t equipped to process the heavier , high-sulphur petroleum of the Mideast As U S oil imports have climbed to as high as 10 million barrels a day recently . the African crudes have been selling at a premium Algeria has Just postponed a further price increase it planned for the second quarter but Nigeria has gune ahead with an increase of about 36 cents a barrel All told the African crudes are about 12 ' ' , more expensive today than they were last December Most observers suggest that if any OPEC crudes are increased a further 5 ' ? on July 1 the African crudes will be among them There is growing doubt that the Persian Gulf producers could make the July 1 increase stick unless they are Joined by Saudi Arabia World demand for oil is coming down from the peak of the first quarter and production in Iran and Kuwait could quickly reflect the drop Production in Saudi Arabia is increasing at a steady clip now Perhaps because of the sensitivity of the topic within OPEC . Aramco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating statistics But Abdul Aziz Al-Turki . Saudi Arabia 's deputy oil minister , says Aramco 's oil exports for March averaged 9 3 million barrels a day , an increase of some 540,000 barrels a day from the February level Since Aramco also produces at least 400,000 barrels of oil a day that is processed into products at its refinery in Saudi Arabia , it would appear that March production for the company averaged at least a record 9 7 million barrels a day Other companies produce some 170.000 barrels a day in the Neutral Zone that Saudi Arabia shares with Kuwait Thus . Saudi production in March was near its targeted 10 million barrels a day And sources say output in April is exceeding the March level If the Carter energy program should achieve the goal of trimming of oil consumption and imports , it would be in line with Saudi Arabia 's stated hopes The kingdom has long maintained that the U S and other Western nations are using too much oil and that it ca n't go on forever producing oil far beyond its own revenue needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase taxes on oil produced in the U S and thus push its price up to world levels might work in favor of the higherpriced group in OPEC by providing a higher pricing floor for OPEC 's best customer .
