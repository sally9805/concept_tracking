THE ULTRA SECRET by F.W. WINTERBOTHAM 199 pages . Harper &; Row . $8.95 . <P> <P> What if ? is history 's forever teasing and unanswerable question . What if Marshal Ney 's troops had not sat eating lunch before Waterloo while the Duke of Wellington retreated to safety ? Etcetera . To all such historic posers must now be added questions raised by a retired British group captain named Frederick Winterbotham . What if a Pole working in a German factory had not defected to the Allies in 1938 , bringing with him the first construction details of the Nazis ' coding machine , called Enigma ? And what if British cryptographers had not eventually cracked Enigma 's supposedly unbreakable coding system , which throughout World War II was to carry all the German high command 's secret wireless traffic ? Would Britain have fallen ? Would the Allies have lost the war ? <P> After 35 years of officially imposed silence , Winterbotham reveals in The Ultra Secret that British intelligence did crack the code . From 1939 onward Churchill and later Roosevelt , Eisenhower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . The whole system of deciphering Enigma 's signals and relaying the intelligence was called the Ultra Operation . It sometimes produced translated copies of Hitler 's orders to his generals within an hour of their original transmission . Little wonder that Churchill once called Ultra " my most secret weapon . " <P> Terrible Decision . This is not a book on code breaking . Winterbotham passes over the mechanics of Enigma to deal with the Allied use of its output . Dissemination of Ultra intelligence had to be limited to only a few senior commanders , lest the Germans ( and later the Japanese , who also used Enigma machines ) should discover the awful truth . <P> <P> No Ultra intercepts could be retransmitted . Allied field commanders had to mask privileged Ultra knowledge with conventional intelligence gathering ( like air reconnaissance ) to keep the enemy from suspecting odd coincidences . In 1943 , when American pilots , armed with precise information from Ultra , shot down the Japanese navy 's Pacific chief , Admiral Yamamoto , over the island of Bougainville , London protested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately the Japanese were too shocked to notice . <P> The overriding military necessity of preserving Ultra 's secrecy sometimes led to Allied tragedy . On Nov. 14 , 1940 , for instance , Ultra picked up German bombing orders for a blitz of the cathedral city of Coventry , well before the attack was due . Winterbotham relayed word to Churchill , who then faced a " terrible decision " : whether or not to evacuate Coventry and almost certainly give Ultra 's secret to the Germans . Churchill 's choice doomed a city .
