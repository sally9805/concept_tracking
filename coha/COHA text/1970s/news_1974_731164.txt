txt Imagine a square chip of mirrorlike material called silicon , paper-thin and half the nail 's size but jammed with miniaturized electronic circuitry that can do the work of more than 7.000 transistors . What you have is the brain of America 's newest consumer sensation  --  the pocket calculator . It 's a tiny brain whose complex functions require 35 times the transistor circuitry of an average color television set . Operating silently in thousandths of a second , the minicalculators are the modern state-of-theart answer to the eternal desire to tally things up . Dubbed the newest adult toy , they 're being sold everywhere , from office supply centers to drug stores . Roger Sordelet , an executive at Consolidated Office Machines &; Equipment Co. , a retailer , said many gift-shoppers who would have bought typewriters a . year or two ago bought pocket calculators last Christmas . USING THE CALCULATORS , supermarket shoppers are bringing space-age technology to the art of comparing values , accountants and salesmen are getting more of their paperwork done on planes , travelers are translating those " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and waiters are finding it easier to split the tab for Dutch-treat diners . Andrew Jakes , a senior security analyst at Continental Illinois National Bank &; Trust Co. , There is more to news than what happened yesterday . There are trends to spot , interesting people to meet , fresh ideas to explore , new issues to explain . That 's what our new Column 1 feature will do . You 'll find it right here each Monday , Wednesday , and Friday . We invite your comments . bought a calculator to replace the slide rule he used to take with him on out-of-town financial inspection visits . Chicago attorney Jon Ekdahl , who said buying a calculator is like buying a stereo ? " there are zillions of models " ? plans to get a lot of use from his machine on tax matters . Another recent calculator purchaser , magazine writer Marcia Opp , said she no longer lets her checkbook go unbalanced for months . A FEW COLLEGES have limited the use of calculators during . examinations . They reason that they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford them . But not all educators agree . Norman H. Nachtrieb , a chemistry professor and assistant dean at the University of Chicago , said a good ' educator emphasizes the principle of how to solve a problem , not just speed in getting the solution . The Berkeley Cal . Board of Education has approved an experimental program to provide calculators for junior high school students having trouble with the mechanics of mathematics . John Kelley , a professor of mathematics at the University of California who devised the National Science Foundation-funded program , said the students will still have to master the concepts of math . Those receiving the calculators are untrainably " clumsy and inefficient " in performing basics like multiplication and division even if they know what they 're supposed to do , he said . " It 's like giving glasses to a kid with bad eyes , " he said . The students will keep the calculators after they graduate . Altho pocket calculators are priced from $29.95 to $795 , the most popular ones are in the $50 to $100 price range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a plastic case roughly 5 inches long , 3 inches wide , and 11/2 inches thick . Some use replaceable " penlight " batteries , while others have rechargeable batteries and can also operate on regular current . The superthin Sinclair Executive uses hearing aid type batteries and is only three-eighths of an inch thick ? making it one pocket calculator that really will fit into a pocket easlly . The history of pocket calculators has been one of rapidly falling , prices ? a trend that has contributed to their mass popularity ? reminiscent of the transistor radio craze . Pushing the price down have been mass production , improved technologies , and the often intense competition among manufacturers and retailers . BOWMAR INSTRUMENTS CORP . introduced one of the first pocket calculators in late 1971 at $240 , but by 1972 the same unit was selling for $179 and soon after that dropped to $149 . A new model with essentially the same features cost $120 early in 1973 , but later in the year a comparable model sold for:about $80 . Now Bowmar has introduced a $49.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price news last summer with a $31.95 calculator , but just before last Christmas , National Semiconductor Corp . broke another barrier a $29.95 unit . Some industry officials now talk of a simple $19.95 calculator that could become an everyday household item . " This market can move so fast in models ano p*.wes that unless you watch 3-ourself , you can end up selling some of these things at a loss ? which we sometimes have to do , " said , one dealer . The lowest cost units , however , are sometimes made in limited quantities , and their smaller profit margins , reportedly are not attractive to dealers . Many buyers also find the capabilities of the least expensive models too limited . Every pocket calculator has three key parts : ? A keyboard resembling ' a Touch - Tone phone , upon which calculations are entered . ? A lighted display panel with neon-sign-like numerals to read out calculations in progress and the final answer . The most common panel uses very small , inexpensive light - emitting diodes  --  a manmade material that glows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chip metal oxide semiconductor/large scale integration ) that provides the intelligence and programming for the unit . The MOS/LSI chip is a result of the invention in 1958 of the integrated circuit by a Texas Instruments employe and University of Illinois graduate , Jack Kilby , who was 35 . INTEGRATED CIRCUIT technology allows minute and intricate electronic circuits to be inscribed on a tiny chip of material such as silicon thru chemical and photographic means . The chip can then take the place of thousands of individual transistors and other components . The first integrated circuits were used in the Minuteman missile program and later found their way into all manner of electronic uses from television sets to hearing aids to industrial processing equipment . The recently developed pocket calculator chip compresses what would be a bucketful of transistors , each the size of a pencil eraser , into a single ' electronic component so light it can be blown away by a breeze . . A commonly used pocket calculator chip now sells ? for about $5 to $8 . The more complex the calculator , the more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four basics of addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division . ALL BUT THE LEAST expensive models can handle entries of at least eight digits , and usually also have a floating decimal the decimal point in the final total is correctly positioned automatically and a constant key to allow easier multiple calculations where one entry remains the same . Additional features vary widely and some units may have a special button for easier figuring of percentages or a simple memory capability to allow the user to store a figure for later use in a continuing calculation . At the top of the line are the electronic slide rules that can calculate sines , exponentials , reciprocals , and numbers to any power . Many of these are available in the $100 to $200 range . Hewlett-Packard offers a $395 model aimed at financial executives that includes a 200-year electronic calendar . The firm has also announced a supersophisticated $795 , scientific pocket calculator that can be programmed in a manner similar to that of a computer . The 11-ounce unit uses several chips for the equivalency of 75,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to a small amount of labor required in their construction , U.S.-made models are still plentiful , altho there has been some movement to places such as Mexico . Charles Kovac , a vice president of Rockwell International , which makes both chips and calculators , says that in addition to ' foreign there are about 10 to 15 American manufacturers . An equal number of firms here sell under their own names calculators made by others , he adds . He guesses that some 4 million pocket calculators were sold in the United States last year and that some 0 million or more will be sold this year .
