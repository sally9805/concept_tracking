txt At 10:30 one recent Friday night David Rice called American Airlines in Washington , D.C. , to reserve a Saturday seat , to Newark , N.J. ? " The phone rang and rang and rang and rang , and I never got an answer , " he says . So he called Eastern Airlines . After the phone rang for a while , a recorded message advised that a reservations agent would help soon if he would please hold on . Accordingly , Mr. Rice , who is deputy director of the Children 's Defense Fund , says he " waited and waited and waited and . " Next he went to Directory Assistance and got Eastern 's toll-free 800 number . Success , at last . " I got an answer from a live agent who put me on an Eastern flight , " he says . The annoying delays encountered by Mr. Rice are becoming a familiar experience for hundreds of thousands of air travelers . The Jammed telephone reservation lines at the nation 's airlines are the result of a bewildering array of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It takes a long time to explain the complicated fares to customers , and it often is difficult to locate the right seat for them among the limited number available at cut price . Many Permutations There are Discover-America excursion fares , Unlimited-Mileage fares , FreedomExcursion fares , Visit-U.S.A. fares , SuperCoach fares and Super-Saver fares  --  many of them new this spring and some of them cutting regular ticket pnces by as much as half on ? brace for this  --  round-trip travel at night except on weekends in seats purchased 30 days before departure if the return trip is made a week to 45 days later . Confusion over such intricate qualifications is n't restricted to customers . At Trans World Airlines , a beleaguered reservations agent says maybe there should be a new slogan : " A fare a day on TWA . " Continental Airlines recently decided to simplify its tariffs because , a spokesman explains , " We found to our horror that we had 19 separate fares between Los Angeles and Chicago alone . " So , in addition to selling a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time to sell each one . Eastern Airlines , for instance , tries to answer every reservations call within 20 seconds of the first ring . Last year , a spokesman says , " We made it 85% to 90% of the time . Now we 're down to about 35% . " At TWA 's St. Louis reservations center the miniature bulbs that light ' up to show calls are waiting normally burn out at the rate of 10 a day . Now , says a TWA spokesman , the $1.50 bulbs " stay on like the eternal flame ? we burn out 50 bulbs a day . " More and Longer Calls The Atlanta reservations office of Delta Air Lines says its phone volume last month " increased 70% over May a year ago to more than 700,000 calls because of the new fares . " Simultaneously , the average time it takes to handle a call also increased nearly 70% ? to about five minutes  --  because of increased fare complexities . The airlines also admit they were caught by surprise when business starting booming this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most carriers say they had been anticipating and programming their computers to handle normal business growth of 8% to 10% annually . Now they are racing to catch up ? hiring thousands of additional reservations agents and installing scores of **25;1137;TOOLONG positions that cost about $2,000 each to equip . Some airlines think they are beginning to succeed . Some customers third ' otherwise . Earlier this month , for example , Delta hurriedly moved its Atlanta reservations center into an unfinished building next door to corporate headquarters . The new center has more sophisticated , computer-controlled , call-handling equipment , plus more agents and work stations . Nonetheless , one recent Saturday it took an Atlanta customer six calls and exactly 30 minutes to get an agent . The customer 's first two calls drew busy signals . He hung up on his third call after 10 minutes and 100 rings . Two more calls , two more busy signals . On the sixth call , he was connected after seven rings to a recording : " ... some delays are as lengthy as three to five minutes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Two minutes and 45 seconds later , an agent who sounded very tired answered the phone . William Jaynes. manager of the Delta reservations office , blames such delays partly on staff unfamiliarity with/ the new equipment and partly on inadequate staffing . " It 's a great shock to us , " he confesses , " to find ourselves in this position . " It also is embarrassing for the airline 's top executives at their home base . A Delta staffer says the executives are getting a lot of complaints in addition to " about 50 or 60 calls a day that come into the general-office switchboard " from people who give up on trying to get through to reservations . A computer printout reflects the heavy load . During a mid-morning half hour one day last week 1,039 calls came into the Atlanta center . Agents handled 927 of them in an average time of six minutes , 31 seconds . At the same time , more than 100 calls were abandoned before agents could answer . The airline 's equipment does n't show how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaynes believes the worst is over . Delta 's 21 systemwide reservations centers have added 600 permanent agents so far this year and soon will hire another 148 permanent and 210 temporary agents who will work full time . The other airlines are hiring heavily , too . Eastern has added 2,000 in the past year . TWA says its reservations staff has grown by " hundreds . " United Airlines , a unit of UAL Inc. , counts " over 300 new hires " in recent months . Continental has employed " about 310 " new agents since early March . Still , average call lengths keep increasing . Even Continental says streamlining its fare structure to eliminah. all bit its " chickenfeed " and three other basic rates has n't provided the expected relief on its phones . That is because agents still have to look up all of the additional rates offered by other carriers . Officials of several airlines also worry that this summer 's extra hiring will leave than overstaffed and will force layoffs when the usual September doldrums arrive . Customers , meanwhile , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adding to their aggravation is spillover to ticket counters from the backed-up telephones . Frustrated by phone , more customers are making face-to-face reservations and holding up fellow travelers who Just want to pick up pre-ordered tickets . That is why there was a half-hour instead of normal fiveminute waiting line the other day in a downtown Atlanta Delta ticket office . At a TWA ticket office in St. Louis , edgy customers loudly disputing their places in line fell silent when a harassed woman agent behind the counter warned them that " if you do n't quit arguing , I 'm walking out of here . " Customers generally are remaining quite agreeable , the airlines say , although relatively few are as easygoing about the discount fares as a recent Continental customer . When told he could n't get a " chickenfeed " flight to Houston until July 7. he responded : " Well , what do you have to Seattle ? "
