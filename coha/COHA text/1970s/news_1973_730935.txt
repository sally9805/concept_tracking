txt You 're in your car , waiting at a stoplight . . . . Your engine ticks over . .. polluting .... How much is the stoplight to blame ? One authority goes so far as to call the stoplight the No. 1 cause of air pollution and gasoline consumption ( of course , in cahoots with the automobile itself ) . " Cars were never made for idling . They operate most efficiently at 30 to 40 m.p.h . Yet we spend one-quarter to one-half our time driving across a city either accelerating , decelerating , or idling at a stoplight , " says G. B. Buck , an engineer and former street-lighting and traffic-control researcher for General Electric Company . Gasoline wasted Some 25 to 33 percent of the 96 billion gallons of gasoline consumed each year by cars , trucks , and buses is wasted every time these vehicles come face to face with a red light or stop sign , he argues . By doubling the average traffic speed , say from 15 to 30 m.p.h. , there is not only a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monoxide pollution . Taking a conservative 10-cent cost every time a car comes to a halt ( in terms of gasoline used , wear and tear on brakes , tires , transmission , and other parts ) , one discovers that an average traffic signal stopping 2,000 cars a day incurs hidden costs of $73,000 a year . From that , a city the size of Denver with 2,000 signals in the metropolitan area , reaches a staggering loss figure of $144 million a year , or more than $100 per resident . Goal : synchronization On a national basis , then , the hidden costs of traffic signals can be extrapolated at $21 billion a year ? not to mention increased air pollution and loss of people 's time . The answer , experts respond , is not to banish all stoplights to another planet , but to synchronize the timing mechanisms to speed up traffic flow . " The eventual solution in large metropolitan areas will be toward a computer-controlled traffic system , " says David M. Baldwin , acting director of traffic operations for the U.S. Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient compromise between green and red signals . " Since cities are composed of networks of streets , traffic signals are designed " to assign the right-of-way at intersections where traffic volumes create conflicts resulting in congestion and accidents , " he says . If not assigning rights-of-way , then signals may be used to generate " platoons of traffic , " creating gaps which allow cross traffic and pedestrians a chance to move . Cities prepare Cities like New York , Chicago , Baltimore , San Jose , Calif. , Charleston , S.C. , Toronto , London , Glasgow , and Surfers Paradise , Australia , are already gearing up for fully computerized traffic-control systems . Like many cities , Chicago 's present signal system is nearly 50 years old , and based on a fixed-time cycle . Lights here change from green to red and red to green every 32 seconds . Theoretically , anyway , with Chicago streets laid out on a gridiron pattern , this cycle should keep traffic rolling at 28 m.p.h. , just below the posted speed limit . However , in the downtown area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blocking cross traffic . The result is a snail 's pace of 9 m.p.h. , extra gas consumption , and more fuming . Savings expected The computerized system for downtown Chicago , which will be ready in 1975 , will cost some $3.4 million initially , but result in an estimated savings of $5.8 million annually in vehicle-hours of delay . Sensors built into the pavement will feed traffic-volume information into the computer . The computer , in turn , will maintain a dynamic analysis of traffic patterns , selecting the signal cycle that achieves the best traffic movement : the present fixed green-time pattern , which will be used primarily during off-peak hours ; variable green-time , which favors one direction over another to speed up ingoing or outgoing traffic ; and flexible controls , which would keep cars from entering crowded intersections ? when the lane of traffic ahead is blocked ? by having the light turn red . // *Gas-guzzling stoplights // Traffic engineers are working with a galaxy of other measures to keep traffic moving more smoothly : ? Permitting right turns on red lights ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks next January ) . ? Permitting left turns on red lights from a one-way street . ? Widening streets ( or repainting street lanes ) at intersections to allow for left- and right-hand lanes . This allows through traffic to proceed without being caught behind turning vehicles . ? Building overpasses at major intersections to avoid stopping though traffic . ? Separating pedestrian and auto traffic by having pedestrians cross streets via subways or second-story walkways . ? Coordinating signal systems between municipalities that share continuing thoroughfares . ? Eliminating street parking in congested areas . ? Constructing belt highways and limited-access roads . ? Replacing stop signs with yield signs , or leaving residential intersections uncontrolled ( with the driver on the right having the right-of-way ) . Spoiled by success " When you put up too many stop signs , you 're doing a disservice , " notes one Chicago traffic engineer . " The more important signs become less meaningful because motorists are rolling at every intersection . " Traffic engineers , however , are concerned that if they 're too successful in speeding up traffic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic , as any Los Angeles freeway driver can testify . " Besides trying to move traffic efficiently , we are endeavoring to encourage people to take rapid transit and to discourage them from driving in the downtown area , " says an official for the Chicago Bureau of Street Traffic , " by cutting down on the number of parking garages .
