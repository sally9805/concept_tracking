American manners will never again rise to the whale-boned grandeur that they achieved in the imagination of Emily Post , if not always in the reality of her time . A sampling of Emily 's instructions to the well bred : <P> <P> A well behaved young girl goes to public dances only when properly chaperoned and to a private dance with her mother or else accompanied by her maid , who waits for her the entire evening in the dressing room . <P> The fact that you live in a house with two servants , or in an apartment with only one , need not imply that your house lacks charm or even distinction , or that it is not completely the home of a lady or gentleman . <P> If a young man is talking with some one when an older lady enters the room , he bows formally from where he is , as it would be rude to leave a young girl standing alone while he went up to speak to Mrs. Worldly or Mrs. Toplofty . <P> No gentleman goes to a lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman seeing a young man who is not entirely himself in the presence of ladies , quietly induces the youth to depart . <P> A young girl may hot , even with her fiance , lunch in a road house without a chaperon , or go on a journey that can by any possibility last over night . To go out with him in a small sailboat sounds harmless enough , but might result in a questionable situation if they are becalmed , or if they are left helpless in a sudden fog . The Maine coast , for example , is particularly subject to fogs that often shut down without warning ... A man and a girl went out from Bar Harbor and did not get back until next day . Everyone knew the fog had come in as thick as pea soup and that it was impossible to get home ; but to the end of time her reputation will suffer for the experience .
