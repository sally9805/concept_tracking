// ITEM Harley G. Waller became chairman and chief executive officer of National Refractory &; Brake on March I , at a salary of $211.000 plus stock options . He was just forty-two and in the prime of health ; nobody would guess from the ruddy and jovial face that his new invention , the Bufftron suit , had just been put on the market and found to cause severe skin allergies . April 1 To our stockholders : This special supplement to the annual report of the American National United Allied General Corporation  --  formerly the National Refractory &; Brake Company  --  is a salute to Chairman of the Board Harley G. Waller , whose resignation to accept a high-level government post was recently announced in the press . Truly it can be said of Mr. Waller : " He put us where we are today . " How does one begin to tell the story of so remarkable a captain , who rose steadily upward from humble beginnings to steer a mighty corporation ? Perhaps one should begin simply by saying that this was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not waste his energy on small details . Harley Waller first felt the mantle of command descend on his rugged shoulders when he was in India during World War H. The young pilot chafed under the incapacity of the C-47 to attain what he felt was optimal climbing speed in flying " over the Hump " to China . He went to Lieutenant General George Stratemeyer and begged for a chance to lead a squadron of still-experimental C-88 's on a critical supply drop to Stilwell 's beleaguered troops , pointing out that the aerodynamic properties of the C-88 were far better suited to the local altitude-mist factor . This colorful mission continues to intrigue historians of World War II . Of the twelve aircraft that roared off toward the skies of China , the sole returning plane was that of Lieutenant Waller , which he crash-landed near the base , although three of its engines had dropped out . General Stratemeyer was so impressed by young Waller 's feat and by his subsequent report appraising the C-88 as " not yet fully operational " that the boyish lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bomber Brigade . Inevitably , when the war was over , his record It11111111.13 caught the eye of highly placed officials , who brought him to Washington for the first of several tours of public service that have put him in that small circle of Americans who can only be described as businessmen-statesmen , ready to answer their country 's call for top-quality brains . As Deputy Assistant Under Secretary of the Army in the late 1940 's , Harley Waller tirelessly pressed his belief in the tank as the prime deterrent to Communist expansion in Asia . Members of congressional committees remember to this day the eloquent testimony of the engaging young man which resulted in a $200 million appropriation for development and production of the low-silhouette XM-42 " Grizzly Bear " battle tank , at a time when advocates of air power were pleading for a buildup in fighter-plane strength . Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities in Korea , in which the new enemy MiG jet proved to have greater maneuverability than the Grizzly Bear tank and a consequent advantage in destructive capability , Mr. Waller resigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from private industry , namely , the executive vice-presidency of the troubled Bartlett Motor Company , which was fighting for its very life in the sharply competitive automotive field . Moving with characteristic vigor , he launched an all-out effort to produce a semi-compact convertible . " Your average driver , " he said at a press conference announcing the ambitious program that would eventually cost $27 million , " is tired of being shut up in a steel box . He wants to get back in God 's fresh air like his dad did in the good old rumble seat . " Intense interest surrounded the choice of a name which would convey the speed and grace of the car that was rapidly taking shape on the drawing boards of Bartlett engineers . Mr. Waller himself proposed many  --  e.g. , Puma and Gazelle  --  which brilliantly anticipated the industry 's successful later use of names such as Mustang , Impala and Cougar . In the end , however , he chose to " go along with a hunch , " as he put it , " that the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he named the car for founder Karl E. Bartlett 's son , Norbert , who was retiring that year as chairman of the board . The first Norbert rolled off the assembly line on January 3 , 1954 , a date that Mr. Waller hailed as " the veritable dawn of a new age for Mr. and Mrs. America . " By an un-anticipated coincidence , 1954 also saw the general introduction of airconditioning in cars produced by rival auto-makers , a factor that markedly reduced consumer demand for the Norbert convertible . Sales of the Norbert came to 4,612 in 1954 , to 1,889 in 1955 , and ceased in 1956 with the dissolution of the Bartlett Motor Company . Harley Waller will always remember 1956 ; who could forget a year in which one is summoned to the telephone by a call from the White House ? The Eisenhower administration was about to announce the cre ation of HMR -- the Department of Human Mobility Resources  --  and it wanted Mr. Waller for the Cabinet-rank post of Secretary . " The President told me , " Mr. Waller subsequently recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mess , and he was bound and determined that HMR was going to make it possible for all Americans to exercise their inalienable right to get where they wanted to go whenever they wanted to go there . The President said he had ' kind of a feeling ' about me because the grille on the Norbert put him in mind of the cowcatchers on the old trains back in Abilene . I guess it did n't hurt that I also happen to play a pretty good game of golf . " Harley Wailer was sworn in as the nation 's first Secretary of Human Mobility Resources on September 10 , 1956 , and pledged to " get the trains moving again . " Washington quickly warmed to its newest Cabinet official , who , at only thirty-four , was being spoken of as " someone to watch . " Harley Waller and his attractive wife , Marjorie , were frequent guests at the White House , and it was Mr. Waller whom the President often tapped for a round of golf when the awesome burdens of the Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harley , " the President said . " He knows just how far to go with that homespun humor of his . " Veteran White House correspondents still chuckle over the time when Mr. Waller placed on Ike 's tee a small cream pie that he had molded into the shape of a golf ball . The resulting consternation when the club connected for its " drive " brought tears of mirth to the President 's eyes . " By golly , " he is reported to have said , " I can almost face Foster Dulles again now . " At HMR , it did not take long for Harley Waller to analyze the problem and to formulate a " grand design . " As a boy he had enjoyed tinkering with machines ; now he became fascinated by the emerging technology of computers as the answer to America 's deteriorating human mobility apparatus . " One of my options , " he told the New York Times , " was to go along with the top dozen men in the department who had years of experience in the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't throw anything onto the table that was much newer than the Iron Horse . i saw it was going to be up to me to dream up a sophisticated system of inputs that would bring ground transportation into the space age . " Mr. Waller felt that citizen dissatisfaction stemmed from the fact that daily interstate passenger trains had dwindled from 20,000 in the late 1920 's to 884 . He blamed the downward trend on " skyrocketing " labor demands in the wage and featherbedding area . " Let 's face it , there are a lot of guys just sitting on their butts getting a free ride around the country , " he told a press breakfast , at which he announced his " Invisible Man " project . This , he said , would replace all but 217 of the nation 's 1,058,000 railroad employees with an automated system of memory modules operated from the HMR Building in Washington . " At an average wage of $5,500 including benefits , " he noted , " we can effectuate an annual savings of $5.8 billion , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dough , I 'll be the most surprised guy in the world . " A feasibility study , launched in December of 1956 , resulted in the awarding of a contract to the Premier Electronics Corp . ( PRELCO ) for construction of a prototype memory module network . The prototype , which was completed early in 1958 and tested on a commuter run of the Long Island Railroad between Jamaica and Patchogue , encouraged Mr. Waller to give the go-ahead for full-scale automation of America 's railroads . Meanwhile , he initiated the graduated layoff plan , whereby engineers , brakemen , switchmen , conductors and ticket clerks who died or retired would not be replaced . The personnel force had accordingly been pared by 28 percent when PRELCO finished construction and began installation of its $426 million TGX-32-0014A ( " Dagwood " ) electronic nerve center in January of 1959 . How impatiently Harley Waller waited for the day when the vast complex would be assembled and he could push a button that would commence the operation of all of America 's trains from the HMR Building ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 the TGX-32-0014A was placed in standby condition pending the outcome of further feasibility studies . Two weeks later President Eisenhower announced the appointment of Harley Waller as ambassador to Taiwan . " Believe me , would n't give up a golf partner who shoots in the low 70 's , " Ike told reporters , " if I did n't think he was the only man with the sensitivity to human nature that is so important right now to our friendship with the peoples of the Far East . " Seasoned observers of SinoAmerican relations still mention the dogged skill with which the new ambassador recovered from the " chink in the armor " speech that he delivered upon his arrival at Taipei , urging immediate reoccupation of the mainland . His persistent efforts to have Quemoy and Matsu admitted as full members of the United Nations are regarded as a bold diplomatic initiative to maintain a balance between " our guys " and " their guys , " and Mr. Waller is known to have felt that these efforts fell short of fruition only because the Eisenhower administration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he realized , to go back to the private sector , and in August of 1960 he resigned to accept the presidency of the huge DeBuff Chemical Company . Once again he exhibited a sure instinct for the route where he could best serve humanity . Little could he know it , but his conception and leadership at DeBuff of the three-year , $62 million research program which developed the synthetic wool , Bufftron ? " the suit that came out of a test tube " ? was being watched by another chieftain of free enterprise . In his paneled office at the National Refractory &; Brake Company , eighty-two-year-old Roger S. Bassinger was eager to turn over the reins to a man whose vision of the future would match the dreams that he himself had nurtured as an eighteen-year-old lad making bicycle brakes in a tool shed in Sandusky . Now , on a late December day in 1963 , the old tycoon picked up the phone and invited Harley Waller to meet him for lunch . Harley G. Waller became chairman and chief executive officer of National Refractory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of $211,000 plus stock options . He was just forty-two and in the prime of health ; nobody would guess from the ruddy and jovial face that his beloved Bufftron suit had just been put on the market and found to cause severe skin allergies . " This is one of those rare instances in the long march of American capitalism , " declared Roger S. Bassinger at a company ceremony at which he handed over the key to his rolltop desk , " when the man and the job and the moment are ideally joined . He is a man who knows his way around Washington and , if I know Harley , that means one thing . It means that National Refractory is going to demand a much bigger slice of the defense-contract pie . With our nation poised on the eve of a bright sunrise in space and an expanding counter-deterrent presence in South Vietnam , Harley Waller is not , I assure you , a man to sit on the sidelines and watch some other team bring home the bacon . " The new chairman lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast industrial empire . DIVERSIFY OR PERISH was his credo , he said . Nevertheless , Wall Street was caught off guard by his initial move  --  acquisition of Titan Films  --  not only because the motion picture firm had failed to produce a box-office hit since Cleopan-a Meets the Prodigal Son , but because the entertainment field was not one that the " smart money " expected NR &B; to enter . Wall Street soon learned , however , not to count on Harley Waller to do what was expected . His was a restless mind that despised the obvious . " Do n't get me wrong , I love movies , " he told financial reporters , " but very frankly Titan was n't the apple I was after in that particular barrel . l acquired Titan in order to acquire the Smiley Rent-a-Car Corporation , which Titan had acquired in 1963 , in order to acquire Full-o ' - Pep Breakfast Cereals , which Smiley acquired in 1962 , and of course Full-o ' - Pep owns the Honolulu Mets . So what we have essentially done is toput National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer-interest areas of food and sport with their hoped-for high-profitability potential . " The merger was but the first of many that soon brought under one umbrella a dazzling spectrum of companies which reflected Harley Waller 's own wide-ranging intellect . It was inevitable , for example , that a man steeped in public service would feel impelled to take a leadership role in the education and opinion sector , and nobody who knew him was surprised by his 1966 acquisition of the KGB Communications Group , which comprised the Macon Journal-In gencer , station WGOB-TV in Lubbock , Tee ' n ' Green magazine , and Skool-Aid Learning Tools . Similarly , his purchase of Dalton Brothers , the venerable cough-drop concern , bespoke his passionate belief in a better life for Americans through cosmetic and pharmaceutical research . Indeed , that belief was attested by the lively public interest in two projects that he launched in the Dalton division : the attempt to develop a tangle-free hair curler and the quest for a " 3-in-1 " aspirin , nasal decongestant and birth-control pill . But , pragmatist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not live by peace alone . It was not enough for the humanist in him to broaden the firm 's stake in a better America ; the patriot in him served notice that the bread-and-butter task was to keep America strong , and he resolved to make NR &B; the largest producer of weaponry in the free world . " You can count on it that somebody 's always going to be doing a little shooting somewhere , " he said upon negotiation of a $270 million revolving credit loan with eighteen banks in 1965 , " and I pledge that wherever that shooting is going on  --  at sea , on land or in the skies  --  one of our products is going to be shooting back . " The speech , so typical in its optimism , sent NR &B; stock up eleven and a half poin ts , and Wall Street analysts sat back to see how even so shrewd a corporate architect as Harley Waller could put together an arsenal diverse enough to meet every contingency that a cunning enemy might devise . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a month , NR &B; acquired Allied Affiliated Pomeroy , the conglomerate that had been formed only three weeks earlier by the merger of Allied Aircraft ( manufacturer of the F-42 " Osprey " ) , Affiliated Aeronautics ( manufacturer of the P-71 " Cormorant " ) and the Pomeroy Plane Company ( maker of the Y-22 " Buzzard " helicopter ) . " Here you 've got a tragic situation , " Mr. Waller noted , " of three great companies making three great planes that are being sold to two-hit countries like Paraguay when they could he doing a job for our boys in the navy , the air force and the army in Vietnam and Laos . I 'm going to Washington  --  and those planes are going to Vietnam and Laos ! " And go to Washington he did , returning from Continued on page 109 UPWAED FAELUTRE continued from page 28 the Pentagon with $8.3 billion worth of contracts in his pocket for production and delivery of 7,395 planes of all three types over the next five years . It only remained for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisition of General Fire &; Bomb , the 102-year-old manufacturer of sporting and military explosives , which he converted to production of " atomic hardware , " taking particular pride in being named contractor for the " hair-trigger " nuclear warhead for the multiple independently targeted re-entry system of the " Night Watchman " ballistic missile . Stage I was over . In only two years an edifice of staggering complexity had been built . Now the job was to put it in smooth functioning order  --  and , incidentally , give it a new name . " ' National Refractory &; Brake ' does n't really tell our story anymore , " Harley Waller was quoted as saying in the TIME cover article of August 9 , 1966 ( " Modern Midas " ) . With his customary flair , he rechristened it the American National United Allied General Corporation . A lesser man would have quailed at the challenge of running an industrial family that had mushroomed with incredible speed into 22 divisions and 113,000 employees . But Harley Waller was " a clean-desk guy , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior vice-presidents reported to 22 executive vice-presidents who reported to 11 group vice-presidents who reported to him . Democratic process , to Harley Waller , was the Holy Writ of business leadership . Yet in the final analysis he knew that command is a lonely burden , and he never shrank from using his veto to take the company on a course that might seem counter to the prevailing financial wisdom . No man , of course , is infallible , and no human institution exempt from the capricious winds of fortune . Harley Waller knew this as well as anyone , and he took a philosophical view of developments in several areas that markedly delayed product acceptability . In the Titan Films division , the revelation by Ralph Nader of a high phosphorus content in Full-o ' - Pep cereals , coupled with an " epidemic " of loose engine mounts in Smiley Rent-a-Car vehicles and of bone chips on the pitching staff of the Honolulu Mets , contributed to a reversal of anticipated upturn in these companies from 1966 to 1971 . In the Skool-Aid Learning Tools line , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resultant adverse publicity , led to the cancellation of sizable textbook orders from the school systems of Chicago , Detroit and Los Angeles . One should also mention the negative impact on projected earnings in the Dalton Drug division , arising from lawsuits brought by " not 100-percent-satisfied " users of the 3-in-1 aspirin , nasal decongestant and birth-control pill . Performance continued to he excellent , however , in the refractory and brake divisions and , as of December 1971 , Mr. Waller announced that the shakedown phase was over in " all but one or two " of the consumer product companies . But what ultimately tested and proved the mettle of Harley G. Waller was the intricate task of arming the defenders of democracy in Southeast Asia . The Pentagon contracts called for delivery of 2,016 Osprey fighters by 1968 at a cost of $2.6 billion , 3,882 Cormorant jets by 1969 at $3.9 billion , and 1,497 Buzzard helicopters by 1970 at $1.8 billion . That these projections might Continued on page 127 // continued from page 109 prove unrealistic was sensed when the Osprey target date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost of $3.5 billion . The 12,000 percent overrun and writeoff-1,677 fewer planes for $900 million more  --  had the salubrious effect of enabling Harley Waller to " fully identify the areas where cost and time budgets were significantly below the upward inflationary spiral . " He instigated a crash program to deliver both the Cormorant and the Buzzard substantially ahead of target date and below cost . What he could not have foreseen was the untimely " peace offensive " of 1968 and 1969 with its stretch-out in military procurement , resulting in the cancellation of Pentagon orders for the Cormorant and the Buzzard while both were in full production . " It 's a heck of an interesting situation , " Harley Waller commented . " On the Osprey I was over on cost and under on planes . On these two , I 'm under on money and over on the planes . Well , I guess I can always sell them to Paraguay , " he joked , with that resilience which so endeared him to his colleagues . Indeed , as 1971 drew to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit loan , had concluded a $68 million long-term debt payment agreement with the Banque de Zurich , and , had issued six million additional shares of common stock to raise $57 million for amortization of the Osprey write-off . The only major item still unsettled was the $1.3 billion deficit for the 827 Cormorant and Buzzard aircraft which were in various stages of manufacture at the time of the Pentagon 's canceling order and which Mr. Waller felt it was " only proper " to complete . " You can bet Uncle Sam will pick up that tab if they want the company to stay in business , " he wrote in his Christmas letter to the employees , and nobody was more surprised than he when President Nixon entered the impasse on February 16 and ruled that " the financial rescue of a corporation that finds itself in an overstock piling situation would not only be an unhealthy precedent but , frankly , just too darn expensive . " " Happily , there is one other option , " the Chief Executive stated , " and I personally feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best traditions of good sportsmanship . " So the moment came last month for Harley Waller to pack his bags for Washington once again and to bid an emotional farewell in the company auditorium to his fellow voyagers on one of America 's great adventures . Goodbye , Harley . Our thoughts and prayers will go with you in your new position as Secretary of Defense .
