Some viewers might think that the members of PBS 's American Family ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) were naive to let a television crew film their private life for months at a time . Pat Loud , the mother of the troupe , agreed . Out from behind her big sunglasses , she told Dick Cavett that she did not see " anything wrong with being naive . I see something really wrong with being sophisticated . " Son Lance Loud , 21 , tossing his hair and playing the homosexual heavy , said , " Sure I 'm glad I did it-People call up and murmur things into the phone and then hang up . " As for his mother , he said , without the film " she would 've been left in the dark about a lot more things . I do n't want her to grow up with too many illusions . " Why had the family let itself be filmed ? Said Lance : " It 's like who wants to die in an airplane crash , when you can commit suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Father Bill Loud answered : " We would have done more of a Laugh-In type of thing . " The publicity did n't impress much : " I 'm very big in a liquor store and very big in a barbershop and that 's about it ... I think life will go on just like it 's gone and we 'll be the late movies and that 's it . " <P> Last December , after Chief Justice Warren Burger complained about the smokers on the Amtrak Metroliners between Washington and New York , cigars and pipes were prohibited in first-class cars . Pipe-puffing Senator Hugh Scott wrote to Non-Smoker Burger to ask him to rescind his request to Amtrak : " May it please the court , " said Scott , he wanted a ruling " to the effect that pipe smokers may enjoy the use of the presently interdicted area for the indulgence of their contemplative addiction . " Burger 's answer to Scott has not been revealed . <P> Five years ago , hostile students at England 's University of Dundee were brought around by their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is youth which has rediscovered love and humor as weapons of psychological warfare , which has endorsed biblical simplicity in the face of police dogs , " said black-gowned Actor-Writer-Director Peter Ustinov . Recently when 300 of his charges tried to get him sacked after he failed to back them in a rent strike , Ustinov accused them of political chicanery , deceit and cynicism . " I sometimes see England as an enormous nest with lots of little birds all opening their mouths for a piece of the cake , " said the tireder , wiser rector . When his term expires this year , he added , he will not run again . <P> Nightclubs are coming back . Couples are holding hands under candlelit tables and listening to songs they can hum along with . One good reason is fast-footed Singer-Dancer Joel Grey , 40 , veteran of Cabaret , from both the stage version and the movie , for which he is up for an Oscar . Now he is back I in the kind of cabaret he says he likes ; best . Lugging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I around the stage at the Waldorf , Joel clowns with the audience about his 30 years in show business : " I was n't born in a trunk , but I might as well have been .
