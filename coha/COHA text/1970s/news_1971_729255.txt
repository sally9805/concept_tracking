txt The Board of Education announced yesterday that it would make a series of " severe cuts " in educational services , effective within two weeks , because the school system is $40-million short of the money it needs for the balance of the 1970.71 term . In making the announcement at a news conference , the board president , Murry Bergtraum , said preliminary indications were that the cuts would include the following : Reduction in teaching services at all levels of instruction ; a " complete freeze " on the employment of substitute teachers ; " severe reductions " in headquarters and district office personnel ; discontinuation of all after-school activities , including instructional ones ; indefinite postponement of school repairs and maintenance , and more stringent regulations on the use of transportation passes by students to get to school . Consequences of Action " This is one of the blackest days that I can recall , " Mr. Bergtraum said , " and my recollection goes back to the days of Fiorello La Guardia . " He said the quality of education " is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he indicated that the schools still might end up with more teachers through the end s4 the term than they had last year . While Mr. Bergtraum vas making his announcement , Mayor Lindsay joined with the Mayors of the six largest cities in the state in warning a state commission of imminent drastic reductions in education services and pleading for a state takeover of local education budgets . Weekend Discussions Mr. Bergtraum said that details of the cuts were to be worked out this weekend in meetings involving the central board , Chancellor Harvey B. Scribner and his staff , community school boards and superintendents and the leaders of unions representing school employes . The details are to be announced early next week , the board president added . Mayor Lindsay 's office , he said , asked the board to cut costs this year by employing ; a device used in the past ? not filling all teaching positions . The board president explainecl in an interview after ' yesterday 's news conference at board headquarters in Brooklyn that in prior years , " we were unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We saved $30-million a year that way , " lie said . " Now , because our recruiting policy has improved , we have filled them . " In a formal statement on the board 's action , a spokesman for Mayor Lindsay said the Mayor " shares the Board of Education 's pain in making their announcement today , as well as the pain of our entire schodl community . As extremely difficult as it is , the Mayor believes the board has taken the only responsible course . " In his statement , Mr. Bergtraum explained that " when the 1970.71 budget was adopted last year , we warned that the amount allocated , $1.5-billion , was inadequate to permit us to operate at the same level of operation as we had during the previous school year . " To maintain the same level of operation would have required an estimated $59-million more , he said . More Funds Provided In response to Board of Education pleas last year , Mr. Bergtraum went on , the Board of Estimate and City Council provided an additional $15-million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Mayor Lindsay 's office continued to press the Board of Education to effect savings during the 1970-71 school year , but that the board had tried and was unable to do so . Mr. Bergtraum said the board had a recent series of meetings with Mayor Lindsay and his staff to seek more funds and had been informed that " the city is in the midst of a severe financial crisis , " that it faced a shortage itself of $300-million this year and that , in short , " the cupboard is bare . " " In the face of this reality , " Mr. Bergtraum continued , " we have no alternative except to proceed to institute a series of severe cuts so that we can meet the budget gap . " At the news conference , Mr .. Bergtraum noted that " when this board first took office in 1969 , we issued , on June 10 , a statement that we would not take even one step backward in the education of the city 's children , and refused to accept the mandated $86-million cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Board of Education said that if the $86-million cut were insisted upon , it would run the schools at full , levels of service until money ran out . Subsequently , in Mr. Bergtraum 's words , " the Mayor , tapped a whole bunch of sources which gave us the $86-million . " " We would take similar action now except for two facts , " he continued . " First , we are told that the city is in the midst of the most severe financial crisis in its history . Second , last year the State Legislature enacted a law which prohibits us from taking the type ' of action we took in June of 1969 . " " We grieve for our city and the plight that it is in , " the board president said . " We grieve for all the staff that will be affected by this action . But most of all , we grieve for the children of our city who will be the ones to bear the major brunt of this necessary action . " Some City Hall observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be made public by April 15 and that service cuts by city agencies are often threatened at such times in an effort to put pressure on the state to increase fiscal aid . " This is not a part of the budget charade , " Mr. Bergtraum said yesterday . " This Is real . " He said he hoped that financial aid from the city , state or Federal government might pull the board of out its immediate plight . But he made it clear it was a slim hope that " does n't have any basis in reality . Details Unavailable Both Mr. Bergtraum and Dr. Scribner resisted all attempts to get them to be more specific about the cutbacks , explaining that until this weekend 's meetings are over , any details supplied would almost surely be inaccurate . " The last place we want to reach for in making the cuts are those who directly affect children , " Dr. Scribner said . Isaiah E. Robinson Jr. , black member of the board , said he believed the cuts could lead to racial problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . nel , " he explained , " that means a shift in personnel . And the youngest , newest personnel are the blacks . " He said they would probably be shifted first .
