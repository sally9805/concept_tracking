The leaders of the House of Representatives last week were quietly preparing for the worst : that the case of Spiro Agnew will be handed to them to consider impeachment proceedings against the Vice President . The contingency planning actually began well before Agnew 's difficulties were known , when the possibility , however unlikely , first loomed during Watergate that the President himself might be impeachable . Months ago New Jersey 's Peter Rodino Jr. , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , put three of his staff to work researching the procedures of impeachment . Speaker of the House Carl Albert and the leadership discussed whether a special committee should be created or , as has been the practice in the past , the Judiciary Committee should first act on a motion from the floor to impeach the President . In the end , they decided to let the Judiciary Committee handle it , and Rodino and his staff now stand ready to begin proceedings within 24 hours should the need arise . <P> Those forms would also apply to handling the Agnew case , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent Neil MacNeil . Whereas any conceivable misdeeds that could bring Nixon to impeachment took place while he was President , what is known of the Agnew charges largely deal with actions that occurred before he became Vice President . There is a solid precedent that such prior offenses may not be grounds for impeachment . <P> That precedent is the 19th century case of Schuyler ( " Smiler " ) Colfax , a politician from Indiana so famous for his public piety that he was also nicknamed " the Christian Statesman . " Colfax served as a U.S. Representative from 1855 to 1869 , including seven years as Speaker of the House , before becoming Ulysses S. Grant 's Vice President . <P> In 1872 , while Vice President , he was accused by House investigators of having taken a bribe during his tenure as Speaker by accepting 20 shares of stock in the infamous Credit Mobilier of America , a company organized to build the first transcontinental railroad - with millions of dollars in Government subsidies . To prevent an investigation of their enormous profits - dividends in 1868 alone amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company protectively placed shares among friendly Congressmen . Before a House investigating committee , Colfax unconvincingly denied that his stock was intended as a bribe . The committee then also discovered that he had accepted a campaign gift of $4,000 in 1868 from a contractor who had supplied envelopes to the Government at a time when Colfax was chairman of the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads . <P> Faced with such overwhelming evidence of misconduct , the House Judiciary Committee investigated whether the House should impeach Colfax . The question was posed thus by the committee : " What is the nature and what the objects of impeachment under our Constitution ? Are they punitive or remedial ? <P> Or , in other words , is impeachment a constitutional remedy for removing obnoxious persons from an office , and preventing their again filling office , or a power given for punishing an officer , while he is an officer , for some crime alleged to have been committed by him before he was such an officer ?
