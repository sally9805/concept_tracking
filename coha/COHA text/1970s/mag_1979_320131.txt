E. coli makes a vital hormone <P> Somatotropin is one of the body 's important chemicals . Produced by the tiny pituitary gland at the base of the brain , it promotes normal physical growth , hence its other name , human growth hormone ( HGH ) . The chemical is vital in the treatment of a certain form of dwarfism . Unless children who are deficient in the hormone receive injections of HGH , they rarely reach five feet in height . The supply , however , is severely limited : somatotropin can only be obtained from cadavers , and about 50 of the pea-sized glands are needed to treat just one child for a year ( cost : $5,800 ) <P> That shortage may soon be eased . In the most dramatic display yet of the controversial genetic engineering technique known as recombinant DNA , independent teams at the University of California in San Francisco and at a small commercial research firm , Genentech Inc. , in nearby Palo Alto , used human pituitary tissue to construct the gene , or DNA segment , responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genetic machinery of a laboratory strain of the common intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli . The gene splicing worked : the re-engineered bugs began to make HGH . <P> Several obstacles must yet be overcome . Among them : getting the bacteria to produce pure HGH and testing the substance in living creatures , including man . Still , the scientists hope that within two years vats of genetically redesigned E. coli will be acting as minifactories , churning out sufficient somatotropin to treat dwarfism . There may also be enough to test a long held suspicion : that HGH can help heal burns , wounds , bone fractures and even bleeding ulcers.
