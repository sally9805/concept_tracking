In an effort to advance the cause of Women 's Liberation , the feminist movement has launched a host of publications ranging from radical underground broadsides ( Off Our Backs ) to slick monthlies ( New Woman ) . Some of these new journals now appear only sporadically because of money troubles . The latest Lib effort previews this week as a 44 page supplement to the year end issue of New York magazine . It seems far more promising than its predecessors , principally because its editor is feminism 's superstar , Gloria Steinem . <P> Titled Ms. after the movement 's preferred form of female address ( instead of Mrs. or Miss ) , the magazine will appear on its own in January with a special double issue and then lie dormant until late spring , when monthly publication is scheduled to start . Elizabeth Harris , 49 , a former vice president of CRM , Inc . ( Psychology Today , Intellectual Digest ) , will serve as publisher . Editor Steinem , 37 , envisions Ms. as a nonsexist " how to " magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly but how to seize control of your life . " <P> Clubby Intensity . New York is giving a helping hand at the start primarily because Steinem and several of her writers are members of its own staff . Judging by the first issue , Ms. would seem to have a lot of New York 's clubby , with intensity but not enough of its firecracker prose or provocative flair . <P> Inevitably , the supplement 's graphics are those of New York itself , but Steinem &; Co. are still in search of a style of their own for future issues . In " The Housewife 's Moment of Truth , " New York Contributing Editor Jane O'Reilly outlines a seven-point program of back stiffening for women who want their men to share more of the household chores , but concludes sadly that living up to it may well prove impossible . In a fit of Msogamy , Freelancer Susan Edmiston charges that the traditional marriage ceremony locks the woman into a subservient state ; she advocates that formal contracts be signed before marriage that will spell out responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. also contains a bristly , jargon-loaded attack on sexist child rearing by Author Letty Cottin Pogrebin ( How to Make It in a Man 's World ) . She roundly condemns " sex-stereotyped " toys , books , games and emotions ( girls are " cuddled , " boys " rough-housed " ) that reinforce " role rigidity " and inhibit " gender freedom . " Pogrebin takes TV commercials particularly to task for imparting to children the dictum that ruggedness makes the man and prettiness the woman . <P> In the lead article , Editor Steinem rather solemnly defines what she considers to be the rationale for the Liberation movement . Women , writes Steinem , " share the dreams , capabilities and weaknesses of all human beings , but our occasional pregnancies and other visible differences have been used to mark us for an elaborate division of labor that may once have been practical , but has since become cruel and false . The division is continued for clear reason , consciously or not : the economic and social profit of men as a group . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
