txt WASHINGTON  --  The fading health of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev has added a new complication and urgency to the Carter administration 's drive to wrap up a new strategic arms limitation treaty SALTI , say informed sources here . The 72-year-oid Brezhnev 's condiuon Is now too fragile to permit him to fly to Washington for a summit meeting with President Carter to sign a treaty , the sources say . Besides , they suggest , the Soviets would not want to expose their ailing leader to the inevitable comparisons that would be made around the world between a Brezhnev visit and the public relations triumph scored by rival China 's Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping on his recent American tour . So any Carter-Brezhnev summit on SALT is likely to be held in Europe , sources say , with speculation focusing on Geneva , Vienna , and Helsinki . THE PRECARIOUSNESS of Brezhnev 's health , illustrated most recently in the postponement of French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing 's visit to Moscow because Brezhnev had influenza , adds urgency to the SALT process because of the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It Is taken for granted that Brezhnev 's successor would need some time to establish himself and consolidate his authority before getting around to SALT . There is no question , according to informed sources here , that failing health ? including heart disease , emphysema , and circulatory problems  --  has now " impaired Brezhnev 's ability to function , " as one put it . " I do n't think anyone would be surprised if he died tomorrow , " one source said . ' ; On the other hand I do n't know anything specific among his accumulating ailments that would kill him in two years . " Because of his health , the source said , Brezhnev would not be up to actually negotiating personally any points left to settle in the SALT negotiations . The treaty would have to be tied up in every detail in advance so all he would have to do is sign it , the source said . ONE REASON for summit meetings , he said , Is that Carter and other United States presidents have felt is useful to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now almost irrelevant for a SALT summit , the source said , " because the only impression of Brezhnev Carter is going to get is how infirm he The Soviets , the source said , would find it " embarrassing " to have en infirm Brezhnev come to this country and be compared to China 's Deng Xiaoping , " who was a dynamo running all over the country . " " They could n't shelter him Brezhnev from the news media here , " the source said . A U.S. senator who met with Brezhnev in Moscow late last year agrees with experts here that Brezhnev 's health is deteriorating and that he now is unable to travel except by train . " ' they Just wo n't put him in an airplaae again , " the senator said . THE ADMINISTRATION 'S ? concern with Brezhnev 's health and the succes // Brezhnev 's illness adds urgency to SALT talks Carter administration seeks summit to complete new treaty // slon question was made clear in a re cent Chicago speech by Zbigniew BrezI inski , Carter 's national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new leaders or all the major aspects of future Soviet policy , " Brezinski said in urging approval of SALT . But , he ; said , " when the next generation of Soviet leaders decides its policies toward strategic arms and toward the U. S. , we want them to face clear and agreed restraints on the competition in strategic arms . " That concern about the Soviet future has intensified interest in the larger question of who will succeed Brezhnev and what direction a new Soviet ' leadership will take . That question Is almost a total mystery because most of the current Soviet leaders are old men with no political futures . Among the nine " candidate members , " the Communist Party 's ruling politburo , one is over 80 , six , including Brezhnev , are over 70 , five are over 60 , and only one is under 60 . The average age is 69 . Among the nine " candidate members , three are over 70 , four over 60 , and only two under 60 . The average age there is 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next 10 , said one expert on Soviet affairs , " what you 're talking about is not just replacing Brezhnev " but " a virtual overhaul , a large scale turnover " of the politburo . In the short term , were Brezhnev to die soon , what appears most likely now would be a " two-stage transition " in which the immediate successor would be an elderly sort of " caretaker " who would preside until the arrival of someone from a new generation . At the moment , experts say , the likeliest successor appears to be Andrei Kirileaks , who is also 72 but in better health than Brezhnev and who is a member of both the politburo and the party sectelariat . But , specialists here say , there also have been hints lately that Kirilenko 's star may be dimming . And once you get past him , " one expert said , all the other likely contenders in the politburo group appear to have " more things disqualifying them than qualifying them " for the top spot . ? IT ALSO HAS become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old men " now running the Kremlin are trying to postpone the day when they have to turn things over to younger leaders . It is almost as if they sense , one source said , that once they open the door to anyone from a new generation , ? they will all be gone . For example , he said , when Brezhnev took for himself the job of president as well as party leader , the man appointed as his deputy was 78 years old . When a new defense minister was named several years ago , the choice was Dmitri Ustinov , now 70 . " Time and again they have passed up opportunities to bring in a new generation , " one source said . The youngest member of the politburo now , Grigori Romanov , 56 , is considered to be ambitious , perhaps too ambitious . But he is now party boss of Leningrad and therefore , like some other " provincial " leaders , not regarded as likely to be able to get to the top without first getting to the power center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need " considerable time to build up his political authority and power " and is not likely to , become , as Brezhnev is , both party boss and president . This process , sources say , is likely to produce a period of " inertia " in almost all areas of policy , including foreign affairs issues such as SALT , and no drastic or immediate Shifts in direction would be likely . A new leader , sources say , might well // Leonid Brezhnbv making a speech in the Kremlin last month . have to pay more attention immediately to Soviet domestic problems than to foreign affairs . " They the Soviets are facing some serious economic problems , " one source said , and there is increasing criticism in the leadership of the way the economy is being run . Beyond Brezhnev , the two politburo members whose names are best known to Americans are Prime Minister Alexel Kosygin , who Is 75 , and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , 70 . Neither of them is thought a likely successor . Kosygin in particular has been the target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist Party 's top leaders plan to meet in Moscow this week , and specialists here say it will be interesting to see what , if anything , is done in the way of shifts in the hierarchy .
