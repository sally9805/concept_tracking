txt Secretary of State William P. Rogers warned the United Nations today that expulsion of Nationalist China to make way for Communist Chinese membership would be a " perilous " course for the international organization . He spoke before the U. N. General Assembly , addressing delegates from 130 member countries . Rogers proposed a six-point program for peaceful settlement between Arabs and Israelis with an interim agreement on reopening the Suez Canal . Tells Nixon Goal Rogers said President Nixon had altered U. S. policy toward Communist China to bring it into line with realties and to " foster prospects for a stable peace in years to come . " The United States wanted the ' ' Peking regime to take a seat in the assembly and in the Security Council but not at the expense of ousting Taiwan , Rogers said . The Communists have demanded the ouster of Taiwan . " The path of expulsion is perilous , " Rogers said . " To open it for one would be to open it for many . " It would be unrealistic to expel from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Taiwan greater than the populations of two-thirds of the 130 U. N. members . " Further , it would be unjust to expel a member which has participated for over 25 years in the work of this organization with unfailing devotion to the principles set forth in the charter . " Rogers took a swipe at the Soviet Union , saying everyone knew Byelorussia and the Ukraine , which have memberships in the U. N. , were not separate states . This goes back to the founding of the U. N. 25 years ago when Moscow insisted on having three votes while the United States received only one . Seeks Ouster Rogers called the resolution offered by Albania and other Red China sponsors demanding Taiwan 's ouster as " punitive . " " It does not seek to deal with facts but to excoriate and condemn , " he said . " Its essence is not to admit the People 's Republic of China but to expel the Republic of China and to expel it ' forthwith . ' Rogers charged that some countries who for long had extolled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states in the U. N. were now seeking to violate it . " If the U. N. is to embrace universality then surely the admission of one member should not be accompanied by the expulsion of another member , " he added . Vote Nears Votes on Red Chinese membership and Taiwan 's expulsion are expected about Oct. 20 . Turning to the Middle East , Rogers said matters there hung in " precarious balance . " He called for the disputing parties to take " a major step forward " and agree on reactivation of the Suez Canal . He proposed a series of six steps as follows : 1 . Reopening the canal as partial implementation of the 1967 U. N. Sedulity Council resolution calling for a peace settlement , secure boundaries , guarantees , solution of the refugee problem and withdrawal of Israeli forces . 2 . Maintain the cease-fire with the ultimate objective a " permanent end to belligerency. " 3 . Zone of withdrawal ? " looking to an overall settlement . " 4 . Supervisory arrangements such as " adequate machinery for prompt detection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Suez Canal . Parties disagree on crossing of Egyptian military personnel , but " the possibilities of some compromise are not negative . " G. Use of the *canal . The United States has long held the canal should bo " open to passage for all nations without discrimination . " " A practical step now , an interim agreement , would make the next step toward peace less difficult for all the parties . to take , " Rogers said , " If the leaders ' of the area would grasp ! this Opportunity , they would give new hope to their people for tranquility , ter progress and for peace . " Rogers also urged ' the choosing of " an outstanding . successor " to Secretary . General . U Thant , who wants to retire , this year for health reasons . On the U. N .. financial problems , Rogers said : the responsibility lay with those ' who had failed to pay their share . The Russians and French refuse to pay for peace-keeping . Rogers added that it was hard to underatand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reminded the members that the United states had contributed Well over 50 per cent of the costs of the International Relief Program for the East Pakistan refugees fleeing into India . Rogers and Foreign Minister Abbe Eban of Israel later conferred privately for more than an hour tonight on possible common ground with ' the Egyptians for an interim . reopening of the Suez Canal . " All the concessions have been . made on our side , " asserted Eban as he emerged from the conference in the Waldorf Towers . " The next stage is up to Egypt . We feel strongly there should be no crossing of , the canal by military or para-military forces . " One of the stumbling blocks has Been the Arab demand t h a t . Israelis withdraw their troops and allow Egyptian military personnel to occupy the canal zone on both sides . The Israeli minister brought up the question of obtaining additional military aircraft , according to State Department sources , and Rogers replied , " This issue remains under review in Washington .
