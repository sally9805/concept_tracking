txt The Soviet press , which has been urging the public to conserve bread in view of the poor grain harvest , has reported the first sentencing of a citizen for feeding store-bought bread and grain to household livestock . The newspaper Socialist Industry announced that Mrs. Antonina Sautin of the town of Kirsanov , Tambov Province , had been buying 10 to 15 loaves of bread daily for her three-member family until the sales clerk reduced her order to four loaves . A local newspaper simultaneously denounced her bread buying , whereupon local authorities placed her on trial . Search of her home turned up nearly 500 pounds of bread , grain , and cereals . The court confiscated these stocks , together with her 430-pound sow and two other pigs . It gave her- a - two- year suspended-jail sentence and ordered her , presumably on grounds that she was an idler , to go to work on a constructionproject . Her husband , employed at a railroad station , was expelled from the Communist Party . The report seemed a warning to millions of Soviet citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry , and often depend on store-bought bread and grain to eke out the feed they raise on small garden plots . More than 10 percent of the country 's livestock is raised privately by town dwellers and approximately another 15 percent as the personal property of collective and state farm workers . Newspapers previously had denounced hoarding of grain , rice , and macaroni , as well as rumors of shortages leading to scare buying . Although the capital is generally better supplied than other cities , lines have formed at many shops selling potatoes . Some sources report that out-of-town buyers have swelled the queues and that highway police have been ordered to limit the amount of potatoes and cabbage carried out of Moscow by car . One newspaper reported that an official of a radio factory in Barnaul , where the crop was good , had shipped 760 pounds of potatoes to a colleague in another plant in Vorenezh , 3,600 miles away , in the guise of radio parts . The press has assured readern that state retail prices will remain firm and no one will lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distilleries have been forbidden to use edible potatoes for vodka , and in some places customers are reported confined to a purchase limit of seven pounds of potatoes at one time . The excellent harvest in Kazakhstan , where Army truck drivers pitched in to help farmers bring in the crop , has brightened the picture somewhat , but is unlikely to cancel out poor results elsewhere . Most of the Kazakhstan grain is believed to have a 30 percent moisture content . It will have to be dried to 14 percent before storage , hence high losses are apt to cut the barn yield . // *Soviet public warned // One informed source has estimated that the poor harvest will ultimately cost the state budget a total of 20 billion ruble ? ( $24 billion ) in various ways . One effect is a probable reduction in the livestock herd , especially hogs , which will have to be slaughtered because of reduced feed supply . In 1963 , after a more disastrous crop failure , the number of hogs dropped from 70 to 40 million . Meat boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market temporarily . But , to build up the livestock herd again , the country may have to import considerable amounts of feed grains in future , in addition to the wheat already bought abroad . The first of the recently-purchased Amer ican wheat is already arriving at Odessa and other ports . The difficulty of handling the approximately 28 million tons that the U.S.S.R. bought abroad this year probably means that part of it will still be in transit a year from now . The highest amount of grain that Soviet ports ever handled in one year previously was 12 million tons , in 1964 . The Soviet public has not yet been told of the purchase of American grain .
