If Mack Herron had carried a passport in his younger days , he could have listed his profession as loser . He majored in football at Kansas State , claimed that friction with his coach cost him a nomination for the Heisman Trophy , and quit school minus his degree . Pro offers were paltry , so Herron went to Canada . There he led the Canadian Football League in rushing but failed to awe the Winnipeg police . When they busted him for possession of marijuana , the Winnipeg Blue Bombers fired him . In 1973 he was back home in Chicago selling blue jeans for a living . <P> It was altogether fitting that when Herron finally got an N.F.L. offer , it came from the feckless New England Patriots . Though Herron led the league in kickoff returns and return yardage last season , the team ran up a discouraging record of 5-9 . But this fall Head Coach Chuck Fairbanks put Herron in the starting backfield , made a few other adjustments , and suddenly Boston was the cradle of rebellion against the N.F.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouncing the champion Dolphins , beat the Giants and for an encore knocked off the powerful Rams . Going into last weekend , the Pats stood tall as the only undefeated team in the league 's American Conference . <P> Standing tallest , at least figuratively , is Herron , the N.F.L. 's shortest player . A mere 5 ft. 5 in. but weighing 170 Ibs. , Herron has earned the nickname Mini-Mack from suddenly rabid New England fans , and new respect from befuddled opponents . " I realize it 's a big man 's game , " says Herron . " I use the big linemen as a shield . I stay real low , lower than I really am , so the defense do n't know where I 'm at . " <P> Undaunted and rarely located by bigger defenders , Herron knifed through the Ram defense for 38 yds. on one punt return that set up a field goal and led the Patriots in rushing yardage from scrimmage with 62 . The skittery running back , with legs like fireplugs and a gold stud festooning his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Coach Fairbanks admits that Her-ron 's reputation initially gave him pause . Now he credits Mack with " putting a spark in this team . " Quarterback Jim Plunkett , who has developed into one of the most effective tacticians in the N.F.L. this season , goes one step further . He calls Herron the team 's " catalyst . " In fact , Mack is just one of them . Plunkett has combined with College Teammate Randy Vataha for a crucial touchdown pass against the Giants and the game winner against the Rams . And Fairbanks has molded a three-linemen , four-linebackers " sponge " defense that has dampened opponents ' rushing games . Going into last weekend 's contest with the Baltimore Colts , the sponge had given up only two more yards on the ground than O.J. Simpson alone gained in his record-breaking 250-yd. game against the Patriots last September .
