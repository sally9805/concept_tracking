A special Ohio grand jury met quietly for almost a month in a country courthouse to appraise criminal responsibility for last May 's rioting and killing at Kent State University . Last week the jury found the National Guard innocent , indicted 25 others and accused the school 's administration of surrendering the campus to violent radicals through years of " laxity , overindulgence and permissiveness . " The findings brought from Martin Scheuer , whose daughter was one of the dead , the anguished response : " I have lost faith in justice in America . " Another slain student 's father , Bernard Miller , said : " You mean you can get away with murder in this country ? " <P> The legality of the shootings remains an open question , since federal action against some Guardsmen is still possible . But it was clear that some of the jury 's key conclusions conflicted in whole or in part with those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which made an exhaustive investigation of the tragedy , and the President 's Commission on Campus Unrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven , Police Chief James Ahern , a member of the Scranton commission , said flatly that the grand jury 's findings concerning the Guardsmen were " inconsistent with the facts . " On the Kent State campus , students held a peaceful rally and some were raising funds for the defense of those indicted . The names of the accused will not become known until this week , but they are expected to include students and nonstudent youths alike . <P> The 15-man special jury , sitting in Ravenna , six miles from the campus , heard more than 300 witnesses , and had available to it both the Scranton and FBI reports . The grand jurors saw what happened this way : <P> THE MAY 4 DEMONSTRATION . A noon rally on the campus common was held despite a ban ; orders to disperse were ignored and " caused a violent reaction ... It is obvious that if the order to disperse had been heeded , there would not have been the consequences of that fateful day . Those who acted as participants and agitators are guilty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scranton commission 's special report on ' Kent State - which noted that it was avoiding any assessment of guilt in order not to impede criminal investigations-called the decision to disperse the then peaceful rally " a serious error , " and the manner in which it was done " disastrous . " THE SHOOTINGS . The grand jury was critical of the Guard 's commanders at Kent State for placing their men in danger . But of the Guardsmen who actually did the shooting , the jury said : " They fired their weapons in the honest and sincere belief and under circumstances which would have logically caused them to believe that they would suffer serious bodily injury had they not done so . They are not , therefore , subject to criminal prosecution under the laws of this state . " <P> The FBI said that the shootings " were not necessary and not in order " ; the Guardsmen were not surrounded and not in real danger .
