Of all the body 's joints , the ankle is one of the most complex . It is an intricate hinge that not only supports the weight of the entire body but allows the foot to rotate and tilt through a range of angles . Doctors have learned to replace diseased or injured finger joints , hips , shoulders and knees with effective , man-made spares . But they have had only limited success with artificial ankles . In many cases the best they could do was to put in a hinge that allowed the foot to move only up or down . The accepted treatment for most patients with badly damaged ankles has been to fuse the bones , an operation that locks the ankle and radically reduces mobility . Now there is additional hope for patients whose ankles might otherwise have to be immobilized . A California physician has improved on earlier models by designing an artificial ankle joint that closely duplicates the action of the original . <P> No Pain . Developed by Dr. Theodore Waugh , 48 , an orthopedic surgeon at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint is a two-piece arrangement that weighs only five ounces . One part of Waugh 's " U.C.I , ankle " is an inverted T made of a chromium and cobalt alloy with a concave tip . The other part is an alloy half dome . <P> In an operation that takes a half-hour , Waugh makes an incision in the front of the ankle , saws off the top of the talus , or anklebone , and cuts a wedge-shaped opening in the bottom of the tibia , the larger of the two lower leg bones . He then inserts the metal into the tibia and fastens the dome to the talus . Each part is held in place with a special bone cement . The tension of the leg and ankle tendons holds the joint together and keeps the T in contact with-but able to move on-the dome . Most of the three dozen patients who have received the U.C.I , ankle ( Waugh performed 15 of the operations himself ) were up and walking on crutches five days after surgery ; many were walking unaided less than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation itself . <P> Hole in One . Waugh , who also developed an effective artificial knee joint three years ago , is currently working on a smaller version of the U.C.I , ankle for children . He will soon leave for Sweden to teach other surgeons his ankle-replacement technique , which may prove particularly valuable for dealing with severe arthritis . Says he : " One of the good things about this operation is that any competent orthopedic surgeon can do it without much problem . It should bring tremendous relief to thousands of crippled persons . " Waugh 's patients share his enthusiasm for the ankle , which costs $375 , plus the cost of the operation . Ben Lujan , 35 , a Los Angeles insurance salesman whose right ankle was immobilized after four operations to correct an old athletic injury , thought he would have to give up sports before he underwent an implant operation . " Letting Waugh put in the ankle was the best decision I ever made , " he says . Lujan has reason to be enthusiastic . Two months after surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his first hole in one .
