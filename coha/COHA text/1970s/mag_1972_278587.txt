It was to have been Munich 's gaudiest , bawdiest Fasching ever . In preparation for the pre-Lenten bacchanal that traditionally enlivens the gray Bavarian midwinter , scores of halls had been decorated with tinfoil , blinking lights , papier-mache figures of fun , and corners intentionally left dark . No fewer than seven carnival princes and princesses had been named , complete with courts and shapely girl guards . All was ready for Milnchner to abandon themselves , as they always had , to a month of drinking , swiving-judges do not consider adultery grounds for divorce during Fasching-and foolery unequaled anywhere else in Europe . <P> This year , though , the party has been a flop . The once glittering costume balls have paled in half-empty halls , and the extravagant costumes-and near nudity-of other years have given way to cliches of pirates , gypsies and cowboys . Munich 's hotel and restaurant association estimates that overall attendance is down by a third . <P> Toy Soldiers . Men complain that the girls have never been so unapproachable . Girls complain that the men do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kind of miss being pinched , " complained a voluptuous blonde in pink veils last week . Madeleine Schmidbauer , 22 , a winsome lieutenant in the guard of one of Munich 's carnival princes for the past three years , agreed : " Formerly , when we came down the ramp , marching in step , we prided ourselves on being toy soldiers everyone wanted to play with . Now people look at us with the same disdain as they look at the Bundeswehr . " <P> Why ? As the Fasching season neared its end on Ash Wednesday this week , there were myriad theories . People variously and contradictorily blamed high prices , fear of a recession , prosperity- " skiing in the Alps and sunbathing in Tenerife is more - fun " - or the mildest winter in memory , central heating , and the popularity of dieting . Marlene Kriiger , probably West Germany 's best-known astrologer , suggests that Fasching 's decline was caused by " the interaction of Uranus with the Jupiter-Pluto square in the Aquarian age . " Dr. Emil Vierlinger , a locally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap might be the reason : " Today 's young people celebrate Fasching all year long . Any mod store sells more . fantastic clothing , and they can dance more wildly and to louder music in any discotheque . " <P> Lost Uplift . None of the theories , however , explain why this year 's un-festive gloom clings only to Munich and other Bavarian cities . In the Rhineland , the freewheeling Karneval was going strong last week , as noisy and popular as ever . Tickets to Sitzungen ( cabaret entertainments ) were sold out ; dances were crowded , and in normally somnolent Bonn the federal government and city administration started closing down last week as celebrating civil servants took to the streets . Seeking to explain the difference , some Germans theorized that wine-drinking Rhinelanders are more lighthearted than stolid , beer-drinking Bavarians . Mimchner who did not accept that theory could take comfort from another explanation : that their city is more sophisticated than the industrial centers along the Rhine .               @ @ @ @ @ @
