txt Premier Golda Meir said today that Israel would continue to observe the cease-fire along the Suez Canal but would not participate in peace talks until there was a rollback of missiles from the cease-fire zone on the Egyptian-held side of the canal . At a news conference after a 90-minute meeting with President Nixon , Mrs. Meir 's manner was gentle but her message was tough : No negotiations are possible until the situation along the canal is restored to what it was on Aug. 7 , when the cease-fire came into effect . " I hope I have made that very clear , " she said . Mrs. Meir said that in conversation with the President and with Secretary of State William P.

Judging from her sanguine manner of the new conference held ? later at the Shoreham Ho- , tel , Mrs. Meir came away satisfied on that point . But if , as expected , Mr. Nixon tried to draw Israel back to the negotiating table without a rollback of the missiles , it seemed clear from the Premier 's remarks at the news conference that he had failed . She clung to the Israelis ' in ? sistence that the missiles must be removed first . Rejecting the notion that there had been a " crisis of confidence " between Israel and the United States in recent weks , Mrs. Meir said : " There was a misunderstanding , a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the canal since Aug. 7 .

" The Premier 's news conference came at the end of a whirlwind day of meetings , including two with Secretary Rogers at which the pending economic aid for Israel was discussed in detail . The 72-year-old Premier ooked somewhat tense as she began the day at 9 A.M. at the State Department . She seemed more relaxed , if fatigued , by the 4 P.M. news conference . For both appearances she was dressed in a two-tone cream and beige suit , black patent leather shoes and carried a pair of black leather gloves . Mrs. Meir was escorted throughout the day by Itzhak Rabin , the Israeli Ambassador to the United States who was the Israeli Chief of Staff during the six-day war in 1967 and by Simcha Dinitz , her political secretary .

While Mrs. Meir was receiving assurances of additional United States aid from President Nixon , a delegation of 10 Arab ambassadors was calling on Mr. Rogers urging him to forgo any material assistance to Israel . A spokesman said that the Arab envoys had voiced their concern over " what has been reported in the newspapers about supplying Israel with further arms and economic aid . " The New York Times reported this morning that the United States was considering providing Israel with up to $500-million in financial assistance to cushion the economic burden of both old and recent arms agreements .
