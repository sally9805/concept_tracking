THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE other day , as we were looking through the news , we came upon a graph that purported to describe the economic future . Its title was " The Hard Times Ahead , " and the source of its figures was the Ford Administration . Three lines  --  one for prices , one for the gross national product , and one for unemployment  --  traversed a white zone and then entered a pink zone . The white zone was the recent past ( the years 1971 through 1974 ) , and the pink zone was the near future ( the period from now through 19801 . The parts of the lines in the pink zone were as strong and reliable-looking as the parts in the white zone , and seemed to suggest that our knowledge of the future is just about as solid as our knowledge of the past . This confidence is new . Only recently have graphmakers and other technical experts added the weight of their prestige to predictions of human events . Just forty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artists . Sometimes , for instance , artists would render their idea of a city of the future . Three features that often recurred in these drawings stand out in our mind . First , the typical highway of the future looped and curved from skyscraper to skyscraper at the height of about thirty stories . Second , everyone was flying around in his own tiny , individual airplane or helicopter . Third , things tended to he enclosed in plastic bubbles . Sometimes a whole city was enclosed in a plastic bubble . All this was whimsey , of course . None of it came to pass . But a few decades later prophecy seemed to gain in respectability , and the study of the future came to he as solemn as the study of the past In an introduction to " The Year 2f100 "  - -  a study of the future by Herman Kahn and Anthony Wiener , of the Hudson Institute , which was published in 1967 ? Daniel Bell , the sociologist , looked hack condescendingly on the undeveloped state of futurolog ) in the first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these volumes , " he wrote , speaking of some earlier attempts to foresee the course of our century , " is their fanciful character , the personal and even prejudiced judgments , the airy and even comical tone , as if the idea of speculating about the future had a somewhat absurd but pleasant quality  --  in effect , a lack of seriousness . " The volume at hand , he suggested , contained weightier stuff . It took advantage of a " new sophistication in methodology , " he said , and went on , " We have begun to assemble statistical time-series both to plot trend-lines and to extrapolate likely developments . " Moreover , " we have begun to construct ' models ' or likely combinations of trends and developments in order to uncover the connections and causal relations between variables . " Using the sophisticated new techniques , rich with extrapolation and projection , Kahn and Wiener decided that the chances were good for a steady growth and development of what they called a " surprise-free " economy . By " surprise-free " they meant free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had been some of the sur-prises of the first half of the century . The surprise-free economy , in turn , would he part of an emerging " Stand-ard World , " or model world . The Standard World , they said , had been projected on the basis of an " op-timistic bias . " The surprise-free econ-omy , they thought , would contribute to the emergence of a " post-industrial so-ciety , " which would he characterized by " alienation amidst affluence . " Until recently , phrases like " alienation " and " post-industrial society " were on many people 's lips , and as we looked through Kahn and Wiener 's hook recently it seemed to us that they had put into words what many , and perhaps most , people in 1967 had tacitly assumed that the future would he . One difficult problem , the hook said , would he what to do with the large amount of leisure time that was going to he created when the trend toward increasing automa-tion  --  a subject of much discussion hack in 1967- eliminated the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The idea of moderately priced robots doing most of the housework by the year 2000 may be difficult to ac-cept at first , " they wrote , and they then quoted Meredith Wooldridge Thring , of Queen Mary College , in London , as recommending that " by far the most logical step is to provide a robot slave which can be trained to the requirements of a particular home and can he programmed to carry out half a dozen or more stan-dard operations ( for ex-ample , scrubbing , sweep-ing and dusting , washing up , laying tables , making beds ) when so switched by the housewife . " Another trend to which the technique of extrapolation was applied was the hippie movement of those days . Kahn and Wiener obviously did n't like it , but the way the lines were moving in their graphs compelled them to conclude that " the indolent spectator , the ' hipster , ' and the ' swinging cat ' would have become in large degree the norm for very wide sectors of the population . " What was worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome the downfall and dissolution of the American post-industrial way of life . " One small detail of post-industrial society mentioned in passing in " The Year 2000 " is " ' next-day ' delivery " of the mail anywhere in the United States . Now , not ten years later , it has all dissolved like a dream . The vision of a post-industrial society , with its alienation and its affluence , its leisure and its hipsters , its robots and its next-day mail service , has gone the way of the sky-high throughways , the swarms of tiny , individual helicopters , and the plastic bubbles . Surprises have sprung up all over the surprise-free economy . The Standard World has turned eccentric . The trials of scarcity and unemployment , not those of superabundance and alienation , preoccupy us . One thing that has survived , though , is the penchant for extrapolation and projection . Only today the bias is pessimistic . The models are models of collapse . The graph lines of the future that were going up in the Kahn-Wiener hook are going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the millennium but doom . No less an authority than the President of France has told us that " the great curves that describe the future in our times all lead to catastrophe . " We have even developed a taste for disaster , and the movie theatres offer more than a few varieties of calamity for our delectation . An uncertain present unanticipated by any of the predictions of just a few years ago has given birth to a new tragic vision of the future which is a mirror image of the earlier optimistic one . It is as though each present now arrived equipped with its own future  --  a future that was suited to its special needs , and that could he thrown out as soon as the needs of a new moment asserted themselves . For all our preoccupation with what lies ahead , we fail to give the real future its due . It is larger and more astounding than we think . In it are lines that do not appear on our graphs , shapes that are not shown in our drawings . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bursts all the models , and is unlike anything ever foreseen by man . ? ? Of and Running LON BOTSTEIN , violinist , conductor , historian , who four and a half years ago , when he was twenty-three , became the youngest college president in the country , up at Franconia College , in the White Mountains , has just been named president-elect of Bard , a venerable liberal-arts institution in Annandale-on-Hudson , and is still , no doubt , the youngest college president in the country . Edgar Hatfield , chairman of the Bard board of trustees , who says he has the longest tenure of any college trustee in the country  --  some forty years  --  threw a reception and lunch for Botstein at the University Club recently . At this affair , the word " energy " was often used to describe the president-elect . The Right Reverend Paul Moore , Jr. , Episcopal Bishop of New York and a Bard trustee , said , " What a lot of energy that young man has ! It 's the one quality I look for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey , one of five Bard undergraduates who served on the committee to find a new president , told us , " The thing I liked about Leon was his energy . We must have screened about two hundred candidates  --  we put an ad in the Times  --  and personally interviewed at least forty , and after a while they almost all began to seem identical to me . They 'd all written something , they 'd all been to school , they all had some connection with a foundation . Leon was different . " In his four and a half years at Franconia , Botstein got the college fully accredited , doubled the size of the student body , quadrupled the size of the library , built a million dollars ' worth of new buildings , and recruited a large squad of new faculty members . After the lunch , Botstein came up to our office for a few minutes and gulped a Coke while we nursed a Tab . " I 'm thinking of commissioning the composer George Crumb to write a piece for my inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn-rims , three-piece brown herringbone tweed suit , blue-and-white shirt , and maroon tie . " Last summer , we helped organize the White Mountain Music and Art Festival , and I conducted the Beethoven Ninth , Haydn 's ' Nelson Mass , ' the Brahms Violin Concerto , and the Mozart Clarinet Concerto , with Benny Goodman as soloist . I am very much looking forward to Bard . What are my thoughts about it ? I think we have to rethink what a coherent undergraduate education would look like . It seems to me that some portion of college time needs to he devoted CO pre-vocational training , so that kids get some sense of specialization and acquire something that is going to he useful to them when they arc living their lives . ' If this is so , what kind of general-education program is it worth a college 's while to offer ? The old gen. - ed. programs were either purely elective  --  and thus brought students only to things they were already curious about before entering college  --  or else very specified . I 'm particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed off by complications that liberal-arts students are being castrated by the lack of technical expertise . The average college student has no idea how a computer works , how a strategic-weapons system is set up , how DNA works . The old Horace Mann-Robert Hutchins argument  --  that education is necessary for democracy  --  falls apart . And the old problem remains : Kids come out of high school needing to know how to read , how to write , and how to think . I think we need to create scientific literacy  --  teach them how to teach themselves about what scientists are doing these days . " Another good question is how to integrate the arts into a liberal-arts education . I think we can ask students " Well , here it is . The ideal girl for you is five foot four ; 36 , 26 , 36 ; a real looker , with an M.A. in literature , a sunny disposition , a terrific sense of humor , and a love of good music  --  classical or jazz . " to learn how to do art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means singing , painting , and dancing , instead of just being able to take a date through a museum and distinguish a Manet from a Michelangelo , which is only useful for the social consumption of culture . I 'm an incurable optimist , and I think everyone 's got a little talent . " A third aspect of education  --  this is from the sixties is what we have called at Franconia community-service education . At Franconia , students are designing and building , under professional guidance , a local high school , and other students arc editing the only newspaper for prison inmates in New England . A lot of vocational training takes place in a vacuum , but if it can he of service to a constituency other than the college itself , kids can see some practical value in knowing some skills , and can participate actively in something other than their own private lives . Students are notoriously private now , you know . I think community-service education makes resident college living more legitimate . " I also would like to see more emphasis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask students to read Great Books and soak up the accumulated wealth of mankind , regardless of who gathered it , or when , or under what circumstances . Students are profoundly ahistorical now , and I think they need to work out the notion of how their own environment , over time , has shaped their lives . " And I want to think Some more about what it means to live in dormitories . We have a beautiful campus at Bard , nice Facilities , a good staff , and a small endowment . I could have stayed at Franconia , and I could have taught at a universim But I 'm delighted to be here . And the only other thing I want to Say is that I do n't think being a college president is a vocation at all , so I probably wo n't spend a lifetime at it . " The Black Dragon WFIEN we went to see " The Black Dragon " on Forty-second Street the other day , it was , according to Variety , the nineteenth-top-grossing film in America , doing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film ) but not as well as " Amarcord " ( the eighteenth-topgrossing film ) . Then , just after we saw " The Black Dragon " on Forty-second Street , a new Variety came nut that did n't list " The Black Dragon " et aP . From nineteenth-top-grossing film to obscurity . " The Longest Yard " was still listed ( had moved up to eighteen ) , and So was " Amarcord " ( moved down to twenty ) , but " The Black Dragon " was nowhere . Serafim Karalexis , the co-producer of " The Black Dragon , " has explained this to Us . " I have one hundred prints working , " he told us . " At some times , they are playing the major cities that Variety samples . At other times , they 're not When they play the Variety cities , we get listed . Otherwise , forget it . " Variety is most accurate when it samples the grosses of major films released by major producers . Serafim Karalexis is not a major producer . Mr. Karalexis ( who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student at Boston University ) is an independent producer . He shot " The Black Dragon " in the Philippines in eight weeks for an amount he says was " over one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . " When Variety last reported on the film , it estimated a gross to date of eight hundred and fourteen thousand dollars . " It 's absurd to guess , but the film could gross maybe a coupla million , " Serafim Karalexis said . " I started it nut in Detroit . Then I moved it all up and down the Eastern Seaboard . Now I 'll take it down South and out West . With a film like this , you localize it . You take it to an area and keep playing it till you 've got nothing left . " When we saw " The Black Dragon , " it was localized at the Harris Theatre . The Harris has its charms . For instance , the ticket-taker , unexpectedly , wears a crisp blue uniform , a starched , stiff shirtfront , and a white how tic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Harris Theatre looks like a slightly shopworn Wedgwood soup bowl . We went to see " The Black Dragon " with a friend of ours named Gerald , who knows a lot more about martial-arts movies than we do . Gerald told us what to expect from the Black Dragon himself . " Now , the Black Dragon is a kung-fu roaster , " lie said . " He 's at a different level from the other people . See , a kung-fu master will he one of the kindest people in the world . He 'll he the kindest person you 'd ever want to meet , " Gerald explained that , despite their kindness , kung-fu masters , when provoked , sometimes snatch out the heart of an opponent with one kung-fu stroke . Gerald also said that because of their restraint and kindness there was generally only one kung-fu master in each martial-arts movie . " if they made a movie with all kung-fu masters , " he said , " it would be boring , because they 'd just be meditating . " Gerald explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to rile the master up to the point where he 'd fight . This happened right of in " The Black Dragon . " The Black Dragon , working on the docks for an ominous sort of export company , intervened when a duck boss began to beat a fellow-worker . When the boss began to beat him , he tried at first not to fight . " I 'm sorry , " the Black Dragon said . THE NEW YORKER " See , it 'd take a whole lot to make him angry , " Gerald Said . The dock boss continued to heat the Black Dragon . " He 's still not angry , " Gerald said . The dock boss continued to heat the Black Dragon . " He 's angry now , " said Gerald . The Black Dragon , with a series of impressive chops , reduced the dock boss and several other dock bosses to misery . " Well , my young friend , " said the boss of the dock bosses to the Black Dragon , surveying his shattered crew , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses offered the Black Dragon a job . The Black Dragon accepted . The Black Dragon signed a contract by drawing a picture on it . " See ! ' " said Gerald . " He ca n't read or write , but he signed the contract . I do n't know what that contract says , but there 's probably something wrong . " There was something wrong with the contract , but it is not possible to describe with an accuracy the rest of the plot . It involved these elements : ( 1 ) A scene in which the Black Dragon saves a girl from pia ? stitution and wins her as a friend , ( " The Blick Dragon wo n't go with a girl , " said Gerald. ) ( 2 ) A quiet , almost idyllic period . ( " They always play funny music , like Clar ; stmm music , " said Gerald. ) ( 3 ) Lots of inaccurate dubbing . ( " You see them rip up the paper , but then the sound comes afterward , " said Gerald . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosses and the hired fighters of the bosses . Gerald said that he enjoy cd " The Black Dragon " ? especially , he said , the roundhouse kicks . Numbers and Resources IN the bedshcet trade , we learned the I- other day , a set of sheets and pillowcases that arc supposed to go together is called a " number , " and a company that sells numbers to department stores is called a " sheet resource . " We also learned that Americans spend nearly a billion dollars a year on numbers . This last must be a dependable fact , because we heard it from no fewer than three highly placed sheetresource sources , all of them executives of Springs Mills , Inc. , in less than an hour of champagne sipping and cucumber-sandwich nibbling . We collected this little harvest of information at a showing of sheets and whatnot designed by Bill Blass , who also designs coverings for people , both male and female . The showing took place in a large room at Springs Mills ' corporate headquarters , on West Fortieth Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible to locate . Young female employees wandered here and there , wearing blank expressions and floor-length gowns made of Bill Blass sheets . Bill Blass was there , looking every inch the successful , red-blooded American fashion designer  --  white teeth , blue eyes , square jaw , suntan , graying sideburns . He was wearing a Donegal checked suit , suede vest , wool tic , and golf shoes . None of that ethereal French nonsense . Mr. Blass told us that there used to he a great need for masculine patterns in hedsheets , a need that has now been attended to . By way of illustration , he showed us a bed with sheets on it that had a pattern resembling a herringbone suit viewed through a microscope . " Of course , I have flowers , too , " he said . Then he showed us a bed with flowered sheets . The three sheet-resource sources were James Perkins , John Sawhill , and Nick Milos . Mr. Perkins told us that Springs Mills was the first sheet company to bring out a designer line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a great relationship with Bill Blass , because his merchandise sells , and that 's the name of the game . He 's a very-easy-to-work-with person . " Mr. Milos wore a dark-blue suit , and there was something familiar about his tie . " It 's the uniform of the day , " he said . " It 's the same pattern as the ' Shadows ' line that Blass did for us . I had to wear my sincere suit , because nothing else goes with it . " We then talked with Mr. Blass and Mr. Sawhill . Mr. Sawhill said , " We have four different styles in this show . At our first Bill Blass show , in 1971 , with the ecological impact , we had six different styles . " " What was ecological about the impact ? " we asked . " Who the hell knows ? " Bill Blass said " Oh , yes , we had a cloud . " " And the Japanese garden , " Mr. Sawhill said . " And the Paisley pattern , suggesting the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that one , " MI . Blass said .
