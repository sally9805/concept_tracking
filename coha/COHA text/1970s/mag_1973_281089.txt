Going into the fourth Sunday of the season , the Atlanta Falcons had lost two consecutive games without scoring a single touchdown . They seemed to be on the brink of disintegration . The San Francisco 49ers were winning 10-0 , and now a disgruntled home-town crowd had to watch the embarrassing spectacle of two Falcons-Fullback Art Malone and Tight End Jim Mitchell-angrily slapping each other around after a muffed play . The fight symbolized the Falcons ' frustration better than any statistics of futility on offense or defense . <P> No Falcon was more frustrated than Bob Lee , a tall freckle-faced redhead . At 28 , Lee had been an N.F.L. quarterback for four years , but had started in only eleven games . He came to Atlanta from the Minnesota Vikings confident that he " could win the starting job . " But a training-camp injury slowed him down , and Coach Norm Van Brocklin went with well-traveled N.F.L. Veteran Dick Shiner . <P> When Shiner was hurt in the 49ers contest , Lee was the man Van Brocklin turned to , and he promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though the Falcons lost once more ( 13-9 ) , Lee somehow seemed to have turned them into a team . The next week , with Lee still calling signals , Atlanta buried the Chicago Bears 46-6 . The Falcons have been soaring ever since . Going into last weekend , they had won seven in a row and were challenging the Los Angeles Rams for first place in the Western Division of the National Football Conference . <P> The difference is largely Lee . He can be a deadly drop-back passer , picking zone defenses apart with consistent accuracy , or a slippery scrambler . In sending the Vikings to their first loss of the season , Lee left defensive stalwarts Carl Eller and Alan Page grabbing air time after time until his receivers had the opportunity to cut into the open . Since taking over the Falcons , Lee has hit for ten touchdown passes while completing 56.6% of his throws . <P> Just as important , Lee has lifted Falcon morale . Originally nicknamed " Howdy Doody " by Van Brocklin , Lee is now called " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with infectious enthusiasm before the team huddles and after he calls the plays ( all sent in by Van Brocklin , a former quarterback ) . When Lee is tackled he hops up off the ground and claps again . " I 'm not afraid to admit it when I 've made an error , " he says in his low-key way . His teammates appreciate that style . " Lee never eats us out when he gets sacked , " marvels Offensive Tackle Bill Sandeman . " He simply tells us , ' Let 's get it together , guys . ' " <P> Aside from the suddenly explosive offense , the guys have got together a formidable defense that is anchored by End Claude Humphrey . " We 're just a good young ballclub that is maturing , " says Lee , who has matured quite a bit himself from the days when he watched pro football in San Francisco , where he grew up . While a teenager , he worked as a part-time Associated Press sports reporter and diagrammed plays for his high school team . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , quite unexpectedly , they may find that their general has a chance to do battle in the Super Bowl .
