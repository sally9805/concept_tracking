KONRAD LORENZ : A BIOGRAPHY <P> by ALEC NISBETT 240 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $10 . <P> Alec Nisbett , a physicist and science writer , plainly had ample access to Konrad Lorenz , the ethologist and author of the widely read books King Solomon 's Ring and On Aggression . But Nisbett seems to have been overawed by his subject . As a result , he has failed to write a critical study of Lorenz and his work . Instead , he has produced an informative Festschrift . <P> The facts are all here . Nisbett 's interviews with Lorenz reveal the great man to be the son of a dominant father who wanted him to study medicine rather than zoology . They show how Lorenz managed to mollify the old man by doing both and by sharing a Nobel Prize for Medicine . <P> Nisbett 's book also describes Lorenz 's remarkably symbiotic marriage to his wife and collaborator Gretl and relates , in great detail , the studies upon which he based his books and theories . Lorenz , in the course of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goslings , spent apparently interminable hours observing jackdaws , fish and other animals before developing his hypothesis that overcivilized modern man lives in a state of moral decay . <P> But this book reveals relatively little of Lorenz himself . Nisbett fails , for example , to follow up on a particularly tantalizing tidbit of information about Lorenz 's pragmatism . When Doctoral Student Lorenz realized that his examiner had not read his thesis and was firmly committed to existing ideas , the founder of ethology smoothly switched tracks and gave the answers that were expected of him . Nor does Nisbett discuss Lorenz 's now regretted papers that appeared , in the early 1940s , to support Nazi race theories . <P> Nisbett 's problem is at least partially understandable : Lorenz , an impressive-looking figure at 73 , is not only alive and well but perfectly capable of raising quite a ruckus over any statements , in this book or others , that offend either his sensibilities or his sense of moral purpose . <P> PINK COLLAR WORKERS <P> by LOUISE KAPP HOWE <P> 301 pages .

For non-college-educated women , Bea 's predicament is not uncommon . According to Louise Kapp Howe , the odds are overwhelming that what such women do is vastly undervalued . To assemble her disquieting portrait of the work life of the average woman , Howe interviewed scores of women , met with unions and management and even took a job as a sales clerk . The vast majority of women , she writes , are in " pink collar " occupations : beautician , office worker , sales clerk , waitress . Among the problems contributing to their generally low wages : too many applicants and not enough jobs , indifferent unions , and company policy predicated on " A and P " ( attrition and pregnancy ) to hold down the office payroll . Wherever she can , Howe skillfully animates dry statistics with the experiences of women who are figures in a job world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
