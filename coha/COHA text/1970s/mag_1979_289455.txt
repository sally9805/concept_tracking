AN ALMOST PERFECT AFFAIR <P> Directed by Michael Ritchie <P> Screenplay by Walter Bernstein and Don Petersen <P> <P> To anyone who has not been there , the Cannes Film Festival sounds like paradise : free movies , bountiful booze , great food and beautiful people all converge under the sunny skies of the Cte d'Azur . Would that it were so . In reality , the festival is a grotesque trade fair . The few good movies are mobbed ; the best restaurants are overbooked ; traffic jams glut the countryside ; it often rains . The festival celebrates money , not art , and only the industry 's hustlers seem to have fun . For anyone else , a day in Cannes is like a week in Vegas . <P> No wonder , then , that the Cannes Festival is a perfect subject for Director Michael Ritchie , a satirist who has previously assaulted such institutions as competitive sports ( Downhill Racer ) , beauty pageants ( Smile ) , political campaigns ( The Candidate ) and est ( Semi-Tough ) . For his new film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 festival to record the goings-on in all their vulgar glory . He eavesdrops on the manic deal making that transpires daily on the Carlton Hotel terrace , the pretentious black-tie screenings , the endless parade of female pulchritude for commercial purposes . Such real-life luminaries as Rona Barrett , Edy Williams and Brooke Shields pop up here and there , in most cases to make spectacles of themselves . <P> Unfortunately there is more to Affair than Ritchie 's delicious documentary footage . The backbone of the film is a fictional liaison between Hal ( Keith Carradine ) , a precious young independent director , and Maria ( Monica Vitti ) , a married , middle-aged movie star . When this odd couple first start fooling around there are some amusing cross-cultural jokes , as well as touching erotic interludes in dreamy Riviera locales . But the affair quickly becomes a high-toned soap opera that devours the movie . By the end , the hero and heroine are adrift at sea in a stalled motorboat , screaming platitudes at each other . The scene looks like a parody of Lina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Banality aside , the love story suffers from Carradine 's performance . Once more he is playing the corruptible innocent he already created in Nashville and Pretty Baby . This humorless characterization has calcified : instead of being boyishly naive , Carradine is just pompous and prim . Certainly he is no match for Vitti , who has rarely seemed as radiant and emotionally full-blooded as she is here . With smoky eyes and a voice to match , she reduces her co-star to the stature of a lap dog . <P> As Vitti 's wronged husband , a flamboyant but sympathetic producer , Raf Vallone is so appealing that it is hard to know why Vitti would forsake him . Whether he is arguing on the phone about Burmese distribution rights or comforting his wife in a time of need , the serpentine Vallone is a grand old charmer . We want to see more of him , but once Affair shifts from satire to bathos he fades away . There are too many such missed opportunities . Like other visitors to Cannes , Michael Ritchie arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot why he came in the first place . <P> - Frank Rich
