The quintessential , slightly hoarse upper-class Manhattan honk , Tom Wolfe once theorized in New York magazine , can only be produced by the proper Eastern boarding schools , too many cigarettes over too many years and a great deal of whisky and gin . New York 's founding editor Clay Schuette Felker , 51 , attended a public high school in Webster Groves , Mo. , has never smoked and rarely drinks anything stronger than cambric tea . His accent remains stubbornly and glottally Midwestern nasal . He flunks the honk test . <P> Nonetheless , Felker 's weekly Almanac de Gotham lays down standards of aspiration , acceptance and rejection as rigid as any set by Louis Quatorze . Along with genuinely useful " urban survival " features , it gives the insecure a superior feeling of being inside , offering them a blend of fact and fantasy . It portrays an unreal stream-of-consumption world whose Gucci 'd , Pucci 'd denizens glide between Parke-Bernet ( the t is not silent ) and La Grenouille ( the maitre d 's name is Jean ) , send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maarten or Gstaad , summer in the Hamptons , patronize the priciest boutiques but also thriftshop , and know exactly where to find the best buys in catered canaps , scuba lessons , English butlers , conversational Italian , take-out lasagna , abortions , exterminators , ' 76 Beaujolais , yachts , docks , clocks , stocks , rocks , lox and woks . Also rijsttafel , macram and dog psychologists who make house calls . With all this , plus extramarital affairs to save their marriages and therapeutic sex with their shrinks , New York 's New Yorkers lead busy , busy lives . <P> Clay Felker , the creator and curator of this ineffably rewarding world , screams a lot . He insults people . He falls asleep at dinner parties . His wispy , graying locks go uncombed , his custom-made Savile Row suits look as if they had been bought at a manufacturer 's fire sale-they do not disguise his paunch . He is variously described by associates and acquaintances as autocratic , devious , dishonest , rapacious , egotistical , power mad , paranoid , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same people call Felker a genius . " He 's always been tough , restless and driven , " says George A. Hirsch , now publisher of New Times , who quit as publisher of New York after four years of corporate karate with Clay . When New York was still struggling for survival , he adds , " Clay would pace the room , hyperventilating as he does when he 's excited , and say , ' I think there 's a great chance for us . Maybe we can take over ABC or Time Inc . I do n't know how it 's done , but I know they do these things . ' "
