As Ronald Reagan prepared to launch his campaign for the presidency , TIME National Political Correspondent John Stacks and West Coast Correspondent Joseph Kane interviewed him at his home in Los Angeles . Their report : <P> With a fortune of well over $1 million , Ronald and Nancy Reagan live comfortably in an elegantly furnished , five-bedroom ranch-style house in Pacific Palisades . In the living room , the grand piano is covered with mementos of show business days , photographs of Old Friends Frank Sinatra , Bob Hope and Edgar Bergen . On the end tables are small glass dishes filled with the jelly beans that became his trademark as Governor . They are intended for guests . To keep down his weight , he rarely eats them now . Reagan is dressed casually , in slacks , a blue V-neck sweater and velvet slippers embossed with back-to-back gold Rs . <P> No matter how much his campaign advisers have tried to moderate his image , at heart he is still the romantic conservative he has always been , glorying in the strength and goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fantasize what it would be like if everyone in Government would quietly slip away and close the doors and disappear . See how long it would take the people of this country to miss them . I think that life would go on , and the people would keep right on doing the things they are doing , and we would get along a lot better than we think . " <P> Reagan calls the national campaign trail the " mashed potato circuit , " and he has been wandering along it for 15 years . Says he : " I have a feeling now that I do n't get on planes . I get up in the morning and put them on , like a pair of pants . I wear them . In show business we used to say that if you do n't sing or dance , you wind up an after-dinner speaker . " <P> He was Governor of California for eight years , and he believes that somehow Government by the people has been snatched away from them . Says he : " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past few decades . . . was a tendency to have increasing Government by an elite , and those at the Government levels believing that they had to make the decisions more and more regarding how business and industry are run , interfering virtually in every one of our lives . And they are doing this to a people who for 200 years have probably been the most independent and most individually free people in all the history of mankind . <P> " Oh , Government is a legitimate function , " Reagan adds . " When I talk about regulations , I always use the words ' unnecessary regulations . ' I do n't want medicines that could destroy our health instead of helping us . But then Government goes beyond that protection thing , and they start trying to protect us from ourselves . " <P> More generally , Reagan blames Washington for turning Americans against one another . He says : " We have seen politicians in recent decades set people apart . They have helped to create special interest groups , whether on racial or religious lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , whatever ; and they have done it for selfish political reasons . Then they can appeal by giving or offering a promise to one group that they 'll get special treatment . They are appealing to envy and greed and pitting one group against another .
