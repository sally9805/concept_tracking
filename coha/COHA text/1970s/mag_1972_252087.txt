SHE does n't walk onstage . She insinuates herself . Rotary-drive hips , and fingers that were probably snapping out rhythms in the cradle . Overstuffed bosom beneath a Pucci dress , $450 shoulder-length brown wig , and eyelashes long enough to rake a lawn with . She coolly surveys the scene and lets fly with a sassafras falsetto : " Whoooo-eeeee ! Watch out , honey ! Do n't you touch me ! Do n't you ever touch me ! " Or : " When you 're hot , you 're hot ; when you 're not , you 're not . " Or her trademark : " What you see is what you get . " <P> Nobody who watches television needs to be told who she is . She is Miss Geraldine Jones , the No. 1 character of TV 's No. 1 comedian , Flip Wilson . Geraldine and her creator are like nothing that has ever appeared on a top-rated weekly variety hour . It is not simply that both are black , although that is significant enough . It is that Geraldine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterization comes from the clichs of the black experience that she embodies , the other half from put-ons of conventional white attitudes toward that experience . Five years ago , any network executive worth his Valium would have sworn that these were not the ingredients of mass entertainment . <P> Like Flip Wilson , Geraldine represents a fresh twist on traditional themes . The name is borrowed from a childhood crush of Flip 's , a little girl in the grimy ghetto streets of Jersey City . The personality owes something to Sapphire , the endearingly bossy housewife on the Amos ' n ' Andy radio show of the 1930s and ' 40s . The voice is derived from the Delta screech of Butterfly McQueen , the eye-rolling , stereotyped black maid in Gone With the Wind , and of so many other Hollywood oldies . What is different and up-to-date about Geraldine , says Flip , is that " she demands respect . She is not a loose woman . She always has some meaningful employment , and she 's never asking for favors . Geraldine 's liberated-that 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stuff . " <P> For that matter , none of the characters that Wilson plays take any stuff . " Like Geraldine , they 're all in complete control , " says Flip . " They 're all alive , exciting , and in tune with whatever is in . " There is , for example , the Rev. Leroy of the Church of What 's Happening Now . The Rev , as Flip calls him , is a hot-gospeling preacher whose collection cup runneth over-into his pockets . There is Freddy the Playboy , the swinger with a quick eye for an ebony leg and an even quicker line of honeyed jive . There is Sonny , the White House janitor , Henry Kissinger 's Doppelganger and the only sane voice in the Washington Establishment . <P> Narrative Gift . On his show , as well as on his records , Flip Wilson spins out these impersonations in anecdotes , not one-liners . His gift is for dialect and narrative , not gags . The laugh track of a Bob Hope or a Milton Berle is a crescendo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills and valleys , zigs and zags . He puts his material over gently , through sheer likability-and considerable body English . Though only 5 ft. 6 in. , he has an amazingly elastic physical grace , and a repertory of motions that recalls the masters of silent movie comedy .
