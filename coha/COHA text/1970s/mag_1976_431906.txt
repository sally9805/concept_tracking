 | A Time to Weep There seemed little else for those of us in the audience to do when Helvi Sipila , highest ranking woman at the United Nations , broke down during her luncheon address , except to express sympathy through our applause . It was at the 1976 Congress of Presidents sponsored by the editors of Good Housekeeping to initiate , they said , " a continuing discourse on Women in Passage . " Mrs. Sipila had flown in from Argentina that morning . She was obviously tired and suffering from the inevitable jet lag . But what had caused this usually composed woman to falter in her speech and have difficulty in controlling her voice was the fate of Isabel Peron . Mrs. Sipila and her party were the last people from outside Argentina to meet with Mrs. Peron on the night of her arrest by the military junta which took over the government . Mrs. Sipila had tried to tell us about it . " There we sat , " she said , " the two women who had reached the highest positions women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , but President of her country ; I was the highest ranking woman in the United Nations . To the wonder of the people there we talked about what it meant to be women in these positions . " She could not continue . The woman next to me was scandalized . " How could she feel that way about Isabel Peron ? " she asked me . " The woman was a disaster for all women . And she certainly invited her own fate . " But I think what moved Mrs. Sipila ? and the rest of her speech bore me out ? was the realization surely borne in on her at that early evening meeting in the Presidential Palace with Isabel Peron . It was the terrible , shaking realization that no matter how far each had risen , no matter . what each had been able to do , it was , on her part , at the sufferance of men and , on Mrs. Peron 's part , by men 's political use of her . Whatever their differences ? surely they are many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have shared a mutual recognition of the relative helplessness a powerlessness of even the in highly placed women in what still very much a man 's world . " All the decisions about planet are made by one sex , " Mr. Sipila was to say later , " decisi about population , about f about mass poverty , about the between the poor and the rich nations , about illiteracy , chi morbidity , unemployment , at about the environment ? about th very air we breathe , the food we eat , and the water we drink ! " The other sex ? ours ? are but passive recipients of these decisions , she told us . Helvi Sipila 's topic , as announced in the program , was " Women : An International Perspective . " Her whole elaboration on it was as blunt and as uncompromising continued on page 57  | the above statement . The siton of women in the world today bleak , she said , and getting raker . Seventy percent of the women in the world are in countries we call " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are women . Illiteracy is increasing , for variety of reasons , among women . This means that millions of children ca n't even be taught the most rudimentary of things by their mothers . lions of women in the world are undernourished . One billion of : e women live in the least developed countries . There they are carriers of water and the gatherers of fuel . In most of these countries they are charged with the growing , preparing and storing of food . Thus , most of the world depends on subsistence farming by run by women . When food is short , women suffer more because they tend to sacrifice for their children , and their own are less valued by the communtity as a whole . la more than one-third of the world , women are at the lowest levels of responsibility and pay and deprived of their legal rights to wire property or to dispose of it ell as their personal and prop- ? rights ? including the property to their own persons , to choose a spouse , to choose not to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women been , and are , a silent majority an active but invisible one . The extaordinarily active participation . ' women in the world has seldom been recorded . Theirs is the under : of history . Mrs. Sipila was forthright with r women hearers , who represented : st of the major women 's organizations in the United States . Women he developing countries have no r ; or energy left over to address inequities of their situations . Meanwhile , " she said , " millions of men here in volunteer organizaos work in splendid isolation ? tiding time and energy in a spesphere called women 's world . " Ic time has come to work with - . The total world community is state of crisis and of imbalance , d will be that way until the imi.ince between the sexes which , rives the world of the creativity work of half the population is corrected .
