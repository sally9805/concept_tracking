TIME 'S James Willwerth visited him in prison and reported Blyden 's tale of his continuing war with the law : <P> " May I see your identification , please ? " <P> He stands alone before the visitors ' table , looking down with defiant , dark eyes . He is a big man , with broad shoulders , hard features , shaved Muslim head hidden by a blue stocking cap . A dark scar runs from his left cheek to his ear , from a " cutting " two years ago . His rust-colored cardigan is open and reveals a ring on a brass chain . Satisfied with the press card , he says , " They look for excuses to play with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X.
