" A honeymoon , " says China 's leader of his search for aid and allies <P> March on , brave people of our nation , our Communist Party leads us on our new Long March . Millions as one , we march , march on ... <P> The strains of the Chinese national anthem sounded first last week on the south lawn of the White House , as summit protocol demands . Then the U.S. Army Band gave an equally rousing version of The Star-Spangled Banner . From a windswept podium on the crest of the low hill , the two leaders exchanged bland welcoming remarks , then mounted a balcony to acknowledge the applauding crowd of some 1,000 dignitaries . Suddenly , Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-p'ing departed from the traditional script . He impulsively grabbed Jimmy Carter 's hand and held it high . They looked like a pair of politicians just nominated by a national convention , and there was little doubt about which man thought he was running at the head of the ticket . <P> No gesture better captured the spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . After surviving purges back home , setting his country on a quick-step march toward modernization , and winning diplomatic recognition from the most powerful nation in the West , Teng could be forgiven for indulging in a moment of triumph . His trip to Washington was the first ever by a top-ranking Chinese Communist leader , and it added a personal normalization of relations between the two countries to the diplomatic normalization that took effect on Jan. 1 . <P> Washington responded by staging the most fervent welcome for a foreign visitor since Nikita Khrushchev came calling in 1959 . Showing few signs of his 74 years , Teng rushed through a formidable schedule of official and semiofficial events . He talked for 5 hours with Carter , dined at the White House , lunched with Senators and U.S. reporters , sampled American culture at the Kennedy Center and barnstormed across the country , getting a firsthand look along the way at American enterprise : a Ford plant near <P> Atlanta , the Johnson Space Center in Houston , a Boeing plant outside Seattle . <P> It will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . At the very least , his tour marks a dramatic new phase in the relationship between the two giant nations , a phase symbolized last week by the signing of scientific and cultural-exchange agreements , by the prospects of greatly increased trade and of another summit conference in China later this year . Over and over , Teng made it clear that he is urgently looking for American credit and technology to modernize his backward nation . The early signs are that he will get much of what he is seeking . <P> But in this sudden flowering of Sino-American friendship after 30 years of hostility-including three years of bitter warfare in Korea-there lie serious dangers of increased instability in the East-West balance of power . Teng was amply provocative in his warnings that " the danger of war comes from the Soviet Union , " and Carter , perhaps unwisely , joined him in a new denunciation of " hegemony , " which the Chinese define as Soviet expansionism .                   @ @
