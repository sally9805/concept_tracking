There is a fair chance that future historians may credit-or blame-Alex de Renzy , 34 , an imaginative San Francisco pornographer , for bestowing the coup de grce to movies ' last remaining sexual inhibitions . De Renzy went to Denmark with a camera crew last year and shot endless reels of 16-mm. film of the country 's legal pornography industry . The resulting Pornography in Denmark takes sexploitation as far as it can go . The picture explicitly depicts lesbianism , fellatio , cunnilingus , and every detail of conventional sexual intercourse . <P> The film has now achieved more or less legitimate distribution in Los Angeles and Manhattan , where it plays under the alias Censorship in Denmark : A New Approach . In San Francisco , de Renzy took the movie from what he jokingly calls his " sleazy lust house " in the tenderloin to a theater in the respectable Marina district . " We just could n't fill up the theater with sex freaks , " says de Renzy . " We are pitching to a much broader , middle-class audience . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the $15,000 venture has grossed some $800,000 in half a year . <P> To circumvent censorship , Porno , as the film is known , is passed off as a documentary . Clumsily interspersed with the sex scenes are travelogue footage of Denmark and man-on-the-street interviews of the queues entering Copenhagen 's 1969 Sex Fair . Police vice squads have raided Porno-once in Los Angeles , twice in San Francisco-but courts have refused to close the show . Another censorship dodge , used by many of de Renzy 's competitors in the fast-expanding porno market , is sex education . Such how-to-do-it movies as Man and Wife and Marital Fulfillment clinically demonstrate the positional permutations of coitus . Few if any of the pictures released so far in either genre are particularly erotic . Depicting sex that is crude , loveless and even passionless , they are really horror movies-repellent not so much for their immorality as for their inhumanity . <P> Amateurs Only . " I 'm not exactly sure where it belongs , but pornography has a place in society , " argues de Renzy . Before coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nevada , taught at an Air Force survival school , worked as a croupier in Reno , and shot industrial films in San Francisco . After moonlighting on stag movies , he leased a 50-seat lust house that he renamed The Screening Room . He spent $50,000 refurbishing and expanding it and as much on legal fees fighting police efforts to close it down . Since 1968 , the box-office gross has risen from $100 a week to an average $8,000 . To attract repeat patronage , de Renzy shoots a new 90-minute picture every month or so , and his cinematic technique is improving with practice . At first his stars were prostitutes , but he now casts only amateurs , generally hippies ; he gets them for $50 a picture through an ad in the underground Berkeley Barb . <P> Adjusting to affluence , de Renzy drives a Porsche convertible and sails a 52-ft. yacht . He lives in a $150,000 hilltop estate in Marin County-with his secretary and one of his former actresses . Both are pregnant with his children , and he supports at least five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " that I 'm on a sex trip .
