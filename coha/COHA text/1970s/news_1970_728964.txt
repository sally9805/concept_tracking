Cullerton singled out the owners of the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Daily News building for criticism . Ile said that in stories charging him with giving unwarranted reductions in valuation to political supporters , the newspapers failed to mention that the SunTimes building received " a reduction in assessed value because of economic hardship . " Tax Factor Reduced Johnson said the Sun-TimesDaily News building first was assigned a tax factor of 89 per cent but has since been reduced to 77 per cent because a tax attorney complained of excessive wear and tear and other depreciation . The Field office building , 135 S. La Salle st. , formerly owned by the Marshall Field estate , received tax breaks before and after Cullerton took office , Johnson said .

In 1969 , when the warehouse was completely occupied , the rate was reduced from 90 to 75 per cent . The reduction was granted , he said , " because the building was not in full use . " As was to be expected , the Sun-Times and Daily News reporters demanded to know about THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE and Chicago Today buildings . The crossfire of questions from all of the reporters prevented Cullorton 's release of it before Cullerton and McCracken terminated the conference to attend a funeral . Shows Tribune Files Johnson later produced the CHICAGO TRIBUNE-Chicago Today file . Quoting Johnson : " There are two property records cards on file relative to Tribune Company property . 1 . Tribune Tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assessed at 56 per cent in comparison to a book figure of 60 per cent .

" If they 're entitled to relief and can prove it , they can get it for economic reasons , " he added . Accuse Adamowski During the conference Cullerton and his aides accused Adamowski of mishandling his contingency fund while state 's attorney .

" The result of the Investigation was that in 1968 the IRS gave my wife and me a refund of $323 which Uncle Sam owed us. "
