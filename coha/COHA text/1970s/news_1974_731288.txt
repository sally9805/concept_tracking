txt On the west side of the town of Warren , Pa. , sits an empty , out-of-business service station that until a couple of months ago sold Keystone petroleum products . According to Bud Whitton , manager of United Refining Co. ' s Keystone marketing division , the premises underlying the decision to close the station were simple . It was " a real dog , " he says , and " what you 'd call a typical marginal outlet " He adds : " It 's been through all kinds of dealers in the last few years , and it 's been a salesman 's nightmare . " Thus did the Keystone station join thousands of other idle gasoline outlets across the country , the great majority of them victims of overexpansion in petroleum marketing during the 1950s and 1960s and , more recently , the gasoline shortages that put the final squeeze on many marginal outlets . And thus did it seem likely that the empty Keystone station would become a slowly decaying eyesore , its windows shuttered with plywood , its parking areas strewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means inevitable . For in Warren , Pa. , one man 's nightmare is proving to be another man 's golden dream , that latter man being one Sam Manfray . During the past 13 years , Mr. Manfray has been making small quantities of sausage in the back room of his grocery store in nearby Ludlow . Lately , he decided to expand his sausage-making operation to " maybe 2,000 pounds a week . " The upshot : He 's negotiating with Keystone to acquire the lease for the defunct station , where , he says , " there 's plenty of room for my stuffers , grinders and linkers , built-in plumbing and washrooms and lots of parking space . " If this thing takes off , " Mr. Manfray continues , " maybe I could franchise it . There sure are lots of other empty stations around to expand in . " High Mortality Rates Petroleum industry sources estimate that anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 service stations were closed during 1973 , up sharply from about 4,000 in 1972 . ( There are currently 200,000-odd service stations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets operating a pump or two as a sideline . ) Both private-brand marketers and branded service stations have had high mortality rates . In many cases , these abandoned stations have simply been left to the elements . But in a growing number of cases , the fact that the idle property is often prime commercial land is prompting many types of firms and individuals  --  like Sam Manfray and his sausage operation  --  to consider buying or leasing the service-station sites for conversion to uses other than petroleum marketing . " There 's an awful lot of these conversions going on now , and you 're going to see even more in the near future , " says Mr. Whitton of United Refining , which controls 635 active stations in Ohio , Pennsylvania and western New York . He notes that " most of these ( abandoned sites ) are in prime business areas where you 've got good traffic density plus a parking area and building already there . " Mr. Whitton adds that gasoline-station conversions are " nothing new , it 's just that today they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , is that in the past , stations tended to be converted into rather obvious and often automobile-related uses , such as car washes and used-car lots . But as for today 's conversions , he says , " we 're seeing some pretty weird ones . " X-Rated Outlet Certainly , the conversions have variety . An ex-service station near Southfield , Mich. , is now screening pornographic movies . Another , outside Rochester , N.Y. , houses a volunteer fire department . A station in Springfield , Mo. , has been turned into a Baptist church , One in Colorado Springs , Colo. , is currently a cat hospital . The firm that has perhaps profited moat from the plentiful supply of abandoned stations is Mr. Donut of America Inc.1 a division of International Multifoods Corp . Last year , 15 of the doughnut chain 's 50 new outlets were rehabilitated gasoline stations , and a spokesman says " we expect to acquire and convert a minimum of 30 stations this year . " Mr. Donut , which currently has 825 outlets across the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service station to a working doughnut outlet , compared with $115,000 to 3135,000 to purchase land and build one from  --  the ground up . Also , the chain has found that conversions can be completed in about a month , instead of the three months it takes to build a now facility . The soaring cost of rental space in commercial office buildings is also causing individuals and firms to eye the stations with interest . In Jamestown , N.Y .. Dr. Harold Glazer was advised that the rent for his downtown business , Union Optical Service , would jump from a current 3500 a month to $1,200 a month starting next year . So a few weeks ago he purchased an abandoned service station for $18,000 . " I think it 's a good bargain , " Dr. Glazer says of the station , which is four blocks away from his present location . " I figure it will cost about $40,000 to remodel it , and then I 'll have my own building for my business , along with parking for about 35 cars . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have paid for itself , and I 'll have equity in it . " Inevitably , real-estate agents are discovering the lucrative potential of the onetime service stations . As a case in point , Clyde Smith , who owns an industrial and commercial real-estate firm in Harrisburg , Pa. , recently mailed out letters to all the major oil companies , seeking to buy their abandoned outlets . " There are literally hundreds of closed stations around here , " Mr. Smith says , adding that " now is the time to buy them . They 're sitting around like white elephants , so we 're bargain-hunting to get these eyesores out of the community and put them into productive use . " One community that would certainly favor such conversions is Hempstead , N.Y . Alfonse D'Amato , town supervisor of the Long Island community , says , " We 've got 74 abandoned stations on our hands now , and the bulk of them sprang up in the last sour or five months during the energy crisis . " He says that this total represents about 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most of the closed stations " have become a blight on the community . They attract vandalism , abandoned cars and all sorts of garbage . " Consequently , Hempstead recently passed an ordinance whereby service-station owners must sell , demolish or convert their buildings within eight months of closing them ; in cases of noncompliance , the town says it will bulldoze the property and bill the owner for the bulldozing costs . The flurry of conversions and the potential profitability of the converted operations has n't been lost on the major oil companies , several of whom say their real-estate divisions are currently examining alternate uses for defunct stations . Sun Oil Co. has even come up with a contest to encourage graduate students at Syracuse University 's School of Management to dream up inven tive and practical uses for abandoned outlets . The entrant with the best submission will be awarded $1,000 when the contest is judged later this month . Another source of ideas has been concerned citizens , some of whom are suggesting that service stations be converted to meet their area 's particular needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposes transforming local abandoned stations into methadone clinics or " satellite medical screening centers . " The latter use , he says , " would be a great way to handle chest Xrays , innoculatians , preventative medicine and even minor surgery , like gunshot wounds . " ( Whatever alternate uses are being found for the stations , their huge underground gasoline tanks are ultimately useless , since , for safety reasons , most municipalities require that they be removed or filled with sand or cement shortly after the outlet is abandoned . ) While the spate of conversions is expected to continue for some time , the number of stations to be deactivated this year is n't expected to be as high as in 1973 . Oil company officials say much of the deadwood has already been weeded out of their operations , and they say the elimination of marginal outlets provides a bigger share of the market , and therefore more chance of success , for the stations that are left .                 @ @ @ @
