For middle-class families , food-price inflation means discomfort ; for the American poor , it can mean outright hunger . Spending up to 60% of their income on food , the poor consume the most basic of diets and can not " spend down " by substituting cheaper items when the cost of their regular diet goes up . Worse , the foodstuffs that they eat much of , such as rice , flour and dried beans , have risen even faster in price than meat and butter , which the middle class eats more of . The price of dried beans , for example , has leaped an astounding 256% since December 1970 , while rice has jumped 124% . As a result , the nation 's needy are hungrier now than they were four years ago , despite the billions of dollars poured into federal food programs . <P> That was the most sobering conclusion after three days of hearings held last week by the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs . The committee five months ago asked Harvard 's Jean Mayer to assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly domestic and global food problems . Mayer 's group of roughly 100 reported last week at unusual hearings split into two panels : one group of Senators , headed by Committee Chairman George McGovern , heard the international report ; another group , led by Democrat Walter Mondale of Minnesota , listened to the domestic report . <P> In the U.S. , one panel asserted , the Government 's food-stamp program to feed the needy has failed so badly that " no amount of revision can ever enable it to solve the problem . " Inadequate assistance payments and poor administration are major troubles . Many poor people do not know that they can get the stamps ; in fact , only 35.7% of the 37 million Americans eligible for the stamps now receive them . Many of the poor who do not get them have been reduced to buying pet food as a source of protein . <P> The Mayer group recommended that the U.S. establish a minimum-income floor for all families-an idea that McGovern failed to sell in the 1972 presidential campaign . <P> The foreign report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa and Asia , has literally eaten up all the increased food output achieved by poor nations over the past decade , leaving their citizens as ill fed as ever , the experts found . To bridge the gap , McGovern recommended that the U.S. set up a $20 billion " Plowshares for Peace " program that would build stockpiles of food for needy nations to draw on . That is another idea that seems unlikely to be adopted : Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz , who will present the Nixon Administration 's proposals for solving world food problems to an international conference in Rome in November , has already turned thumbs down .
