Allegheny Airlines sounds like the name of a puddle-hopping carrier that serves a mountain range in Pennsylvania . But to the heads of the nation 's major trunk lines , Allegheny appears as a fire-breathing imperialist swallowing up lesser lines and challenging the giants for airspace . Though it is still classed as a regional carrier , Allegheny in the past five years has grown to become the sixth largest airline in the U.S. in passenger traffic . Its revenues have nearly quadrupled to $265 million , and profits have risen to $6,000,000 last year from a loss of $5,000,000 in 1967 . The acquisition of the financially troubled Lake Central airlines in 1968 and Mohawk Airlines last year has given Allegheny a route system that embraces 70 cities from Memphis to Montreal . <P> This year , President Leslie ( " Les " ) Barnes has added a few more cities to the list of destination points for Allegheny passengers : London , Paris , Rome , San Juan . In order to acquire them , Barnes had to tie up with yet another ailing carrier : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's but has lost $150 million since 1968 . The two lines are not actually merging-at least not yet-but they are offering one-week , single-ticket , group tours to Europe and the Caribbean for residents of 16 cities served by Allegheny . Customers fly from their home towns via Allegheny to a major " gateway , " like New York or Boston , then board a Pan Am plane for the overseas hop . Sample price : $310 round-trip plus at least $70 for ground accommodations from Dayton to London for one week , v. as much as $520 economy air fare alone for Dayton-New York and New York-London tickets purchased separately . In addition , Pan Am clerks in London , Paris and Rome will act as Allegheny ticket agents for overseas passengers who want to go on to , say , Detroit after getting off a Pan Am plane at a port of entry . <P> Barnes first suggested the get-together last year , but Pan Am Chairman William Seawell may benefit most from the symbiosis . Pan Am , which has no significant intra-U.S. routes , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but merger talks with Eastern , United , TWA and Braniff have all fallen through . Now that Seawell 's economies have begun to push Pan Am toward profitability , Allegheny 's Barnes sees the two lines as made for each other . They stand to capture as much as $500 million a year in additional revenue by offering single-ticket service to passengers who live in cities served by Allegheny and fly to Europe or the Caribbean . Since the tie-up is so far much looser than a merger , Civil Aeronautics Board approval has not been required . <P> Barnes also has his eyes on other skies . Allegheny has applied to the CAB for routes to Los Angeles , Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta . If he can get routes to Atlanta from Detroit , Cleveland and Cincinnati , Barnes pledges to forgo Allegheny 's annual federal subsidy . In return for flying into such small cities as Danville , Ill. , and Johnstown , Pa. , where traffic does not otherwise support commercial service , Allegheny collected $3,200,000 from the CAB last year .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
