When you are the first Republican mayor of your city in three decades , and , what is more , Democrats there outnumber Republicans 8 to 1 , it behooves you to run , at the very least , a shrewd re-election campaign . Cleveland Mayor Ralph J. Perk has been doing just that , and last week he won 56% of the vote in the nominating primary against Millionaire Democrat James M. Carney. * Perk took office two years ago , succeeding Carl Stokes and changing the tone of city hall from soul food to sauerkraut . To unseat him , Carney , an attorney and land developer , seemed an apt choice-a moderate white who represented both black and business interests and commanded the resources to run an estimated $100,000 campaign . Perk spent hardly any money on advertising ; instead , he capitalized on-and deepened-his personal popularity and purposeful ethnic Bunkerism . Perk did well in the white wards ( where he won 79.8% of the vote ) , and Carney performed well with blacks ( 84.1% ) . <P> What was not expected was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites . By contrast , Perk 's showing among blacks was impressive . When he ran in 1971 , Perk got less than 4% of the black vote . This time he received a respectable 15% . Perk seems a sure winner in the general election in November , where he will face Carney again . <P> * To avoid multiple candidacies in the general election , the two top votegetters in Cleveland 's non-partisan primary automatically go on to face one another in the general election , even if one of them receives more than 50% of the primary vote .
