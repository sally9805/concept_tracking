Harper &; Row . $6.95 . <P> The narrator of this small first novel is a nameless American Indian . 32 years old , " servant , " as he describes himself , " to a memory of death . " He already has plenty to remember . His older brother died at 14 , crumpled by a car while trying to drive cattle across a Montana highway . After years of " making white men laugh " at local bars , his father failed to come home one night . He was later found frozen " stiff as a slat " in a snowdrift . The narrator thinks that something has died in him as well ; he feels " no hatred , no love , no guilt , no conscience , nothing but a distance that had grown through the years . " <P> So he sleepwalks through chores on his mother 's land and binges in neighboring honky-tonks . He falls in with a scheme to spirit an eccentric white man across the Canadian border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the keys to the car that was to be his payment . He is bloodied in a brawl . Then another death ensues , that of his ancient grandmother . She had once been the third wife of a revered - and defeated - Blackfoot chief . Watching her die , the grandson learns something of her heroism and finds another survivor , his own grandfather , to link him to the tragic past of his people . <P> The vision is brief , its echo swal lowed by Montana 's vast emptiness . But it reveals that the hero 's feigned indifference to life is a sham . He inwardly craves all the things to which he has tried to close his heart : love and loyalty , and a purpose that will root him to the land his forebears lost . Near the book 's end , he tries to rescue a cow that is in danger of drowning in mud . The task is mock-heroic , emblematic of the best he can expect from existence . But he struggles furiously , engaged in the grubbiness of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicism . <P> Novelist James Welch , 34 , neatly juggles despair and hope ; the book 's sur faces convey both a sad seediness and a tumbledown vitality . Himself an Indian ( Blackfoot and Gros Ventre ) , Welch lives on a 40-acre farm outside Missoula , Mont. , where he is now at work on a second novel . Whites , he feels , tend to be too sympathetic or too harsh when they write about Indians . " We do n't have those obstacles . To us , being an In dian is home . " With remarkable force , Winter in the Blood brings its experiences home to others . Its prose is as dry and tough as pemmican . It turns a long historic outrage into a short , relentlessly unsentimental elegy .
