As Masai herdsmen looked on in horror , the inevitable finally occurred last week : the first fatal crash of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet . Seconds after takeoff from Nairobi , Lufthansa Flight LH 540 en route to Johannesburg shuddered violently , then sank tail first from an altitude of less than 200 ft . Lufthansa reported that for reasons still not clear , the leading-edge wing flaps were not in the extended position after takeoff . Thus , the aircraft did not have enough wing lift to climb . <P> The accident was not the massive disaster it might have been for an elephantine airplane with a capacity of 361 passengers . Fortunately , only 157 people were aboard . Of that total , 59 died ; they had sat in the plane 's rear section , which struck the ground first . But 98 persons survived . <P> The 747 was one of 237 in commercial service . Since the jumbo jet began flying almost five years ago , it has carried 75 million passengers a total of 193 billion passenger miles . By comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before suffering its first crash in which passengers were killed . Other commercial planes , while extremely safe , also have not done quite so well as the 747 . Even with the Nairobi tragedy , it still holds the most impressive safety record in aviation history .
