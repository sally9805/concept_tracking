1 EXT . SUNSET BOULEVARD - OVERHEAD SEQUENCE - EXTREME HIGH SHOT - DAY MOVING OVERHEAD , we FOLLOW a blue VOLVO snaking down Sunset Boulevard . It turns south and enters the regular pattern of West L.A. streets . The erratic Volvo captures our attention : it drives too fast , too slow , never in the flow of traffic . An ORANGE VAN accelerates out of a 4-way stop , and SCREECHES to a halt , barely missing the Volvo . We FOLLOW the orange van as it continues through the intersection . At the next corner , the van turns left . We FOLLOW . The orange van pulls up to the next corner , another 4-way stop . The blue Volvo , having turned right , speeds past . We now PICK UP the Volvo again , FOLLOWING it down a side street . The Volvo accelerates ; its speed approaches 40 mph . The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY TO REVEAL that the blue car is speeding down a dead end street  --  headed directly toward a concrete block building . The Volvo gains speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just before impact , the Volvo screeches its brakes and swerves left . In time to avoid the building , but too late to avoid impact . The Volvo CRASHES full speed into a chain link fence next to the building . The SCREEN GOES TO BLACK . CUT TO : CREDITS 2 INT . BATHROOM - NIGHT OR DAY A young woman 's face appears out of the darkness . She has large dark eyes , dark hair and delicate bones .  --  3  --  Her name is DIANNE CRUISE . She is a lovely young woman whose step into age 32 has brought her an inner glow , though life 's anxieties have accompanied her like a shadow . She examines her face in the mirror . The MIRROR IS THE CAMERA . Without makeup , she has a sickly pallor . Her eyes are expressionless , her long hair disheveled . She tries rubbing the dark circles from under her eyes . She traces a wrinkle-line across her forehead . Still expressionless , she takes a scissors and slowly cuts her hair at the neckline . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if from FAR AWAY , we HEAR a SCRATCHY 45 RECORDING of " You Belong To Me " ( 1962 ) by the Duprees : " YOU BELONG TO ME " See the pyramids along the Nile , Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle , Just remember , darling , all the while , You belong to me. FADE TO : END CREDITS . 3 INT . BEDROOM - DAY Dianne 's bedroom is in a state of beginnings and endings . Boxes of things to be THROWN OUT stand near the door , contrasted by colorful bags of NEW merchandise waiting to be opened on the bed . There are containers of fresh flowers but no plants , animals or other signs of co-habitation . Dianne pulls a suitcase from under the bed . She moves some of the packages aside , sits on the bed , opens one of the bags and pulls out six new pairs of bikini underwear which she puts into the suitcase . A map of the United States lies on the bed . A red line runs across the country mid-section . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She folds up the map and puts it in her suitcase .

Dianne reaches through a stack of books : COLETTE , AMOR AND PSYCHE , CANDIDE , HAYWIRE and THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER to get to the bedside phone . She dials a number and pulls more things out of the bags : perfume , soap , a lightweight plastic raincoat , some packets of flower seeds .

PANNING DOWN we SEE " Cormear Chevrolet " in the f.g . Beside it the San Diego Freeway . There are cars everywhere . Immersed in a sea of automobiles , we SEE Dianne talking to a SALESMAN who is dressed in colorful drip dry . He wears a plastic lei around his neck , as Cormear is having its annual Hawaiian jubilee . He is pointing to a bright red sports car . Dianne 's hair is recut attractively just above the shoulders .  --  5  --  She is very intent on getting the most for her money . The Salesman nods his head like an understanding pharmacist in a mouthwash ad . &nbsp; DIANNEHow about something reliable that wo n't break down ? Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; SALESMANI 've got just what you need  --  He turns and walks a good way away from her and stops at a blue ' 73 Dodge with $2495 painted on the window . &nbsp; SALESMAN ( continuing ) This little beauty has 25,000 original miles , comes with a three month/3,000 mile warranty on major parts and labor and a baby orchid lei . &nbsp; DIANNEI 'd like to look under the hood . &nbsp; SALESMANSure .

Dianne takes out her wallet and smiles .  --  6  --  &nbsp; DIANNEI 'll pay cash .

Dianne drives around them and parks . The others climb out of their cars and make their way to their favorite pick-up bar in town . She waits for a moment and then opens the door , gets out , and goes inside . CUT TO : 19 INT . WANDERING PALMS A TRIO PLAYING the " countrypolitan " sounds of John Denver stand in one corner of the room . There is a lot of wood , brass , stained glass , plants and NOISE . The place is packed . There is a tiny parquet floor for dancing , a TV set over the bar with the SOUND TURNED LOW and a SIREN that GOES OFF EVERY NOW AND THEN for no apparent reason . Everyone there is robust , tan , healthy-looking , cute , handsome , groovy and seems to be a graduate of EST . Everyone there is also on the make . Dianne stands near the door for a moment to get her bearings . Conversations overlap and intertwine . A continuous trail of bad jokes moves through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey Wallbangers , pina colataes , Glass Slippers and other fruit-filled drinks . Dianne moves into the clutch and eases her way to the bar . She cases it thoroughly . Someone at the bar finally pays and leaves , so she sits down . &nbsp; BARTENDERWhat 'll it be ? She answers , but the SIREN GOES OFF and obliterates her request . &nbsp; BARTENDER ( continuing ; yelling ) What ? &nbsp; DIANNE ( yelling ) Seven over Seven , with ice .  --  12  --  A SKIER sitting next to her turns around and looks at her squarely . &nbsp; SKIERHi .

The Bartender hands her a drink and a napkin and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replace themselves with a JUKEBOX full of quarters . Dianne sips her drink and looks down the long mirror over the bar . She scans the row of faces . About three quarters the way down she sees who she came to Colorado for , the man from her diary , JEFF TURRIN . He is telling a long story about rebuilding the door on his house to a couple of the crew beside him . He is sunny and funny and the men enjoy his story even though they 've heard it before . A stool , one away from him , empties . Dianne picks up her glass and moves to it quickly . Before she can sit down , someone grabs her arm . It is a YOUNG MAN in a leisure suit and turtleneck . &nbsp; FREDCan I buy you a drink ?  --  13  --  She pulls away from his grasp and edges onto the seat . She sneaks a look at Jeff in the mirror . He 's looking in the mirror at that moment . They connect for a second and then turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DIANNEToo late . &nbsp; FREDOh. . . you 're sure ? &nbsp; DIANNEI 've never been more sure of anything  --  Fred walks off .

She jumps and he starts to laugh . When the NOISE DIMINISHES A LITTLE , he speaks to her in the mirror . &nbsp; JEFFFighting ' em off tonight ? Dianne pretends not to hear . She shrugs at his image and then tries to get the Bartender 's attention . He is busy at the moment . She looks up at the mirror , Jeff has turned his back to it . Dianne calls to the Bartender again . &nbsp; DIANNEExcuse me  --  Jeff has moved to her side . He seems to recognize her , but  --  not quite sure  --  keeps silent . &nbsp; JEFF ( to Bartender ) Jerry , Jerry  --  would you bring me another drink for . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice .

( he takes a sip of her drink ) God , that 's awful . &nbsp; DIANNEI know . &nbsp; JEFFJerry , bring her a scotch . He smiles and looks at her for a moment . Dianne smiles at the Bartender as he gives her the scotch . She is engagingly elusive . She looks at Jeff as she takes a sip of her scotch . &nbsp; JEFF ( continuing ) What are you doing up here ? &nbsp; DIANNEI 'm on vacation .  --  16  --  &nbsp; JEFFAre you married ? Dianne avoids any direct eye contact for the moment . &nbsp; DIANNEUh-huh . &nbsp; JEFFMe , too . &nbsp; DIANNEOh . &nbsp; JEFFWhat do you do ? &nbsp; DIANNEAh . . . I teach sociology at L.A.

We LOOK at Dianne for a moment before we HOLD ON Jeff 's reaction . CUT TO : Section Details 20 EXT . WANDERING PALMS - NIGHT Dianne and Jeff walk out of the Palms and through the parking lot .

RODEWAY INN ROOM - NIGHT The inside of Dianne 's motel room bears a great resemblance to her room at home . The television is on , but the sound is off . A portable TAPE CASSETTE MACHINE PLAYS MUSIC . Dianne has brought all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states of being packed and unpacked . She is in front of the mirror anxiously trying on various combinations of clothes . At the moment , it 's one of many layers  --  a long skirt , boots , oversized sweater , poncho , belt , scarf around her neck and earrings . She speaks to her image . &nbsp; DIANNEHey  --  yeah  --  that 's right , I mean you , honey . You wan na come over here and jump on my bones ? You wan na fuck me till my ears ring ? Dianne looks at herself .  --  19  --  She shakes her head , disgustedly . This is definitely not her style . She takes off the belt , boots and scarf . She wipes off her lipstick , hollows her cheeks by putting on some dark blush and ties the scarf around her head . She touches her lips delicately with her fingertips and looks imploringly into the mirror . &nbsp; DIANNE ( continuing ) Well , I do n't feel very well . . . you know what I mean ? Rather faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop by for a second . . . She backs away from the mirror and shakes her head again . &nbsp; DIANNE ( continuing ; to herself ) You 've got to be kidding . She pulls off the scarf , takes off the skirt  --  she has jeans on underneath  --  puts the boots back on and takes off the oversized sweater . Underneath the sweater is a bright red pullover that fits . She reapplies the lipstick and wipes off some of the blush as she talks to the mirror , softly . &nbsp; DIANNE ( continuing ) Let 's just go to a motel , all right ? We 'll go to a motel and make love all night . We ca n't lose . . . not you and me  --  what do you say . . . ?

Cars come and go . She has parked in a place that is very difficult to find . CUT TO : 23 INT . DIANNE 'S CAR - NIGHT Dianne looks at her watch and takes a piece of gum from her purse . As she does this , we HEAR her , VOICE OVER , reading again from her twelve year ago diary . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 21 ) Finally , it happened . Jeff Turrin asked me out . He loves movies , so we went to see a foreign film  --  L'ECLISSE by Antonioni. We SEE several cars enter the lot as Dianne pops the gum in her mouth . One of the cars drives back and forth through the aisles of parked cars . Dianne 's V.O. continues . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than the Kierkegaarde assignment .

The NARRATION PICKS UP OVER Jeff 's reply . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 21 ) God , I really like him , but I sure do n't think much of his selection of movies . Part of him is serious , even scholarly , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass moves just like Mick Jagger . I just wish he 'd bathe more often. &nbsp; JEFFAre you hungry ? How about a movie ?

Jeff carries a bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label . Dianne turns on the lamp as Jeff pours a couple of straight shots into the saran-wrapped plastic glasses . Both of them appear casual trying to play down the importance of the liaison . He starts to remove his coat . &nbsp; DIANNEWait  --  let me do it . Let 's do it the way we used to . He stops and looks at her for a moment . They begin to undress each other , slowly , carefully , everything orderly , almost ritualistically . Jeff pulls back the covers on the bed and the two of them slide into the coolness . They do the last stages of undressing under the covers . As they begin to make love , we HEAR the HARD ROCK INTRODUCTION to something like " I Ca n't Get No Satisfaction " coming from the room next door . Jeff starts to laugh . &nbsp; JEFFOh , motels are sure hells The angels wo n't sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dianne laughs and speaks back to him , but the V.O. COMES UP .  --  23  --  &nbsp; DIANNEMy legs parted like the Red Sea And he found his Israel in me . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 21 ) Sweet Jeff . God , he 's shy about undressing but not when he makes love . He reaches in and takes me right out of myself . We use our bodies to escape and we have " that kiss , " like in the movies , that kiss that 's everything . I wish I was in love with me the way Jeff is . I 'll always love him for letting me soar. They laugh and as the MUSIC PLAYS ON they make love , opening the way for a vulnerability that both of them have set aside for some time . 25 INT .

A cold edge comes over Jeff 's voice .

Dianne borrows the Johnny Walker . She takes a drink . They are quiet for a moment . &nbsp; DIANNEI know the feeling . &nbsp; JEFFThis may sound cruel , but I think it 's better if they die . You can hate what killed them . Not yourself and each other . At least you can start over . Dianne looks away . &nbsp; JEFF ( continuing ) I 'm sorry I said that .  --  25  --  &nbsp; DIANNEThat 's okay . &nbsp; JEFFShe moved out in March and a window broke in the kitchen .

INDOOR POOL - DAY We HEAR the SOUND of a TEACHER 'S WHISTLE . The WHISTLE SOUND CONTINUES as , in LONG SHOT , we SEE five or so young bodies caught mid-dive , entering the pool lanes for a timed relay . There is a lot of YELLING and CHEERING from a rather enthusiastic group on the sidelines . While the young people in the water swim at a startlingly fast rate of speed , several coach types walk around in sweat suits , their eyes riveted to their stopwatches . A group of doting parents hang around on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 28 ANGLE We WATCH Jeff and Dianne walk the long distance through the ECHOING SOUNDS and SPLASHINGS on the clear size of the Olympic size pool . They approach the starting position as five more swimmers strike the water and the first five drag themselves out of the pool . Five more swimmers get ready to replace the ones that just left . Dianne gets caught up in the activity and watches with a certain amazement at the incredible skill of the swimmers , whose age range is from 9 to 15 . Dylan stands dripping wet and yelling encouragement to her teammate who is about to touch the side . The last set of swimmers explode off the edge and the spectators ' NOISE LEVEL RISES to meet the new speed exhibited by those youngsters .

He pushes open the small fence and walks down the sidewalk . This is LEWIS . CUT TO :  --  80  --  72 EXT . LUDINGTON - DAY Lewis , wearing jeans and a checkered shirt , walks down the sidewalk . Dianne , on foot , follows him at a safe distance . They walk past several small businesses . Out of the upstairs window of one we HEAR an out of tune PIANO PLAY " East Side West Side " for a tap dancing class . We HEAR the teacher 's VOICE call out  --  " Flap , shuffle , ball  --  change " on top of the MUSIC and TAP . Below is a body shop where Lewis has stopped to talk to one of the men who works there . After a moment , Lewis moves on , stopping next to read a magazine in front of the drugstore . As Dianne continues to follow , we HEAR her voice over . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 13 ) Lewis moves like the panther in the Chicago Zoo . I love to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace . " His friends kid him because he hangs out with me . But he said not to listen to those drips. Lewis passes a cluster of schoolgirls . He looks at them for a moment and continues across the street . His walk has the air of a young dog 's seemingly aimless ritual . Dianne follows him across the street and into the supermarket . CUT TO : 73 INT . SUPERMARKET - DAY Once inside the market , Lewis pulls a shopping list out of his pocket and looks it over . He looks up once as Dianne enters , sees her but goes back to his list . The sunlight directly behind her diffuses her features . Dianne , on the other hand , is shaken . The ever increasing voice from her past and the present reality of Lewis make her slightly faint . She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror . Unused to the new length of her hair , she takes a closer look as Lewis grabs a metal cart and turns it into one of the aisles . &nbsp; DIANNE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a woman . I went and found Mom in the kithcen . When I told her I needed a Kotex she did n't know what to do , even though she had them waiting on the shelf for six months . I wonder if Lewis will see the difference. &nbsp; MANExcuse me  --   --  81  --  Dianne turns around sharply . She expects to see Lewis . She expects that he has recognized her at last and has come to claim his long lost love . It is n't Lewis , just a man who has bumped her accidently with his shopping cart . Dianne is too stunned to answer . She looks around desperately for Lewis . &nbsp; DIANNE ( softly ) Oh boy  --  She moves around so she can look down the aisles . She sees Lewis pass by with the cart at the far end of the store . She walks to that end of the store and then turns in time to see Lewis pass by in the center aisle . She looks at a WOMAN who is trying to keep her three whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; WOMANYou know anybody who 'd like to buy ' em ? &nbsp; DIANNE ( lying ) They 're lovely . Lewis wheels the cart past them to the check stand . She walks toward it stopping to grab a pack of gum as she goes . Lewis is being checked out as Dianne gets caught in a crush of shoppers . Then Lewis walks out the door  --  Dianne , stuck in the line puts the gum back , runs to catch up to Lewis . CUT TO : 74 EXT . SUPERMARKET - DAY Dianne stands outside in the parking lot looking frantically in all directions at once . Lewis is nowhere in sight . CUT TO : 75 INT . STEARN 'S HOTEL HALL - DAY We HEAR the VIOLA PLAYING as Dianne walks to her door and unlocks it . As she goes inside the MUSIC STOPS . As she shuts the door , the door next to hers opens and the man in the soft tweed hat exits and runs down a flight of stairs . CUT TO :  --  82  --  76 INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window of Dianne 's rooms we SEE Lewis ' house . In a moment we SEE the fellow from next door walk to a car , unlock it , reach inside , close the car door and start back inside the hotel . At that point , Lewis passes him on the street , his arms loaded with groceries . He is eating an apple . We HEAR the SHRILL RING of the TELEPHONE next door . It startles Dianne but she continues to watch Lewis . He crosses the street . The PHONE next door STOPS . In a moment the VIOLA STARTS UP again , PLAYING an entirely different piece of music . We continue to WATCH as Lewis pushes the gate open , walks up the stairs of his house and disappears inside .

We 're doing a marketing survey and would like to ask you some questions . You do n't have to give your name . Just answer a few simple questions . Lewis gives an indifferent shrug . &nbsp; WAYNEOkay . There 's not a glimmer of recognition in his face . Dianne waits  --  still he does n't recognize her .

Boxed into a bookcase niche , like a Japanese tokonoma , are selected artifacts : an official Marine Corps photo , a folded tri-corner U.S. flag , a medal and a framed letter of condolence from the White House .

( points to auto wrecks ) This used to be all lilac bushes . &nbsp; WAYNEIt 's the junk yard . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 13 ) Then we kissed and I knew it was a special place . Dianne 's voice fills with anticipation as she looks ahead : &nbsp; DIANNEI wonder if it 's still here . &nbsp; DIANNE ( V.O. ) ( AGE 13 ) And then I was special . I was n't like the other girls . I was happy and beautiful . She leads Wayne up the old path alongside the creek .

They stand under the arbor . &nbsp; DIANNE ( looking around ) This was it . All the trees have grown . But this was definitely the place . She looks around the arbor . It 's still a Secret Place , but the secrets it keeps have changed with the time : beer cans , cigarette butts and ripped pages of pornography are strewn among the leaves and pine needles .  --  103  --  Dianne can hardly breathe she is so caught up in her mysterious anticipation . She feels very close to something , perhaps the secret is hidden here . She turns and looks at Wayne . He is very uncomfortable . His hands tremble . &nbsp; DIANNE ( continuing ) Are you okay ? &nbsp; WAYNEI do n't know . Perhaps because he is in precarious shape his survival instincts are better than hers . He thinks about the photograph he tore up in the attic , then he looks down at Lewis ' clothing . &nbsp; WAYNE ( continuing ) You know I really loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIANNEWhy ? &nbsp; WAYNEThis is n't right . &nbsp; DIANNEI loved Lewis too . . . I even love you . . . They look at one another . The controlled intensity of the afternoon breaks like an engorged dam . Spontaneously , they embrace and kiss . It ignites both of them to a sense of harmony , of sexual oneness . Its essence fills the arbor . It is unplanned  --  and inescapable . They start to break apart , then kiss again . For them , time has stopped : they are in the past and Wayne becomes the leader , the lover , the master as he eases her down onto the pine needles , brushing away the debris of others as he goes .

She stands just inside the doorway . Everything is absolutely still . She begins to fill with tears but brushes them away . She tries to make sense out of this building that 's been set aside for the preservation of the insane . The door at the opposite end of the building opens and a MAN of impeccable presence enters . He is reflected in the high gloss of the floor as he makes his way down the corridor . Dianne stands rooted , unable to move as she watches him move from door to door , opening some , disappearing inside for a few seconds , reappearing , continuing down the hall , nodding occasionally to someone who passes him . As he gets closer , one is struck by his magnificent carriage . He holds a parcel of roses fresh from his garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another corridor . Dianne walks to that hallway , turns and watches the man as he continues his walk . 92 ANGLE This wing of the hospital is active with office personnel . He stops once at a drinking fountain and then continues his walk down the hall and disappears into an office . CUT TO : 93 INT . DR . HOFFMAN 'S OFFICE - DAY Dianne knocks at the half-open door to Dr. Hoffman 's office . &nbsp; DIANNEDr . Hoffman ? &nbsp; HOFFMAN ( O.S. ) Yes ? Dianne opens the door and steps inside . He is in fact the man she watched walk through the halls . He stands at his desk arranging the roses . Part of the office is book lined . There is a large window to watch the seasons pass and a paternal comfort prevades the room . He smiles kindly . &nbsp; HOFFMANCome in . . . Some medical files and notepads are stacked on the desk . Dianne enters carefully . &nbsp; DIANNEMy name is Dianne Cruise . I 'd like to talk about Wayne VanTil if you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; HOFFMANYes . Sit down , Miss Cruise . I 'll be right back . He takes the flowers and disappears , leaving Dianne to seat herself and look around the room . He comes back in with the rose filled vase full of water . He places them on his desk and sits down . He studies her for a moment . &nbsp; HOFFMAN ( continuing ) What can I do for you ? There is something in his manner that stretches out time . Dianne is beside herself with worry . &nbsp; DIANNEHow is he ? &nbsp; HOFFMANWayne ? &nbsp; DIANNEYes , Wayne VanTil . . . &nbsp; HOFFMANHe 's had a severe breakdown and I 've put him back on Thorazine . &nbsp; DIANNEThorazine ? &nbsp; HOFFMANThorazine , Miss Cruise . Or do n't you approve ? &nbsp; DIANNEBut what happened ? &nbsp; HOFFMANPerhaps you should tell me , Miss Cruise . &nbsp; DIANNEWhat ? &nbsp; HOFFMANHow you ruined six months of treatment . &nbsp; DIANNEHow I. . .  --  107  --  &nbsp; HOFFMANDid you think you could help him , Miss Cruise ? Did you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wayne 's life ? Did you think you were being objective ? Dianne ca n't speak for the moment . &nbsp; HOFFMAN ( continuing ) Did you know what you were doing , Miss Cruise , playing your little game of transference ? I wonder if it was for him or for yourself . You identify yourself not only with Lewis but as Lewis ' girlfriend . Then you dress Wayne up in a dead boy 's clothing . Is your present life so insufficient that you have to make love to a dead boy 's memory ? &nbsp; DIANNE ( horrified ) I did n't mean any harm . &nbsp; HOFFMANTransference is a very powerful psychiatric weapon and you could n't have used it more dangerously . You twisted Wayne 's perception so badly it 's almost as if you set out to destroy him . &nbsp; DIANNEThat 's not true , he opened . . . he opened up . He showed me things . &nbsp; HOFFMAN ( interrupting ) Mrs. VanTil mentioned that you were in my line of work . . . &nbsp; DIANNEYes . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; HOFFMAN ( with disdain ) In Los Angeles .  --  108  --  &nbsp; DIANNEHow did you know ? &nbsp; HOFFMANI did some checking , Miss Cruise . I 'm sure you would if you were in my position . Clinical Psychologists are a phenomenon of large cities . Here in Ludington you would only be available for the administration of psychological tests . &nbsp; DIANNEAnd how do you take care of Wayne , Dr. Hoffman ? Keep him quiet , keep him still , keep him locked away from the rest of the world . Keep him under control  --  &nbsp; HOFFMANWould you like to continue the treatment of your patient , Miss Cruise ? &nbsp; DIANNEWhere is he ? &nbsp; HOFFMANIn a catatonic state . . . Perhaps you could find some more old clothes , Miss Cruise . &nbsp; DIANNEStop it . &nbsp; HOFFMANDo you know what precipitated Wayne 's condition ? &nbsp; DIANNENo . &nbsp; HOFFMANDid you know that Wayne feels responsible for all of it : the death , his father 's leaving his mother , all of it ? &nbsp; DIANNENo , my God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  109  --  &nbsp; DIANNEAnd most surgeons cure by amputation . &nbsp; HOFFMANWhat is your answer , Miss Cruise , to cure by rediscovery ? Your rediscovery or the patients ' ? Your oblique walk down Memory Lane with you , an imposter as the leader , and Wayne the follower , has done more damage to him than a surgeon ever could . Impersonating a doctor should be a crime . . . I only wish it were a crime , so I could revoke your license , Miss Cruise . Dianne begins to cry . Shame , outrage , frustration , release  --  all of it . She looks at Hoffman and exits quickly . CUT TO : 94 INT . HALLS - DAY We FOLLOW her as she runs through the halls crying . It is as if she fell a thousand leagues to the bottom of the ocean , discovered its lore and is frantically swimming to the surface for air . CUT TO : Section Details 95 EXT .

She puts a bunch of grocery store roses into a glass vase and adds water .

She grabs the small suitcase and moves into the bedroom . CUT TO : 98 INT . BEDROOM - DAWN She drops the bag on the bed , goes to the window and opens it . The room is not the way we first saw it .

BATHROOM - DAWN The room is dimly lit . Dianne turns on the light and examines her face in the mirror . She traces a wrinkle-line and runs her hands through her quite short hair . She feels she 's being watched . She glances at the left of the mirror panel and SEES a young girl looking back . Dianne looks away , then turns back . The girl is still there . It is Dianne , age 13 . &nbsp; DIANNE AGE 13Dianne ? I 've been looking for you . You 're a real disappointment . &nbsp; DIANNEAnd you 're a real pain in the ass . &nbsp; DIANNE AGE 13You 're the one with the pain . Dianne starts to cry . &nbsp; DIANNE ( enraged ) Stop it , damnit ! She slams a brush down on the counter top and breaks it . &nbsp; DIANNE ( continuing , softly ) Oh hell . . . &nbsp; DIANNE AGE 13Do you like me ? &nbsp; DIANNEWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .

I love you . &nbsp; DIANNE AGE 13 ( softly ) Okay , I 'm going to leave now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DIANNE AND DIANNE AGE 13I love you . The young girl DISAPPEARS . Dianne turns away from the mirror . We SEE her face straight on . No makeup , no examining , in the same angle we first saw her . We sense for the first time that Dianne has come to terms with her past . We HOLD on her and  --  CUT TO : Section Details 100 INT . LIVING ROOM - DAWN THROUGH the DOOR FRAME we WATCH as DIANNE walks to the bed , looks under it and hauls out the box of memorabilia . She picks it up and carries it into the living room . She places it on the floor , removes the lid and starts going through papers , pictures , diaries , old corsages , yearbooks and wedding pictures . At one point she walks into the bedroom and comes back with the remaining journals from the trip and a photograph from the desk which we now recognize as David Brinks , her ex-husband . She sorts through things quickly , TEARING most everything that is " to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lewis and Eric . She walks to her purse and takes the wedding pictures out of her wallet , tears them in half and throws them in the box . She saves a few neutral things : a football pom-pom , some ribbons from a corsage and a graduation tassel . She puts them in a smaller box that was inside the larger box and places it on a bookshelf in the living room . She picks up the large " to go " box and walks out the front door . CUT TO :  --  113  --  101 EXT . DIANNE 'S HOUSE - DAY We WATCH Dianne dump the box of " past " into a large commercial trash bin that will be picked up later by a commercial trash truck .

We SEE Dianne 's face and we HEAR a 13 year old VOICE say : &nbsp; VOICEDianne ? Dianne looks shocked but the VOICE CONTINUES and she feels a tug at her arm . &nbsp; VOICE ( continuing ) How come you ran away ? Dianne turns around . She half expects the voice to be from her past . Instead , it belongs to DYLAN who stands quite firmly by her side . &nbsp; DYLAN ( continuing ) You missed the heat and I won the juniors .
