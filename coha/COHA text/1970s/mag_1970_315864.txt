AMERICA 'S long embryonic supersonic transport plane , which has had no fewer than four Presidents willing to claim fatherhood , turned out last week to be only an idea whose time has not yet come . The development may be merely a forced rest ; for the time being , however , the giant 1,800-m.p.h. plane is grounded , thanks to a surprising 52-to-41 Senate vote that denied another $290 million for its development . Behind the vote was the persistence of a single Senator and the force of a newer idea : protection of the environment . <P> The Senator was William Proxmire , Wisconsin Democrat . He has led some lonely fights in the past , but none seemed as desperate as his campaign against the SST . The nation has already spent $800 million on the plane ; last year , when Proxmire made a similar attempt to cut off the flow of money , he was defeated 58 to 22 . But for the past eight months , he has been joined by a sizable citizens ' army of environmentalists , including members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wilderness Society . <P> Intolerable Noise . In an effort combining both professional and amateur lobbying , they besieged Senators from all over the country-excluding almost none , not even diehard SST backers . Their message : the SST was patently a luxury for the jet set , saving inconsequential hours at huge cost , and potentially a lethal one for everyone . It might pollute the upper air , even cause skin cancer by hampering the formation of the ozone layer that filters out ultraviolet sunlight , create intolerable noise at airports and monstrous , destructive sonic booms while it was airborne . Finally , they argued , it would take millions of dollars that could be better spent . The day before the vote last Thursday , the lobbyists were still at work , pressing their case in the offices of several Senators . <P> The salient mark of their effectiveness , and of Proxmire 's own unrelenting exposition of anti-SST arguments in the Senate , is the fact that when the roll call came , 19 Senators who voted against Proxmire last year voted for him this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long an environmental expert , spoke against the added funds and got Proxmire 's thanks . Muskie responded with a grin and a clenched-fist gesture that seemed to say , " Let 's go get ' em . " <P> They got ' em . Voting to cut off funds were 34 Democrats and 18 Republicans , despite last-minute telephone appeals from the White House . Voting with the Administration were 21 Republicans and 20 Democrats . One candid White House aide said : " It was a bad creaming , frankly . "
