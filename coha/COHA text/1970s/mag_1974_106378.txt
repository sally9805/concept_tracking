Bobby Chacon started jumping up and down when the count reached five . His opponent was on the seat of his pants near the ring ropes , not about to rise again , and for the crowd from the streets of East Los Angeles and the dusty flatlands of San Fernando Valley , the scene was just right . It represented the ultimate victory of one of their own . // After Chacon had raised his arms in triumph , he leaned over the ropes to make physical contact with the cheering , stomping , waving crowd . Then he paused . " Where 's my belt ? Where 's my trophy ? " he asked . It was as if he had to see and touch the prizes before he could be sure he had come all this way from the days when his fights had earned him rewards of a different kind : appearances in juvenile courtrooms , charges of possession of drugs , a cop 's nightstick splitting the top of his head . // In winning the vacant World Boxing Council featherweight title from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic Auditorium , Chacon scored his 23rd knockout in 26 fights , a remarkable percentage for the 126-pound class . His manager , Joe Ponce , summed it up best . " God gave Bobby a heavy hand , " he said . // Chacon threw his heavy right hand often in the early rounds , but they had little effect on Marcano , a former junior lightweight champion , who in his turn scored with several punches to the liver in the sixth and seventh that clearly hurt Chacon . Indeed , the Venezuelan appeared to be gaining command . Then he made a key mistake . // Instead of continuing to take the fight to Chacon , Marcano fought timidly in the eighth round , both boxers bouncing cautiously around the ring , exchanging a few punches , watching , waiting . That round of rest was all Chacon needed . He came out fast in the ninth and resumed his attack . Marcano , the 27-year-old veteran of nearly 60 fights , struck back and landed some punches , but it was too late . At 2:18 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked him back on the seat of his pants . And there he remained . // Chacon began dancing around the ring . " I was celebrating , " he said afterward . " I was praying , ' Stay down . Stay down . ' " // Chacon 's rapid ascent to the top has been accompanied by a popularity of extraordinary dimensions , particularly in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community . Despite an unlikely 6 p.m. starting time ( to accommodate Venezuelan television ) , the fight drew 6,416 and took in more than $87,000 at the gate . Last May 16,080 jammed the Olympic to see Chacon beat Danny Lopez ( the house record is 16,200 for the Muhammad Ali-Archie Moore fight in 1962 ) and closed-circuit television had to be set up nearby to handle the overflow . // On Labor Day some 4,500 fans came to the crumbling old downtown arena to applaud a routine Chacon sparring session . When the workout ended they lined up three deep around the ring , thrusting out paper for Chacon to autograph , hands for him to shake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of mass affection that would have brought tears to the eyes of a political advance man . // The irony of this Latin adulation is that Chacon was born in the U.S. , has been south of Tijuana only on a few vacations and speaks virtually no Spanish . Indeed , some of his fights have been against Mexican boxers who crossed the border accompanied by their own fans , to whom Chacon was the gringo . " They come up for their fighters , " Bobby says . " I beat them and then they 're for me. " // Chacon 's victory over Marcano technically gave him only one-half of the featherweight title , the WBC half . The World Boxing Association version of the championship still belongs to Ruben Olivares , who is perhaps the only local fighter as popular as Chacon . These factors , plus Olivares ' 1973 victory over Chacon  --  Bobby 's only professional defeat  --  would make a rematch for the undisputed title perhaps as big a fight as has ever been staged in Los Angeles . Unfortunately , such a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each boxing faction to take a chance on losing its claim to the championship and because of unfriendly rivalry between the area 's two major promoters . Olivares is tied up by Jack Kent Cooke 's Forum , while Chacon , who has fought for Forum Promoter Don Fraser in the past , is committed to two more fights for Aileen Eaton , promoter at the Olympic . // Still , while fans might be impatient to see the rematch , Chacon can afford the wait . He will not be 23 until November . He has been boxing professionally only 2 ? years and has already left behind him a beaten string of top fighters , among them former bantamweight champion Chucho Castillo and top featherweight contender Frankie Crawford . Chacon will be happy to slow the pace down a bit . " Now I can get $40,000 or $50,000 a fight so I wo n't have to fight so often , " he says . " With me , money is the main thing . I want to make my family comfortable . I want to give my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life Bobby Chacon did have was grim . " The fighting was always there , " he says of his teen-age days . " We were always stealing things : tires out of gas stations , food . You just took whatever you wanted . I started stealing cars when I was in the ninth grade . // " I got caught with Seconal and marijuana . I guess I was in the police station six or eight times and I had a lot of other brushes with the cops . Once one of them laid my head open with a nightstick . I 've still got a scar . And I ran away from home a lot . " // For all his street-fighting experience , Chacon never really considered boxing as a way to make money . It was his wife Valerie who suggested he give it a try one night while they were watching a fight on television . // " I 'd never seen him actually fight , " she says . " But people would come to me after a street fight and say , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he ought to try boxing . " Then , as if recognizing that this is a long way from the attitude of the stereotyped boxer 's wife constantly pleading with her man to quit , she laughs , " People must think I 'm a cold-blooded old lady . " // The Chacons now live with their two children on a 2 ? - acre ranch at the north end of the Valley , just down the road from the house Valerie was raised in . Olive trees crowd the grounds and fig trees line the border of the property ; there is a pen full of chickens , turkeys , rabbits and ducks and there is a corral with three horses . // " Olivares bought this place for me , " Chacon says smiling , thinking of the big purse from his one defeat , " and Danny Lopez furnished it " An uncle and a cousin live in a converted garage in back and the place teems with a variety of friends , relatives and in-laws . // In getting ready for the Marcano fight , Chacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that calls for a desert-island atmosphere . He lived at home and commuted to the downtown gym where he worked out . The idea of a fighter being surrounded by his family while training is , of course , horrifying to boxing managers everywhere , and in Bobby 's corner Joe Ponce was no exception . But Chacon insisted , for no larger reason than the fact that his daughter did not talk to him when he returned from a long training camp some time ago . He did not want the same thing to happen with his son . // Along with his personal appearances , Chacon has become a familiar figure on local Sunday morning community-service television programs . And he has held some preliminary discussions about becoming an actor . " Paramount says they 're thinking about casting me for a movie on Willie Pep , " he says . // Chacon 's public reputation also is enhanced by the time he spends prowling the corridors of the schools in his old Valley neighborhood , often in the company of an ex-schoolboy chum , USC 's Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chacons on the virtues of a life free from crime and drugs , subjects on which he has gained expertise firsthand . // What lies ahead for the new champ ? For sure , Bobby and Valerie plan to milk boxing for everything it can give them . " We asked our accountant how much Bobby would need to retire at 25 and live off the interest , " she says . " He told us . That 's what we 're working toward . " // " When I first started , " says Chacon , " I thought about the championship . But that 's not what is important to me now . " He looks at Bobby Jr . practicing a backward crawl on the floor . Then he looks out the picture window through the olive trees at his property . " This is what is important to me , " he says .
