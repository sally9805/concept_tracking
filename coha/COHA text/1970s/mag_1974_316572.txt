THE WORLD OF LENNY BRUCE <P> Assembled by FRANK SPEISER <P> To Lenny Bruce , hypocrisy was the prime obscenity . He wanted to exorcise it publicly . He wanted the hypocrite in each member of the audience to confess and condemn himself . He was a messianic imp of the perverse who wanted to cleanse souls through blasphemy , to free language with four-letter words , to restore nudity and copulation and natural bodily functions to the innocent purposes of nature . <P> He both succeeded and failed . He certainly brought about a change in inner attitudes , so that the comic material for which he was scorned and prosecuted meets with relatively easy acceptance today . Outwardly , little has changed . The substance of the first two-thirds of this one-man show-a toilet-training routine , assorted scatology , corrosively Jewish anti-Semitic byplay-could no more find its way into print in most publications now than when Bruce first delivered it in the ' 50s and ' 60s . Most supper-club managers would still label it as " sick . " <P> The last third of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaten man . It is Author-Actor Frank Speiser 's indubitable triumph , a coruscatingly impressive display of acting skill . His mind chatters , his hands tremble with terminal withdrawal symptoms . He is a burnt-out case spilling his legal papers and tapes while the cool , disembodied voice of the law tells him that his case is closed . Merely to look at him is to be terribly moved : one beholds the dumb , spent eyes of the fox at the end of hunt . <P> T.E.Kalem
