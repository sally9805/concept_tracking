txt A CAT-AND-MOUSE game between over-the-road truck drivers and the Ohio state patrol threatened Wednesday to flare into sneaky warfare . At issue : That infernal 55 m. p. h. speed limit . Truckers insist they 're observing the law and adhering to the Unwritten Code of Honor of the Road at the same time . Under this code , a sort of gentleman 's agreement , highway police of various states allow vehic , les to travel , say , 5 m. p . It . or so over the limit because speedometers tend to vary . IN OHIO , the truckers say , the ungentlemanly state patrolmen are " busting " truckers for a paltry 2 or 3 m. p. h. over the limit . And the fines are bruising : A minimum of $20 . One trucker , on arrival in Chicago , reported that in Ohio he was fined $100 for going 59 m. p. h. ? according to the cop 's speedometer . Consequentaly , the truck drivers are seething and plotting revenge , in their own unique fashion . These drivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for cartage firms , can stage a protest demonstration without ever organizing , or holding an executive board meeting , or painting picket signs . In the cabs of their semi-trailers they carry citizen 's band short-wave radios , and all along the nation 's expressways and turnpikes the radios crackle with an exchange of information , passed along from one truck to another . THIS LOOSE network Is anchored to truck stops along the major intersections , where truckers pause to refuel , to eat , to drink coffee . Tuesday at Mel Berman 's Union 76 No. 5 truck stop at Toledo , driver J. D. Smilin ' Jack ' Cagle , 37 , of Roanoke , Va. , unloaded some prize invective pertaining to Ohio patrolmen and spoke of plans for revenge that he has heard buzzing over his CB radio . " Whatever we do to take off the heat will be legal , " he said . " We 're going to be driving the legal minimum speed-15  --  and let traffic pile up behind us . Then there 's some talk of boycotting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio and not even stop to eat at the places . We hate to do it because they 're our friends , but they do have some power iwith Ohio authorities ' and they might act to have the heat taken off us . " SMILIN ' JACK unsmilingly told of being stopped by a state patrol car on U. S. Hwy. 23 near Circleville . " My speedometer showed 48 and he said I was going 53 . This was a 50 m.p.h. zone . He warned me that one mile over the limit could bring a $30 fine . I think he spotted my twin radio antennas because he stopped a mile ahead and waited for me . He thought I was tipping off other drivers that a patrolman was in the vicinity . " Cagle , who drives for Hennis Freight Lines of WinstonSalem , N.C. , said that states around Ohio give a leeway of 5 m.p.h. ; West Virginia allows 9 miles over and Virginia 7 . A SPOKESMAN for the Illinois State Police at Crestwood said the leeway given to trucks and private vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the discretion of the individual trooper . " While Smiling Jack was still sipping his coffee and thinking unkind thoughts about uncharitable policemen . the headquarters of the Ohio State Patrol in Columbus expressed ignorance of any crackdown on rigs . " We 'll stop anyone who breaks the law , " said a spokesman .
