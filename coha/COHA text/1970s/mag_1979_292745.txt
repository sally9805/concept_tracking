How Castro paid $8.7 million and got not a single cupful <P> As Cuba 's ruler for the past 20 years , Fidel Castro obviously was n't born yesterday . He has triumphed over at tempted invasions , coups and assassinations . He has felt confident enough to send troops to Africa to stir up trouble . Yet he has now been taken , in a huge swindle brought off by a group of men accused of selling Cuba a cargo of nonexistent coffee . The ruse , involving transactions from Canada to the Caribbean , ultimately collapsed , but not before Cuba was relieved of about $8.7 million-perhaps the worst sting the Cuban dictator has ever suffered . <P> The Cuban government , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , the FBI , and the U.S. Justice Department 's Strike Force are all involved in the attempt to untangle the swindle . Authorities have arrested one man , a West German commodities broker named Karl Fessler , charged three more , and are seeking others . <P> In an attempt to support Castro 's faltering economy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows at a price higher than on the world market . In fact , Cuba has even been accused in some anti-Castro quarters of mixing imported coffee with home grown and then selling the spurious blend to the Russians . Be that as it may , Cuba does import cheaper coffee for domestic consumption . <P> Knowing the Cubans ' need for coffee , Karl Fessler , a jet-hopping high roller , is said to have made them an attractive offer in late 1977 . According to the Cuban government , Fessler told its trade representatives that he would sell them 3,000 metric tons of " Barahona , " a choice Arabic blend grown in the Dominican Republic , at a bargain price . Reportedly , Fessler and some cohorts produced all the documents attesting to the availability of the coffee , and the deal was clinched last October on the Caribbean island of St. Martin . The Cubans agreed to a price of $1.39 a lb. , vs. $1.54 on the world market . In a later meeting , the Cubans asked if they could inspect the coffee . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . <P> Except that not a single coffee bean existed . Companies were set up in the Caribbean and an aging freighter of Panamanian registry was bought for $700,000 . The culprits proceeded to pay off anybody who might hinder the swindle . The Justice Department estimates that hundreds of thousands of dollars were paid out . <P> The ship without the coffee was launched near Santo Domingo last November . The plan was to sink it en route to Havana . The gang expected to collect twice : once from the duped Cubans , a second time from the company that insured the ship . When the freighter was at sea , Fessler and a confederate are said to have marched into the Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto . All sorts of papers were shown verifying that the coffee was on its way : a telex from the ship 's captain , complete invoices , bills of lading , inspection receipts . Following the instructions of Cuba 's brokers , the bank promptly disbursed the $8.7 million as Fessler directed .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
