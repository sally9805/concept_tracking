The pattern was all too familiar . Three men , armed with pistols and a grenade , strode into the French embassy in The Hague just before closing time and occupied the fourth floor of the modern concrete and glass building . Seizing eleven hostages , including French Ambassador Count Jacques Senard and several business executives , they issued a nonnegotiable demand : a comrade held in a French prison must be released or the hostages would be killed one by one , beginning at 3 next morning . The demand was scrawled in red ink on a piece of paper and tossed out a window . It was from the Japanese Red Army , the terrorist group that two years ago gained international notoriety by massacring 27 people at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv . <P> Dutch police immediately rushed into the embassy but were repulsed with two wounded ; two of the Japanese were also hit in the exchange of fire . The police then laid siege to the occupied building while French and Dutch authorities hastily acted to meet the terrorists ' demands . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris last July after he was found carrying counterfeit bills , fake passports , and a plan for attacks on embassies and businesses throughout France-be freed . He was whisked from his Parisian jail to The Netherlands in a French air force jet . ( Strangely , Furuya resisted the move so strenuously that when the plane landed at The Hague airport , he had to be dragged off it . ) <P> The next morning the situation became deadlocked as Dutch negotiators , led by Premier Joop den Uyl , tried desperately to whittle away the resistance of the terrorists . At one point , the talks broke down entirely when the commandos refused to communicate with government spokesmen . The Dutch reopened communications by writing a plea in huge Japanese characters on a 20-ft. roll of paper that was spread out on the street below the embassy windows . The following night , a Boeing 707 and a crew , demanded by the Red Army commandos , was readied for takeoff at nearby Schiphol Airport . Several hours later , two women were released , but the only confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senard waved briefly from a fourth-floor window . One hostage later reported that several of the prisoners quietly discussed trying to overcome the three Japanese while they dozed , but the terrorists quickly awoke whenever anybody got near them . <P> White Gloves . Last Tuesday , after four days of talks , the terrorists accepted a Dutch offer of $300,000 in exchange for the hostages ( France earlier had refused to meet a $1 million ransom demand ) . Wearing black hoods and white gloves and holding guns at the backs of six hostages ( three had been left behind because they were sick ) , the commandos boarded a bus to go to Schiphol Airport . After the hostages boarded the Boeing , Furuya was handed over to the terrorists . Then , as a flight crew boarded the aircraft , the hostages one by one disembarked . Surrounded by hundreds of troops and armored vehicles , the plane lifted off the runway , carrying enough fuel for an 8-hour flight . <P> The plane landed first in Aden , then went north to Jordan and finally to Syria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorists into returning the $300,000 ransom . " They came to the conclusion that the money was no good to them anyway , " he said , apparently because the notes were marked .
