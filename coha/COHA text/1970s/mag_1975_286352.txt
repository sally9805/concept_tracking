" I will conquer and subjugate the world , " says Sun Myung Moon . " I am your brain . " The latter statement is quite literally true for a growing coterie of young American converts , who regard the South Korean cult leader ( TIME , Sept. 30 , 1974 ) as the second Christ . Asking no questions , they obediently hawk candy and flowers , raising millions to spread the faith . They exist on a shoestring , while Moon , 55 , lives in lordly fashion in a 25-room mansion in New York 's Westchester County . <P> His Unification Church 's national budget alone is $11 million , not counting the expenses of 120 local branches and affiliates . The cult grows steadily and currently claims 30,000 members , 7,000 of whom live in Moon communities . All believe that a " Lord of the Second Advent " ( Moon , though this is not stated publicly ) will redeem mankind physically by fathering a perfect family . A blend of Christian terminology , occultism and dualism is taught in Moon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Moon 's converts are unquestioning , others are not . In recent months , many Moon disputes have flared up . The Unification Church is in court to regain a tax exemption for an estate in the town of Greenburgh , N.Y. , where it has purchased $9 million worth of properties since 1972 . In New York City the church , which regards itself as a Christian sect , is suing for the right to join the local council of churches after becoming the first applicant ever rejected by the council . With criticism of <P> Moon growing , Buckminster Fuller , Norman Cousins and others have withdrawn as advisers for a meeting of eminent world scholars Nov. 27-30 in Manhattan , organized by a Moon front . <P> The growing opposition to the Moon cult focuses primarily on worries about what it is doing to the minds of its young converts . In Dutchess County , N.Y. , District Attorney Albert Rosenblatt is investigating complaints from parents that their children have been " brainwashed " in high-pressure courses at the church 's Barrytown training center . Rosenblatt also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local hospital . <P> Around the country , hundreds of parents have been driven to near hysteria by changes in their convert children 's behavior and by reports of brainwashing . They are filing suits and banding into anti-Moon groups . Some parents have even resorted to abduction . In many cases they use " Deprogrammer " Ted Patrick , who for a fee conducts counter brain washing of cultists . <P> One typical worried parent is New Jersey 's state insurance commissioner James Sheeran , three of whose daughters-Vicki , 25 , Jaime , 24 , and Josette , 21-are Moon converts . He wants laws to protect people from " cruel and exotic entrapment of their minds , souls and bodies . " Late one night last August , Sheeran decided to act when Josette , normally compassionate , showed little interest upon learning that her grandmother was in the hospital . He , his wife and a son drove to Moon 's school to seek Josette . Fifteen Moon men materialized , a scuffle ensued , and state police arrived amid mutual charges of assault .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
