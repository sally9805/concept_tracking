Inspired by the heady success of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in pumping up the price of oil , four countries that account for 70% of the world 's copper exports last week adopted some of OPEC 's tactics . Zambia , Zaire , Chile and Peru , members of a cartel called the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries ( CIPEC ) announced plans to reduce shipments of the metal by 10% . Said Fernandez Maldonado , Peru 's Minister of Energy and Mines : " The Arabs have shown us the way . " <P> The move was prompted by sagging copper prices , down from $3,200 a ton earlier this year to less than $1,400 . Demand has decreased with the worldwide recession and cutbacks in manufacturing . If CIPEC succeeds in raising prices , many industries will be affected . Copper is an important ingredient in cars , planes and trains as well as in plumbing materials , pots and pans , and even intrauterine devices . The U.S. and the Soviet Union , the two largest copper producers , both mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , rely heavily on CIPEC copper . <P> Metal traders were skeptical that CIPEC could drive up prices . They questioned the effectiveness of a cutback in shipments without a reduction in production . Almost in response , the Chilean government announced that it would close down the Exotica Mine for six months ; the mine , one of Chile 's largest , last year produced about 32,000 tons , or only 4% of Chile 's copper exports . That should certainly not be enough to kick up prices-unless more member countries also close their mines . <P> Producers of other materials , too , are now banding together to try to lift prices . Countries that possess iron ore ( including Venezuela and Brazil ) and seven bauxite producers ( Guinea , Guyana , Jamaica , Sierra Leone , Surinam , Australia and Yugoslavia ) are talking about forming cartels . Coffee-producing nations hope to control prices by reducing exports from the Central American republics . Oil-rich Venezuela promises to make up their short-term losses in revenues with subsidies from a special investment fund . <P> For now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflate world prices . The likely members have few close religious , ethnic , cultural or geographical ties , compared with the Middle East nations that make up the core of OPEC . And even OPEC had to wait and struggle for a dozen years after its founding in 1960 before conditions were right for raising prices . Still , the development of the other cartels gives the rest of the world another potentially inflationary force to worry about .
