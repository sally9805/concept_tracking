On rare occasions , the past can be not only recalled but recaptured . Exactly 100 years ago next week , the elder daughter of Horace Greeley , 19th century journalistic war horse and founder-publisher of the New York Tribune , filled a ten-inch-square brass box with quaint mementos of her era and saw the box sealed within the cornerstone of the Tribune 's new headquarters in Lower Manhattan . When that building was demolished in 1968 , the time capsule was found and kept by the wrecker until late last year , when he brought it to a dealer to sell . The solid brass exterior had worn extremely well over a full century . Inside , its contents were a modest guide to some aspects of a vanished era : a department of public works report on the city sewer and water-supply systems , a rule book for the New York senate and assembly , speeches by Greeley , as well as photographs of him and his two daughters , copies of three rival newspapers of the day , even a Congressional Directory for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule was a small plain envelope that bore , in a neat , modest hand , a simple message : " To the descendants of Stephen Tully and Charlotte Augusta Clarke . To be advertised in a New York paper when this box is opened . " Stephen Clarke was the Tribune 's financial editor from 1863 to 1869 , the year he died , and inside the envelope are photographs of him , his wife Charlotte , son Henry , and daughters Charlotte and Mary Jane . The requested notice for the Clarke heirs to step forward and claim the family portraits was duly placed in the New York Times by a Manhattan autograph dealer last week . The remaining contents of the capsule are to be sold at public auction .
