SPINNING RECORD JACKET ZOOMS FORWARD and STOPS , showing us twenty-four cartoon faces packed on its confines , one of those hyper , RECORD-SALESMAN VOICES begins his diatribe . &nbsp; MAN ( V.O. ) Now  --  after years in the making ... The NAMES OF SONGS run down on the RIGHT SIDE OF the SCREEN as the CAST NAMES ROLL UP the OTHER . &nbsp; MAN ( V.O. ) Robert Altman brings you the long-awaited Nashville  --  with twenty-four , count ' em  --  twenty-four of your very favorite stars . The MUSIC COMES IN , loud , SEGUEING FROM ONE SONG to the NEXT , and he continues with a hype on each until everything has whirled and spun and played through your senses . &nbsp; MAN ( V.O. ) And along with the magnificent stars  --  the magic of stereo sound and living-color picture  --  right before your very eyes , without commercial interruption . Now the album with all the photos disappears BACKWARD into a block-printed " NASHVILLE " which becomes the ONLY THING ON the SCREEN for a moment as we hear : &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . On the first Tuesday in November we have to make some vital decisions about our management . EXT . STREET - DAY PULL BACK FROM " NASHVILLE , " we see the sign-covered garage door of the Tennessee State Headquarters of Hal Phillip Walker . The door rises and the Walker truck , the source of the speech , drives out onto the Nashville street .  --  3  --  &nbsp; P.A. VOICE ( V.O. ) Let me go directly to the point . I 'm for doing some replacing . I 've discussed the Replacement Party with people all over this country , and I 'm often confronted with the statement , I do n't want to get mixed up in politics. Or I 'm tired of politics , or I 'm not interested. Let me point out two things . The truck now stops for a signal at the intersection of old music row as MUSIC starts to FILTER INTO the b.g . &nbsp; P.A. VOICE ( V.O. ) Number one  --  all of us are deeply involved with politics whether we know it or not or like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something about it . When you pay more for an automobile than it cost Columbus to make his first voyage to America , that 's politics . The signal changes and the truck continues down the road as we FOLLOW the MUSIC TRACK TO the inside of a recording studio . CUT TO : INT . RECORDING STUDIO - DAY We PAN PAST the glass booth containing spectators , engineers , Haven Hamilton 's son BUD , who looks like a cross between Haven and Glen Campbell . Haven 's mistress , LADY PEARL , dressed in lilac , as usual , of some fifteen-odd years , and his producer , BOB . PANNING ON AROUND we hear Haven singing " Two-Hundred Years " and see some of Nashville 's well-known backup musicians and singers . Finally we see HAVEN HAMILTON himself dressed in white , as usual , peering out from beneath his ill-matched toupee . He is one of the kings of country music , drinks milk , and tries to maintain a gentle attitude toward everyone , although his temper often wins out . He has suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides of an issue at once . He takes his work very seriously . His wife started traveling abroad after their other son was killed in a senseless shooting accident , so they are a marriage in name only .  --  4  --  Bud has practically been raised by Pearl and was too young to even remember his brother . Haven sings on about why we 've lasted two-hundred years . We LOOK BACK IN the glass booth and see a young woman , OPAL , loaded down with camera and recording equipment , not to mention her own patchwork ensemble topped off by a small hat with a musical rhinestone pin , WANDER UP TO the glass and LOOK AT Haven , as though he were an exotic fish . Pearl , knowing Haven 's idiosyncrasies , tries to get the girl 's attention , but too late . Haven has seen her and as she sits down , he stops the session and the dialogue and confusion begin , everything running in OVERLAP . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONHold it , hold it , everybody . &nbsp; BOBHold it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONBob , I want to talk to Buddy . Buddy ! &nbsp; BUDDYYe-yes , sir , Dad . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONBuddy  --  who is that woman in there with the hat on ? Is she a friend of yours ? &nbsp; BUDDYI do n't know , Dad . She 's ... And Opal interrupts but it does n't matter because Haven just talks on . &nbsp; OPALHello , Mr. Hamilton ... &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONBob ... &nbsp; OPALI 'm Opal , I 'm from the BBC and I 'm doing a documentary on Nashville .  --  5  --  &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONBob , Buddy , both of you  --  you know I do n't allow no people visitin ' when I 'm recording . &nbsp; OPALDid you hear me ? &nbsp; LADY PEARLYes , he heard you , dear . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONI want no recording equipment in that studio . Buddy , go on escort the lady out . &nbsp; BUDDYYes , sir . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONIf she wants a copy of this record , she can buy it when it 's released . Would you please ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no strangers allowed at all . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONShe 's breaking my concentration . Opal stands . &nbsp; OPALMr . Hamilton , I 'll be waiting outside for you . &nbsp; LADY PEARLThat 's good . &nbsp; OPALWe 'll have a little interview . Finally , she leaves , smiling ( Opal almost always smiles ) , with Bud who takes her into another studio in the building as Haven says  --  &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONAll right , Bob ; I want to do another one . Jimmy , you count off . I want to hear a little more Haven in this one . CUT TO :  --  6  --  INT . STUDIO B - DAY In the b.g. we hear HAND-CLAPPING and GOSPEL SINGING as Bud opens the door for Opal to Studio B. It 's smaller than A , so they stagger past the engineers and take a seat on the couch . Opal commenting as she goes . &nbsp; BUDDYThis is Studio B right here . And , uh , I think they 're doing some gospel ... &nbsp; OPALOh , how sweeeet ! &nbsp; BUDDY ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ya ? &nbsp; GLENN ( MAN ) Hey , Buddy . &nbsp; OPALIt 's lovely . &nbsp; BUDDYYou do n't mind if we sit in , just a little bit , do you ? &nbsp; GLENNCome on in . &nbsp; BUDDYOkay . Careful ... &nbsp; OPALIt 's so little . You know , I 've been to all the important studios in London . They 're all so enormous and very sort of impersonal . &nbsp; BUDDYWe 'll have to sort of keep it down a little bit so they can see , uh ... hear what 's going on . &nbsp; OPALIt 's like a ... &nbsp; BUDDYThis is a black choir from , uh , part of it from Fisk University here in town .  --  7  --  We see the all-black choir dressed in turquoise robes with gold satin trim , who sing " Do You Believe in Jesus " and answer their one question with " Yes , I do " over and over again . There is one female singer and she is white , LINNEA REESE , somewhere in her mid-thirties . &nbsp; OPALGood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing is a ... &nbsp; OPALA missionary . &nbsp; BUDDYNo , she 's not , she 's a gospel singer . She 's the wife or our attorney . Opal gives us a little of her ambiguous history . &nbsp; OPALI was making a documentary in Kenya , and there was this marvelous woman who was a missionary , that 's why I thought she was a missionary . She was sensational . She was converting Kukuyos by the dozens and she was trying to convert the Masais , of course they were hopeless , I mean ... ( laughs a slight laugh ) ... they have their own sort of religion , do n't they . She listens for " Jesus Knows What 's in Your Soul " and continues : &nbsp; OPALThat really is fantastic . You know , it 's funny you can tell that . It 's come down in the genes through ages and ages and hundreds of years , but it 's there . And take off those robes and , and ... and you 're in darkest Africa . I can just see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on like that in church ?  --  8  --  &nbsp; BUDDYDepends on which church you go to . And they look back at Linnea who bobs up and down , lost somewhere in the rhythm of the song . INT . STUDIO A - DAY We watch Haven and the backup as they sing " I 've lived through two depressions/and seven dustbowl droughts , " when Haven pulls off his headset and shouts : &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONHold it , hold it . The rest of them taper off as he shouts again . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONHold it , everybody . Dammit , Bob . What 's the name of the piano player , Bob ? We hear Bob on the intercom . &nbsp; BOBThat 's Frog . We see a young , hair-heavy pianist , FROG , in current torn-Levi fashion , sitting and looking at the piano as if it made the mistake . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONThat 's Frog . He plays like a frog . Haven puts the headset back on and , assuming a smile , says : &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONWe 'll try it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - DAY The group of gospel singers are rocking out in rhythm and at one point Linnea breaks up and completely disappears . The group continues as the LAST TWO CREDITS COME DOWN .  --  9  --  INT . STUDIO A - DAY Back in Studio A , Haven reaches for the final crescendo and Frog misses again . Haven takes off the headset and slams it down on the podium . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONDammit to hell . We hear Bob on the intercom . &nbsp; BOBHold it , everybody . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONBob  --  &nbsp; BOBYes , sir . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONWhat did you say the piano player 's name was ? &nbsp; BOBFrog . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONYeah . When I ask for Pig , I want Pig . Now you get me Pig and then we 'll be ready to record this here tune . &nbsp; BOBYes , sir . Haven steps out of the booth , displaying his **28;580;TOOLONG outfit , and walks past Frog on his way out the door . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONYou get your hair cut ; you do n't belong in Nashville . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - DAY With " One I Love You " blaring in Franklin High School band time , we see the " Welcome to Nashville " sign on the airport tower .  --  10  --  On the ground we see a three-ring circus of people inside the airport , airport security , people trying to get through the doors and out onto the steaming pavement , TV cameras , reporters , Chamber of Commerce , the high school band , and at least fifty twirling majorettes from the Tennessee Twirling Institute . Hal Phillip Walker 's signs can be seen THROUGH the glass , and all the Airport Traffic proceeds , occasionally DROWNING OUT the sound of the TV COMMENTATOR an all the preparations for Barbara-Jean 's arrival . &nbsp; ANNOUNCERThis is Bill Jenkins on special assignment for Channel Two News here at Metro Airport . We are awaiting the arrival of Barbara-Jean , who , as you know , has been away for special treatment at the Baltimore Burn Center . Already , prior to her arrival , Barbara-Jean fans and other supporters are here at the airport . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police . Other members of the Chamber of Commerce are on the way . Also , at this report , Haven Hamilton will make an appearance here at Metro Airport . CUT TO : INT . TERMINAL - DAY A lean paratrooper , PVT .

And he continues into the crowd packed against the glass , some of them to see their idol , others just because there is a crowd and they 're curious . CUT TO : EXT . AIRPORT - FRONT - DAY We see the Walker truck move behind a fellow on a black and white , three-wheeled motorcycle . WALKER 'S MESSAGE DRONES ON as the praying mantis-looking vehicle stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a would-be singer-songwriter in a chauffeur 's uniform . The TRICYCLE MAN climbs off the motorcycle . He is long and thin , looking a little like a praying mantis himself . As he walks into the terminal , he takes off a green scarf and magically turns it red , and to Norman 's astonishment ties it back around his neck and goes into the building . During all of this , Walker 's truck , with its INCESSANT SPEAKER SYSTEM , spews out a MESSAGE about the government forcing its citizens to swallow a camel . CUT TO : EXT . AIRFIELD - DAY Barbara-Jean 's blue and white Cessna touches down and starts to taxi toward the anxiously waiting crowd , as the Announcer continues his blow-by-blow account of her arrival . &nbsp; ANNOUNCER ( V.O. ) Her plane has touched down ... it 's down the taxi-way now ... and will be arriving at any moment now onto the ramp area directly here , practically in front of us here at Metro Airport . CUT TO : INT . AIRPORT RESTAURANT - DAY The Tricycle Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt for his salad , via the air , in a magic trick that WADE COOLIDGE watches closely .  --  12  --  Dishwashing is one of Wade 's three jobs a day . He 's black , spent twenty-seven years in jail , studied law in jail and got himself out with the aid of thirteen lawyers , about four months ago . An older man sits down at the counter , MR . GREEN . He and his wife live in Nashville , had an antique and fix-it shop before he retired . Now they rent rooms in their house to would-be musicians and Bible salesmen . A little deaf and very tired , he 's come to pick up his niece , Martha , whom he last saw when she was about twelve or thirteen . &nbsp; GREENAhh ... Miss ... May ! &nbsp; SUELEENHi . SUELEEN GAY has red hair and is lost somewhere in 1940 and her fantasy about being a singer . One is struck by her wide-eyed innocence and overt sexual display . She reminds you of those girls who came to Hollywood to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; GREENHi ... a ... I 'll have a caramel sundae . &nbsp; SUELEENWe ai n't go no caramel sundae . &nbsp; GREENButterscotch ? This continues until they arrive at strawberry . Sueleen goes off and shouts her order to the air and Wade pulls her over , points to the Tricycle Man , and they stand watching him do his trick . Wade ca n't believe it . &nbsp; WADESueleen , did you see what he just did ? Took the thing off the salt and threw it in the air . Did you see that ? Sueleen walks over to the Tricycle Man who smiles behind his yellow glasses and truly looks like a magical bug . &nbsp; SUELEENHow 'd you do that ?  --  13  --  At the other end of the counter , a local MAN next to Mr. Green crunches his crackers with his fist and talks . Mr. Green , not really wanting to engage but also not wanting to be impolite , tells him that his wife is sick as Sueleen brings his sundae . &nbsp; MANI 'm sorry to hear that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MANHappens in the best of families . &nbsp; GREEN ( slight laugh ) Yea . Sueleen has wandered back to the Tricycle Man , who does n't speak but just watches her happily . &nbsp; SUELEENI wrote me this real hot song . You want to hear it ? He nods . &nbsp; SUELEENIt 's called I Never Get Enough. He nods again . &nbsp; SUELEENAll right . She looks around and then begins to sing , not very on-key , and half-does gestures to her song about a girl who " always wants more and more . " On the other side of Mr. Green , DELBERT REESE , Linnea 's husband , sits having a cup of coffee . He ca n't believe his ears , Sueleen is tone deaf , but he ca n't take his eyes off the translucent-skinned redhead . He 's a lawyer for Haven Hamilton , Barbara-Jean and others . He and Linnea have been married about 14 years , just before he started law school . He 's younger than he looks and wears clothes that make him look wider than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people 's problems and never asks much from anyone but to be liked . His home is his castle but he does n't understand it somehow . He and Linnea have two children who are deaf . All of his activities have kept him too busy to learn sign language , so Linnea acts as an interpreter .  --  14  --  The voice of the loudspeaker announces the arrival of the plane he is waiting to meet . He rises , puts on his dark glasses , and over tips Sueleen who continues to sing " I Never Get Enough . " CUT TO : INT . TERMINAL - DAY A group of girls runs past Reese in red , white and blue outfits with Hal Phillip literature in their hands . The thinnest , leggiest girl you 've ever seen stands like a stork on a pair of platform shoes made to look like feet . She has hennaed hair . Her short-shorts and tiny strapless bra meet like an eraser at the top of a pencil . She checks out the greeters , but her uncle has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big surprise . An older man walks past Reese and he walks forward . &nbsp; DELJohn Triplette ? The older man does n't respond , waves to a friend but a younger man behind him responds . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEYou looking for me ? Del turns and is surprised by JOHN TRIPLETTE being so young . They 've never met before . John is here to put talent together for a televised fund-raising concert for Hal Phillip Walker , the independent presidential candidate whose headquarters we saw at the beginning of the film . Triplette graduated from UCLA somewhere in the mid-fifties . He makes one remember white dinner jackets , Balboa , California , Phi Delta Theta summer dances with paper lanterns , and John F. Kennedy 's dynamic smile . He is a lawyer , and his wife has just divorced him because he was never at home , he has no children . Del sticks out his hand and is bumped by an extremely-beautiful , young woman , MARY , who continues to walk toward the terminal . He looks after her for a moment and then back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRIPLETTEHello . What 's your name ? Del comes forward and takes off his glasses .  --  15  --  &nbsp; DELDel Reese , I 'm sorry . Forgive me these damn glasses . Thanks for coming out . They both smile and chuckle . Triplette says how much he likes the girls in costumes , which Del repeats as they walk into the terminal . CUT TO : EXT . AIRFIELD - DAY Outside , the majorettes trick and twirl as the bands play and more people come toward Barbara-Jean 's plane . Haven and Bud and Lady Pearl round the corner in their white Jeep . An ambulance approaches , too , and the announcer announces as Haven steps down into a cluster of gracious businessmen dressed in Dacron summer suits . CUT TO : INT . TERMINAL - DAY Mr. Green has found his niece , the leggy girl , slightly taller than he is and hardly what he expected . She leans over and tells him that she 's changed her name from Martha to L.A. JOAN . Mr. Green nods , not having heard at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he heard , so he continues . &nbsp; GREENAunt Esther wants to see you . She 's in the hospital . She does n't feel too well . At this point a long , lanky fellow with a beard , guitar and a very friendly attitude toward the four stewardesses who are walking with him , wanders over to a cigarette machine in back of Mr. Green . L.A. Joan has spotted him . &nbsp; L.A. JOANWait a minute . I think this guy 's a rock star . &nbsp; GREEN ( not hearing ) And she 'd like to see you .  --  16  --  &nbsp; L.A. JOANWait , hang on ... She leaves Green in the center of the floor as she pulls out an album and plops it down on top of the machine . &nbsp; L.A. JOANHi . Can I get your autograph ? You 're Tom , are n't you . Tom , Bill , and Mary ? TOM FRANK is handsome in a wayward way , and his music-fan following is large and taken care of personally whenever he can tend to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; TOMJesus , you ought a stop that diet before you ruin yourself . Section Details INT . COUNTRY MUSIC STAND - DAY We see the beautiful Mary and her guitar-toting husband , BILL . They are the other two-thirds of Tom , Bill , and Mary , and are in Nashville to cut an album . Their last one was a couple of years ago and had a standout single , " It Do n't Worry Me . " Until Tom got his plane ticket , they had n't seen each other in a few months and thus far with great forethought has managed to lose them . Bill is extremely ambitious and seems to carry the responsibility of the other two like a stage mother . He pulls up to a picture of their album in front of the record stand and sees a large picture of Connie White with a Hal Phillip Walker sticker attached to her bosom . &nbsp; BILLHey  --  they have our album here . ( to the girl ) How 's it selling ? Mary pulls him along . &nbsp; BILLI 'm the handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my glasses on but ... Wait a minute .

Haven signs autographs as Pearl continues to talk whether anyone listens or not . &nbsp; LADY PEARLLittle kids , honey  --  they practiced every day for a whole month ... &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONYes , they 're so nice . &nbsp; LADY PEARLIs n't that cute ? Haven finishes his last autograph . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONI think that 'll cheer her up and , Pearl , shut up . Pvt . Kelley , the paratrooper , stands at the window listening to the announcer tell how Barbara-Jean was tragically burned in an accident in a fire as a child , which brought she and Haven together . He wrote his first hit tune for her . Del and Triplette approach BARNETT , the announcer drones on about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits to the burn center . Del walks to Barnett , a rotund energetic man , who is Barbara-Jean 's husband and manager . Barnett has made her his life . He was an orderly in the hospital where she recovered as a child and stayed until she was 15 when they were married . She wrote songs , met Haven , who introduced her to a public who 's adored her ever since . Barnett runs interference for her schedule that is usually too crowded , often making himself appear foolish in his intensity . He has a thick Fu Manchu mustache , a brown , leather jacket , and a soiled necktie . Contrary to the basic convention of Tom , Bill and Mary 's hit song , everything worries Barnett . &nbsp; DELHello , Barnett ! Barnett throws up his arms in dismay  --  &nbsp; BARNETTI got no time right now , Jesus  --   --  18  --  As Del scratches his head and Triplette , who 's never quite seen anything like it , laughs and breaks the tension .

AIRFIELD &nbsp; BUDDYHi ... &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONThank you , Buddy . &nbsp; LADY PEARLOh , that 's lovely . The twirlers complete their routine and the band breaks into Barbara-Jean 's theme song as the announcer , Haven , and media people move forward to drink her in . BARBARA-JEAN steps from the plane and starts walking to her waiting fans . Air traffic continues behind her . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at the same time . She is small-boned , fragile-looking and beautiful in the sense of 1940 's , beautiful movie stars . She would rather cook for 40 than most anything else except singing . She writes her own songs that are full of her philosophy .  --  19  --  She is available to anyone who can get near her with a problem , and one can see that Barnett has his hands full . CUT TO : INT . TERMINAL - DAY Bill and Mary watch her as Norman , late , comes up in back of them and taps their shoulders , saying " Hi , Bill " to Mary and " Hi , Mary " to Bill . They moan their responses to the bad joke and start outside as Wade tries to pry Sueleen from the window . &nbsp; WADEAre you gon na ride into town with me or not ? &nbsp; SUELEENYou better go without me . I 'm gon na wait ' cause I think she 's gon na sing . &nbsp; WADEWho , her ? She ai n't gon na sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on . CUT TO : EXT .

Thank you so much . Ah ... Now she looks and addresses those adoring fans . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANI 'd like to thank you for coming out to meet me today . It 's great to be home . It 's hot as a firecracker ... Everyone laughs .  --  20  --  &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANMe and the boys are goin ' to be at the Opry this week . And like my granddaddy always used to say , If you 're down by the river , I hope you 'll drop in. She waves and signals off as Lady Pearl says " Is n't that lovely .

Barnett sighs , looks at the crowd , and helps her away from the podium . Followed by Haven and the rest of the news media , everyone talks at once , as usual . The commentator is commenting on her every step and just after Barnett tells her to look out for the water , she turns and collapses . Everyone screams , closes around her and people break the security guard inside the building , pouring out in curious droves . Pvt . Kelly stands forlornly as three band members and the hospital attendant lift her to the stretcher . CUT TO : EXT . AIRPORT - DAY L.A. Joan and Mr. Green walk to his Nash , Triplette and Delbert to Del 's Cadillac , Wade and Sueleen to Wade 's on-the-repair pickup , and Tom to a sun-roofed Volkswagen filled with stewardesses . Walker 's P.A. voice continues .  --  21  --  &nbsp; P.A. ( V.O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Engineers ? Teachers ? Businessmen ? No , my friends , Congress is run by lawyers .

He told you how to make a watch , did n't he ? Ever ask a lawyer how to get to Mr. Jones ' house in the country ? You got lost , did n't you ? Congress is composed of five hundred and thirty-five individuals  --  two hundred and eighty-eight are lawyers . Now all the cars and Wade 's truck proceed to back out of their spaces , accompanied by some FAST-PICKING MUSIC and the inescapable voice of the P.A. At the terminal parking gate , the CAMERA PANS DOWN TO the Tricycle Man , followed by Wade , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeuring Mary and Bill , and a bus with a picture of Connie White on the outside and Pvt .

Haven , in his Jeep with Pearl and Bud , slow to the pile-up , and ahead of them are Pvt . Kelly in the bus , Wade 's truck , Delbert and Triplette , Mary and Bill and Norman , Mr. Green and L.A. Joan , and Tom and the stewardesses . The Walker P.A. is still in operation . &nbsp; P.A.Let 's change our national anthem back to something people could understand .

I saw a leg sticking out ... I wish my cameraman had been here . I need something like this for my documentary . It 's America , all those cars smashing into each other and all those mangled bodies . Barbara-Jean 's ambulance , with SIRENS BLARING , pulls up on the grass in order to bypass the jam and takes off toward town . An old , green Chevrolet pulls out behind and attempts the same maneuver but it stalls . Delbert gets out of his car and walks over to it .

Connie looks at Julie , unable to find a frame of reference for the way she looks . &nbsp; OPALOh , a Hal Phillip Walker button  --  no , it 's Kennedy . Is n't it rather ancient ? I thought everyone in the South did n't go for Kennedy . &nbsp; LADY PEARLJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy ; he took the whole South except for Tennessee , Kentucky , and there 's a reason he did n't take Tennessee . But he got 481 , 450 votes and the asshole got 556 , 577 votes .

Barnett comes through the door carrying a single orchid corsage wrapped in cellophane , and makes his way to Haven 's table where someone says , " Look who 's here . " There is no chair and no one offers to get him one , so he stands uncomfortably behind Connie as Vassar finishes playing and the applause begins . &nbsp; CONNIE ( dimly ) Hi , Barnett . &nbsp; BARNETT ( politely ) How are you , Connie ?  --  79  --  He extends the flower , which she ignores . &nbsp; BARNETTIt 's just a little something that Barbara-Jean told me to pick up for you . &nbsp; CONNIEOh , Barnett , you should n't have done that . &nbsp; BARNETTI know I should n't have , but she told me ; I told her I should n't have .

There is applause and cheers . Haven starts to rise . &nbsp; VASSARMiss Connie White ! Haven changes gears quickly and turns to Connie , who reacts to the unexpected announcement with surprise and then poise . As she leaves , Barnett and his corsage sit down in her chair . Connie makes her way to the stage and begins to sing " Rolling Stone .

I worked in California , out in Stockton where Bobby came . He came here and spoke and went down to Memphis , and when he went out to Stockton , California , he spoke off the Santa Fe train at the old Santa Fe depot . Opal looks around for a way out , but she ca n't find one . &nbsp; LADY PEARL ( tearfully ) Oh ! He was a beautiful man .

The song continues and Triplette leans into Haven . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEHaven , you think we can get Connie out to the rally , too ? Haven smiles and leans back . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONConnie White and Barbara-Jean never appear on the same stage together . Connie might replace Barbara-Jean but that 's it . Then he smiles and adds : &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONAnd as for Haven Hamilton , well  --  I 'll appear wherever Barbara-Jean appears .  --  81  --  He leans back and takes a drink of milk as Triplette nods to himself and says resignedly . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEOkay . Across the table , Barnett storms on . &nbsp; BARNETTI got a good mind to take you outside . With my wife in the hospital , you puttin ' that shit on me ? Connie 's Manager , who perhaps provoked the outburst , wraps it up . &nbsp; CONNIE 'S MANAGERCalm down , Barnett . Calm down and enjoy the show .

They pass the Opryland dancers and make their way to Barnett , who is in combat with the stage managers as Delbert approaches him . &nbsp; BARNETTWhat do you want now ?

Now leave it to me . I 'm gon na stay with this thing . I 'm gon na follow him like a rodent , man . Triplette laughs and onstage , Barbara-Jean walks down the ramp , takes the microphone , and begins to sing . Pvt . Kelly stands in front of the grandstand and Opal enters , looking for a seat in the front row . Finally , she sits in the aisle by Pvt . Kelly and several Shriners . The grandstand is full and quiet through the next two choruses of her song , " Tape Deck In His Tractor . " As she comes to the end , the applause starts and lasts as the musicians seque into the next song , " Careless Disrespect . " As she starts to sing again , Kenny enters and stands next to Pvt . Kelly , as there are no seats left . He watches Barbara-Jean intently . Opal leans over to Pvt . Kelly with her microphone . &nbsp; OPALHave you been in Vietnam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; OPALOh yes , you have . I can tell by your face . Was it awful ? &nbsp; PVT . KELLY ( shakes his head ) It was kinda hot and wet . &nbsp; OPALBeing a trained killer , do you carry a gun ?  --  103  --  &nbsp; PVT . KELLYJust airborne is all . You think maybe I could hear Barbara-Jean sing ? &nbsp; OPALOh , excuse me . The song continues to the end . The music goes out , the applause comes up , and she begins to talk to the audience , while the musicians vamp . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANLast night I thanked my lucky stars that I could be here to sing for you . And I heard on the radio the cutest little boy . The musicians stop vamping and she continues . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANHe was nine years old and you know how sometimes the DJ 'll play a tune and ask everybody to phone in and say how they like it , you know ? And , uh , I was listening to it and , uh , they asked for callers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' the song had voices in the background like the way they usually back up voices these days sometimes , you know . Sounded like little munchkins ? He called up and the DJ said , And how old are you , son ? An ' the boy said , I 'm nine and I think it 's gon na be a hit. She laughs . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANAnd I thought that was so cute . Because  --  well I can sing like a munchkin myself . I do n't know about you , and I 'm real fond of the Wizard of Oz an ' plus I live out y'know just a ways out here on  --  offa Highway Interstate 24 on the road to Chattanooga so you can see why I kinda related to that and I  --  I du n no , I think me and the boys are gon na strike up another tune for you now . Let 's go , boys .  --  104  --  She turns to the band and they begin again . Barbara-Jean looks up at the sky and puts her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm a-brewing . That 's what my granddaddy used to say before he lost his hearin ' and sometimes he 'd say , Oh gosh , or Durn it , or My word. The musicians stop again and look at one another like she 's gone round the bend . Barnett lifts his glasses to his forehead and watches her . He does n't know what to make of it . Del and Triplette watch her behind Barnett . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANMy granny , she 'd go round the house clickin ' her false teeth to the radio all day . She was a lot of fun and always cooked my favorite roast beef and she was a sweetheart . She raised chickens , too . She , uh  --  in fact , did ya ever hear a chicken sound ? You know how chickens go ? She makes a chicken sound . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANHere chick , chick , chick , chick , chick , chick , here chick , chick , chick . Well , anyway I guess we better strike up this tune before it 's too late . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk again . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANI 'm thinkin ' , y'know , about the  --  first job I ever really got was when Mama  --  The music stops . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEAN. . . my grandma , she , she 's the one who clacked her false teeth to the radio all day . She taught my mama how to sing an ' Mama taught me . ( MORE )  --  105  --  &nbsp; BARBARA-JEAN ( CONT 'D ) One time she took me down ' cause we was gon na get a new Frigidaire , an ' she took me down to the Frigidaire store where the man was doin ' the advertisin ' , this little record was goin ' round and round an ' my mama told him that I knew how to sing . The audience begins to react , as do Barnett , the band , Triplette , and Delbert . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANHe said if she can learn this tune and comes down and sings it to me , I 'll give y'all a quarter . So Mama and I went home and then what happened  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we went home and I learned both sides of the record in half an hour and we went back there and pranced in real fancy and I told ' im that I 'd learned ' em and he said , well , let me hear this , so I sang ' im both sides of the record instead of just one , so he gave us fifty cents and we went across the street and had us a soda . She laughs . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANEver since then I been workin ' , I do n't  --  I think ever since then I been workin ' and doin ' my . . . At this point , Barnett , deeply concerned , starts down the ramp with two of the dancers to get her . Triplette and Delbert keep watching onstage as Barbara-Jean continues , lost in her mind somewhere . &nbsp; BARNETTCome on , boys , come on . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEAN. . . supportin ' myself  --  anyway . &nbsp; BARNETT ( kindly ) Hey , hey !  --  106  --  She looks at him and cowers slightly , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; BARNETTGonna get you some lemonade , darlin ' . . .

Gim me the mike  --  &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANI ai n't done . &nbsp; BARNETTI know , I know . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANI ai n't done . &nbsp; BARNETT ( gently ) Go get a glass of water . Boys , help her off , all right ? You 'll come back , okay , darlin ' , come on . The boys come forward and start her up the ramp and offstage . She turns and waves to the audience , but the reaction is grim . They catcall , and boo , some even throw things out onto the stage . Pvt . Kelly , heartbroken , shouts to the audience to be still , but to no avail . Barnett talks to the disappointed crowd . &nbsp; BARNETTAw , come on now , have a heart now . He is interrupted by a holocaust of boos , which continue as he speaks . &nbsp; BARNETTYou do n't mean that , do you ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . &nbsp; BARNETTThat little girl just came out of the hospital  --  did you know that ? That little girl 's in there cryin ' her eyes out ' cause she did n't want to disappoint you .  --  107  --  The sounds against her are more than he can bear . He looks around him and panics , not wanting to cause a breach between the fans and his fragile wife . He makes a desperate move to pacify them . &nbsp; BARNETT ( abruptly ) You all show up at Centennial Park tomorrow at the Parthenon  --  you 'll see her for free as our guest . How 's that , huh ? The boos continue , but the cheers and applause that filter in lead him to believe that it was the right thing to do . &nbsp; BARNETTAll right , let 's hear a welcome  --  a get-well welcome for Barbara-Jean . And as the boos change to applause , Barnett makes his way up the ramp to Delbert and Triplette , who stand , concerned . &nbsp; BARNETTIngrates is all they are . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me trapped out there . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEI know you did , Barnett . &nbsp; BARNETTI want some ground rules . &nbsp; TRIPLETTE ( sincerely ) You name it . &nbsp; BARNETT ( perspiring heavily ) She 's gon na sing first , right ? &nbsp; TRIPLETTERight . &nbsp; BARNETTShe 's gon na be off before that man of yours even shows .  --  108  --  &nbsp; BARNETTI never should have brought her here in the first place . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEFine .

CUT TO : Section Details INT . EXIT INN An intimate home away from home for musicians and their friends , who come out of the audience to perform as often as from the stage .

Bill leans over and whispers to her  --  &nbsp; BILLHis name is Norman . &nbsp; OPALNorman , oh yes , Norman . . . He pours her glass full as Johnny continues his song . &nbsp; OPALOh , thank you so much , Norman . Linnea enters the room from the other side . She stands in the corner trying to adjust to the light and sees Tom . She spots him in a direction away from Bill and Mary . She works her way through the crowd to Tom , but from yet another direction L.A. Joan , in black wig and gypsy skirt , darts in and sits down next to him . Linnea turns , goes to the back of the room , and sits down in a wooden booth .

Mary continues to look at the stage as Bill drives on . &nbsp; OPALOh yes , I thought you understood that . &nbsp; BILLUh huh . Where did you go to bed with him ? The vocalist onstage has finished , and through the applause he announces that his friend Tom Frank is in the audience and has agreed to do a couple of numbers . Bill and Mary look amazed and Opal is thrilled . &nbsp; OPALSpeak of the devil ! &nbsp; BILLWell , I 'll be damned ! Tom makes his way to the stage as the audience continues to clap .

Opal leads the applause and pats Mary enthusiastically . &nbsp; OPALOh , you must . As they get up and make their way to the stage , the audience breaks into a ragged version of " It Do n't Worry Me . " Tom nods at Bill , and Mary 's eyes bore through him . They take their positions and begin " Since You 've Gone , " with Mary playing most of the song to Tom .

RED BARN DINNER THEATER - NIGHT Delbert stands in his beige plaid suit and white shoes inside the ring of red-and-white-checkered tables talking to an all-male audience .

Joan from her part of the room sits and smiles . His focus goes into the audience and , now all alone in the booth , Linnea watches him . A particular kind of quiet takes over in the room , and Tom caresses the notes as he sings . For a while , each of the younger women in Tom 's life takes the song in as being meant for her . But about midway through , Mary detects another stakeout . She looks back , which causes Opal to peer around looking for the receiver . L.A. Joan looks around , saddened by his lack of interest .

RED BARN DINNER THEATER - NIGHT The applause is loud for Sueleen , no doubt because she has stopped singing . Unfortunately , this encourages her and she moves into the next song quickly . As she does , she removes her cape . There are a few cheers hoping that she is getting on with the business at hand . Instead , she continues singing the too-slow tempo , no-pitch rendition of " One , I Love You . " The men are no longer polite and begin to boo and throw things onto the stage . She sticks it out for what seems an inordinately long time . Triplette , who 's afraid they will lose pledges , turns to Delbert , who answers his look . &nbsp; DELDid you tell Trout exactly what you wanted ?  --  116  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTE ( bristling and passing the buck ) Did I tell Trout ?

Sueleen ignores the possibility that a striptease was ever intended . &nbsp; SUELEENI 'm a singer . Triplette 's eyes roll back in his head . Then , he reaches over and grabs her by the arm and lies to her sincerely . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEListen  --  you go on down and finish the show like you told Trout you would and I 'll set it up so you can sing at the Parthenon . &nbsp; SUELEEN ( tempted ) I get to sing at the Parthenon with Barbara-Jean ?  --  117  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEYes , now go on down and finish ... &nbsp; SUELEEN ( defensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Barbara-Jean . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEAw , I know you are . You ca n't miss . &nbsp; DELThese fellows really like you , honey . She walks down the stairs accompanied by cheers and applause . For the first time , she determines it was n't her singing they liked at all . The band goes into some basic " take-it-off " music and she starts with the gloves and tosses them to the audience . Not knowing exactly what to do next , she undoes the top of her gown which falls to her waist revealing her peach-colored brassiere , and suddenly she knows that she is n't in a dream , that St. Theresa wo n't save her and that in order to survive she must proceed . From the bra she pulls out first one sweat sock and then the other . Both go out into the surprised audience . Angry and scared , she slips the dress to the floor and , half stumbling , tosses it to the eager crowd of men , who could n't like her more if they tried . Next comes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to circle the stage , a slim piano fanfare begins . She doffs her yellow nylon panties and walks buck naked up the stairs to a cheering , standing ovation . Albuquerque , who is overjoyed by the unexpected performance , stands outside the curtains clapping as Sueleen passes by her numbly , her dignity left out there in the middle of the floor somewhere .

Linnea washes in the basin . &nbsp; TOMListen , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When ? &nbsp; TOMTonight . &nbsp; GIRL ( V.O. ) Oh , Tom , I ca n't do that . They discuss her job , his wanting her to quit her job , her reasons for not wanting to , as Linnea searches under the covers for and finds her underpants tangled on Tom 's foot . She smiles at him and puts them in her purse . Then she walks to Tom , who leans forward to her , shielding the mouthpiece for a moment , and then they kiss . Linnea moves to the door with no regrets , having taken the best Tom has to offer . She turns before she leaves , and makes the " I 'm happy I met you " sign .

Wade starts down the stairs shaking his head . &nbsp; WADEShit . Do n't know why I stick around when she makes me so goddamn mad I could spit . CUT TO : Section Details EXT . SKY - NIGHT Flashing across the sky , we see " New Roots for the Nation  --  Hal Phillip Walker " appear , one letter at a time , on a news blimp . We hear Howard K. Smith in the b.g . &nbsp; HOWARD K. SMITH ( V.O. ) Little more than a year ago , a man named Hal Phillip Walker excited a group of college students with some questions . Have you stood on a high and windy hill and heard the acorns drop and roll ? Have you walked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DISSOLVE TO :  --  125  --  CLOSEUP - HOWARD K. SMITH - DAY ( TUESDAY , FIFTH DAY ) On television we see Howard K. Smith , as a woman and her family sit in the f.g. , waiting for the festivities to begin at the Parthenon in Centennial Park . &nbsp; HOWARD K. SMITHDoes Christmas smell like oranges to you ? Well in the commencement speech such questions were fitting perhaps , but hardly the material with which to launch a presidential campaign . EXT . PARTHENON ( CENTENNIAL PARK ) - DAY Now we see a large stage platform in front of a huge American flag . Under the flag , a long Hal Phillip Walker banner and a podium with a " New Roots for the Nation " poster on it . The large tents along the side provide food and drink and shelter for the hundreds of fans , who are starting to make their way to the park . Sound and equipment men crawl over the stage and lawn , setting up apparatus , as the Walker truck pulls up and parks next to Tommy Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parthenon itself . At either end of it are machines whereby , for a quarter , one can hear a complete dramatization of how they came to build it in the first place , affording Nashville with the title , " The Athens of the South . " &nbsp; HOWARD K. SMITHHal Phillip Walker is in a way a mystery man . Out of nowhere , with a handful of students and scarcely any professionals , he 's managed to win three presidential primaries and is given a fighting change to take a fourth  --  Tennessee . A win in that state would take on added significance , for only once in the last fifty years has Tennessee failed to vote for a winning presidential candidate . No doubt , many Americans , especially party-liners , wish that Hal Phillip Walker would go away , disappear like the natural frost and come again at some more convenient season . But whatever he may be doing , it seems sure that Hal Phillip Walker is not going away . For there is genuine appeal and it . . . &nbsp; HOWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw courage of this man running for president  --   --  126  --   --  willing to battle vast oil companies , eliminate subsidies to farmers , tax churches , abolish the electoral college , change the national anthem , and remove lawyers from government , especially from Congress . Well , at this point it would be wise to say most of us do n't know the answer to Hal Phillip Walker . But to answer one of his questions : as a matter of fact , Christmas has always smelled like oranges to me . On the back side of the Parthenon , we see an official-looking cavalcade of black limousines , police cars and motorcycles enter the park with their lights on . One of them has small American flags on the fenders . The Tricycle Man drives into the park past Opal and a throng of people hurrying to get a place . On the other side of the park we hear Wade in his truck , yelling to the oncoming traffic that they 're going the wrong way . In the b.g. , we hear the song  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls up and stops behind the Parthenon , their lights continue to flash and Triplette gets out of the car with flags on the fenders and talks to its other occupant , Hal Phillip Walker , whom we can not see . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEYou may have to sit out here for an hour or so ; I hope not  --  &nbsp; WALKER ( O.S. ) That 's all right , John ; it 'll give me time to work on my speech . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEOkay , thank you  --  Triplette shakes hands with several police and plainclothesmen who stand beside the car . Then he spots Delbert coming across the lawn . &nbsp; DELHey , John , how are you ?  --  127  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEHow are you ? &nbsp; DELA. . . can I say hello to  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEHe 's working on his speech . Come on , I want to get this going . We 'll do that later . Is Barnett here ? They climb the high steps of the Parthenon , looking like two ants approaching a hill for just a moment , and then disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , Delbert is telling the building 's history . &nbsp; DELThis was originally made of lumber and plaster of Paris . They built it for the Centennial Celebration in 1876 and the people liked it so much they did n't want it torn down . Then Nashville got to be called Athens of the South. ( as Triplette laughs ) People sort of took to that . Then they rebuilt it . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEThis building ? &nbsp; DELRight before I was born . They have reached the platform and Barnett , in his usual attire , greets them , perspiring . &nbsp; BARNETTWhoo ! It 's gon na be a scorcher . &nbsp; TRIPLETTE ( to Delbert ) Will the park police control all this ? &nbsp; DELRight.  --  128  --  &nbsp; BARNETTDelbert , hey , Delbert , get over here . Come on , we do n't need all these chairs , do we ? This ai n't no band here . By now the red-white-and-blue buntinged platform has filled with Chamber of Commerce people , media people and photographers . Suddenly , Barnett stops dead in his tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DELWhat 's the matter , man ? &nbsp; BARNETTI do n't  --  I do n't believe it ! &nbsp; DELWhat 's the matter ? Barnett points to the banner and begins to shout . &nbsp; BARNETTAre you guys jerkin ' me around ? Do you see what I see or not ? &nbsp; DELWhat are you talking about ? Barnett move to Triplette . &nbsp; BARNETTWhat the hell is that sign doin ' up there , Triplette , huh ? Now , come on we had some ground rules , am I right ? No political signs , no advertising , no nothin '  --  What the hell are you doin ' ? A photographer comes in and snaps a picture , as Triplette tries to pacify him with " We 'll take care of it . " Barnett knows better . He pushes the photographer aside roughly . &nbsp; BARNETTGo about your business ! Now come on , lemme hear it  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEI have abided. . .  --  129  --  &nbsp; BARNETT ( irate ) I laid down some ground rules . . . &nbsp; TRIPLETTE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency of this country sitting out there in his car like a fool because of your ground rules . &nbsp; BARNETTHe can sit out in the sun and parch for all I care ! My wife ai n't well , is she ? And I brought her out of the hospital bed to be here . And you gave me some ground rules . Well , you 're full of it just like your , your man ! Triplette loses control . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEI have abided by every ground rule that you laid down ! &nbsp; BARNETTExcept one . What is that thing up there , huh ? What is that ? She ai n't gon na appear here with that sign up ! &nbsp; TRIPLETTEI have busted my ass for you this last week , Barnett . &nbsp; BARNETTWell , I 'm gon na bust your ass , too  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEAnd I 'm through with it ! Now you can take your wife and you can take a walk . . . &nbsp; BARNETTI 'll give you a. . .  --  130  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTEAnd I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's not going to appear . &nbsp; TRIPLETTEThat 's right ! &nbsp; BARNETTYou will huh ? Well , go on and do it ! &nbsp; TRIPLETTETake a walk and I 'll do it ! &nbsp; BARNETTYou 'd do that , huh ? &nbsp; TRIPLETTEI 'll do it ! &nbsp; BARNETTYou 'd put a knife in my wife 's back like that , man ? &nbsp; TRIPLETTEYou 're putting the knife in her back , buster ! You 're doing it ! Now I have not got time to take the goddamn sign down and put it back up . Barnett pulls in and reverses rationales . &nbsp; BARNETTWhat the hell are you hollerin ' about in front of all these people , huh ? You trying to embarrass me ? And Triplette regains control of the issue  --  &nbsp; TRIPLETTE ( quietly ) I 'm trying to be heard . Just trying to be heard . As Barnett discusses moving the chairs off the stage , one wonders how many times in how many situations he has reversed original issues , or if this is the first time . Triplette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Delbert.  --  131  --  &nbsp; BARNETTWhere is that rat ? What 're you hiding back there for , you little rat , huh ? CUT TO : Section Details EXT . CEMETERY - DAY Atop a very green , tree-covered hilltop , a small group of people sit at graveside listening to Esther Green 's eulogy . A mist has gathered around them and they seem cut off from the rest of the world . &nbsp; MINISTER . . . . and grant us all to serve thee by day that we may find eternal fellowship with them through Him who died and rose again for us all , Jesus Christ , our Lord . Amen . Kenny is there . Last night , before he went to bed , he made Mr. Green supper and brought it to him on a tray in bed . L.A. Joan did n't come home , so she is n't at the funeral . Suddenly , Mr. Green stands and starts down the hill . Kenny gets up and tries to stop him . &nbsp; KENNYMr . Green , where are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; GREENShe needs to show some respect to Esther ! &nbsp; MINISTEROur help is in the name of the Lord . In heaven and on earth . . . Mr. Green breaks from Kenny 's grasp and continues down the hill . Kenny follows him . CUT TO :  --  132  --  Section Details EXT . PARTHENON ( CENTENNIAL PARK ) - DAY For just a moment the huge American flag FILLS the SCREEN and we hear the announcer . &nbsp; VOICE ( V.O. ) Now , ladies and gentlemen , Barbara-Jean and Haven Hamilton ! There are cheers and applause as they break into the song , " One , I Love You . " Haven 's white rhinestone-on-white tailored Western suit stands out against the American flag , as does Barbara-Jean 's demure , white , organdy pinafore . She is , in fact , radiant , doing what she does best  --  safe for as long as the song lasts from any of the conflict that plagues her , supported by her friend , Haven , who shares her ability to awaken people 's hopes and dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism . In the audience , the Tricycle Man moves down to the platform and people look at him curiously . Star pushes his way through the crowd in another direction , still in pursuit of Albuquerque , who sits curled up on the edge of the platform unnoticed . Behind her stands Linnea , whose legs feel a little weak this morning , her at place in the choir . Further back stand Tom and Mary , who ca n't find Bill . Sueleen Gay , dressed in pink satin , Martha Washington-style , stands firmly against one of the pillars , mouthing the words as Barbara-Jean sings . Wade makes his way through the audience as does Opal , craning her neck and still trying to find the truth . Pvt . Glen Kelly stands front and center to the platform . L.A. Joan , now in a platinum wig and turban , holds Bill 's hand and leads him through the crowd . Mr. Green has arrived with Kenny who is pessimistic about finding L.A. Joan in the crowd . But Green , having had a belly full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives up and with his ever-present violin case walks through the applauding audience .  --  133  --  On stage , Haven kisses Barbara-Jean 's hand and the band segues into the next song , " My Idaho Home . " Barbara Jean thanks everyone and starts to sing by herself . Bud and Lady Pearl stand onstage busily putting several bunches of white carnations together to give to Barbara-Jean . Tommy Brown and his wife stand between members of the Chamber of Commerce and Triplette who makes some sort of remark that they both laugh at . Delbert is there , but has swallowed himself up in the city fathers to avoid confrontation with anyone on any level , especially Barnett who stands behind the platform looking out into the audience of ingrates who picked up on his free invitation . Kenny stands watching Barbara-Jean as intently as he did at the Opry , and reaches for key he wears around his neck as Pvt . Kelly shifts his duffel bag from one hand to the other . Opal , having run out of film , has found a television truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera while chatting it up with the boys . Kenny hurriedly opens the violin case and takes something out . For a moment he watches the huge flag billow softly behind Barbara-Jean as a cloud passes over the sun . As the sun comes out again , she closes her eyes and is lost in her own reveries , not seeing Pvt . Kelly , who stands mesmerized . Or Kenny , who ca n't take his eyes off the stage . Or the rest of the audience , who breaks into deafening applause as she says . &nbsp; BARBARA-JEANFor Mamma and Daddy . Thank you . Thank you so much , ladies and gentlemen . Thank you . Haven walks out onstage , arms raised . The carnations are in one hand and he takes hold of Barbara-Jean with the other . They make a wide-sweeping bow , as people on stage and in the audience express their love for her the only way they can . Then she drops , like a beautiful bird shot in mid-flight.  --  134  --  Haven falls too , punctured by two SHARP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem arbitrary . In the moment when everyone must try and comprehend what has happened , Pvt . Kelly has turned , seen the source of the gunshot , and forces the THIRD SHOT airborne as he grabs the assassin 's arms . It is Kenny , who is unconvinced somehow that he has killed the right enemy . Whatever Kenny says is obliterated , as other men and police rush forward to help Pvt . Kelly , swallowing up Kenny and his broken vision . Onstage , there are screams and stunned silence , all of it confused and chaotic . Barnett makes his way to her crumpled form pathetically , as Haven , who has lost his toupee in the melee , takes charge with extraordinary gentleness . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONAll right now , you get her . Get her here , Bud , help her up now . Come on , I 'm all right , here we go . Bud , Tom , Barnett , Tommy Brown , members of the choir , and others pick her up with care and walk through the columns as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARNETT ( quietly ) Oh , man , I ca n't stop that blood , man . Haven is onstage , oblivious to his blood-soaked arm . He talks into the microphone to try to cut through the chaos in the audience . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONY'all take it easy now . Police security has suddenly increased and Hal Phillip Walker and the black limousine cavalcade exit at high speed behind a police car whose SIREN SCREAMS into the continuing chaos . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONThis is n't Dallas , this is Nashville ... You show ' em what we 're made of . They ca n't do this to us here in Nashville .  --  135  --  The crowd responds a little but not much . Delbert comes up behind him . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONOkay , everybody sing ! Come on now , sing ... ( aside ) I wish they had  --  &nbsp; DELI think you ... Let , let me help you . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTON ( looking around ) No I 'm fine ... I 'm  --  you sing . You stay here and sing . &nbsp; DELHaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thrusts the microphone into the nearby hand of Albuquerque . &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONSing ! &nbsp; DELHaven  --  &nbsp; HAVEN HAMILTONI 'm all right ... And Delbert leads him off the stage . &nbsp; DELIs there anyone down here can help us ? Albuquerque begins to sing tentatively , still caught up in the event that 's just taken place . Somehow , in the scramble , Green runs into L.A. Joan who is crying , and he grabs her arm roughly and leads her out of the crowd . Bill rushes onto the stage to Mary and they leave immediately . Opal wanders through the crowd asking if anyone can tell her what happened  --  she was in the truck talking when the shots were fired .  --  136  --  Triplette stands looking out somewhere , guilty , hollow , finished before he has begun . Albuquerque has found her voice and talks to the audience as the choir trickles in and joins her . &nbsp; ALBUQUERQUECome on , everybody , sing . Come on ! ( singing ) ' It do n't worry me . It do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving them strength . Finally they respond and their panic turns around on itself . Linnea stands devastated , somehow unable to reconcile any of it with the song . Triplette starts offstage past Albuquerque who scoops up the white carnations and throws them into the audience , past Sueleen Gay , who still waits in the wings , and silently past Delbert , who pushes by Sueleen to get to Linnea so he can take her home to the children . &nbsp; DELCome on , honey , come on . Pvt . Kelly , who has been numbly standing next to the platform , turns and walks out through the crowd . He has to catch a bus back to Fort Campbell  --  his five-day pass is up at six . By now , Albuquerque , the choir , and the audience are singing , " It Do n't Worry Me . " For a moment , we see the faces of mothers and fathers and children and babies . Then we PULL BACK and see the whole event as the CAMERA PANS UP TO the sky signifying ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
