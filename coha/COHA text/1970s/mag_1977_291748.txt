How could a power system that many people thought was made fail-safe after the Northeast 's great 1965 blackout plunge New York City into helpless darkness once again ? It may take months of investigation to get the complete answer . But at week 's end , an outline of the falling-domino sequence of failures that led to the total collapse had begun to emerge . <P> Like other major utilities in the U.S. and Canada , New York 's embattled Consolidated Edison Co. ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) not only has its own electrical generating plants but is plugged into a larger regional pool of power producers . Depending on the electricity needs of its 9 million customers in New York City and neighboring Westchester County , Con Ed can either 1 ) rely largely on its own generators , or 2 ) buy power from neighboring utilities if the load-or demand from its users-is high , or 3 ) sell off surplus electricity to other companies . Yet those choices are complicated by another fact : electrical energy can not economically be stored . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system must be quickly compensated for elsewhere along the line . Indeed , the decisions of controllers to buy or sell electricity , or to switch in additional generators , require such split-second timing and are so complex that large utilities like Con Ed have increasingly computerized their operations . <P> On the night of the blackout , the New York metropolitan area was sweltering under a blanket of hot , humid air . With air conditioners whirring everywhere and electrical load high-though still far below the levels expected later this summer-Con Ed was importing from neighboring utilities about one-third of the electricity it was delivering to its customers . That in itself was not unusual . In the battle to keep its rates from soaring even higher . Con Ed has lately been buying more and more electricity from nearby companies that can provide cheaper power . Yet what made Con Ed especially vulnerable that soggy evening was a series of highly improbable natural events- " acts of God . " as one spokesman called them . <P> A severe summer thunderstorm had just swept across the green suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point No. 3 nuclear power plant overlooking the Hudson River . At 8:37 p.m. , according to Con Ed 's preliminary analysis , flashes of lightning knocked out two 345-kilovolt lines . That immediately cut off all the electricity from the 900-megawatt Indian Point facility , and the nuclear plant was promptly and safely shut down . Then , while duty officers at Con Ed 's main control center in Manhattan-a huge , display-filled room somewhat like Mission Control in Houston-scrambled to make up for the power loss , lightning struck again . At 8:56 p.m. bolts knocked out two more upstate 345-kilovolt lines in Westchester that bring in power from upstate New York and New England . Three minutes later , lightning knocked out yet another line . Worse still , circuit breakers designed to reset automatically after the enormous voltage surge caused by a lightning bolt apparently failed to close . By now the utility had suffered a massive loss of some 2,000 megawatts-more than a third of its electrical load that night .                @ @ @ @ @
