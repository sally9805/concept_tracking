When Gov ' s away , she can play <P> If nothing else , Thelma Stovall has found a novel way to make the Governor of Kentucky stick to his old Kentucky home . If he wanders too far or tarries too long beyond the state 's borders , he had better look back and ask , " What 's Thelma up to now ? " <P> Stovall , 59 , a modest but tough Democratic politician , struck first in 1959 . She was secretary of state then , the third-ranking office in Kentucky , and she found one day that both Governor Happy Chandler and his Lieutenant Governor were away . By law , that made her the boss . So she pardoned three prisoners , including a holdup man sentenced to up to life for stealing $28 . <P> Still holding elective office 19 years later , Thelma pounced again last March , after she had moved up to Lieutenant Governor . When the current Governor , Democrat Julian Carroll , left the state briefly , Stovall exercised her temporary veto authority to kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Equal Rights Amendment . The veto stuck . <P> But last November , Thelma outdid herself . She had watched restlessly as Governor Carroll , a Presbyterian lay preacher and political gadfly , proved so prone to travel that he became known as " the Flying Deacon . " She also felt he had failed to provide solid leadership on tax cuts over Kentucky 's ineffective legislature , which meets only 60 days every two years . When the legislature left Frankfort without doing anything to soothe the state 's increasingly irate taxpayers , Thelma started watching the Governor 's schedule . Aha , she spotted a trip . She polished her plans . <P> Carroll was off blithely chairing a Georgia training session for new Governors when Stovall seized the executive reins to call a special session of the legislature . It would , she decreed , face up to the state 's tax burden . Moreover , she had a program of her own : end the state taxes on water and heating fuel for residences ; lower the state income tax ; freeze almost all property taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outraged , Governor Carroll returned after two days ' absence to fight Stovall 's use of his own powers . When the legislators assembled last month , the Governor ignored the special session and fought any tax reduction on the grounds that the state could not afford it . But after the legislators grilled Carroll 's financial aides and decided that taxes were indeed too high and could be cut , he surrendered to Thelma 's coup . Last week he addressed a joint session of the legislature and endorsed much of the tax-cutting program . Some form of tax relief is expected to win final approval this week . <P> A popular tax cut was not the only thing on Thelma 's mind . As she well knew , her desire to shake things up while the boss is away had made her a political heroine . She is now one of the favorites in this year 's race to succeed Carroll , who is ineligible to succeed himself . If she survives the May primary and wins in November , one thing is likely : Thelma Stovall will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion .
