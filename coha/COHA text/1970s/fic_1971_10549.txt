FOOLS ' TOWERaway from Rosa but he was also frightened . Sigmund wondered of what . The petroleum lamp had been pulled low and cast a warm glow of light over the table . On the wall over the buffet with its gleaming array of trays and silver service were framed photographs of the " bourgeois Ministry , " Herbst , Giskra , Linger , Berger and others from the university 's graduates : it had been one of the triumphs of the uprising and street fightingin Vienna in 1848 that the merchant middle class had at last been allowed to hold important government posts , among them several Jews . Sigmund had been so impressed , sitting opposite these imposing portraits each day at dinner , that toward the end of his preparatory training he had thought perhaps he might like to study jurisprudence . Reading Goethe 's Fragment Upon Nature had changed all that : " Nature ! We are surrounded by her , embraced by her  --  impossible to release ourselves from her and impossible to enter more deeply into her . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed before ; what has existed returns not again , everything is new and yet always old .

She is forever building , forever demolishing , and her workshopis not to be found . . . . She is the sole artist . . . . " Eli was holding forth . " The post of editor of an economics journal is opening up ; Professor von Stein says he is going to recommend me for it at the end of the year . I 've had some conversations with the Austrian Minister of Commerce ; one of their officials is retiring and they 're considering me for the job .

Which of the three jobs should I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know you have enough energy to fill them . " " Then perhaps I ought to go to America ? They like people who can do three jobs simultaneously . " A discussion broke out as to which was the best country in which to live . Sigmund , who was the only one who had been to a foreign land , said : " England . I 'll tell you why : in England everything is allowed except what is specifically forbidden . In Germany everything is forbidden exceptwhat is specifically allowed . " " What about Vienna ? " asked Ignaz . Jakob replied quickly , " In Vienna everything that is forbidden is allowed . " He added , " I heard one at my Stammtisch today . " His eyes lightedFOOLS ' TOWER 41with warmth . Jakob loved the Viennese custom of the round table of friends who met every day at the same hour , in the same coffeehouse , at the same table . It was here in the brown leather booths behind etched-glass doors , the walls lined with racks of newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two neckties for his birthday . The next day , to show his appreciation , the son wore one of the ties . His mother cried , What 's the matter , do n't you like the other one ? " Everyone laughed except Amalie , who never could find any humor in jokes told at her expense . Jakob blew her a kiss across the table . Sigmund had suddenly lost his appetite and laid down his fork . This was the first time since the Saturday walk in Modling , and their kiss , that he had seen Martha . On Sunday , because of the twin almonds they had found , he had sent her a copy of David Copper field and she had sent him a cake she had baked herself , the secret gifts passing from the Bernays and the Freud houses through the kindness of Eli . Martha did not know about his disappointment at the hands of Professor Brucke . He could not fool her , for he had made too ringing a statement about his love for research . Yet neither could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to become engaged to Martha before she returned to Hamburg for the summer , the following Sunday . Suppose she asked , " Why have you suddenly changed your mind ? Are you not a stayer ? " He said in a voice that came out a little larger than he had intended , " Eli , you are not the only one who is changing jobs . . . . I 'm returning to the Krankenhaus when the new courses start in August . Within a few years I should be able to cure you of every known ailment except acute alcoholism . " Martha turned full face to search for his meaning . He felt her mind probing his . " Then you are going to become a doctor ! " " Of course he 's going to become a doctor , " said Amalie . " Why else would he take his medical degree ? " Martha groped for his hand under the table . His confidence returned . When all eyes were on Ignaz , who was telling about the Sanskrit fable he had translated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . He whispered : " Among primitive tribes there is a superstition that , if you possess something that belongs to another person , that person is in your power . It 's magic . You will them to do something and they can not resist . " " Now that you have me in your power , what is it that you are going to will me to do ? " " If I revealed it you might break the spell . " 42 . POOLS ' TOWER " So easily ? " She was beautiful when she smiled as she did now , teasingly , but with affection . " When you worked in those alchemist laboratories , did n't you find an even stronger magic that put one person in the power of another ? " " That was n't an apple you were peeling the first time I saw you . It was me . Round and round in those long , delicate fingers , cutting away my cover in one continuous ribbon , right down to the core . " 9 . Two days later Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'll walk you home . " Not unexpectedly , Eli invited him in for a cup of coffee . Mrs. EmmelineBernays received him politely . She and Amalie Freud had been friends , but that did not reconcile Mrs. Bernays to the fact that her son Eli had fallen in love with Anna Freud . Mrs. Bernays liked Anna but she thought it an act of lunacy for a bright and promising young man like Eli , whom the matchmakers were pursuing with offers of up to fifty thousand dollars , to marry a girl with no dowry whatever . Had she thought that Minna was serious about Ignaz Schonberg or Martha interested in Sigmund Freud , two penniless Yeshivabucher , perennial students , the hair under her scheitel would have turned white . Mrs. Bernays ' family , the Philipps , had come from Sweden . Her husband'sfamily were solid Hamburg merchants and professors . Berman 's father , Isaac , had been chief rabbi of the German-Jewish community . His brother Jacob moved on to the University of Bonn as professor and chief librarian . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Munich by King Ludwig II of Bavaria , who created a special chair for him . The Philipp family had been equally prosperous and respected . Though Emmeline Bernays , at fifty-two , was an old woman by generalstandards , she had refused , symbolically , to practice the Hindu custom of suttee after her husband 's death , maintaining that she was too young and vigorous to go up in flames . She insisted that she was now head of the Bernays family , which brought her into conflict with her son , who maintainedthat since he was the man of the family and supporting them he was entitled to be the master of the household . As Martha served the coffee and Kip f eln , Mrs. Bernays got off on her favorite subject of returning with her family to live in Hamburg and the charming suburb of Wandsbek , about which she had been quarreling with Eli . She was a bright , educated and disciplined woman . Her outstanding passion was a detestation of Vienna . POOLS ' TOWER 43 " Ever since the Congress of Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of wild , fun-loving live today , we die tomorrow ' gaiety , " she exclaimed . " It 's a contorted myth . Actually most Viennese live in despair ; the music , the songs , the eternal waltzing , the forced , senseless laughter , are a tattered cloak they wear to hide their nakedness from the world . It is true In Berlin things are serious but not hopeless ; in Vienna things are hopeless but not serious . ' In Hamburg we do not pretend to be gay when we are sad or troubled . We do n't end each sentence with a foolish trilling as they do , though they may be announcing the death of their mother . If we do n't like a person we do n't treat him in our most ingratiatingmanner , then stick a gossip-knife through the ribs of his reputation . I do not care to spend the rest of my life turning realities into appearances . I am a Swede and North German , and I refuse to laugh the rest of my days out of existence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned to her son . " Eli , you are remaining home ? Then I will go for a visit with Frau Popp . " Eli made desultory talk for a few moments and then , his duty done , said , " Excuse me , I have to write some notes for Professor von Stein . " Martha was sitting in her favorite brown chair . Sigmund moved to the hassock at her feet . The Bernays apartment , on the Matthausgasse in the Third District , close to the Wien Fluss and Stadtpark , was a comfortable one , somewhat overstuffed with all the solid furniture the Bernayses had brought from Hamburg . On the walls were paintings of forest scenes and seascapes from an early Hamburg school of painters . " Why are you going to Wandsbek ? " he asked . She turned a little pale . " It was planned . . . some time ago .... It 's a way to visit the family and have a summer in the country . There are lovely groves to walk in . You would like them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could that properly be considered an invitation ? " She opened her eyes wide , one corner of her mouth twitching in a mischievous smile . Every fiber of his being yearned to embrace her , to use in his own interests the few moments Eli was affording them . Yet his background conquered him . Inside his head a thought ricocheted : " It would be a violation of hospitality . " Eli returned . " How about a stroll in the Prater ? " It was a clear mid-June dusk , the sun flooding the western sky with roselavendersas it made a spectacular setting . Eli bounded about , never in their sight but actually not out of it . They entered at the Praterstern , then walked arm in arm along a side path of the Hauptallee . Double rows of chestnut trees lined the center road busy with handsome carriages , the women gowned in double-skirted dresses and big hats , the men in dark44 FOOLS ' TOWERsuits and top hats , the drivers smartly turned out in short light brown coats with hats of matching brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaisergarten with its carefully tended lawns , clipped trees and bushes , and found themselves in the Volks Prater , the amusement area , crowded with visitors from every part of the Empire : men from Croatia selling wooden spoons and baskets , women from Czechoslovakia in misshapen country boots with rough straw trays strapped around their necks , hawking carved animals and toys ; the country people from Bohemia and Moravia looking as though they had walked every mile ; the Poles selling slices of black blood sausage ; the boys from Silesia and Bosnia selling glassware and porcelain cups ; the cooks from Bohemia on the arms of their newly found soldier friends , headed for the pavilion . On their left a women 's band was playingat the expensive restaurant , the Eisvogel . On their right small children were swinging in a rocking boat . Ahead was the famous Furststheater with a poster reading : " Die Harhe Poldi . " Martha asked : " In what way is Poldi not very friendly ? " " It 's a euphemism for not very obliging . " Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay eight gulden , three dollars and twenty cents , to watch a girl who is not going to be obliging ? " Sigmund missed his step completely . " Why , Dr. Sigmund Freud , I do believe I shocked you . " He put an arm about her waist and hugged her . They had reached the Rondeau where a crowd was assembled in front of Calafati , the giant revolving Chinese statue which delighted the children . They were now in the center of the fun area with its merry-gorounds , mini-giant wheels , shooting galleries where soldiers shot clay pigeons to win roses for their girls , exhibitions of the Siamese Twins , the Thick Girl , the Hairy Woman , and all around them beer gardens and restaurants . They turned back to the Grosse Zufahrtsstrasse and , as Eli suddenly materialized , stopped at the Liesinger Bier Depot and listened to the musicfrom the two famous restaurants opposite , Zum Weissen Rossl and Schweizerhaus . In the street between them thronged the young girls in their brightly colored dirndls , the Bavarian women in Dirndlkleid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying out their wares in a familiar cacophony , the woman carp baker , the coffee Sieder , the Limonehandler , the Schokoladenmacher , the fruit sellers and vendors of salads and radishes , the water pourer . Sigmund bought them each a portion of baked carp with a Mohnkipfel , a poppy seed roll , while Eli ordered mugs of beer . They murmured , " Prosit ! " FOOLS ' TOWER 45Sigmund gazed across the table at Martha , at the almost fragile oval and the warm eyes so serious and honest . His feelings went out to her in a rush of joy and compassion . He felt a need to protect her . Yet he had not even been given permission to call her du . She was leaving on Sunday for the summer . That gave him only two more days . He was chilled with fear that she would get away without his being able to make a declaration of his love ; that he might lose her to someone else before he could see her again . Martha broke the silence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like best , going into a private practice you had not planned on ? " He knew that his answer would be important to her . " Yes . Love is the flame ; work is the fuel . " She passed this sentiment by , knitting her brows as she leaned toward him . Was it the eau de cologne that tightened his insides , or the natural scent of her hair in which he had buried his face for that one marvelous instant in Modling ? " Then this is something you must do ? It had to come , sooner or later ? " " Without doubt I must find a way , as quickly as possible , of helping my parents and the girls . Alexander too , because he has two more years at the Gymnasium . " She studied his face thoughtfully before speaking again . " You do n't sound . . . unhappy . . . chagrined . I do n't know why you changed so suddenly but apparently you are reconciled . " " Yes and no . I will practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably in nervous diseases , since this is Josef Breuer 's field and he will be there to help me . But at the same time I do not intend to abandon research . I will always want part of my life for exploring the science of medicine . I have the energy , the strength , the determination . . . " She put a hand on his , fondly , as a loyal friend might . And he knew that soon , though not at this moment when they were surrounded by eating , drinking , laughing crowds ; but very soon now , he would have to make his declaration , the one that would determine his happiness . When he returned home he sat down at the desk in the tiny Kabinett . He had found the German language strong and precise for expressing thoughts in science . Now he found it tender and evocative when speaking of love . Dear Martha , how you have changed my life . It was so wonderful today in your home , near to you . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no end . I dare not write what moved me . I could not believe that I should not see your dear features for months , nor can I believe I am running no danger when fresh46 FOOLS ' TOWERimpressions affect Martha . So much of hope , doubt , happiness and privation have been condensed into the narrow space of two weeks . But there is no longer mistrust on my side ; had I doubted ever so little I should never have revealed my feelings in these days . . . . It wo n't come . I can not say here to Martha what I still have to say . I lack the confidence to finish the sentence , the line that the girl 's glance and gesture forbids or allows . I will only allow myself to say one thing : the last time that we see each other I should like to address the loved one , the adored one , as Du , ' and be assured of a relationshipwhich perhaps will have for long to be veiled in secrecy .

She would leave on Sunday without answering and he would be left dangling for the entire summer . Nor could he invent another pretext for visiting the Bernays home so soon . Mrs. Bernays would descend on him from her " arrogant Hamburgian heights " and put an end to the affair . Saturday was like a river of minutes ; he swallowed each drop deliberatelyas it went past him . He wandered through his house , through the streets , through his own mind . He could not achieve two consecutive thoughts . At five , when he was pacing in the two-foot stream of space between the desk and the bookshelves on one side of his room , the cot and bureau on the other , trying not to knock his knees on either bank , he heard voices in the hallway and rushed out to find Ignaz , Minna , Eli and Anna just back from a walk and bringing Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the day for the Viennese . Midday dinner is serious , eaten for the purpose of nourishment ; supper is light , the leftovers of the day 's food and happenings . Coffee is the truly social hour , lively , good-natured talk pouring out at the same flow and consistency as coffee from the pot 's spigot : the deep-burnt aroma , the relaxed stimulus of friends as Gemutlichkeit reigns : the feeling that each has a place in the world , no matter how simple ; that there are things to say and to hear , not important but never abrasive ; the comradery of being accepted , of laughing for laughter 's sake ; the confidence of there being one hour in the day that no man could confiscate and no man corrupt . Alexander told the story of the Nestroy play he had seen at the Volkstheatera short time before . Anna reached for the Sacher Torte so rarely purchased by the Freuds these days and handed out the thin slices of chocolate cake in stiff layers covered with raspberry jam and then a darkPOOLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A gleaming white mound of Schlagobers passed from hand to hand , the thick whipped cream to be piled on the cake . The Sacher Torte was at the very heart of the Viennese civilization . Covertly , Sigmund stole glances at Martha at the other end of the table . He realized that he had been sitting in his chair like a dummy for a considerable time now , and would soon be conspicuous by his silence . " I am reminded of the argument between Sachers and Demels about who invented the original Sacher Torte , " he said loudly enough to captureeveryone 's attention . " Matters got so acrimonious it was decided to submit the dispute to Emperor Franz Josef . One Sunday all of Vienna jammed into the gardens behind Schonbrunn while inside the royal palacethe Emperor and his Cabinet sampled first the one Torte , then the other . At the end of the day they appeared on the balcony .

He rose and made his way down the hall to the parlor . The draperies had been opened but the room was cool , shaded from the sun of the Kaiser Josefs-Strasse by Amalie 's white lace curtains .

" Martha , did you receive my letter ? " " Yes , Sigi , but not until this morning . " It was the first time she had used the diminutive of his name . A tremor ran through him . He was angry with himself at his shyness and lack of courage . But had he not declared himself in his letter ? It was up to Marthanow .

" He took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . came up against something hard . Blinking , he stretched the branch out in front of him . There was a golden glint among the white blossoms .

" He slipped the ring onto his little finger , the only one it would fit , put the lime blossoms down and took Martha in his arms . " What a wonderful way to answer my letter ! Oh , Martha , I love you so dearly . " 48 POOLS ' TOWER " I love you too , Sigi . " He held her so resolutely that it was obvious he could never let her go .

They sat on the sofa , holding each other . He had never been so happy . When at length he could bear to take his lips from hers , he said : " I have no gift for you , Martha .

" " Our early ancestors decreed seven years . " " I 'll wait . " She walked to the coffee table and picked up a small package she had placed there , brought out a teakwood box . " Do you remember what you said at dinner when you took my place card ? About the primitive belief in possession ? I 've brought you a better token . " It was a photograph , taken a short time before . He held it straight out ahead of him at arm 's length .

" But altogether , " he decided , " the loveliest lady I 've gazed upon . " He had difficulty turning away from the reproduction and returning to the original . Martha had been watching his face , bemused by the emotionthat swept unguardedly across it . " Sigi , when Eve tempted Adam , do you suppose she stopped to peel the apple ? " " I doubt it . They were in too much of a hurry to get out of the Garden of Eden and into the sinful world . " " Is it sinful ? " " I 'm almost as innocent about that as you are . I locked myself in a laboratoryuntil I experienced Martha 's magic . " " You do believe in magic ? " she asked . " In love ? Incontestably .

I am the complex and confused character in this relationship . My friends have always called me a cynic . As a trained scientist I never thought of myself as a sentimentalist .

" BOOK TWOTHE LONGING SOULBOOK TWOThe Longing SoulTAE ALLGEMEINE KRAN%ENHAUS , where Sigmund Freud would spend the next three to four years , had been slow in growing . A Poorhouse had first been built on the site in 1693 , a hundred and ninety years before , its First Court being called Der Grosse Hof . By 1726 a building was completed around the Second and adjoining Court , The Marriage and Widows ' Court . During the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied : the Sick Courtyard , the Housekeeping Courtyard , the Artisans ' Courtyard , the Students ' Courtyard . . . . Then Emperor Josef II , an idealist and visionary , traveled through Europe incognito and , in 1783 , decreed that the Grossarmenhaus , Large Poorhouse , be converted into a Main Hospital , and patterned on the HBtel de Dieu in Paris . It was to incorporate all the latest conveniences and discoveries . The courtyards were rebuilt and modernized , sewers and cesspools installed , chimneys moved from the center of the room , kitchens installed , windows enlarged , the space allocated to each bed increased to five feet . All refuse from the hospital was to be burned on a special lot across the street from the hospital ; it was forbidden to throw dead animals into the Alser Creek which ran close by . Nurses would serve quarantined cases food and supplies through the windows only . The University of Vienna Medical School was moved in and the Allgemeine Krankenhaus began its spectacular rise to eminence among the world 's great hospitals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the Austro-Hungarian Empire , while the hospitaldeveloped an awesome reputation for the brilliant research coming out of its laboratories . The General Hospital became a community unto itself . A dozen large quadrangular buildings housed its twenty departments and fourteen institutesand clinics , each enclosing a large , beautifully landscaped court connected by means of long tunnel-arches the width of the building above , the entire two hundred and fifty acres securely enclosed against the outside world by stone walls . The water was brought in from Semmering , high on the mountains , in special pipes ; there was running water on each54 THE LONGING SOULfloor ; the food although contracted to outsiders was cooked in the hospital'skitchens . There was a reading room for the doctors , and a lending library for the twenty-five thousand patients who occupied the two thousandbeds over the course of a year . The courts were lighted by gas lamps , new inventions such as electricity and the telephone being used only experimentally . Fiillofen , coke stoves , heated the wards in winter ; in summerthe upper part of the windows could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Catholic chapel and , in the Sixth Court , an octagonally shaped synagogue for the Jewish patients and doctors . There was a bathhousein the Fourth Court with private rooms for tub and steam baths . All wards had adjoining tea kitchens and , at a distance safe enough to keep away odors , water closets with flush toilets . The unhygienic straw mattresses of earlier years had been replaced by three sections of horsehairwhich could be changed about to keep them flat and firm . The mortalityrate was low , only fourteen percent ; the fees ran from four gulden a day , a dollar and sixty cents , for first-class patients , to seven cents a day for indigent Viennese , to free medication for paupers . The well-populated maternity wards , which trained midwives as well as doctors , charged their patients thirty-six cents a day for room , board and delivery. 2 . An air of excitement hung over Dr. Theodor Billroth 's operating room on the second floor of the Surgery Clinic overlooking the First Court , with its tall Greek frieze separating the operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central office to register for the course and found the tiers of the amphitheater jammed . The surgeons of Vienna had turned out to watch Professor Billroth perform the second test of his newly discovered " resection . " It had long been known that a man could have an arm or leg cut off and still live ; war had proved that . But it had not been known that a part of a man 's viscera containing a tumor or obstructioncould be cut out and the severed ends of the intestines or stomachsewed together . Sigmund joined a group of some twenty doctors sitting on the window ledge and standing on the steps beyond the frieze . During his thirty hours of courses in clinical surgery under Billroth he had learned a good deal about pathology but little about surgery . Part of the fault had been his : he had never intended to operate on patients . Part had been Billroth 's , who announced : " To give special courses in operating for students is futile . The typical operations are discussed and demonstrated to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clinic . " THE LONGING SOUL 55Billroth had been a brilliant lecturer , the halls had been crowded with admirers , yet Sigmund had never been given the opportunity to meet the Herr Professor , or to exchange the simplest greeting with him . Now that he was preparing for general practice it was imperative that he learn how to perform surgery . In an emergency a patient 's life might depend on his skill with a knife or scalpel . There was no help for it if he was going to become a good doctor , and he had no intention of becoming a bad or mediocre one . Professor Theodor Billroth had helped to transform surgery from a crude handicraft practiced by the town 's barbers into a precise and documentedart . He was also the first with the courage to publish reports on his operations ; since surgeons lost more cases than they saved , the reports were macabre reading . But Billroth insisted , " Failures must be acknowledged , at once and publicly , without glossing over our mistakes . An unsuccessfulcase is more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book he had published six years earlier , in 1876 , was a slashing attack on the medieval methods still used in medical schools , with a plan for reorganization . A gratuitous five pages of it had constituted a disastrousblow to the hard-won harmony enjoyed at the Medical School . Underthe heading " Student Types , The Jews at Vienna , " Billroth had written : It has been rightly said that at Vienna there are more poor students than anywhere else , and that they ought to be assisted because living at Vienna is so expensive . Yes , if the question were one of poverty alone ! . . . Young men , mostly Jews , come to Vienna from Galicia and Hungary , who have absolutely nothing , and who have conceived the insane idea that they can earn money in Vienna by teaching , through small jobs at the stock exchange , by peddling matches , or by taking employment as post office or telegraph clerks . . . and at the same time study medicine . . . . A Jewish merchant in Galicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and his family from starving , has a very moderately gifted son . The vanity of the mother demands a scholar , a Talmudist , in the family . In the face of countless difficulties he is sent to school and passes his final examinationwith great effort . Then he comes to Vienna with his clothes and nothing else . . . . Such people are in no way fitted for a scientific career . . . . It was this pronouncement that Professor Brilcke had been so sensitive about . Up to this time whatever latent anti-Semitism may have existed had been kept underground . Jew and Gentile had mixed freely on all56 THE LONGING SOULintellectual , artistic and scientific levels , if not social ones . Billroth 's publicattack , the first to come from an official source since Emperor Leopold I forced the Jews out of the Old City in 1669-7o and across the Donau Kanal to settle in what had become the Second District , had once again made prejudice respectable . Theodor Billroth had wanted to become a musician but his parents had persuaded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahms ; many of Brahms 's scores were first played by Brahms himself in Billroth 's home . In his love for music Billroth was very much like Professor Briicke : half scientist , half artist . Now his seven Assistants and Professors Extraordinarius were standing in a circle about the patient awaiting the arrival of their chief . The windowswere closed against the stifling August heat , there was an air of reverentialquiet , with all eyes fastened on the door . Sigmund had grown inured to the hospital odors during his student days . In strode Dr. Billroth , a handsome man of fifty-three with a short graywhitebeard and rimless spectacles low on his nose . His Assistants stood at attention , the students and visiting surgeons simply stood . Billroth , who was called upon to operate on emperors , kings and potentates from Turkey , Russia and the Orient , was expensively clothed . Sigmund had heard that he earned a hundred thousand dollars a year . The hospital , the surgicalrooms and equipment , his Assistants and young professors were all at his disposal without cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Assistants at the Krankenhaus earned thirty-six dollars a month , the Extraordinarii , a hundred and sixty , despite the fact that several of the latter were already middle-aged men with families to support . Nor were they permitted to practice privately without Billroth 's consent . He allowed each of them an occasional private operation for a fee , enough , Sigmund judged , to keep them from desperation . Dr. Billroth pushed back the sleeves of his English wool suit . He did not allow white aprons in his operating room because he felt they would make the surgeons look like barbers . No one wore gloves . Nurses were not permitted in the room . He nodded to the head of his staff , Dr. Anton Wolfler , who raised the report he had been holding and read aloud in a flat voice : " The patient is Josef Mirbeth . Age forty-three . Appears to have drunk some nitric acid from a vodka glass , mistaking it for lemonade . Symptoms : can only drink liquids . Vomits everything he swallows . Strong pressure on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stomach . " One of the Assistants covered the patient 's face with six layers of gauze . Chloroform was dropped onto the gauze . Billroth made his incision neatly parallel to the ribs , a cut twelve inches long and two centimeters underTilt LONGING SOUL 57the navel . He cut the blood vessels between the stomach and the large intestine . This freed the stomach , making it mobile . The Assistants put clamps on the blood vessels and metal retractors to hold the wound open . Others sponged up the blood , though Sigmund was surprised to see how little there was . Billroth made detailed observations as he moved along which an Assistant wrote into the patient 's record book , beneath a precise drawing of the incision . By putting his hand under the floating stomach and duodenum Billroth was able to cut into them easily with his scalpel . He saw at once a white , fanlike spreading cord on the outside of the pylorus . He stopped abruptly , lifted his head and said to the room : " We were in error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the acid scars . The duodenum has been thickened to such an extent that only a pin could be put through . We will have to excise ten centimeters of duodenumand stomach . " While an Assistant continued to sift drops of chloroform onto the gauze , Billroth proceeded to cut out the obstruction . Because the duodenal openingwas only half as wide as the stomach opening , he first sewed up half of the stomach with sutures before he matched the two openings for size . He then sewed them together , making sure the connection was totally sealed , that there could be no leakage of food or liquid . This done , he closed the incision with silk ligatures . The operation was completed . It had taken an hour and a quarter . The sections that had been cut out were put in a jar for the pathology laboratory . Billroth washed his hands in a solution of bichloride . His youngestAssistant handed him a towel . He dried his hands , rolled down the unsoiled sleeves of his street coat , bowed formally to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a buzz of admiring talk among the doctors and students who filed out , leaving only Billroth 's staff and a group of some ten surgery students , including Sigmund , standing in a tight circle around the operatingtable . Billroth 's Chief Assistant , Wolfler , prepared to operate on the next patient , who had abscesses on his head , pain in one hip and the inability to move one of his legs . Dr. Wolfler said , " I do n't know whether there is any connection between the head abscesses and the immobile leg . We 'll puncture this bad kneecap and draw off the pus . " They drew off the yellow fluid , then cauterized the wound and bandagedthe knee . Sigmund walked home to the Kaiser Josefs-Strasse for middaydinner , regretting that he would see nothing more of Billroth 's wizardry for a couple of months , as the professor was leaving for a vacationin Italy to join his friend Brahms. 58 THE LONGING SOULAs an Aspirant in surgery , Dr. Sigmund Freud would work in the wards from eight to ten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read from ten until midnight . The bedside reports of the patients had to be kept up meticulously . In the hours between his ward duties he had to read the literature on surgery , the articles being printed in the medical journals , and attend all operations . The operating room would become his headquarters : a big , pleasant whitewashed room flooded with summer sun from the high window overlooking the First Court , where the convalescentsin their blue-striped nightgowns could wander in the shade of the linden trees . Returning to the ward for his afternoon service , he found that Billroth 's patient , Josef Mirbeth , was feeling nauseous but insisted that the pain in his stomach was gone . Sigmund was amazed at the speed of the recovery and the fact that there was little fever . The next patient was fifty-year-old Maria Gehring , who underwent a breast operation for cystosarcoma ; then seven-year-old Lenasse Anton , whose leg had become foreshortened from a previous operation and who now had to have it broken again and cleaned out ; next Jakob Kipflinger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between were the patients who were found to be inoperable and were sent home to await death . Sigmund was not allowed to handle a knife but he assisted with other chores : draining wounds , applying clamps , bandaging . With Billroth gone the staff relaxed , brought each Aspirant close to the patient to see how the surgical instruments were used . There was a good deal of comradery , particularly among the young unmarried men who established their own little Stammtisch at a nearby coffeehouse for late supper . The patients under Sigmund 's care did well . One by one they were sent home , all except Mirbeth , who began to develop complications four days after his operation . His recovery had been important to the entire department . Sigmund had given him special care , but on the sixth day Mirbeth became semi-conscious . He had been coughing for several days but this had not seemed serious . Now his fever was high and his pulse rapid . Sigmund checked his book ; every detail was faithfully recorded , including the fact that Mirbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . When midnight came , he could not tear himself away . Two of Billroth 's Assistants also stood by . They tried simple remedies , cold packs , but Mirbethwas sinking rapidly . He died at three in the morning . Sigmund felt a sense of personal loss . He was back before eight the next morning to speak with Dr. Wolfler , a man of thirty-two with a finely trimmed mustache and beard . He was a THE LONGING SOUL 59gifted surgeon , as Sigmund had cause to learn from watching him repair the harelip of an infant , remove a man 's cancerous eye from its socket , perform a gynecological operation that seemed to cut out half the woman 's abdomen . He asked : " Herr Dr. Wolfler , will there be an inquest on Josef Mirbeth ? " " None is indicated , Herr Kollege . The body will go over to Dissectionbut we are not asking for a report . " " Then how will we know whether he died of peritonitis , pneumonia , reblockage of the stomach . . . ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor here . It presents too many intangibles . But , as you saw , Herr Mirbeth would have been dead by now of starvation . Count it as a gain that the operation gave us further experience with working inside the stomach and duodenum . We will probablylose the first hundred cases . But by then the technique will be perfected and surgeons all over the world will be able to perform the operationsuccessfully . " Sigmund bowed his head slightly . " I wish to thank you , Herr Doktor , for your patience with me . " But as he moved down the ward , saw Mirbeth 's empty bed , he thought : " How is Billroth going to publish the results of this case without glossingover the failure , ' to use his own words , if we do n't try to find out what went wrong ? What have we left from Mirbeth to instruct with ? We have detailed diagrams of the operation and ward records ; but what actually caused his death ? " 3 . For a man who has never been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark side of the moon . He was distressed , having already gone through several bouts of possessiveness of which he would not have believed himself capable . The first incident had taken place two days before his visit to Modling . Calling at the Bernays home , he had found Martha working on a musical portfolio for Max Mayer , a fond and older cousin . As he watched her bending happily over the sheets he had been flooded with jealousy : " It 's too late . She loves Max . There is no chance for me . I 'm going to lose her . . . . " He had stopped dead in his tracks . " Whoa ! Whoa ! She is only preparing a scrapbook to take to Hamburg to a cousin . She does n't love anybody yet . It will be you ; but slowly , slowly . Do n't let her see you acting like a fool . " The second episode had broken into the open . The engagement of Martha and Sigmund , as far as their young friends were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a July sun . Fritz Wahle , a painter and long-time friend of Sigmund 's , had brought Martha several books on the history of art to read and discuss with him . Though Fritz was engaged to Martha 's cousin Elise , Sigmund became uneasy : " Fritz , artists and scientists are natural opponents . Your art somehow provides you with a key to open feminine hearts , while we stand helpless in front of the citadel . " He then avoided Fritz and stopped speaking to him . Ignaz Schonberg brought them together for a coffee at the Cafe Kurzweil . Wahle stirred his Grossen Braunen as though it were a thick beef and barley soup . At length he looked up , his underlip protruding . " Sig , if you do n't make Martha happy , I will shoot you and then my-self . " Embarrassed , Sigmund laughed , a few artificial notes , but enough to outrage Wahle . " You laugh , do you ? If I write to Martha and instruct her to drop you , she will do as I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer Martha 's teacher and you ca n't instruct her in anything . " " We 'll see about that ! Herr Ober , bring me paper and pen . " Fritz dashed off a note in white heat . Sigmund pulled the sheet from Fritz 's hand and saw that Fritz had been writing the same kind of passionatelines that he himself had been sending to Martha . Fritz was in love with Martha and not her cousin Elise ! He tore the letter to shreds . Fritz stormed out of the cafe . Sigmund slept little that night . Had Martha encouraged Fritz ? He wrote to her : " I am made of harder stuff than he is , and when we match each other he will find he is not my equal . " He was engaged to Elise , but " only in logic are contradictions unable to coexist ; in feelings they quite happily continue alongside each other . . . . Least of all must one deny the possibility of such contradictions in feeling with artists , people who have no occasion to submit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercising his own " strict control of reason , " he told her that she would have to break off her relationship with Fritz . Any other solution was unacceptableto him . Martha refused . She replied that her friendship with Fritz had been a good one and it would be cruel to destroy it . She had a right to innocent friendships , and she was writing to Fritz to assure him that nothing had changed . Sigmund had known that Martha Bemays was an independent spirit . She herself had warned him that sweet people can have a will of iron . He had welcomed the idea ; but now , seeing her will set in opposition to his own , he went through torments of self-doubt , rage . How could MarthaTHE LONGING SOUL 61really love him if she would not observe his wishes in so fundamental a matter ? He thrashed his way through the streets trying to wear down his emotionsagainst the cobblestones . The fierceness of the midsummer sun , even at this late afternoon hour , had turned the city into a caldron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returning home , he poured out a letter of stormy protest , sparing himself and his fiancee nothing of the tempest racking his inexperienced heart . Should he hide his feelings from Martha ? But how could they achieve a permanent relationshipthat way ? They had agreed to be totally honest with each other and to reveal as friends , rather than sweethearts , everything they were thinking and feeling . To himself Sigmund observed : " I am the one who insisted on this . I can live no other way . But when I made the stipulation did I have any idea of the agonies involved ? " To Martha he confessed unashamedly , " I lose all control of myself . ... Had I the power to destroy the whole world , ourselves included , to let it start all over again  --  even at the risk that it might not create Martha and myself  --  I would do so without hesitation . " What unsettled him was that it took four days for letters to be exchanged . By the time he had gotten over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He forgave himself for these transgressionsonly because he acknowledged to himself though not yet to Martha that he and his sister Rosa had " a nicely developed tendency towardneurasthenia . " He returned to surgery to watch the daily succession of ailing , crushed , deformed bodies brought to the operating table . Some cases were simple , such as reshaping eighteen-year-old Johann Smejkal 's legs in plaster-ofPariscasts . Others were long and intricate , taking four or five hours : the excision of Rupert Hipfel 's abscesses in the anal area ; removing WalburgaGorig 's goiter , taking a section out of Johann Denk 's jaw . Sigmund cared for the several wards of patients during his two shifts of duty . " Though in truth , " he mused , his eyes dark with concern , " there is little I am called upon to do : keep the wounds dry , watch for fever , order changes in bandages or drugs , write down the developments in the record books . " Resourceful surgeons were instructing him , but the closer he watched the more he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery . It might be a full two years , including the performing of these operations on the cadavers stretched out in the dissection laboratory , before he would even be permitted to operate on patients . In all truth would he not be better advised , once he was out in general practice , to rush any patient in need to a qualified surgeon ? It was the conviction he had arrived at six years before. 62 THE LONGING SOULThere was no prescribed course for the Aspirant , unpaid candidate for a post , at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus . The young doctor could apply to any department in which he wished training , and remain as long or short a time as he thought he needed . No one told him which discipline to move into next . It was expected , in a general sort of way , that he would take training in every department so that he would be equipped to do everythingfrom delivering a baby to wiping out a plague . But nobody checked or cared . The doctor was his own man . He decided to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admissionof defeat as well as an affront to Professor Billroth and his staff . Having made the decision , he did not feel badly about it , any more than he had when he found during his undergraduate years that he had no gift for chemistry . A man had to face his limitations and move on to fields in which he could be master of his materials . Nevertheless he was confused . He became depressed , wrote to Martha how black the future looked , with formless years of work , much of it useless to him , stretching bleakly ahead without her . It seemed impossible to go anywhere in this frozen structure where one man alone could rise to the head of a clinic , institute or department and the others were doomed to remain obsequious workhorses . The only way to break out of this academic and administrative prison was to abandon it to others and start afresh somewhere else . He wondered if Martha would consent to move to England with him when they were married . English medicine , the hospitals and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his half brothers to be less stratified ; " ossified " was the word he had used at the time . He had been impressed by the way Philipp and Emanuel lived : as English gentlemen , in big comfortable Tudor-style homes , having acquired the manners and hospitality of the English gentleman . He wondered why he could not become an English gentleman , wearing well-cut suits instead of this shapeless gray jacket and these wrinkled breeches . Young doctors and scientists were welcomed by the British medical profession providing they were well trained ; and England , like Europe , stood in awe of the accomplishments of the Vienna Medical School . " We could be independent . England knows about independence . It practically created it for individual man ; or at least re-created it from the Greeks . " Martha was growing used to his moodiness , the soaring flights of hope in one letter , the dejection in the next . She answered with consolation and affection , managing to keep herself on an even keel despite the half dozen pages of tumultuous handwriting which arrived nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had long ago exhausted the supply of envelopes she had addressed . Toward the end of August he developed a sore throat . When he could barely speak or swallow food he asked a Billroth Assistant to look at it . " But of course you have pain . It comes from a case of Ludwig 's angina . The infection is beginning to form an abscess near your tonsils . Better let me lance it before it spreads to the floor of your mouth . " He accompanied his friend into the surgical room where a knife was cauterized , then stuck with a deft movement into his throat . The pain was so intense that , unable to cry out , he banged his hand hard on the wooden table at which he was sitting . The pearl broke loose from Martha'sring and went skittering to an opposite corner , under a cabinet . More stricken than by the surgeon 's knife , he jumped up , sank to his knees before the cabinet and fished out the pearl . The surgeon said : " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigmund grinned woefully , spat up the infectious material , clutched the pearl in his left hand . He made his way home and went to bed with fever and general misery . He was up in a few days but found himself preoccupied . Something was still sticking in his throat . It was the pearl . He wrote to Martha , " Answerme on your honor and conscience whether at eleven o'clock last Thursday you happened to be less fond of me , or more than usually annoyed with me , or perhaps even untrue ' to me , as the song has it . Why this tasteless ceremonious conjuration ? Because I have a good opportunity to put an end to a superstition . " It was also an opportunity to tell her how he felt about her absence. " . . . a frightful yearning , frightful is hardly the right word , better would be uncanny , monstrous , ghastly , gigantic ; in short , an indescribablelonging for you . " 4 . Martha returned early in September , after nearly three months . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . What had seemed to be a pure love idyll at the time of their engagement had begun to show fissures . He was the first to concede that the leverage needed to pry them apart had been provided by him . When he had spent the last of his gulden to send her a gift she took him to task in her return letter , telling him that he must not be extravagant . He wrote back like an outraged husband : " Martha must give up saying so categorically , You must n't do that ! " 64 THE LONGING SOULand then went on to inform her , with all the possessiveness of his nature , that she was no longer a daughter or older sister but rather a young sweetheart . " When you do return you are coming back to me , you understand , no matter how your filial feelings may rebel against it . . . . For has it not been laid down since time immemorial that the woman shall leave father and mother and follow the man she has chosen ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . no one else 's love compares with mine . " He had tipped his hand now : he was going to be the master and she was to become a docile Haus f rau . But he had not yet taken a proper gauge on his sweetheart . She wrote a tart reply which he had the good grace to acknowledge he had earned . That the tiffs had not hurt their love he learned the afternoon after her return when they walked hand in hand to see the developments in the magnificently burgeoning Ringstrasse . Chaperoned by Eli , Minna and Ignaz , they made their way along the Verbindungs Eisenbahn , entered the Stadtpark with its high elms and ash trees , then followed a path runningthrough thick shrubbery and found an open green area where the Viennese drank coffee and listened to the band on Sundays . They came out on the Parkring . What was now the Ringstrasse had for hundreds of years been the high fortification walls enclosing the Central City with its surrounding moats and , beyond , the broad glacis or drill grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place Vienna was imprisoned ; the Innere Stadt remained a medieval walled city . These walls were important , the Austrian army said , to protect the prosperous , upper classes within the city from the working people who lived in the suburbs . Emperor Franz Josef rejected the reasoning . In December of 1857 he ordered the abolishment of " the circumvallation and fortifications of the Inner City as well as the surrounding ditches . " The process was a long one , taking some five years to tear down the walls , fill the ditches , integratethe glacis . But the polygon Ringstrasse that emerged in its place by 1865 , with its horseshoe opening facing the Donau Kanal lined with palatial apartment houses ; its splendiferous Opera ; broad , tree-lined boulevardwith its white Acropolis-like Parliament , neo-Gothic City Hall , new University and open gardens with lime trees fragrant in June and roses blooming through late summer and fall , made Vienna one of the most modern and beautiful of cities . T'o the Viennese the Ringstrasse was as magnificent as the Champs Elysees in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would always rule an important portion of the Western world . Twilight had settled in . The Laternenanzunder were lighting the highTHE LONGING SOUL 65gas lamps with long extendible poles , first opening the glass door with a hook , then turning on the gas jet , next applying a flame from the hissing end of the pole before adjusting the burner , closing the glass door and moving on to the next lamp . " Do you know , Sigi , " Martha exclaimed , " after spending a couple of months in my own city , I found that I missed Vienna . " " Could I be part of the reason ? " He kissed her affectionately . " I have the feeling that I am going to mix a few metaphors but it is true that a relationship is the more seaworthy if it has weathered a few storms . All hands now know that the ship is n't going to founder in the first squall . " Martha lodged herself firmly against a chestnut tree . " I get seasick in rough weather . Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wasteful to fight the people one loves . Why do n't you stay on the bridge and navigate this ship you have introduced , and let me be the engineer ? Both officers are equal on board but they have separatepowers . " He was amused by her adroitness , but sombered . " I do n't even know which harbor I 'm looking for . " She nestled her shoulder against his . " Why have you been so dissatisfied with your efforts this summer ? " " Because I do n't think I 've progressed enough to justify the expenditure of two months ' time , vis-a-vis our marriage , I mean . " " Then you 're letting the idea of our marriage become a burden to you . You should think only of completing your studies . " " Probably what I 'm upset about is which department I should go into next . Dermatology is important for general practice but not a very appetizingfield . The course I enjoyed most was under Professor Meynert in clinical psychiatry , brain anatomy . Meynert favored my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veneration for him . He says I can start my training with him right now . At the same time there is a rumor that ProfessorHermann Nothnagel is being invited to come from the University of Jena to take over our Clinic of Internal Medicine . If that is true , he will need Assistants .... " Eli signaled them to turn back . Martha murmured , " I told Mother I was bringing you home to supper . " " Does she know ? " " She suspects . " " How is she reacting ? " " She says , Why do all three of my children choose penniless partners ? What is the virtue in being poor ? " 66 THE LONGING SOULWhen Sigmund heard that Nothnagel had been officially invited to come to Vienna he sent a message to the Breuers asking if he might join them for the Jause and bring Martha with him . They decided to tell Mrs. Bernays where they were going , since they would need no chaperon . Martha wore a blue silk dress with crocheted collar and cuffs . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model for his own . She also felt that she would be on trial . Mathilde Breuer had no such idea . She ushered Martha and Sigmund into the dining room where the table had been covered with a fresh white cloth . On it she set the platters of Guglhup f , chocolate cakes and , as Josef came down from his laboratory , the platter of linked pairs of sausages . " A pair " was immutable and sacred in Viennese custom ; it was as unthinkable to serve one sausage or three as it would be for one person alone or three together to attempt marriage . As Mathilde put a roll on each plate she cut the link binding the pair ; the snipping indicated that the afternoon repast could begin . Mathilde was in fine fettle . The month in Venice had healed all the wounds . Martha barely touched her food . She sat quietly listening to the spirited byplay of the three old friends . Mathilde knew how difficult it must be for a newcomer , particularly a young girl , to break into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . When Sigmund told Josef of Nothnagel 's appointment and of his hopes for an assistantship , Josef cocked his head to one side with a bemused smile . " For a young man who has reconciled himself to the rigors of private practice , I must say you are decamping mighty fast . " " Only at the first opportunity ! " They all laughed , the tension snapped . Then Josef said , " But you 're right to move in this direction . Let 's see , Nothnagel 's two most famous books , besides his original Handbook of Pharmacology , are Topical Diagnosis of the Illnesses of the Brain and Experimental Investigations of the Functions of the Brain . The man he 'll admire most in Vienna is Theodor Meynert . You must secure a card of recommendation from Meynert at once . " Professor Hermann Nothnagel had barely moved into his apartment when Sigmund arrived , carrying a card from Professor Theodor Meynert recommending him for his " valuable histological work " and expressing gratitude if Professor Nothnagel would give Dr. Freud a hearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting room in which the maid asked him to wait was handsomely furnished in the best Thuringian style . Professor Nothnagel , like Professor Billroth , was fortunate : as directorTHE LONGING SOUL 67of a university medical clinic instead of an institute such as Professor Brucke 's , he could practice private medicine at the same time . It was said that he rarely returned home without finding ten patients at ten gulden a head waiting for him . On the walls were pictures of Nothnagel 's four children and on an easel stood a portrait of Frau Professor Nothnagel , who had died two years before . Under it was a vase of fresh flowers . After his wife 's death ProfessorNothnagel had said : " When one 's love is lost nothing remains but work . " Having been trained in the poetry of Schiller to adore and worship women , he felt that they should be protected from the world , kept delicate and sensitive . He was an adamant opponent of any woman being allowed to study medicine at the universities where he taught . Hermann Nothnagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a good man can be a good physician . " On the bookshelves Sigmund was now scanning there were the German classics , Greek and Latin plays , English novels and an extraordinary set of Bibles in Aramaic and Greek . Evidently Nothnagel 's interest in literature was as great as Professor Briicke 's devotionto painting , Billroth 's fascination with music . Sigmund wondered : " Do these men have a deep involvement in the arts because they have universal minds ? Or has the same faculty which empowers them with the imagination and bold flights of intellect to make startling discoveries in the sciences also enable them to grasp an art ? " A door opened at the far end of the room . Professor Nothnagel entered , dressed in a heavy black suit with a silk vest , silver buttons and a black silk tie covering much of his shirt front . His head and face were covered with a sandy blond hair , the same shade as his skin . His eyes were quiet . There were two large warts , one high on his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet for all its plainness it was a good face , the kind men liked in their associates . " Professor Nothnagel , I have been asked to bring you greetings from Professor Meynert . With your permission I should like to hand you this card . " Nothnagel motioned Sigmund to a leather bench . " I set great store by a recommendation from my colleague , Meynert . What can I do for you , Herr Doktor ? " " It is known that you are about to engage an Assistant , Herr Professor . I understand that you value scientific research . I myself have done some scientific research but at the moment I have no opportunity to continue . For this reason I am presenting myself to you as an applicant . " " Have you some reprints of your papers with you , Herr Dr. Freud ? " Sigmund took the monographs out of his coat pocket . Nothnagel readthe titles and first paragraph of each . Sigmund continued , " At first I stud-68 THE LONGING SOULied zoology , then I changed to physiology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in histology . When Professor Brucke told me there was no assistantship open and advised me , a poor man , not to stay with him , I left . " Nothnagel turned his dark eyes upon his young visitor . " I wo n't conceal from you that several people have applied for this job . As a result I ca n't raise any hopes . I will put your name down in case another job turns up . Qui vivra verra . I will hold onto your publications , if I may . " Sigmund swallowed hard . " I am now serving as an Aspirant in the General Hospital . If you ca n't offer me the prospect of an Assistant 's job , I would serve with you as an Aspirant . " " What exactly is an Aspirant ? " Sigmund explained that in the Allgemeine Krankenhaus structure an Aspirant was a young man who already had his M.D. and aspired to complete his technical training . When Nothnagel asked further questions Sigmundattempted to outline briefly the organization of the sixteen clinics and ten institutes as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and research ; the Medical Faculty composed of the professors , all paid by the Imperial Government and the Ministry of Education . The twenty departments were " the hospital " ; each had at its head a Primarius who could not be connected with a clinic and was under the jurisdiction and budget of the District of Lower Austria . A career under the control of the Imperial Government was separate and distinct from one in the departments . There was no crossing back and forth . Dr. Nothnagel raised his eyebrows in astonishment . Sigmund smiled . " The Allgemeine Krankenhaus has grown by accretion over a period of a century . It follows no logical plan except that of trying to keep the professorshappy , each in his special domain . " " How very odd all this is . Dr. Freud , I advise you to go on working in the scientific field . But first you 've got to live . Well , I 'll keep you in mind . Qui vivra verra . " " Who lives will see , ' as Herr Professor Nothnagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he closed the door behind him . " I intend to do both . But surely a slightly improved view of the future could n't do me any irreparableharm ? " THE LONGING SOUL 695 . The internal medicine wards were on the second floor overlooking another of the nine hospital courts . Each held twenty beds , ten to a side , in large pleasant rooms with whitewashed walls and high windows , three on each side and up to the ceiling , allowing all the light and sun that were available in Vienna . Sigmund arrived before eight on the first morning of Nothnagel 's clinicaldemonstration to his Aspirants and undergraduates . He was no strangerto these wards , having taken thirty hours of courses under Professor Bamberger . He made his way up the winding staircase , so narrow that the attendants carrying the emergency cases had to bend the stretcher and patient around the curves . Next to Nothnagel 's office were several small rooms for first-class paying patients whom Nothnagel could bring here at his discretion . The rooms would also be available to Nothnagel 's Assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fees which the Assistants could charge were prescribed . Professor Nothnagel was already in his office , surrounded by his newly chosen staff . " Grass Gott , Professor Nothnagel . " " Grass Gott , Herr Doktor Freud . " Sigmund looked with envy at the **25;13450;TOOLONG Assistants , several of whom he had known from his work in the laboratories . When Professor Nothnagel rose to make his way to the first ward , his entourage followed . There was a rigid caste system . As the professor stood at the bed of the patient to be diagnosed , only two of the older doctors or visiting colleagues could be at his side . In the second row would come his Assistants , in the third row the Aspirants and then , grouped as far back as necessary , the dozen or so students from the Medical School , the last of whom could see little of the patient . Two nurses were at work in the ward . They were broad-bosomed countrywomen who arrived in Vienna , generally at the age of fifteen , knowing only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bestscrubbedhospitals in the world . Many of them had come to Vienna seekingnot only work but husbands . Few found them . The girls put in years of training , mostly in menial tasks , before they were permitted to handle patients . They piled their hair on top of their heads , wore short-sleeved plaid blouses , skirts down to the middle of their shoes , and white aprons , narrow over the bosom and wrapped around at the waist . They were allowedout only twice a month on a Sunday afternoon . It was a hard life. 70 THE LONGING SOULProfessor Nothnagel took one look at the nurses ' short-sleeved blouses and banished them from the wards . " No woman will be allowed to show any flesh in my department , " he cried . " You will return with sleeves that come down to your hands ! " Sigmund was dumfounded at the outburst . Nothnagel turned to the assemblage , said in a low , stern voice : " Let me make something clear to all of you . When examining patients , either male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied may be exposed . " He approached the woman in the first bed . She was eighteen . There was a greenish tinge to her complexion . Her chart declared the case to be one of chlorosis and anemia . She had been a finicky eater , having " a depraved appetite . " She craved clay , slate and other indigestible articles . This condition had been thought to be mental ; Nothnagel assured the group that it was dietary . He turned from the bedside toward his followers . This was a different Nothnagel . There was a glow on his face and his eyes were warm and sparkling , the dedicated teacher . " My first warning is that you must exercise extreme care in making your diagnoses . It is no longer sufficient to examine only the organ the patient complains about . A conscientious physician examines the patient from head to toe , and only after a thorough observation does he unite the various elements into a unified diagnosis . Always remember that a human body is a complex living organism , every last element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the head can be caused by something that has gone wrong at the base of the spine . The only unforgivablesin in internal medicine is a lack of that sense of duty which demandsthat the patient have every conceivable attention and all of your powers of observation . " Turning back to the patient , " We believe that chlorosis may be connected with the evolution of the sexual system , but we are not certain just how . She must be given malt liquor , muscular exercise ... " Sigmund reflected on Nothnagel 's declaration . This was the approach known as " Nothnagel 's revolution " ; it was the first time he had heard these principles enunciated for internal medicine . When they moved on to the next bed they found a middle-aged woman with typhoid fever . It was she who was responsible for the sickening odor of feces in the ward , for she had been defecating in her bed . Sigmund recalled the saying , " Every case of typhoid represents a short circuit from one person 's anus to another person 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever of I04 degrees , with a slow pulse . She had pink spots over her trunk . He cautiously exposed a few of these spots . " There would seem to be intestinal bleeding . This can lead to deathTHE LONGING SOUL 71through ulceration . The patient can also die from pneumonia or peritonitis ; but we can bring her fever down with cold cloths , a good deal of liquid to drink , plenty of rest . This disease is caused by a parasite , but we do n't know which one . " The next bed held a thirty-four-year-old woman with chronic nephritis , Bright 's disease . He analyzed the symptoms . " The treatment for Bright 's disease , gentlemen : limit the salt in her diet , give her no meat but make sure she gets small doses of bichloride of mercury . We will hope that this will improve her kidney condition . She should never be allowed to becomepregnant again . Her condition can go on anywhere from a month to ten years . " They moved to the next bed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothnagel how hot it was in the ward . Nothnagelreplied , " The temperature is low . " The patient kicked off her covers , exposing herself . Nothnagel set his lips in a quick gesture and replaced them . He asked her to stick out her tongue , pointed out that it had a " fine tremor . " He then took a measurement on the goiter , declared it not a large one : " This kind of toxic goiter is rarely fatal but it debilitates the heart . Her heart is already overloaded by going Ito to 140 a minute . This is almost double the normal . We do n't know yet why goiter has this effect on the heart . We must take away from her all coffee , tea and mental excitement . Give her tincture of aconite ; it is a poison but not dangerous in small doses . We can only hope that the disease will subside before her heart breaks down . " " And how does one keep the doctor 's heart from breaking down ? " Sigmundasked himself quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnoses . Neither could there be any questionthat , although the specialist in internal medicine could make an accurate diagnosis of the symptoms , there was no corresponding body of knowledge of the cure . As if he had heard Sigmund 's thoughts , Nothnagel stopped in front of the bed of a thirty-four-year-old woman who was suffering from thrombosisand embolism . " The greatest medicine is nature . Nature has all the secrets of its own cures . Our task , colleagues , is to ferret out these secrets . Once we ferret out the secrets we can implement her work . But if we go against nature 's laws , we can only injure the patient . For example , the operation that I have heard was performed here recently , when a surgeon removed part of the stomach and duodenum . I believe this to be against nature . We must cure without cutting into the body of the patient . " 72 THE LONGING SOULSigmund Freud soon found out what Nothnagel meant when he said , " When a man 's love is lost , nothing remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing but work whether a man had love or not . " Whoever needs more than five hours of sleep should not study medicine , " he announced . Each morning Sigmund followed Nothnagel through the wards for from two to four hours , learning something every hour in the art of diagnosis from the " bedside demonstrations . " Nothnagelexpressed his delight at the " richness of the source material " : the twenty-four-year-old male with a rheumatic heart ; the man of sixty-two dying from dehydration caused by cancer of the stomach ; the sailor who had returned with malaria from an African port ; a case of an old gonorrhealstricture which had developed multiple opening fistulas between the anus and genitalia , and a " watering pot " perineum because the urine flowed out through his skin ; the diabetic ; the aphasia case , with the man losing all ability to talk ; the unending stream of new patients , all minutely examined and diagnosed before Sigmund 's eyes , of pellagra and scurvy ; pleurisy , anemias , gout , leukemia , hepatitis , angina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills the flesh is heir to , and nearly every sickness that would present itself in Dr. Sigmund Freud 's consultation room . He was fascinated by the poetic imagery and breadth of vocabulary which Nothnagel had taken from the world 's literature and brought to bear on such subjects as gallstones or valvular lesions . Nothnagel spent his free hours in his laboratory where he was continuinghis work on the physiology and pathology of the intestinal canal , using live animals for his experimentation . As an Aspirant , Sigmund was not permitted to carry on research . However he faithfully attended the demonstrations , read himself blear-eyed until one or two in the morning . The months passed . No appointment as an Assistant was indicated . By late October another fact became clear : he had no intuitive resources for diagnosis of the kind demonstrated by Professor Nothnagel . Nor would he be able to " divine " the nature and causes of illness . He would be able to recognize symptoms based on his training but internal medicinecould never be the focus of his life . Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , Sigi , if it is not to be your field ? We have seen each other only one evening a week . " He grinned sheepishly . " In medicine there is no way of knowing whether there is a career for you unless you accumulate training ; you ca n't learn that a book is useless until you 've read it . I am inching forward with the sideways movement of the crab . Without research possibilities , without publishing or lecturing ... " THE LONGING SOUL 73His voice trailed off . They had just crossed the Josefs-Platz with its large equestrian statue of Josef II and majestic Hof-Library . Sigmund had secured written permission , through the office of the Medical Faculty , to enter Die Burg . This Hofburg was a city within a city , the very heart of Imperial Vienna . Each succeeding emperor had added new stone wings , squares , facades , chapels , fountains . They came opposite the goldencrustedSwiss Gate , inside which they could see the first quadrangle built about x 220 and cornered with bristling defense towers . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of architecture and decoration , classical Greek , Gothic , Italian Renaissance , Baroque . . . The Burgkapelleof the mid-fifteenth century differing sharply in style from the Amalienhof of the sixteenth , which bore little relationship to Emperor Leopold I 's apartments of the seventeenth and even less to the Neue Burg which had been started by Emperor Franz Josef only two years before . Yet the palace had its historical continuity , and it was a poor day for a Viennese when he could not find an excuse to cut through the series of monumental squares from the business district of Michaelerplatz at one end to the stately Burgring with its long view of the gardens between the twin museums on the other . Resting on a bench in the Stadtpark for a moment , the pale April sunlightbrittle on their faces , Martha reverted to Sigmund 's serious comment before they had entered the palace grounds . . . that he was moving forward with the sideways movement of the crab . Sigmund waved an arm encompassing the overpowering Hofburg surrounding them . " Ah well , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried off by death without having his name carved on a rock . " She answered quietly , " Sig , the fact that you could evoke such an image proves it is in your mind . You deprecate yourself when all avenues of progress appear blocked . " 6 . The financial situation was growing increasingly difficult in the Freud household . Jakob was getting only an occasional bit of work in the textile district . Sigmund could not determine whether his father had more illness because he worked less , or he worked less because he was often irritable . The five Freud daughters , all now over eighteen , bright , educated , hearty girls , could not help because no one would employ females except as a bonne , nursemaid or companion to elderly women . Anna was planning to be married soon , but Brust had disappeared from Rosa 's life . The four unattached girls offered to take jobs and contribute to the finances but74 THE LONGING SOULJakob and Amalie were in agreement that such jobs were for lower-class girls from the workingmen 's district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud girls would seriously injure their marriage possibilities ; it would be an announcement to the world that the family was in extremis . Better to suffer the privation . The immediate ray of hope was Alexander . Though he had not been an enthusiastic student , caring little for theory or abstract thought , he passed his Matura . After the graduation exercises Alexander walked home with his older brother . " Sig , you know I 'm practical by nature . I like business . I 'm sure I 'll be good at it . I want to get a job right away where I can learn . I also want to start bringing wages into the house . " Graduation and maturity had arrived hand in hand . Alexander was still several inches shorter than Sigmund , clean-shaven , with his hair cut short ; otherwise they looked quite astonishingly alike , as though their parents had come back to an original formula after a lapse of ten years and five quite different-looking daughters . Alexander had been named by Sigmund , at Jakob 's invitation , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews . He was subject to ups and downs of emotion and labored under the illusion that this was not true of his older brother , whom he idolized , for Sigmund concealed his recurrent depressions from his family as a burden they should not have to share . Alexander had Sigmund'shigh forehead , wide-spaced eyes , attractively shaped nose and chin ; his expression was plain , forthright . However a basic difference in their temperaments had begun to emerge . Sigmund 's philosophy was , " Anything that can possibly go right will go right . " Alexander maintained , " Anything that can possibly go wrong will go wrong . " He had long been the one in the family who repaired whatever broke , from the rung of a chair that needed regluing to the stuffed-up water tank that had to be removed and cleaned out . " What kind of work would you like , Alex ? " " I love trains . Remember , Sig , when you used to take me to the Nordbahnhofto watch the trains come in ? Then we went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ready for long hauls across Europe . I would n't want to be an engineer . But I 'd like the business of keeping them loaded with freight and passengers . Do you know anyone who can get me any kind of job ? " Sigmund pondered on this . " After all these years in medicine , I do n't have any friends in business . The only approach we have is Eli . " Eli Bernays persuaded Professor von Stein to give Alex a job in the office where his economic research was carried on and his journal published . There was only one catch . Alex had to begin as an apprentice , THE LONGING SOUL 75without salary . " But as soon as I can prove to the professor that he is useful , " said Eli , " we can get him a wage . " Alexander groaned . " How long might that take , Eli ? " " Not too long . A few months . Trust me . " Alex went to work the following Monday , his black coat buttoned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tie showing , and in the center of the knot Alex 's one bit of finery : a large pearl stickpin . He was happy , excited , but not nervous . It was not the kind of job Alex could do well ; there was too much theory involved . When after three months Sigmund told Alex he should demand a salary , Alex , honest with himself , asked : " What do I do if they refuse ? I have n't really been able to make myselfuseful . " Eli could not get a salary for Alex . " Give me until the first of the year , " he demanded . Alexander located a small company that specialized in railroad transportation , freight rates , routes . It was owned by an elderly , childless man by the name of Moritz Muenz who had been looking for a bright young lad . Alex walked in with his shining face and love for railroads . Muenz offered a good wage for a sixteen-year-old , six gulden a week . Alexander , when he brought his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the proudest young man in Vienna . The snows began early in November , the first flakes , as Sigmund watched them from his window . small , hardly larger than raindrops , just a white tinge sifting down at an angle , thickening into a heavy white blanket as though pressure-driven from above , melting before they reached the pavement , leaving the ground as wet as though rain had fallen . He noted the small coveys of sparrows , never more than ten , wheeling in the cold gray skies as though they did not know which way was south . The next fall of snow was considerably heavier ; walking to the Allgemeine Krankenhaus , he saw the buildings as though through white satin . But the big flakes melted when they hit the remaining leaves of the trees or the slate roofs . The pillows and bedding that had been put on the window sills in the early mornings to air were gone now ; the people emerging from the houses wore heavy overcoats , put up their umbrellas , holding them tightly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first strong gust of wind . The walnut trees were the reluctant givers . They clung to their leaves and the leaves to their greenness through the snows and early cold ; but by the end of the second week in November the high winds tore them76 THE LONGING SOULloose and raced them at rooftop level through the streets like flocks of green birds . Sigmund knew the fierce , capricious winds of Vienna ; knew them too well from his long years of trudging to school . They had the sense of direction of a compass : at any given hour they blew only through the east and west streets . Another day it would be north and south . He would be walking in comparative warmth , take a right-angle turn and instantly be met by a blast of icy wind that almost blew him from the sidewalk . Like sailors , the Viennese wet a finger and put it into the wind to see if they could walk home in a direct line . Being with Martha was his only delight during these hard-pressed months . His embraces became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He blamed himself . They loved each other and after days of separation when they came together he could not stop kissing and holdingher close . " Marty , let 's tell your mama we are engaged . Then the whole world can know and we 'll feel better . At least I will . What is common knowledge has to be true . " Martha saw how thwarted he had become ; she yielded . " Eli says he is going to tell Mother about his engagement to Anna on Christmas Day . Why do n't we join them ? " Instantly his dejection was gone . " Wonderful . We 'll buy her a gift . What do you think ? A book ? It will be a good day for us , a way station . " The three couples , Minna and Ignaz , Eli and Anna , Sigmund and Martha , brought gifts to Mrs. Bernays , Sigmund having chosen a copy of Schiller 's Glocke . Mrs. Bemays did not receive the news of the engagementsvery well . She sniffed slightly , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Eli who bore the brunt of the storm . After a week Eli showed up at the Freud house red-faced and ashamed , to announcethat he could not see Anna any more . Anna took the news quietly . Sigmund was outraged . When Eli had left , he cried : " What kind of a man is he to allow his mother to force him to commit a dishonorable act ? He knows he loves you and that you are the right girl for him . " " Give him time , " replied Anna stolidly . He had even less success in quarreling with Martha over the break . " I ca n't take sides against my family , " she insisted . " A woman who would denounce her own mother and brother would , given time and provocation , take sides against her husband as well . " Only a few weeks later Eli apologized , took Anna in his arms , kissed her warmly . . . and set their wedding date for the following October . THE LONGING SOUL 77Still Sigmund would not forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Eli , she moved in with the Freuds , assuring Anna that she had only wanted to delay the marriage , not prevent it . She then announced that she was going to move permanently to Hamburg and Wandsbek and that Martha and Minna would live with her there . If the two young couples wanted to be engaged , they could do so at a distance of five hundred miles . Sigmund commented , " I 'm not going to worry now about something your mother is threatening to do next June . " Martha slipped a cool hand into his , murmured , " That 's the Herr Dr. Freud I love . " " It will be a poor marriage if you are only going to love me when I 'm wise . " Ignaz Schonberg was not in sufficiently good health to take any reverse calmly . When Mrs. Bernays , whom Ignaz had showered with affection , announced that she would take Minna to Wandsbek , he hemorrhaged and became prostrate with grief . Sigmund stopped by the dispensary to pick up a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found Ignaz pale and listless , the freezing February weather aggravating his cough . Ignaz had two brothers who were doing well in business and helped maintain their mother 's house but would give Ignaz nothing . They said , " You have to support yourself . Who ever heard of making a living out of Sanskrit ? " Mrs. Bernays too had been hounding Ignaz . Not because of the Sanskrit . Her husband had imbued in her a respect for university life and its revered titles . But because she felt that he was malingering ; that he should graduate at once so that he could get a teaching job . Ignaz cried : " I need more years of study . It 's a vast field . I should masterit before I take my degree . " " I thought a scholar worked all his life to become an expert , " retorted Mrs. Bernays . " Why must you finish the job before you start ? " Sigmund had aroused the same accusation before he forced himself to take the exams for his M.D. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of the tonic . It was not until early April , when the fountains were turned on again in the Stadtpark , that the big opportunity arrived for Sigmund . Dr. Bela Harmath , an acquaintance , declared his desire to resign from Primarius Theodor Meynert 's Psychiatric Department in the hospital . Harmath had been a Sekundararzt , roughly the equivalent of an Assistant , but connected with the General Hospital rather than the university . He did no78 THE LONGING SOULteaching or lecturing , lived in the hospital , and took care of patients in the wards . He was a resident physician . Since the District of Lower Austriasupported the hospital , Sigmund knew that he would have to apply to the Lower Austrian Municipal Government for the job . Though the regulations expressly forbade a man to be both Primarius of a hospital department and Hofrat of a university clinic , drawing funds from the Imperial Government and the district government at the same time , Professor Theodor Meynert was allowed to break the rules so that he could carry on his brain research for the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sigmund 's opportunity had arisen in these wards , but how far from the wards could the research laboratory be ? He went at once to see his old teacher and friend in his office on the ground floor of the Third Court , with large windows overlooking the chestnut trees , and a series of small windows so deeply recessed in the beamed ceiling as to give the room the appearance of a chapel . These quarters and the work going on there were indeed holy to Theodor Meynert . He was a stumpy , sturdy , barrel-chested man with an unruly mane of hair flying on top of an enormous head ; nature was trying to make up in cranium what it had neglected in shin and thighbone . He was a fighter , an individualist , eccentric and crammed with intelligence . Meynert was born in Dresden , son of a dramatic critic and a singer at the Hofoper . He was a poet , balladeer , historian , drama critic , master of half a dozen languages , none of which he could speak worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " father of the architecture of the brain . " He did not claim to have invented anatomical brain investigations ; he gave credit for this to a long line of antecedents : Arnold , Stilling , Koelliker , Foville and in particular to his teacher , mentor and supporter in his fiercest battles : Professor Carl Rokitansky , chief of pathological anatomy . What he did claim was that he was the " chief cultivator of anatomical localization . " Starting with the mole and bat , he had worked his way through a hundred species to determine which area of the brain controlled which parts of the body , calling attention to the cortex of the brain as " the part of the brain where the personality-building functions are stationed . " He taught psychiatry , a term coined some forty years before , but rejected the term , insisting : " All emotional disturbances and mental confusions are caused by physicalillnesses , nothing else . " His career had been a stormy one . During the years that he had worked at the Lower Austrian Insane Asylum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spinal cord research , considering psychoTHISLONGING SOUL 79pathological patients as good material for exact scientific investigation .. . the cortex of the brain , the ganglion cells , the posterior central part of the brain as sensory , the anterior central part as motor . His critics , who were many and hitter , said : " To Meynert the only good lunatic is a dead lunatic . He ca n't wait until they die to get their brains for dissection . " It was here that he came in conflict with the German **31;13477;TOOLONG , the medical doctors who conceived it their job to study the mentally ill , classify their symptoms , set down their family histories since all insanity was hereditary , and attempt to alleviate their sufferings . Theodor Meynert 's superior at the asylum , Dr. Ludwig Schlager , had worked for ten years to improve the lot of lunatics and the protection of their property and human rights , casting off the chains with which they were bound , releasing them from dungeons and prison cells , giving them care , food , living conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defeated , so he insisted , by Meynert 's proclamationsthat only the laboratory work being done in his own Psychiatric Clinic had any value . Meynert was neither a cruel nor a callous man , but he maintained that he never saw a lunatic cured . The only cures would come from the brain anatomist who , when he knew everything about how the brain worked and what caused its malfunction , would eliminate mental illness by getting rid of the causative disease . The battle at the asylum became so bitter that Meynert was fired . He worked alone , in his private laboratory , continuing his anatomical dissections , abandoned as well by the university Medical School as having caught the dread disease of craziness from the asylum . Only two people stood by him : his wife , who thought him a genius , and his proctor , Rokitansky , who knew he was a genius . Rokitansky prevailed and , in 1875 , just two years before Sigmund became his pupil , a Second Psychiatric Clinic had been founded at the Allgemeine Krankenhaus and Meynert placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind would now be found in the brain anatomy laboratory . As a follower of Theodor Meynert , Sigmund knew that his teacher was entirely right . His ambition now was to get back into his laboratory . " Professor Meynert , I just heard that Bela Harmath is resigning and I 've run all the way here . If I do n't appear out of breath it 's only due to my powers of dissembling . " Meynert laughed . He had always liked this eager , gifted young man . They were well acquainted with each other 's temperament , though Sigmundhad not actually worked under Meynert 's direction since he had taken an intensive course in clinical psychiatry some four years before . Like many another scientist-artist at the University of Vienna , Theodor8o THE LONGING SOULMeynert had created a salon of writers , musicians , painters and actors as well as their patrons in high Austrian society . As a favored student , Sigmundhad occasionally been invited to these soirees . He had seen that the artistic world was as much a part of Meynert 's life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Meynert 's eyes were forever piercing their skulls to determine which local area of the forebrain made one man a dramatist and another a sculptor . " So you want to become my Sekundararzt , do you , and get back into psychiatry ? Ca n't say I blame you . " " Herr Professor , I 've got a research idea you will like . " " Tempting me , are you ? Very well , what 's the brilliant concept ? " " To begin an anatomical study of the brain of newborn infants and fetuses as early as we can get them . There could be some developmental studies that would give a comparison with the brain of adults . " Meynert smiled to himself . " You know , Herr Kollege , that the Primarius of a department such as mine has no power to appoint his Sekundararzt ? " " Indeed , Herr Professor , I 've long known that story . " " And you realize that you must apply to the Lower Austrian Municipal Government for the post ? " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are willing to appoint you , you must be named by the Directory of the Allgemeine Krankenhaus for any department that needs a Sekundararzt ? " " I understand that you can not intercede on my behalf . " " Unheard of . Prepare to commence work on May first . " He rose , stretched out his hand with a paternal grin . " I will be happy to have you working with me , Herr Doktor . You have a natural aptitude for brain anatomy . But not a word , you hear . We must handle this matter delicately . " 7 . On May first Sigmund moved out of his parental home . It was a happy event for the family because it meant that he was taking his next step in the long journey . The break would not have been a severe one in any case , for Amalie had already moved the family to a smaller , less expensive apartment four blocks down the Kaiser Josefs-Strasse , at number 33 . Young women were not allowed in the doctors ' rooms at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring Martha there on his moving-in day to help him get settled . He supervised the DienstmannTHE LONGING SOUL $Ihe had hired on the corner , who loaded into his cart the portmanteau of linens and personal belongings as well as boxes of medical books . He and Martha walked arm in arm to the hospital . The sky was a clear blue . It was an intensely exhilarating spring day , when the air of Vienna , straight down from the vineyards and forests of the Wienerwald , was intoxicatingly buoyant . Simply to breathe was an act of joy . It was the rebirth of the city after its cold wet winter . The townspeople were on the streets on their way to the shops , the coffeehouses , to transact long-delayed business ; and with them were the throng of colorful characters who plied the sidewalks as they plied their trades : groups of wandering musicians playing guitar , clarinet and violin ; decoratedtwo-wheeled ice cream stands ; street vendors selling oranges ; a pot salesman carrying his merchandise in a wide wisket on top of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsome , mustachedman selling cheese from a leather saddle hung over one shoulder , salami from the other ; the bread man with his wooden tub of bread strapped to his back ; the " pots and pans " repairman ; the organ grinder , bootblack ; the pretty young Waschermadel with flowered dress , puffed sleeves , black ribbon about her neck , delivering laundry to the nearby barracks ; butcher boys in aprons down to their shoes delivering packages of meat ; the Wurstelmann serving hot sausages and rolls from a stand on the street corner to handsomely garbed gallants and sweaty workmen , eatingside by side . Young girls in straw hats with aprons over their dresses were coming home from school carrying bookbags ; chimney sweeps , black with soot from the winter 's fires , in black leather cap and jacket and long black pants , had coils of wire strung over their backs and their hands filled with black brushes . There were knife grinders with emery wheels ; a Croatian selling handmade wooden baskets and spoons , the winter 's accumulation of merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months pregnant . Men on stepladders pasted posters of the new plays , operas , symphonies on the circular kiosks . And everywhere the buxom country women with their baskets of Lavendl called in their insistentmusic , " I have lavender . Who wants my lavender ? " " What a day to be alive in Vienna , " murmured Sigmund . Martha breathed deeply . " What a day to be alive anywhere . " They entered the hospital and made their way to the Sixth Court . Though , as Sekundararzt , he would have no official time off , for the Hausordnung said that he had always to be within reach , the young doctorsliving in the hospital traded hours and filled in for each other . He would be able to get home for dinner once or twice a week . His room on the second floor was twice the size of his Kabinett , twelve8z THE LONGING SOULby twenty ; the walls were of whitewashed plaster ; there was an elevenfootceiling and , at the far end , facing south , an arched window that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a deep window seat . The room got a great deal of sunlight ; the scrubbed plank floor and throw rugs were warm underfoot . " How pleasant ! " Martha exclaimed . " Oh , Sigi , I think you can be happy here . " " I had better be . It 's going to be my combined medical office , study , bedroom and dining room for the next several years . " She studied the room as it had been left by Dr. Bela Harmath . In the middle of the right wall , behind flush doors , was the wash cabinet with a pitcher and porcelain bowl on a thin marble shelf . Above the bowl was a mirror with towel racks on either side ; hooks to hang his white gown . Next to the wash cabinet was the stove , a supply of wood on one side , on the other a bucket of coal and a shovel . " Would n't you like to move your bed to the far end of the room , by the side of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapestry on the wall above it , you 'll see how gay it becomes . Then if you put that round table in the center of the room you could keep your bowl of fruit and nuts on it and there will be plenty of space for books and magazines .

It will give you the most light and privacy , especially if your door has to remain open any part of the time . Then you can move those bookshelves to the wall next to your desk . ' ' " Let 's do it now , " he said enthusiastically . Together they rearranged the room , put his medical books on the shelves , then opened the package she had brought with her : five colored cushions for his bachelor bed . She set them against the wall , fluffed them . He stood with his back to the window , amused . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She stepped back .

" He took her gently in his arms . " You are going to make a good housekeeper . " " I 'm already a good housekeeper . It 's just that I do n't have a house to keep . " The waiter arrived from a neighboring cafe bringing pots of coffee , boiled milk and trays of little cakes . Behind him came the young doctors he had invited to meet Martha : Nathan Weiss , Sekundararzt First Class , in the Fourth Medical Department specializing in nervous diseases , the THE LONGING SOUL 83coming neurologist of Vienna and by universal agreement the world 's most complete monomaniac ; Alexander Hollander , Professor Meynert 's Assistant and the hospital 's Beau Brummell ; Josef Pollak , an ophthalmologistalso in Professor Scholz 's nervous diseases ; Karl Koller , an intern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paneth from Briicke 's physiology laboratory . Martha poured coffee and milk . Sigmund could not take his eyes off her . He engaged in his favorite fantasy : they were married , this was their charming home , friends had come in for supper and lively talk .. . " Fraulein Bernays , you do n't have to worry about Herr Dr. Freud , " Weiss teased ; " we 'll scan all the female patients to see that he gets the ugly ones . " " And we 'll make sure that only the old crones are allowed to clean his room , " Hollander added . Martha blushed . " Gentlemen , you are kind . " The coffee was passed again and the cakes all eaten . Sigmund 's comradesbade them Auf Wiederse hen . It was six o'clock , time for Martha to leave also . They found it difficult to tear themselves apart . " Please sit in this big chair , Marty . So . Then each time I come into the room I will see you there . " He knelt before her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cast in flesh but must live as iron . ' " Tears sparkled in her eyes . Sigmund put his arms about her and held her to him . He enjoyed the rigorous routine of the hospital : up at six , down to the basement for a hot shower or tub , back to his room where the charwoman had left him a basin of hot water for shaving the center of his cheeks ; puttingon his long white ward coat . Then a checkup of the wards to see what emergencies the night had provided ; again to his room for a breakfastof milk-coffee concocted of barley chicory with a few drops of real coffee in it , rolls , butter , marmalade ; then to the Beobachtungszimmer , the B.Z. , Observation or Examining Room , to which patients had been sent from the " Journal , " the hospital 's Central Admitting Office , to take the case histories of the newly arriving patients . Midday dinner was brought in from a neighboring restaurant ; each doctor ate alone at the round table in his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirty gulden a month , twelve dollars ; his food cost forty-five cents a day , adding up to thirteen dollars . But now that he was working in the hospital , studentswere referred to him for tutoring , for which he earned three gulden an hour . As a Sekundararzt , even though Second Class , he was allowed84 THE LONGING SOULto practice medicine on the side , during those hours when he could be free from his duties . He could even go out to visit a patient , providing he arranged with another doctor to cover his rounds . Sigmund had no private patients , but Dr. Josef Breuer promised to share a few of his long-standing cases . There were many changes for him in his new assignment . Working under Billroth and Nothnagel , he had been an Aspirant ; under Meynert he was a doctor , spending seven to ten hours of his working day , which he felt was " barely enough , " treating and prescribing for patients who were not primarily demonstration models for classes or Aspirants . Meynert'sAssistants taught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory research . Sekundarl rzte were not permitted in the laboratories but Meynert had little love for regulations . By the second week of his service Sigmund was putting in two solid hours a day in the laboratory and , every evening after seven when the patients were retired for the night , working by lamplight amidst the jars of human brains preserved in formaldehyde . He slipped quietly into his role , relieving the tensions of the emotionally disturbed and mentally ill , a full panoply of whom was represented in the male and female wards through which fourteen to sixteen hundred patientspassed each year . Though Professor Meynert described his PsychiatricDepartment to Sekundararzt Freud as " the only State Insane Asylum of Austria , " this was untrue . There was the large asylum on the Lazarettgasse , where Meynert had originally worked . Nor were these wards an asylum in the strictest sense : an asylum kept patients until their death . Meynert 's Clinic was a classifying , diagnosing and teaching center from which patients were sent home or to other institutions , sometimes being walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the SpitaIgasse , then inside an admission gate and up a little hill planted with lawns , flower beds and trees . All that Sigmund Freud knew about mental illness he had learned early on from Meynert when the professor had lectured at each of these beds in wards , classifying the patients by the title of their disturbance , relating the family background to show from which antecedent the patienthad inherited his insanity , putting the confused or deranged ones through their recurrent attacks so that the student could see the manifestationsand be able to recognize them . " This man has dementia praecox , that one amentia , or confusedness . This woman is catatonic . That young man has alcoholic delusional insanity ; this case is cretinism , the other one dementia paralytica ; this is a manic depressive , this is senile dementia , this one has paranoia , that one a traumatic neurosis . " THE LONGING SOUL 85Complete records were kept on every case . Progress was being made : young Emil Kraepelin , working at the University of Leipzig , had just published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor at the University of Graz and administrator of the FeldhofInsane Asylum , was expanding his Psychiatry by adding dozens of minutely observed cases to each new edition . No one knew the cause of these disturbances . The doomed , according to Meynert , Krafft-Ebing , Kraepelin , simply inherited them from their parents or grandparents much as they did the color of their eyes or the way they walked . Nor were there any cures ; what was inherited obviously could not be hung back on the family line to bleach . Happily there were some few methods of alleviating the symptoms : electric massage , warm or cold baths , the quieting bromide drugs . Beyond that , one could only wait for nature to return the minds to normal . The first time Sigmund went into Meynert 's office he saw a manuscript titled Psychiatry on the desk . Meynert was still researching his last chapters , Weights of Brain Divisions and Influence of Cortex upon VasoMotorCenter . Sigmund looked at the new drawings of the midbrain and nervus facialis . " Your book is practically complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It has taken seven years , " responded Meynert . " Now I have proved once and for all that the forebrain can never give rise to hallucinatory phenomena ; nor are its so-called memories possessed of the slightest sensoryqualities . " " No soul there , Herr Professor ? " Meynert grinned , though weakly . Sigmund was teasing him , for Meynertwas the chief opponent of the existence of the human soul , maintainingthat all the work of psychologists searching for the seat of the soul , attempting to erect a science of ethics in human conduct , was not only wasteful and futile but also confused ; the true work on the human brain was being done in the laboratories. 8 . Professor Meynert assigned Sekundararzt Freud to the male wards . Sigmund was of several minds when he started his work with these hospitalpatients . He had no prejudice against them , as many doctors had . They were sick people and it was his job to train himself to take care of the ill , whether it was an infection in the foot or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special interest in their illnesses . He made a circuit86 THE LONGING SOULof the first ward to get his bearings . Some of the cases were simpler than others . The chronic alcoholics were drying out ; once they were over their delirium tremens they could be sent home until the next crisis . The accidentcases were of a different category , so were the manic depressives , the persecution manias , the hallucinatory cases , the surprising number of patientswho heard " voices . " Here was a carpenter who had fallen off a thirdstoryscaffold and landed on his head . His vision was impaired so that he saw everything double , his speech was too slurred to know whether he was thinking sequentially . Then there were the paralytic cases , with facial tremors , tics and paresis reflecting damage to the brain or nervous system caused by tumor , inflammation , abscess , tubercular meningitis , syphilis . Though the disease itselfwas beyond the reach of the physician , and could be understood only after death when an autopsy of the brain and spinal cord had been completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these cases should never have been sent to Psychiatry , but to Primarius Scholz in Department Four , specializing in nervous diseases . However the young Sekundararzte working in the Central Admitting Office nights and Sundays , as Sigmund would also have to serve one day a week , could not alwaysjudge what was wrong with a patient whose speech or hearing or behavior was affected . It was fifty-year-old Theodor Meynert 's ambition to record thirty thousandbrain examinations . As Sigmund moved about the ward , seeing every manifestation of physical ailment combined with mental confusion and irrationality , he wondered how Meynert decided , once he broke down the fissures of any one brain , just what malfunction had caused the combinedphysical and psychic illness . " Relatively easy , " Meynert assured him . " Take that case in the center bed . He 's dying now . When I get his brain I 'll find a tumor as big as a ripe tomato ! " In the corner bed Sigmund found an old Benedictine monk whose diagnosis read Confusion . When admitted to the clinic he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a war . He could not find his bed once he had left it , nor could he recognize any of the doctors or attendants . When Sigmund asked him how he was feeling he recited his history quite accurately , through the elementary school , Gymnasium and stays at various monasteries ; but for the past eight years he had been in a state of amnesia . He drank water constantly , a sip between each sentence , asked for a new bottle every few minutes : " I was at Hutteldorf , I was not able to get out of there as well as here . At Hutteldorf I have  --  I do n't know it , Lord , I do n't know it ! I am the greatest liar , if I knew that . What did they do at Hutteldorf ? Lord , THE LONGING SOUL 87I do n't know it ! Since I suffered from typhoid dysentery I have not been able to remember anything . Maybe I am in an insane asylum . What are you doing here ? Lord , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month do we have now ? ... " Sigmund left the man 's bedside ; surely this was a case of advanced senility ? In the next bed was a young son of a farmer , whose diagnosis read Mania . At home he had become uncommunicative , had not listened to what the family said , refused to answer questions . At night he took off his clothes and ran around the courtyard naked , then returned to cut to shreds his trousers , jacket and boots . He had been declared unfit for mili- tary service but his one ambition was to enter the army . He would not talk to Dr. Freud until Sigmund had found the right clue : " Wilhelm , what do you intend to do in the army ? " This unleashed a storm of exposition . " I want my clothes back . I came to Vienna with the mayor of my village to enter the army . The mayor promised to meet me here again . I do not feel sick . I 've always been healthy except for a fever when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so much work on the farm . If you do n't give me my clothes I 'll bring an ax against everybody at the Provincial Court . I have been stabbed and shot several times . What are you writing down ? You do n't need the name of my father , my father does not concern me . I was arrested for poaching . They beat me over the head with a gun . I was indicted by the court for larceny . That made me sad . I did not like to talk to people any more . I want to be in the army . " In the next bed was a fifty-two-year-old bachelor shoemaker . He was a small man with a pale bloated face and flabby muscles . " I 'm not a fool . I do n't need to be locked in the Fools ' Tower . I am be- ing persecuted by several persons . I 'll name them for you . Also by a Sun- day child who wanted to thrash me and stab me . My brothers and sisters tortured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must atone for this crime . My elder brother is feeble-minded . " " Do you know why you came here , Franz ? " " Because they made a fool of me at home . I hear scolding voices at the window in the night . They shout , Drunkard . We will beat you . ' That 's why I locked myself in . The Sunday child saved me from my persecution . Five years ago I satisfied myself with a goat and also with little children . I should be in prison . For two years I have been drinking . My father was a potator too . He died from alcoholism . " An attendant came to say that a patient in one of the isolation rooms was asking to see the doctor . It was a married grape grower who had fallen into a rage the night before . Sigmund went into the room , closing the iron door behind him . The chart said that the man suffered from con-88 THE LONGING SOULfusion , delirium tremens , anxieties , excitements , hallucinations of eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had suddenlybecome frenzied and run away , then after he returned , prayed on his knees for as long as five hours at a time . He maintained that he had come to the hospital in order to be cured of an ailment of his throat . " How is your throat now ? " " I 've always been healthy . Only for two years I 've been suffering from a cough . The neighbors locked me in because they thought I barked . I was only clearing my throat . I smashed the window and ran away . " " You did n't eat anything yesterday , Karl . " " Because all the food is poisoned . I am not going to let you kill me . I bought a house in Haugsdorf for six hundred gulden . You ca n't keep a rich man locked up . " Professor Meynert asked Sekundararzt Freud to take the morning stint in the B.Z. Sigmund had by now read several hundred " Admitting Reports " and knew precisely what was required of him as the first examiningdoctor . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by families , by doctors and by the patients themselves . Some were incoherent , mumbled meaningless sounds and broken words . Others talked a streak in disconnected phrases and sentences . His first case was a twenty-fiveyear-oldRoman Catholic graduate law student . " Medium height , moderatelynourished , pale complexion , " Sigmund wrote in the record book , " brown hair , reddish beard , blue eyes ; the left corner of his mouth is lower , which may be due to scabious scar . Chest and heart normal . " Heinrich related his story to Dr. Freud : He had been a weak child with a speech defect , measles , scarlet fever , diphtheria . Since his sixth year he had been frequently punished for petty thefts , which he denied having committed . He had flung a chair at his brother when he was ten . He had to leave the Schottengymnasium after the seventh grade and was sent to Krems to relatives . He spent large sums buying fashionable clothing in order to show off . He passed the Matura with average success and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social intercourse with the high aristocracy , took only a Fiaker as a means of transportation , had mistresses , defrauded the students ' fund when he was twenty-one . He passed the first law examinations but failed the third and last . He had the feeling of being tubercular , sometimes consulted doctorsfive times a day . He had spent one year at the Provincial Court studyingbut had been forced to give up his job because of debts . He decided to go to America with his family , but escaped from them , sold his ticket for half price and wandered about Europe living by theft and fraud . Sigmund jotted down very carefully : Megalomania , Insane and Feeblemindedbehavior , cure improbable . THE LONGING SOUL 89 " How am I going to go on with my career , Herr Doktor , if I am locked up here ? It is my brother who wants to ruin my career . I have never done anything wrong . Everybody is against me . I ca n't work too steadily because I have syphilis and tuberculosis . " " Heinrich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I have piercing pain in my left lung . If I keep all the records for the ward will they let me out of here ? " Sigmund assigned him a bed , prescribed potassium iodide . He was called to check on a young married man admitted during the night . The diagnosis read Disturbance of the Mind . He had refused to eat or drink . " You know why I wo n't eat or drink , Doctor , it 's because I 've got so much mucus , and because of this I have to die . I 'm parched but I ca n't drink any water because I 've got so much mucus in my throat . " Sigmund checked the man 's chart . The patient had never been physicallyill . His first symptom of mental abnormality was that of poisoning mania : he refused to eat at home because he thought his wife wanted to poison him . He went instead to a public house . He had become hyperexcited , unable to sleep , in the morning he refused to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much mucus . " Sigmund studied the patient . He was physically emaciated , had recurrentshivers , motor restlessness . Now he was shouting : " I am the spitting master of the world . At home I lay on the sofa for three weeks and was spitting all the time . My wife is a whore . " " Albert , do you know where you are ? And when you came here ? " " No , I only know that I am going to die . " Sigmund watched the man 's face . The reaction of both pupils was slow , his skin was cold , he was physically very weak . He probably was going to die because something had gone wrong in his brain , some disease had taken over . But what kind of disease made a man spit for hour after hour because he had too much mucus ? It was ten o'clock at night when a joiner , a day or two away from being discharged , asked to consult the doctor . He had requested to be committed to the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten drunk and on arrival at the Krankenhaus had been sent to Psychiatry . He was a married man with three children , healthy . After soberingup he was convinced that other patients pursued him about the ward and threatened to put his eyes out . " Do you realize that that is a hallucination , Karney ? " Sigmund asked . " Yes , I suppose so . I want to go home and back to work . But I suffer90 THE LONGING SOULfrom sleeplessness so much , and from anxiety . And then I begin to drink . . . " Sigmund stood staring out the window ; only the dimmest lanterns lighted the darkness of the court . " Why his eyes ? What sickness does this arise from ? The only thing I can think of is the line from Matthew , If thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : " 9 . Martha 's departure for Wandsbek in mid-June was more painful than either of them had anticipated . Eli intimated that he would be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of waiting ahead for both of them . Sigmund felt that the separation was dangerous for both couples ; at the same time he acknowledged that if their love could not endure a separation it could not last at all . He put his arms about her . Kissed her . " Once your mother started this action there was nothing either of us could do to prevent it . We have no choice . We must have faith in my work . That is the only thing that can bring us together again . " The next day they met for a moment on the corner of the Alser Strasse . They were so dry of lip that neither could utter the word " Good-by . " Too upset to return to the hospital , he went instead to visit Ernst Fleischl . JosefBreuer and Sigmund alternated as Fleischl 's physician , in between Billroth 's several operations a year , though there was little either of them could do except rebandage the thumb and provide morphine against the pain . Fleischl lived in a handsome apartment house built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male and female nudes , Greek columns , porticoes , arabesques , plaster cherubs . The elder Fleischls occupied the entire second floor but Ernst had arranged an independent apartment by breaking through the landing with a new door to give himself a large corner bedroom , behind that a smaller dining room , and on the opposite corner a combined library , study , office and sitting room where he spent his tortured , sleepless nights . Fleischl 's manservant admitted Sigmund . One wall of the study was solidly faced with books . On the other walls hung the Italian paintings his grandfather had gathered on his carriage journeys from Milan to Naples . Numerous stands , desks and tables held fragments of marble sculpturefrom Asia Minor , female torsos , heads of Roman generals , friezes , an Etruscan Bacchus off the Temple at Veil . THIS LONGING SOUL 91 " Sigmund , what a pleasure to see you . I had just told the cook I would n't be eating any supper , but with you for company we 'll have a fine spread . " He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it . When the manservant appeared he ordered a generous meal . Sigmund took off the bandage to check Fleischl 's thumb . Billroth had amputated again only two months before . He cleaned the wound and redressed it while they chatted animatedly . Fleischl had just taken up Sanskrit so that he could read the Veda in the original . Sigmund suggested some coaching by Ignaz Schonberg . Supper was brought in ; Fleischl 's good-sized dining table was filled with archaeological artifacts brought back by his grandfather from his journeys in Egypt and the Holy Land . There was barely room to set down the two soup plates . Fleischl explained : " When I eat alone I feast my eyes on these lovely pieces . It 's as though I were absorbing them instead of the liver dumplings . When I die I 'm planning to take these treasures with me . " Sigmund did not like to hear thirty-seven-year-old Fleischl talk about dying , even in a joke ; but the harsh truth had to be faced . This thumb of Fleischl 's was never going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took more years off Fleischl 's life . The pain of the wound was intense ; morphine had become the only solution . To Sigmund it seemed a travesty of justice ; Ernst Fleischl had everything to live for . His soaring intellect took him into realms that the rest of medical Vienna could not follow . " You know , Ernst , if I did n't love you I could be mighty envious , " Sigmundquipped . " The last man who knew everything knowable was Leibnitz , back in 1716 . If you do n't start rationing yourself you 're going to displace him . " An involuntary spasm of pain shot across Fleischl 's handsome face . Sigmundgave him an injection of morphine . During the day Fleischl was engrossed in his work in Brucke 's laboratory ; but the nights were long . Sigmund stayed until one in the morning , playing Japanese Go . He was uneasy : somewhere along about four in the morning , unable to endure the pain any longer , Fleischl would give himself another injection . He was addicted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the only ones who did . Walking back to the Krankenhaus through the deserted streets , he thought : " We 've got to get Ernst off morphine . That will kill him quicker than his thumb . " No one could endure that kind of pain without a means of relief , but surely there must be something less lethal ? 92 THE LONGING SOULThe hospital , Sigmund learned , was run by the Sekundararzte , of whom there were ten of the First Class and thirty of the Second Class , as he was . The Primarii were middle-aged men of wealth and outside practice who spent only a couple of hours of the day in their hospital offices and the wards . That left forty men to supervise and care for the twenty departments . Though the specialties were confined to their specific courts there were several places where the Sekundararzte could meet and become friends : the Journal , the central reading room , around the gas stoves in protected recesses where the young men gathered for a cup of coffee and " bassena talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the single water spout on the outside balconies of lower-class apartment houses . Their shared omnipresent problem was money . Because it was a common plight they developed a Freemasonry that made a common pot of their scarce gulden and kreutzer . One of the men in Dermatology had an embroideredsampler above his desk from John 12:8 , " ' The poor always ye have with you . ' That 's US ! " The First Class Sekundararzte earned more , thirty-two dollars a month , and had accumulated a few more patients , but they were also older and had greater obligations . Everyone scrambled for extra gulden : by tutoring , reviewing medical texts , seeking patients . They were all in debt to their families , friends , booksellers , stationers , tailors , coffeehouses . One morning Sigmund needed five gulden for Amalie . He tried two friends ; they sifted their fingers through empty pockets . After the midday meal Josef Paneth came hurriedly down the hall . He was poorly dressed as usual , his thin blue eyes reflecting not only his shy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rich backgrounds as well as those from the poor . Paneth , always uneasy lest his comrades excludehim because he did not share their poverty , made it a point to give the parties . Any excuse served : birthday , promotion , publication . He went to the restaurant early , ordered the dinner , tipped the waiters and paid the bill , then sat happily by . " Sig , I just heard you need a few gulden . " " I ca n't borrow money from you . It 's an unwritten law . " " Why am I excluded ? " It was a wail . " Because it is n't proper to borrow from a man who does n't need to be paid back . It smacks of begging . " " You 're a pack of snobs ! Why should poor people be allowed to lend and rich ones be frozen out ? " " Very well , Josef . When we want money for prodigal living and sin , we 'll borrow exclusively from you . " Paneth walked to Sigmund 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enduring the separation ? " THE LONGING SOUL 93Sigmund grimaced . " Enduring ' is the exact right word for it . And how is Fraulein Sophie Schwab ? You know you love that girl and ought to marry her . You 've been searching for a poor girl long enough . " " I agree . We 're planning the marriage this summer . " Sigmund enjoyed particularly the companionship of his associates . RobertSteiner Freiherr von Pfungen had recently been awarded his Dozenturin neuropathology ; he did most of the bedside teaching for the courses under Meynert . Sigmund had to be present at these lectures and demonstrationssince he was responsible for caring for the patients being used as teaching models . Von Pfungen had had excellent training under the great professors at Vienna : Brucke , Wedl , Stricker , Redtenbacher , Schneider and Barth , from which he emerged with a solid background in medicine , chemistry , the physiology of the kidneys and the mechanics of the cortical disorder of speech . He was particularly well liked because he never questioned anyone 's request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amiable way , of therapeutic monomania . " Sig , we 're looking for clues on what makes patients ' minds go through alternating periods of clarity and confusion . I 've found the answer : in the peristaltic cycle : the movement by means of which the contents of the alimentary canal are propelled along it . " " Would you mind clarifying that , Herr Doktor ? " " What I would like you to do , Herr Kollege , is to keep a record of the patients ' bowel movements , with precise timing from the beginning of the movement through the act of evacuation . Then collate this schedule with the times that their minds are clear or in confusion . I think you 'll find an inverse relationship : while the peristalsis is working the patient 's mind will be confused . Once the evacuation is over , the mental faculties becomeclear and will remain so until the next movement has its inception . What do you say to all this ? " Only one word floated tubularly to the surface of Sigmund 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow to offend . He promised to watch his patients as he had requested . A few weeks later Von Pfungen developed a new theory . This one concerned the cause of bronchial catarrh . " It has to do with the washing of the back of the patient , " he explained while they made their rounds of the wards . " I have enough evidence now to conclude that the right side of the bronchia is less often affected becausethe left , or weaker and lazier hand , does not wash the right side of the back as strongly as the right hand washes the left side . An interesting approach , do n't you think , Herr Doktor . . . ? " But the man Sigmund saw most often , and not always willingly , was Dr. Nathan Weiss , who at the age of thirty-two had already been living94 Tilt LONGING SOULin the hospital for fourteen years , the last four of them as Senior Dozent in Department Four . Weiss was known as Herr Allgemeines Krankenhaus . Josef Breuer , when he learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nathan reminds me of the story of the man who asked , ' My son , what do you want to be ? ' The son replied , Vitriol , the stuff that eats its way through everything . " Nathan 's gigantic self-importance was matched only by his appetite for work , his ability to burrow into things and hold on by his fingernails . He was forever in motion , delivered brilliant monologues , knew a little bit about everything ; but by concentrating on nervous diseases had become an authority in the field . He had fallen in love once , as a student , been rejected , and been frightened of love ever since . Instead he ran the Fourth Department . Dr. Nathan Weiss began dropping in for a companionable chat , sometimesinviting Sigmund out for coffee or supper . At first Sigmund thought he was just a new ear for Weiss 's extraordinary vocal cords but he learned that this was unfair . Nathan liked him and respected his judgment . " Freud , when you 've finished your training with Meynert , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then . I 'll make you my Senior Sekundararzt . I 'll turn you into the second best neurologist in Vienna . " " How close do you think I can get behind you , Nathan ? " " There will always be an unbridgeable gap between me and the next greatest neurologist . When you finish in Nervous Diseases you will bear the mark of Nathan Weiss upon you . " " ' And the Lord set a mark upon Cain . . . . And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord , and dwelt in the land of Nod . " " I know . Genesis 4:15-16 . My father tattooed the Old Testament line for line on my epidermis . " He went to the door , turned and said wistfully : " Sig , you have some sisters at home . Could I meet them ? I 'd like to marry a doctor 's sister . As soon as I 'm Primarius I want to set up my own home . It 's time for me to be married now . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the research laboratories were the same size , ten by twelve feet . Professor Meynert occupied one by himself with space set aside for his young Assistants to make demonstrations when they had progress to report . Von Pfungen shared the next laboratory with a Russian , Darkschewitsch , whose ambition it was to take modern neuropathology to Moscow ; Sigmund had the next laboratory with Dr. Alexander Hollander ; THE LONGING SOUL 95and in the last room was the first American he had ever worked with , Bernard Sachs , a twenty-four-year-old who had taken his A.B . at Harvard University , his M.D. at the University of Strassburg the year before , and was now doing his postgraduate work in brain anatomy under Meynert . Sigmund found him amiable and intelligent and enjoyed speaking Englishwith him . Dr. Sachs had a position waiting for him as instructor in diseases of the mind and nervous system at the New York Polyclinic . The only argument Sigmund had with Sachs was over the use of the word " mind . " Sachs kept talking about " diseases of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are looking at through your microscope is not a thin slice of a human mind . It 's a slice of brain . " " How can you separate the mind and the brain ? " Sachs insisted . " The brain is a vessel , a physical structure built to contain . The mind is the content : words , ideas , images , beliefs .... " " Indistinguishable , my dear friend . " Sigmund entered his own laboratory by a door in the corner . A workbenchhad been built around the room against the wall except for an area near the door where there was a sink and under it a big wastebasket for the rejects : pieces of brain , broken slides . On high shelves were the jars containing the brains sent over from the dissection room , floating in formaldehyde and wrapped in muslin sacks supported by string so that they would not settle to the bottom of the bottle and flatten out . Sigmund removed his coat , hung it on a hook behind the door , took one of the brains out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He held the brain in his two hands ; it was soft , intriguing , disturbing . Always with adult brains he had the feeling that there had been life here only a few hours or a few days before . The brain was oozing in his hands . For Sigmund it had a slight feel of jelly : pale , cream-gray-white in color . He washed off the particles of blood and set it on the board next to the sink . He picked up an eight-inch-long kitchen knife , not too sharp , and sliced the brain as though it were sausage , in cuts of a half to a full centimeter in thickness . He found a certainresistance . The room now stank with the odors of formaldehyde , alcohol and cut brain ; a peculiar death odor , musty , pungent and disagreeable . He moved the slices of brain to his workbench where he had to push aside earlier slices in slotted boxes piled one on top of the other with handwrittennotes between . He used his microtome for the very thin specimenshe needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles containing his solutions , in front of them his staining bottles arranged in the sequence in which he had to dip his slides . He took each slab of brain96 THE LONGING SOULwith his forceps , and with a small scissors cut out the section that was most pertinent and typical of the pathology . A messenger from the dissection laboratory brought a package containing the brain of an infant that had been stillborn the night before . It had not yet been put into formaldehyde . As Sigmund held it he found that it too was soft , slippery , but with more ooze to it . The emotional impact was difficult to take . As he sliced the brain and put the specimens under the microscope he saw why this infant could not have lived : it had developed a congenital abnormality , hydrocephalus , water on the brain . " If we can discover why the water ventricles contained too much fluid , what plugged up the openings so there could be no outflow , " he said to himself , " then we 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover a method of staining the slices so that certain areas of the nerves , nerve roots and cells , which had never been seen clearly because there was no way of making them stand out sharply from the surrounding gray matter , could be discerned . This was proper work for a histologist . But all of his attempts spoiled the cross section . He was amazed to find how many hours could go by , working by himself in the laboratory until midnight , while each new combination of chemicals either caused it to be too brittle , or to shrink , overhardened the tissue or threw it into folds . Dr. Alexander Hollander , who had been in the clinic for seven years , followed his work closely . Hollander was the son of a Hungarian physician , well educated in languages , philosophy and literature , a brilliant diagnostician and brain anatomist who often lectured to the students in Meynert 's absence . His thesis On the Theory of Moral Insanity was much admired . A charming man from a solid family , he dressed elegantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtly manner of a grand seigneur . Meynert claimed that no one had a greater capacity than Hollander to learn what other investigators turned up . Though the technicalwork of dissecting and mounting specimen tissue bored him , he never tired of watching Sigmund put together improbables in the hope of finding the right mixture . " I say , you are stouthearted in the face of failure . I wish I had your endurance . " " I wish I had your knowledge . Besides , you 're only a failure up to the thousandth try ; if you succeed on the thousand and first , you 're a genius . " " Then you must be mighty close to genius . " " Why not come in with me , Hollander ? I think I 'm getting close to something for handling the embryo and newborn brains . We could complete the experiments and write the paper together for the Centralblatt fill* die medizinische Wissenschaf ten . " THE LONGING SOUL 97 " Say , I have n't published in some time now . When shall we start ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and put out the cigar . Here , watch what happens when I harden pieces of the organ in bichromate of potash . . . or here , in Erliche 's fluid . . . . " Hollander was a splendid teacher . Sigmund had only to turn to him with a simple question and he would receive a recondite lecture on brain fissure . He was also an amusing man , with droll tales of the current theater , opera and Vienna society . His one limitation was that he left the laboratory early in the afternoon to prepare for his evening of pleasure , occasionally dropping back about midnight to see how Sigmund was getting on . When urged to help , he replied : " The light is too bad . Besides the technique is difficult . . . . " " It is , thank God . Otherwise anyone could do it . Hollander , why do n't you try hard work sometime ? " Hollander laughed good-naturedly . " You 'll never believe it , Freud , but while I was in Medical School I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to master brain anatomy , which I did . " " No one disputes that . " " Well , my dear chap , since I have acquired my expertise , why labor further ? My war is over . Before long I am going to open my own sanatoriumand be independent . You 'd be surprised how many rich families have one crazy member locked in a rear bedroom somewhere . Peering down those microscopes is for fanatics , like you . " When he had gone Sigmund sat idly on a high stool for a moment , his head down , thought : " You mean poor men like me , who need discoveries and publications and Dozenturen and patients and earnings and a wife and a home .... " He was transferred to the women 's wards to round out his training . The mornings were spent in the B.Z. examining the newly admitted patients . The first-of-July heat was suffocating . Not the tiniest breath of air came in through the open windows . In the outside court the foliage drooped despondently in the fierce white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter-weight suit ; his body burned under the heavy winter clothing . The first woman brought in was a thirty-five-year-old from Galicia who insisted on speaking in Polish . She had been arrested at the Schonbrunncastle for tacking pictures of saints onto the walls and trees . God had ordered her to do so , and her reward was that she would be the only one permitted in heaven . She refused to allow Sigmund to make a physical examination ; when he unlocked the corridor to the female wards she98 THE LONGING SOULpicked up a chair and attacked another patient with it . Sigmund immediatelyordered her put in the isolation ward . When she hit the attendants who attempted to clean her cell , she was transferred to the asylum at Lugging . His next case was an oldish wife of a landowner from Weissenbach , a small meager woman with gray eyes and no teeth except her incisors . He found that she suffered from erysipelas which covered her bottom , genitals and the inner part of her thighs almost to the knees , for which he prescribed dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that she had been beaten by her husband on the head , once until she lost consciousness ; another time he tore part of her hair out and threw her into the yard where she lay for an hour in the snow . Her husband had exclaimed when she came back into the house : " The beast is not yet dead ! " The woman bared her breasts . Sigmund called for a female attendant . The patient got very excited , lifted her skirt , behaved indecently , then soiled herself . Sigmund turned her over to the attending nurse . Waiting for him was a middle-aged unmarried household maid with a thick nose . She was in deep depression . She had gone to the police herself , complaining about her sad condition , and asked to be sent to the hospital . " Why are you melancholy , Fraulein ? " " I did household work for a high civil servant for eight years . I was dismissedwith an excellent certificate . But this certificate destroyed me . When I go for a job everybody thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't had work for two and a half years . Three months ago I tried to commit suicide by drinking vitriol but the hospital cured me . I 'm afraid of going back into the world because there are many people but no human beings . In the street people look at me strangely . When I show people my actual certificate they tell me there was a punishable relationship between me and my employer . That 's why I want to die . Doctor , if I stay here , will you help me get some poison ? " He examined the young wife of a grape grower from Lanzendorf . She was small and delicately built . She paced back and forth in the room with her head on her chest , gave her name correctly but would not answer any other questions . When he asked her whether she was married , she replied , " I do n't know . Sometimes I ca n't remember anything . Even earlier I was forgetful . " " Would you like to stay here with us for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not live in a beautiful building like this . I have too many sins . " " Would you tell me what the sins are ? " THE LONGING SOUL 99 " I do n't deserve any meals . I 've been bad and am becoming worse . I should be thrown out or killed . My parents should not have been so stupid as to marry . Then I would not have been in this distorted world . After their births , my parents should have been thrown into a well . I married a farmer I did not like in order to get out of my home . At home everything is distorted . Here everything is in order . " A nurse summoned him to come into the ward to care for a young unmarriedtie sewer from Hungary . She had been admitted by Dr. Meynert , who had marked her diagnosis Madness because of hallucinations and hyperexcitement during which she spent hours on the window ledge trying to find a way to jump . Her records showed that she had been complainingabout pains in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was compelled to approach them because voices demanded her to do so . During her first night she had had to be restrained in a rope creche . Sigmund ordered the netlike covering of her bed opened . The woman jumped up and tried to embrace him . She wept , complained about the bad treatment . Sigmund quieted her , asked when the pains had begun . " Ten months ago . From an ailment in the stomach . I had always kept away from men and now I got the idea that I can only be healed by a man . I began to run at every man and to kiss and hug them . My family locked me in a room at home . I tried to escape by jumping out the window . That 's when they had me brought here . " " What is that blood on your arm , Fraulein ? ? " " I bit myself . There is a man in my bed who wants to burn me . " She jumped out of bed , tore a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strangle herself . Sigmund ordered two grams of chloral hydrate to be administered . She was soon asleep . And so it went , this parade of pathetic souls : the thirty-seven-year-old spinster daughter of a farmer who had had a stillborn child as a young unmarried girl and was trying to convince everyone that she had not killed it , committed for running naked through the woods and telling the townspeople that every night someone was murdered in her parents ' home and their bodies hung in the attic ; the attractive married Viennes woman who saw ghosts and the Devil each day , saw the ceiling of the ward opening and people sticking their tongues out at her ; the **32;13510;TOOLONG worker who heard voices and shooting , and saw her daughter lying full of blood in her own bed after being chopped by her husband ; the woman in her late thirties who could not sleep nights because the body of her lover , Alexander , walked around with the head of her husband stuck on him , and who asked that a sofa be brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to her ; theI00 THE LONGING SOULelderly spinster who heard the voices of police and the barking of dogs , and who saw city people staring at her and accusing her of taking dogs into her house to have intercourse through the mouth ; the forty-year-old wife of a bank cashier , educated and well mannered , who believed that the whole city hated and avoided her because she had had illegitimate sexual intercourse , had acquired a venereal disease ( she had none ) , and had infected her husband , who left her because of it ... . There were even more difficult patients to be served : the incoherent , disjointed , unfocused , living back ten , twenty , forty years , unable to recognizethat they were in a hospital or that they were ill . He spent hours each day reading the cases being reported from Graz and Zurich , from Prague and Paris , Milan and Moscow , London and New York . Intense studies were being made of the hallucinations and delusions , the fantasies , anxieties , fears , the persecutions divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indeed Sigmund had determined from the monographs and books lying open on the desk before him , that these sicknesses did not arise in any one time or place or special set of circumstances . They were universal . The hospitals , the sanatoriums , the nursing homes , the asylums of the Western world were crowded with hundreds of thousands of these people . Their ailments were diagnosed : craziness , madness , dementia praecox . The treatment was simple . Quiet them with chlorides and other drugs , give them rest , try to make them see the difference between reality and illusion , give them warm baths on this day and cold ones the next , electricaltherapy and other massage ; but very little of this , as far as he could fathom , had any appreciable effect . Sometimes , if the patients were at the beginning of a sickness , they could be reassured and returned home . Howeverthe records were discouraging ; most of these unfortunates had recurrentattacks , were returned to the hospital or to prison or died by their own hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austrian Insane Asylum , walking them over to the building on the knoll of the hill . Von Pfungen committed the same number , but Hollander 's number was larger , with seven incurables , and Professor Meynert , who was called upon to judge the most difficult cases , was highest with thirteen . The time in the " disturbed " wards had both an emotional and physical effect on him . He ate little , slept poorly , lost a number of pounds which his lean frame could not spare . The combination of heat , crowded wards and the continuing outbursts of violence and mania had caused his eyes to sink in their sockets and put a thin crease down each cheek . As an intern , or custodial physician , he was not supposed to become any more involved in the miseries of those suffering in the mind than those sufferingTHE LONGING SOUL I0Iin the body . Yet there was a subtle difference . For the patient with a goiter or gallstones a doctor felt sympathy ; with the patient suffering from mania the doctor experienced fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never intended to work with the mentally deranged , he had not thought that he would get so deeply immersed . Now he began to sense , albeit dimly , that these unfortunate creatures had come too late to the fair . For the pathologist it was an enormously rich field ; there was so much about the human brain that still had to be understood in terms of structure and function . But for the attending physician who could give so little help ? And for the patients , most of whom seemed to be beyond help Looking back over the months and the hundreds of males and females h had treated , Sigmund thought dispiritedly : " It is unfruitful , this psychiatry . " BOOK THREEWALK A FINE LINEBOOK THREEWalk a Fine LineI cNAZ SCHoNBERG walked over twice a week from the university for a visit , sharing Sigmund 's light supper . The two friends read and studiedtogether under the light of the oil lamp on Sigmund 's table .

" Ignaz , you need a rest . " " Some other year , Sig , " Ignaz replied wearily . " No , this year . " Sigmund decided to call on Ignaz 's brothers . Alois was away but Geza invited him to supper . Sigmund had seen a good deal of the brothers becauseof his years of friendship with Ignaz . Geza was heavy-featured and heavy-set , a hard worker who , early in life , had declared that books were the natural enemy of man . Sigmund considered him stupid and conceited and lost no time on the amenities . " Geza , Ignaz 's T.B . is getting worse . " " What do you want from me ? " " Money . Enough to give him a few weeks in the mountains . " " Why am I supposed to pay for him ? I break my back for the gulden I earn . " Sigmund softened his tone . " We all have to look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is he so precious ? Because he reads poetry in Sanskrit ? You ca n't feed a hungry mouth with Sanskrit . " " If I can persuade Alois to contribute , will you give something too ? I 'll take him myself . I do n't want him traveling alone . " " All right , " grumbled Geza . " I give . Do n't I always ? " Sigmund took Ignaz to Stein-am-Anger in Hungary , leaving him with stern instructions about taking care of himself . He had been home a short while when Josef Breuer sent word to meet him at Fleischl 's apartment . The thin layer of skin over Fleischl 's latest amputation had broken open again . Fleischl was in misery . Breuer , who had brought the morphine , Iob WALK A FINE LINEgave him a shot of it . They were walking back across the town in the steaming mid-July evening with the very stones of the sidewalks and buildingsexuding heat , when a man came up to speak to Breuer . Sigmund dropped a few steps behind . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the husband of one of my women patients . His wife had been behaving so peculiarly when she was out in society that he brought her in for treatment as a nervous case . There is little help I can give . These cases are always secrets d'alcove . " " Whatever do you mean ? " Sigmund asked in astonishment . " The alcove containing the marriage bed , where neurotic cases begin and end . " Sigmund thought about this for a moment , then exclaimed , " Josef , I think you fail to realize how extraordinary the matter of your statement appears to me . " Breuer was silent . Sigmund walked by his side , puzzled . He had had no experience with " secrets of the alcove " ; he sensed a potential danger here for a man who still had several years to wait for his own alcove . He could not readily grasp the idea that married couples did not always do well in their marriage beds . Certainly he and Martha would .

He knew about the attractive young prostitutes in special houses , and the demimondes ( call girls ) who were always available . The more prosperous and less serious of his fellow students entering the university had quickly found themselves Susse Madeln from the country or the outlyingworkers ' districts , keeping them as mistresses until graduation , at which time their " sweet girl " shed a few tears and dried them in time to see clearly which of the entering freshmen would be the next lover . Marriedwomen were approachable for assignations ; he had observed a raised eyebrow by a fashionably dressed woman having five o'clock cakes at Demel 's , a whispered word by a man to a lady alone at a coffeehouse ; and there followed , he knew , the adventure and carnal excitement of a rendezvous . If one were caught there was always the danger of a challengeby an outraged husband ; but the duels rarely proved fatal . Sigmund Freud and his group of friends had known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had neither purse nor passion for it . They had been raised in the rigid moral code of the Old Testament ; they believed in romantic love ; spare and sparse gulden were wanted for the dozens of books they desperately coveted . But most important for these intellectual bookworms was the time and concentration that they guarded for their studies , discussions , clashes of ideas and philosophies . Dr. Sigmund Freud , who had dissected a dozenWALK A PINE LINE I07dead females , had grown up in sensual innocence of the live women about him . Once home Sigmund and Josef Breuer sat in Breuer 's upstairs office . Mathilde sent up a plate of refreshing Kraut mit Rahm , finely shredded cabbage cooked with sour cream and sprinkled with caraway seeds . Josef commented , " If some of my cases did n't come from wealthy familiesthey would be in your wards instead of my consulting room .

The wandering band with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow the chest , the next week the kneecap .

But why ? What causes it ? Thousands of bright , healthy men and women who need an illness , need a pain . A new patient came to me yesterday , a middleagedman important in the Viennese financial world who , when he walks the streets , sees himself surrounded by monsters , gnomes , bats . They brush past him and fly around his head . When he goes into a meeting , instead of seeing the faces of his associates he sees devils and creatures from horriblenether worlds . His business is prosperous , his wife and children are in good health . Yet he is living in a world of terror . I can see what he is suffering ; but what is he suffering from ?

" " I 'm getting Johann , for instance , thirty-nine , a bachelor , former clerk of the Franco-Austrian Bank . For some weeks before he was admitted there had been increasing absent-mindedness , indecency at home as well as in public places , panic restlessness involving rising at four in the morning to rush about the city . He bought things without purpose , stole senselessly . Today he smashed several windows in the ward ; when I asked him why , he replied : " My brother is a glazier and he should have some work . My father was a glazier , he died when he was seventy-one ; my mother is alive and well . She runs through the city for eighteen hours a day . I only came here to see the pictures .

Io8 WALK A FINE LINEHe was quiet while I examined him but once made ready for bed he climbed on a window sill and threatened to jump through the glass . I had to put him in isolation . He told me , I do n't know why I am here , I 'm perfectly well . For eight nights I could n't sleep . I always dream of the Madonna . I have seen her in my bed . Parts of the world have perished , monkeys have become men and will reign over them . Look up , do you feel the sun dragging out your brains ?

The sadists who stab women in the streets , usually in the upper arm or in the rectum , and have an ejaculation at the same time . The fetisherswho slash women 's clothes or steal their handkerchiefs to masturbate into ; the men who dig up dead bodies to have intercourse with ; the pederasts who attack young boys ; homosexuals caught committing obscene acts on each other in public lavatories ; the male perverts who dress like women and solicit men ; the exhibitionists who display their genitals in parks and theaters ; the flagellants who whip each other ; the female pervertswho practice cunnilinction and are turned in by the girls they seduce .. .

We can not take them off sugar the way we do diabetics , prop up their milk legs until the inflammation subsides . Brain anatomy has not yet provided us with a single cure . " Josef got up and paced the room . " Sig , I had a purpose in asking you about your cases in the psychiatric wards . You can not make a living from brain anatomy , much as you enjoy working in the laboratory . You can not make a living from the insane unless you want to join your friend Hollander in opening a private sanatorium . You simply must get over to the Fourth Department under Scholz , and into nervous diseases . " WALK A FINE LINE I092 . The best hour of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chores finished . He sat relaxed , happy in the vivid presence evoked by Martha 's picture on his desk , seeing her wave to him as she came up the path of the Belvedere garden to meet him , or walked by his side along the Beethovengang in Grinzing , embarrassedly turning to the side of the road to straighten a faltering stocking . As he read and reread her letters which reached him nearly every day he could hear her voice speaking the written lines , the low cultivated tone , the purity of diction , her gentle laughter . He wrote her long , intimate letters , withholding nothing of importance : his work in the wards and the laboratory ; how much he enjoyed the companyof the other Sekundararzte ; his suggestion to Fleischl that he use the gold staining device for examination of the retina of the eye and Fleischl 's acceptance . " To my joy because to teach an old teacher something is a pure , unmitigated satisfaction . " How Breuer had suggested that he move on to nervous diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longed for her when he read Byron . He loved to write , came alive with a pen in his hand . He wrote as he breathed , naturally , for writing resolved his ideas and refreshed him . He had considered himself a stylist ever since he had been given an Excellent on his German paper for the Matura . His professor had told him , " You possess what Johann von Herder , the German poet and philosopher , so nicely calls an idiotic style : at once correct and characteristic . " Seventeen-year-old Sigmund Freud had taken the comment as a compliment , writing a friend , " I advise you to preserve my letters , have them bound , take good care of them  --  one never knows . " Martha 's presence in his room did not fade ; her scent overcame the smells of the laboratory that he brought back with him no matter how much he scrubbed with the hard brown soap . Her picture was the first thing his eyes rested on when he re-entered the room . Yet when he sufferedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quarreled with her via the post . He could not reconcile himself to Mrs. Bernays having taken her daughters away from Vienna . Martha 's first loyalty was to him ! He accused her of weakness and cowardice in choosing easy paths instead of facing painful situations . Martha answered these pugilistic letters with : " I love you and I love my family . I will give up neither and be disloyal to neither . I will not allow any relationship to be destroyed . " IIO WALK A PINE LINEThe upward turn came quickly , within a day or two , after some rest , a long walk in the woods , a bit of encouragement in his work . He realized that he was using these letters as a catharsis , working off his impatience and frustration at his slow progress and the bleak years ahead . He also realized that Martha was bravely facing a difficult situation : her fiance ! Then he would sit before her picture , grateful that it was not judging him , and write from two to ten pages of repentance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get these letters to her by the seventeenth of the month , the anniversary of their engagement , he sensed dimly that his moods swung round the sun on their own cycle over which he was exercising no control . He was secure with Martha ; he could not destroy her love . Was that why he indulged himself ? Toward the end of July the Breuers joined the exodus out of Vienna for their summer house in the mountains of the Salzkammergut . " I would like you to take care of a patient of mine , Herr Krell , who lives in Potzleinsdorf , " said Josef . " Ride out with me and I 'll introduce you . " " What is Herr Krell suffering from ? " " Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . He is a little past fifty . About a year ago he began to feel some clumsiness in his walk . Six months ago this was accompanied by a slow shrinking of the calves . During the past two months he has had increasing difficulty in drinking ; he gags and chokes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is the cause ? " " We do n't know . " " And the prognosis ?

" It was a comfortable middle-class home with well-tended gardens , furnishedin the best Biedermeier , curved lines in the chairs and sofa backs , rails and supports , and straight lines richly decorated on the cabinets and chests . Breuer introduced Herr Dr. Freud as his associate . Mrs. Krell offered coffee . The patient 's ataxia had apparently increased since the last visit . Sigmund recognized the seriousness of his irregular stumbling gait . Breuer examined the patient 's calves , then called for a glass of water and mixed into it a bromide powder . " August should be a fine month for you , Herr Krell . Spend the days in your garden . Walk about as much as you like . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be reached at the Krankenhaus day or night and will come at once if you need him . " WALK A PINE LINE IIIBack in his room he found Nathan Weiss waiting for him , excited and flushed . " Sig , I 've made up my mind . Remember that mother and two daughters I told you about ? I 've decided to marry the older one . She wo n't be an easy conquest , I can tell you that . I am going to need help from an old boulevardier like you . " The courtship went badly . The girl was twenty-six , had already turned down a number of eligible suitors and quite honestly told Weiss that she did not feel any need for love . She criticized his manners , his loquaciousness , his statement of " I am the center of my universe . " She insisted that he would have to change his entire personality . He brought Sigmund two letters she had written , asking for an opinion of her character as shown by what she wrote . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectable , " respondedSigmund . " But I see little feminine refinement in her handwritingor expression . " " What are you talking about ? She 's extremely feminine . All I have to do is set her on fire with my love . " " But if she told you she feels no need for love ? " " How can she know if she needs love until she 's felt love ? The whole thing is an abstract theory until the right man comes along . " Sigmund asked quietly , " Nathan , are you sure you are the right man for this particular Briinnehilde ? She seems reserved , demanding and not very yielding . " Not long after , Nathan declared : " I 'm depressed . She 's grown melancholy , weeps for no reason , and takes no pleasure in my company . I set an early wedding date , her family is enthusiastic ... " " Nathan , the girl is conscientious . Do n't press her too hard . " Taking advice was not one of Weiss 's virtues . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested the balance of his savings to furnish their bridal apartment . Then he ran to Sigmund heartbroken . " Sigmund , when I took her to see our magnificent home she said , Nathan , why do n't you marry my sister instead ? " " I implore you to accept the idea that she does not love you , " urged Sigmund . " Take a long trip . You 'll come back detached . . . " " I do n't want to be detached . I want to be attached . I ca n't bear the fact that this girl could refuse me . Granted , she 's cool and prudish ; after marriageI can force her to love me the way I 've forced my way to success in everything else . " The marriage took place . Nathan , about to leave on his honeymoon , embraced Sigmund warmly . " I 'll see you in two weeks . I have a marvelous trip planned . " II2 WALK A PINE LINEDr . Freud turned his attention to Breuer 's patient . The first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assurance . There had been no deterioration . A depressing heat clamped down on the narrow streets . There was not a breath of air . The patients in the enclosedcourts of the Krankenhaus sopped up perspiration by rubbing their striped pajama tops across their chests . The only street activity was the occasional Dienstmann with cart , moving yet another family to a foothill village in the Wienerwald . Vienna seemed deserted . Then came a call on a beastly day . Sigmund was limp and dispirited . He did not feel that the long trip  --  Josef had warned him to take a Fiaker , no doctor could travel in an Einspanner , the one-horse carriage , or his patient would suffer a relapse of mortification  --  would serve any purpose . The instant he entered the Krell house he knew he had been wrong . Herr Krell 's ataxia had taken a decided turn . That morning when he stood up and closed his eyes he had lost his balance and fallen to the floor . And for the first time Dr. Sigmund Freud knew what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a physician . His listlessness fell away . He gave Herr Krell chloral hydrate to quiet him . When the man gagged on the liquid , he put him to bed , applied cool packs to his calves , massaged him . When Herr Krell dropped off to sleep , Sigmund calmed the anxious wife . " It 's just the summer heat . He 'll be much quieter for the next day or two . " " We thank you , Herr Doktor , for coming all the way out here in this miserable weather . " Riding back to the city , enclosed in its ovenlike stone walls , he could not ignore the personal gratification he had experienced in being needed . He had entered a home filled with dread and left it with the family reassured . He thought : " Poor man , he 'll be dead this time next year . I did n't do anything to help him , except for the next few hours . Then why do I feel so exhilarated , as though I 've been of some value in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved their practice and felt so strongly about their patients . He was summoned twelve times to the Krell home before Josef Breuer returned . Herr Krell sent him sixty gulden , two dollars a visit plus his Fiaker fare . It was the largest sum of money he had earned . He gave forty gulden to his mother , paid something on account to Deuticke , the bookseller , settled half a dozen small debts around the hospital , and still had enough left to send Martha the dictionary she had been wanting , meager consolation for the nights when his loins ached so sorely for her that heWALK A PINE LINE I13had to jump out of bed , don his clothes and tramp blindly through the streets in an effort to exhaust himself by dawn . The Sundays he spent in the Journal gave him a chance to read and write quietly ; not many people chose or were obliged to be admitted to the hospital on the Lord 's Day . The younger Aspirants came to him for counsel . When a disagreement arose between the Sekundarl rzte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances . He logically laid out the points that needed correcting . The director agreed that the rules could be loosened in several directions . Nathan Weiss returned to work but failed to visit him . The first time Sigmund encountered him at a meeting , he asked : " How is marriage ? " Nathan looked away . " I 've known better things . " A week later they met again . Nathan 's only comment was , " I 've been a wretched failure . " Early one morning Dr. Sigmund Lustgarten broke into Sigmund 's room , green of face . Sigmund was still in bed . " Have you heard ? " cried Lustgarten . " It 's Nathan Weiss . He hanged himself ! In a public bath in the Landstrasse ! " It was a shattering blow . The entire hospital was struck dumb . This was the last man to commit suicide ! Many reasons were propounded : he had been done out of a promised dowry ; he had spent his savings for a domestic disaster ; his rage had been caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these theories . He found himself unable to talk about Nathan with his associates . Instead he sat at his desk and spent hours writing Martha a letter relating the story . He then went to call on Josef Breuer . The two men discussed the suicide . " It is the most mysterious sickness of all , " Josef said , " almost impossible to diagnose . " " Nathan seemed to have an egomaniacal passion for life ... " " Apparently not , or he could n't have left it at the first adverse turn of fortune . " " Josef , I have the strange feeling that Nathan knew he was driving himself to defeat ; that in pursuing that unfortunate girl he was providing himself with a reason to be dead . " 3 . He made his discovery of a viable brain dye , though it took him several more months of lonely work deep into the night . He stayed with the originalconcept he had enunciated to Hollander , a mixture of bichromate ofII4 WALK A PINE LINEpotash , copper and water . He evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain specimen in alcohol . The thin sections were washed in distilled water , then put into an aqueous solution of chloride of gold . With the aid of a wooden rod each specimen was removed from the solution some four hours later , washed and placed in a concentrated solutionof caustic soda , which rendered it transparent and slippery . After two or three minutes he used a toothpick to take the preparations out of the soda , allowed the superfluous liquid to drain off . He then put the sectionsinto a ten percent solution of iodide of potash , where they almost immediately became a tender rose color , changing into darker hues of red during the next five to fifteen minutes . He transferred the preparation from an adult brain into alcohol and mounted it in the usual way . For the specimen from the brain or spinal cord of a newborn or embryo , he evolved a method of delicately bringing the preparation onto a glass slide by means of a camel's-hair brush , drying it without pressure and covering it with a piece of filter paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it enabled him to preserve the most sensitive slices . By his new method the fibers showed pink , deep purple , black or even blue and were brought distinctly into view , scattered everywhere through the white and gray substance . In the embryo , the nerve fibers were strikinglyclear . Those bundles which were already possessed of a medullary sheath were distinguished by darker coloring from the others . Examined under the highest possible microscope , the single axis-cylinders were so well defined as to enable him to count their number . It proved of great service in his tests on the nerve tracts of the central nervous system of the newborn child . He called in a group of friends to show them the process . Meynert and Von Pfungen were as surprised as they were pleased . Lustgarten asked to use it on some skin tests , Horowitz on his bladder experiments and Ehrmannon his studies of the adrenal glands . That night , exhilarated by their enthusiasm , he began writing A New Method for the Study of the Course of Nerve Fibers in the Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur die medizinische Wissenschaften , as he had predicted to Hollander . He wrote triumphantly of his success to Martha ; every success and forwardmovement , no matter how small , brought them closer to their wedding day . Two more weeks of experimentation brought him the fixative he wanted ; now the slides could be stored in the reference filing cabinet and be used for future studies . He was elated . He took the preparations toWALK A FINE LINE 115the physiology laboratory to show to Fleischl and Exner . Professor Brucke appeared . " Anything to be seen , Herr Doktor ? " he asked . " Yes , Herr Professor , brain gildings . " " Ah , that 's very interesting , especially since gold has the reputation of not being much use for this . " " But this is a new method , Herr Hofrat . " Brucke concentrated on the microscope , murmured , " I see . " When the series was completed he straightened up , his fierce blue eyes pleased and proud . " Your methods alone will make you famous yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expanded version for the Archie fur Anatomie and Physiologie ; and later wrote in English a similar account for the British Brain : A Journal of Neurology . Barney Sachs corrected it for him to make sure his English was perfect ; Sachs was a favorite in the laboratory , for he was also translating Professor Meynert 's now completed Psychiatry for publication in London and New York . Darkschewitsch asked if he could translate the article into Russian for his native neurological journals . That night he wrote to Martha : " Apart from its practical importance , this discovery has an emotional significance for me as well . I have succeeded in doing something I have been trying to do over and over again for many years . . . . I realize that my life has progressed . I have longed so often for a sweet girl who might be everything to me and now I have her . The same men whom I have ad- mired from afar as inaccessible , I now meet on equal terms and they show me their friendship . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I have remained poor . . . . I feel safe from the worst fate , that of loneliness . Thus if I work I may hope to acquire some of the things that are still missing and to have my Marty , now so far away and lonely as her letter shows , close by me , have her all to myself , and in her tender embrace look forward to the further development of our life . " You have shared my sadness ; now today share with me my joy , be- loved . " When he had sealed the envelope he wrote on the back of it , in English : " Hope and Joy . " Despite Nathan Weiss 's death , Professor Franz Scholz informed him that there would be no opening in the Fourth Department until after the New Year . Sigmund promptly got himself admitted to Dermatology , the department of syphilis and contagious diseases , continuing to be a Sekundararzt . He started on October first , to be greeted by young Dr.I16 WALK A PINE LINEMaximilian von Zeissl , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Von Zeissl was Sigmund 's age , a blond with a small downy beard and agate-blue eyes . His father , Professor von Zeissl , had brought the boy into the wards when he was six . The syphilis wards contained some of the most horrible sights to be seen in any hospital , decayed noses , gangrenous eyes , green ulcerated cheeks , chancre upon chancre eating out ears , a mouth , half a chin . . . Instead of being repulsed , the boy had been fascinated . Once he had finished at the university and had his M.D. he had gone straight as an arrow for Dermatology . He had only recently become a Sekundararzt , but it was his intent to succeed his father as chief of the division . He welcomed Sigmund into his office ; the world 's literature on syphilis was neatly stacked on the shelves . " Let me take you under my wing , " he said . " I love to teach and it will be the first time I 've had an opportunity to work with a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just assume that I am an undergraduate , Herr Doktor , I am completelyuntrained in this area . " " I will remedy that situation . First and foremost , our bible in these wards is mercury . When we pray we thank God for its therapeutic power . Did you know that the Arabs used it as much as five hundred years ago ? Despite this there are many hospitals and doctors in Europe who refuse to use mercury . I am well aware of the abuses ; I know that not all cases of syphilis are cured with quicksilver ; I know that the treatment is not suitable to all the different periods of the malady . But I have also seen how much help we have given , even to those who are going into mental deterioration ... He laughed . " As you can see , I am a fanatic on this subject . You have no objections to fanatics , Herr Doktor ? " Sigmund laughed . " If you mean single-mindedness , what other kind of man can make a great discovery ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by sheer accident ! Come , let us go into the wards . We have our patients divided into Fournier 's categoriesand we work through four methods . First there is the dermic method , putting the unction on the part of the skin where the sweat glands are most numerous , in the armpit , the groin , the soles of the feet . " He indicated a case of very early outbreak . " We simply touch these sores with tincture of iodine or Van Swieten 's solution . In the secondary period we use mercury . After some two months of treatment we send the patient home for two months to overcome the effects of the medication . ThenWALK A PINE LINE II7we bring him back in for a tertiary period in which we treat with iodide of potassium only . " Next he demonstrated the hypodermic method , beginning with the subcutaneousinjection of chloroform : 4t. . . in the hip , right at this spot . It is painful to men and nearly always unendurable for the women . " A disagreeable odor of bisulphite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sigmund listened intensively to Von Zeissl . He was never going to become a dermatologist but needed to learn how to handle the cases that might come into his office . " We plan to treat our serious cases for three to four years , " said Von Zeissl . " The patient will be getting mercury only ten months out of the first twenty-four months . At the end of the second year , along with the mercury , we administer iodide of potassium . In the third and fourth years we drop the mercury and go with iodide of potassium alone . Sometimes we 've been brought in too late , sometimes we can not check the disease and the patient dies . However , we manage to arrest a good deal of the syphilitic spread . The physiological action of mercury is obscure . I am working on that ; also an attempt to isolate the virus syphiliticus . " Sigmund learned how much mercury to mix in the baths ; the respiratory , or dermopulmonary method , in which he stood the patient in a box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrosive sublimate to rout the virus out of the lungs . Using the alimentary-canal method , he fed the patient metallic mercury , blue pills of bichloride of mercury , or iodide of potassium in a syrup of orange peel ; learned when to start the cathartic milk diet . He watched Von Zeissl prepare solutions of gold , silver and even copper , hoping to find quicker ways of arresting the disease . Partly because he could not get the smell of bisulphite of carbon out of his nostrils or his clothes , he buried himself in the hospital for the first weeks of his training , even refusing to attend the wedding of his sister Anna to Eli Bernays , with whom he was still feuding . He made his rounds , served his turns in the Journal as admitting physician , continued to work in Meynert 's laboratory between his rounds of the wards , and spent the evenings reading the periodicals . Syphilis was a venereal disease and as such was a dirty name . There was no way one could acquire the illness with honor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plenty of wives in the female wards who had contracted it innocently from husbands who had not so innocently contracted it from the prostitutes of Vienna . Soldiers , who had the highest incidence of syphilis in the country , were sent to the military hospital but all others who wanted care were brought toI18 WALK A PINE LINEthe Allgemeine Krankenhaus , since few , if any , of the other hospitals would take in anyone with a communicable disease . As with the mentally ill who did not get to Meynert 's Clinic , there were many syphilitics hiddenaway by families who could not bear to face the disgrace . Like the psychiatric patient , these people were pariahs . Sigmund found himself caught up in an emotion compounded of revulsion and pity. 4 . The IV Medizinische Abteilung was a catch-all for the baffling illnesses , particularly the nervous disorders which the Central Admitting Office of the Allgemeine Krankenhaus did not know how to dispose of . It was supported by the District of Lower Austria and the municipality of Vienna and had to accept any patient from Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Franz Scholz had found ingenious ways of getting around that stipulation , as Sigmund found on New Year 's Day , 1884 , when he was escorted through the five wards of the Fourth Department . There were one hundred and thirteen beds to accommodate the huge numbers of sick . Scholz conceived it his duty to remove every patient from his clinic as fast as he could ; sometimes before the diagnosis was complete or control of the illness anywhere in sight . " Wards 87 through 90 are a clearinghouse , " Dr. Scholz told his new Junior Sekundararzt . " They are not a rest home . Examine , record and move the patients out . " Dr. Scholz , sixty-four years old , had become famous in medical circles twenty-two years before for developing and perfecting the technique of subcutaneous injection , using a hypodermic syringe . He had started as a philosophy student at the University of Prague and come to Vienna for his medical education . For some sixteen years he had been in a position of power at the General Hospital , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sigmund knew his reputation . In his young years Scholz had been a brilliant innovator ; he had published in the Vienna medical journals , had made important contributions to the contamination statistics of syphilis , done a study on Mental Diseases of Prisoners in SolitaryConfinement . In his early forties , after the medical world put into general use his technique of subcutaneous shots and honored him for his pioneering work , the flair for original investigation died out . He had settledback comfortably into the role of administrator . He was a heavy-set man , wearing thick coats and vests , with one of the most effulgent stands of mustache and beard favored by the hirsute of Vienna . To compensate for the baldness on top of his head , he wore hisWALK A NINE LINE 119back hair several inches thick and down to his coat collar ; a formidablelookingman , it was conceded , with his huge bony Roman nose and sharp eyes . To Sigmund it seemed tragic that he no longer searched out scientific problems but was content to keep down the costs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sekundararzte were denied expensive medicines or new drugs , electric machines or other equipment which they thought might help the patient . Sigmund was immediatelytold of Scholz 's passionate insistence that the beds in the wards be the regulation distance apart . " But you will find that this is a good department in which to learn , " said Senior Sekundararzt Josef Pollak , six years older than Sigmund . " As long as your methods do n't require money , Scholz will let you strictly alone . If you have to cadge extra days for the really sick ones , that will serve to develop your ingenuity . " Sigmund was glad to be in Nervous Diseases at last , the department in which Josef Breuer thought he would have his greatest opportunity . Yet it was a sharp turn in the road ; not only was there no teaching , lecturingor demonstrations , there were no research laboratories attached . Josef Pollak was working with Exner in Brucke 's laboratory on otological machinery . He said sotto voce : " I want to specialize in disturbances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I feel as though I 'm about to catch a few of the more revolting ones myself . By the way , all young doctors working under Scholz have to remain staunch friends ; it 's the only way we can put down the Primarius . " Sigmund asked Professor Meynert 's permission to continue in the brain anatomy laboratory . He found his charges in the Fourth Court a mixed group , result , in good part , of the " eyesight " judgment of the Journaldienst who admitted them off the street . The process kept Primarius Scholz furious : his beds were filled with patients who patently belonged in other departments ! He transferred them fast . The other Primarii were not offended ; every departmentwas interested in nervous diseases , for the nervous system affected the health of every part of the body . By getting up early Sigmund could finish his round of the wards by nine-thirty and be in Meynert 's laboratory by ten . He made a second round of the wards after midday dinner , finishing by five . He then read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work until midnight . So many cases of facial paralysis were coming into both Meynert 's and Scholz 's wards that he decided to do a study of these pareses , and facial tics as well . Early in his first week an impoverished tailor 's apprentice was admitted to the ward . He had had a bad attack of scurvy . Sigmund found his bodyI20 WALK A PINE LINEto be covered with the black and blue blotches caused by hemorrhages belowthe skin . The young man proved apathetic under examination ; there were no other symptoms . The next morning the chap was unconscious . The evidence suggested a cerebral hemorrhage . Sigmund returned to the bed after he had toured the ward and remained most of the morning and afternoon , annotating the development of the illness . There was nothing he could do but it was important to learn what was wrong . At seven o'clock that evening a symmetrical paralysis developed . An hour later the man was dead . That night and the next morning Sigmund wrote an eighteenpagepaper on his observations and his diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the autopsy proved him right , he sent the paper off to the Medical Weekly . It earned him ten gulden he badly needed , and established him among his associates in the Fourth Department . The department also had its Beobachtungszimmer . The B.Z. was under the command of Dr. Josef Pollak , who enlarged Sigmund 's diagnostic techniques . Sigmund 's first case was a forty-two-year-old woman suffering from acromegaly . Over the past five years she had noted that her shoe size had gotten considerably bigger , that her hands were growing larger . Her husband had been aware that her facial features were becoming gross . She was not ill , though she had a general sense of weakness . Sigmunddiagnosed it as a tumor of the pituitary gland . " What begins it , and what 's the treatment ? " he asked Pollak . The Senior Sekundararzt shrugged . " Nobody knows , Sig . And there is no treatment . The grossness occurs where there is bony structure . The prognosis ? She can live for fifty years . The grossness will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long do we keep her here if there is no treatment ? " " Just long enough to study her . " The next patient it was his duty to examine was a twenty-five-year-old man who had developed sudden and excruciating head pains during intercourse . He described them as mainly from the back of the head , " a feeling of hot water " going down his neck . Neither Dr. Freud nor Dr. Pollak had any notion what could be bothering him . They sent him home . Ten days later , while having a bowel movement , he had another severe pain in the head and collapsed . By the time they brought him into the hospital he was in a coma . Primarius Scholz was called . He declared it apoplexy . Pollak looked at the man 's fundus with the ophthalmoscope and saw a hemorrhage in the eye . He said in an aside to Sigmund : " It 's an aneurysm . There is a balloon on the wall of the artery which gets bigger and makes the wall thinner , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born with it . " WALK A PINE LINE I2IThe man died that night . Under autopsy they found the loose , ruptured aneurysm . The attacks had been caused by straining : at intercourse and to get a bowel movement . The strain had raised the blood pressure and exploded the balloon . Josef Pollak had redeemed himself . The next morning he said to Sigmund , " Come with me into ward 89 ; I 'm going to try an experiment . It 's that thirty-year-old attractive woman who has been in the hospital for months and has n't been able to move her legs . She also suffers numbness to the waist . Yet there is not one objective evidence of disease . Her reflexes are normal . " They went into the ward . Pollak said gravely : " Fraulein , last night we completed tests on a new drug . It can produce a movement of your legs within sixty seconds . However it is extremely dangerous ; it can cause death . If it were my legs I would take the gamble . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicine in this hypodermicsyringe . " The patient shuddered . She whispered , " It can kill me , Herr Doktor ? How soon ? " " Within a week . But you could also be cured of the paralysis within sixty seconds . Would n't you rather be dead than be paralyzed for the rest of your life ? " The woman closed her eyes for a moment , shocked at Pollak 's bluntness , then opened them wide . " Inject the medicine . " Josef Pollak made the injection high on the arm . Sigmund knew there was no such new drug and was terrified that the patient might react to Pollak 's suggestion and expire before their eyes . Before half a minute had passed he saw her legs begin to tremble under her gown and at the end of a minute she had moved one of them up into the air . She cried , " I can move . I can move my legs ! I am not paralyzed any more ! " Pollak patted her shoulder , wiped the perspiration off her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved your own life . Now you can return to normal . " As they walked away Sigmund asked quietly : " What was that miraculous new drug , H2O ? " " Precisely . This was a case of hysteria . I doubt that it was malingering . " " Why did you frighten the poor woman so ? " " Because the element of danger must be there . Sometimes the resolution to face death gives the courage to face life . " Sigmund shook his head , bemused . " Herr Doktor , you ought to be actingfor the Karlstheater . That was one of the most convincing performancesI 've ever seen . " Pollak threw him a shrewd look . " What makes you think a doctor doesn'tI22 WALK A FINE LINEhave to be an actor ? We act all the time . To the man with a fatal disease we turn a reassuring smile and tell him that he is suffering from nothing that can not be cured by a strong physic . When a neurotic woman tells us that no doctor has been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform her that she has a rare disease and give her a bottle of sugar pills . This cures her . . . for at least thirty days . If we are completely baffled by a patient'ssymptoms we put on our most intelligent expression and murmur , Yes , yes , we have our diagnosis now and should start getting results very quickly . " Sigmund thought with some longing of the comparative honesty of the laboratory . What could be proved to be true under a microscope was true , and what was false was false. 5 . There were times when it appeared that the stars must be conjoining against him . His thirty-six-dollar salary as Sekundararzt was all he had . Even the tiniest additional income ceased . There were no patients , no students requiring tutoring , no medical publications to review for the journals . His clothes were growing threadbare and he could no longer afford to go to the barber to have his hair or beard trimmed . He went for days without a gulden in his pocket , cut off from his Stammtisch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interns . He became too embarrassed even to browse among the new publicationsat the bookstore . Though he had had scant money to spare for the theater , he had been able occasionally to join a group of his companions at the university at six in the morning to wait in line for the tickets which would allow them to stand in line again at five in the afternoon at the Hofoper or Theater an der Wien to buy a standing-room ticket , then race up the stairs to get a front position where one had a protective railing to lean against . He had stood from five in the afternoon until midnight to hear Mozart 's The Magic Flute , Figaro or Don Giovanni . Since the middle years of the Sperlgymnasium he had saved his pocket money , sometimes for weeks , to see the finest plays of German literature done by the repertory actors of the National Theater near the Hof : Goethe 's Faust , Schiller 's Wilhelm Tell , Grillparzer 's Die Ahn f rau . The greatest treat of all was when his parents or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet or Macbeth or Twelfth Night , whole passages of which he knew by heart . In the summer months he was amused by the light comedies and bawdy farces in such outdoor theaters as the Furst in the Prater , or the Thalia . The theaters of Vienna were the mostWALK A PINE LINE I23effective matrimonial agencies ; the young people promenaded during the several very long entr'actes , catching an eye , wangling an introduction , starting the flirtatious " salon chatter " that led to invitations , friendships , marriage . Sigmund and his friends had been too poor and had too far to go in their professions to be caught in the marriage mart , but elaborately gowned and groomed young folk from all over the Empire had come to the capital city to make a handsome and convenient alliance . The spectacle was often as interesting as anything being acted on the stage . The Philharmonic played in the Musikvereinsgebaude , and one o'clock of a Sunday in the Musikvereinsgebaude was the place of the week in Vienna . Sigmund had been able to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frequently a family 's most valuable possession , handed down from father to son . The Abonnenten , those who had the same seats every season , would have incurred more social obloquy for selling their subscription than their virtue . Genuine music lovers who could not get in complained that half of the orchestra seats were occupied by the legendary " Frauen " Xanthippes who , all Austria insisted , slept nine times through Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony . The deprivation of the Philharmonic concert was not far-reaching . Vienna resounded with music . Military bands blared away ; Viennese popular marches echoed from the Ronacher Theater by the famous Deutschmeisterregimental band ; in the Kursalon of the Stadtpark an orchestra played romantic melodies ; in the Volksgarten one could hear Mozart and Beethoven ; in the Gartenbau Restaurant , enchanting Viennese waltzes . In the evenings folk singers entertained in the beer and wine gardens , under bowers surrounded by trees . " Why should we not love music ? " the Viennese asked . " Did we not inventit ? Most of the world 's great music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , by Mozart , Beethoven , Schubert , Haydn ... . What other city could match such an array ? " Vienna loved her music . " And why not ? " asked her detractors . " Can you imagine a better way to keep from thinking ? " Sigmund finally reached the point where he had no kreutzer with which to buy the stamps for his letters to Martha . He went home only rarely , for he did not want his parents to see how seedy he looked . The family was in dire straits as well , the cupboard bare . Amalie awoke each morning to pray that manna would fall through the kitchen ceiling . Guilt weighed heavily on him ; here he was , nearly twenty-eight , a highly trained professional , but he could contribute nothing to the family , which was barely subsisting on Alexander 's wage of six gulden a week . Mitzi had been promised a job as a bonne in Paris , but not until summer . Dolfi and Pauli were also looking for jobs . Jakob had been persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Odessa where a good business opportunitywas presenting itself . He had returned empty-handed , and crushed . Sigmund bumped into his father accidentally one chilly April afternoon on the Franzenring between the Rathaus Park and the gleaming white Burgtheater , ten years in the building and still several years from completion . Jakob was half a block away , his thin chin buried in the collar of his heavy overcoat , scuffling a little . Sigmund loved his father deeply ; he had had nothing but warm affection and support from him from the moment of his birth . He put a bright smile on his face , stood still on the sidewalk and let Jakob walk into his arms . He kissed his father on both cheeks , then conjured up the biggest lie he could think of . " Papa , how wonderful to meet you . I was coming home for the Jause to tell you the news . I have some money coming , a respectable sum . " A small humorous smile came into Jakob 's eyes . " Sigmund , your little toe is cleverer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science . You have no talent for fairy stories : " " Is there something on the horizon for you , Papa ? " " Of course . I have good projects and high hopes . " Sigmund raced through the park , past the university and up the Wahringer Strasse to the Krankenhaus . Once in his office , he wrote a letter to his half brothers in Manchester asking that they send Jakob enough money each month to preserve their father 's health and dignity . As soon as he could complete his training he would support Jakob , meanwhilethey owed it to their father . . . Philipp and Emanuel sent a generoussum . A few evenings later in response to a summons , he went to visit his old friend , Professor Hammerschlag , who lived with his wife and children in the Brandstatte . Hammerschlag had been Sigmund 's teacher at the Sperlgymnasium . He was retired now , after fifty years of service , on a modest but adequate pension . Hammerschlag had a paternal attitude toward Sigmund ; he had loaned him small sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to accept money from a man in such modest circumstances . Hammerschlag told him : " I suffered great poverty in my own youth . I can see nothing wrong in accepting help from those who can afford it . " Josef Breuer , also helping Sigmund , agreed . Sigmund said , " Very well , I guess I can be indebted to good men and those of our faith without a feeling of guilt . " Fleischl , when he heard this sentiment as he too was trying to lend Sigmund a few gulden , nearly took his head off . " Now what kind of parochialism is that ? You are willing to be inWALKA FINE LINE I25debted to good men of your own faith . ' Does money have a religion ? Is there a difference between Jewish debts and Catholic debts ? When you are a prosperous doctor are you going to refuse to lend money to a Christianmedical student who needs help ? You are not ! Sig , you have fewer ghetto remnants than any Jew , and I 've worked with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to any of the externals of your religion , yet somewhere in the back of your mind you 're still making invidious distinctions . You simply must batter down the residue of those walls . " " You 're right , Ernst . I will try , " Sigmund had answered thoughtfully . " And thank you for the loan . " Hammerschlag combed his scant white hair forward over his forehead , leaving only his gentle Talmudic eyes and short nose visible between the white mustache and beard . " Sigmund , my son Albert needs help at the Medical School . He 's having problems in one or two areas . Can you do anything for him ? " " Of course . Have him come to my apartment between five and six . I 'll brush him up in his weak subjects . " " I knew you 'd say that . But that was not my reason for asking you to drop in . A rich acquaintance has given me fifty gulden for a worthy young man in need . I mentioned your name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to the other end of the room , gazed sightlessly at the Hammerschlags ' worn furniture . How could word of his desperate straits have reached Professor Hammerschlag ? And how could the man afford to give up fifty gulden of his small monthly pension ? It was an incredible act of kindness . " Professor Hammerschlag , I wo n't conceal the fact that I need the money . But I simply can not take it . " Hammerschlag pressed the notes into Sigmund 's hand . " Use it . Lighten your burdens . " Sigmund gulped . " You know , Professor , I must give it to my family . " " No ! I am against such a move . You are working hard and can not affordat this moment to support other people . " Then Hammerschlag relented . " Very well , give half the money at home . " These were times when Sigmund thought , in the privacy of his own brainpan , that the astrologists might have a point : at certain periods the planets became obstructionist and everything went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything started to go right . A medical pupil was sent to him for a complete course in brain anatomy , for which the student would pay handsomely if Dr. Freud would cram it into a fourweekperiod . A friend sent him a patient , the fruit seller from the Three Ravens , where one turned off the Seitenstettengasse . She suffered fromI26 WALK A PINE LINEa continual buzzing in the ears . Sigmund had her ears examined by Dr. Pollak to make certain there was nothing organically wrong , then treated her with electricity . The noise of the machine must have drowned out the buzzing , for she went home cured . The next morning she returned with a basket of fruit for the Herr Doktor . Josef Paneth sent word from the Physiology Institute that he would like to visit with Sophie , whom he had married six months before , and would drop in for the Jause the followingafternoon , bringing little sandwiches and cakes . Would Sigmund please prepare the coffee ? The Paneth wedding had been beautiful ; after the religious service there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a band played waltzes , an afternoon of entertainmenthad been provided by the finest singers , dancers and acrobats Josef could find . He did not need to play the poor boy . He had a gemutliches wife who kept open house so that his friends could enjoy good food and drink and cigars at least one day a week . Frau Paneth had begun to dress Josef in the best woolens , shirts and boots available . His days of living like an anchorite had been dissolved . Sigmund commented on how well he looked . " I have found to my delight that my bride has more brains than I have , " exclaimed Josef . " See this marvelous idea she came up with . Sophie , show Sig the bankbook . The Sigmund Freud Foundation . We have deposited fifteen hundred gulden into an account in your name . The interest each year amounts to eighty-four gulden , which will enable you to visit Martha . " Sigmund stared at his friend , uncomprehending . " Josef , Sophie , what are you saying ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So that I can use the interest to go to Wandsbek ? ... " Josef chuckled . " Oh , nothing so restricted . The fifteen hundred gulden are yours to use for any purpose . If you want to marry right away , the money is yours . If you want to set up your medical practice here in Vienna , or flee to America , the money is yours . " " Josef , it is a story out of Hans Christian Andersen . " His hand trembled ; he spilled some of the coffee from the pot onto the cloth . Sophie took the pot from him . He murmured , " I have received acts of friendship ; perhaps I 've been able to do a few modest ones in return . But this is magnificence ! My children will bless you unto the seventh generation . " When the Paneths had left , Sigmund took the bankbook , the first he had ever owned , and set it on the desk next to Martha 's picture . He determined that the money was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interest he would withdraw as often as the bank allowed and turn it over to his parents . However the master sum would have to be saved for a very urgent purpose ; either marriageWALK A PINE LINE 127as Sophie favored , or , as Josef had said , the opening of his private practice . The planets did indeed seem to be orbiting properly . Ignaz Schonberg also received good news . Professor Monier Williams invited him to OxfordUniversity to work with him in editing a new Sanskrit dictionary . He offered a salary of  --  , ago , and Ignaz 's name on the title page as collaborator . It would be most important in getting his university professorship . The Bernays sisters would receive letters of good cheer . The sick continued to pour into Scholz 's Nervous Diseases even as they had into Billroth 's Surgery , Nothnagel 's Internal Medicine , Meynert 's Psychiatry and Von Zeissl 's Dermatology . A woman of thirty had fallen off a ladder and hit the back of her head on a rock . She had been brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later ; blood was coming out of her left ear . He recognized a brain concussion with a basal fracture of the skull , the fracture going through the petrous bone , with a tear in the eardrum . The proper procedure was to let her alone . She would probably wake up by that evening . They had only to guard against a meningitis infection of the brain covering . He would be able to send her home in four days . This he did , though she still had a headacheand deafness on the left side . For the following patient he needed Dr. Karl Koller in Ophthalmology : a bookkeeper complained of headaches and could not see the numbers on the right side of his ledgers . He also had haziness on the left side of his vision when he looked straight ahead . Koller put his hands on the side and to the rear of the man 's head . Slowly he brought them forward . First the doctor 's right hand entered the patient 's field of vision , and then , when it was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain dissections where the tumor would be : in the pituitary area , pressing up between the optic nerves . The man would be blind in one to five years . There was no help for him ; no use to keep him except to complete the record . He was advised to find work at something where his eyes were not so important . Day after day they came ; hundreds of them , all ages , sizes , shapes , with all degrees of illness . There were the patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , suffering clumsiness in their walk and ataxia ; there was cerebral thrombosis with one side or the other paralyzed ; there was locomotor ataxia ; progressive muscular atrophies with the slow wasting away of the muscles ; cases of multiple sclerosis accompanied by convulsions ; strokes ; lead poisoning ; brain tumors ; meningitis ; patients who jerked , trembled and fell ; patients with sciatica , hernia , aberrations of the senses . The most difficult task of the doctor in Nervous Diseases was the alI28 WALKA FINE LINEleviation of pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , opium . He gave himself a course in the Materia Medica , learning the natural history of drugs , their physiological properties , dosage and remedialapplication . And then there were the hysterics , all of them women , since the word " hysteria " came from the Greek word hyster , meaning uterus . Men did not have a uterus and therefore could not become hysterical . Early medicalbooks stated that if the uterus moved around in a woman it caused various kinds of outbreaks ; the treatment was to get it back into its proper place . Sigmund recalled the case of the woman to whom Dr. Pollak had given an injection of water . Yet he found that it was also easy to be fooled . He judged one case to be hysteria , and when the patient died a few days later the autopsy proved there had been a cancer . The hysteria had existed side by side with the fatal malady . He reasoned : " Let that be a warning to me that I must never oversimplify ! Behind illnesses there are other illnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disturbances . " Here was an area of investigation that could be as important and excitingas the research in Meynert 's laboratory. 6 . He came upon the subject by accident , while reading the December issue of the Deutsche medizinische Wochenschri f t , an article by Dr. Theodor Aschenbrandt about experiments performed on Bavarian soldiers during the fall maneuvers . The article was called The Physiological Effectand Importance of Cocaine . Certain phrases jumped out of the page at him : " . . . suppression of hunger . . . increase of the capacity to endurestrain . . . increase of all mental powers . " Dr. Aschenbrandt reportedon six cases . Sigmund found himself reading with intense interest : " On the second day of the march , it was a very hot day , the soldier T. collapsed from exhaustion . I gave him a tablespoonful of water containing twenty drops of cocaine muriaticum ( 0,5:10 ) . About five minutes later T. got up by himself , continued the march for several kilometers to the point of destination ; in spite of a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good shape on arrival . " He read through the next five cases , asking the key questions and searching for answers . Did this renewed energy on the part of the soldiers come out of their own reservoir of strength ? Or had the twenty drops of cocaine created a totally new strength ? What were the properties in cocaine that created the endurance ? WALK A FINE LINE I29There flashed into his mind an article he had read in the Detroit TherapeuticGazette a month or so before on the same subject . He went down to the reading room , found the Gazette in an elongated row of magazines and took it to his room for study . He then glanced at his watch on the desk before him and saw that there was still time to get over to the library of the Surgeon General 's office . In the Index Catalogue he found an article , Erythroxylum coca , which contained a bibliography of the literature on the drug . He made his way back to the physiology laboratory . Ernst Fleischl gave him an introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical library , and wrote a note assuming responsibility for any books Dr. Freud might use . The evidence , when put together from a dozen sources , was staggering . " In fact , " Sigmund thought , " it strains one 's credulity . " In a series of articlesfrom Lima , Peru , stories were told of how the Indians used coca as a stimulant from early youth and continued to use it throughout their lives without harmful effect ; they employed it when they were facing a difficult journey ; when they were taking a woman . When their strength was going to be called on for great and continued exertion they increased their customary dosage . Valdez y Palacios maintained that " by using coca the Indians are able to travel on foot for hundreds of hours and run faster than horses without showing signs of fatigue . " Tschudi 's articles cited a case in which a half-breed had been able to work at the hard manual labor of excavation for five days and nights without sleeping for more than two hours a night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to equatorial countries this was a generally known fact . There were reports that if taken in excessive amounts cocaine could lead to digestive complaints , or emaciation , depravity and apathy ; in fact many of the symptoms were similar to alcoholism and morphine addiction . However no such case was reported where the drug had been taken in moderation . What fascinated Sigmund even more were the reports , as early as 1787 , of the beneficent effects of coca on psychiatric patients . Antonio Julian , a Jesuit , reported on a learned missionary who had been freed from severe hypochondria ; Mantegazza claimed that coca was universally effective in helping the functional disorders of neurasthenia ; Fliessburg wrote that cases of nervous prostration could be considerably improved by the use of coca ; and Caldwell , in the Detroit Therapeutic Gazette , attested to its effectiveness as a tonic for hysteria . The Italians Morselli and Buccolahad tested the drug with a group of melancholics under their care , using subcutaneous injection , and reported " improvement in . . . their patients , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if coca could not help fill the gap in the Allge-130 WALK A FINE LINEmeine Krankenhaus ' psychiatric medicine chest . While he had cared for the patients under Meynert , he had had a good supply of drugs for reducingthe excitation of nerve centers but neither he nor anyone else had had any drug which could improve the reduced functioning of the nerve centers . As he sat in the library of the Gesellschaft der Arzte reading the articles he added up the evidence that coca had been effective not only in hysteria and melancholia but for hypochondria , inhibition , stupor , anxiety , fear . And if all this were true , surely there must be other valuable uses for the drug which no one had touched on ? How was he to verify this material ? Would Professor Meynert allow him to test it on the patients in the psychiatric ward or Professor Scholz allow him to give it to the patientssuffering from nervous diseases ? The drug , as he learned by walking over to Haubner 's Engelapotheke am Hof , was very expensive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patients ; ProfessorScholz would not buy one kreutzer 's worth . Obviously if he were going to test it he would have to be his own patient , test tube and treasurer . He wrote to Merck 's in Darmstadt , who had provided Aschenbrandt with the coca for his experiments , ordering samples . His tutoring fees from two students just covered the cost . When it arrived in the mail he let it sit on his table until he was suffering a slight depression brought on by fatigue . He mixed o.05 gram of the cocainum muriaticum in a one percent water solution and drank it down . He then stretched out on the bed fully clothed to see what would happen . After a few moments he experienced an exhilaration and feeling of ease , of lightness . He got up , went to his desk . There was a certain furriness of his lips and palate followed by a feeling of warmth . He tried a glass of cold water which was warm on his lips yet cold in his throat . He jotted down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses is due not so much to direct stimulation as to the disappearance of elements in one 's general state of well-being which cause depression , " During the hours that passed he was stimulated to such an extent that it would have been impossible for him to sleep . He felt neither hunger nor fatigue but a desire for an intense intellectual effort . He picked up some of his more technical books and began to analyze the abstruse material . He worked for a number of hours with clarity and spirit ; then slowly the drug wore off . He glanced at his watch , saw that it was two o'clock in the morning . He undressed , washed his hands and face , went to bed and fell asleep . He awoke promptly at seven feeling no sense of fatigue , got up and went to the desk to look at the volume of handwritten pages and the amount of text he had absorbed . WALK A PINE LINE 131 " Is this the effect of the coca ? " he asked himself . " Or could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was feeling depressed , could he have forced himself to sit down and work in the first place ? During the following weeks he tried the same dosage of cocaine a num- ber of times . Not once did it fail him . He wrote that through the coca he achieved " exhilaration and lasting euphoria , which does not differ in any way from the normal euphoria of a healthy person . " He could perceive an increase of self-control , vitality and capacity for work ; it was difficult for him to believe that he was under the influence of a drug . He performed intensive mental labors without fatigue ; ate well but had the clear impression that the meal was not required . He had no craving for further use of cocaine ; rather he felt a certain unmotivated aversion to it . After a dozen experiments he decided to take the result to Josef Breuer . Breuer was working in his upstairs laboratory . On learning what Sigmund had been doing , he set his work aside . When Sigmund finished reporting he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might try this on Fleischl ? I 've brought accounts from a number of cases where people have been broken of morphine by the use of coca . " " What have you told Fleischl about this ? " " Nothing . He knows about my reading because he gave me a letter of introduction to the Gesellschaft der Arzte . I have not told him about my experiments . " Josef squinted his eyes as though to see through to a truth , then shook his head a little apprehensively . " What about cocaine addiction ? " " The Peruvian Indians use it all their lives . That 's addiction but it does n't appear to have done them any harm . Ernst is constantly increasing his morphine dosage . Is n't it worth a try ? " They found Fleischl in total torment , his eyes bloodshot , his arm twitch- ing with pain . Sigmund recounted the coca experience . Fleischl was en- thusiastic . Sigmund put 0.05 gram into a glass of water . Fleischl drank it . They sat quietly in the study . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . His eyes cleared , he raised his head , began striding around the room . " Sig , Sig , I think you 've found it . I think it 's going to work . I know I 'm taking too much morphine but I ca n't control myself when this thing festers . " Josef Breuer said , " We know what you 're suffering , Ernst . But the coca has only been partially tested . We must use great discretion . " " I 'll do what you tell me , Josef . Sig , can you get it for me ? " 132 WALK A PINE LINE " Yes , I 've already talked to the manager at Haubner 's . It 's only a little more expensive than sending to Merck . " Once a day Sigmund , Breuer or another friend of Fleischl 's , Dr. HeinrichObersteiner , manager of a mental sanatorium in Oberdobling , gave Ernst his portion of coca , in every instance holding it to the 0.05 level . When they were afraid to give him any after dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleischl cried : " What does it matter ? This way I feel well , I can read and work on my experiments and do some writing . The other way I am in misery and do n't sleep anyway . " It took only one week for the roof to cave in . Sigmund climbed the flight of stairs and knocked on the door of Fleischl 's apartment late of an afternoon but got no answer . He kept knocking . There was a sound insidethe apartment which he could not identify . He ran to the physiology laboratory for help . Exner came back with him . Josef Breuer and Obersteinerwere both summoned . When they managed to break into the room they found Fleischl lying on the floor semiconscious . They undressed him and put him into a warm bath . He came to slowly . Both he and his friends were shattered by the experience . Sigmund would not leave before he had secured a master key to the apartment . He gave it to Obersteiner , who agreed that he would come walked home at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wurstelmann behind his stand and ate hungrily , suddenly remembering they had had no supper . Ahead of them the lamplighterin his hat with the long peak and Zundstongen , extendible pole , was opening the glass doors of the lamps and turning off the gas . The Am Hof market was already going full force , the early shoppers commandeeringthe best produce while the country women drank hot tea to keep warm . A man with a box carriage on small wheels , a ladder and bucket of paint hanging behind him , passed on his way to paint posters on a wall . The crew of street cleaners , their horse-drawn water barrels tilted downward , were sprinkling the streets from the opened plugs . Groups of elegantly dressed men in high silk hats and capes came out of the brilliantlylighted cafes to yawn their cheery good nights . " I 'm uneasy , " persisted Breuer . " He should n't have been in that conditionfrom pain . . . . Has he been getting any extra coca ? I mean from Haubner 's ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The news was bad . Fleischl had been buying a large quantity of coca and taking it surreptitiously . Was coca then as safe as the literature made it sound ? What constituted an overdose ? Obviously there were dangers . WALK A PINE LINE 133He made no attempt to keep his experiment secret . He revealed his findings to his colleagues , some of whom tried the drug and brought him corroborative reports that it was the equivalent of an ample meal , that it dispelled extreme fatigue or roused sufficient strength to take a long walk . Josef Pollak reported the successful use of the drug on the control of the mucus membrane and muscular system of the stomach . After his scare , Fleischl cut down on the coca . Sigmund himself continued to take the prescribed dosage whenever he felt he needed it , gave some to his sister Rosa and sent some to Martha , who found that it helped her during periods of stress . Breuer was still cautious but Sigmund 's faith in the cocaine was renewed . He found reason to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as deaden the pain of trachoma and cutaneous infections . He gave some to his friends Karl Koller and Dr. Leopold Konigstein , suggesting that they use coca to lessen the pain of non-operable eye ailments . When he had all his materials assembled he wrote a twenty-six-page paper On Coca which was published in the Centralblatt fur die gesammte T herapie in which he collated the published materials he had found in five languages , quoted his authorities and then set forth with enthusiasm the case for the value of the drug in digestive disorders , dyspepsia , anemia , febrile diseases , syphilis , the control of morphine and alcohol addiction , impotence . . If even half of this amazing potential should be realized , his name and fame would be made . He wrote to Martha : " We need no more than one stroke of luck of this kind to consider settingup house . " Ignaz Schonberg 's mother developed a complicated heart ailment . Sigmundgave up his spare hours at the hospital to care for her . He brought her back to health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment over the fact that his brothers had not paid Dr. Freud 's token charges . When at length the money arrived , sixty gulden , Sigmund bought an electric massage machine he would need for his privatepatients , then arranged to send ten gulden to Martha so that she could buy herself a jersey jacket she had been wanting. 7  --  The summer heat of 1884 clamped down on Vienna and the streets emptied of Viennese as the carts and wagons moved the families to the country . Sigmund went to the barber , had his hair cut quite short , the dark beard trimmed to a thin line , and even ordered a lightweight suit to be made by Tischer , the tailor who served most of the young doctors134 WALK A PINE LINEat the Krankenhaus . It was over a year since Mrs. Bernays had taken her two daughters back to Germany . Breuer offered Sigmund a patient suffering from a severe neurosis who would pay the Herr Doktor one thousand gulden if he would spend the summer traveling with him . His colleagues urged him to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a male nurse to a lunatic . Besides , he needed the months to complete his work in Meynert 's laboratory and his investigation of coca . It was Primarius Scholz who went on vacation . He left Dr. Josef Pollak and Dr. Moriz Ullmann , who had been assigned to the Fourth Departmentshortly after Sigmund arrived there , in charge . When a serious outbreak of cholera occurred in Montenegro , the news spread through the Krankenhaus that doctors were sorely needed . Pollak and Ullmann heard of it instantly , volunteered , then went together to Sigmund 's room . They caught him writing furiously about his experiments in measuring muscle reactions under the influence of coca . Pollak , hard-working and serious in the wards , liked to create fun when he could close the doors behind him . He stood before Sigmund , clicked his heels together ceremoniously , bowed low , exclaimed : " Herr Doktor Primarius Professor Freud , we have come to congratulate you . You have just been promoted by the Minister of Education to become superintendent of the Fourth Medical Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was accustomed to Pollak 's pranks but could make no sense of this one . " When did this great honor befall me , gentlemen ? " Ullmann broke in with a grin . " It happened to you ten minutes ago . And we are the ones who brought this distinguished honor upon you . " " Come on , you two clowns , what is this all about ? " " It 's no joke , Sig , " said Pollak . " Ullmann and I have volunteered to go to Montenegro . There is a cholera epidemic there . They need every doctorVienna can spare . " " Good , I 'll join you . " " You ca n't , Herr Hofrat , " cried Pollak . " You have to mind the store . There is absolutely no one to take your place . We 'll bring you back some souvenirs . " As acting chief of the Fourth Medical Department he grew up fast . Prior to this time he had had patients to take care of but the final responsibilityrested with either Scholz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for the admitting of patients , their diagnosis and treatment , but for the uses of the money available for supplies , drugs and equipment . Excitedly walking the wards as the Primarius , he mused : WALK A FINE LINE i35 " This is the first time I 've really known what it means to be a hospital doctor . " There were life-and-death decisions to be made every few minutes . To admit this patient and reject that one . To send a third patient home because there was still another more in need of hospitalization . He commandedone hundred and thirteen beds , but there were times when five hundred patients were trying to get into them . . . with variations of trauma , seizures , tumors , as well as motor and spinal paralysis . The beds were no longer the exact distance from each other that the regulations and Herr Dr. Scholz demanded . Sometimes he did not get to bed until three in the morning . As a lowly Junior Sekundararzt he had been allowed to sleep until seven o'clock . As Primarius he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought flashed through his mind : " Josef Breuer and Nathan Weiss were right . Herr Dr. Freud , you are at long last becoming a neurologist . " Primarius Scholz returned at the end of August , freeing Sigmund for a vacation , a long-hoped-for visit with Martha . She met him at the railroad station in Hamburg , waving to him as she ran down the platform against the flow of disembarking passengers . He set down his valise , waited until she was in his arms , then whispered against her ear : " I wrote you not to meet me at the station unless you were prepared to be kissed in public . " " I could n't let you come into Hamburg and not be welcomed . " " Martha , Martha , how good to hear your voice again ! " She had engaged a carriage to take them to Wandsbek , some five miles from Hamburg ; the driver watched for them to emerge from the station . They sat locked in each other 's arms against the leather button-studded back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man 's life , and out of a young woman 's . He held her away from him , studying her face . It was a little slimmer than he remembered ; her eyes were radiant with the joy of being with him again . She still parted her hair in the centerand had obeyed his instructions to take a long walk every day . She was wearing a silk summer dress . His old gray suit and white shirt were rumpledfrom the journey and the black soot of the giant engine . " Was it a good trip ? I 've been counting every hour since you left Vi-enna . " " You know how crazy I am about trains , just like Alexander . Did you find me a room ? " " Yes , but not the attic you asked for . Some friends on the Kedenburgstrassehad a front room to spare . You 'll like it , it overlooks the Eichtalpark . The month 's rent is not high . " 136 WALK A PINE LINE " You 're a bright girl . " Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to was hung with cream-colored wallpaper with a pattern of yellow daisies . Martha waited in the parlor while he washed , changed his shirt and put on his new suit , then they walked the short block to the house Mrs. Bernays had rented on the Steinpilzweg . It was a modest cottage set in a garden , on a quiet street , and furnished with furniture Sigmund remembered from the apartment in Vienna , including the comfortable brown chair and hassock in which he and Martha had spent happy hours . Sigmund had not looked forward with any pleasure to meeting Mrs. Bernays again . But when he entered the house he saw that she was thin and haggard from a long illness . All antipathy fled ; in its place came remorseand sympathy . He stepped forward , said , " Grass Gott . It 's good to see you again , Mother , " bent over and kissed her hand . He asked how she felt , then said solicitously : " You must let me prescribe a special tonic and watch over you while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a reasonably good doctor . " Mrs. Bernays too had been braced for a chilly meeting , perhaps even a contest . Sigmund 's interest in her well-being vanquished her opposition . " That I never doubted , " she replied , with more tenderness than he had ever heard in her voice . " My only worry was how long it would take you . I know that your friend Dr. Ernst Fleischl has been engaged to the same poor girl for ten years , or is it twelve ? But I also know now how deeply Martha loves you . Let us be allies , Sigi . " When she left the room , Martha leaned forward and kissed him on the forehead . " Thank you . You see now how right I was to keep the family peace ? An argument not waged is a war won . " " Agreed , Fraulein Aristotle . Your logic is impeccable . " Minna came in , her broad face wreathed in a smile as she engulfed the smaller Sigmund in a bear hug . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now quickly tell me about my Ignaz . Have you had letters from Oxford ? He never tells me how he feels . Is he thriving on the work . . . ? " " Whoa , whoa , little sister , you must n't drive me like an Einspanner . You will have the news of our Ignaz . He is working well on the dictionary . Before long he should be earning the three thousand gulden a year needed for you to marry . " Minna waltzed around the parlor and ended by taking both Martha and Sigmund in her capacious arms and kissing them lustily on the cheek . In the early mornings they walked in the woods surrounding Wandsbek , with the dew still fresh on the grass , the September sunshine warm as it filtered through the network of trees . Martha wore a loose-fittingWALK A PINE LINE 137brown walking dress and a big hat . Sigmund declared , " These greens here are so all-pervading your eyes look like emeralds . The Prater is a paradise but there were never less than a hundred people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wandsbek grove is more beautiful because we are alone , like Adam and Eve . . . . " They chatted quietly about their future . At eleven o'clock they would stop for the Fruhstiick at a small inn , the tables out under the trees . While this was no Viennese " fork breakfast " of goulash , a waitress brought them fresh-baked bread , sweet butter , cakes and milk . Then they walked home , stopping to pick the last of the wild flowers , to midday dinner cooked by Mrs. Bernays and Minna , who had decreed that Martha was to do no housework for the month of September " as long as Sigi is here . " Of a late afternoon they rode the horse-drawn streetcar into Hamburg to buy the shirts that Jakob had said were better than the Vienna shirts ; or to gaze , doe-eyed , into the window of the furniture stores with their displays of mahogany dining-room sets , armchairs and sofas for the parlor , bedroom suites with high headboards and carved footboards . The Hamburg furniture was more stolid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is built to last several generations , " he remarked . " Oh , it is , " she replied emphatically . " Hamburg families buy one house , then furnish it to last a century . " " When I went to the Electrical Exhibition in Vienna last year there was a series of rooms , lighted by electricity of course , but furnished charminglyby Jaray 's furniture store . I was in ecstasy thinking how much you would have enjoyed seeing those beautiful things . Then I realized that we could be unhappy on a Jaray 's lovely sofa , and happy in any wellusedarmchair . The wife should always be the most beautiful ornament in the house . " She gazed at his reflection in the store window . " Sigi , you think you are a scientist of the breed that believes only what it can measure . Not so , my dear . You are a poet . " Toward the middle of the month there were two days of rain . They sat cozily in the Bernays parlor reading aloud to each other from Heine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sigmund rested after the hard-working year in the wards and laboratories of the Krankenhaus . He enjoyed every moment with Martha and the Bernays family . They spent a full day walking the busy docks and canals of Hamburg . He told her of the offer he had received to accompany Breuer 's sick patient abroad . " A thousand-gulden fee is a big one . You could have used the money in a dozen directions , " she exclaimed 138 WALK A PINE LINE " Yes , but it would have held up my work for three months , and held back our marriage for the same length of time . " " I am hindering you , " she said . He took her by the shoulders and shook her . " My beloved girl , you must utterly banish from your mind such gloomy thoughts . You know the key to my life : I can work only when spurred on by great hopes for things uppermost in my mind . Before I met you I did n't know the joy of living and now that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one condition I make to life , which I otherwisedo n't set any great store by . I am very stubborn and very reckless and need great challenges . I have done a number of things which any sensible person would be bound to consider very rash . For example , to take up science as a poverty-stricken man , then as a poverty-stricken man to capture a poor girl ; but this must continue to be my way of life : riskinga lot , hoping a lot , working a lot . To average bourgeois common sense I was lost long ago . " There were tears in her eyes as she linked her arm through his . Eventually he came around to telling her of the travel grant given by the Medical Faculty . The fund had been started by the rector and Consistoriumof the university in 1866 . " It 's for six hundred gulden , two hundred and forty dollars , " he explained , " and it goes to the Sekundararzt at the Krankenhaus whom the Medical Faculty considers can benefit most from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , study under a master in your field . The winning of the grant is like an honorary degree . " " Oh , Sigi , do you think there is a chance for you ? " " It 's only a matter of rumor . If I win I want to go to Paris and study at the Salpetril re under Professor Charcot . He practically invented modernneurology singlehanded . " He looked at her apprehensively . " It would mean that I must spend one more year of training at the Krankenhaus , then I could come here to visit with you for a vacation , and after that go to Paris . " Martha closed her eyes , rested her chin on her folded hands as though she were praying . " What a beautiful dream . May it come true . " 8 . The first person Sigmund saw when he came through the court of the Fourth Department on his return from Wandsbek was Dr. Karl Koller . Koller , twenty-seven , was practically the only clean-shaven man in the hospital ; his hair was cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woreWALK A PINE LINE 139a little curl combed forward . His only nod to convention was a long , thin mustache whose ends turned up in straggly fashion . He had an open goodnaturedface with well-proportioned features but there was a difference between Koller 's genial face and his personality , which was abrasive . He was irritable , blunt , fault-finding . " Karl , what are you doing up here policing my area ? Have we suddenly taken over Ophthalmology ? " Koller cried , " No , Ophthalmology has taken over you . " Sigmund took off his coat and shoes , put on a pair of slippers . Koller circled the furniture . " Sig , I owe it all to you . You remember how you demonstrated the effects of cocaine to us and gave us each a little . You commented on the numbness it caused in the mouth . Well , I was in Professor Stricker 's lab and I had a small flask with a trace of white powder in my pocket . I showed it to the professor and his Assistant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed I expect , that this powder will anesthetize the eye . ' Stricker asked , When ? ' I replied , Any time that I want to start the experiment . ' Gartner said , What 's the matter with right now ? ' He got me a big lively frog and held him immobile while I dissolved the coca in water and trickled drops of the solution into one of the protruding eyes . We tested the reflex of the cornea with a needle . Sig , I swear to you it was only an instant before the great moment came : the frog permitted the cornea to be touched and even injured without a trace of reflex action or attempt to protect himself . You can imagine how excited we were . We promptly got a rabbit and a dog and trickled cocaine into one eye . We were able to do anything to it with a needle and a knife without causing the animal pain . " Sigmund sat staring at his friend . " My God , yes , of course , Karl . If cocaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Our next problem was the human being . We did n't dare test it on any patient in the wards , so we trickled a solution under the lid of each other 's eye .

' Sig , would you believe it , we could make a dent in the cornea without the slightest awareness of the touch ? Do you realize what this means ? We can now operate for glaucoma and cataracts without inflicting pain on the patient , and at the same time keep him quiet until our task is completed ! " Sigmund jumped up and embraced Koller . " You 've made a breakthrough . You must set down your findings and lecture to the Society of Medicine , then publish the paper .
