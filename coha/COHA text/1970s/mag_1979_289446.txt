Supplies are down , tempers are up , and gas station lines come back <P> <P> Pulling into a service station is beginning to seem like entering a combat zone . With more and more of the nation 's 171,000 gas stations closing on weekends , shortening hours during the week , and cutting sales to $5 per customer to stretch supplies , frazzled and angry drivers are starting to boil over . <P> In Las Vegas , only ten of the city 's more than 200 stations were open a week ago Sunday when scuffles and fistfights broke out at several of them as fuming vacationers waited for gasoline in lines that sometimes stretched for blocks . In California , where drivers are now lining up before dawn and service station operators grant appointments like doctors , a customer at a San Francisco self-service pump jumped to the head of the queue , then stabbed a man in line behind him who tried to protest . In Miami , some drivers tank up and roar off without paying when attendants turn their backs . <P> Tempers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already forced nearly all oil companies to allocate deliveries to their retail outlets on a monthly basis , usually 90% or 95% of what the stations sold during the same month of 1978 . Last week Texaco , Sun oil , Union and Exxon tightened their allocations still further , in the case of Exxon to 80% of the 1978 level . Thus , as summer progresses , drivers will find it increasingly difficult to buy gas toward the end of each month as service stations run dry . <P> Warnings of a gasoline squeeze have been voiced repeatedly since last winter by everyone from oil executives to Jimmy Carter and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger , all of whom have urged the public to curb its driving and start conserving fuel . No one has paid much attention , and people seem instead to grow more convinced by the day that the shortages are part of a price-gouging hoax perpetrated by Big Oil . <P> The real and immediate reason why supplies are tight is that overall output by the 13-nation OPEC cartel , which produces nearly half the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% since December , when shipments from Iran first stopped . Now that Iran is back to exporting , at two-thirds normal capacity , Saudi Arabia , Libya , Kuwait and other oil states are reducing their own deliveries to keep the market tight . <P> Supplies are also being crimped because demand for petroleum continues to grow . Last year 's momentary surplus brought on by increased output from the North Sea and Alaska has been more than wiped out by rising consumption as well as OPEC 's cutbacks . Steadily growing consumption of gasoline is causing most of the demand problem . Nearly 40% of all oil used in the U.S. goes for gasoline , and even though the price has almost doubled since 1973 , the nation 's 142 million motorists are burning it in record amounts . Not only have over 20 million new drivers streamed onto highways since 1973 , but so have 24 million additional cars , trucks , campers , vans , Jeeps , dune buggies and other such toys for grownups . <P>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
