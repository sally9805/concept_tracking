txt Richard J. Herrin was convicted today of manslaughter in the hammer-bludgeoning last year of his former girlfriend , Bonnie Joan Garland . Immediately after the verdict , Judge Richard J. Daronco of County Court revoiced the $50,000 bail on which the Yale University graduate had been free since last Aug. 10 and sent him to Westchester County jail pending sentencing on July 25 . Mr. Herrin faces a prison term of eight to 25 years . The 24-year-old defendant was motionless when the verdict of the jury of eight men and four women was announced by the jury foreman , Patricia Policriti . In the second row of the courtroom sat Paul and Joan Garland , the parents of the victim . His face was contorted and Mrs. Garland wept as the verdict was read Fourth Day of Deliberations Later , outside the 14th-floor courtroom , Mr. Garland struggled for control of his voice as he termed the verdict an " injustice . " He added that Mr. Herrin had received " special treatment " in not being convicted of the second-degree murder charge , which caries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jury 's verdict of first-degree manslaughter came at 12:30 P.M. , in the middle of its fourth day of deliberations , during which it returned to the courtroom four times to hear the rereading of complex testimony by defense and prosecution psychiatrists . The difficulty of the jurors ' deliberations was highlighted in Judge Daronco 's charge to them last Thursday in which he noted the defense 's two-pronged argument of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect or guilty of the reduced charge of manslaughter due to extreme emotional disturbance . There were , the judge said , four possi // ble verdicts in the case : guilty of seconddegree murder as charged , not guilty , not guilty by reason of temporary mental defect or disease or guilty of the first-degree manslaughter charge Through the 12 days of testimony , the assistant district attorney , William Fred -- reek , and the defense attorney , Jack Litman , brought 29 witnesses in all to the witness stand . Throughout the case the activity outside the courtroom has been just as dramatic as that going on inside , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his supporters becoming objects of competing , and seemingly contradictory , emotions of sympathy . The case , involving a romance between . Mr. Herrin of Los Angeles , who was at . Yale University on a scholarship , and the daughter of a well-to-do Scarsdale family , - awakened strong emotions in both Scarsdale and on the Yale campus , The Garland family , which has memorialized ' Miss Garland with the establishment or a scholarship fund , has actively protested since the July 7 , 1977 , killing , that the ? court was too lenient in allowing bail ? and that elements of the Yale community had exhibited an unkind and uneven compassion in rushing to Mr. Herrin 's defense . Supporters of the Defendant The feelings ran just as deep among supporters and friends of the defendant , most of whom were affiliated with the St. Thomas More House , the Catholic par-. ish situated on , but not affiliated with , the Yale campus . An effort led by the assistant chaplain of More House , Sister Ramona Pena , raised not only bail money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but more than $30t000 in defense funds . The Garland family 's protests to the Yale administration , the court and Cardin nal Terence Cooke , led to considerable debate on the Yale campus , to Mr. Garland 's severing of his ties as an active alumnus at the school , and the subsequent expulsion of the defendant from parttime studies at a state university branch : Through much of this the defense supt porters have kept silent , saying only ' that these efforts were " a personal and private involvement . Their silence turned to uncontrolled sobbing today when the verdict was read and the defendant was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs . Judge Dronco , in granting the motion for revocation of bail , noted that the defendant , once " innocent in the eyes of the court , " was now a convicted felon . He rejected Mr. Litman 's contention that Mr. Herrin , who had always conceeded that he had killed Miss Garland , had been " no danger to the community " while out on bail and would continue-to observe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last opportunity for the defendant to say goodbye to his family and friends , the judge said no and angrily retorted : " Do n't try to pull on my heartstrings . " The Yale Issue Mr. Garland said that since his daughter 's death , the issue in the case had , always been whether " someone with a Yale education and a $30,000 smoke- ; screen fund " would receive the same , treatment as someone without those things . " The verdict indicates that the smokescreen was too thick for a well-meaning jury , " he said . " What remains is a cold , calculated , cowardly , middle-of-the-night murder of a young girl in her bed . " The indictment of Mr. Herrin alleged ' that he hit Miss Garland with a clawhammer several times while she slept in her family 's home , causing a fracture or her skull and larynx . In the trial , the defendant maintained ' that he also intended committing suicide and to that end fled in the Garland family car , driving aimlessly as he contemplated various methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wound up sitting on the steps of a Catholic church in Coxsackie , N.Y .. where he is said to have confessed to a priest and later to the Coxsackie police . who returned him to Scarsdale the evening after the slaying.
