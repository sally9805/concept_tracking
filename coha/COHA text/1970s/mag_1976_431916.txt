 | THE MEMORY MACHINE @# @# We ' re now about to engage in a bit of name-dropping . The name we 're going to drop is that of the late John O'Hara , a novelist who wrote books about several things but mostly about girls being seduced in Locomobiles and Pierce-Arrows in the Pennsylvania Dutch country . These girls almost always got married and everybody in Gibbsville , Pennsylvania ( a town invented by O'Hara ) , kept a perfectly straight face when the charmers walked down the aisle in virgin white . Later these same girls frequently went to the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia and violated the Seventh Commandment of Moses . Their husbands were in New York shacked up with models , chorus girls , or sometimes with divorcees who had chewed their marriage vows , found them to be bitter fruit , and had spat them out . Married or unmarried , the inhabitants of Gibbsville really got around . When I drop the name of John O'Hara , I want to do it gently , because I do n't want to bruise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he borrowed money from me steadily ( eventually he always paid it back ) and once threatened to sock me on the jaw in a speakeasy because I delivered a casual opinion that John Steinbeck was a better writer than Ernest Hemingway . I do n't think O'Hara liked me , because I was passing through a phase when I had contempt for fiction and fiction writers , and John was passionately determined to be a novelist . I was all for Emil Ludwig 's biography of Napoleon and Oswald Spengler 's Decline of the West . Why should anybody waste time reading or writing fiction when all you had to do was invest twenty-five cents at a secondhand book store and come out with a copy of Dickens ' Tale of Two Cities or Melville 's Moby Dick ? Enough fiction had already been written to last everybody for all time . Let 's cut out the nonsense and proceed to important matters . This infuriated O'Hara , and he said he would ram those words down my throat someday because the Great American Novel remained to be written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met purely through a coincidence of our romantic pursuits in New York in the late twenties and early thirties . Two blonds shared an apartment on East 34th Street . One of them was named  | Katherine Klinkenberg , a Viking who was five feet seven inches tall and one of the most stunning females I have ever had the pleasure of gazing upon . O'Hara was her slave . Klink worked for Time magazine and I think John did too at that point , although he would never admit it to me and he would n't let Klink discuss the matter . When you asked him what he was doing , he replied : " I 'm a novelist . " John had unlimited contempt for journalism . I once accused him of having a job on the New York Herald-Tribune . His Irish eyes turned icy and he said : " Well , if I do an occasional chore for Walker , it 's none of your business , is it ? " Walker was Stanley Walker , city editor of the Herald-Tribune . He had a knack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at eighteen dollars a week ) and getting maximum production out of them by playing organ music on their egos . At its peak , the Herald-Tribune was the best newspaper I have ever read ? Walter Lippmann , dramatic critic Percy Hammond , music critic Lawrence Gilman , sports editor Stanley Woodward , who could make a football story funny and dramatic at the same time , the wry observations of sports columnist Red Smith , but , above all , the expert reporting of day-to-day events in New York City under the sure and steady hand of Stanley Walker . I never saw O'Hara 's name on a story , and I suspect he was a precinct police reporter and hating every minute of it . The Herald-Tribune sank for economic reasons , and I suppose the moral of the story is that you are a sucker to try to sell quality merchandise to people who prefer shoddy products . If you disagree , you are invited to interview the board of directors of Rolls-Royce Ltd. about their money problems . I 'm sure O'Hara did n't affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may have been fired for writing short stories on company time on company typewriters and com pany paper , instead of hustling out to get the facts about the latest homicide on the Lower East Side . The other blond in the East 34th Street apartment was not quite a match for Klink in looks , but she could easily have made the front row of the chorus line in George White 's Scandals , had she been disposed to shed most of her clothing and learn to tap dance . Instead , she went down to Macy 's five days a week and " coordinated " something in the women 's fashion racket . Her first name was Elizabeth , and that will be all the iden-@# tification she shall receive here because she threw me over for a stockbroker who worked for Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane , as it was known in those days . Later , I believe , a Beane dropped out and a Smith crept in , but no matter . This guy had an expense account and would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to sell her something , although not necessarily stocks and bonds . Anyway , he had better luck than I did . @# Around 11 o'clock one night , Elizabeth and I walked into the apartment after a frugal dinner in an Italian restaurant . Klink was sitting in an overstuffed chair . O'Hara was sitting on the floor cradling a pint milk bottle which I subsequently learned was filled with bathtub gin . Klink performed the introductions . I was offered and accepted the milk bottle , and O'Hara asked : " What do you do for a living ? " " I work for the United Press . What do you do for a living ? " " I 'm a novelist . Why do n't you write novels instead of wasting your time in the news business ? " " Why do n't you spend all your time and energy in writing novels and stop wasting your time minding other people 's business ? " Klink ordered us to cut it out under the threat of instant eviction . The pint milk bottle made the rounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say three-way because Elizabeth sat in silence . Physically she was in the room . Mentally and spiritually she was far away ? maybe ordering a shrimp cocktail at " 21 " ; maybe looking at the big board in the Manhattan headquarters of Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane . One thing for sure : she was n't listening to me or looking at me . Or at O'Hara or Klink . Shortly after . midnight Klink adjourned the meeting . She gave O'Hara a kiss on the cheek and gave me a pat on the head . Elizabeth did n't give anybody anything , not even a murmur of thanks for the lasagna and red wine I had bought for her . She disappeared in the general direction of the bedrooms and paused only long enough to toss this remark at me : " See you later , alligator . " At the time I thought this was an immensely clever remark , but later I learned she had stolen it from a radio program for teen-agers . O'Hara told me . John and I walked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch the Lexington Avenue subway to get to my Greenwich Village apartment on Bank Street . I do n't know where O'Hara wanted to go , but it did n't make any difference . At Second Avenue he gripped my  | right arm and led me up a flight of stairs into a speakeasy . " Good morning , Mr. O'Hara , " the bartender said . " What will it be ? " " Rye on the rocks , and my friend will pay . " I paid and paid , because O'Hara turned his pockets inside out to demonstrate to me that he had no money . It was the first of several times I financed O'Hara 's addiction to Old Overholt , bootleg style , but as I said previously , he always paid me back , and usually with witty notes accompanying the money . Financially , it was a costly night , but I do not regret it , because for the first time I saw the incredible O'Hara Memory Machine in action . There were four other men in the bar , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them kept yelling , " All right , name the infield , name the infield ; five bucks says you ca n't do it . " It developed they were talking about the Chicago Black Sox , who had thrown the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds . The man placed a five-dollar bill on the bar and said , " Name the infield , five bucks says nobody in this room can name the infield . " " I 'll take it , " O'Hara said , and asked me for a loan of five dollars . So there was ten dollars on the bar and tension in the air . O'Hara knocked back a shot of rye and spoke : " First base , Chick Gandil . Second base , Eddie Collins . Shortstop , Swede Risberg . Third base , Buck Weaver . " The bartender , in his role as umpire , consulted a book and pushed the ten dollars over to O'Hara . There was a long silence which John broke by ordering two Old Overholts on the rocks and pocketing the change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some respect , but he still wanted to get his money back . " For another five , " he said , " would you like to try to name two outfielders , two pitchers , and the catcher ? " " Make it ten , " O'Hara said , putting the bite on me for another five . " Five 's enough , " the man said , and I quickly grabbed my five dollars off the bar . O'Hara was in seventh heaven , and he savored every moment of it . He arranged the two fivedollar bills neatly on the bar , took a long , slow drink , and kept his adversary in suspense . " Two outfielders , two pitchers , and the catcher is what you want . Right ? " " Right , " said the man , " and I want them pretty soon . " " Okay , outfielders , Hap Felsch and Shoeless Joe 74 Jackson . Pitchers , Eddie Cicotte and Dickie Kerr . Catcher , Ray Schalk . " Once more ten dollars moved into O'Hara 's possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the bartender announced the place was closing , one of them yelled at John : " I bet you was born and raised in Chicago , was n't you ? You know so damn much about the Black Sox . " " Nope , " was the reply . " Pennsylvania . I 'm a Philadelphia Athletics fan and a cousin fourth removed to Mister Connie Mack , their manager . " " That 's a lie , " I said . " You are n't related to Connie Mack . " " Truth forever on the scaffold , wrong forever on the throne , " said O'Hara . " Ten dollars says you do n't know who wrote that . " I got in a taxicab and went home . @# So far as I know , O'Hara never bet on a horse race , never played poker , and never shot dice . There is considerable risk in those activities , and he preferred a sure thing . But more important , he cared nothing about gambling . He invented intellectual games , and whether you won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he out to make a financial killing ; the stakes were always small . What O'Hara was really looking for was little things that would inflate his ego , and he took particular delight in beating a specialist at his own game . John found such a man one evening in a saloon : Ward Morehouse , a theater columnist for the New York Sun , a formidable opponent indeed . Morehouse was the best-informed reporter on theatrical affairs along Broadway , and had many and lasting friendships among actors . The three of us sat at a table and O'Hara allowed time for adequate lubrication . Then he sprang it on Morehouse : " Tell you what . You write down five names of famous actors and I 'll write down five . Then each of us will write in the year the actor was born . Whoever comes closest to the year of birth wins . A one-dollar bet on each actor . The bartender has a World Almanac , and it will be the final authority . " " I 'll take it , " Morehouse said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I compiled two master lists of ten names and borrowed the World Almanac . It took about ten minutes for each of them to finish , and the two slips showed the following results : O'Hara won Maurice Chevalier , 1888 ; Mary Astor , 1906 ; Bette Davis , 1908 ; Janet Gaynor , 1906 : George Raft , 1895.  | Morehouse won John Drew , 1853 ; Sarah Bernhardt , 1844 ; Elisabeth Bergner , 1900 . There were two ties : Ethel Barrymore , 1879 ; Lionel Barrymore , 1878 . O'Hara always wanted a clean sweep , and the slender margin of his victory infuriated him . The petty and cruel side of his nature began to surface . He denounced Morehouse , all reporters , and all newspapers . I recall Morehouse as an amiable , happy-go-lucky sort of fellow , and he put up with the abuse for quite a while . Then O'Hara pocketed the two dollars he had won and said with a sneer : " Well , are you going to buy a round or just sit there and grin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and departed . I began to get wise to some of the tricks of the Memory Machine . O'Hara had memorized a lengthy list of actors and the years of their birth . Obviously he started with a built-in advantage over Morehouse , because he already had the answers to the five actors he had nominated . But the point is that once information became lodged in John 's brain , it stayed there forever . His cockiness over the succession of victories irritated me , and I was pleased to hear much later that he had taken a bad beating on one of his parlor games . For a five-dollar bet he would challenge a person to give the full names of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame ? the backfield whose heroics had caught the fancy of the nation 's football fans . ( Harry Stuhldreher , Jim Crowley , Don Miller , and Elmer Layden . ) O'Hara had underestimated the passion of football fans for information and statistics , and after a few defeats he dropped the project . I had one last bout with the Memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses . As usual , O'Hara set me up for the kill by proposing a game on journalism , a subject on which I thought I possessed considerable information . He proposed that I name eight of the ten men who had won Pulitzer Prizes for reporting between 1917 and 1927 ( no prize was awarded in 1919 ) . I began like Man o ' War bursting out of the starting gate : 1917 : Herbert Bayard Swope , New York World ; 1920 : John J. Leary , Jr. , New York World ; 1921 : Louis Seibold , New York World ; 1922 : Kirke L. Simpson , Associated Press ; 1923 : Alva Johnston , New York Times ; 1926 : William B. Miller , Louisville Courier-Journal ; 1927 : John T. Rogers , St. Louis Post-Dispatch . There I stalled , and after ten minutes O'Hara said , " Give up ? " I nodded and handed him five dollars . " You left out three of them , " he said . " 1918 : Harold Littledale , New York Evening Post ; 1924 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Mulroy and Alvin H. Goldstein , Chicago Daily News . " " When are you going to get out of the silly newspaper business and do something worthwhile ? " O'Hara asked . @# The Memory Machine must have been a fairly steady source of income to O'Hara , and he was cunning enough to concentrate on sports in the speakeasies because that was the principal topic of conversation . How many times did Gus Dorais throw to Knute Rockne when Notre Dame upset Army by exploiting the forward pass ? Who was the American amateur who defeated the mighty Englishmen , Ted Ray and Harry Vardon , in a play-off for the U.S. Open Golf Championship ? ( Francis Ouimet . ) Who was the pitcher who threw the ball that skulled Ray Chapman , Cleveland Indians shortstop , and killed him ? ( Carl Mays . ) But the Machine could operate in other fields , too , and especially in poetry . If O'Hara read a poem he liked , it was his captive forever , and he could pour it out by the , hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat a half-hour conversation among three of us , word for word , identifying each person and what he had said . He did , and even threw in some accurate gestures as a bonus . I do n't want to belabor the Memory Machine , because I understand it is a talent possessed by more people than you would suspect . Frank Graham , a sports columnist for the New York Sun , had it . He never carried pencil or paper , and nobody ever claimed Frank had misquoted him . The Memory Machine is invaluable to reporters , because once you produce a pencil and paper , your man becomes gun-shy . If nothing is being written down , the questions and answers flow freely . There now intervened a long , arid period in my relationship with O'Hara , principally because Klink went home to Kansas and married Bill White , son of the eminent journalist William Allen White of the Emporia Gazette . That broke up the 34th Street apartment . Elizabeth went somewhere without giving me her new address or phone number , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get in touch with her through Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane . O'Hara showed up at my office one day , not looking in the best of shape , and I took him out for a drink . He said he was at work on a novel ,  | but refused all details . I tried diplomatically to steer the conversation around to money . and suggested a loan . He bristled at first , but finally accepted twenty dollars and promptly spent part of it to buy two Old Overholts on the rocks . We parted and I urged him to keep in touch . He said he would . Three weeks later I got a note written on the stationery of a small and , I suspect . somewhat sleazy hotel on West 41st Street : " I got a job . Night desk clerk here . Am in residence twenty-four hours a day . and will be glad to receive you anytime , either in dark or in daylight . " Enclosed was a twenty-dollar bill . @# Again months intervened before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked up the New York Times book section and read a review of a novel called Butterfield 8 by John O'Hara . It was a favorable review , and noted the convincing accuracy of the dialogue . The Memory Machine was apparently hitting on all eight cylinders . I bought the book next day , partly out of curiosity about the prose , and partly because Butterfield 8 was a telephone exchange and happened to be mine . I thought the book fell far short of being the Great American Novel , but there was n't any doubt that O'Hara was a fresh and lively voice in American fiction . I think the curve of his life and fortunes shot steeply upward because of Butterfield 8 . At least he was in the money , because he went to Hollywood under a handsome contract and could indulge his lifelong taste for caviar and vintage French champagne . I have no idea what he did in Hollywood , or how long he stayed there , but he must have been bored with plenty of free time on his hands . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about the adventures and misadventures in Hollywood of an actor with small talent but enormous ego . It was O'Hara at his best , and he must have spent time and money buying drinks for broken-down actors , because the prose rang as true as a bronze bell . The Memory Machine never functioned better . Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart agreed with that opinion , made a musical comedy out of the material , and called it Pal Joey . O'Hara was liberated from Hollywood . Pal Joel . broke some new ground in American musical , comedy ; it was hard-nosed and cynical instead of sticky and sentimental . Everybody on the stage was on the make for something or somebody , and Rodgers ' music and Hart 's lyrics captured the mood with precision . It was a commercial success , although not a smash hit in the same league with Oklahoma and South Pacific . I went to see Pal Joel ' , and across the years I have an enduring recollection of Vivienne Segal standing downstage left in an evening gown that enhanced her brunette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring out a song called " Bewitched , Bothered and Bewildered . " I only saw O'Hara one more time . He appeared one day at the Tuesday luncheon of the Dutch Treat Club as the guest of his publisher and spotted me at the bar . As was his custom , he behaved as though we had never been apart for more than three days : " Two Old Overholts on the rocks , " he told the bartender . He seemed subdued and melancholy , and his problem surfaced quickly . " Do you think Hemingway really said it ? " he asked . It took me a minute or so to get the situation into focus , and then I recalled . A few days earlier , Walter Winchell or one of his imitators had printed an item about Ernest Hemingway at a literary cocktail party . The conversation had turned to O'Hara and the fact that his books revealed an obsessive interest in aristocratic prep schools , exclusive clubs , fraternities , and Ivy League universities . Hemingway was quoted as having said : " O'Hara is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a collection and send him to Yale . " This shattered O'Hara because Hemingway was his idol . He once told me he had read The Sun Also Rises three times , and I suspect that the lean , terse dialogue in John 's books was inspired by Hemingway . I told him I had not been at the party and had no idea whether Hemingway had said it . Then I tried to comfort him with humor . " Anyway , " I said , " you do n't want to go to Yale . You want to go to Princeton . " " That 's right , " he said , and walked away . I 'm no literary critic , and I 'll venture no opinion about how O'Hara will rank as a novelist . I have never read many of his books because it seemed to me he had fallen into a rut with his novels about the Pennsylvania Dutch country . The dialogue , much of it irrelevant to the story , ran on and on because he was unable to shut off the Memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short stories , and I believe many of them will survive when the novels are forgotten . Well , he went to Princeton , not to the university but to the town , where he bought a house , acquired a rustic cane , wore tweeds , and became a sort of country squire . He may have been quite happy as his days dwindled down toward death . I hope so .
