txt President Carter 's aging energy bill gets a nudge from a compromise on natural gas pricing , but it will be some time before completed legislation crosses his White House desk . Next to be tackled by a weary Congress is the complex problem of energy taxes ? how much to force up oil prices to induce conservation among Americans . Such taxes , which Mr. Carter calls the centerpiece of his embattled energy plan , would only add to inflation ? at the very time the White House is gearing up to combat rising prices . Sentiment is growing in Congress to complete work on the natural gas question , attach it to three other sections of the energy bill already finished , and send the package to Mr. Carter ? shorn of the complex tax problem . Such taxes ? a levy on crude oil at the wellhead and a tax on industrial users of oil and natural gas ? might be considered later . The President could tell Americans and the world that the United States finally had a national energy plan in law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission of taxes . Rightly or wrongly , meanwhile , a sense of urgency about an impending world oil shortage appears to be evaporating , as experts push back the expected date when global demand for petroleum may exceed supplies . This attitude is deplored by Mr. Carter , by Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger , and by America 's European allies , all of whom believe Americans must reduce their oil con-sumption to avoid world economic disruption in the next decade . U.S. demand for oil continues to run ahead of last year , although imports of foreign oil are down , primarily because domestic crude from Alaska is on the market . // From page 1 Congress may omit energy taxes Latest Department of Energy ( DOE ) figures show that , in the four weeks ending May 12 , Americans burned 18 million barrels of petroleum daily ? 4.2 percent more than during the same period last year , 10.3 percent above the 1976 level , and 11.5 percent above consumption in 1973 , the year the oil crisis hit the world . Gasoline consumption , a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this May than in the same month of any previous year . Meanwhile , what does the congressional accord on natural gas pricing ? which still must work its way through several legislative stages ? mean for the 41 million homeowners , 3.4 million commercial users , and 200,000 industrialists who burn this clean fuel ? Costs are going up ? but natural gas is still a relative bargain for homeowners . Residential users , according to officials of the American Gas Association ( AGA ) , for at least the next five years will have lower fuel bills than those Americans who heat and cool their homes with oil or electricity . The retail cost of natural gas rose 13 percent last year , says the AGA ? 8 percent due to general inflation , and 5 percent because more expensive gas began to work its way into supply pipelines . " For the next several years , " said an AGA official , " homeowners , hospitals , schools , and other high priority users will not be paying much more for their gas than the additional cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bear the brunt of higher costs for new gas , until this gas reaches the cost of alternative fuels , principly oil .
