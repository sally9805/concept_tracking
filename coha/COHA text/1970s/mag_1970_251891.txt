Women have long appeared as badly suited for water as fish out of it . Bathing suits did them proud on the beach , but anyone intent on snorkeling or scuba diving was bound to find her bikini at loose ends down in the deep . Trouble was that so few women were interested in underwater sports that designers gave little thought to aquatic chic . By now , though , female skindivers are everywhere , and fashion has caught up with their demands ; at long last they are able to go down to the sea in style . <P> Shocking as Eels . The new wet suits , exotic and brilliant as tropical fish , keep women just as fashionable under water as they should be on the sands of St. Tropez . Diving outfits by White Stag and Healthways glimmer in vivid hues ; Parkway Fabricators offers a spectrum of shades , plus prints and patterns in color combinations as shocking as eels . The Voit Rubber Corp . highlights a collection of dazzlingly designed short-sleeved jackets , most popular for water-skiing but also considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monaco and Mets Pitcher Jerry Koosman . <P> Underwater wear has not always looked so good . Time was when the only safe way an amateur diver could tolerate cold deep-sea temperatures was in the same sort of black rubber " dry suit " ( socalled because it kept water out ) worn by U.S. Navy frogmen during World War II . Effective but cumbersome , the old suit required courses in calisthenics to put it on : one version had to be squirmed into through the neck hole , another through a single narrow slit in the front . Getting dressed too quickly resulted in overheating and perspiration . Appropriately enough , it was the company owned by famed French Underwater Explorer Jacques Cousteau ( U.S. Divers Co. ) that studied the problems of the dry suit and answered them in the marketplace with the wet suit . <P> Death on Foam . The basic strategy in wet-suit design is not to keep water out but to let just enough in to absorb body heat and circulate it . To achieve that end , manufacturers used a specially treated synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas for better insulation ) that allowed the proper slow seepage of water . But the early wet suits looked as awful as dry suits , only wetter . And they were black . Dye , it turned out , was death on foam neoprene ; any injection of color considerably weakened the rubber . So did regular exposure to air . Finally the solution was found : a protective nylon knit fabric that would adhere to the neoprene and keep it durable whatever the color or weather . <P> Slingshot Neckline . For dedicated swimmers who do not plunge to the depths , there is still the old tank suit , but Gertrude Ederle would be astounded . Hardly a high-fashion designer has not had his way with it ; as a result , the style abounds in a flurry of top-label interpretations , all faithful to the pure lines and practicality of the original , but a far cry away in fit and flair . Geoffrey Beene and Jacques Tiffeau stick to the basic , scoop-necked design , but Donald Brooks makes a slingshot of the neckline of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the waist and leaves one entire shoulder off another . Children 's Designer Florence Eiseman , yielding to demands by mothers who want to look as good as daughters , makes a terry-cloth tank suit that absorbs figure faults along with water .
