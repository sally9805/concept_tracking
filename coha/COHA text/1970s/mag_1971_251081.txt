When Army Air Force Captain Robert A. Lewis set off toward Hiroshima as copilot of the Enola Gay on Aug. 6 , 1945 , he began a brief log of the mission , scribbling on the backs of War Department forms . Last week the diary was auctioned off at Manhattan 's Parke-Bernet Galleries for $37,000 to a rare-manuscript dealer . In it , there was a glimpse , as in a time-lapse film , of the moment when men first used the Bomb against one another . <P> Lewis was on hand for the auction , and he read some of the diary aloud . It had first been published in 1946-but 25 years later , his voice gave his words a special poignancy : " At 0730 we loaded . The bomb is now alive and it 's a funny feeling knowing it 's right in back of you . Knock wood . . . We started our climb to 30,000 feet at 0740 . Well , folks , it 's not long now . " As the B-29 let the Bomb go : " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bombardier and the right seat jockey or pilot both forgot to put on their dark glasses and therefore witnessed the flash . Then in about 15 seconds after the flash , there were two very distinct slaps , then that was all the physical effect we felt . <P> " We then turned the ship so we could observe results . . . The city was 90% covered with smoke and a large column of white cloud , which in less than three minutes reached 30,000 feet and then went at least 50,000 . . . Just how many Japs did we kill ? I honestly have the feeling of groping for words to explain this or I might say My God what have we done . "
