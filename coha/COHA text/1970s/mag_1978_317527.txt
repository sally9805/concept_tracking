Even more slippery than Michigan 's horse thieves , surely , are the Los Angeles truck drivers who swipe 55-gal. drums of used grease-about $25,000 worth each week-from local restaurants and drive-ins . The goo , worth $40 per bbl. , is valuable because it is reprocessed into a food additive that causes cattle and poultry to gain weight . The thieves have oozed up across the nation , but most actively in Southern California , the fastness of fast food . Sometimes posing as legitimate grease collectors , they have cut chains placed on the outdoor grease barrels , smashed through protective iron gates , and driven over chain fences . Police are not doing much about cleaning up the grease mess . Says Alan Cohen , president of the Reliable Grease Co. : " The police tell us they 've got the Los Angeles Strangler to worry about . " Besides , unless the criminals were caught in the act , they would prove difficult to prosecute . Asks one police official : " How do you identify hot grease ? "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
