The grizzled old Westerner stares longingly at the Gila monster . Reaching slowly and cautiously down , the prospector has the lizard shot right out of his hand . " You peckerwoods just raised hell with our supper , " he complains as two grungy rounders advance on him . " It 's just like you said , Hogue , " says one , " there 's enough water for two but not for three . " They rob him of his canteen and leave him to die . <P> That is the beginning of a new movie called The Ballad of Cable Hogue and , truth to tell , there is not much more of a plot after that . Cable ( Jason Robards ) stubbornly battles thirst and wins , discovering a water hole in the desert . He stakes a claim , swears revenge on his two partners ( Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones ) and meets a tasty tart named Hildy ( Stella Stevens ) , who winds up keeping house at his combination water hole and stagecoach stop . He falls in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joshua Duncan Sloane ( David Warner ) and who can spin his clerical collar around into layman 's garb faster than most men can draw a pistol . Everyone sort of threatens , jokes and loves each other , and gets in each other 's way . All in all , pretty unlikely ingredients for an exceptionally fine movie . <P> Middle-Aged . That it achieves such distinction so effortlessly is due in large part to the wizardry of Director-Producer Sam Peckinpah , who makes shooting a movie look as easy as whittling . Cable Hogue shows a new side of Peckinpah . It is not so melancholy as Ride the High Country or so raw and violent as The Wild Bunch . It is quiet , lyrical , bawdy , funny and sad in almost equal portions , exactly as a good back-room yarn should be . <P> Cable , like other Peckinpah heroes , is a man who knows he is fast becoming an anachronism . Pike Bishop and his band of middle-aged outlaws in The Wild Bunch realized that the days of living by their guns were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greeted with derisive hoots as he rode down the main street of a booming little Western town at the opening of Ride the High Country . Cable is a frontiersman at heart , with no love for cities or their inhabitants . It shames him to admit he can not spell his name , and he has no notion of what collateral is . But such men were the essence of the new country , and Cable 's ever-prospering water hole becomes a symbol of the opening West . <P> Cable dies as must have been preordained : a motorcar starts rolling down a sandhill and the frontiersman , dealing with the machine as if it were an unruly stallion , is run down by progress . It is a measure of Peckinpah 's great skill that he makes such a mechanical symbolic device not only work but seem perfectly fitting and inevitable . <P> Lickerish Cleric . Not all of Peckinpah 's devices work so well . An engraved face on a $5 bill waggles its eyes suggestively and needlessly as Cable ponders spending the money on Hildy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues . Even his rambling lends the story a leisurely lyricism rare in films today .
