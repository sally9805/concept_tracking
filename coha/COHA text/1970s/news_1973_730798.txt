txt The announcement that China and Australia are to negotiate a long-term wheat agreement is being greeted with outward calm by Canadian trade officials here . But it may mean that Canada can no longer take for granted her position as China 's principal wheat supplier . All here are agreed that the Chinese are . determined to improve their bargaining position relative to the , wheat exporting nations , and will not hesitate to play Canada and Australia off against each other in the interests of a better deal for themselves . Poor h  --  rvest likely Although it is too early yet to make any confident projections on the current Chinese harvest , there have been enough reports in the press of difficulties with drought and flood in grain growing regions to indicate that fears of another poor crop may also be a factor in the Chinese strategy . Another factor , widely discussed among diplomats , is the recent top-level decision to enter into credit arrangements for some of China 's more expensive imports . // *china eyes Australia , not Canada , for wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the move back toward long-range economic planning of the kind that was interrupted by the " Cultural revolution . " From this viewpoint , credit buying and longterm deals for wheat are twin faces of the same coin . Australianmove The Australians , moving fast to reestablish their position in a market they once shared equally with Canada , made wheat one of the principal talking points in recent discussions here between their Overseas Trade Minister , J. F. Vairns , and his Chinese counterpart , Pai Hsiang-kuo . The result was a communique both reflected the expectation of both sides that wheat will play a paramount role in the future trade between them ? just as it has done in China 's trade with Canada , which , has sold more than $1 billion worth of wheat to the people 's republic in the past 12 years . Banner year in , ' 72 The best of these ' years came in 1972 , when Canada , benefitting from a two-year period in which the Chinese cut Australia out of the market for political reasons , delivered wheat worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the , total value of all Canadian exports to China during the year . , Canadian officials therefore were delighted-when Premier- Chou-En-lai , - in a discussion with ' External Affairs Minister Mitchell Sharp here last August , gave his personal pledge that Canada could count on China as a long-term customer for her wheat the &it; such commitment the Chinese had given since the start of the wheat deals back in 1961 .

Hard bargaining The questing that arises is why the Chinese have gone beyond a verbal commitment in their thlkirViv with the Australians , offering to negotiate a long-term contractual arrangement , without so far offering a similar arrangement to Canada , , until recently the , most ' favored of her wheat suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a high-ranking Chinese official who , discussing the international wheat situation recently , remarked unfavorably upon the hard bargain driven by China 's " old friends " among the wheat exporting nations last year , when drought and floods combined to reduce the Cninese grain harvest by 10 million tons .

Exact prices are never quoted in the Canadian Wheat Board 's announcements . Some idea of the sharp price increase faced by the Chinese can be garnered from the approximate figures quoted by the Canadian Wheat Board for the two sales it made to China during the year . The first sale , in May , provided for a total of-1:15-millibrilong tons , at a cost of about $100 million . The second , in November , provided for 1.6 million long tons , at a cost of about 050 million ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
