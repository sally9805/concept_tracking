A black man in America has serious and sometimes tragic problems . But he is also subject to seemingly minor irritations that crop up innumerable times during the ordinary business of getting through a day . They are all consequences of the basic trouble-his inequality . They sound petty , says a black businessman , " but a toothache is petty too . When you live with a toothache year in and year out , it adds up . And what it adds up to is not petty . " <P> Even the black whose earning power has put him , theoretically at least , into the financial middle class has his problems . An American editor , black but married to a white woman , recently returned to New York after a longish stint in Canada . His experiences while apartment hunting , always a harrowing ordeal in New York , were significant . " Friday , " reads his diary . " Answered Times ad . Four rooms in East 70s for $170 . Start scratching out checks when landlady says leave name and phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Saturday . Try again on West End Avenue . Super slams door in face . Later , go to Park Avenue and get stopped by very cool doorman . ' We never rent on Sunday , sir , ' he says . A week later : We flee Manhattan and head for Brooklyn . Broker sends us to ground-floor tenement with smell of urine , puddles of excrement , broken windows . Next place is also unlivable , so we insist on seeing five-room floor-through advertised in newspaper . It turns out to be a palace . We write out checks , get told to fill out forms and wait . A week later we 're told it was rented to somebody else . <P> " A week later : I decide I 'm a liability and wife should go alone . She does . Landlady charmed with wife . ' We have a cat , ' says wife . ' Do n't worry , ' says landlady , ' we 'll just love to have you , your cat and your husband . ' I go over to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a screaming , hysterical lady wo n't let us into the apartment . ' It 's the cat , it seems . ' My poor old mother is allergic to cats , ' which is funny because she has had a cat for two years . We call the Commission on Human Rights and they send an investigator . After four hours of shouting , screaming , weeping and some shoving , the landlady is served-or rather swatted-with a subpoena . Finally we move in , landlady threatening to kill our cat . Only later does she subside into some measure of civility . " <P> But the irritations of being black also occur in less important situations than trying to rent an apartment . Try hailing a cab . " On my graduation day , " recalls one Boston man , " I walked off the stage with my Ph.D . and I could n't even get a cab to take me home . They 'll slow down and then speed away . If you get into one that 's standing still , chances are the driver will refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Four cabs passed me the other night before I was finally picked up-by a hippie driver . Before he picked me up , I had grabbed a bottle and was going to throw it through the window of the next cab that went by . "
