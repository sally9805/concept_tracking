For four nights last week , students rioted in the Croatian city of Zagreb . The demonstrations , which left 400 students under arrest , were one of the worst outbreaks of civil disorder in Yugoslavia since the Communists took control more than 26 years ago . What brought on the violence was a long-simmering dispute between the 4,300,000 fiery-tempered Croats , who form the second-largest and politically most troublesome of Yugoslavia 's six republics , and their ancient enemies the Serbs , who have traditionally dominated the central government in Belgrade . <P> The confrontation took place despite the best efforts of President Josip Broz Tito to prevent it . Tito last summer forced the central government to surrender much of its political and economic powers to the country 's six republics and two autonomous provinces . The Croats , as it turned out , were not satisfied . Encouraged by extremist exile groups in West Germany and Eastern Europe , many Croats continued to accuse the central government of taking away too much of the republic 's earnings from foreign tourists and giving the money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate Croatian army , a separate airline and separate membership in the United Nations . <P> Out of Control . Croatia 's Communist leaders , most notably Dr. Savka Dabcevic-Kucar , the brilliant woman economist who for the past three years has served as chairman of the Central Committee , seemed either incapable or unwilling to halt the separatist agitation . In fact , some observers suggested that committee members secretly welcomed the agitation since it forced the Belgrade leaders to grant even more concessions to Croatia . <P> The showdown began three weeks ago when 30,000 Croatian students went out on strike in support of the nationalistic demands . The revolt convinced Tito that the republic 's Communist leaders had lost control of the situation and that Yugoslav unity was endangered . He denounced the strike as " counterrevolutionary " and sharply criticized Croatian party leaders for allowing the separatist forces to exploit the republic 's economic grievances . At a hastily convened conference of Croatian leaders , Tito declared that he had lost faith in their promises to work harder at controlling the separatists . " Criticism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough , " he told them . <P> They took the hint . Two days later , in an unusual televised session of the Croatian Central Committee , seven ranking leaders , including Dr. Dabcevic-Kucar , confessed their shortcomings and handed in their resignations . At Tito 's behest , one of his old associates from partisan days agreed to supervise the rebuilding of the Croatian party . He is Vladimir Bakaric , 59 , who is a member of the Executive Bureau in Belgrade , which is the party 's equivalent of a collective federal presidency . He favors greater economic and political autonomy for Croatia but within the framework of the Yugoslav federation .
