In 1973 Moslem observance of the month of fasting called Ramadan coincided with Yom Kippur , Judaism 's most sacred day . So did the start of the October war . This year Ramadan coincided with Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year 's Day . There was no recurrence of open warfare , but Israeli jets did attack villages in the mountainous border region of southern Lebanon known as the Arqub . Since 1969 , this area , which fans out from the slopes of Mount Hermon , has been known as " Fatahland " because Palestinian guerrillas regularly cross it from havens in Syria to infiltrate the Israeli border . In reprisal for fedayeen raids , or to deter recurrences , Israeli aircraft , artillery and armored columns have regularly punished the Lebanese countryside . Last week 's bombing of Hasbaya , Rashaya Fukhar and four other villages , according to the Lebanese government , marked the 65th Israeli air attack on southern Lebanon ; in addition , there have been more than 1,000 artillery barrages and 222 armed border crossings . <P> Civilian Victims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance and to cut the so-called " Arafat trail " between Syria and Israel . They also serve a second purpose : putting pressure on Lebanon to police the Palestinians . But the main victims over the years have not been the mobile commandos but the Lebanese families who live in the border villages . Among the victims of last week 's raids was the septuagenarian mukhtar ( headman ) of Hasbaya ; he was the 137th civilian to be killed so far . In addition , 402 Lebanese have been wounded and 91 have been captured and forcibly taken across the border into Israel for interrogation . <P> Almost every village in southern Lebanon has its variation on a common theme of misery . Last week TIME Correspondent William Stewart visited Rashaya Fukhar in the heart of the Arqub and sent this report : <P> As the road from Tyre turns inland at Naqura , the scenery suddenly changes from lush and crowded to barren and empty . As it wound through Dhayra , Awad Dib , a 35-year-old tobacco farmer and father of nine , could be seen doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fedayeen raid on Qiryat Shemona that killed 18 Israelis ( TIME , April 22 ) , an armored column rolled into the village . " About 35 men came to my farm , " he told me . " They said I helped the fedayeen . They took all the furniture in my house and piled it in one room . Then they took my family outside and they blew up the house . My brother and I and two others were kept in Israel for two months . " <P> At ' Udaysah , the Lebanese road parallels an Israeli road across the barbed-wire border . Israeli automobiles zoom along past rich orchards and a soldier grins and waves . Rashaya Fukhar is slightly different from other villages in the Arqub . For one thing , most of its inhabitants are Christian . For another , every structure in the village is made of stone , which can save lives . Almost every house has doors off hinges , cracked walls or damaged roofs ; some have been totally destroyed . Two months ago , a villager named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid and killed . He was Rashaya Fukhar 's third fatality in such attacks ; 25 others have been wounded . A widow and seven children survive him .
