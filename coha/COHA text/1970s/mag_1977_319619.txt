Britain 's heavily burdened taxpayers last week got an early Christmas present from Denis Healey , the Labor government 's stern Chancellor of the Exchequer and previously a champion of austerity . Presenting his second minibudget of the year to a tune of increasing optimism over North Sea oil , Healey abandoned his Scrooge-like posture to unwrap a package of tax cuts and state-pension increases worth $1.75 billion this fiscal year ( which ends next March ) and $3.5 billion in the following fiscal year . Under the proposals , a married couple earning $8,750 a year will pay $95 less income tax ; Britons will be allowed to spend more pounds abroad ; widows and pensioners will get a one-shot , tax-free Christmas bonus of $18 each ; and small businesses will be granted some relief from the tax on sales or other transfers of business assets . SANTA DENIS ! cried a headline in London 's racy tabloid the Sun . <P> Whether the timing is right for such stimulus to the economy is highly debatable . Prime Minister James Callaghan a few weeks ago told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verge of an era of prosperity that " will eclipse anything seen since we became an industrial power 200 years ago . " In his speech last week , Healey optimistically forecast that inflation would fall to a single figure . At present , inflation , though down , is still running at a high annual rate of 16.5% , and some unions are pushing for wage boosts going beyond the government 's guideline of 10% a year . <P> In fact , the budget seemed shaped much more by political than by economic considerations . After trailing badly for a long time . Labor is now running neck and neck with the Conservative Party in public-opinion polls . Callaghan must call an election within the next 24 months , but could do so earlier if Labor takes a strong lead-as it might if Healey 's minibudget proves popular . The London Times editorialized that the budget seemed designed " to keep the political initiative rather than for any purpose of managing the economy . " Tories , bitter because Labor had stolen their policy of aid to small businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repentance ... an electioneering budget . " <P> Healey did make a plea for further wage restraint . He tentatively promised more tax cuts and spending increases next spring-but only if unions adhere to the 10% wage guideline . Even if they do , some economists worry , the Labor government in its rush to secure victory at the polls may spur a new round of inflationary consumer spending . Labor Party leaders said at Brighton that Britain ought to spend North Sea revenues to modernize its industry and build new income-producing businesses . By giving most of its goodies to consumers , this minibudget goes in the opposite direction .
