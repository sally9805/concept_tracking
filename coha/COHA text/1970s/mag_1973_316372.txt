Rampaging floods in India and Pakistan . A devastating drought in Africa . The disappearance of fish off the coast of Peru . These recent , widely reported phenomena all have something in common . Though they were triggered by nature , their magnitude was increased disastrously by man 's trying to expand his food production without considering the ecological side effects . <P> On the Indian subcontinent , residents of the Himalayan foothills have been chopping down trees at a prodigious rate to get more cropland for the growing population . The deforestation was particularly apparent to Economist Lester R. Brown , an agricultural specialist with the Overseas Development Council in Washington , who has worked periodically in India for 20 years . <P> Brown found that the once forested areas in the foothills where the Indus , the Ganges and the other major river systems originate had been " heavily cleared . " That brought disaster in August and September , when the subcontinent was hit by the heaviest monsoon rains in decades . " Upstream , " Brown explains , " the forests that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . The rate of runoff into rivers was therefore much faster . " Thus rainfall that caused moderate flooding 20 years ago , this year inundated millions of acres of croplands in six Indian states and southern Pakistan . <P> Terrible Mistakes . In Africa , a five-year drought has parched the 2,600 mile-long " savannah belt , " just south of the Sahara Desert . As a result , large portions of six African nations-Senegal , Mauritania , Upper Volta , Mali , Chad and Niger-now subsist mainly on international contributions of food ( TIME , Sept. 3 ) . Although man can not be blamed for the lack of rain , a recent study by the U.S. Agency for International Development reports that the Africans ' efforts to gain a better living from the potentially productive land have made a bad situation much worse . <P> Because the semiarid region is ecologically fragile , reports AID , " mistakes in the use of soil , water and vegetation are magnified . " Trees have been cut down for fuel , savannah grass has been replaced by seasonal crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging of all , the inhabitants have allowed their huge herds of livestock to denude the land through overgrazing . These practices , combined with the drought , have killed off the natural vegetation and allowed the Sahara to creep southward-in some places , says AID , by " as much as 30 miles a year . " <P> Peru 's loss is in the sea , where the cold waters of the Peru ( or Humboldt ) Current once teemed with anchovies . Every year millions of tons of the sardine-like fish were caught and ground into fish meal , which was then sold abroad as a high-protein feed for livestock and poultry . About every seven years , though , the anchovy bonanza was interrupted for a few months when a mysterious flow of warm water overrode the cold current , causing the fish to disappear temporarily .
