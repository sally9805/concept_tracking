Earlier this month Lloyd Cutler  --  a well-known Washington superlawyer , a quintessential member of the establishment that candidate Jimmy Carter railed against  --  began work as counsel to the President , one of the senior staff in the White House . He replaced Robert Lipshutz , who exited the city as quietly as he served in it . But few who know Lloyd Cutler expect similar reticence and ineffectuality . One does not reduce his income by 80 percent and lose the prestigious opportunity to counsel the auto , drug , steel , television and railroad industries in order to draft Law Day speeches . We were somewhat taken aback when , in an interview that appeared in Newsday , President Carter appeared to be unaware of the extensive services his new counsel has rendered to some of the nation 's largest corporations . The President theorized that Cutler was probably just carrying out assignments handed him by his law firm . Obviously , the White House personnel department fouled up or Cutler forgot to send along his resume . To rectify the gap in the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career excerpted from The Unseen Power of Washington Lawyers by Mark Green ( Viking/Grossman ) , which was first published in 1975 and revised in 1978 . ? The Editors MARK GREEN T . o his admirers he is the model of the modern lawyer , but his critics would sentence him to the eclectic chair . He represents the American drug in- industry and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , counsels the violence-prone automobile industry and the President 's Commission on Violence , innovates in the civil liberties area and belongs to the discriminatory Metropolitan and Kenwood clubs , and advocates a Justice , Department more independent of outside pressures while he occasionally lobbies it into submission . , " Lloyd Cutler is a strange man , " , said Joe Laitin , who has worked closely with Cutler and has been an official in the Office of Management and Budget : " On the one hand he 's a corporate devil and on the other hand he 's a 1930s Mark Green , director of Public Citizen 's Congress Watch , is the author andeditor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of Who Runs Congress ? , which is being published this month by Viking and Bantam. liberal . " Ben Gordon , staff assistant on the Senate Small Business Committee , says flatly that " when I see Lloyd Cutler representing anybody , I know that it is not in the public interest . " Yet public-interest lawyer Charles Halpern respects Cutler because " he does as much free work as any lawyer in town . " Perhaps more than any other Washington lawyer , Cutler seems to epitomize that dilemma of the corporate liberal  --  a progressive promoting conservative causes who can very suddenly reverse roles to do good works . He moves with the deftness of a chameleon between the board rooms of corporate power and the anterooms of advocacy groups , as each comes to accept him as one of them . The leading influence in the Washington law firm of Wilmer , Cutler &; Pickering , Cutler now 611 spends the bulk of his professional life representing companies such as General Motors , I.B.M. , CBS and Kaiser Industries . Ideologically Cutler sees himself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of center and am a believer in social change . " He is a committed civil libertarian  --  proposing , during the McCarthy years , a system of civil-damage suits against those giving intentionally false testimony against individuals , recommending in 1972 to then Treasury Secretary John Connally a citizens ' review board to watchdog the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and recently representing a newsmen 's group protesting the way American Telephone and Telegraph was turning over phone records to snooping prosecutors . At the same time , Cutler appears a strong believer in the business sector , telling author David Ignatius : " Business ethics among big firms , like I.B.M. , etc. , are very high  --  both in terms of personal ethics and corporate decisions . Most of the companies that have been around for a long time make a lot of money anyway , and have no need to cut corners . . . . Outside counsel and directors exert a great deal of ethical influence . " This is a frequent leitmotif ? Cutler civilizing his clients . He once described chief executives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole new generation of men from the engine plant must be trained about public affairs . " Trained by Cutler . Lawyering at this interface of business and government , Cutler has developed a canny ability for negotiating the differences between these two sectors of society  --  which-is why he is often called into the later stages of an antitrust case or a delicate Congressional hearing . Just as he has tried to combine in himself the conflicting roles of private-interest and public-interest advocacy , so he seeks to harmonize conflicts between others . His negotiating talent , report colleagues , clients and opponents ? alike , is largely based on his personal ability to sound so reasonable , so plausible . Except for an occasional lapse into temper , there are no histrionic ' tures , no big expensive cigars , no hearty Rotarian hellos . Cutler rather speaks in the well-modulated and crafted phrases familiar to the veteran diplomat or lawyer : " it is not unreasonable that , " , " to the extent that , " " on the other hand " ? phrases that always cushion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him logically and apparently effortlessly . He is quick to spot any slight flaw in an opponent 's argument , and then march his own arguments through that opening no matter how tight the squeeze . When all this is combined with a knack to generously concede small bits of perimeter territory ( foreign corporate payoffs are deplorable ) while his major points remain an unassailable fortress ( we should n't legislatively outlaw such payoffs ) , Cutler gently pulls adversaries along to places they did not intend to go . Lyndon Johnson would understand the style . His national security adviser , Walt Rostow , also had that ability to calmly , resonantly , confidently weave certain facts into a very believable tapestry . . . . In the area of drug advocacy , especially , Washington lawyers have an obvious impact on all consumers as well as on specific clients . To the extent that lawyers shape policy , they help determine which drugs enter our bodies and which do not . " Potential victims far away from any policy judgment , are faceless , " commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Administration Commissioner James Goddard , " but the immediate losers are closer at hand  --  in your inner lobby . They are the sleek , suave , sophisticated , stripe-tied , sympathetic , sensitive representatives of business . . . . And they are reasonable men with reasonable suggestions . " One of these reasonable men is Lloyd Cutler . Whether as witness or negotiator or litigator , Cutler represents the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association  --  the industry 's trade association , with 135 member firms and a $4.4 million budget  --  for fees reportedly up to $100,000 in a single year . Cutler is often called upon to help the drug industry in Congressional testimony  --  an event which can be either as prearranged as the thousandth running of a Broadway play or as dramatic as the most contentious cross-examination . The Senate Small Business Committee 's continuing hearing on drugs at times approached the latter level during its forays into the pricing and advertising practices of the drug industry . During the 1967 hearings Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin  --  so bothersome a drug opponent that the industry spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968 ? was pitted against Dr. Leslie Lueck , the director of quality control for Parke , Davis and Company , and against Lloyd Cutler , his lawyer . Cutler prepared his witnesses before they took the stand and interrupted them when he sensed trouble . He fulfilled his life-preserver function during the testimony of the P.M.A. 's economic experts , four academics hired for a total of $34,000 to argue why drug prices were so high . Cutler 's performance was smooth and impressive , leading him later to assure his pharmaceutical clients , in the privacy of a Senate office building elevator , that " we really showed them today . " All chuckled . Yet all was not smoothness at the hearings . Cutler again found himself increasingly intervening between client and committee as a well-versed staff pressed his witnesses . After one questioner challenged his assumption that recent lower prices indicated a competitive industry ( rather than one formerly afflicted with monopoly profits ) , Cutler exploded : Mr. Cutler : You have convinced me , if I needed any convincing , that no fact presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Just a minute . . . . Mr. Cutler : I am sorry , Mr. Chairman , I withdraw that remark . T hen came the chloromycetin controversy . The drug was effective for most prescribed infections but also carried a high risk of death for certain users . Based on statistics from the California State De-partment of Public Health , Morton Mintz , Washington Post reporter on consumer and drug affairs , estimated that some 666 users of chloromycetin died in the 1950s . Dr. Albe Watkins testified how he gave his own 10-year-old son chloromycetin after being assured of its safety . The child died within two weeks , both from unstoppable bleeding and the gradually disintegrating effects of gangrene . In a letter to the company , Dr. Watkins said , " I might have done better had I taken a gun and shot him  --  at least he would n't have suffered . " Because of such tragedies  --  not to mention the passage of the 1962 law encouraging more candid advertising and labeling ? Dr. Lueck of Parke , Davis admitted that he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed the present advertising requirements were justifiable . Senator Nelson then suddenly produced an advertisement appearing in a British monthly journal , The Lancet , which promoted chloromycetin without indicating the side effects . Although the then current American advertisement for this drug contained about 1,300 words of caution and warnings  --  included because of F.D.A. compulsion ? the British ad contained not a word of- warning . Ironically , both ads appeared in one publication , The Lancet , which had an American edition as well as an English edition . Murmuring swept through-the interested audience . " No warning at all id that ad . How do you explain that ? " asked Senator Nelson . ' At first unable to reply , Lueck finally stammered that they met " the legal requirements of whatever country we distributed our products in . . . . " Cutler sensed a sinking client . " Mr. Chairman , I think you will find that the point you are developing is true of every ad in this magazine , which is a distinguished magazine of the British Medical Society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appropriate requirements . " Senator Nelson flashed an anger uncharacteristic at Senate hearings : . Senator Nelson : . . . This sure shocks me . What the Witness says is we will meet the standards of the country where the drug is sold . That means , of course , there is not a single underdeveloped country in the world that has any defense against the exploitation of their people for profit by an American corporation that does not warn them of the serious , mighty serious , possibly fatal consequences here . . . . Mr. Cutler : This is a British Medical Society . The British doctors are sophisticated doctors . Just as sophisticated as the doctors in this country . This meets all their requirements . . . . Senator Nelson : Any company , , drug company or any other kind of company , that would do that , I would be pleased to indict on moral grounds . Your testimony is that you will meet the standards of the country in which you are advertising , not the standards of safety which the witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Which gives this warning that is put in ads in this country . But in countries where the people do not know any better , where the country is not protected by laws , you will tell us that you have no compunction about running an ad that will fool a doctor , as you did in California in 1961 . Nelson went on to describe the travail of Dr. Watkins , concluding , " I should think you people would not be able to sleep . " Cutler complained about Nelson 's free-swinging criticism of " a company that brought you some evidence you have been asking for , " and he three times repeated his objection that the subcommittee had surprised his witness ( and himself ) with unexpected questions . Nelson retorted with an open-ended invitation for Cutler to return with ' the " proper " witnesses , which he never did . The chairman then summarized the day 's hearings by turning pointedly to Cutler : " It shocks me that you do not even blush . . , . If this is the standard of ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fellows are in for some sad-trouble . I do not think this country will stand for it . " Nelson 's assault had clearly unsettled Cutler . One spectator chortled and said : " It was the first time I saw the whites of Lloyd Cutler 's eyeS . A lawyer like that does n't like to be embarrassed . " A Parke , Davis attorney later recalled that Cutler was upset because " it was one of the only times that he was a witness . " Worse , Cutler no doubt considered himself an innocent witness . He was a lawyer , for God 's sake , not a corporate official . If Colombians did or did n't obtain drugs due to his client , it was not for him to know . When asked , three years after the Nelson exchange , whether Parke , Davis still failed to advertise side effects in Britain or elsewhere as thoroughly as it advertised them in the United States , he answered , " I do n't know . " But was he not even curious ? " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutler wrote that " American cars  --  whatever their shortcomings  --  are among the world 's safest . . . the automobile industry has made com- mendable progress in many aspects of automobile safety . " To a reporter in 1969 Cutler said , " There are no more ethical companies in terms of business honesty than Kaiser or General Motors  --  despite what critics see as their social obtuseness . " Lloyd Cutler had done work for the auto industry before 1966 . In the mid-1950s , for example , he helped Kaiser Industries arrange to build auto plants in Argentina  --  a deli , cate negotiation involving financing by the Agency for International Development and an Argentine tariff monopoly for Kaiser . A decade later he occasionally advised General Motors which local defense lawyers to retain on the many product-liability cases filed against it . But if it is crisis that draws two people even closer together , Lloyd Cutler and General Motors really got to know each other in 1966 , the year Detroit had a blowout . In 1965 Senator Abraham Ribicoff 's Executive Reorganization Subcommittee began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not seem to share the subcommittee 's concern . " If the drivers did everything they should , " said Harry F. Barr , a G.M. vice president , " there would n't , be accidents , would there ? " John Bugas , a Ford vice president , later argued before the Senate Commerce Committee that no regulation was necessary , since the industry could regulate itself ( a view which prompted Senator Maurine Neuberger to reply , " I say , Ha-ha ' " ) . These views reflected the corporate hubris of being a ( then ) $40-billion-a-year industiy and the only major transportation industry free of government regulation . But by early 1966 the industry was backpedaling from Ralph Nader 's Unsafe at Any Speed and G.M. 's now well-known investigation of Nader . After much of the damage was done , Cutler registered as a lobbyist in April for the Automobile Manufacturers Association ( now called the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States ) . " Lloyd Cutler was hired to pick up the pieces , " observed White House adviser Joseph Califano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auto-safety bill . The industry obviously needed a face-lift , and Cutler surgically provided it . As with the 1962 Drug Amendments , he and his clients realized that sentiments favored some auto-safety bill ; they worked to make it as painless as possible . The Cutler impact was immediately noticeable to Paul.Sitton of the Commerce Department , one of the initiators of the legislation : " Suddenly Bugas in the House was saying that he recognized the problems and the need for some legislation . He was really saying , We 'll love you to death . ' At the same time Cutler was meeting with us and saying , Let us sit down like reasonable men . . . . The industry are-not criminals . ' " Cutler admirers see this performance as an example of the Washington lawyer 's " civilizing " his corporate clients . And Cutler  --  along with Theodore Sorenson of New York 's Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton &; Garrison , who specially counseled G.M. president James Roche  --  did mellow their client 's more outrageous posturings . But critics see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same destination : the weakest safety bill possible . " Lloyd would come over every day with new amendments to dilute the bill , " said Sitton . " They were consistent , persistent attempts to undo the public purpose of the act . " Paul Halpern , a political scientist writing a book about these events , said that " the A.M.A. and Cutler told the press that they favored a bill when , in fact , they were trying to undermine it . " Wilmer , Cutler &; Pickering is representing Ford against the Department of Transportation 's ( D.O.T. ) proposals for the installation of " air bags . " Air bags inflate to the size of two pillows four one-hundredths of a second after a car accident and form a protective cushion between motorists and , the steering assembly , the windshield and the instrument panel . They therefore prevent the " second collision " of driver against car interior , which is when most injuries and deaths occur . The idea is that when a car stops dead , the passengers wo n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in part because it had developed far more experience and know-how about air bags by 1969 than had its competitors ) , but Ford , Chrysler and American Motors were opposed . Their insistent opposition succeeded in obtaining three D.O.T . delays in the proposed date of implementation . And in May 1971 they ( but not G.M. ) filed suit . Representing Ford were both Cutler and John Pickering , as well as two firm associates and a Cincinnati law firm . Their brief argued that air bags were less protective than seat belts , had been faultily tested , and were beyond the authority of the agency . The case was argued on April 20 , 1972 , before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a typical public interest/ private interest battle . Lowell Dodge , then head , of the Center for Auto Safety , described the scene : " The court was divided into two halves , one for the government and one for industry . I wish I had a photograph to display the difference . There were two inexperienced and nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle . " Pickering made Ford 's oral presentation ( after furious bartering with the other plaintiffs , he got thirty-nine of the sixty available minutes ) . It was Cutler , however , who sat at the defense team 's nerve center  --  listening , taking notes , passing on notes , f  --  te- ? - thing with Pickering , coordinating all troop 's , a legal general behind the front lines . Few battles are conclusively decisive , and neither was this one . Like a judicious Solomon , the court agreed with Ford , Chrysler and American Motors that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 's test dummies , and hence tests , had been " unobjective " ; therefore it delayed any standard until new tests were run . But , on the other hand , the decision stated that the agency did have the authority to require the installation of such new technology . Although they lost this key contention , ' the U.S. ( and foreign ) auto men did secure a delay in the date of air bag installation . The industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for air bags . As of now air bags will not be installed in all new cars until 1984 . ? The Editors All this delay , of course , had a deadly cost , best understood by a simple , though persuasive syllogism : real world crashes of experimental cars with air bags showed that some drivers would have been killed if their cars had lacked air bags ; these delays , then ; effectively prevent millions of passengers from gaining the benefits of air bags ; therefore , thousands of people will needlessly die in auto crashes . The Department of Transportation estimated in August 1974 that equipping all cars with air bags would save 15,600 lives a year and result in one million fewer injuries . Industry objection to air bags fits easily into a long tradition : when a health or safety breakthrough threatens industry investment and planning , it is opposed . It is as predictable as a law of physics : shatterproof windshield glass , functional bumpers , seat belts , antipollution exhaust devices and air bags were all initially fought by the auto makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Lloyd Cutler , who in the executive , Congressional and judicial branches of government exploited his considerable talents to avoid or delay these life-saving advances . Lawyers in such circumstances often escape culpability for the societal consequences of , their acts by pointing out that they were merely following client orders . Cutler , however , can not and does not use this rationale . Rather , he argues that if air bags were prematurely installed in 1974 models , and they misfired , it would generate consumer hostility . Like many arguments , this one appears plausible ; it is not for nothing that Lloyd Cutler earns more than $250,000 annually . But his argument is because even G.M. had decided the air bag was workable , and in 1972 was planning to offer 50,000 new cars with air bags beginning in the fall of 1973 . What is good enough for G.M. engineering should be good enough for Cutler . But he supported instead a - client ( Ford ) who did n't believe in air bags , even though his other client ( G.M. ) did . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen , Mr. Green . There is one point I want to make clear : we believe in the arguments that we make . " . ?
