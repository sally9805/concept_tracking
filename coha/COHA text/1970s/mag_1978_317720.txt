Tension , zigzags and a battle over energy <P> Although the major battle in Congress last week was over taxes , Senators and Representatives also had to fight their way through a bewildering array of measures . " I 've voted enough today , " snapped Democrat Barbara Jordan of Texas as she hobbled off the House floor on a cane at 11 o'clock one night . Admitted Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd one evening : " I 'm so tired that I ca n't remember whether this motion is debatable . " <P> Roll-call buzzers sounded repeatedly in both chambers . Aides gathered in corridors and hallways for hurried conferences with then-bosses . Pages scurried about , notifying Senators and Representatives of phone calls from powerful lobbyists , White House aides and even the President . Periodically , Democratic or Republican leaders rushed frantically onto the House and Senate floors to keep wavering supporters in line on key votes . <P> Members had to vote on legislation touching on an enormous variety of subjects , from Nobel prizewinners to evidence in rape cases , from drug addicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly knew what they were voting on . Said New York Republican Senator Jacob Javits : " I do n't know about anyone else , but I 'm chaotic . " <P> Rivalling the intensity of the fight over taxes was the struggle over the energy bill . In the House , Speaker Tip O'Neill ran into unexpected trouble on energy with the House Rules Committee . He wanted to have the legislation , which comprised five separate bills , voted on as a single package . This way , he reasoned , House members would be less vulnerable to pressure against gas deregulation from a formidable array of lobbyists , ranging from representatives of large corporations to Environmentalist James Plug . <P> <P> O'Neill 's strategy had to be approved first by the Rules Committee . After a night of debate , the committee was deadlocked , 8 to 8 . O'Neill and Administration strategists then focused their efforts on California Democrat B.F. Sisk , who had voted against the merged bill . Despite a 15-min. call from Jimmy Carter , Sisk refused to change his vote . <P> Thereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . They played on Sisk 's reluctance to be seen as the man who killed the energy bill and promised to fix problems of water reclamation and supply in his district . When the vote was taken again on Friday , it was 9 to 5 in favor of a single bill , with Sisk voting in the majority and two other Representatives in effect abstaining . A few hours later , the House went along with the committee by the narrowest of margins , 207 to 206 . <P> In the Senate , Democrat James Abourezk of South Dakota , a diehard opponent of natural gas deregulation , mounted a one-man filibuster that delayed the final vote for three days . Even after a 71-to-13 cloture vote , Abourezk , who is retiring from the Senate this year , obstinately continued his filibuster , causing Majority Leader Byrd to slump red-faced with anger in his chair . Abourezk , with a handful of supporters , kept talking for 15 hours , then gave up . Hours later , the bill passed , by 60 to 17 in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
