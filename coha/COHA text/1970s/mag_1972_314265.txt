THE Governor 's race in Missouri is a headline writer 's ideal of brevity : Dowd v. Bond . But even more , it fascinates political editors , who wonder whether a young , rich , handsome , Establishment-educated reformer can defeat an entrenched Democratic machine that has held the governorship since 1944 . Chances are that he might , judging from campaign performances so far by Christopher ( " Kit " ) Bond , 33 . <P> Bond has family wealth and other advantages : he is **30;2117;TOOLONG of Virginia , but he speaks with a noticeable Missouri twang . Wife Carolyn , a slim brunette with a Phi Beta Kappa key and a master 's degree in guidance and counseling , campaigns along with her husband . Working the middle of the road Bond persuaded both Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan to stump for him . <P> Bond 's best asset , however , is the solid issue of mismanagement and the Democratic machine . Elected state auditor two years ago , he set out to investigate state and county offices that in some cases had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly discovered , for example , that thousands of license plates had vanished , presumably to be sold illegally . <P> Using a chartered two-engine Piper Seneca , Bond has crisscrossed Missouri since he handily won the G.O.P. primary , speaking on " the mess in Jefferson City " to factory workers and college students , and appearing at professional lunches and $3-a-plate dinners . He also plugs for penal reform , more women in state government , and lighter penalties on marijuana users . <P> Against such a barrage , Democratic Candidate Edward L. Dowd , 54 , has found himself on the defensive in a strongly Democratic state . Dowd , a onetime FBI agent and St. Louis police board president , has so far found little to campaign on except his law-and-order record . Other than that , he belittles his opponent 's age with references to " Kid " Bond . <P> Nixon , who won Missouri by only 20,000 votes in 1968 , will certainly do much better this year . This ought to help Bond , although Missouri voters are notable vote splitters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bond either way . If he wins , he becomes the nation 's youngest Governor . If he loses , he has already attracted so much attention that he is being talked up as Stuart Symington 's 1976 senatorial opponent .
