If you hear that federal financing of political campaigns is far off , do n't believe it . The next general election for President probably will be paid for by the US Treasury ? if if Congress does not change present law and does , sometime between now and September 1976 , appropri ? ate the $43 million or more that almost certainly will be checked off income tax returns under the nearly forgotten one-dollar checkoff law that first was approved in 1966 . During the recent flurry in Congress over campaign reform , when efforts to broaden federal finandng were beiten back , the existence of Senator Russell Long 's checkoff plan was somehow forgotten , perhaps because it was so easily sus ? pended , for the 1968 and 1972 elections . There is new life in the plan , however , in part due to the Watergate-Agnew scandals , and also be ? cause inflation has hit electioneering harder than it has hit house ? keeping . The exorbitant cost of campaigning has nurtured the belief that if you 're not a multimillionaire or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief is ultimately intolerable , even to cynics . The checkoff plan is a compromise between those who want to continue the old system of private donations and those who are pushing in the op ? posite direction ? complete federal subsidy not only for the presiden ? tial general election , but for House and Senate races and for all primaries as well . How does the checkoff work ? Taxpayers are given an opportunity to mark a box on their returns ? one dollar for each individual , two dollars per joint return . Originally taxpayers could also designate the party to which their money would go . That idea was dropped by an amendment last year and now all the designations are dumped in one pot . In 1975 and perhaps again in early 1976 , Congress will be obliged to appropriate funds in the pot , and the money will be placed in a presidential campaign fund account within the Treasury Department . After the two major parties nominate their presidential candidates and any minor parties do whatever is necessary to qualify their nomi ? nees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date is to be given , based on the number of nominees and the amount available and appropriated by Congress . Under the law that amount is limited to 15 cents per eligible voter or a total of about $21 million for each major presidential candidate , less for minor or new party candidates . The comptroller general having certified the legally quali ? fied candidates , the full presidential fund would be divided within the Treasury Department into accounts for each . Beginning September 1 , 1976 ? or after nomi ? nation and certification ? candidates could begin sub ? mitting paid bills to the comptroller general , who will check them to be certain the expenditures were legiti ? mately part of the general election campaign . He will send them to the Treasury for reimbursement , and then the secretary of the Treasury will pay each candi ? date from the account established for him . This reim ? bursement procedure will be followed throughout the election period and 30 days thereafter , though each major party candidate can get only up to $21 million . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minor parties are squeezed , being limited to what they can receive by their vote in prior elections . Major party candidates are given a choice either of taking the $21 million from the Treasury , or trying to raise that amount ? or more ? from private donors . Those who choose the federal subsidy have to have some cash to get started , since the Treasury money only comes as reimbursement after they have paid their bills . And once they go the public financing route , they can not solicit any additional private funds . In the past there has been some question as to whether enough people will check the box on their in ? come tax form to accumulate the amount needed . In 1972 , when it was necessary to complete a separate form to collaborate in the program , only 2.5 million of the 78.5 million taxpayer returns participated in the checkoff . With most of those coming from joint re ? turns , about four million dollars was earmarked . Now , largely as a result of a Common Cause lawsuit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first page of every 1973 tax return form . Also , a special second line has been added to the tax form , giving those who ignored the box last year another chance . With substantial publicity and the two check ? off lines printed on page one of all forms , sufficient amounts should be available well before 1976 . Limited as it is to the general election of the Presi ? dent , the checkoff plan in 1976 will provide a prelimi ? nary test of the effects of public financing on the plan ? ning and budgeting of campaigns and the extent to which the subsidies liberate nominees from indebted ? ness to private interests . Also to be tested will be the new comprehensive reportihg laws , requiring anyone seeking the nomination to put on public record ? from the day his candidacy is organized ? both his contri ? butions and expenditures . Furthermore , should the House approve a Senate bill passed earlier this year , candidates will be limited in the amounts they can spend before the nominations , and individual donors will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only two candidates , RepubliCan and Democratic , are likely to be important in the next general election for l3resident , so expenditures and receipts will be fairly easy to monitor . Since only the general electionis covered , the federal subsidy is not likely to have much effect on the selection of candidates at conven ? tions or on pre-convention campaigning . As noted , once nominated , the candidates themselves will de ? cide whether to take the public money or to go the tra ? ditional private fund-raising route . It is possible that one candidate might run with private donations , another with federal funds , which would at least pro ? vide a comparative test of systems . In all cases , however , candidates seeking their own party 's nomination through state primary races or other delegate selection processes will have to rely on private contributors . To advocates of broader public financing this is a major flaw in the checkoff law . They likewise want to expand federal payments to House and Senate primary and general elections , a wish that was frustrated earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that debate Allen said pub ? licly what sitting senators and representatives know privately ? that public financing for them would invite primary and general election opponents that many in ? cumbents have never encountered in the past , because potential challengers could not raise the same kind of money that is usually available to those who hold power . Many legislators suddenly had a disconcerting vision of how public funds might sharply alter the party nomination system , putting money into the hands of heretofore marginal or even frivolous candi ? dates . In the House the legislators reacted by cutting out the provisions that dealt with congressional elec ? tions . In the Senate the inability to get enough votes to close down the Allen filibuster reflected another reali ? zation ? that the wider public financing being pro ? posed could shatter the traditional presidential nomi ? nation process . The Senate decided the plan needed more study , which it now will get from the Rules Committee . As part of the agreement to end the fili ? buster , that group will report out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached in Congress , this one with Rep. Wayne Hays , the feisty chairman of the House Administration Committee . Under pressure from the Democratic leadership , Hays promised to bring out a campaign fund bill in February . Since last summer he has kept bottled up in committee the Senate measure setting new limits on private contri ? butions and expenditures by both candidates and political committees . The Senate bill also would estab ? lish a bipartisan federal elections commission to en ? force the campaign fund laws ? removing that function from a Justice Department controlled by the political leader of one party in the elections . Hays has been a strong opponent of all such reforms , along with any proposed public financing measure . As yet there ig no indication of what type of bill Hays plans to report out . At a recent meeting of his committee he polled the members on their views . The form of the session gives some idea of how Hays works . By making it an in DECEMBER 22 , 1973 formal meeting the chairman was able to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal position . For anyone seeking his party 's presidential nomina ? tion in 1976 , the rules will not be what they were in 1972 . A candidate will have.to report his earliest ex ? penses and campaign income ? even expenses incurred well before the election year . Thus if Nelson Rocke ? feller , Ronald Reagan , Charles Percy , Henry Jackson , Walter Mondale or Edward Kennedy set up skeletal campaign organizations in 1974 to test the political waters during the midterm congressional campaigns , those organizations will have to report . Because of that , some are already planning their initial fund-raising around hundreds of $3000 donors rather than around a handful of $50,000 fat cats .. One ca n't rule out the possibility of the Senate 's passing next spring a public financing proposal that broadens the present checkoff law . But our hunch is that the House - would not go along and instead would approve some version of the earlier Senate bill placing limits on private fund-raising and campaign expendi ? tures . It would then be up to the House-Senate confer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be is anyone 's guess . Ours would be that the present checkoff law would survive , setting the stage for a test of taxpayer-supported presidential elections in 1976 .. The public has been told that total public financing is the remedy for political corruption . If that were true remedial legislation would zip through Congress . But in fact no one is sure what public financing will do to elections and particularly to the pre-nomination prac ? tices that are associated with selection of congressional and presidential candidates . Furthermore , there has been little serious exploration of these questions by Congress or by the news media . During the latest cam ? paign reform debates , press and television correspond ? ents gave only superficial coverage to the discussion , directing most of their attention to tactics rather than ? substance . The New York Times , for example , published a detailed analysis of the presidential public financing proposal the day after the , debate ended . Both the Times and The Washington Post editorialized against Republicans who supported the Allen filibuster , im ? plying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet neither paper , nor Time , mentioned the checkoff law already on the books . We cite these examples only to underline the fact that one reason agitation for reform in the past has done so little to make the system honest is that neither the press nor the public cares much about what hap ? ' pens from one scandal to the next . If campaign financ ? ing , whether with public or private money , is to be ? come a general concern of all citizens , as it should , the news media will have to report more diligently on how campaigns are now paid for ? and not just campaigns where improprieties are alleged.7 Trucks &; Trains If they encouraged no one else , the truck blockades of December must have cheered the radicals who have been predicting for years that workers and students were about to unite and throw off the chains of capitalism . It was strange to see those solid Middle Americans , the heavy tractor-truck men , demon ? strating and calling press conferences just as antiwar activists did not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried but failed to achieve . They said they were going to block traffic in Washington , DC and shut down the government . When antiwar demonstrators tried that on May Day 1971 , they got nowhere because the government 's counterstrategy had been worked out so well in advance . The President 's law ' n ' order deputies , John Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst , had the local police use mass arrests without warrants to sweep up and detain more than 10,000 marchers and by ? standers . There were some constitutional problems with this , it turned out later , but the tactics did keep the streets clear . The truckers ' protest has been deflected more easily . After several spontaneous blockades of interstate highways in Ohio , Pennsylvania and Maryland , some angry truckers announced they were going to make themselves felt in Washington . But the siege has n't taken place . The administration moved quickly to assure the truckers that it was eager to hear about their problems . President Nixon met personally with the president of the Teamsters Union , Frank Fitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposed White House energy chief , John Love , says he never spoke with the President for this long in his six months on the jqb . ) Another meeting was arranged between a delegation of truckers headed by their unofficial leader , " River Rat " ( J. W. Edwards ) , and the secretary of Transportation , Claude Brinegar . From Brinegar they received a solemn promise that he would " re ? examine the priorities of diesel fuel allocation " and reconsider the 55 mile per hour highway speed limits favored by the President . To help satisfy the demand for immediate action the Internal Revenue Service made a survey of 850 truck stops and found that more than a quarter of them were charging inflated , illegal prices for diesel . Most of the violators were forced to lower their rates . Miraculously this seems to have taken the steam out of the resistance and spared the administration an ugly confrontation . No one knows what might have happened if the President had been forced to call out the national guard to stop the truckers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies are short . The American Trucking Association says that its survey indicates the price of diesel fuel has risen more than 30 percent this year
