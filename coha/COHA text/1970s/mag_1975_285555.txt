On Monday morning , Jan. 6 , less than a week after William O. Douglas had suffered a stroke , the eight other Justices met sadly in the Supreme Court building . Personal reactions aside , they were faced with serious problems posed by Douglas ' absence . The Justices decided to delay hearing arguments on five cases . Each one was picked not so much for its importance , but because without Douglas the others feared a tie vote that would render high-court consideration meaningless ; it would simply leave a lower-court decision in effect . <P> This week the court will begin hearing four of those cases instead of waiting for the senior Justice 's return . The change in plans came when Douglas ' colleagues learned that , although he is now on the " satisfactory " list at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , his recovery has been slower than expected . He will be off the bench until at least March , and perhaps a great deal longer . <P> " It was decided to let the chips fall where they may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good practice , but it 's the best the court can do under the circumstances . " In the past two weeks Douglas has been able to spend one to three hours a day with his secretary , working on cases that were argued before he was hospitalized and on some routine new work . But he will not participate in any new cases for the time being . Nor will he handle all the hundreds of in forma pauperis petitions that many prisoners and indigents address personally to him-now often with the request that they be forwarded to the hospital . <P> Doctors believe that the stroke did not affect Douglas ' intellect . His vision , temporarily impaired , is now back to normal , and he reads mail his wife Cathleen , 31 , brings daily . His speech is improving markedly , though there are still traces of slurring . A slight drooping of the left side of his face persists . His left arm has responded somewhat to whirlpool baths and manipulation therapy , but it is still not usable ( Douglas is right-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of response . TIME has learned that his physicians now think it possible that the great outdoorsman will never walk again . <P> Iron Will . Associates remember that in 1949 , when his horse fell on him , crushing 23 of his 24 ribs , Douglas was undaunted : he was back on the bench six months later . In childhood he confounded doctors ' expectations that his polio-stricken legs would forever be useless . In addition , Douglas knows that a Ford-nominated successor might well tip the court into pronounced conservativism , a result that would seem a disaster to the old liberal . <P> Nonetheless , the longest-sitting Justice in Supreme Court history is 76 , and his physical handicaps are clearly greater than originally thought . The court is now prepared to settle in and operate without Douglas until he determines whether to return or retire . " I 've known Douglas a long time , " says one friend . " He 's got an iron will and may never quit . But he 's also very proud , and might find it difficult to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was-when he ca n't walk onto the bench on his own power .
