THE COWBOYS <P> Directed by MARK RYDELL <P> Screenplay by IRVING RAVETCH , HARRIET FRANK JR . and WILLIAM DALE JENNINGS <P> Wil Anderson , on the sunset side of 50 , has to get his herd of cattle to market . The hands he hired for the drive ran out on him when they heard about the gold strike upriver . There is not a man left in the territory to help him , so Wil turns to boys-eleven eager , callow youngsters . He teaches them a little about roping and riding trail . He hires a black man named Jebediah Nightlinger to tend the chuck wagon . Then , uneasy with the entire proposition , he sets off . <P> The Cowboys sounds like a natural . Good premise , good Southwest locations , and John Wayne . Things go wrong , though , because of Mark Rydell 's lallygagging direction and a remarkably inept , even vicious script . <P> In this moppet Red River , it is the Duke 's responsibility to nudge the boys to manhood . This involves him not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapist . He cures one of the kids of a bad stutter by riling him until the boy can call Duke half a dozen kinds of a son of a bitch without a single stumble . <P> When the bad guys show up , things really fly to pieces . A grubby band of desperadoes led by Bruce Dern ( in a splendidly bravura performance ) want in on the drive and the profits . Duke shoos them off , but they skulk along behind the cows , waiting to make a move . When they do , Dern and Duke mix it up , and Dern finally gets the best of it . Aided by Nightlinger ( Roscoe Lee Browne ) , the kids vow vengeance . <P> Ultimately The Cowboys suggests that you are not a man until you have murdered . These children dispatch Dern in an act of outright sadism all the more chilling for its apparent dispassion . Yet Rydell and the screenwriters seem to be congratulating them on their new-found machismo . The Cowboys is no investigation of the inherent evil of the young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor does it have the awful irony of Peckinpah 's Straw Dogs ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) , in which heroism turned into savagery . Here savagery is seen as heroism . <P> The ever-fallible Motion Picture Association of America rated The Cowboys GP ( all ages permitted , parental discretion advised ) , and Warner Brothers is pushing it as a swell movie for the whole family .
