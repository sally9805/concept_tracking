CORPORATIONS End of a Family Fight <P> Like a child torn by a parental custody fight , Genesco , the sprawling retail and apparel concern , rocked back and forth for years in a war for control between two strong-willed personalities : W. Maxey Jarman and his son Franklin . In the end both lost . Four years ago , Franklin , now 45 , ousted his father as company head and set about stripping Genesco of unprofitable businesses that Maxey had acquired in an unsuccessful attempt to expand sales to $2 billion a year . ( They are about half that now . ) Then , last week , Franklin himself was bounced in a coup organized over the New Year 's holiday by his two chief subordinates and four outside directors ( Maxey , now 72 and no longer a director , apparently took no part ) . <P> Franklin remains chairman of the company that his grandfather , James Franklin Jarman , founded 52 years ago . But he was succeeded as president and chief executive by William Blackie , 72 , a former executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the company temporarily while the ten directors search for a permanent chief . The board announced that Franklin Jarman would have only such duties as Blackie assigned to him , and Blackie said that he could not think of anything that he wanted Jarman to do . <P> Numbers Man . Franklin seems to have fallen victim to his own attempts to bring more scientific management to the diverse , largely fashion-oriented ( Henri Bendel , Bonwit Teller ) business . Jarman , a numbers man who carries an elaborate pocket calculator , lopped off several divisions , including San Remo men 's suits and I. Miller women 's shoes , and slashed 10,000 employees from the payroll . The surgery alienated the heads of many of Genesco 's 78 operating divisions , who resented Jarman 's lack of merchandising expertise . Some grumbled that Jarman " ran a fashion business as though it were a bank . " <P> For a while , however , Jarman 's ap proach seemed to work : in the fiscal year that ended last July , Genesco recorded a $16 million profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as staff morale plummeted and consumer spending flattened out , profits turned downward again and Genesco 's creditors became worried about their loans ( the company had to refinance $70 million in debt that fell due in November ) . Stockholders bridled when Jarman announced at the annual meeting in December that Genesco would pay them no dividends before 1978 . Common shareholders have received nothing since 1973 , and Genesco is behind in dividend payments on preferred stock . Shareholders also complained angrily that , while the company was paying no common dividends , Jarman 's salary had been raised by $105,000 a year , to $285,000.
