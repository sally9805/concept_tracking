For years 18th century Italian painting has been one of art history 's orphans : the general supposition was that after 1650 , Italian art slid into provincial decadence . From this sad landscape , littered with insignificant talents fit only for doctoral theses or bourgeois mantels , a few fine painters emerged : Tiepolo , Canaletto , Guardi , a handful of others . Giovanni-Battista Tiepolo , in fact , seems in retrospect to have been the last Italian artist formed in the heroic mold . A protean figure of bewildering facility and adaptability , he was the link between high historical painting and rococo elegance , able to invest a pen drawing with as much tension and airy scale as a painted ceiling . But generally the 18th century seemed to be Anglo-French territory : Italy 's long moment of cultural supremacy had gone , the locus of energy shifted . <P> Mercifully , events are never so pat , and in the past few years , more and more attention has been given to this phase of Italian art . The renewal of interest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century : Rococo to Romanticism , " a collection of 104 paintings by 81 artists , now at the Toledo Museum of Art . Concurrently , New York 's Metropolitan Museum is mounting a large show of drawings by the same masters . <P> Taste Like Burrs . In Italy , the 18th century resisted generalization . Florentine painting had collapsed , never to revive , and activity was split among several centers : Rome , Venice , Turin , Bologna and Naples . There was no broad direction of style . The artists worked more and more outside Italy , pursuing foreign commissions and coming back with the seeds of foreign taste sticking to them like burrs . As a result , the range of the period was astonishing ; it ran from Magnasco 's turbid compositions of raggedy monks to the grandeur and sun-washed transparency of Tiepolo 's Armida Abandoned by Rinaldo , from Pier-Leone Ghezzi 's wry grotesqueries and exact social observation to the flaccid but competent imitations of French classical landscape turned out by such artists as Orizzonte . For the first time , Italian artists had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paradise of cultural self-sufficiency ; they depended , as their Renaissance and Baroque forebears had never needed to , on the outside market .
