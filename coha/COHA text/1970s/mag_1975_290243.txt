Standing stiffly on the flag-draped dais in Mexico City 's Olympic Gymnasium was a small platoon of male bigwigs , including United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim , Mexican President Luis Echeverria and various other officials . Down on the floor , masses of women draped in saris , ao-dais and other colorful garb listened more or less attentively as the men spoke . That strange beginning for a conference on women marked a meeting that is supposed to be the biggest of its kind in history-the centerpiece of the U.N . ' s much-ballyhooed , much-disputed International Women 's Year . <P> At a press conference earlier , a group of mostly female journalists fairly exploded at what they saw as the incongruity of the situation . A U.N . press officer announced that the conference president would be available for an interview after " he " was elected . " What do you mean ' he ' ? " the women protested . " Well , I mean person , " stammered the flustered officer . " O.K. , let 's call it ' it . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a male : Pedro Ojeda , Mexico 's Attorney General . <P> Launching Pad . Some 1,044 U.N . delegates , most of whom were women , and 5,000 other assorted feminists and interested spectators poured into macho Mexico for what was billed by planners as " the world 's largest consciousness-raising group . " The consciousness-raisers present included one female Prime Minister , Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka , and about a dozen wives of national leaders , promptly dubbed " wifey-poos " by disdainful feminists . Among them : Jehan Sadat of Egypt , Nusrat Bhutto of Pakistan , Leah Rabin of Israel , and Imelda Marcos of the Philippines . <P> Those who made the trip found that attending the meetings was no easy matter . The official U.N . proceedings took place at the Foreign Ministry on the north side of the city . In the Medical Center five miles away was a separate U.N.-sponsored but nongovernmental " Tribune " -a more free-wheeling forum set up for representatives of organizations ranging from the National Gay Task Force of the U.S. to the Federation of Cuban Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two sites involved a harrowing half-hour taxi trip through tangled traffic ; many women complained that the conference planners had deliberately separated the meeting sites so as to keep radical feminists from upsetting the polite , official proceedings . <P> A major goal of the official conference is to draft a ten-year plan of action for member nations that will stress better health care and education for women and their increased participation in government . Yet global politics seemed to be the main preoccupation , at least at the outset . Mexico 's President Echeverria opened the proceedings by calling for a redistribution of world wealth and political power to bring about a " new international order . " The International Women 's Year could not make good on its promise of peace , declared Mrs. Sadat , " while Arab lands remain occupied , while the Palestinians remain homeless . " Russian Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova , head of the Soviet delegation , extolled her country to reporters as " the great exception as far as opportunity for women is concerned .
