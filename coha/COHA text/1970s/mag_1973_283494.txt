Employers who hope to conceal such impending changes as layoffs , work cutbacks and personnel shifts might just as well give up : the word will get to their employees on the company grapevine . So concludes Keith Davis , a professor of management at Arizona State University , who has been studying office and factory rumors for 20 years . " With the rapidity of a burning powder train , " Davis asserts , " information flows out of the woodwork , past the manager 's door and the janitor 's mop closet , through steel walls or construction-glass partitions . " Moreover , " well over three-fourths " of company rumors are accurate . <P> According to Davis , people underestimate the reliability of the grapevine because its misses are more dramatic than its hits . That was the case , Davis says , when a factory grapevine reported that a worker had lost his hand in a machine-shop accident ; in fact he had suffered only minor cuts on two fingers . <P> But even inaccurate scuttlebutt may convey a psychological truth , because many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If rumor says that Joe is quitting , this may mean that his associates wish he would quit , " or it may reflect a general-but sometimes unconscious-awareness that Joe desperately wishes he could quit . <P> Whether it spreads truth or falsehood , whether it transmits " smoke signals , jungle tom-toms , taps on the prison wall or ordinary conversation , " a grapevine is bound to develop wherever people congregate . But employers can keep false rumormongering at a minimum by telling the truth and telling it early . Increasingly , Davis reports , wise managers are trying " to feed , water and cultivate the grapevine " themselves . <P> They may as well , Davis concludes , because the grapevine " can not be abolished , rubbed out , hidden under a basket , chopped down , tied up or stopped . <P> It is as hard to kill as the mythical glass snake which , when struck , broke into fragments and grew a new snake out of each piece .
