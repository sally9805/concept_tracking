NEW YORK , NEW YORK Directed by MARTIN SCORSESE Screenplay by EARL MAC RAUCH and MARDIK MARTIN <P> Maybe Santayana had it wrong after all . " Those who can not remember the past , " he said , " are condemned to repeat it . " But in movieland , it is those who can remember the past who seem to feel compelled to repeat it . In New York , New York , Director Martin Scorsese recalls the big-band era . His is not the actual historical period , of course ; on V-J day , 1945 , when the film begins , Scorsese was two , and Scriptwriter Earl Mac Rauch , who devised the original story , was not yet born . What Scorsese is evoking is an epoch of moviemaking : the heyday of lavish studio musicals . <P> The terraced nightclubs , the carmine-lipped girls with padded shoulders , the hokey production number with the star swiveling down an immense abstract staircase-they 're all here . But why ? Half the time Scorsese is sending them up , and the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend of unearned nostalgia . <P> Studied Unreality . If this movie were a big-band arrangement , it would be a duet for a sax man and a girl singer , but with the soloists in a different key from the band . Smack in the midst of the gold-tinsel snowfalls and the studied unreality of the sound stages , Scorsese spins out a naturalistic , contemporary-feeling melodrama about a love affair that goes sour . <P> The effect is disjointed from the opening sequence , a frenzied victory celebration in a skyscraper nightclub where Tommy Dorsey 's orchestra is doing a radio spot . Unemployed Sax Player Jimmy Doyle ( Robert De Niro ) , on a spree in his sporty new civvies , picks up ex-U.S.O . Singer Francine Evans ( Liza Minnelli ) in an ill-paced scene that is lumbered with flat , witless dialogue ( " Give me your phone number . " " No . " <P> " Yes . " " No . " " Yes . " ) . Francine con ceives an exasperated fondness for him , gets him a job in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As the 1940s wane , so do the bands . <P> The singers , boosted by the burgeoning record industry , become stars . Jimmy drifts disconsolately into jazz gigs in Harlem , while Francine heads for the top of the charts and Hollywood . Their marriage can not survive . Jimmy splits on the day Francine bears their child . <P> De Niro brings formidable energy and intensity to Jimmy 's goofball streak , his sulks , his frustrated rage . But the rea son such a character , as written , should interest us remains as elusive as the Lost Chord . De Niro is unable to move the role beyond the capsule description by the bandleader ( played by Big Band Vet eran Georgie Auld , who also supplies the sax solos on the sound track ) who first hires Jimmy . " Jimmy plays a barrelful of sax , " says the leader , " but he 's a top pain in the ass . " <P> As Francine , Minnelli is wholesome , glib , plucky - more a familiar manner than a characterization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy , there is a sense in her performance of counting the choruses till her next solo . Indeed , the latter half of the film moves toward her virtual apotheosis in a series of climactic production numbers . Their impact depends on how you feel about Liza 's nightclub act .
