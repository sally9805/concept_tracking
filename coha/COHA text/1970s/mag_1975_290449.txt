Every revolution has its pamphleteer . America 's latest rebel crusade-for the legalization of marijuana-has inevitably produced its own pamphleteer , of sorts , a cause-and-cash-oriented , superglossy bimonthly called High Times . Pot has already been " decriminalized " in five states , and several others are expected to follow . So the magazine at $1.50 per copy ( $8 for ten issues ) , has had a heady time in its first year . It has shot from a claimed circulation of 25,000 to 300,000 in its current issue . Its 20 youthful staffers-many of them refugees from straight publications like Good Housekeeping-work out of a large loft in Manhattan . Editorially , High Times has so far ranged all the way from the bizarre to the benumbed . One early issue ran a far-out , unverified , unsigned account of President John Kennedy " turning on " to alleviate his back troubles ( " I Was Kennedy 's Dealer " ) . Later issues have come down to more clear-eyed and believable fare , including pieces on the medical effects of drugs , roundups on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices in the U.S. and abroad . <P> Broader Appeal . Despite its growing sobriety , the question recurs whether High Times is not in fact encouraging lawbreaking when it advertises itself as " devoted entirely to the exploration of psychoactive drugs . " However , hip-casual Editor Ed Dwyer , 27 , formerly with Coronet , draws a careful distinction . Says he : " We support the legalization of marijuana , but we never advocate the use of it . We report on its use and the interesting facts associated with altering consciousness , but we do not lead our readers into drugs . Everybody must decide by himself . It 's a personal thing . " <P> The five national-magazine distributors have boycotted High Times . Publisher-Owner Andrew Kowal , 24 , is unperturbed . A Syracuse University dropout , Kowal says the magazine has been successfully marketed through boutiques and head-shops , which are also major advertisers , and through local distributors . Only a small number , 9,000 , are mail subscriptions . Kowal predicts a 400,000 press run for the next issue : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says slyly , " but we will go as high as we can . " <P> Still , a single-cause magazine can come down as fast as it goes up . Concerned but bullish , Editor Dwyer plans to broaden High Times ' appeal to include the clothes , food and homelife of the pot generation , and investigative stories on the drug agencies . Says Dwyer : " Our audience is optimistic and pleasure-oriented . We 're putting it all together for this readership . "
