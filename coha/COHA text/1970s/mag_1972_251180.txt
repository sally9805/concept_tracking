DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER <P> Directed by GUY HAMILTON <P> Screenplay by RICHARD MAIBAUM and <P> TOM MANKIEWICZ <P> This , the seventh movie in the James Bond canon ( the heretical Casino Royale , which postulated a horde of 007s instead of one , does n't count ) , is in some ways the best of the lot . It is by all odds the broadest-which is to say wackiest , not sexiest . Indeed , the ladies of sinister sexuality ( Jill St. John , Lana Wood ) look like randy and overweight cheerleaders beside the likes of Domino and Pussy Galore . They furnish 007 with a few pleasant pit stops , but the real adventure lies elsewhere . <P> Bond is on the trail of that arch-meanie , Ernst Stavros Blofeld ( Charles Gray ) , and a ring of high-placed diamond smugglers who operate in Las Vegas . Somehow mixed up in all this are an eccentric millionaire recluse ( hello there , Howard Hughes ) , a wizened stand-up comic , a crooked mortician , a couple of campy killers named Wint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thumper . They strike a gymnastic blow for Women 's Lib by effortlessly bouncing Bond , the sexist pig , off the four walls of a luxurious desert hideaway . <P> With its laser machines , fights to the death and exotic homicides , Diamonds Are Forever is like a Looney Tune . A chaotic car chase through the streets of downtown Las Vegas is the funniest scene of its kind since Roadrunner last boinked the coyote . <P> Bond seems to grow more resilient with age . Since 1962 and his first screen incarnation in Dr. No , several wars , untold natural disasters and the Beatles have all come and gone . Bond looks better than ever , partly because Sean Connery has returned to play him . During Connery 's one-picture absence , some fellow named Lazenby filled the role-the way concrete fills a hole . Connery , a fine , forceful actor with an undeniable presence , turns his well-publicized contempt for the Bond character into some wry moments of self-parody . He is capable of doing better things ( The Molly Maguires , Mamie ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perfect , the only James Bond . <P> ? Jay Cocks
