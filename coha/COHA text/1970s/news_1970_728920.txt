txt The whole hijacking was n't nice , but it was interesting and educational for me . I learned about the terrorists , the desert and Jordan as a whole . I had gone to Israel to visit relatives and to learn about the country and its traditions . I ended up getting more education than I expected . Sunday morning Sept. 6 I awoke at about 4 a. m. to go to Tel Aviv to board the plane that was to take me to the United States . I had been visiting near To Aviv , and now is was time to return to New York with stops at Athens , Greece , and Frankfurt , Germany . It must have been 40 minutes after we had left Frankfurt for New York when I heard someone shout back from the first class section . " Do n't move ! " he said . Yosef Trachtman , 10 , of 4721 N.

Everybody was looking at maps and trying to figure out where we might be going . No one wanted to go to - Beirut or Cairo . Then when we were over Beirut , the hijackers said we were going to Amman and that they were members of the Palestinian Popular Front . We were a little relieved that we were going to Amman rather than worse places and that the hijackers were an organized group rather than ? crazy individuals .

When the other terrorists came aboard the plane , many were girls who wore their hair short and had army uniforms with guns and boots . The men dressed the same . Restless and Frightened We were told that we would have to spend the night In the plane , and everybody was very restless and frightened , tho we had not been harmed . Nobody slept very much . I got two hours . Most of our guards were girls , and they argued with some of the passengers about the United States government and the war in Viet Nam . I did n't argue because I did n't want to upset them . I said I dis . agreed with them , but I did n't talk very much about it . ?

They gathered what was left over , and there was also some food from the Red Cross and the Palestinians . We had bread , cheese , eggs and water for breakfast , The desert was very hot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where it was cooler . We did n't walk around very much because wo did n't know how the Palestinians would like it , tho they seemed friendly . We still were confused as to what was going to happen . We knew they were going to ransom us for something , but we did n't know what . There were always about eight guards on the plane , and they stayed there all night . We were n't allowed out of the plane the first day , but wo got some vegetables and food , and I was given a piece of chocolate . Ransom for Sirhan Tho second day was much like the first . There was a rumor that we were being held in ransom for Sirhan Sirhnn , the man who shot Robert Kennedy . The people walked around more freely and sometimes talked and joked a little with the guerrillas . The third day we had meat for lunch  --  chicken and corn beef  --  and after lunch the guerrillas called all the Indian , Dutch , German and other people off the plane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the women and children would be allowed to go to Amman and then to go home . Put on Buses Later all of the remaining women and children were put on buses . Thoy were like school buses with hard seats . As soon as we had all gotten on , we were told to get off . Then they read off the names of those who were to get on again . All of them were non-Jewish , and I was n't included . Up to this time , tho they knew which of us were Jewish and which were not , it did n't matter . We were n't separated . They could tell easily I was Jewish because I wore my yarmulke all the time , Now there was a separation , and we were frightened . Those who were not called onto the bus went back to the plane for another night . Hostages Get Exercise Earlier that day we had exercised by walking around outside the plane while the guerrillas cleaned up the sanitary facilities , which were getting to be bad . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping for something . One of the teen-age girls could speak Arabic , and she asked them what had happened .

The people on the plane thought that the more people ems counLries represented , the safer they would be on the desert . It was n't that they were happy about another plane being hijacked , but they were sort of happy that there were more planes and people because that gave them more of a chance if there were morn countries involved . Leaving on a Jet Plane The teen - agers arranged some singing and games , and at night they sang songs that went " When Israel Was in Jordan Land " and " I 'm Leaving on a Jet Plano " and other songs that showed they were less afraid than they had been .

On Thursday the terrorists told us they were going to exchange us for other prisoners , one for one . Then Thursday night at midnight they took away 10 men without saying anything . All of them were Jewish . Many Say Prayers Then we were afraid . Some of the people cried quietly . Many said prayers quietly . Nothing like this had happened up to this time . This shocked me very much because it was n't expected . On Friday I played a game of geography with some adults . The food was better . We had canned food and vegetables and meat . About 7 p. m. the guerrillas came in and ordered all the men to get off the plane . Again there was no explanation . There were about 35 men , including the crew , who were taken away . The women were real upset . Everyone was . But there was no panic . 3 Seats for Everyone Friday night I had a lot of room . There were three seats for everyone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning , I had a cup of tea and then had to go to the front of the plane where they asked me some questions , mostly political . They asked me , " Do you believe that people should fight for their country ? " I answered , " Yes , if it is their country . " On Thursday they had taken all our luggage off the plane and after the questions they walked us down to see it . Anything from Israel , such as books or souveniers , they had taken out of the luggage . I lost about $8 worth of some Hebrew books and Israeli money , but the rest of the luggage I got to keep . After getting our luggage , we were loaded on buses to go to Amman . But the bus , I was on broke down on the way , and I finished my ride in an army Jeep on a bumpy road .

I was scared because there were n't any other people in the taxi except the Arab driver . Firelly two newsmen jumped d I was relieved . That night I hardly got any sleep . I felt much safer in the plane than in the hotel , but the next morning after breakfast we went to the airport . I got aboard a plane for Cyprus and arrived at 1 p. m. where there was much cheering and clapping . The next day we were on our way to New York and freedom at Inst . Tho I am now safe at home , I am still concerned for those who are still there .
