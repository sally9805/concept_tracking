Woe on Wall Street and tighter money , but maybe a stronger dollar too <P> Even by the standards of the 1970s , the decade of recurring recession , relentless inflation and repeated runs on the no longer almighty dollar , it was a wild week . For some time , Americans had seemed able to ignore or nimbly thrust out of mind repeated symptoms of their out-of-joint economy , like alarming new price rises and further drubbings of the greenback abroad . But last week those distant , or perhaps too familiar , woes hit home , and hard , in a burst of financial hysteria that engulfed markets , speculators and ordinary investors big and small from Wall Street to Main Street . <P> On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , where prices had generally been climbing through the year , brokers were swept up in a selling wave that caused pandemonium on Wall Street and twinges of fear throughout the country . In just five days , the market dive left investors with some $55 billion in paper losses and sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a week 's close of 838.99 . In terms of points , that was the Dow 's second steepest one-week decline ever ; during the week of Oct. 16 , 1978 , when prices were hammered by news of a sharply falling dollar abroad and worsening inflation at home , the Dow sank by a half point more , but on a much smaller volume of trading . The number of shares that changed hands last week , some 250 million , was the largest in Big Board history . <P> On Tuesday alone , the Dow dropped a breathtaking 26.45 points , its worst single-session loss since January 1974 , when the last recession was pushing the nation into its steepest economic slide since the Great Depression . The very next day , as worried investors around the country hurried to unload their falling stocks , a record 81.6 million shares were sold off on the Big Board in such a headlong rush that the ticker tape reporting transactions and prices fell as much as 63 minutes behind the pace of trading . " This thing is feeding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Wall Street brokerage house . " Each decline triggers another batch of people who have to sell . " <P> In other markets , there were similar cries of pain as huge price gyrations roiled trading in everything from metals and corporate bonds to livestock and even futures contracts for wheat and soybeans . In his office just off Chicago 's LaSalle Street , the heart of the Windy City 's financial district , Bond Trader Colin MacDonald paused long enough from juggling the phones on his Government securities desk to complain to a reporter that " the market 's in a shambles . Before this is over , there 'll be enough resignations from wiped-out traders to fill the Yellow Pages . " <P> On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a veteran trader emerged from a day of trying to cope with roller-coaster price changes in the pit where live cattle are traded to exclaim , " I 've never experienced anything like this in my life ! " In Florida , where the action this year in condominiums has been hotter than the summer sun , mortgage bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Miami savings and loan association : " People are asking , ' What 's going to happen tomorrow ? ' Everything has moved so quickly , no one can make any plans . "
