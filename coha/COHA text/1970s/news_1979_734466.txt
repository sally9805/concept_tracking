txt The House of Representatives tonight approved legislation to provide $5.9 billion in loans , loan guarantees and other fiscal assistance for companies in economically distressed areas . The bill , approved by a vote of 301 to 99 , also authorized a $2 billion standby local public works program for periods when the national unemployment rate reached 6.5 percent for at least one quarter of a year . The legislation , approved by the Senate last August , will now be sent to a HouseSenate conference to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions . The two-year loan and loan guarantee program originally was conceived by President Carter as an urban bank . Instead , Congress broadened the powers of the Economic Development Administration , authorizing the agency to aid companies seeking to renovate facilities in an economically distressed area or to move into such an area . New York would receive more than $140 million under the two-year program , while New Jersey would receive $54 million and Connecticut $20 million , according to a press spokesman for the economic development agency . Aiding Distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the House measure , is more highly selective in regard to those areas that would be eligible for the fiscal aid . Under the Senate bill , 67 percent of the country would be eligible for assistance , while the House bill would make 90 percent of the country eligible . President Carter submitted the legislation to Congress " to help strengthen the economic development of distressed urban and rural communities . " He said that the program would provide new jobs , strengthen the tax base of distressed communities and help their governments support essential public services without imposing high property taxes . The bill is intended to remedy the lack // of credit available to companies in economically distressed areas , especially concerns that are owned by members of minority groups and are of moderate size and only marginally profitable . High interest rates also reflect the perceived riskiness of both short- and longterm loans in those areas and add to the high cost of doing business in economically distressed areas . The House bill provides $1.8 billion in loan guarantees in the fiscal year 1980 and $2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 percent of the loans , reducing the risk of loss on the loan to the private lender and enabling the lender to charge a lower interest rate . The House bill also provides $191,430 in direct loans in the fiscal year 1980 , and $200,000 in 1981 . The loans would cover up to 75 percent of an applicant 's costs for fixed assets or working capital . In addition , interest-rate subsidies of $350,000 in 1980 and $600,000 in 1981 are provided . The subsidies would offset the difference between an interest rate of 4 percent and the Treasury rate . The legislation also provides funds for technical assistance grants to concerns to provide management assistance , feasibility studies and productivity analyses , as well as grants to defray up to 15 percent of the fixed asset costs of an eligible private sector project . The legislation was strongly supported by the Northeast-Middle Western Congressional coalition , which sent its members a letter today saying , " It has been documented that in the Northeast-Midwest region the birth rate of new firms is much lower than in other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of expansion is much lower in our region . " The letter called the program " a strategy to reverse economic decline in distressed areas through the private sector . " The letter noted , however , that " Unfortunately , this program is not targeted to areas of greatest distress . "
