IT WAS 0 . Yr.Y BY COINCIDENCE that my father ' arrived the week before I did . He had come East for the yearling auctions to advise a wealthy Mexi. can in the art of buying horses . The previous year the Mexican paid some $100,000 for a nineteenyear-old stallion and , horse longevity being roughly one-fourth of a man 's , there had been suggestions that he seek the advice of a horseman before continuing his speculations in equine bloodstock . That 's 11- hat my father was doing in Saratoga . I had seen him last in California . I drove up to the stable one morning early . When 1 got out of the car , the first thing my father said to me was , " You 're certainly wearing your hair long . " " I guess so . The effete East , you know . " " Well , if it gets any longer , " my father said , " you can stay in the East . " Then he apologized . " You 're grown now , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he looked at the ground a lot the rest of the weekend I was there . My father had already returned to California by the time I got to Saratoga . But it was almost as if he were still there . Everywhere I went , people told me that they 'd seen him and how w ell he looked . Six years ago my father set an all-time money-winning record as a trainer of thoroughbred horses . Led by two two-year-old champions ( Bold Lad and Queen Empress ) , his stable won nearly a million and a half dollars in purse money ( of which my father , as trainer , got roughly 10 per cent ) . Astounding to many , the next year he walked away from that same stable ? easily the best in the country ? citing personal reasons for his resignation . The wire services carried a blurb about Bill Winfrey " retiring " from racing at the age of fifty . He did n't retire though , and even today there is lingering speculation around the racetrack as to why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the job took too much time away from his family . I certainly never had any trouble believing that that was the real reason . Still , there were a lot of rumors that my father had not gotten along all that well with one of the stable 's owners . Ogden Phipps , a thoroughbred breeder , member of the Jockey Club , racing official , and one of the half-dozen or so most powerful men in American racing . AM NINE OR TEN YEARS OLD and deep asleep in I the still hour before dawn . In a little while my father will come and sit on the edge of my bed , rubbing my back slow and warm to wake me . But now I am dreaming : I am watching Les or John or one of the other grooms braid the tail of a gleaming chestnut colt , beautifying him for a race . / am sitting cross-legged at the door of the stall , listening to the soft , whispering psssssssss , psssssssss music the groom makes , exhaling , to keep the horse hairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upset . " The jock ca n't ride , " he announces to no one in particular . " We 'll have to scratch . " Now the dream gets a little hazy , But somehow , miraculously , there I am , splendidly annointed in racing silks , the whip in my right hand , the stirrups pulled so high my knees touch my hands . Now the dream is clear again . We are led into the starting gate . I hear my heart tharumping in my chest . " No chance , Mr. Cassidy , " 1 yell to the starter . Then my horse is still . The bell rings , the doors fly open , and with an incredible lurch that all but throws me from the saddle , we are off . I hit the colt three times with my whip , each time in stride ? barn , pause , barn , pause , barn ? just to get him going . We settle back for the stretch drive and I lean back holding him in , saving his speed , rating him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head for home , I begin to hear the roar in the grandstand . I am whipping again , now , as we pass horses on the outside , the colt and I moving as one . Now there is but one horse in front of me and , as I creep up on him it is all I can do to keep asleep for my inevitable , but still incredible ... Victory ... by a nose . Maybe a jockey was the only thing I ever really wanted to be . The thought occurs to me now , walking my father 's and grandfather 's paths here at Saratoga . Breathing this air that is a perfume of linament , pine , oats , straw , and , yes , manure , I am once again " Bill 's boy , " my father 's son , dependent on his praise for my solace , ready at his bidding to remount a frisky palomino that has just run off and thrown me . We would get up those mornings about 5:30 , my father and I , splashing cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the house so as not to disturb my mother . The streetlights would be haloed in the morning dew as we drove throuh near-deserted streets , the radio blaring Frankie Laine and " Mule Traaaaaaannin clippety clop-pin ' over hill and dale ... " We would sing to the radio , in tune only with each other . I would lean against my father 's warmth and never suspect t1 ' .1re was any other thing to be but happy . We 'd arrive at first light , and the first set of horses , half a dozen or so , would already be saddled . The exercise boys , seeing us arrive , would put down their coffees and get ready to get aboard their horses . I would walk down the long shed past two dozen horses in their stalls . It was a ritual my father insisted on ? saying good morning to the grooms and exercise boys who worked for him . " Good morning , ' Apples , ' " " Good morning , Harold . " Once the riders had mounted , the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I would follow my father on foot to the clocking stand , stopping with him along the way as he exchanged cheery small talk ( " You know my boy Carey " ) with the other trainers . The fact that I never managed to decipher it never prevented my enjoying the cryptic language of the dockers : " Twenty-two and two for the bay colt . What'ju get him in , Jack ? " By the time we 'd get hack to the stable , the grooms would have unsaddled the horses and would have started washing them . The exercise boys , each holding the shank of their mounts , would relive the workout , speaking the present-tense vernacular of race-trackese : " Well , we break real good at the quarter pole , but then this filly she see a bird or something and she break stride ... " The horses , sweating and frisky now , would kick out with their hind feet as the grooms ( " Hey now poppa , what'sa matter with you " ) lavished steaming buckets of hot water on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisking them dry with long aluminum scrapers . Often , after the horses ' baths , my father would let me take the shank of a quieter colt or filly and I 'd join the seemingly endless oval parade around the cooling-out ring . But the best part of the morning was when it name time to ride the pony . Fur as long as I could remember , my father 's pony was named Bill . I do n't know how many Pony Bills there were in all in the years I spent weekends and summers at the track , but I do know that I fell off just about every one of them . Even if I was hurt , as happened a couple of times , my father would always make me get right back on and ride some more . I never suspected that such rides would mark the end of my memory 's view of childhood . I did n't know that my parents would soon be divorced , or that I would be sent , in the fifth grade , to a military school in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of the attendant acrimony . Nor could I know that I would come to look upon such mornings at the racetrack as my strongest ties to earth and place , my strongest link to the kind of heritage I would read about in the library of that school . 65 Z-k DREAM MUCH LIKE MINE had actually come true for my father . Twice , in fact . As a boy of nine , he won his first horse race , riding a circus pony named Sparkle , not too much bigger than he was . at the old Jamaica track on Long Island . I do n't know how many other horses there were in the race , but I have been told they were under considerable restraint . In the picture taken in the winner 's circle , my father 's nine-year-old face is very serious , but the men standing around in black suits and hats behind him are all smiles . When he was seventeen , he won his second race , this time in real competition . " Congratulations , " says the telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first race today . " It was signed by my grandfather , " Carey . " Next to it , a yellowed clipping is more detailed : " Willie Winfrey rode his first winner here this afternoon . Son of G. Carey Winfrey , well-known owner and trainer , Willie has been trying to crash the winner 's circle since early in the last Florida campaign .... Eight answered the call , but little Willie showed them the way home . He brought the B. B. Stable 's two-year-old from behind in a rattling stretch drive to take command in the closing strides . The stable gang gave the little boy a great big hand . " The applause notwithstanding , my father has always said that the greatest mistake he made in life was quitting school in the ninth grade to become a jockey . My father 's riding career lasted less than a year . Having put on too much weight to continue as a jokey , he became , at eighteen , the country 's youngest licensed horse trainer , taking a string of my grandfather 's stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1941 , the year Whirlaway won the Triple Crown ) , my father had a small reputation and was developing better and better horses for a series of owners . When , in the late 1940s , Alfred G. Vanderbilt asked him to take charge of his once-commanding stable , my father willingly accepted and the next year found himself with three stakes winners ( Bed 0 ' Roses , Next Move , and Loser Weeper ) ; he had become one of the most talked . about young trainers in the country . But his great . est success was yet to come . As I cried myself to homesick sleep in a dormitory near Baltimore in 1951 , at Vanderbilt 's Sagamore farm a few miles away a spirited gray yearling was growing stronger and more powerful . My father said he could have trained himself . Television 's first equine celebrity , Native Dancer would win twenty-one of his twenty-two races , make the cover of Time magazine , inspire fan mail from matrons who did n't know a furlong from a furlough , and turn an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling people he was " Bill Winfrey 's boy . " HAVE N'T SEEN 6:00 A.M. for years . And on this , I my first morning returned to Saratoga . I see it only long enough to set the alarm again for seven . When I get to the track at eight , Lazero Barrera , horn in Cuba , and now one of the leading trainers in the United States as well as perhaps my fatherlis closest friend , shakes his head at me , his expression a mixture of mock anger and incomprehension . " Why you no come on the racetrack ? " he asks . Then , continuing before I have a chance to answer : " When a father does not prepare hees son to follow in hees heesness , it ees a very bad thing . " Perhaps there is more than sentiment in his remarks . The traditionalists ' school of horse trainer is a dwindling minority . Once it was the only school , its curriculum a composite of gentlemanly agree ments , camaraderie , and sportsmanship . Forbidden was greed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horses . The traditionalists were bound together by their devotion to the horse , to their rules , and to the blue-blood owners who saw racing through the troubled Depression and war years . Its membership included such men as Max Hirsch , Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons , Bert Mulholland , and Ben Jones I as well as my father and grandfather ) . In recent years , through death and retirement , their numbers have decreased , their WASP ranks invaded by a new breed of trainer : young , bright , aggressive , anxious to make money . The game has changed , its feudal benevolence given way to cost accounting and pension demands . The private stable , its bills and generous bonuses smilingly paid by kindly patriarchs fit was deductible , after all ) , has given way to the public stable , in which the trainer charges , say , $25 a day per horse , out of which he pays the expenses . Many of the best grooms and exercise boys are gone now too , retired , or forced by the new economics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tax loopholes and the invasion of new money , new priorities , and new faces have turned the racetrack into a fairground of hostile factions . To the eye , at least , all is as it was . Cars still creep silently past sidestepping horses , their riders still flamboyantly cocky . On the track , a rider stands upright in the stirrups , singing gaily in the breeze . The only visible difference is that the wood-burning water cauldrons that once filled the nostrils with the scent of burning pine have given way to a gas variety , the pipes leading to them looking like some strange gray snakes in the grass . And there are girls on the racetrack now , their presence less a victory for enlightened attitudes than a testimony to the employment crisis . They do much to improve the atmosphere . Gentleman horse trainer E. Barry Ryan interrupts my reverie . " We live in a great dream here , " he says . " People are whistling , the sun is shining , the horses are galloping . People are friendly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost forget the rest of it ? the cold , commercial side of it . " The rest of it exists , and in short order my notebook is filled with grievances : the working men rightfully complain of low wages and primitive living conditions ; the trainersbemoan the management 's courtship of the bettor ; the officials decry the greed of the horsemen . " All the officials care about are those blinkin ' lights , " says a trainer . " When they meet they do n't say , Good afternoon ' ; they say , ' What 's the attendance ? ' " " The trainers complain that they ca n't afford to pay better wages , " says an officer of the New York Racing Association , " but I do n't know of any group of professional men who drive newer cars . " I hear of racetrack judges who " do n't know what a bridle is " and a commissioner who " bets with both hands . " I hear of " Jew owners and wop trainers " and " Puerto Ricans with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new . " It 's not a sport anymore ? it 's a business , " I hear again and again and wonder if it ever was . Before long I stop listening . My racetrack had no such sordid sides . The grass was sweet , the air clean . My daddy won races and the purses were getting bigger all the time , I WAS ELEVEN DAYS OLD MY FIRST TRIP to Sara . toga , and I spent almost every August there until I was seventeen ... a year of Augusts . The people who live the other months there say that Saratoga in August is not Saratoga at all . The other months , they say , it is a quiet college town . But the Saratoga know is a serene carnival where , sitting on the corner of Fifth and Lake Avenues , Mike Kiley , Joe Toussant. and I could record all forty-eight states from passing license plates within a week of morning monitoring . It is cool in the mornings and hot in the afternoons , and the people who live near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go away in August so they can rent their houses for some outrageous figure . ) Each morning the Morning Telegraph , a racing paper costing seventy-five cents , outsells the New York Times , and each afternoon a four-page " racing extra " of The Saratogian is printed on pink paper , costs twenty-five cents , and always sells out . Henry James once called it the " northernmost Southern city " and Jimmy Cannon , the sportswriter , dubbed it " the Coney Island of the underworld , " referring to the old days before Kefauver when gambling and prostitution were its main sources of income . But those Saratogas are as alien to me as the one which is covered by snow . It looks the same . Most of its concessions to modernity line a single strip of highway leading out of town . Downtown the changes are subtle . " We Shorten Mini Skirts , " reads an unintentionally funny sign in a laundry , while , more seriously , a block and a political spectrum away , another sign announces : " Notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundry launches into a tirade against " them " and how " they 'll steal any . thing , " while a dentist bemoans Saratoga 's unique " busing " problem : ghetto children from New York City and Albany are brought in for a day of racing . Like other Saratoga citizens , the dentist is upset by the half-dozen " hippie shops " on Caroline Street . He sentimentally recalls the " fun " of Lucky Luciano 's Saratoga era , but confides in a whisper of disgust that we even have a marijuana problem . " Up from town , on spruce- and elm-shaded streets , the gabled homes remain , monuments to laissez-faire , caveat emptor , and a simpler tax structure . Their temporary residents , the August visitors , have breakfast in the Reading Room served by reverential Negroes with close-cropped white hair , followed by a round of golf and a hot sulphur bath . No need to get to the races much before 2:00 . T IIOROUGHBRED RACING FIRST CAME to Saratoga in 1863 on the site of what is now a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , racing was moved across Union Avenue to its present location . There is no more pleasant racing in America than the twentyfour-day meeting held there each year before a wooden grandstand little changed from the day the Travers , the oldest stakes race in the United States , was first run in 1864 . In the infield , stately elms form a lush parenthesis around a silver pond . Behind the grandstand , in the paddock , the horses walk in easy circles beneath the trees , scrutinized by their prospective backers , Now the trainers arrive to saddle them , just as the trainers arrived to saddle Upset the day he beat Man 0 ' War some fifty years ago . The horses ' owners , Jones as well as Vanderbilt , bend to speak softly to the little men in blight silks , and then the cry is heard , " Ri-ders Up . " Mounted now , the thoroughbred parade is led to the post by outriders in pink coats , the colorful prelude to the minute-or-more scramble that punctuates the afternoon nine times a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , but to the backstretch , where stable hands and their wives and children spent sunny , lazy afternoons picnicking under the elms and watching the races . My cousin Judy would come along . Sometimes , if the race started on the backstretch , Mr. Cassidy , the starter , would take us with him up onto the little green stand beside the gate where he pressed the buzzer . And of course we got to know all the assistant starters , big strong men in khaki shirts and pants who told wonderful stories about the war and the women they had loved , and between races played poker inside the totalizator board . Many days the best was saved for last . That was when my father would come to the backstretch early , before the last race . He often did so , to tell the truth , because he did n't much like to go to the races . T know that sounds funny , but it 's true . A lot of trainers do n't much like to go to the races , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation with the owners . They like horses , they like to see their horses run , they love to see their horses win , but if they 're not running anything , it can be pretty dull just sitting there day after day . So my father would come over to the backstretch and cheek to see that his horses were all okay . Then Judy and I would pile into the back seat of the car and roll the window down , and my father would drive right over to the starting gate , lining up with it and facing the same direction as the horses . When the horses broke , so would we , and with Judy and me leaning out the window in delight as the jockeys yelled at each other and maneuvered for position , my father would drive along , matching the horses ' pace exactly . Once you have seen a race this way , watching it from a distance seems very pallid indeed . Perhaps it is because of such recollections that the grandstand now begins to bore me so quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bettor . Most horsemen are not big bettors , and I 'm sure it is because they , more than anyone , understand " racing luck " and thereby know the multitude of things that can upset their best laid plans . They well know how the best horse in the race can be left flatfooted at the start , or break stride bolting from a passing bird , or bow a tendon , or , for a dozen other reasons I some as undetectable as a headache ) , run poorly . Successful handicapping , which requires overcoming the seventeen cents taken out of every dollar before it is wagered , is a full-time enterprise that requires a trainer 's knowledge of horses , a mathematician 's understanding of the totalizator board , and a psychologist 's insight into why one horse is being picked by the majority of bettors over another . Real horsemen , if they are any good at conditioning their charges , simply have no time to handicap the horses of others . Which is why a tip on a horse from a trainer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount is small and the motive is " for luck . " My father does this , as my grandfather did too , but where the most I have ever seen my father bet was $20 , my grandfather once bet $500 on one of his own colts . The colt went off at 12 to 1 : that afternoon my grandfather came home with a suitcase , opened it , and covered the bed with green paper bills . It may have been the occasional wager that took my grandfather to the races every day , but I do n't think so . It was just racing he loved , and maybe the crazy cast of characters that were such a part of his life : Chicken Sadie who cooked the best fried chicken he ever tasted . and Goldie who looked like a tramp and sold cigarettes and candy on the hack-stretch and could change a hundred-dollar bill without blinking an eye . My grandfather could n't understand anyone not loving racing as much as he did and his great hope for me was that I would become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept offering to buy me a couple of yearlings just to get me started . Y GRANDFATHER . HOW NICE IT IS to remember that man 's sweet self . In my father 's house in California there are two thin horseshoes mounted on a silver plaque . The plaque is inscribed : " These " Most horsemen shoes were worn by Tokalon , winner of the 1906 Brooklyn Handicap . When she came from Texas to win this rare , she brought with her as groom , G. Carey Winfrey , who stayed in the East to become one of New York 's greatest trainers . " That was my grandfather . Actually , he was my stepgrandfather . But as far as I was ever concerned , he was my Grandpa and the kindest man in the world . They say that in his middle years my grandfather was a strong , robust man who loved to drive automobiles fast , leaning into the steering wheel to make the tires squeal around turns . He once beat a Negro groom ? knocked him out with his fist ? for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " colored " side of the racetrack kitchen at the old Empire City racetrack . It was n't so much what the groom did as what he said after and the way he said it : " You ai n't back in Texas now , Mr. Winfrey . " My grandfather was from Texas , was a man of his time , and probably took a dim view of uppity black grooms . Still , the man I knew as Grandpa never would have done it . Grandpa was not robust . His hands shook from Parkinson 's disease . He drove very slowly . Grandpa smelled like witch hazel . He was shy and quiet but he laughed a lot ? a big , wide laugh , with a grin that hung on for a long time after . " How do you and I stand ? " he would ask me . And I , properly trained , would never answer that I did n't know . I 'd say , " How do we stand , Grandpa ? " He would smile then . " On our feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He never got tired of that one , and now that I think back on it , I never did either . My grandfather could remember a race at Bowie in " nineteen and nine " as if it were run this morning , and he was full of stories about the old days . But he had trouble with the more immediate past . He always called me , " Bill ... uh ... Carey , " seeing my father at my age so clearly in me . Or he 'd ask me to turn up the " radio " when he meant the television . His poor memory frustrated him a great deal . What bothered him most , I think , was forgetting the names of the horses he trained . He kept a small notebook with the horses ' names written down in just the order they stood in their stalls in the shed . The idea was that he could walk along , turning one page for each horse , and he 'd have the name right there- The only problem with that system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Ernest " Lasses " Wells and I sit one evening as the sun goes down and talk about my grandfather . Lasses started out as a jockey in Darlington , South Carolina in 1915 , getting " five for ridin ' , five for winnin ' . " When he got too heavy to ride , he started rubbing horses . Lasses is sixty . seven now and a night watchman , " One thing about your Grandpop , " he is saying . " He knowed his horses . If he kept a horse any time , you could believe he was gon na do some good with him some time . " My grandfather was never as famous a trainer as my father would be . Other horsemen knew how good he was , however , and the smart bettor did too . My grandfather usually wintered his horses in New York instead of taking them to California or Flor ? ida . When New York racing began again in the spring , my grandfather 's horses were used to the weather , used to the racetrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 , he saddled ten winners from his first sixteen starters . The following year , the New York Turf Writers Association voted him " Trainer of the Year . " When my grandfather heard about the award , he could n't believe it . - They must mean Bill , " he said , meaning my father . Finally convinced that , no , they did indeed mean him , he developed elaborate fears about the presentation ceremonies , Sunny Tim Fitzsimmons , then eighty-two , took him aside . " Now , son , " he said to my grandfather , eleven years his junior , " do n't get excited . Just take it easy as if you are saddling an old plater for an overnight race . Then everything will be all right . " " But what will I say when he hands me the plaque ? " my grandfather asked . " Just say thanks , " said Mr. Fitz . Which is just what my grandfather did . would drop him at the clubhouse , heading myself for the more informal atmosphere of the backstretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction there : Connie , a jockey 's daughter . In the evenings , my grandfather went to bed early , while I read or , occasionally , went to a movie . On one such evening I called Connie , suggesting we go to a movie . In my grandfather 's car I drove toward Saratoga Lake , where she lived . The road around the lake is narrow and winding , and at one point , dips into a hollow before banking sharply . I was just reaching the turn when another car , speeding , came at me , in my lane . I swerved , but the road was too narrow . In the collision I was thrown against the windshield , not seriously hurt . The young beer-drinking couple in the other car were also only shaken up . When I called my grandfather , he was calm . He would call my father , he said . It took about three hours to complete the agony of police paper work and the arranging for tow trucks and body shops . My father , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only when we had at last been released did I realize how enraged he was . He felt I had betrayed my grandfather , had gambled with his health . My grandfather , old and with a heart condition , might well have needed me just at the moment I was off " seeing some girl . " Neither tire skids , the police report , nor my protests could convince him that the accident was not my fault . I was just , lucky , he said , that the shock of it had not killed my grandfather . He berated me the long drive home , his voice shaking with anger , and I ? exhausted , afraid , not knowing what to say ? said nothing , staring omit into the night . He mistook my expression for cynicism . " How dare you just sit there , " he shouted , " waiting for me to finish . Why , you punk ... " I do n't remember what he said after that . The next day my father told me lie was selling my car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college I wanted to go to . He said it was a rich-kids school . A snob school . - He forbade me to go . My father sold my car and I hitchhiked through another year in Maryland . He meant to come to my graduation but at the last minute he had to run a horse in California and could n't get away . The next year I went to a college that he approved of . In my last year in college , my grandfather had a stroke and lay in the hospital very near death . My father flew to New York from California . It was the first time we had seen each other in a long time . We went to the hospital together . My grandfather was in a coma . When my father saw my grandfather 's vacant stare and his hollow cheeks , he broke down in tears . I had never seen my father cry . I do n't think anybody had . I went toward my father . / think to put my arms around him . But my father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put my hand on his shoulder . Then I took it away . I wanted to cry too . But I didn't.
