THE LIVING END by Stanley Elkin ; Dutton ; 148 pages ; $7.95 <P> In first-rate comic art , the funnier the surfaces the sadder the depths . Nowhere is that clearer than in the novels and short stories of Stanley Elkin , whose improvisations on the American way and the English language make him our foremost literary jazz band . His most exuberant characters-a department store owner , a bail bondsman , an itinerant radio announcer-combine the energy and appetites of the Middle West with the legendary qualities of Sholom Aleichem 's villagers . Elkin makes much joyful noise unto the Lord , but there is also banter to deflect the wrath , and complaining because it might do some good . There are no booming Faustian bargains in his work ; just fast , uneasy verbal agreements between small businessmen and their omnipotent Wholesale Supplier . <P> In The Living End , an inspired fantasy superbly executed , God has all markets rigged : <P> Hell as well as Heaven . Absent is a brooding Satan or a slick Beelzebub to direct the traffic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the ultimate inner city " in perpetual and agonizing meltdown . " Its stinking sulfurous streets were unsafe , " he writes . " Pointless , profitless muggings were commonplace ; joyless rape that punished its victims and offered no relief to the perpetrator . Everything was contagious , cancer as common as a cold , plague the quotidian . There was stomachache , headache , toothache , earache . There was angina and indigestion and painful third-degree burning itch . Nerves like a hideous body hair grew long enough to trip over and lay raw and exposed as live wires or shoelaces that had come undone . " <P> And Elkin 's Heaven ? A celestial froth of every storybook clich . It is a theme park of pearly gates , angels with harps , ambrosia , manna , a Heavenly choir that sings , " Oh dem golden slippers " and a St. Peter who answers a would-be club member 's wonderment with a snobby " We like it . " Peter is not entirely accurate . There are lonely child musicians whom God has untimely plucked because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tensions in the best of families : <P> Mary has never quite recovered from the pain and confusion of childbirth , Joseph kvetches about cuckoldry , and Jesus sometimes feels like a designated hitter . <P> If all this seems like an eschatological Upstairs , Downstairs , with the damned as underprivileged and God as absentee slumlord , let the reader be assured that Elkin 's Heaven and Hell are mainly framework . Unlike his other novels , centrifuges of virtuosity , The Living End is tightly structured , with a beginning , a middle and a sudden , inevitable end . <P> His new characters have less bulk but more definition : Ellerbee is the nicest of guys , a Minneapolis liquor-store owner who voluntarily supports the families of two employees who have been shot during a holdup . <P> When Ellerbee himself is gunned down behind the counter , he goes to Hell , where he joins armies of sinners double-timing through fire and filth .
