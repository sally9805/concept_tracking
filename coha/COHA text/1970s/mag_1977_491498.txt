In their new book , The Search for JFK ( Berkley/Putnam ) , Joan and Clay Blair , Jr. , provide a sober appraisal of the late President , at a time when the relationship between the personal lifestyle of a public figure and his capacity to fulfill his role as leader is under close scrutiny . Their research strips away the Camelot myth surrounding Kennedy and reveals , among other things , that here was a man who suffered under a malady which until the Fifties was considered fatal , and who conspired to hide the fact even while running for the nation 's highest office . We pick up the story as follows : Urged on by the warnings of President Truman and Secretary of State George Marshall that Europe was in a shambles and in danger of being overrun by Communism , some 200 members of the 80th Congress fanned out over the continent in the fall of 1947 to see for themselves the truth of the situation . Congressman John F. Kennedy had not been appointed to the official White House committee , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his House Labor Subcommittee , to study " labor problems in Europe , " with special emphasis on Communist infiltration of the unions . The trip was to include interviews with Russian officials ; however , Moscow refused visas on the spurious grounds that suitable accommodations were not available for such august visitors . Each friend traveled separately , to meet later in Europe . Kennedy flew to Shannon , Eire , on August 31 , 1947 , and combined pleasure with business by spending some time tracking clown members of the original Kennedy clan . During his stay at Lismore Castle he became ill : We believe that during his stay he became progressively sicker . At the Kennedy Library we found two items that indicated he urgently needed some kind of medicine . The first was a wire dated September 13 , from Jack at Lismore to Ted Reardon a member of Kennedy 's Congressional staff in Washington . Text : GET TWO PRESCRIPTIONS OF DOCTOR SULLIVAN OF BALTIMORE FOR HERE . HAVE THEM FILLED AND GET TO PATRICIA ( Patricia Kennedy , Jack 's younger sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN KENNEDY . The next was a wire from Jack to Reardon dated five days later , September 18 . Text : IF YOU DID NOT GET DOCTOR SULLIVANS TWO HAIR PRESCRIPTIONS TO PAT ON TIME GIVE THEM TO J. PATRICK LANN AN HOTEL PIERRE NEW YORK SAILING SATURDAY . JACK . Another medical mystery . We could find no other evidence that Jack was seeing a Dr. Sullivan in Baltimore or that he required a prescription for his " hair . " We guessed that since the wire would go through the House telegraph office  --  and thus become part of the public record  --  the message was some kind of code Reardon would understand . The prescriptionwas probably for something more serious than dandruff , we thought . But what ? On or about Saturday , September 20 , the day Lannan Kennedy 's friend sailed from New York , Jack and Pamela Churchill Kennedy 's sister Kathleen 's friend left Lis-more , drove to Dublin , and took a plane to London . We assumed Jack had plans to meet Pat Lannan in London , get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a prearranged place ( London ? Paris ? ) toward the end of the month . Pamela had separate plans . She told us she was passing through London on her way to the south of France for another holiday . According to Jack 's passport stamps , he arrived in London on September 21 . ( En route he bought forty cartons of tax-free cigarettes , according to some documents we found at the Kennedy Library . Why , we do not know . ) Pamela told us he checked into the Claridge Hotel . That very day , September 21 , 1947 , a ghastly chapter in the life of Jack Kennedy began . It is a story very few people know , and the few who do know avoid discussing it . The complete story has never before been fully documented and seen in print . It began in an undramatic way . Jack became ill . Pamela Churchill was probably the first to know . She told us : " On the day we arrived in London , Jack called me up from Claridge 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling well . So I called my doctor , who was Lord Beaverbrook 's doctor , Sir Daniel Davis . He 's dead now . I asked him to go around and see Jack at Claridge 's . He did  --  and put him straight in a hospital , the London Clinic . I was rushing off to the south of France . I had a wonderful housekeeper at my flat in London , old Mrs. Martin . So I said to Mrs. Martin , ' Lady Hartington 's brother is sick and in the London Clinic . The food is filthy there . Will you go around and take him his food ? ' So every day , as long as Jack was there , she took Jack his lunch and dinner . Jack always remembered Mrs. Martin . Years later , when he was president , he asked me about her one day and when I said she was still very much alive , he sent her a picture of himself  --  with a dedication . " Jack also telephoned his friend the British tennis star , Kay Stammers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was going to have lunch with him at Claridge 's . He called me and said he was ill . I asked what was the matter . He said he did n't know  --  but when he got out of bed he could n't stand up . They carted him off to the London Clinic . I saw him at the clinic . I brought him a little bit of filet steak because he did n't like the clinic food . He was darned ill , terribly thin and not a good color . " Pamela Churchill : " A couple of weeks later I got back from the south of France . I saw Dr. Davis and he said to me , ' That young American friend of yours , he has n't got a year to live . ' It was the first time they discovered that Jack had Addison 's disease . Well , the awful thing is , I did n't take it too seriously . It did n't distress me as much as it would have if an American doctor had said it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such absolute , opposite medical theories . And we were all so young and selfishly involved in our own lives . I do n't think I thought about it too much . I did n't dwell on it . " As we shall see , when rumors circulated years later  --  in 1959 ? that Jack had Addison 's disease , his aides , doctors , and Jack himself , denied it . Jack described his condition as a " partial adrenal insufficiency . " In 1960 , during the heat of the political convention in Los Angeles , aides of Lyndon B. Johnson , who was competing for the nomination , told the press Jack had Addison 's disease and had been kept alive all these years by drugs . Again Kennedy 's aides , including his doctors of that period and Bobby , Sargent Shriver , and Pierre Salinger , denied it was true . After the election , on November 11 , Jack was asked by a reporter if it were true . Again , a flat denial . In light of these denials , especially the statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm or refute the recollections of Pamela Churchill that it was here , in London , September , 1947 , that doctors first diagnosed that Jack had Addison 's disease . We spent weeks on this question alone , searching out old newspaper clips , exploring medical journals and textbooks on the disease , talking to Jack 's aides and friends , and finally to his doctor of the 1947 period , Elmer C. Bartels . Addison 's disease was discovered by a famous British physician , Thomas Addison , in about 1855 . It is a failure of the body 's adrenal glands . The adrenal glands , located above the kidneys , are vital to life . They produce hormones which regulate certain body metabolisms , fight infection and , in times of stress , provide extra strength . If the adrenals fail , a person can die of a simple infection . Addison reported the disease to be caused primarily by tuberculosis , which attacks the adrenal glands and finally destroys them . Years later medical research revealed that the adrenal glands could also fail through atrophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuberculosis . In 1949 Thorn reported that about half of all Addisonians he had treated were tubercular in origin , the other half atrophy . Addison 's disease is difficult to diagnose , especially in its early stages . The early symptoms are fatigue , general weakness , poor appetite , and weight loss . The late stages are nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and circulatory collapse . The physician finds low blood pressure , soft pulse , poor heart tones , and generalized brownish pigmentation  --  a tanning of the skin , especially over exposed areas and points of pressure of the mucous membranes . Tiny " ink spots " are also noted over the body . Failure of the adrenal glands results in disturbance of salt and water metabolism , the utilization of body carbohydrates . Of importance is the body 's loss of resistance to infection and power of immunity . In some instances physicians have confused the yellowish or brownish pigmentation of the skin with jaundice or malaria . But a well-oriented physician , combining all the symptoms , is usually not misled in his diagnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to confirm the diagnosis of Addison 's disease . Addison 's disease does not usually come on suddenly . As a rule , it is insidious in its onset with gradual development ofsymptoms  --  though , of course , there were cases that developed very suddenly , precipitated by a strain or infection . In its acute stage  --  known as an Addisonian crisis  --  the disease is unmistakable . Addisonian crisis is usually brought on by some kind of provocation which demands hormones which are not forthcoming from the diseased adrenals , such as infection or excessive physical stress , shock developing ( as for example , in an accident or a surgical operation ) , or by a loss of salt and water through strenuous exercise on a hot and humid day . The crisis is a serious condition for the patient . He usually feels dizzy , light-headed , unduly weak and fatigued ; his pulse becomes feeble . There usually is nausea , vomiting , and then suddenly the body temperature becomes subnormal . In many cases , the patient becomes disoriented and lapses into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately Addison 's disease is relatively rare . In the early days following its discovery there was not much anyone could do to treat it . It was considered a fatal affliction . As Thorn points out , prior to 1930 the mortality rate five years following the onset of the disease was 90 percent . In the early 1930 's , endocrinologists experimented with a high-salt , low-potassium diet , which was helpful . The mortality rate five years after onset fell to 78 percent . Then , in the later 1930 's , endocrinologists probing the frontiers of hormone research began to extract , in a very complicated and expensive process , adrenal hormones ( adrenal cortical extracts ) from cows and hop . Daily injections of these rare and expensive hormone extracts , which varied greatly in strength and stability , benefited the Addisonian patient and the mortality rate fell substantially . In 1939 endocrinologists developed a synthetic substance , desoxycorticosterone acetate ( DOCA ) , which , as Thorn states , " was found to possess cortical hormone-like activity . " It was more active than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potassium intake the new drug greatly reduced the mortality rate of Addisonians . Physicians developed a means of implanting solid " pellets " of DOCA in the muscles of thighs or the back  --  thus eliminating the needle injections and making the patient much more independent . With the administration of DOCA , Thorn observed , " noticeable lightening " of the complexion occurred during the course of prolonged treatment . This is where it stood in the fall of 1947 . If the patient survived the Addisonian crisis , he then went on injections of DOCA combined with regulated salt , water , and potassium intake . Afterward patients who could received the DOCA implants , which eliminated the injections . The pellets ( usually one to four ) released the needed daily hormones as the body required . They had to be replaced , by a simple procedure , after about two or three months . Even with these new drugs , the life of an Addisonian still required careful discipline . The patient had to avoid heavy stress or physical exertion and wide changes in climate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a tooth extraction , were considered risky . A minor infection such as a cold could precipitate a crisis and require hospitalization and careful medical management . Patients simply died of shock or infection . In sum , merely to survive required a restrained life and good medical care . Returning now to Jack in the London clinic . Did he have Addison 's disease , as Pamela Churchill told us , or a milder form of the disease  --  or something else ? We turned to the scrapbooks of newspaper clippings . We saw that this particular illness had been well covered by the Boston papers . They reported that Jack was in the London Clinic , and that he sailed from Southampton on the Queen Mary October 11 . One paper wrote that Jack had been " a patient in the ship 's hospital . " The Queen Mary docked October 16 in New York . Jack 's passport was stamped with an entry mark on that day , we noted . The Boston papers continued to follow Jack 's journey . An ambulance met the Queen Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then taken to a chartered plane at LaGuardia Airport . The plane flew him to Boston where , the papers reported , he would be cared for by the doctors at the Lahey Clinic . Reporters were on hand when Jack arrived at the New England Baptist Hospital on a wheeled stretcher . A reporter who saw Jack described him as being " thin and wan . " One of Jack 's friends of this period , Frank Waldrop of the Washington Times-Herald , had a distinct , recollection of this high drama . In our interview , he told us , " He went to England on a trip . He got sick . The word was given out that he 'd had some kind of attack from swallowing sea water and oil on the PT-109 thing . I guess the truth was it was the onset of the Addison 's . I know he was given extreme unction and brought off the ship on a stretcher and it was touch and go . " We knew from some notices in the Kennedy Library files and the appointment books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new doctor at the Lahey Clinic . He was Elmer C. Bartels . Bartels was a thyroid specialist  --  a gland specialist with a great deal of expertise in endocrinology . We had speculated that if Jack had come down with Addison 's disease , Bartels would have been the logical man at the Lahey Clinic to treat him . As our interview with Dr. Bartels progressed , we drew closer to the subject warily , knowing how controversial the issue had been in 1959 and 1960 . To our knowledge Dr. Bartels had never been interviewed by a journalist . We fully expected the usual " I ca n't discuss a patient 's diseases , " but to our surprise we found that Dr. Bartels was willing to talk to us about it . He said that he thought that the truth should now be made known . He told us flatly and unequivocally that Jack had been diagnosed as having Addison 's disease in England and had been sent to Boston to continue treatment . It was not a " partial adrenal insufficiency , " but truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in the crisis stage when he returned to Boston , as he 'd been on active treatment . I do n't know what his condition was in England  --  just that they made the diagnosis over there . He had an episode of weakness , nausea , and vomiting , and low blood pressure , which led to the diagnosis . The reason you collapse in Addisonian crisis results from low blood pressure . " When you develop Addison 's , there is loss of appetite , loss of weight , great fatigue . Pigmentation of the exposed areas of the body and hands . And the hair stays brown . That 's the only nice thing about Addison 's , your hair remains brown and does n't turn gray . You always stay young-looking . " Without a functioning adrenal gland one is very sensitive to infection . It used to be fatal in the old days before we had adrenal replacement  --  hormones . The patient invariably died of infection  --  even getting a tooth extracted was serious . " I 'm sure that 's the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain tests one does to confirm the diagnosis , although the clinical history is quite definite . So on clinical grounds and laboratory studies it was confirmed that that was the problem . Addison 's disease . " We wondered how long Jack had had Addison 's disease . Dr. Bartels could not recall Jack 's prior medical history . He could not precisely date the onset . Every case of Addison 's disease is different . If the cause of Jack 's adrenal disorder was atrophy , then the dissolution had occurred gradually over a number of years . We thought that might explain various illnesses beginning with that severe illness in his fifth-form year at Choate , and the " jaundice " in September or October , 1935 . Had he had a mild form of Addison 's disease ? Had doctors confused his " jaundice " for the pigmentation associated with mild Addison 's ? As we saw from the medical texts , a lingering adrenal disorder would explain his symptoms over the next few years : general fatigue. , gastrointestinal problems and absolute inability to gain weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triggered by the trauma of the back operation in June , 1944 . During the 1946 campaign several workers had recalled Jack 's peculiar " yellowish color . " In a passing reference to Jack in its issue of April 14 , 1947 , Time described Jack as " still Atabrine-yellow from PT boat service in the Pacific . " Lacking Jack 's medical records , all this must remain pure speculation , which Dr. Bartels , a precise man , refused to engage in . He said , " Addison 's disease is n't a chronic disease in the sense that you have it for five years and then discover you have it . When you develop Addison 's disease it 's usually known within a year . " But there remained the possibility that it came on very gradually with the atrophy of the adrenals . Nor could Dr. Bartels recall the exact treatment he prescribed for Jack in October , 1947 . We presumed it was the standard one , daily injections of DOCA for a month or so followed by DOCA pellets . Later Jack had periodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosage for the Addisonian . At that stage of hormone research there was on the horizon a new development that would vastly help the Addisonian patient . This was the new " miracle drug , " the hormone cortisone . In April , 1949 , an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic , Philip S. Hench , announced that cortisone had been found successful in the treatment of patients with arthritis . This news set off a great stampede for the drug . But it was scarce and terribly expensive . In response to the huge demand , pharmaceutical laboratories began producing it by various means . By 1951 it was available to all at a reasonable price  --  and in oral form . In the later 1950 's the drug was further improved . Since cortisone is fundamentally a cortical extract , endocrinologists knew it would also be beneficial to Addisonian patients . In fact , for them , it was also a " miracle drug . " It would not cure the disease , but when used in conjunction with the implanted DOCA pellets , it would enable Addisonians , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would still have to avoid trauma , such as an operation , but cortisone dropped the mortality rate enormously . At some point Jack began taking cortisone , probably first by injection , then orally . Our guess is about 1949 , when cortisone first began to be available . Bartels recalled that the Kennedys maintained safe-deposit boxes around the country where they kept a supply of cortisone and DOCA  --  so that Jack would never run out . Seven years after the onset of the disease , in 1954 , Jack was receiving the standard treatment for Addison 's disease . He had implanted DOCA pellets of 150 mg , which were replaced every three or four months . Thorn wrote that the cortisone treatment for Addisonians ( usually with DOCA ) had an almost magical effect . " The outstanding linical findings , " he wrote , " were those of markedly increased sense of wellbeing approaching a state of euphoria accompanied by a real increase in energy , concentrating pow-er , muscular strength and endurance . There was a marked improvement in appetite and an increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most patients discovered , cortisone markedly increased sexual de-sire . Beginning in 1947 at the London Clinic , and continuing to the time of our search , Jack and the Kennedy family , some of Jack 's doctors , and some of his political aides engaged in a systematic cover-up of his Addison 's disease . We believe an examination of the cover-up worthwhile for several reasons . It tells something about political technique in mid-century America . It tells us something further about Jack and his father . Finally , it is a fascinating and moving story . The cover-up began in October , 1947 , when the Boston papers found out Jack was sick in the London Clinic . Jack or somebody decided to tell the press he had had an attack of " malaria . " The cover-up was launched with a statement from Jack given at the London Clinic to the Associated Press . The statement was published in the Boston Herald on October 7 , 1947 : " Congressman John F. Kennedy announced today that he was ' much better ' after a month 's bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a patient at the London Clinic . " Kennedy , who has suffered malaria since 1943 , said the attack began while he was visiting Ireland , forcing him to abandon plans for a tour of France and Italy . " In the ensuing days , we noted , the other Boston papers , the New York Times , and Time magazine reported the illness as malaria contracted in the South Pacific during his PT service . The Boston and Washington offices were probably instructed to give this out as the standard line . In the Kennedy files we found several letters from Frank Morrissey in the Boston office in October , 1947 , canceling speaking engagements for Jack . Typical was one dated October 21 : " As you perhaps know , Congressman Kennedy suffered an attack of malaria while studying labor conditions in Europe . At present he is confined to the hospital and has been advised to give up all speaking engagements for the next few weeks . " The " malaria " cover story would come back to haunt them , but at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotted out as necessary to explain other hospital confinements  --  for example , in Okinawa in November , 1951 , and in Washington in July , 1953 . In the late 1940 's and into the mid-1950 's there was not even a hint in the press anywhere that Jack had any disabilities other than his PT-connected hack problems and malaria . By 1954 , seven years after Bartels began treating Jack for Addison 's disease , the back pain was so intense Jack could barely walk , and then only with crutches . He was told by some medical authorities that a " double-fusion " operation on his back might stabilize it and enable him to function without pain . But because Jack had Addison 's disease , the doctors at Lahey Clinic firmly opposed the idea of the operation . Jack sought out new doctors in New York . Chief among these were Dr. Ephraim Shorr , head of the Endocrinology Service at the New York Hospital , Cornell University Medical College Complex , and an orthopedic surgeon ; and Philip D. Wilson , at the New York Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned whether it was absolutely certain that Jack had Addison 's disease . I went down to the hospital in New York to see him before he was operated on . I stressed the increased risk of doing surgery on a patient with Addison 's disease . " Jack entered a New York hospital October 21 , 1954 . He remained until February 26 , 1955 . When the operation was finished , the orthopedic operating team , headed by Philip D. Wilson , was proud of its work . Jack survived , though just barely . The team was anxious to get the word out to the medical profession that one could operate on a patient with Addison 's disease . So they wrote a description of the operation that was published in the November , 1955 , issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association Archive of Surgery . In keeping with medical tradition , Jack 's name was not used . This article , we believe , is conclusive proof , if more is needed , that Jack had classic Addison 's disease . It is signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the team : James A. Nicholas , Charles L. Burstein , and Charles J. Umberger . In a footnote they say , " Dr. Ephraim Shoff . provided advice in the management of this case . " The team did not mince words about Jack 's condition . They describe him as a man with classic Addison 's disease , taking the standard treatment . Excerpts : " A man 37 years of age had Addison 's disease for seven years . He had been managed fairly successfully for several years on a program of desoxycorticosterone acetate pellets of 150 mg. implanted every three months and cortisone in doses of 25 mg. daily orally . Owing to a back injury , he had a great deal of pain which interfered with his daily routine . Orthopedic consultation suggested that he might be helped by a lumbosacral fusion together with a sacroiliac fusion . Because of the severe degree of trauma involved in these operations and because of the patient 's adrenocortical insufficiency due to Addison 's disease , it was deemed dangerous to proceed with these operations . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention , it was decided , reluctantly , to perform the operations by doing the two different procedures at different times if necessary and by having a team versed in endocrinology and surgical physiology help in the management of this patient before , during and after the operation . " The article goes on , in highly technical terms , to describe the operation which " was accomplished on October 21 , 1954 . " It states that both a " lumbosacral fusion " and a " sacroiliac fusion " were performed " since the patient 's condition remained good . " The team was pleased . " The postoperative course was satisfactory in that no Addisonian crisis developed at any time during the next two months . " Four months after the operation , in February , 1955 , Jack underwent surgery again " for the removal of a Wilson plate which had been used in the spinal fusion as a form of fixation . " Again , no Addisonian crisis . The authors concluded , " Though the patient had marked adreno-cortical insufficiency , though the magnitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this patient had a smooth postoperative course insofar as no Addisonian crisis ever developed . " The postoperative complication referred to in the article was that which Bartels feared as much as an Addisonian crisis : a severe infection that nearly killed Jack . In a brief mention of the operation Rose stated , " He nearly died : he received the Last Rites of the Church . " This occurred , she wrote , after thefirst operation . In his oral history at the Kennedy Library , Arthur Krock says that in that dark moment the ambassador came to his office at the New York Times . " He told me he thought Jack was dying and he wept sitting in the chair opposite me in the office . " By the time this operation took place , Jack was a popular United States Senator and the state of his health received more notice than during his younger days . The New York Times , for example , carried three brief stories on the operation : October 11 and October 21 , 1954 , and February 26 , 1955 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for surgery , and that he had had spinal surgery and had been discharged . Each of these stories related his back problems to his PT service . But none mentioned the severe complications  --  that Jack had nearly died  --  or that he had Addison 's disease . We do not know how Jack or the Kennedy family reacted to the publication of the " medical history " in the AMA Journal in November , 1955 , by his surgical team . No doubt they were disturbed . Within the field of endocrinology , Jack 's case must have been well known . No doubt some doctors easily recognized him from the description . Now , here in the public record , was a full disclosure of Jack 's Addison 's disease and the precise treatment he was receiving for it . Any doctor or nurse or technician could have drawn it to the attention of a reporter . But Jack was lucky . In spite of the furor raised about the state of his health in 1959 and 1960 , no reporter " discovered " the AMA article or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House . In the late 1950 's , as Jack embarked on that quest , " presidential health " arose as an important issue . It sprang from the fact that in September , 1955 , Eisenhower had had a massive heart attack while in office and Nixon had very nearly ascended to the presidency . Thus , in 1959 and 1960 , reporters began digging into the health of the various candidates , including Jack . The digging must have caused Jack anguish . In fact , sustained by drugs , he was entirely qualified for the White House . He had plenty of vigor and stamina ; the drugs did not impair him mentally . There was no reason , then , to think he could not live out two terms in the White House in relatively good health . But , as Sorensen points out in his book , Addison 's disease had " a frightening sound to laymen . " In the minds of many voters it would be considered a fatal disease and would disqualify Jack for the presidency . To concede he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good either . Thus Jack was caught in a real dilemma . He decided to tough it out  --  bluff his way through the reportorial digging . This required a number of delicate obfuscations . For one thing , the damning article in the November , 1955 , AMA Journal was on the public record . At any time a reporter might find it . Thus it became necessary to concede some kind of adrenal disorder . For another , they had used the " malaria " cover-up . It , too , was on the record . A reporter might dig back through the clips and discover that all those years Jack or his aides had been lying to the press about his health , a matter as grave as the illness itself . Thus it was necessary to cover up the malaria cover-up . From various memoirs and public statements Jack 's aides issued , we deduced the medical public relations strategy was roughly as follows . They would continue to emphasize heavily the " malaria " and relate it to PT-109 , but declare the malaria completely cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters . They would concede a minor adrenal disorder , emphasizing that many physicians could confuse such minor disorders with Addison 's disease . They would prove that it was merely a minor adrenal disorder by pointing out that Jack did not then have abnormal pigmentation characteristic of classical Addison 's . They would assert that the minor adrenal disorder arose from the shock and stress of the PT-109 episode or the malaria  --  giving his adrenal deficiency a heroic air , as they had done with Jack 's back . Dr. Travell was named the chief spokesman to carry out the strategy . On July 21 , 1959 , she composed a medical statement for Jack . Parts of the statement appear in her book , parts in an article by Ernest Barcella on Jack 's health in the February , 1961 , issue of Today 's Health ( an official popular magazine of the AMA ) . Dr. Travell makes the important , though highly dubious , point that doctors often confused true Addison 's with a minor adrenal disorder , and goes on to say that : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blown up , he was subjected to extraordinarily severe stress in a terrific ordeal of swimming to rescue his men . This , together perhaps with subsequent malaria , resulted in a depletion of adrenal function from which he is now rehabilitated . " Concerning the question of Addison 's disease , which has been raised . This disease was described by Thomas Addison in 1855 and is characterized by a bluish discoloration of the mucous membranes of the mouth and permanent deep pigmentation or tanning of the skin . Pigmentation appears early and it is the most striking physical sign of the disease . Senator Kennedy has never had any abnormal pigmentation of the skin or mucous membranes ; it would be readily visible . " Senator Kennedy has tremendous physical stamina . He has above-average resistance to infections , such as influenza . . .. " There are three interesting obfuscations in the statement . Dr. Travell does not actually deny Jack had Addison 's disease . It is implied , but not stated . Secondly , the pigmentation argument is irrelevant . The hormone drugs had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirdly , if Jack had " above-average " resistance to infection it was because he was continually on drugs designed to fight infection . But she avoids mentioning that he was on drugs , merely saying he had been " rehabilitated " from a " depletion of adrenal function . " How she determined he had " above-average " resistance  --  what statistical basis was employed  --  remains a mystery . At this same time  --  summer , 1959 ? James MacGregor Bums was concluding his research and writing his book . He , too , asked Jack questions about his health  --  particularly the Addison 's disease . In response , Bums writes , Jack or his aide gave Burns a copy of the statement given Knebel and let him see the July 21 , 1959 , " medical statement " prepared by Travell . Based on these statements and " other sources , " Burns , without identifying Travel ! as the author of the July 21 statement , quotes the Kriebel statement ? " a partial adrenal insufficiency " linked to the PT-109 , then follows with : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some doctors as a mild case of Addison 's disease , it was not diagnosed as the classic type of Addison 's disease , which is due to tuberculosis . Other conditions , often not known , can cause inadequatefunctioning of the adrenal glands . As in Kennedy 's case , this can be fully controlled by medication taken by mouth and requires a routine endocrinologic checkup as part of a regular physical examination once or twice a year . As the Democrats were gathering in Los Angeles in early July , 1960 , the state of Jack 's adrenals arose again  --  this time forcefully and dramatically . On July 2 , Harry Truman , who did not believe Jack should have the nomination , went on national television and asked if Jack really had the " maturity and experience " required of the presidency . Two days later , from New York , Jack appeared on national television to respond to the Truman attack . In the course of defending himself he said the presidency demanded " the strength and health and vigor of . .. young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hotly contesting Jack for the nomination , interpreted this as a slur on Johnson , who had had a heart attack in 1955 . On the same day Jack spoke , July 4 , two Johnson aides , John B. Connally , director of Citizens for Johnson , and Mrs. India Edwards , a former vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee , called a press conference and opened fire on Jack 's health . As reported by William H. Lawrence in the New York Times of July 5 , Mrs. Edwards , a paid Democratic Party worker , said flatly that she had been told by " several doctors " that Kennedy had " Addison 's disease . " She added , " Doctors have told me he would not be alive if it were not for cortisone . " She was revealing this fact about Jack , she said , because she " objected to his muscle-flexing in boasting about his youth . " Mrs. Edwards and John Connally proposed a " health test " for all the Democratic contenders , Lawrence reported . Connally said he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Kennedy camp in Los Angeles was angry beyond measure , as we saw in various memoirs . Jack 's press aide , Pierre Salinger , for example , wrote in his book With Kennedy that " . . . the accusation went beyond the latitude of fair play . . .. " Salinger , Bobby , and Sargent Shriver tracked down Dr. Travel ! by telephone to get her permission to release yet another medical statement which she and Dr. Eugene J. Cohen had prepared on June 11 , 1960 . Most of the key elements of this statement are published in the July 18 issue of U.S. News and World Report . They again make the point that Jack 's resistance to infection was " above average " and write that , " With respect to the old problem of adrenal insufficiency , as late as December , 1958 , when you had a general checkup with a specific test of adrenal function , the result shows that your adrenal glands do function . " In the press briefings , Bobby and Salinger gave reporters this new statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Kennedy does not now nor has he ever had an ailment described classically as Addison 's disease , which is a tuberculose destruction of the adrenal gland . Any statement to the contrary is malicious and false . . . in the postwar period he had some mild adrenal insufficiency . This is not in any way a dangerous condition and it is possible that even this might have been corrected over the years since an ACTH stimu-li lation test for adrenal function was considered normal in December 1958 . Doctors have stated that this condition that he has had might well have arisen out of his wartime experiences of shock and continued malaria . .. Pierre Salinger reports in his memoir that the press " shared his view " that the attack on Jack had been unfair . This was apparently so . In his New York Times story of July 5 containing the Connally-Edwards charge and the Kennedy rebuttal , Lawrence included both the Bobby statement and the Travell-Cohen statements , giving the Bobby statement precedence . He did not point out that whereas Bobby claimed Jack 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , " Travell-Cohen had said merely that the test showed Jack 's adrenals " do function . " Lawrence also quotes the complete text of the Burns statement . A shirttail story from Washington quoted Ted Sorensen as saying Jack was " not on cortisone . I do n't know that he is on anything  --  any more than you or I are on . " It had been a tense moment in Jack 's political fortunes . But the strategy of obfuscation and the half-truths worked brilliantly . Reporters considered the **25;3898;TOOLONG statements as definitive . None dug deeper or seriously questioned the statements . Luckily for Jack the November 1955 AMA Journal article did not turn up at this point . Nor did any of Jack 's other doctors step forward . In our interview Bartels recalled that he was annoyed by Dr. Travell 's implied impression that Jack had better than average health ( resistance to infection ) and thought her statement " dishonest . " He told her that she should concede Jack had Addison 's disease , stating that with proper treatment there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he issued no public statement . After one day , plus a cursory follow-up in the news magazines , the story died . Jack himself had never publicly spoken directly on the subject of his adrenals . It had all been done through his political associates  --  and here we include Drs . Travell and Cohen . But after his election he did speak out , during a press conference on November 10 , 1960 , at Hyannis Port . This is the way the New York Times reported it the following day : " When someone asked about reports circulated in the campaign that he had once suffered from Addison 's disease . .. Senator Kennedy answered without hesitation . " ' I have never had Addison 's disease , ' he said . ' In regard to my health , it was fully explained in a press statement in the middle of July , and my health is excellent . I have been through a long campaign and my health is very good today . ' " There the matter rested  --  for three months . Then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York ) Sunday Press , a reporter , Paul Martin , Washington bureau chief of the Gannett newspapers , turned up the November , 1955 , AMA Journal article . He speculated it must have been a description of Jack . But this important revelation caused no stir at all . Buy that time , the New Frontier was in full gear and Dr. Travel was the official White House physician . She was spoon-feeding the press misleading stories about Jack 's health . None of the reporters in Washington followed up Martin 's disclosure . But in official medical circles the matter was not forgotten . Long after Jack 's death , one physician , John Nichols , reopened the matter in the July 10 , 1967 , issue of the AMA Journal . Having done a little detective work , Dr. Nichols published excerpts of the three New York Times stories printed during Jack 's 1954-1955 back operation , linking them to the November , 1955 , AMA article . He stated the article had to be about Jack , and that he " accepts the clinical diagnosisof Addison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " concealment of the diagnosis , " maintaining that Addison 's disease , " formerly fatal , is an honorable disease and is not a disease to be concealed . " He argued that if the true facts in Jack 's case were made known , it would be immensely encouraging to Addisonians . But this article made no impression in the press . The following year , 1968 , Travel ! published her book . Ow ' would have thought that after all the controversy in 1960 ? and now the challenge being raised by Dr. Nichols in official medical circles  --  she would have included a careful medical exposition of Jack 's case , conclusively documenting her contention that Jack did not have Addison 's disease , with the original London Clinic diagnosis , the Lahey Clinic follow-up diagnosis , and subsequent medical records . No such luck . She ducks altogether on this important point , stating that the " true facts " were contained in Burns ( who had obtained his original " facts " from her ) , Then , as her final authority that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Burns statement in full ! The other Kennedy books and memoirs by political aides are no less obscure and confusing on the matter . Rose , for example , discusses it not at all . Sorensen is most confusing . He seems to concede a cover-up , yet he does not actually say so , further obfuscating with this statement : " Instead of the term Addison 's disease he preferred to refer to the ' partial mild insufficiency ' or malfunctioning ' of the adrenal glands which had accompanied the malaria , water exposure , shock , stress he had undergone during his wartime ordeal . " Schlesinger wrote , " Then he was told that he had Addison 's disease ... and between 1946 and 1949 he went on a regimen of cortisone . . ? It developed later that he did not have Addison 's disease in the classic sense ... . " Most recently ( 1975 ) , Ben Bradlee , in Conversations With Kennedy , wrote of Jack 's White House years , " Kennedy 's Addison 's disease was always a mystery to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it often made his face fuller . Vain as always it bugged him if he appeared a little jowly at press conferences , which he often did , not because he overate , but because he was taking some form of cortisone . " There was one final mention of Jack 's adrenals in the medical journals . In 1972 the Kennedy family permitted a friendly physician , John K. Lattimer , to examine the autopsy photographs , X rays , and related materials barred from the public . The primary purpose of this new look was to quell doubts about the Warren Commission Report regarding the number of bullets fired , and so on . Lattimer published his findings ( supporting the Warren Commission ) in a thirty-page article in the May , 1972 , issue of Resident and Staff Physician Magazine . In this article Dr. Lattimer gives the first official description of Jack 's adrenals . He wrote : " The adrenal gland areas were well visualized on the X rays of the mid-portion of the body and no abnormal calcification could be seen in those areas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's firm belief that the President suffered from bilateral adrenal atrophy . " Like Dr. Nichols , Dr. Lattimer thought the full facts on Jack 's disease should be published and recommended : " That for the benefit of other sufferers from adrenal insufficiency , " some other doctors be authorized to describe the President 's adrenal glands , " to demonstrate that even the pressures of the Presidency could be overcome by a man with this condition . . . . " This was where the cover-up rested in 1973 when we interviewed Dr. Bartels . Having followed this rather complicated story to that point , the reader can now appreciate our surprise when Dr. Bartels revealed that the original diagnosis of Jack 's malady at the London Clinic had , in fact , been Addison 's disease , and that he had confirmed it himself . After our long discussion , only one point bothered him . He was not satisfied with Dr. Lattimer 's conclusion that Jack 's adrenals had been destroyed by atrophy . He said he would like very much to have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact been caused by atrophy  --  or by tuberculosis . After our interview with Dr. Bartels , we renewed our efforts to have Jack 's official medical records opened up . Edward Kennedy , through his press aide , Richard Drayne , continued to resist , and finally to ignore altogether our various queries . In light of this , the reader can well imagine our further surprise when , during our interview with Sargent Shriver , he said : " What happened was that Addison 's disease used to be fatal . But in that period , 1950 to 1960 , treatment developed for the disease . If you had put out astatement that Jack Kennedy had Addison 's disease , everybody would have said , ' He 's going to die . ' Therefore you had to explain what the situation was in such a way that was not dishonest but would not arouse a reaction that was dishonest in view of medical advances . So they said yes , he had a disability , but it was treatable . " Some final thoughts on this matter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his diagnosis of Addison 's disease and now that a member of the family , Sargent Shriver , has conceded that Jack positively had Addison 's disease , we would hope that Jack 's other doctors would step forward and tell the whole story . Along with that , we would hope that Jack 's full medical records  --  including the autopsy on his adrenals  --  could be made public . The only purpose served by continuing to keep these records secret is to avoid embarrassment to those still living who participated , wittingly or unwittingly , in the cover-up of Jack 's Addison 's disease . Beyond doubt , the full story of Jack 's fight against Addison 's disease will prove to be a much more heroic tale than his service on PT-109,2:i
