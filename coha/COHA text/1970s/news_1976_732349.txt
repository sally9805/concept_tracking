txt Sex and pot . Always good fodder for the media . Pot and sex . Better fodder for the politicans . And if it 's federally funded sex and pot in a southern Illinios town , it 's great fodder for just about everybody . Just about everybody , that is , outside of Carbondale . POLITICIANS HAVE said they are shocked by it . The news media have written story after story on it . Johnny Carson has wisecracked about ft . And a small but determined group in town say they are going to put a stop to it . But most of the 27,000 citizens of Carbondale , and the 20,000 students at Southern Illinios University , just shrug their shotdders .. " The Experiment , " to be conducted by SIU psychologist Dr. Harris Rubin , is to test the effects of marijuana on human sexual response . He has received , so far , $62,500 in federal funds from the National Institute of Ding Abuse . ABOUT 60 MALE volunteers  --  all 21 or over and admitted marijuana userswill inhale measured amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a series of erotic movies , during which their sexual responses will be measured by a transducer ? a rubber band-like apparatus that measures the diameter of the penis . " Tax-paid debauchery , " charges the St. Louis Globe-Democrat . " A waste of money , " declares Gov . Walker . " A frivolous use of funds , " charges U. S. Rep. Robert Michel R. , Peoria . " Much ado about nothing , " says Carbondale police chief George Kennedy . And most of the local officials agree . BUT . THEN , CARBONDALE is not your run-of-the-mill southern Illinois town . Although it 's in the Bible belt , it has X-rated movie theaters . Until the Deja Vu burned down last week , it had two massage parlors . It 's in a county that went for . And half the city 's hefty $15-million-a-year budget comes from government grants . But most importantly , it has the university . Friction has flared between the school and the community in the past  --  especially in the ' 60s . And sometimes , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when 3,000 students stream from the bars into the streets at 2 a.m. , the police close off Illinois Avenue , rejecting offers from townsfolk to bring down their shotguns or semi-trucks to disperse the crowd . But the city has come to accept the students ' presence  --  and the millions of dollars they bring with them each year . And the local citizenry and the students have settled into a working relationship ? anything one side might do does not surprise the other . AND SO . WITH THAT attitude , " the Experiment " has failed to jolt Carbondale . Dr. Rubin , 43 , an intense man with graying sideburns , says he does n't understand why he gets 25 calls a day from reporters . He conducted a similar experiment with alcohol and got no publicity at all . But then it was not federally funded . And alcohol is legal . " My purpose it to find out what marijuana does , " Rubin says . " I 'M NOT DOING THIS to advocate anything , " he says . " There are 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . The National Institute of Drug Abuse , which ' funded me , is at : : temtping to study an abused drug  --  mar : - ijuana . This is just one of a large number of experiments that NIDA is supporting . " I think it is important because many , young people say smoking enhances their sexual behavior . Polls taken show ? 50 to 60 per cent believe this . We 've got to be definitive about it . It may be that it does n't . " I ' would like my own kids to think ? many times before they ever use marijuana . . . because we do n't know that much about it . But I 'm also disturbed because the laws make so many criminals . My purpose is to find out about marijuana . . . not change laws . " THOUGH RUBIN HAS the money , the equipment , and the erotic movies , he can not proceed . Before his research assistants begin screening volunteers , he must get immunity from prosecution  --  for himself and the 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The immunity must come from the Drug Enforcement Administration , which is under the Justice Department . and that immunity is something that U.S. Atty . Henry Schwarz in East St. Louis is not willing to bet on . Schwarz wants to put an end to the whole thing . Schwarz is planning to fly to Washington , D. C. , soon to present his argument against the ' experiment . He , predicts Rubin will never get the green light . " IF YOU PULL A STUNT like this , " he says from behing his massive , paper . laden desk , " we will lose respect for the prosecution of drugs . Here you try to make an impact and say something is against the law and then the government gives it away . It makes you look like a fool . " I try to put myself in the position of ' a juror in a drug trial , and the first thing a defense attorney will do with an experiment like this going on is to point out that , while his client has been arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government . " If the immunity is granted , says Schwartz , he will try another approach ? " the dirty movies . " " For , " he says , " Dr. Rubin has said the sole purpose of the movies is for sexual arousal , and that 's what obscenity laws are all about . Dr. Rubin has already convicted himself . " As long as I can establish ' probable cause '  --  and I will look for it ? I will seize the film and present the whole matter to the grand jury . I will not shirk my responsibility . " BUT TO ANOTHER man of the law , Chief Kennedy , the project " should be welcomed with open arms . " " Any science study that would help . answer unanswered questions is welcomed by me , " he says . " If I had a series of sex crimes , it would help me to know if I should look less or more at the drug community in solving it . " I have not gotten one call of protest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only calls I get are from reporters . It is much ado about nothing . If this were not a political year , a lot of people who 've jumped on the bandwagon would n't have said.a thing . " At the L a n , ta n a Baptist Church , around the corner from the police department , Rev. Ben Glinn , a big man , with an arm tattoo , is on the phone . " I 'M TALKING ABOUT hard-core pornography , " he says into the phone . " I 'm talking about intercourse , Madam . With women . With animals . Yes , I 'm talking about right here in Carbondale . We do n't need this trash . " He hangs up the phorie and ' continues to talk about Dr. Rubin 's experiment , which he and other members of the Christian Citizens Lobby are fighting . " I challenge that if a person is affected sexually by marijuana it will stop- , them from smoking it . I challenge it ca. , . the grounds of using taxpaSmrs ' money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALWAYS said you never get a skunk to stink until you stir him up . Well , we 've been doing some stirring up around here and it 's starting to stink . " " We get more letters on gun control and stray dogs than we do about the experiment , " says John Gardner , editor of Carbond , ale 's newspaper , The Southern Illinoisan , which has endorsed the project . " I do n't sense any great mass of protest . I personally think it 's ' a question of academic freedom and people ought not to interfere in university research . Some of the opposition seem to feel that you can research some things but not others . " LEONARD DeCLUE , 26 , a graduate student at SIU , is one student who actively opposed it . Four years ago , he stopped smoking pot when " I saw the light . " To him , the project is morally wrong . " Common sense , " he says , " deems it a sin . " But to most students , the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I came up from Florida three months ago , " said one freshman girl , lounging in a stuffed chair in the student center . " I heard about it doWn there . My mother called to ask me about this terrible experiment she 's lead about . " Bbt nobody even discusses it here . Let 's face it . Sitting around talking about sex and pot is just a bit old hat . "
