Except on the coldest days of the Colorado winter , the doors of the Pomona Elementary School annex , on the outskirts of Grand Junction , are opened during recess . The reason is that the building is radioactive . Unless the rooms are aired , radioactive gases and particles seeping through the floors cause the radiation in the school rooms to rise dangerously above safe levels . In fact , during the summer months when the school is closed up , radiation rises to a level 18 times higher than the guideline established by the U.S. Surgeon General . <P> Pomona Elementary 's problem is shared in less acute form by buildings in at least a dozen other Colorado communities and by Grand Junction itself , an important uranium-producing town until the ore petered out in the mid-1960s . The villain is uranium " tailings " - the gray , sandy debris that piled up in small mountains beside the mills as refuse from the mining operations . The tailings were known to contain some residual radiation , but below levels the AEC then considered to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its uranium mines , Grand Junction contractors seized on the tailings as a convenient and cheap source of landfill and concrete mix . Over the years , thousands of tons of tailings went into the construction of schools , homes , commercial buildings , sidewalks , an airfield and a shopping mall . <P> Cleft Palates . By 1961 , says the AEC , " form letters " were mailed to health officials warning that while the agency did not have regulatory jurisdiction over the tailings , their radium content could be hazardous ; health officials , however , claim they never received the letters . In 1966 the Colorado state health department attached test film badges to several buildings in downtown Grand Junction ; the badges promptly turned black from radioactivity . This led the state to pass legislation requiring contractors to get permits before using tailings in any project . <P> In 1970 a pediatrician in Grand Junction , Dr. Robert Ross , noticed an increase in the number of cleft palates and other birth defects in the area , and communicated his concern to Dr. C. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colorado 's Medical Center . Their joint studies , reported last October , indicated that the incidence of cleft lip and palate was almost twice as high in the Grand Junction area as for the rest of Colorado , the birth rate significantly lower , the death rate from congenital anomalies 50% higher . <P> But the town was slow to take alarm . Paul Hathaway , regional editor of Grand Junction 's Daily Sentinel , explains : " Uranium turned this from a sleepy little cow town to a booming city . They accept it as part of their existence . That 's why you do n't see a lot of immediate concern about the tailings . " As Frank Folk , who is principal of a local school , puts it : " I 'd just as soon be here in the clear air with the tailings as in some of those cities with their smog. "
