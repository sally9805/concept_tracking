Smallpox reappears in Britain <P> Time and again the World Health Organization has declared smallpox extinct , only to have the ancient scourge reappear like a genie from a virologist 's flask . Although the last known case of smallpox occurred in Somalia last October , the disease has not died out .

Her father , Frederick Witcomb , 77 , died of an apparent heart attack after learning of his daughter 's illness . Henry Bedson , 48 , head of Birmingham 's microbiology department and official custodian of its smallpox virus , was found with his throat slashed , with no indication of foul play . <P> Because the incident follows a similar one at a London hospital in 1973 that claimed two lives , it confirmed WHO 'S belief that virus labs have become the last major source of smallpox danger . Already WHO has recommended that only five centers in the entire world , including the CDC in Atlanta , be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not one of these , and Bedson had planned to destroy his lethal collection in 1980.
