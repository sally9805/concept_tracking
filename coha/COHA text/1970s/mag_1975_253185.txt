Few things in life are more attractive than an open hearth fire-or less efficient . It is messy , requires continual attention , and sends perhaps as much as 90% of its heat up the chimney with the smoke . Most homeowners learn to live with such flaws . Lawrence Cranberg , an Austin , Tex. , physicist went back to basic physics to correct them . He has designed a fireplace grate that forces a fire not only to burn better but to send more of its heat out into the room . <P> Cranberg turned his attention toward hearth fires last winter ; in an attempt to conserve oil , he supplemented his home heating with his two fireplaces . Frustrated by the inefficiency of a standard three-log fire , he studied what really happened when he poked at the logs to make the fire burn better . His conclusion : " I was opening up a furnace , prying the logs apart a bit or rotating them to expose the hot , charred surface in order to get more heat into the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what physicists call a " black body , " a furnace-like cavity with walls that absorb and then emit practically all the heat and other radiation that reaches them ; only a fraction of the radiation escapes through a small hole in one of the walls . <P> Easy to Light . Applying this concept , Cranberg built the " Texas Fire-frame , " a spindly metal contraption that looks like a standard fireplace grate with two taller uprights at the front corners fitted with adjustable metal arms that extend into the fireplace . To use it , he places a large log toward the rear of the grate , two smaller ones toward the front , and a fourth log , slightly smaller than the first , on the adjustable arms ( see diagram ) . He then lowers the arms until the top log just touches the surface of the large one at the rear . This creates a cavity that opens into the room-a sort of wooden furnace that contains the fire and prevents much of its heat from immediately escaping up the chimney . <P> One product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ; about 30% of the heat generated inside the slot eventually streams out into the room . There is another bonus : it is easy to light . A conventional fire requires a pile of kindling , a few balls of crumpled newspaper and , frequently , several matches before it will catch . Often it burns for half an hour or more before it starts dropping coals and throwing off substantial heat . Because his arrangement traps heat so well , Cranberg can light even damp wood with only a few sheets of newspaper , placed directly in the cavity , and have a hot fire in 15 minutes .
