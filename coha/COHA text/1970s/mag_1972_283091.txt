SEVERAL years ago , Harold Geneen complained about the image of the company that he heads : " You can stop 15 people in the street and not one will know what ITT is . That bothers me . " Geneen hardly has that worry today . ITT is a household name . Everybody who reads the headlines knows that the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp . is the multibillion-dollar firm that quietly agreed to put up at least $100,000 to help finance this year 's Republican National Convention , and shortly thereafter negotiated a controversial settlement in a classic antitrust case . But Geneen 's interests scarcely run to backroom politics . By concentrating on business to the exclusion of almost everything else , including personal life , Geneen has built ITT into the eighth largest U.S.-based industrial concern and the biggest of all multinational conglomerates . <P> The man and the company are really indistinguishable . In an era of colorless hired managers , trim , short-haired Geneen has shaped a corporation that everyone in business identifies with him . When he became its president in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $765 million , but it mostly produced and ran telecommunications systems abroad . Under Geneen , ITT through a dizzying series of acquisitions has become a hotel operator ( Sheraton ) , insurance seller ( Hartford Fire ) , car renter ( Avis ) , baker ( Continental Baking ) , homebuilder ( Levitt ) , as well as a maker of pulp and cellulose and a major shareholder in Comsat . Overseas it has been rolling like Patton 's Third Army into cosmetics , food products , auto parts and construction materials . Last year it employed almost 400,000 people in 67 countries . They generated sales of $7.3 billion , excluding Chilean and insurance operations , and profits of $337 million . <P> Highest Paid . Geneen plays this corporate machine like an organ and tries to keep his fingers on every last key . A trained accountant , he thinks in figures-sales , profits , production , inventories . He requires subordinates round the world to send him reams of detailed reports , which he stuffs into several briefcases for perusal while being chauffeured to and from ITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in meetings with ITT people , and his social engagements are related to business . Though he is perhaps the highest-paid executive in the U.S. ( 1970 salary : $766,755 ) he cares little for good food or wine , custom tailoring or other perquisites , and has no hobbies or compelling outside interests . His second wife June accommodates herself to his single-minded devotion to business . <P> The management structure of ITT is that of a federated empire . Division chiefs are free to run their operations , so long as they can convince Geneen that they are hitting his targets of a 15% compounded growth in profits every year , or have excellent reasons why they can not do so . In order to check , Geneen summons more than 100 lieutenants to two monthly meetings , one in Manhattan and one in Brussels . The meetings , which are exhaustive reviews of all the figures and problems of each division , often last four days and nights .                   @ @
