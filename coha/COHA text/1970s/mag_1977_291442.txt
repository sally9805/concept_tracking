Does the world really need another conductor of Beethoven , Bruckner , Mahler and the other immortals ? If his name is Klaus Tennstedt , the answer is a fortissimo yes . Unknown to the majority of American music lovers , the former East German maestro has become one of the most sought-after guest conductors in the U.S. Watching , the onlooker may wonder why : on the podium the man often resembles a stoned stork . Hearing his music is another matter : Tennstedt elicits a sound with the startling ring of rightness . Indeed , his musical logic may be the most profound since the late Otto Klemperer 's . Yet as opposed to the monolithic stasis that sometimes afflicted Klemperer , Tennstedt 's energy is a constant refreshment . Leading an epic Bruckner Seventh Symphony with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra two weeks ago , or a steely , gleaming Prokofiev Fifth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic last week , Tennstedt presented a rare fusion of intelligence and passion . <P> Tennstedt is 50 . To the young Turks of the conducting life , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breed , it is mere adolescence . To Tennstedt , it is an age at which everything falls into place . Born in Merseburg , Germany , Klaus took up the violin at the age of eight ; by 22 he was concertmaster at the municipal theater in Halle . When a nerve disorder damaged a finger of the left hand several years later , he turned to conducting . At 32 he became music director of the Dresden Opera . There were , later on , tours of the U.S.S.R. , Czechoslovakia and other Eastern bloc countries . But recalls Tennstedt : " For any musician , travel was restricted , and there were so few possibilities for growth . Modern music from the West was off limits . East Germany has many composers , but very few good ones . Nor does it have many good orchestras . " <P> It all became unbearable to the maestro , and in 1971 he slipped out to Sweden on a carelessly stamped exit visa . He soon signed on as general music director of the Kiel Opera , then picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. debut in December 1974 , conducting the Boston Symphony in Brahms and Bruckner . The complex , granitic Eighth Symphony of Bruckner was hardly an easy choice for a newcomer , but the performance made it clear that a conductor of the first rank had arrived . The Boston had not sounded so brilliant in years . Subsequent appearances - topped by a prodigious Beethoven Ninth Symphony last summer at Tanglewood - confirmed his reputation .
