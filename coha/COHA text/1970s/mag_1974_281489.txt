Betty Ford faced her own credibility gap last week : how to be a President 's wife and a thinking human being . Courageously establishing a precedent-the first fullscale , open-admission press conference to be given by a First Lady - Mrs . Ford tried hard to avoid ideological traps . Wearing a mustard shirtdress , she gracefully fielded the mandatory housekeeping questions . Inflation had hit the Fords , she acknowledged : " We do n't eat as much steak or roast beef as the boys would like . " And she spoke to Moms everywhere : " I 'm dumbfounded the children have adjusted so well to the change . " But after she nailed her colors to the Equal Rights Amendment , she slipped . She indicated support for Vice President-designate Rockefeller 's controversial stand pro liberalized abortion laws . Next day her press secretary Helen Smith issued an equivocation . Mrs. Ford believes abortion is justified , she backpedaled , but it should not be given on demand . <P> Musing on the qualifications necessary for a President last week , Eugene McCarthy opined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to go to bat for you ?

Invited to join George Plimpton , Peter Mathiessen and Wilfrid Sheed on the writers ' team in an annual charity softball game between writers and artists , Poet McCarthy went three for three against strong opposition that included Fabric Designer Boris Kroll and Painters Syd Solomon and Jimmy Ernst . One line drive could have been a home run if McCarthy had not stumbled at first base . His team went down 10-1 , but Gene did not finish . When a pinch runner replaced him in the fifth inning , everyone laughed at the public address announcement : " McCarthy has chosen not to run . " <P> Bonanza may no longer be filling prime time on TV , but the spirit of the Ponderosa gallops on . Big Ben Cartwright rode into Washington last week to lobby for some of the constituents of Ponderosa ranch : horses . Along with Papa Charcoal , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a press conference opposite the White House , asking for legislation to curb the cruelties inflicted on horses in the U.S. Greene , who has his own ranch in California 's San Fernando Valley , has joined the board of the A.H.P.A. Said one fan who had gathered round to give Papa Charcoal a pat , " and he is n't hossing around . "
