Over the past five years , the Metropolitan Museum of Art , one of the half-dozen greatest cultural institutions in the U.S. , has had its share of troubles . Some came from outside : money was short and the cost of everything from ink pads to Guercinos had shot up , threatening the museum 's power to collect or even administer itself on its old scale . Other problems were internal . There was friction between the scholarly and populist interests within the Met . A troublesome gap existed between the trustees and the curatorial staff . To those outside its doors , the board room looked like ( and was ) an in frangible Herrenklub in whose deliberations no voices but those of managerial capitalism could be heard . <P> And then there was the man who , in the public eye , " was " the Met : its director since 1967 , Thomas Pearsall Field Hoving-a paragon of arrogance and talent who appeared to his numerous supporters as the man who saved the Met by doubling its audience ( to 3.3 million in 1974-75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among living museum directors , Hoving had an unsurpassed flair for theatrical gesture , coupled with a Nixonian capacity for " toughing it out " in moments of crisis . <P> Cold Dish . Both abilities were tested to the limit three years ago in the " de-accessioning " scandals , when Hoving and the museum were plunged into controversy over works of art the Met had sold to buy others . It was feared that this practice , unbridled , would weaken the museum 's encyclopedic collection . <P> In the background was unease about the secrecy of the Met 's actions and the smokescreens spewed forth to hide them . So the New York Times , like Mozart 's marmoreal Commendatore , came for Tom Giovanni , and down the trap door he nearly went , carrying some of the museum 's prestige with him . But Hoving did not go down . The Met , rebuked by New York 's attorney general , came out with a clear and cautionary set of guidelines for de-accessioning in 1973 , and the issue died . <P> Revenge , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So with Hoving 's reply to his critics , which opened this month at the Metropolitan . Entitled " Patterns of Collection : Selected Acquisitions 1965-75 , " it sets before us a selection of 350 works of art from the 20,000 or so objects the Met has acquired in the past decade . The task of organizing it has been brilliantly performed by Olga Raggio . The aim is to show in detail how the process of acquisition works , what kinds of object it affects , and to what overriding policy it relates . In short , the Met is being relatively frank-even to the point of naming the dealers from whom it bought the pieces . <P> Anyone who supposes the collecting enterprise comes down to phoning Wildenstein and ordering a Monet or two will be in for some interesting revelations . Perhaps no museum show any where has ever been so explicit about the means and problems of running a collection : the rarity of material , the formal minuets danced between the enamored curator and the skeptical trustee , the checks and balances . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this show makes its points tellingly.
