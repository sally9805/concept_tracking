txt JUST WHEN you think our consciousness here in America can not be raised any higher than it 's already been , along comts a great new social pioneer like Joe Bruno . Bruno has stepped into wrist nas always been , if you will , a cause without . a rebel . He is out to end , for now and forever , the abominable practice by which men are barred from membership in all-women 's organizations . One could say that nobody cares . But that is the point . Consciousness must be raised . Sexism must be overcome . Bruno has scored a direct hit in this era of reverse discrimination suits . Let 's look at the facts . BRUNO , WHOSE own sartorial tastes run to velvet suits , is a 46-year-old fashion designer with Huntington Industries , a Chicago-based garment manufacturer which produces women 's apparel at moderate prices . It sells to mail-order hares like Spiegel 's , and retail outlets like J. C. Penney 's . His clothes are not Calvin Kleins , or Halstons , but Bruno does go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Lyon great couturiers , for inspiration . For years he has longed to join an exclusively female professional organization called The Fashion Group . The Fashion Group is an international association , incorporated in 1931 , which has thousands of members and 32 regional units worldwide . It is only open to women executives within the fashion industry . Its stated purpose is to act as an " international clearinghouse " for the exchange of information on such things as tastes and trends , with coordination of the findings " to provide forecasting in these areas . " A related objective is " to encourage cooperation among Those en // - 11110 From page one Rebel 's cause in fashion // gaged In conceiving , designing , manufacturing , promoting , and distributing fashion goods and services . " THE ORGANIZATION has considera:hie prestige and influence . It publishes a weekly bulletin . Its local chapters hold monthly informational meetings , sponsor fashion shows , and bring in guest speakers . All ' in all , Bruno says , membership would enhance him professionally in the fashion community . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a decorator , you want ASID American Socieety of- Interior Decorating after your name . I 'm . a designer and I 'd like to belong to The Fashion Group . " I also feel I have very many good ideas to contribute . For men and women to sit down and exchange ideas is healthy . I do n't plan to take over The Fashion Group . I just plan to be a part of it and express my ideas . " BRUNO IS VICE president of another trade association , The Fashion Guild of Chicago . He also serves on the board of advisers to Harper College 's fashion program . But its not enough . fie says , he will not rest until he 's admitted to The Fashion Group . The yearning , he confesses , goes back to his neophyte days . " I ca n't explain , " he says . " When I was young and starting out , The Fashion Group was . . . wow , it was like . seeing movie stars . That 's corny , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belong . " He tried to join , he says , and was rudely turned down . That was many years ago , and , if you believe him , he 's carried the pain within his breast for all this time . But this year his fire was rekindled , and he 's mounted a public campaign for admission . " Listen , these days women are trying to break into all kinds of exclusive male societies , " he says . " They want into the Union League Club , for example . There are 170 women attending West Point this year . There are female policemen . Female basketball players . Women are I seeking equal opportunity to express themselves in whatever their type of work . " Well , I do n't want to hear how women want to join a men 's club when I ca n't join a women 's club . " BRUNO INSISTS he 'll sue if he has to . But he 'd prefer to use noninflammatory methods . Tribune Photo by Karen Engstrom Fashion designer Joe Bruno : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just plan to be a part of it . . . . " " I feel like Martin Luther King , " he says . " A peaceful attitude is better than a violent one , like suing . It took King a long time to get where he did , but he accomplished it . " Quite honestly , I was n't very moved by all this at first . In fact , I thought it a shade ridiculous . But that was before I casually mentioned the issue to women Who belong to The Fashion Group . Amazingly enough , their remarks sounded uncomfortably like the mindless , snobbish , vicious remarks men make about pushy women trying to invade male dominions . " JOE BRUNO ? HE 'S an idiot , " shrieked a Fashion Group member of my acqlmintance . She followed with a totally uncalled for crack about Bruno 's masculinity . " He just wants to get his name in the papers , " she raged . " We have no objection to men joining . Nobody wants to keep them out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected . " Look , why do you bother talking to Joe Bruno ? " she sneered . " He 's small peanuts . Did you ever hear of Huntington Industries ? Huh ? " I said I had n't . She looked at me imperiously . " There you are , " she said . " They do n't make fashions . They make ... " her lips quivered with distaste " ... clothes . " TERRY . DUFKA is regional director of The Fashion Group . She said the New York executive office has two committees studying the issue of admitting men to membership . " New York asked our local group to sample how our members feel , " she said . " I 'd say the results are running about 60-40 in favor . " I do n't think anybody ever thought of The Fashion Group as being discriminatory . It was just founded by women for women , like the DAR . We do ' have men who work closely with us , you know . We almost look upon them as honorary members . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Eleanor , Fashion Group executive director , questioned Bruno 's motives . " We 've had this happen in other places , and the motivation was publicity , " she said . " Could Mr. Bruno be a publicity hound ? " This was beginning to sound like Mayor Daley discussing " outside agitators . " Mrs. said the issue is under study . Then she became sanguine , almost plantation-like in tone . " I do n't think , " she said , " that men have been cut out of The Fashion Group . We love the men . . I bend over backwards trying to be nice to the men in the industry . " But The Fashion Group , she said . is " a showcase lor what women can do " in an industry she ' says is heavily dominated by men . For that reason , she confided , " We may be giving up more than we 're gaining if we let them in . " So that 's what we are , eh , brothers ? We 're " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you .
