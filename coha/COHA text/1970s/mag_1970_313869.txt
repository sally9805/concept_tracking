OWL by William Service . 92 pages . Knopf. $4 . <P> " The ancients , " writes William Service , " attributed to the owl great wisdom . I , more careful , attribute to him the keenest appetite to find things out . " The same might be said of Service himself . His Owl is less the result of wisdom than of a keen if bemused curiosity . No man can know all about a bird , especially a screech owl who possesses , as the book jacket puts it , the proportions of a beer can and the personality of a bank president . But a year of open-minded daily contact with such a creature is bound to lead to something , and in this case it has led to one of the most elegant and perceptive pieces of nature writing since T. H. White fell in with a goshawk . <P> Owl ( his name as well as his kind ) arrived in the already pet-filled Service household in a coffee can borne by children . He had apparently tumbled out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his general incompetence in such matters by repeatedly walking off the edge of a table . Too little to be abandoned once more to the hazards of the woods , he stayed , ate eagerly and soon learned to fly and hunt . He also solved the family cat and dog problem . Chirring fiercely , he fixed them with a furious yellow stare and threw a hex on them . " The animal which looks back at you with two eyes at once , " maintains Service , " tends to stand high in the local food chain , i.e. , not one of nature 's victims . " <P> Owl scrupulously avoids the fallen archness common among animal books . Service is fascinated by Owl as owl , not homunculus , and comes forth with a number of unexpected facts about the species . Owls ' eyes , for example , do not move in their sockets . And Owl , Service found , could not see his own feet , or focus on anything closer than eight or ten inches away . For all Service could tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dimmest light Owl could spot a small moth 20 feet away-if it moved , and provided he was hungry . <P> The author admits to the impossibility of considering Owl without indulging in a certain amount of anthropomorphism- " he postures too much ; he walks about hobbling like an old man with hands clasped behind back . " But as a fair observer , Service , a writer and amateur naturalist , points out that human logic is n't much help in understanding a screech owl . For one thing , how do you know what the bird is thinking when , say , he shreds a piece of spinach into 55 fragments before leaving it ? Or why he reacts with evident horror to the sight of an upright moving stick ? Or why , though something of a gourmet , Owl once consumed a lucky rabbit 's foot down to the metal clip ? " Since I ca n't get a reasonable answer , I suggest he does n't know why himself , " observes Service , adding judiciously : " Perhaps he is losing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day with no more warning than had marked his arrival . In the family 's routine he left " a very small blank-precisely owl-shaped . " Service 's very small book is not precisely owl-shaped , but it serves most excellently to fill a blank in an attentive reader 's life that hardly anyone would suspect was there .
