THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Commen THE other day , we received the following letter from a young man we know : Heloise Bowles , the premier household-hints columnist of all time , died at the end of 1977 , and I was sorry to hear it , because I liked her a lot . I actually knew her only through her column , " Hints from Heloise " ( the most widely syndicated column in the world ) , and from things that people wrote about her , but in 1967 I saw a Life article that had a big color picture of her in a Shivalike pose with different kinds of mops and brooms behind her as arms and , on the following pages , had an interview in which she said , more or less out of the blue , " I 'd like to meet that German who invented that cannon to shoot dumplings that 's right , dump-lings  --  up at planes that flew so near his house the noise made him mad , " and after that I felt I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a different kind of attention . Sometimes a really good hint in " Heloise " was capable of arousing a pleasure in me so intense as to border on the aesthetic . Within the last year , one of her readers brought up the problem of devilled eggs , and how they always slide together in a disorganized mass after they are put on a tray . This is not , as problems go , a major problem , but it is in fact a problem  --  one that anyone who has ever served devilled eggs knows about . The solution to the problem which the column came up with was to cut off the bottom of the egg halves to create a flat surface for them to rest upon . I tried this and found that shaving just a little piece off the bottom of half a devilled egg is a skill in itself , worthy of its own guild-and-trade magazine , but maybe I did it wrong . One of her hints that went immediately into my life to stay was the idea of washing out paper coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing them away . This is easy to do , works fine , and is as satisfying , in a certain way , as it would be to have a cannon that shot dumplings at airplanes . Often , I would read her column just for its atmosphere , and there are hints I have no use for that I remember just because I like them : putting girdles in the refrigerator so they 'll go on easier ; mending cigarette burns in cashmere sweaters with a fine needle and human hair ; cutting thick foam rubber with an electric carving knife ; protecting your necktie while you 're eating on an airplane by slipping the plastic wrapper the silverware came in over it ; removing lint balls from clothing with a razor . Sometimes , one of her hints would be like a window in an Easter egg  --  you 'd look through and find a whole , luminous scene , a view of a world complete and utopian . Heloise 's idea of what the world should be like was so strong and so clear to her that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people tended to think of her as a conservative , when ecology came along she was ready for it ( she knew all about saving things and reusing them ) , and she colored her hair blue and green and purple fifteen years before that became a punk-rock fad . Besides all this , Heloise was probably the most affectionate columnist who has ever written . She was always praising her readers , thanking them profusely for their suggestions , and telling them she loved them , and her readers returned her love . Her daughter , Heloise II ( Ponce Cruse ) , who had been working with her mother on the column for several years , is doing a fine job , and I hope there will he a Heloise III and a Heinise IV , and that the column will go on for a long time . I have right at hand one of the many Heloise columns I have clipped and saved over the years , and its first sentence is a good example of Heloise 's best writing , and of the kind of discourse she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How about sitting a spell while we talk about salad bowls ? " In the newspaper , you rarely find a more comfortable invitation , ANEW ENGLAND correspondent writes : We do n't often have deep snow here in southern Rhode Island . When it comes , it changes everyone 's life , but it is hard for me to think of it as a disaster . Difficult , perhaps , but not a disaster . Nevertheless , whenever two or three more snowflakes than usual fall on our little state the politicians get on the phone to Washington asking for emergency aid , and for several evenings the news is full of talk about our being a " disaster area . " The words are delivered in sepulchral , almost reverent tones . The reverence may be induced by the thought of all the money that will fall on us like warm , green snowflakes if Washington decides to its mind on this point , I conducted my own survey of the effects of the heavy snow . I covered a limited area , bounded by the shopping center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my snow-covered orchard and barnyard . I began at the shopping center , and , for what it 's worth , I can report that the place looked absolutely normal . The bleak expanses of parking lots were just as bleak and grimy as on any other day , and only a bit slushier . Within the supermarket , the shelves and aisles were crammed with things and people , as they always are . Under the fluorescent lights , the fruits and vegetables shone with strange , unnatural colors , as they always do . As far as I 'm concerned , the only disaster is that the shopping center is there at all , in place of the general stores of yesteryear . Anyway , Washington , I do n't think you need send help to the shopping center . I found the post office also looking normal . The flag was flying . A man was hacking ice off the steps . There was , as usual , no place to park , and I had to leave my car a block away . However , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delayed . Whether this rates as a disaster depends on what is in the Times , and I will have to postpone judgment until my copy finally comes . I visited the ocean by driving south a few miles on Route 1 and turning off on the Moonstone Beach Road , which conies to a dead end beside one of a series of salt ponds with which our area is blessed . Disaster looms over these ponds , but it has nothing to do with snow . The New England Power Company wants to build a nuclear power plant alongside one of them . The ponds are wonderful winter havens for water birds . As usual , I found several bird-watchers scanning the frozen distances with field glasses . I stopped to talk with a man wearing a blue cap and a plaid lumberjacket , who gave me the exciting news that " the smew " had returned . Smews are little white diving ducks that normally live in Northern Europe and Siberia . They sometimes visit Alaska but are otherwise almost unheard of in the United States . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newport , just across the hay from us . How it got there no one knew . It just blew in . It flew off in Apnl , and had not been reported since . Well , the man told me , just two weeks before the big storm a smew was spotted on Quonochontaug Pond , a bit southwest of Moonstone Beach . The news spread , and joyous birders flocked to welcome the distinguished visitor . There is no way to be sure , but everyone believes this to be the smew of ' 76 , and its return is considered a fine testimonial to our neighborhood . The smew must have found the great snowfall delightfully homelike , and after the storm passed it was seen bobbing happily on the icy waters . I thanked the man for telling me all this , and crossed the dunes to have a look at the ocean . The ocean was looking wonderful . The water was as clear and as green as bottle glass . The beach was as neat as a pin , the sand smooth and clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bathing cap and Clorox bottle buried or carried out to sea . In their place was some interesting driftwood . I hope Washington will note that the ocean in our area has never been better . Back home , I found my first evidence of disaster : a dead blue jay lying stiff under a big tree . I picked him up and examined him for cause of death . I could find no sign , and put the body back on the snow . His surviving companions , clustered at the bird feeder , all looked strong and healthy . At the front door , I found a second disaster  --  the oil bill that the deliveryman had eft tucked into the doorjamb while I was out . I put it on my desk . Early the next morning , in bright sunshine , I resumed my survey . I found that the snow around the house was of a tricky and difficult depth . If I could ski , it would have been perfect . But since I ca n't I had to be content with a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable , breaking through the thin crust . Looking down at the glittering whiteness beneath my feet , I could see that I was not the first abroad . Where the wind had blown the snow to lesser depths , the roofs of mouse-made tunnels were visible , forming wandering patterns like veins . I paused to wonder about the vista inside the tunnels from the point of view of the mice . Is there icy-blue light when the sun shines through , or is the light golden ? I imagine that the walls of the snow tunnels look a bit like the white rile in the Holland Tunnel , but that , unlike the Holland Tunnel , a mouse tunnel is filled with clean , white air . There is no engine roar , and only an occasional squeak at traffic intersections . One of the ways mice survive in snow is to eat bark from young trees  --  especially from expensive fruit trees . I noted that several tunnels led in the direction of apple trees I 'd planted last spring . Rurpee sells plastic collars to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgot to put them on . I am chalking up the probable apple-tree disaster to my own carelessness , and am not asking for help from Washington . Floundering on to the stable , I rounded a corner and surprised a fox snoozing on the manure pile . This , I realized , must be the warmest spot in town . Its internal heat , plus its steep slope and the sun on its dark surface , had melted the snow , creating a sort of Red Fox Riviera . It seems foxes have known about alternate energy sources all along . Reluctantly , the fox got up , shook himself , and trotted off lightly on the delicate crust of the snow . No floundering for him . His coat was a lovely shade of orange . He was beautifully made : long , slender legs , slender body , elegant brush . He paused behind a bush to stare at me and then moved on . I hoped he had found the dead blue jay and had it for breakfast . That evening , I was pleased when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newscast . The governor , it said , had withdrawn his request for federal aid , and Rhode Island was n't a disaster area after all . ? a Tams THE members of the junior auxiliary of the Human Zamboni have some strong opinions about what constitutes suitable ice-skating music . Specifically , they contend that Barry White 's " It 's Ecstasy When You Lay Down Next to Me " or the Bar-Kays ' new single " Let 's Have Some Fun " makes for more enjoyable skating than , say , organ solos of " The Impossible Dream " or " Strangers in the Night . " The Zamboni is a highly maneuverable vehicle , about the size of a small tractor , that is used to smooth the surface of skating rinks . Madison Square Garden owns a Zamboni ; Rockefeller Center has one ; the Wollman Memorial Rink , at the southern end of Central Park , has one , and so does the Kate Wollman Memorial Rink , in Prospect Park , in Brooklyn . Any public skating rink that does not have a Zamboni can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lasker Rink , at the northern end of Central Park , lacks something . On the other hand , Lasker has the Human Zamboni . At the conclusion of each skating session , a crew of a half-dozen city employees -- al/ of them skating guards at Lasker  --  take to the ice and skim the worn surface with broad-bladed shovels . This is the Human Zamboni in action . The task requires about fifteen minutes of skating and skimming . Following that , the ice receives a light spray of hot water , which leaves the surface almost as slick as if it had been mechanically Zambonied . On weekends and after school , the Human Zamboni is augmented by a group of eight Harlem teen-agers who wear red or blue hooded sweatshirts inscribed , with metallic iron-on letters . " LASKER SKATE CREW . " The members of the Skate Crew are the Human Zamboni 's junior auxiliary . Clinton Johnson , the head foreman of the Lasker Rink , does not charge the Skate Crew any admission fee to skate there . This turns out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Skate Crew members are not Zamboniing they are running Lasker 's sound system . During an ? afternoon session one recent Sunday , James Brown , a high-school senior , who is the unofficial leader of the Skate Crew , was seated in a room one story above the rink . In front of him were two record turntables , an amplifier , a record-cuing machine , and a microphone . The microphone is for making public announcements and for broadcasting the rules of the rink . ( " No speed-skating . No horseplay . No sitting on the rails . No smoking on the ice . Etc . " ) James wore a pair of stereo earphones and was tapping his skate blades to the tune of Southroad Connection 's " You Like It , We Love It ( Just Laying It Down ) , " which was playing on the left-hand turntable . At intervals , he would cue a record on the right-hand turntable and mix in sound effects from other albums . Out on the ice , a crowd of a hundred or so moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the percussion . Al Haygood and Angelo ( Pete ) Colon , two especially dexterous skating guards , back-slid and twisted . They moved their hands and feet a great deal but made no discernible forward progress . They were dancing . " This place is like , you know  --  well , every other rink has what I call nos- ? falgic music , " said James . " Here we have what the majority of the people want to hear , what they like . " He had temporarily finished with Southroad Connection and had cued a cut by the I3lackbyrds called " City Life . " " The tape system here has n't worked for a while . People were just skating with music from the radio . All of us on the Skate Crew have been skating here for a long time . We were trying to figure out how to make the rink more fun , and we came up with the idea of bringing in our own record-player and records . The thing we 're aiming for is non-stop music . Making it happen all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life even briefer than an Italian government 's , the members of the Skate Crew do their best to make certain that the record collection at Lasker is constantly replenished . " It 's just a matter of hitting the record stores , listening to the radio , and knowing what 's hot , " said James , who then showed us what he called the jams  --  the top new tunes of the week . The jams included " The Force , " by Kool &; the Gang ; " Supernature , " by Cerrone ; " Maximum Stimulation , " by the Jimmy Castor Bunch ; " Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome , " by Parliament ; " Sons of the Gods , " by Ripple ; and " Cocomotion , " by El Coco  --  al of which will presumably be useless relics by the time the spring thaw arrives . After about twenty minutes at the controls , James turned the headset over to his younger brother , Alonzo . With proper fraternal loyalty , Alonzo candidly acknowledges that James is the best d. j. at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Skate Crew  --  Darryl Smith , Keith Josephs , Andre Johnson , Kevin Robinson , David Jones , and Wendell Ferguson  --  are n't also pretty good . While Alonzo sat at the turntable controls , the rest of the Skate Crew wandered in and out of the room . James stuck his head in at the door at one point and shouted , " Play some jams , man ! We got all these jams that nobody 's hearing out there ! " Alonzo cued up " Le Spank , " by a group called Le Pamplemousse , and while it was blaring he mixed in the synthetic sound of a waterfall , from Kraftwerk 's " Trans Europe Express , " and then the sound of ghoulish laughter , from the Bar-Kays ' " Whitehouse Orgy . " " The trick is in the mixing , " said Alonzo . " You 've got to make the afternoon sound like one record . One continuous record . " " We call this Station WBSR , " said Darryl Smith . " World 's Best Skating Rink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supermarket music , " added Andre Johnson . " When you skate there , you 're just skating . When you skate here , you move . " This last remark suggested that , in obedience to the strictures of the equal-time doctrine , we had better head for the other end of the park and pay a visit to the Wollman Rink , where none of the members of the Lasker Skate Crew would be caught dead . We went to Wollman that same afternoon , and sought out Al Manolt , the foreman , who happened to be in a philosophic mood . " I 've been working with ice twenty-three years now , " said Mr. Manelt , who has wavy gray hair and a goatee and wears sunglasses on clear days to reduce ice glare . " It 's a wonderful challenge . You 're breaking your chops all the time . The hardest part is the music . You 'll satisfy a certain proportion of the population but not the rest . Especially the figure-skating crowd that we get here , the dedicated skaters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over well here  --  not with our clientele . " During our conversation with Mr. Manolt , a long-playing tape machine in his office rolled out organ arrangements of " Cabaret , " " Strangers in the Night , " " Lara 's Theme , " " Cotton-fields , " " On a Clear Day ( You Can See Forever ) , " " Edelweiss " ? in other words , skating music . Most of Wollman 's skating music , we learned , comes to New York by way of Leavenworth , Kansas , where a man named Jerry Baker records it on a Wurlitzer organ in his basement . Mr. Baker has been doing this for twenty years now  --  not quite as long as Al Manolt has been working with ice but long enough to know better than to try to capture the Bee Gees ' latest jam on the Wurlitzer . We spoke with him by telephone the other day , and he said that he plans to give up recording skating music soon , but that he will stick with waltzes , foxtrots , polkas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bowing out of the skating-music business will enable him to devote more attention to his new job , at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth , where he is the staff organist . Ask Mayor Koch ON the Sunday after the big snow , we dropped by the WCBS radio studios around one-thirty in the after-noon for a firsthand look at " Ask May-or Koch , " a question-and-answer show that may establish our new mayor as the first New York politician since LaGuardia to make effective use of the airwaves . The intimacy of radio suits the Mayor 's relaxed , rather garru-lous style , and the program 's format ? callers were screened , but questions and answers were unrehearsed  --  per-mitted Mr. Koch to display his formidable grasp of municipal government and his outrage at various city ripoffs . He spoke for two hours without a note , and seemed to enjoy every minute of it , although there were moments when his press secretary , Maureen Con-nelly , looked uneasy . The callers were critical but polite , and the questions ranged from personal problems ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pothole , a de-layed police promotion ) to citywide issues ( redlining by hanks , education-al reform , the control of illegal pros-titution and pornography , crime in the subways ) and more general topics . ( One woman asked the Mayor to stop assigning male and female police offi-cers to the same patrol car , because it would inevitably lead to sex . The May-or disagreed . Another woman wanted to know why the Mayor had n't made more Irish appointments , because , the woman said , " we voted for you . " The Mayor replied that his appointments were n't made on an ethnic basis , and then cited Police Commissioner Robert McGuire and Miss Connelly . ) The dominant themes of the afternoon were economy and efficiency in government and the old problem of making large municipal agencies more responsive to individual needs . To one caller Mr. Koch said , " My job is to cut city expenses by a hundred and seventy-four million dollars . We 're going to reduce the payroll twenty thousand by attrition . If we reach the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To another Ile said , " Is n't it ridiculous that we give police officers two days off to give a pint of blood ? Now I think it 's been reduced on the new contract to one day off . I just do n't think it 's right at all . I think we should do what an ordinary citizen does : if you want to give blood , give it on your own time . Just because we 've been ripped off in the past does n't mean that we can continue to be ripped off . " To a third he said , " I will not stand by and allow the city to let sixty per cent of the children read at less than grade level . I want the power to hire and fire the chancellor and the top people at the Board of Education . If at the end of a suitable period the children are not reading and writing with adequate skills , I want to be able to say ' You 're out ! ' " The show took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end for the control room , a double row of chairs at the other for the press , and a triangular table in the center which was equipped with microphones and a pitcher of water . The Mayor , looking dapper in a brownand-beige plaid sports jacket , a pinkand-white striped shirt , a navy tie , beige slacks , and brown shoes under rubbers , arrived fifteen minutes before air time and sat down at the table to give the engineer a voice level . " This is Mayor Koch , " said Mayor Koch . " I 'm glad to be here . I think this is my first radio show since the election . Maureen 's been keeping me off the air , because she 's afraid . " " ' We 'll see who 's right after the performance , " said Miss Connelly , a pretty , dark-haired woman , who was sitting at the Mayor 's right . " I promise not to read the comics , " said the Mayor , shaking hands with Rob Sunde , the producer , and Lou Adler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sustain this show for two hours ? " " Frawley , Rotltwick , and Kellerman . They have the bomb . " ? " Absolutely , " said Mr. Adler . " We can take about twenty-five questions , and we 've already had several hundred calls . " " But what if I say ' No comment , no comment ' ? " the Mayor asked , with a smile . " Five minutes to air time , " said a voice from the control room . We asked Mr. Sunde how calls were being handled , and he explained that they were coming in on a special number , which had a choke arrangement . " This prevents an overload of the phone system which could jam several nearby exchanges , " he said . ( The phone company reported later that about forty-two thousand calls were placed , of which five hundred were actually answered at the station . ) " We have ten people answering phones . They write down each caller 's name , address , phone number , and question on a white slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets started , phone the callers back and keep four of them on hold for 1,011 Adler to choose from . So far , sixty per cent of the calls have been about snow removal , but we 're going to use only two on the air , so that there will be a broad range of subj'ects discussed . We 're also on a fifteen-second tape delay to prevent abusive language . " At 2:02 P . NT. , the Mayor began responding to questions . He leaned back in his chair and gazed at the ceiling as the caller 's voice came , amplified , into the studio . Then , as he answered , he turned to face the reporters . Two hours and thirty-four questions later , he slumped down in his chair , stuck out his tongue in mock fatigue , and said , " I 'm exhausted , but I enjoyed it immensely . " Mr. Sunde came in to say that there were two callers -- Cindy Grossman , aged eight , and a Mr. Sidney Heilman who were still on hold . The Mayor picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Sure , you can come down to City Hall when we have a Town Hall Meeting . Write to Maureen Connelly and she 'll arrange it .... Hi , Mr. How 'd I do ? You can ask inc anything . " He listened for a moment , and said , " I 'll certainly include that in my discussion of the subject . " Turning to the press , he said that the caller had asked him to explain to Senator Proxmire the importance of New York 's cultural institutions . " How 's the snow removal going ? " asked a reporter . " The Sanitation Department is doing a magnificent job with meagre resources , " replied the Mayor . " You know , a snowstorm is like any other natural calamity . You 've got to enjoy it even when it hurts . " " What kind of a reception do you expect in Washington ? " asked another reporter . " I hope it will he fair , " said the Mayor , looking sombre for a moment . " When you get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think they 'll provide it . " " How do you feel about your job now ? " asked a third . " We 've run the gamut from snowstorm to budget in the first twenty-two days , " said the Mayor , " and if you make it through the first twenty-two days you have a pretty good chance of getting through the first four months . " " Where are you going now ? " asked a young woman , who had observed that the Mayor was n't wearing a coat . " To the movies , " said Mr. Koch , flashing his puckish grin . " And I wo n't tell you which one . "
