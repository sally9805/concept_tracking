txt Heading for an American-drafted peace treaty even crucial moderates such as Saudi Arabia can not openly back , Egypt has launched a traveling sales mission to head off outright ostracism by the Arab world . On the home front , senior officials sought to stress that the treaty they now hope to sign in Washington by March 23 was a lot stronger than fellow Arabs suspected ? particularly on the question of " linkage " with autonomy for the Palestinians . At stake , ultimately , in Egypt 's diplomatic offensive was President Carter 's bid to make the Egyptian-Israeli pact the cornerstone for overall Middle East peace ? not a spark for fresh violence between Arab opponents of the pact and Israel . // From page 1 Egypt ' peace ' envoys For sale , in effect , was Mr. Carter 's credibility ? the idea that Washington 's " full partnership " in negotiations can persuade Israel to meet fundamental Arab demands it has consistently refused so far . Stressing what they termed a United States commitment to remain directly involved in talks on Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Israel would be a credible springboard for ' comprehensive " peace . For nearly all Egypt 's fellow Arabs , the argument seemed unsalable for the time being . As Vice-President Hosni Mobarak flew into Saudi Arabia for talks on the planned peace pact , Cairo officials from the Prime Minister downward were acknowledging to reporters that immediate support ? even from Arab moderates ? seemed out of the question . Mr. Mobarak also visited neighboring Sudan , one of Egypt 's few Arab backers , and was to tour some European capitals as well . The Cairo government , meanwhile , sent notes of explanation on the planned treaty to most Arab governments . " If I may be blunt , there is no prospect even Saudi Arabia will support the treaty in the short run , " a Foreign Ministry official said . Egypt 's immediate hope was that the Saudis would simply give the treaty a chance and stop short of either outright rejection , or a cutoff in crucial financial aid for the battered Egyptian economy . The long-range hope of both Egypt and the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dynamic of its own ? that the Israelis might gradually soften opposition to certain Arab demands , and that Saudi Arabia then would put its political and financial muscle behind the negotiations . Jordan , another moderate state that is dependent on Saudi aid , theoretically might follow suit . But even Egyptian Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil , speaking to US television , hinted the prospect remained a long shot . If Saudi Arabia and Jordan did slowly come along , he suggested , it would be on the basis of " what we achieve " during the negotiating process on the Palestinians . If support from moderates seemed a long way off , the prospect of backing from hard-liners such as Syria and the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) were even more remote . In a sign of pique , pragmatism , or both , Egypt left the more radical Arabs ? Syria , the PLO , Libya , Algeria , and South Yemen ? off the mailing list for the explanatory note on its peace treaty . " They the hard-liners will howl and shout anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that can counter their outcry is time . " But the Egyptians clearly believed that time was on their side . In what could be the opening salvo of a " war of leaks " between two Middle East adversaries on the treaty homestretch , senior Egyptian officials were insisting March 14 that , particularly on linkage , Israel had accepted their fundamental demands . In return , Egypt agreed to drop the concrete incentive for the Israelis to meet these " target dates " ? a refusal to trade ambassadors until autonomy was implemented . " But linkage is still there , is still very real , " an Egyptian official said . " If it were not , we would not even bother with a diplomatic initiative to explain the treaty to the Arab world . " As Mr. Carter spoke on the tarmac at Cairo Airport , journalists schooled in objectivity and cynicism applauded . Veteran US Embassy officials mumbled and stared in disbelief . One Egyptian journalist dropped his hands numbly to his side and whispered , " I ca n't believe it , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
