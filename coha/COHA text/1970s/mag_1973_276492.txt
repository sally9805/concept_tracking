By the time President Nixon ordered the resumption of bombing over Hanoi and Haiphong on Dec. 18 , B-52 Pilot Michael Heck , 30 , had racked up more than 150 bombing missions during a number of stints in Indochina , a Distinguished Flying Cross , the Air Medal with eleven oakleaf clusters-and an impressive list of reservations about the Viet Nam War . With each new bombing run over the populated cities of the North , those doubts grew . Finally , on the day after Christmas , Heck announced to his wing commander that he could no longer in good conscience participate in the intensified bombing campaign . <P> According to the Pentagon 's records , four other American pilots have refused to go on combat flights since the U.S. began regular bombing missions over Indochina eight years ago ; but Heck 's case was the first to come to public attention , and it took on special significance because of the moral issue raised by the raids . <P> The military bent over backward to explain Heck 's actions . Some Pentagon staffers suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force officer implied that the heavy losses of B-52s during the strikes had finally frightened him . " There 's some sympathy for that guy Heck , " the officer allowed . " He was flying into the hairiest area of the world . " But Heck himself said that fear had nothing to do with his decision . " If they tell me now to go on milk runs , the B-52 targets over South Viet Nam where nobody gets shot at , I would feel no different . I would even refuse a ground job of supervising the loading of bombs or refueling aircraft . I ca n't be a participant . " Why ? Because , he explained , " the goals do not justify the mass destruction and killing . " <P> As embarrassing as it may have been to the Air Force , Heck 's decision neither embarrassed nor surprised his family , who knew his feelings from his letters-and sympathized . Said his father , a real estate broker in Chula Vista , Calif. : " It was not a snap judgment . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Viet Nam , in fact-we had the feeling that he felt things there were not the way he expected them to be . And then when we had this mass bombing , before Christmas , it was just the last straw that triggered it . " <P> Heck 's decision could well place the Air Force in a difficult position . It may have to court-martial him , not something it relishes doing to a highly decorated pilot . Or it may accept his resignation or place him on conscientious objector status . But either course might encourage other pilots to follow suit . Heck 's case may also prove a puzzle to President Nixon . In addition to two presidential unit citations , Heck also holds a diploma from Nixon 's own alma mater , Whittier College . Last week Heck told TIME 's Peter Simms : " This is the first time in my life that I have been able to feel really happy and good , because I have made the right decision .
