Robbery , murder , lust and revenge in a bucolic setting <P> West of Philadelphia , Chester County is a rural paradise of well-tended farms , fox hunters galloping to hounds , and Amish families traveling by carriage to hamlets dating from colonial times . It is horse country-Thoroughbreds , trotters and steeplechasers-a quiet haven for the landed gentry . But in the back country along the Maryland and Delaware borders , Chester County is also home to a band of outlaws that has preyed for years on affluent neighbors . <P> The gang 's members have pulled off hundreds of robberies , stealing cash from store safes , jewelry , antiques and cars from country estates , and tractors from farmers . Federal and state investigators say they can directly tie the gang to more than $1 million in stolen loot but believe the total take is much higher . <P> The leader of the gang is politely spoken but hard-eyed Bruce Johnston , 39 , and his top lieutenants are his brothers David , 30 , and Norman , 28 . The three have all served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractors and trucks in Lancaster County . But generally the Johnstons and their dozen or so confederates have escaped convictions , despite dozens of arrests , several indictments and trials . One reason is sloppy police work : most cases against them collapsed because of technical errors or tainted evidence . Another is the closemouthed ways of the people in southern Chester County , who mistrust outsiders , especially police . Says Chester County District Attorney William Lamb : " When they have a problem , they prefer to settle it themselves . " <P> Neighbors call Bruce , David and Norman the " bad Johnston brothers " to differentiate them from three other brothers known as the " good Johnstons . " Says a Chadds Ford garage owner of the bad Johnstons : " We all know them-good-lookin ' boys , but they always had them $100 bills and them fancy cars even though they never was too healthy for work . " Says a family friend : " Bruce is a moral man who does n't hold with drinking and swearing . His word is his bond . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month a Johnston confederate , Leslie Dale , led the police to the body of an informer , Gary Wayne Crouch , in a shallow grave in dense woods near West Chester . A few weeks later , in the woods near Chadds Ford-a locale made famous by Artist Andrew Wyeth-state police unearthed the bodies of three gang associates : Wayne Sampson , 20 , Duane Lincoln , 17 , and James Johnston , 18 . The three had disappeared in August , along with Sampson 's brother James , 24 . <P> James Johnston was Bruce 's son , and he vanished soon after rumors began circulating that he , like his brother Bruce Jr. , 20 , known to the family as " Little Bruce , " had turned on his father . The boys had been raised by Grandmother Harriet Steffy and Great-Aunt Sarah Martin . " They did n't start hanging around with their father until a couple of years ago , " recalled the grandmother . " I prayed for them , but I guess they just liked having money in their pockets . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
