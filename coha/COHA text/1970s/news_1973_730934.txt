Gary Alexander , 2510 S. Homan Av. , was reported in good condition immediately after the operation . He is expected to be released from the hospital tomorrow . THE ATOMIC pacemaker. powered by a pellet of plutonium 238 , could last beyond the life expectancy of the patient , according to Dr. Thomas Baffes , director of surgery at the hospital .

When Alexander first went to the hospital , he had a heart rate of 30 to 40 beats per minute . The pacemaker , which can be set for a maximum of 72 beats per minute , will provide " demand stimulation " when the heart fails to beat .
