" When I was an assistant professor , " says Theoretical Physicist David Saxon , " I thought the role of a university administrator had nothing to do with anything . " Saxon , 55 , will soon have ample opportunity to find out if he was right . It has just been announced that in July he will take over as president of the nine-campus , 122,436-student University of California , a trend setter in U.S. higher education . <P> Saxon , vice chancellor of U.C.L.A. and provost of the entire university , will assume the top job at a crucial period . Once unquestionably one of the best universities in the nation , California has been buffeted by both the excesses of student demonstrators in the 1960s and the conservative fiscal policies of former Governor Ronald Reagan . Libraries and the physical plant have deteriorated , and the university 's vigorous growth has been brought to a halt . Berkeley has dropped its departments of criminology and demography ; U.C.L.A. has closed down its department of speech and graduate school of journalism . Although U.C. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation have clearly been tarnished . <P> Liberal Candidate . Whether Saxon is a strong enough leader-or will be permitted to have the power-to reinvigorate the university is an open question . Since last fall , when Charles Hitch announced his plans to retire , the regents ' search committee had culled a list of 260 names to find a new president . The choice finally narrowed down to Saxon , the candidate of the liberals and moderates , and Robben Fleming , president of the University of Michigan , who was backed by the conservatives . After several trips to California , Fleming withdrew from the running and the regents , with less than a solid vote of confidence , picked Saxon . On the final ballot 13 regents voted for Saxon , four abstained and six were absent . Saxon was chosen , says the regents ' chairman William French Smith , because , among other reasons , he knew how the system works : " You ca n't take too many risks when putting someone in charge of a billion-dollar-plus operating budget . " <P> Saxon came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing some research in that school 's radiation laboratory . He progressed through the ranks at U.C. , along the way collecting what he terms his most satisfying achievement : U.C.L.A. 's distinguished teaching award . He still likes to return to the classroom ; last year he found time to teach a freshman seminar in cosmology ( the study of the universe ) " just to prove to myself that I still knew enough physics to do it . " <P> Given to well-worn tweeds and a dry intellectual wit , Saxon relaxes by playing the recorder in a Baroque chamber group or sitting down with friends for an evening of poker . An avid gardener , he is getting ready to transplant his 30 carefully tended bonsai trees from Los Angeles to the magnificent hillside house north of Berkeley that-along with a $59,500 salary-goes with the president 's job .
