For the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , no subject has been too cosmic , no issue too complex . In the past 16 years , the center has boldly sought to " clarify the basic issues and widen the circle of discussion about them . " An offshoot of the Fund for the Republic , an organization dedicated to defending civil liberties , the center was organized by Robert Hutchins , iconoclastic former president of the University of Chicago . Amidst the seaside splendor of a 43-acre Mediterranean-style estate in Santa Barbara , Calif. , the center 's scholars pursued Hutchins ' formidable goal . An average of three mornings a week , the chimes of a Benedictine bell summoned them forth to a marble-floored edifice for " dialogues " on weighty issues-many of which eventually appeared in a lofty publication called The Center Magazine . <P> Last week , however , the dialogue was less reasoned and rational . In fact , there had been increasing acrimony in Santa Barbara , and everything was in a shambles . The center , nearly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president had resigned , the staff had been cut to the bone , and the center 's last major financial benefactor said that he would withdraw his support . <P> Ford Money . Much of the blame for the center 's current plight lies with Hutchins , who firmly believes in sparing no expense in the pursuit of knowledge . Despite initial backing of $4 million , supplied by the Ford Foundation from money originally granted to the Fund for the Republic , and subsequent bequests that totaled some $26 million , the center 's annual expenses often exceeded income-and unrestricted gifts were never put aside for endowment . Hutchins gave the up to 20 resident fellows-many of whom were often absent from the center-annual stipends of as much as $35,000 each , and visiting scholars were boarded in luxury at the Santa Barbara Biltmore . Says Senior Fellow Dr. Alex Comfort , author of The Joy of Sex , " Hutchins may have set out to study democratic institutions , but he ran this place like a Byzantine harem . " <P> Last June , Hutchins hired Malcolm Moos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as president in the hope that he could raise funds to restore the center to solvency . Hutchins , now 76 , ostensibly retired to a cottage on the estate as a salaried " life fellow , " but retained considerable behind-the-scenes clout . " I knew I 'd have to scramble , " says Moos , " but I had no idea the situation was so desperate . " In November he reduced the staff from 64 to 39 and pared his budget by 50% , to $1.2 million . In January , 24 more employees were let go , and Moos submitted an austerity budget of $500,000 . In the past four months , he managed to reduce the center 's deficit to $30,000 by raising more than $300,000 from foundations and private contributors . <P> But for Moos ' critics at the center , these efforts were not enough . Says Harry Ashmore , former editor in chief of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Hutchins ' chief operating officer : " When Moos was elected we were in no worse financial condition than we always had been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm Moos does n't have the prestige to maintain the dialogue .
