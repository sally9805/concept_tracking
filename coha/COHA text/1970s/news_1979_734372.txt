txt BL Ltd. , the last ' major British-owned automobile company , announced plans today to end production of the MG sports car , lay off 25,000 workers and close all or parts of 13 plants . The moves are part of a sweeping reorganization of the company , which has been in financial distress for most of the last decade . The British Government took control of BL , formerly the British Leyland Motor Company , in 1975 when it was on the brink of collapse . The reorganization is intended to improve BL 's operating efficiency , said Sir Michael Edwardes , chairman , who has been under pressure to improve the profitability of the heavily subsidized company . BL is Britain 's seventh-largest industrial concern and largest exporter . The company is an amalgamation of four other concerns : the British Motor Company , producer of the MG , Morris and Austin cars ; the Standard Triumph Motor Company , which makes Triumph cars ; Jaguar Motors Ltd. , producer of Jaguar cars , and the Rover Motor Company , maker of Rover automobiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the individual companies that make up BL were themselves the result of mergers . Over the years , the MG has probably been the best-known British automobile next to the Rolls-Royce . MG sports cars once were the most popular sports models sold in the United States , but in recent years imports from Japan and other countries have taken a much larger share of the American market . The slumping value of the dollar against the pound contributed to the car 's loss of popularity in the United States , according to industry analysts . The loss of the MG will leave the Triumph , also made by state-owned BL , as Britain 's only mass-produced sports car . Production of the 50-year-old MG line , built mainly for American buyers , will stop some time next year under the proposals announced today . The comBlocked due to copyright .

About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Midget models , come off the Oxfordshire assembly line each week . Seventy percent of the output , or 30,000 cars a year , is exported to the United States . Legions of Devoted Owners The car , which now sells for $5,800 to $8,000 in the United States , first gained popularity in California but by the 1960 's was widely distributed in the East and elsewhere . Early models , which brought sports car racing to America , won legions of devoted owners . It was particularly popular with the young , who sought an open , sporty car at an affordable price . The MG is a sports car that was not actually designed as one . Morris Motors , one of the many companies that over the years became British Leyland , now BL , built a car called the Bullnose Morris that one of its distributors began converting for sports purposes . The sports car that resulted was so successful that Morris subsequently bought the distributor , Morris Garages , whose initials became the car 's name . BL 's Triumph was also affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's current work force of 165,000 by at least an additional 25,000 members over the next two years . Some 18,000 jobs have been eliminated since January 1978 , when employment totaled 183,000 . The Triumph Dolomite and Spitfire models are to be dropped , though the TR 7 sports car , which has just introduced an open-top version in the United States , and the new TR 8 will continue . Government Meetings Planned The company 's reorganization proposals , which are expected to save BL $225 million annually , came in anticipation of meetings with the Government at which it will request additional money to finance new cars needed to plug holes in the middle range of its product line . Though Sir Michael said today 's plan did not reflect any Government pressure , it was widely believed that the prospect of meeting Conservative ministers forced the company to demonstrate the likelihood of greater efficiency . And although it was suggested that the slimming down of BL might be a prelude to returning the company , which has about 50 plants , to the private sector ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be no possibility of this in the foreseeable future . Sir Michael disclosed at a news conference that the company earned a modest $21 million in this year 's first six months , up from $18 million a year earlier , but said more plant closures and the acceleration of new models were necessary to prevent disaster . BL reported a loss equivalent to $72.3 million for all of 1978 following a deficit of $90.6 million in 1977 . In 1975 , the company lost $283.9 million and , in 1979 , it lost $56.3 million . The only profitable year in the last five was 1976 , when the company earned $61.2 million . Because of the need for continued Government subsidies to offset the losses , the Government stake in BL has risen gradually to 99 percent . When the company was nationalized in 1975 , the Government estimated that $6.7 billion in new capital would be needed to keep BL viable until 1982 . BL 's latest difficulties have come to light just as the Chrysler Corporation has asked for United States Government aid to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not meet on its own . Unlike Chrysler , BL 's troubles stem from a long history of labor strife , low productivity and outmoded production facilities . Its record of strikes and other disruption by its workers , for example , has become a national joke . And its share of the domestic automobile market has shriveled to 20 percent , with Japanese and other overseas producers with more attractive products and quicker delivery dominating . Sir Michael said today that the worsening outlook for BL reflected an energy-related drop in demand for motor vehicles , a fall in BL 's share of the domestic market and the sudden rise in the international value of the pound . ( As he spoke , British engineers had begun their second week of two-day strikes that Sir Michael estimated would cost the company $95 million . Strikes by truckers last winter cost it some $67.5 million , he added . ) " Our business has two fundamental weaknesses which make it more difficult to cope with this type of situation than would a normal , healthier company , " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized and well-publicized gaps in our model range . The second is that BL has too many facilities and fixed expenses in relation to volume now being projected . It is overstructured. "
