txt THE TRAFFIC cop saw it rumbling down the Dan Ryan Sunday morning in the rain . A yellow school bus with Indiana plates bound for the First Baptist Church of Hammond and jammed with children . Children standing in the aisle , children sitting triple on the seals , children sitting on other children . So many children , in fact , that the policeman said he could not even see in the bus windows . So , at 51st Street , he pulled the bus over . When he looked inside , he found 113 children stuffed into a bus with 20 seats . A total of 114 persons , including the driver -- Ronald Welsh , 30 , a seminary sttident with a Florida driver 's license  --  were in a bus built to carry - 10 passengers  --  at the most . SO , THE POLICEMAN took Welsh and the bus in . But when the bus reached Wentworth traffic headquarters , it was discovered that  --  overloaded or not  --  there was nothing the Chicago police could do . The bus was registered in Indiana . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois statutes on school bus safety were not specific enough to warrant an immediate charge against the driver . It was not the first time buses from the First Baptist Church of Hammond have been stopped by Chicago police for being overloaded . FIRST BAPTIST has the largest Sunday school in the country , and it brings in scores of buses loaded with children from all over Chicago . " Half the parents who put their children on these buses do n't know who isdriving or how many are going to be on it , " said one traffic policeman . " Some day there 's going to be an ac. cident , The bus could skid , roll over , and catch on fire . " How are you going to get 113 kids out of a burning bus ? I asked the an at the church how he would live with that . I asked him three times but he did n't answer me . " RDNALD WELSH was not held or itharged . But an information report will be handed over to the corporation counsel 's office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another bus was sent from Hammond to the police station . When it arrived , half the children from the overloaded bus boarded it . Then the two buses continued toward Hammond in the rain  --  only an hour late for Sunday school .
