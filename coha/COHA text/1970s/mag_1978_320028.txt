Medicine <P> Help for a paralyzed Yank <P> It was the second quarter of a football game between Texas Christian University and the University of Alabama . Already behind 14-0 , the underdog Texans gave the ball to their junior tailback , Kent Waldrep , 20 . Sweeping around the right end , he quickly ran into the Crimson Tide 's crushing defense . As two players tried to push him out of bounds on the Alabama 40-yd. line , a third crashed into his legs from behind . Waldrep was hit so hard he flipped over and landed headfirst . Texas went on to lose , 41-3 . But for Waldrep that game in 1974 was an even more devastating defeat . He was paralyzed from the neck down . <P> In the fall , Waldrep crushed his fifth vertebra and bruised the spinal cord . At Birmingham 's University Hospital , doctors were able to rebuild the damaged vertebra with a segment from his hip bone , and after intensive physical therapy Waldrep regained some use of his hands , arms and upper body . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a life sentence to the wheelchair , Waldrep began investigating an experimental and disputed Soviet treatment being used at Leningrad 's Polenov Neurosurgery Research Institute . Helped by the intervention of Texas Congressman Jim Wright , the House majority leader , and contributions of nearly $15,000 from a T.C.U. fund raiser and his home-town folks in Grand Prairie , Texas , Waldrep arrived in Leningrad last October . He was the second American sports figure among the nation 's estimated 200,000 spine-injured patients to make that pilgrimage this year . ( The other was Race-Car Driver Bob Hurt , who suffered spinal injuries in a crash at Indianapolis in 1968 . ) Last week , after six weeks of treatment , an ebullient Waldrep returned home to Texas with an increased sense of feeling in his legs and feet . More important , aided by braces , boots and a walker , he is able to stand and , he said , even " walk . " <P> Waldrep ascribed his improvement entirely to the Soviet doctors and therapists , whom he found much more compassionate than American physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear out of a doctor here even if you stuck an onion in his face . " As Waldrep described it , his Leningrad regimen involved strenuous physiotherapy ( weight lifting , massages , etc. ) , five-day-a-week sessions in a high-pressure oxygen chamber and , most controversial , daily muscle injections of a tissue-softening enzyme called hyaluronidase . The Soviet rationale for its use : it can prevent and break down scar tissue around damaged spines , thereby presumably encouraging regrowth of healthy nerve fibers and restoring at least some of the cord 's ability to transmit nerve signals .
