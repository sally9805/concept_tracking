ADAM RESURRECTED by Yoram Kaniuk , translated from the Hebrew by Seymour Simckes. 370 pages . Atheneum. $8.95 . <P> His name is Adam Stein , and he is a kind of W.C. Fields of the Jews . Once he was Europe 's greatest clown , and more than that , a clairvoyant who could tell the history of anybody in the audience from a piece of cloth held in his hand , read whole books through their covers , and even , just by looking into a man 's eyes , tell that he had quarreled with his wife the night before . Chatting about a movie , he would automatically register that the hero spoke 4,266 words of dialogue ( v. the heroine 's 2,437 ) . He was also a swindler , an alcoholic and-well , of course , periodically insane . <P> Adam , in short , possesses some of the manic gifts that used to be associated with divine madness . Like Dostoevsky 's Prince Myshkin , he sees only absolutes in a world of ostensible reason . Almost singlehanded , he gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli Author Yoram Kaniuk . <P> Voids and Pressures . A crazy house in the desert-dominated by enormous biblical presences , voids and the threat of war-is perhaps the only place where discussion of Hitlerism and the Jews can be conducted any longer ; the grim documentaries have become self-defeating by repetition , the outrage exhausted by its own weight . Appropriately , therefore , Adam Resurrected is centered on a flossy insane asylum near the Dead Sea . <P> Predictably , the source of Adam 's madness is the fact of his survival . He was spared the gas chamber at a German camp by Commandant Klein , " who did n't hate Jews any more than the average butcher hates his cows . " Adam agrees to calm and amuse the prisoners on their way to the gas chambers . Even when his wife and daughter pass through the line Adam giggles them on , bowing to Klein 's austere logic that it is better to spare them as much final pain as possible : " Nothing disturbed Commandant Klein as much as the dread that they might die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Adam act like a pet dog , making him crawl around his parlor on all fours and compete with his teeth for bones tossed to Klein 's dog Rex . <P> So much for temporal hell remembered . Stein 's present haven is an institute established by an eccentric Cleveland widow persuaded that God was conceived in the desert by prophets who were themselves psychotics . As a fanatic inmate explains : " We were a nation , a nation that betrayed its God . And we paid the highest price possible - we became smoke and ashes . " And all those who returned are , in Kaniuk 's idiosyncratically mordant view , insane . During the day they live well . They are allowed to work , make money , build houses , enjoy the illusion of progress . But at night they have nightmares and cry . " The insult scorches , " the author explains . The knowledge , the final realization that they were " simply raw material in the most advanced factory of Europe , under a sky inhabited by God in exile , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned this country into the largest insane asylum on earth .
