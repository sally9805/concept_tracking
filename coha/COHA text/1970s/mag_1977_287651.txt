The fate of two men Nixon said he had considered pardoning was decided instead by the Supreme Court last week . There would be no review , said the court , of the convictions of John Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman-or of former Attorney General John Mitchell . All three had been convicted on Jan. 1 , 1975 of a total of 14 felonies for their roles in the Watergate coverup , including obstruction of justice , conspiracy and perjury . They were sentenced to prison terms of from 30 months to eight years , with no possibility of parole for 2 years . <P> The Supreme Court 's decision meant that it could be only a matter of weeks before Haldeman and Mitchell go to jail . Ehrlichman has been convicted besides of conspiracy and perjury in the illegal plumbers ' operation , and began serving a 20-month to eight-year sentence on those charges last October , at Arizona 's Federal Prison Camp at Safford . Last week his Washington attorney said his client would not make further appeals on the new decision . Lawyers for Mitchell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearing ; only two such petitions have been granted of the last 700 or so to come before the court . <P> Big Debts . If the request for a rehearing comes to naught , Mitchell will be the first U.S. Attorney General ever to serve a prison term . A friend of his told TIME that Mitchell had gone on hoping for a presidential pardon until last November , when Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter . Mitchell has some investment income but is no longer allowed to practice law ( he once earned $250,000 annually as a municipal bond lawyer ) , and friends say he is burdened by enormous debts . <P> Haldeman , who lives quietly in Los Angeles , and has been seen lunching at Orange County 's plush Balboa Yacht Club , also has huge legal bills . After the court 's action last week , he called a press conference on his front lawn and said : " For the past three weeks I have been watching the Nixon-Frost interviews . I 've avoided comment because I had the hope they would clear up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . I feel now that I have to challenge President Nixon 's explanation of the cover-up and that it 's time to deal with many things that have been left unsaid . " Haldeman said he would publish a " gloves off , " " no holds barred " book on Watergate this fall . <P> Friends say Haldeman has been deeply concerned about Nixon 's " dumping on him " ; yet as the White House tapes revealed , he was closest of all to Nixon . At week 's end his publisher , Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. , announced that Haldeman " will tell who ordered the Watergate burglary " and will disclose the contents of the famous 18-minute gap in the White House tapes .
