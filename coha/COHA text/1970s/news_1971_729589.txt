txt The issuing of a visa to black congressman Charles C. Diggs Jr. , of Michigan , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Africa and outspoken critic of apartheid , is a clear sign of South Africa 's determination to patch up relations with the United States . The dramatic switch in policy comes after an application by Mr. Diggs in 1966 was flatly rejected and a visa granted only conditionally in 1969 . The strong line by South Africa over the 1969 Diggs application ? allowing him into the country only on condition he did not make any speeches ? erupted into a major diplomatic row . Prime Minister John Vorster said at the time that no country with any self-respect would permit American congressmen to come and " interfere in South African domestic , affairs . " A government source said that Mr. Diggs and several members committee would also be allowed to visit the disputed territory of West Africa .
