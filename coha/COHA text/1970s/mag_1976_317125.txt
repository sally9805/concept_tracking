" Once the dust has settled and the CIA is no longer Page One news , many members are likely to lose interest . Closed-door meetings do n't allow Congressmen to make speeches or issue press releases or titillate their constituents with inside stories . " So argues Democratic Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin . His cynical point is that a congressional committee to oversee CIA operations would be a washout in five years because its members would lose their enthusiasm as soon as the CIA was no longer a big story . <P> Aspin may be right , but last week the CIA was Page One news practically every day , thanks to a steady flow of leaks , apparently from members and staff of the House Intelligence Committee . The committee is scheduled to issue by next week a report on its six-month investigation of the CIA-but there may not be much left to reveal by then . Bits and pieces of the 340-page report were leaked to newsmen . <P> Among the disclosures : <P> &gt;In the late ' 50s , trying to sour Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA produced a film purporting to show him engaging in sexual relations with a woman in Moscow-and planned to pass off the movie as a KGB blackmail attempt . Before the film could be circulated in Indonesia , however , the CIA had second thoughts and canceled the dirty trick . <P> &gt;Though the Ford Administration valued at $32 million the military aid supplied by the CIA to anti-Soviet factions in Angola , the report charges that it was really worth much more . High Administration officials called the accusation a bum rap , insisting that .45-cal. pistols were valued as low as $5 apiece and .30-cal. semiautomatic carbines as low as $7.55 because they were World War II surplus , and have drastically depreciated . <P> &gt;Soon after U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Rodger P. Davies was assassinated in Nicosia in 1974 , U.S. intelligence officials reported the killers ' identity to high Cypriot officials , but the assassins are still serving in the Cypriot government security forces . Officials of both the CIA and the State Department denied the story , saying the U.S. does not know who killed Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting intelligence overseas while posing as journalists for U.S. and foreign news organizations . A somewhat similar disclosure was made by former ABC Correspondent Sam Jaffe , who has admitted that he reported regularly to the FBI while covering the United Nations in the late 1950s and Moscow in 1961-65 . He claimed to have been told that the CIA once drew up a list of 40 to 200 journalists who had cooperated with the agency . The claim was denied by the CIA , House and Senate investigators , and two prominent journalists named by Jaffe : Anchormen John Chancellor of NBC and Walter Cronkite of CBS . <P> A sizable section of the committee 's final report-also leaked-faults Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for overriding the objections of CIA and State Department experts to covert operations in Angola and Italy . Kissinger is further berated , to the extent of 80 or so pages , for trying to withhold secret information from the committee-in part because he feared it might be leaked .                 @ @ @ @
