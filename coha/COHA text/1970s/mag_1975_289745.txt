Archaeologists have long been intrigued by the heaps of brownish-gray slag scattered amid the sandy soil of Israel 's southern Negev Desert . First spotted by the late American biblical scholar and archaeologist Nelson Glueck , the heaps seemed to be remnants of an ancient copper-smelting operation of pre-Roman origin . Now , after excavating at the site with a team of West German mining experts , Israeli Archaeologist Beno Rothenberg reports that the slag is only the tip of an archaeological treasure . A short distance away , he says , is the oldest underground mining system ever found . <P> The traditional view is that the first really large-scale attempts at underground mining , in which extensive shafts and subterranean galleries were used , were not made until the time of the Romans , who mined everything from Spanish silver to British iron and Near Eastern copper . Rothenberg 's discovery just about destroys that theory . From the stone hammers , bronze chisels and a cooking pot found in the labyrinthian tunnels of the Negev mine , he concludes that the mine dates back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a millennium before Rome 's large-scale mining endeavors . <P> Underground Maze . Archaeologists once thought that Bronze Age people got their metals largely by chipping away at surface rocks ; at most , they would tunnel only a few dozen feet . The newly discovered mine shows that the Bronze Age miners were far more skilled and adventurous than that . Located at the base of towering , 2,200-ft. red sandstone cliffs , the mine contains a complex , multilevel network of some 200 shafts and galleries . Although only a small portion has been excavated so far by Rothenberg 's team , which included ten West German coal miners , the maze apparently reaches hundreds of yards into the mountain . Perhaps 1,000 workmen-or slaves-toiled inside the tunnels , most of which were no more than 2 ft. wide and 4 ft. high . The underground network included ventilation tubes and shafts to bring fresh air into the galleries , support pillars that prevented collapses and even steps and handholds for climbing from one level to another . <P> The ore taken from the mine was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone hammers and bronze chisels , crushed into small pieces and placed in large , saucer-shaped pits . When winter rain flooded the pits , the lighter malachite swirled to the surface and could be more readily separated from the other rock . Half a mile away there were 13 furnaces , where the Bronze Age metallurgists smelted the ore , using iron as a flux ( a substance that combines with impurities , forming a molten mix that can be easily removed ) . Bronze Age miners were able to produce 22-lb. copper ingots that were 97% to 98% pure , a degree of purity not exceeded until modern times .
