Unlike conventional auto races , in which cars careen around a paved track , off-road competition masses as many as eleven different classes of vehicles in a bone-jolting race against time across the desert . Subsidized by major auto companies and parts manufacturers , California championship races that three years ago appealed to barely 3,000 people now attract crowds of 45,000 , who stand along the dusty trails to watch . Last week TIME Correspondent David DeVoss rode two laps as co-driver in a newly inaugurated race , the Laughlin , Nev. , 300 . His report : <P> A padded helmet encases my head , and four thick safety belts intersect in a bulbous metal codpiece . As my two-ton Chevy Silverado truck edges toward the starting line , all I can feel is the plastic barf bag stuffed in the pocket of my flame-resistant jumpsuit . Behind the wheel sits Walker Evans , 36 , a general contractor from Riverside , Calif , who has won 14 of his past 17 off-road races . As the green flag rises , the final spectator salute of uplifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Walker wo n't stop if you get sick . " <P> The thwack of my helmet against the seat confirms Newton 's third law of motion . The air is piercingly fresh , and the desert mountains glow golden in the morning sun . But soon the drive will become a spastic , three-hour Cinerama focused on 100 miles of lifeless mesquite moonscape-beginning in Laughlin and running across sand washes , over mountains , around canyons and back . " Howdy doody ! " Evans yells , skipping the yellow truck over a 5-ft. ravine . " I ca n't stay away . Racing off-road is like narcotics to a dope addict . " <P> And just as expensive . The mature males who drive open-cockpit racers , production vehicles and jerry-rigged " Baja bugs " at insane speeds over camel-backed " whoopdedoos " spend a minimum of $10,000 on their rigs . The cash prizes for most races are about $2,000 . In Laughlin , a rest-stop community of 100 residents and three casinos tucked away in Nevada 's desolate southern tip , the car with the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000 spectators are a largely blue-collar crowd from small Southwestern towns . Dressed in DIESEL POWER T shirts and Peterbilt trailer-truck caps , they revel in the dust and noise . For some , off-road racing is an egalitarian country gathering . " My husband is a mechanic and I 'm just a small-town housewife , " says Loretta Pipkin from El Centre , Calif . " But out here everyone is equal . " <P> With the spectators behind us , Walker skirts a dozen disabled vehicles before hitting a rugged series of parallel flash-flood ravines . Beyond the windshield , the horizon pitches erratically . Suddenly a blue two-seater racer materializes inside the amber cloud of dust enveloping us . Like a mechanical mantis , it springs from gully to boulder until Evans grows impatient and swerves to bump it aside . Evans laughs : " From here on out I 'm running my own race .
