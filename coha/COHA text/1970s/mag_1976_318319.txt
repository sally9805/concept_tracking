LADY ORACLE <P> by MARGARET ATWOOD <P> 345 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $8.95 . <P> Alice in Wonderland is alive and well and living in Margaret Atwood 's new novel . She has changed a bit : she operates under the alias Joan Foster , resides in Toronto and writes gothic romances on the sly . But she still has more identities than she knows how to handle , takes pills that make her undergo disconcerting changes of size , and gets into trouble by gazing too long into a looking glass . <P> Most of the time , Joan Foster is the quietly unremarkable wife of a humorless student radical . In odd stolen hours , she plays mistress to an avant-garde artist who serves as a kind of latter-day Mad Hatter . From both husband and lover , Joan cleverly hides two secret shames : the fact that she produces feverishly romantic gothic novels and her pre-diet-pill memories of a miserably obese childhood . Both are telltale signs of a temperament too florid to suit the doctrinaire , modernist tastes of the men now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of automatic writing while staring at herself in a three-way mirror , she turns out a surreal prose poem called Lady Oracle that becomes a bestseller . Sudden celebrity as the author of Lady Oracle - which publishers promote as an irresistible blend of Rod McKuen and Kahlil Gibran-brings a blackmailer into Joan 's life . Rather than face exposure of her multiple lives , Joan plans a fake accidental death by drowning . Thereafter , she hopes to resurface in a new life - one that will be " neat and simple , understated , even a little severe , like a Quaker church or a basic black dress with a single strand of pearls . " <P> The escape works for a while and she gets to Italy , but her life stubbornly continues " to spread , to get flabby , to scroll and festoon like the frame of a baroque mirror . " Significantly , the same might be said of Margaret Atwood 's writing in Lady Oracle . The novel does not develop ; it meanders , circling around and turning in on itself - letting its contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Italicized chunks of Joan Foster 's latest gothic romance pop up just when one is expecting the next chapter in her life . The reader is kept off balance by jagged shifts from the comfortable ordinariness of situation comedy to the casual cruelty of slapstick farce to the gripping panic of surreal nightmare . <P> Crooked Seams . After writing Lady Oracle , Margaret Atwood , like Joan , may have wondered whether she " should have taken it to a psychiatrist instead of a publisher . " Fortunately , she did not . For if Atwood 's last novel , Surfacing , was her basic black dress of a novel - trim , taut and meticulously crafted - then Lady Oracle is successful motley , a striking work made out of bright patches with all the crooked seams showing .
