First we have a roll of a snare drum offscene . This is repeated and continues as an offscene trumpet gives its long and announcing dynamic call . The call is repeated also . Next we have an overture lasting some two and one-half minutes , played by an offscene brass ensemble or powerful military band . This over-ture is derived from James Hewitt 's " Battle of Trenton " music . At the proper place the sound of a distant great gun is heard . The overture music now goes down and under and continues as another great gun is heard and then another , all mixing and turmoiling together . In the turmoil the cruel crackle and spatter of rifle fire are heard . Then as the volume of sound sinks down a bit , yells and shouts and cheers come through nearer at hand . This should be staged in such a way as to give the audience the feel of a great battle actually taking place in its hearing . VOICES Yorktown ! Yorktown ! OTHER VOICES Cornwallis surrenders !

( The turmoil of sound , which has softened down somewhat as the voices come through , is now resumed . It builds and builds till the whole amphitheatre is filled with it . Now woven in and penetrating through it come a few phrases of the Maryland state song , passing into a specially rendered section of our national anthem and ending fortissimo . A soldier in the uniform of a Maryland militia man appears at the rear of the center stage , crossing from right to left to the sounding of this interpretation of the national anthem . He carries a large Stars and Stripes on a long flagstaff held aloft . The music and the battle sounds fade down and out as the flagbearer disappears . After a few heartbeats of silence , the snare drum resumes its beating off at the left front . The offscene brass ensemble or organ begins playing the old 18th century melody " Columbia .

Following next are the citizens of Annapolis  --  common people , discharged soldiers , merchants , lawyers , political leaders and a few satin and lace aristocrats . A number of them carry little national and Maryland flags . They are all singing and waving their flags as they enter. ) p. 3 PEOPLE Columbia , Columbia , to glory arise , The queen of the earth and the child of the skies.Thy genius commands thee , with rapture behold , While ages on ages thy splendor unfold .

He is acting somewhat like a musical director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leading the song with his clear tenor voice . There are a few other Old Line Soldiers in the crowd , and some of them are much disabled  --  one on crutches , another with a peg leg , and a blinded one helped along by a comrade . ) Thy reign is the last and the noblest of time , Most fruitful thy soil , most inviting thy clime.Let the crimes of the east ne'er &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encrimson thy name , Be freedom and science and virtue thy fame . ( A few forlorn people appear at the far right and look on . These , as we learn later , are dispossessed Tories who have been allowed to remain in Maryland and keep the peace . Several young men come along in the procession , pulling an open wagon .

Hurrah ! ( After a few heartbeats of silence , a loud handbell is heard at the left front , then the voice of the town crier . ) TOWN CRIER Attention , people of Annapolis ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! ( The crier , comes in at the left front . He is a rather long , cadaverous fellow of middle age and wears the 18th century dress of a tradesman . He carries a bell in one hand and a staff in the other . He is accompanied by a Maryland militiaman announcer who wears a sword at his waist and holds a scroll .

( The offscene theatre music begins playing a Washington march , and the spotlight dies away from the crier and announcer and picks out a few of the congressmen as they cross the scene at the rear from right to left , disappearing into the shadows . The Announcer identifies some of them . ) ( Gesturing . ) General Thomas Mifflin , from Pennsylvania , President of the Continental Congress .

General Washington ! ( This is a brief eye-blink scene , and the light moves from it to come in as a sort of shaft reaching across the sidestage . The bells continue ringing in the town , and now many of the young people of the preceding procession come running in from the right and tear out along the left area . ) YOUNG PEOPLE ( Excited as they run . ) : He 's come !

The church bells stop ringing , the shaft of light fades out , and the light comes up on the center stage. ) p. 8 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene 2 The old senate chamber in the Maryland statehouse . The congress has assembled and is seated . We see only some eight or ten of the members as the rest fade off into the shadows . The highlight is on Mifflin and his chair and the table close by . All members of the congress are wearing hats and do not remove them till later . The secretary of the assembly is standing near a door at the right rear . SECRETARY ( In an announcing voice . ) : General George Washington awaits the pleasure of the honorable congress . MIFFLIN Let him enter ! ( Washington with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform of commander-in-chief of the American military forces . His coat is of deep blue , faced with yellow buff , and with large plain gilt buttons . His waist-coat and breeches are of the same kind of buff cloth as the facings . He wears white stockings and silver-buckled shoes . His aide , David Humphreys , a young man of thirty or so , in the uniform of lieutenant of militia , stops and stands a pace or two behind him . The secretary now speaks loudly and clearly to the General . ) SECRETARY The United States in congress assembled are prepared to receive your communication . ( Washington bows to the congress . He puts on his glasses and unfolds the prepared statement he carries in his hand . The members of the congress sit straight in their chairs , their hats firmly on their heads . In no wise will they , the great civil authority , acknowledge superiority , or even equality , of the military with them. ) p. 9 WASHINGTON ( Reading evenly and frankly . ) : Mr. President , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , I have now the honor of offering my sincere congratulations to congress , and of presenting myself before them to surrender into their hands the trust committed to me and to claim the indulgence of retiring from the service of my country . The successful termination of the war has verified the most sanguine expectations and the assistance I have received from my countrymen increases with every review of the momentous contest . Having now finished the work assigned me , I retire from the theatre of action , and bidding an affectionate farewell to this august body under whose orders I have so long acted , I here offer my commission and take my leave of all the employments of public life . ( He draws his commission from his pocket , turns , bows and hands it and the copy of his address to President Mifflin who takes them and lays them aside on the table . Washington lifts off his glasses . ) MIFFLIN ( Still wearing his hat . ) : Sir , the United States in congress assembled receive with emotions too affecting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have led their troops with success through a perilous and doubtful war ( With emphasis . ) The glory of your virtues will not terminate with your military command , it will continue to animate remotest ages . We commend the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God . ( Almost fervently . ) And for you we address to Him our warmest prayers  --  that a life so beloved may be fostered with all His care , and that your days may be happy as they have been illustrious . ( The members of congress now uncover as if on a signal but do not rise . Washington bows once more and with his aide retires the way he came . Far away a great gun booms and is silent . The scene fades out . In the darkness theatre music plays the dignified old hymn " Chester " through once and stops . After two or three heartbeats of silence male voices are heard over at the right sidestage area in a tight almost barbershop harmony . The light comes up there. ) p. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around Mann 's City Hotel in Annapolis a few hours later . The light at first reveals only the space somewhat to one side of the hotel 's front . Here Henry Bailey and a small group of his army singing buddies are gathered . Two of the men , John Turner and David Shaw , carry lanterns to light them along . Stephen Price stomping on his peg leg has his bass voice in good shape . So do Joseph Purdy and Gordon Pennell with their first and second tenors . Bailey gives them a whiff of trying-out . BAILEY ( Conducting and singing . ) : ' T is Washington 's health , fill a bumper &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; around , For he is our glory and pride  --  ALL Our arms shall in battle with conquest &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; be crowned , Whilst virtue and he 's on our side . ( With a sweep of his hand Bailey cuts off the song . ) BAILEY I 'll call you at the proper time . ( He gestures , and the group moves back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-stage area , the light coming on ahead of him . We see a sort of reception room in which are a few chairs , a table , etc . A door is at the left rear , leading to an inner room . For the moment this setting is pretty much in shadow , but there is light enough for us to discern a young woman walking up and down reading a book . Bailey comes nearer the room and pantomimes knocking on a door or drawing on a bell-pull . The proper sound responds . The young woman lays aside her book and comes forward , the light brightening now and revealing her more clearly . She is a rather attractive young lady of some nineteen or twenty and her dress shows she is in mourning . Her heavy auburn hair is done up in the style of the times . Her name is Lucy Moreland. ) p. 12 LUCY ( Queryingly . ) : Yes , sir ?

BAILEY ( A bit testily . ) : And you are guarding the door ? LUCY ( With her quiet smile . ) : Billy Lee asked me to guard it while he 's off to the market . BAILEY Billy Lee  --  he is still with the General ? LUCY Of course , and ever faithful . Do you know Billy ? BAILEY Wait till I see him . My name is Henry Bailey , ma'am , captain as was in the Maryland Old Line . I served in the war under the General  --  LUCY My name is Lucy Moreland . I live with the Washingtons . ( Thoughtfully . ) I have heard your name  --  somewhere I have , sir  --  I believe so  --  BAILEY Perhaps General Washington mentioned it . At Germantown  --  LUCY Yes , perhaps so .

BAILEY I 'm sorry . LUCY ( Twisting her hands together . ) : It was the last battle  --  Yorktown  --  Peter was with Colonel Alexander Hamilton , leading his men up the redoubt . ( Her voice almost breaking . ) General Washington read the service over him . ( She turns away , then turns back in control of herself , her voice a little hard . ) I fear you can not see the General . ( She stands looking out at him and he looking in and up at her . ) BAILEY Perhaps I might call on him at Mt . Vernon ? LUCY Perhaps . BAILEY ( Somewhat boldly . ) : Shall I  --  shall I see you there ? LUCY ( Shaking her head and speaking determinedly . ) : Since Peter was killed I do not receive callers anymore . BAILEY ( As is his impetuous way . ) : But Yorktown happened more than two years ago , ma'am . p. 14 LUCY ( Indicating her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This black shows my feelings , Mr. Bailey . BAILEY ( Again a little boldly . ) : It is very becoming to you . ( She glances out at him , seats herself in the rocker and resumes her reading . A great bass voice raised in song is heard approaching at the right front . Bailey turns . He knows that voice . The light dims down in the room and brightens at the front . He stands with folded arms , waiting . Billy Lee comes walking stolidly in . He is more mulatto than black and carries a large heavy splint basket by the over-hung handle , the weight sagging his right shoulder down a bit . He is rather stout and is in his late fifties . His hair showing below his big dark hat is peppered with gray . ) BILLY Oh , it 's aye belay , below , And a-crabbing we will go  --  Where the waters of the Chesapeake reach around  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fill a belly , fill a bowl , Good for body , good for soul  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks off and stops near Bailey . ) I see you are a Maryland man , and I pay my respects unto you , sir .

No , no , he says , ' taint none of it worth a continental , he says . And soldier script , I wo n't take that , he says . Gim me good money , he says , some of this or some of that  --  ( Reciting half-singingly in his great voice. )  --  a half bit or pistareen , Johannes or doubloon  --  Pistole or ducat  --  A French sous or half-pence  --  ( More loudly . ) A guinea or moidore  --  ( With a shout . ) Or else a Spanish dollar !

Well , sir , I told the pirate that these crabs were for General Washington to take to Mt . Vernon , and he says no charge , take ' em and get out .

BILLY ( Instinctively with his roaring voice . ) : And indeed , sir , ' t is true , sir , I never was given to lie .

BILLY And I 'm goan take more care of him now . Yes , sir . I 'll put these crabs away . ( He reaches for the basket . Bailey takes hold of the handle with him , and they move along . Billy goes off alone around at the left front . Bailey turns back into the scene . The light brightens in the room and fades a bit at the front . ) LUCY You and Billy Lee are like old friends , Mr. Bailey .

BAILEY Yes . No matter , ma'am , that 's all past . And I 'm good as new now . ( Voices are heard beyond the door at the rear of the room . ) LUCY The conference is ended , Captain Bailey . Good night , sir . p. 17 BAILEY Good night , Miss Lucy Moreland . ( Calling as she disappears in the shadows at the right rear . ) At Mt . Vernon , then , I will see you ? ( She makes no answer . Washington 's voice is heard beyond the door . ) WASHINGTON Yours is the responsibility now , gentlemen . VOICES We have to agree . ( Bailey hurries over to the right front and gestures . His buddies hurry in . The light widens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton and McHenry com out of the rear room into the center room .

Bailey signals his welcome . The bass is now doubled . Washington is pleased with the serenade , and the men with him signify their approbation in their looks and nods . ) ' T is Washington health our hero to bless , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May heaven look graciously down.Oh , long may he live our hearts to possess , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And freedom still call him her own  --  Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And freedom still call him her own-Still call him her own .

MCHENRY It was the only way to excise the infection and make sure the cure . And you made no murmur or complaint . p. 20 WASHINGTON ( Now as if including the men in his statement . ) : When the situation demands it , we must endure .

I 've served him more'n twenty-five years  --  and I 'm hoping for twenty-five more . I 've tended him in sickness , put poultices on him when he hurt , cleaned his sword , made his bed and emptied his chamber pot every morning year after year  --  since the early Ohio days and right on up to now . He 's offered me my freedom , but I do n't want it . I want to stick close to him . That 's my love for him , I reckon . Yes , folks , you can call it that .

He stops and speaks in a business-like and narrating voice . ) And so it was that come cockcrow in the morning we set out for Mt . Vernon and got there for Christmas night . And what a Christmas !  --  All the overseers from the General 's different plantations gathered with their families and the slaves whooping and hollering and slobbering with joy !

She turns and hands the baby to Billy . She and Ephraim now strut their stuff . Billy is upset . He hands the baby to Lucy and makes for Chloe . He jerks her back and stands ready to fight Ephraim. ) p. 27 BILLY I reckon that 's enough , gal ! ( He turns to Ephraim . ) Scat , you Tom Cat ! ( The people laugh . At a gesture from Washington Jones takes charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loudly . ) : Now to our barbecue  --  and good ' simmon beer ! VOICES Some cider too ! ALEC SR . Yeh , yeh , sweet cider . ( Grunts at this . Washington and Martha lead the way off . All start thier chant again , pots and pans banging for emphasis . ) PEOPLE Happy days done come back to Mt . Vernon . Happy days , etc . ( They all go off at the right front and right center . The scene fades out and the music reprises the Baby Jesus melody and dies . After a moment of silence , Billy reappears at the right front in a tight spotlight . ) BILLY Well , me and the General went to it and in time got things running purty good at Mt . Vernon . But people , people , all the time people  --  coming and going and stopping and staying the night , all to meet the great General George Washington and a lot of ' em wanting him to help ' em . Them Indians from Ohio 's been here three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their land back . They 're barking up the wrong tree . The General hisself owns a bit of that land  --  40,000 acres of it , they say , along the Ohio River , signed , sealed and made manifest  --  in the Williamsburg Courthouse  --  and they need n't try to get that back . Yea , we 've kept to our farming and , as the General says , dwelling under our own vine and fig tree , as best we can . And always the General is busy projecking about new tools and ways and means  --  trying to get a better new-ground plow or get mud from the bottom of the river for fertilizer , or fixing himself a harrow or seed sower . ( He gestures with extended hand , shrugs and retires . The light fades from him . The sound of hammering and knocking is heard in the right sidestage area . The light comes up there. ) p. 28 p. 29 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 A corner of the barnyard at Mt . Vernon . The angle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it is a strip of white picket fence . Washington with his sleeves rolled up is working at a road-cart-and-barrel contraption in the foreground . With him are his overseer Alec Jones and Alec Jr. , a boy of some ten or twelve . Uncle Caesar is standing to the right leaning on his heavy stick and gazing out with blinking eyes at his master 's working . Now and then as the scene goes on we hear the distant singing of slave field-hands  --  a heavy wind-wash of half-discordant harmony . Washington hammers away and tries to fit the chain from a sprocket at the end of the barrel to the sprocket hub of the wheel . WASHINGTON Let 's see , Alec . ( Alec and his son lift the shafts of the cart and try to pull it . The barrel does n't turn . Washington shows his irritation . ) Tchk  --  tchk ! ( He consults his drawing ) When the barrel turns , the seeds will come evenly from the little holes we 've bored in the barrel  --  a good grain distributor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sowing by hand and making a mess of it . ( Uncle Caesar gives a sort of cackling laugh. ) p. 30 WASHINGTON ( A bit harshly . ) : And what 's so funny to you , Uncle Caesar ? UNCLE CAESAR De Good Book say de old way is de best way . WASHINGTON ( Shaking his head and talking half to himself . ) : I need Ben Franklin or Tom Jefferson here . They 'd solve my problem . ALEC SR . Lord , General Washington , you 've got more sense than any man in America . Everybody knows that . UNCLE CAESAR Ai n't it the truth ! WASHINGTON Jefferson made himself a plough that turns the turf over to rot . A great invention . And there 's . Franklin  --  and  --  ( He studies his drawing . ) ALEC SR . And you done made yourself a good new-ground plough  --  tears up the roots same as a jumping coulter , yes sir . ALEC JR .

" WASHINGTON ( Gruffly as he looks around and down at the boy . ) : And Mr. Franklin drew lightning down out of the sky with a kite , did n't he ? p. 31 ALEC JR . Yes , sir . UNCLE CAESAR Help my life ! WASHINGTON ( To Alec Jr . ) : How old are you ? ALEC JR . Ten , sir . UNCLE CAESAR Better not mess with the heavenly power in the sky . That 's God 's work . ALEC SR . ( Solemnly . ) : The truth ! ( Washington mops his forehead . ) WASHINGTON Aih , we work and labor in blindness , Alec . Our hands are weak . We need tools , machinery , power to do the job in this great land . Ah  --  The generation ahead of us  --  they will succeed where we fail . Like old Scipio , we labor here for those that come after us . In the young people must be our hope . ALEC JR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ) WASHINGTON Go ahead , boy , this is a free country now . ALEC JR . About the seed distributor here  --  could n't you let the axle turn  --  the wheels turn too ? WASHINGTON ( Looking at him . ) : And ?  --  ALEC JR . Let the bottom sprocket be fastened to the axle and not on the hub outside ? p. 32 ALEC SR . You know , General , that 's the way he had us  --  my older boy George and me  --  build his little playwagon . It pulls mighty easy . WASHINGTON ( Studying the situation . ) : Hmn  --  hmn  --  ALEC SR . Little Alec here has got a head full of sense , if I his daddy say it who should n't . He 's named after me and can read like a house afire . WASHINGTON And you other boy is named George  --  after me  --  and he 's not so smart . ALEC SR . Oh , now I would n't say that . He 's mighty smart at trapping minks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn much from the woods also . So Alec Jr . can already read and write . ALEC SR . Go ' way , sir . My wife Annabelle teaches him best she can . He 's done read the Bible through once . And memorize  --  hmn  --  First thing off he ups and learns that speech Patrick Henry delivered on liberty a few years back . ALEC JR . ( Stiffening suddenly and calling through the air . ) : " I know not what course others may take , but as for me give me liberty or give me death ! " ( Washington gives some applause of an ironic sort , by tapping floodingly on the barrel with his hammer. ) p. 33 WASHINGTON And if you 'd been old enough , young Alec , you might have got that death instead of your liberty  --  like so many other young men  --  in the war . ( Turning and staring at him . ) But still there was no other way for us but war . You understand ? ALEC JR . Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one life to give for his country . WASHINGTON Yes . A brave and noble young man . ALEC JR . And John Andre said before he died that he called on all to witness he died a brave man . Mama cried when she heard you had hanged him . ALEC SR . Alec ! ALEC JR . General Washington had n't ought to have done that , she said . WASHINGTON ( Loudly , almost angrily . ) : I had to hang him  --  he was a spy ! A spy ! My army was going to pieces . I could n't lay hands on Benedict Arnold . ALEC JR . Yes sir , a spy . ( Washington is silent an instant , gazing down at young Alec with some sort of appraisement . ) WASHINGTON Yes , the younger generation  --  let the old make way for them . ( Earnestly . ) You must study , learn , read in the great books  --  get the best teachers . p. 34 ALEC SR . ( Eagerly . ) : Annabelle wanted me to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you give money to . If young Alec could go there  --  sir  --  WASHINGTON We 'll talk about it , yes  --  later . I 'll see what I can do . ( He stares at the barrel and the hub of the wheel , then studies the axle . ) It might work . ( Billy Lee comes in at the left front . ) BILLY They 's some gentlemen from Maryland to see you , sir . General Smallwood from across the river , Mr. Luther Martin from Annapolis and  --  WASHINGTON Make them comfortable and I will see them later . BILLY And then they 's another gentleman you ca n't make comfortable  --  Captain Henry Bailey . WASHINGTON Bailey ! He bombards me with letters and now comes in person . BILLY Yes , sir . Shall I tell Captain Bailey you 're working on your road cyart  --  and ca n't be bothered ? WASHINGTON No . ( To Alec Sr. ) Take the cart around to the shop , Alec . I 'll come when I can . Tell the blacksmith we 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Alec 's hair with his great hand , smiles and turns away . Little Alec grins with delight and puts his hand on his hair where Washington had touched it . Alec Sr. gets between the shafts , little Alec pushing . Billy gives the cart a push too and it is pulled away at the right front . Uncle Caesar waddles along after it . Billy watches them off . For an instant the singing of the slaves in the distant fields comes in in blurred words . Billy lets loose for a bit with his organ voice. ) p. 35 BILLY AND SLAVES Dey 's a mansion in de skies  --  Lay muh burden down  --  From de grave de daid do rise  --  Lay muh burden down .

The theatre music , a violin , begins interpreting her feelings .

He shakes hands with them . WASHINGTON I am very glad to see you , Mr. Martin MARTIN And you , sir . ( Martin is a dark wiry man of middle age . ) WASHINGTON ( To Smallwood . ) : And , William , it 's always a pleasure to welcome a Marylander from across the river . SMALLWOOD ( Gazing about him . ) : And how many autumn and winter mornings have we drunk a toast in this very room to a successful hunt ! Mr. Henry Bailey  --  General Washington . WASHINGTON ( Nodding . ) : Captain Bailey and I are old acquaintances . BAILEY ( Bowing . ) : Greetings , sir . MARTIN Bailey is now a junior partner in my law office and a new member of the Maryland Legislature . He will go far . WASHINGTON My felicitations . ( Turning to Smallwood . ) I have just received some new millet seed from Jefferson in Paris , William . I 'll share them with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gentlemen  --  Is Jefferson making us a good ambassador to France ? SMALLWOOD No man could fill Mr. Franklin 's shoes . BAILEY ( Strongly . ) : Thomas Jefferson can . WASHINGTON ( Abruptly . ) : He writes much of the spirit of liberty spreading in that country , inspired by our example , he says . ( With sudden buoyancy . ) The whole world is looking on our experiment here with high hopes . BAILEY And the picture the world sees here at this hour is not encouraging , sir . You have received my letters ? WASHINGTON Yes , and I have been remiss , Captain . Your pardon . ( He gestures . ) Be seated , sirs . ( With the exception of Bailey they all sit . He remains standing . ) MARTIN General Washington , we bring greetings from His Excellency , the Governor of Maryland , His Honor the Mayor of Annapolis and members of the governing council , sir . ( Washington nods . ) WASHINGTON My grateful acknowledgment and respects to them , sir . p. 41 MARTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the year . WASHINGTON He writes his intent to do so . SMALLWOOD Excellent . MARTIN Therefore we extend to you and him at this early date  --  the hospitality of Annapolis and its citizens for a visit . WASHINGTON I would guess ' t would be his pleasure to accept . Certainly it is mine . Your theatre will be playing then ? BAILEY Yes , sir . We will stage something especially for you . WASHINGTON Play " She Stoops to Conquer . " That 's my favorite . BAILEY Well , something , sir . WASHINGTON And the races ? MARTIN Yes , they are being resumed . WASHINGTON The last time I bet on a horse race in Annapolis was before the war . I lost a pound and six . SMALLWOOD Naturally the times being what they are , the sponsors  --  and I 'm one of them  --  are apprehensive as to the financial outcome of the races . WASHINGTON I 've often noticed that when people are worried , they drink more , smoke more , er  --  make more love  --  seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them forget . They 'll come to the races and risk what money they have . Do n't doubt it . p. 42 BAILEY Then , sir , you agree our people are worried ? WASHINGTON ( Gazing at him somewhat straightly . ) : Of course . MARTIN That is the main subject this appointed committee has come to talk about , General Washington  --  the condition of the country and what can be done . ( He gestures to Bailey . ) BAILEY As you know , sir , the unrest of the people throughout the United States is increasing . ( He waits . Washington waits . ) WASHINGTON ( After a moment . ) : Yes . BAILEY Congress is doing nothing in Philadelphia and the people want action . ( He waits . ) WASHINGTON ( After waiting . ) : What kind of action ? BAILEY Action that will bring some sort of stability to the country . WASHINGTON Yes . BAILEY The people are walking the streets of Annapolis and Baltimore hungry . WASHINGTON I understand there are plenty of fish in the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait can be found under bottom fence rails . Let some of them go fishing . p. 43 BAILEY ( A bit roughly . ) : This is no joking matter , General Washington . WASHINGTON ( A little sharply . ) : I 'm glad you set me to rights , Captain Bailey . Sometimes , when I realize it , my ignorance appalls me . BAILEY ( Gulping . ) : Daily the value of our paper money is declining , markets are drying up . Taxes ca n't be collected . Foreclosures and forced sales are doubling  --  trebling . ( Solemnly and strongly . ) And more and more solid and honest citizens , unable to pay their taxes or legal debts , are being hauled off to prison , there to rot behind bars . I believe , sir , this country is headed toward anarchy , mayhap civil war . WASHINGTON ( Suddenly , loudly . ) : No ! MARTIN What will stop it , General Washington ? WASHINGTON When the people suffer enough , a change will come , they 'll make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? It may all be for the worse . On my farm I raise apples along with sheep , tobacco and corn . In times past I was able to ship barrels of apples to Baltimore for a good price , also wool , some down to Annapolis too , to Alexandria . Now I let the apples rot  --  under the trees  --  what I do n't use for cider or the women for jellies . And wool  --  it 's  --  ( Gesturing. )  --  nothing . And tobacco  --  well , there 's still a small edge of profit in it as you know . But with the market falling day after day , in a few weeks we 'll have to limit our planting to home use . Something has to be done , and we 've come to you . p. 44 WASHINGTON So have other delegations of recent days , gentlemen  --  from Richmond , Baltimore , Williamsburg , Norfolk . And others will come  --  all saying what you are saying , asking what you are asking . BAILEY And your reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that men too often are willing to let misfortune come upon them rather than tighten their belts and prepare for its coming ahead of time . Warn them , warn them all you will , and they will not heed . Like the children of men in Noah 's time , they will not listen . BAILEY ( Quickly . ) : And what happened , sir ? Those that did not listen to Noah were lost . The flood came . And a flood of destruction is coming over this land , sir . ( Vehemently . ) It is ! It is ! WASHINGTON And I am not Noah , and I can not build an ark . BAILEY You do not believe me , sir . ( Washington rises . He turns about the room . Bailey sits down . ) WASHINGTON I have written letters and will write more . BAILEY But letters wo n't do it . You must act , sir . WASHINGTON ( Stopping and touching his thigh . ) : Here on my thigh I once had a carbuncle . Dr. McHenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bad . Then can you cut it out , Doctor ? I ca n't operate now , he said . Why not doctor ? Because it 's not ready , it 's got to ripen more and come to a head . Then I can lance it , get the rot out , clean it , put some sweetgum and tar in it , bandage it  --  and it will heal . The situation in this country , gentlemen , is not ripe enough for the operation . p. 45 BAILEY ( A little sourly . ) : When will it be ripe enough , sir ? WASHINGTON I do n't know . BAILEY And you dare risk it . WASHINGTON What else can we do ? BAILEY Not we , sir , but you . What can you do ? What will you do ? WASHINGTON Continue farming here at Mt . Vernon . ( Bailey throws out his hands in exasperation . ) BAILEY So it 's true what the papers say , what the people say . The one man to whom this country would listen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lead . ( Springing to his feet . ) My God , sir , I would not have believed it ! ( Fiercely . ) I followed you in the war , trusted you , and so did thousands , so did this country . We knew you 'd never quit , and so we stuck there , true to you . Yes , true . Now when all that we fought for is about to be lost , you refuse to budge from the comforts of your home . Well , go ahead , sir , stay here , plant your trees , listen to Lucy Moreland play the harpsichord  --  WASHINGTON ( Roughly. ) :  --  The pianoforte . She helps me on my letters and accounts also . Are you sure you have not been drinking , Captain Bailey ? p. 46 BAILEY ( With something of a shout . ) : Lord God , no ! ( He drops down in his chair . ) SMALLWOOD ( Sternly . ) : You 've said enough , Mr. Bailey . BAILEY I 've just started . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't act , sir , I will . I 'll go up and down the state calling on the people to resist the tax officers , to march to Philadelphia and stand face to face with congress  --  I 'll  --  WASHINGTON You will not ! ( With a yell . ) Sit down , Captain Bailey ! ( Bailey sinks slowly down in his chair . Washington now goes on more quietly . ) You may remember that before I retired from the army I sent a letter to all the governors of the thirteen states , asking , yes , pleading with them that they and their legislatures keep uppermost in mind the welfare of the country as a whole . Again and again I have urged this in my correspondence . You know that is true . VOICES Yes , General Washington  --  true . WASHINGTON When we were fighting a common military enemy , we stuck together . Somehow under the Articles of Confederation , we stuck together , though each state by terms of the Articles kept its sovereignty  --  had its own flag , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common habits and doings . Now that the outside enemy is defeated , the force that held us together is removed and selfish interests are taking over . ( Turning about and grinding his hands suddenly together . ) Freedom is becoming license , and the men of freedom are betraying the cause for which their sons and brothers died . Traitors ! Traitors ! ( He stops and stares off. ) p. 47 BAILEY That 's it , sir , what you 're saying . Go to Congress , stand up before the members , say that , ask them in God 's name to wake up . This country must have a new Constitution  --  one with teeth , with power in it  --  a solid government of strength of authority  --  an indissoluble union of the states under one federal head  --  or the states will fight among themselves . Yes , sir ! WASHINGTON So England is hoping , and Spain . Then they 'll gobble us up . One year ago there in Annapolis the treaty of peace was signed and  --  MARTIN There 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Southern states  --  and form a little tight nation of their own . Would you head an army , sir , to put that down if it happened ? WASHINGTON It must never happen . BAILEY But if  --  WASHINGTON ( With a shout again . ) : Do n't poke these ifs at me ! ( Controlling himself . ) You are my guest . Captain Bailey , you will pardon me . ( He goes on more quietly . ) I have hoped since the day I resigned my commission in the statehouse there in Annapolis two years ago that the ship of state would right itself . I have not yet given up hope . I still believe in the people  --  not to the extent that Jefferson does , but more than my dear friend Alexander Hamilton does . I have believed that if nothing else would hold the states together , a common interest in trade would . They have to trade one with the other . And so I have been working for a canal system of communication and transportation between the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side  --  by way of the Potomac and James Rivers . p. 48 SMALLWOOD A great plan . I 'll buy stock in it now . WASHINGTON I do not know what will be involved to make the river falls navigable , but I do know that we must have ways and means of carrying on trade from one part of the country to the other . BAILEY But that is just what 's not happening  --  trade between the states is breaking down . New York has set up taxation against New Jersey and Connecticut . Goods from those states can not enter New York without paying duty . WASHINGTON Blind , blind . I have written Governor Clinton begging him to rescind that perverse and selfish statute . If he agrees , that will set a pattern  --  If not  --  ( With a touch of finality . ) I thank you gentlemen for coming . BAILEY ( Sharply . ) : But the carbuncle must ripen further , sir ? ( The men have all risen . They shake Washington 's hand . ) WASHINGTON ( Coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wait for the ripening , the infection may go so deep that no operation can work and the patient may die . Is it not possible , sir ? WASHINGTON I trust not . I have taken a vow to stay out of public life , henceforth , and I intend to keep that promise . ( Strongly . ) This is a democracy  --  the people must speak , must act . Let there come a movement north and south , east and west  --  the people ! the people !  --  and they will find their own salvation , will earn it as they find it . Thus they grow strong . ( He bows . ) Good evening , gentlemen . I thank you for coming . p. 49 VOICES Good evening , sir . ( They go . Washington stands a moment , then sinks down in his chair . Martha comes in .

Wise heads must act  --  must  --  MARTHA ( Angrily . ) : And always they 're begging you to lead them . I have your promise .

MARTHA Like a certain other one in his youth , my dear . WASHINGTON I was never a firebrand in that way , Martha . MARTHA When you made love to me there at Williamsburg you were  --  er  --  not a firebrand  --  er  --  but a furnace . ( She laughs and hugs him to her .

WASHINGTON The blood of youth never stays too long a-cold , Martha . MARTHA You should know , George . Now just one letter and no more . Remember we 're to ride to Dogue 's Run plantation early in the morning to look after the new lambs . ( She kisses his cheek . He lifts his goose-quill pen , dips it and stares off again .

The forefront of the scene only is lighted , disclosing a speaker 's stand with a flagbearer on either side of the stand , holding flags outward . The flag on the right is a large New York state flag , and the one on the left a smaller Stars and Stripes . Illuminated in the front of the stand is the figure of Governor George Clinton . He is about forty-five or more years of age and vehement and choleric . He holds Washington 's letter in his hand from which he reads now and then and above which his voice pours out his reactions . CLINTON ( In his great booming voice . ) : But now the war is long over . And as governor of this sovereign state of New York and sworn protector of her rights and liberties , I must act as seems best to me . VOICES ( From the shadows . ) : Hear , hear ! Governor Clinton ! CLINTON Long continuance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear our once incorruptible Washington has suffered an attack of this insidious disease and can not let his military spirit rest and stay easy . He must still be poking his nose into civil matters . ( Back in the shadow one of the assembly springs up .

( In the shadows a great unseen gavel bangs . ) VOICE ( Above the gavel . ) : Mr. Alexander Hamilton , you are out of order ! ( Hamilton turns around as if he would call on some of his unseen associates to back him up against the truculent governor , then sits down . The spot on him dies . Clinton continues , his voice rising in stronger determination , and the light making its emphasis on him . ) CLINTON Gentlemen , I have sworn an oath to uphold , defend and protect  --  yea , to serve with all my heart  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( The bearer swerves the New York flag through the air . ) CLINTON My loyalty to it comes first , last and all the time ! ( He salutes the flag . ) VOICES It does , it does ! CLINTON And this flag is the flag of a free and sovereign state . It would be fatal to have any other loyalty , and as I am loyal to New York , serve it , keep it strong , let the governors of the other separate states do likewise with their commonwealths . And as each stays strong , all will stay strong , the United States will stay strong . True , for the moment there are troubles and disorders , but these will pass . A nation of liberty and free men will triumph over them . ( Applause , and once more the New York flag is lifted high .

" ( Alexander Hamilton , the light on him , stands up and applauds . The gavel bangs , he sits down , and the spot fades . ) And I would say the same , sirs , of him who would by whatever specious argument and pretext  --  ( He taps the paper meaningfully. )  --  would seek to overturn the structure of this , our native state of New York . p. 58 VOICES ( In loud fervency . ) : Amen , Governor !

( From the shadows a mumble of voices , but no words yet of agreement with the lone bold voice , but certainly some consideration of it . Clinton looks along the paper , then turns over a sheet . ) CLINTON ( Reading . ) : " I now make it my earnest prayer that Divine Providence would have you and the great state over which you preside in his keeping and would incline the hearts of all our citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to the government . " ( Waving the paper back and forth . ) Mark it , people , mark it , my fellow citizens  --  mark the word subordination , obedience to the government  --  and by government he means the present congress  --  the congress sitting and quarreling in helpless confusion in Philadelphia this very day , for it is the government .

HAMILTON Only this , sir . I ask you  --  again  --  how in the name of mercy are we to have a nation  --  if each state counts itself a separate sovereignty , a separate little nation ? Are we to be thirteen little nations  --  or one nation ? VOICES ( In a chant as the New York flag is waved . ) : Out of order ! Out of order ! ( And now Hamilton in his youthful zeal springs forward , seizes the Stars and Stripes and waves it . ) HAMILTON This is our flag  --  the flag of one united people ! Long live the United States !

Behind him comes a choir boy with a rude white cross lifted high and behind him a minister in clerical garments . The pale cold figure of Liberty Miss Hallam is carried along on a litter by two men . Beside her bier walks a man with a torch . The people in the play move aside , remove their hats and begin to hum the melody , falling in behind the procession as it moves along and around .

The music changes into a dynamic dance piece , and Liberty dances her joy of resurrection and love of freedom . She seizes the torch and runs among the people , sticking it at them and firing them into a brief dance of rebellion , Bailey gesturing her along . The dance grows in power and fury until the people , including the minister , are following her about the scene in a rout of fervor . Guided by Bailey , she leads them pell-mell out at the right rear . The bearers take up the bier and follow after .

RANDOLPH ( Conversationally somewhat . ) : I hear the cry of monarchy , of dictator . I remind you that most of the states have one man as their chief executive . For example , the illustrious delegate Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like office for the nation ? VOICES But Franklin 's power is strictly limited by the Pennsylvania legislature . RANDOLPH So will that of the national chief executive be limited by the congress . Mr. President , allow me to comment that our detailed document bears on this matter heavily . The chief executive of the nation will find that his political appointments and actions must be confirmed by congress . In fact the congress will have power , in our plan , to remove the chief executive from office . In case of high crimes and misdemeanors he can be impeached . And afterward he would be liable to trial by a jury for his crime like any common citizen . ( Tapping the document and turning to Washington . ) Mr. President , I was instructed by our delegation to present the general outline of our plan .

He sets the baskets down and mops his face with a white cloth about the size of a small towel . He looks out at the audience . ) BILLY Days have gone by . More delegates have come , and from what we hear there 's plenty of arguefying and old timey quarreling been going on in old Independence Hall . And hot  --  whew !

Well , them delegates better be getting something settled soon instead of talk . Times are worse all over the country . Take the food stuff in these here baskets  --  costs ' bout a third more now than when we come here six weeks ago . ( He reaches to pick up the baskets . Bailey comes stepping along .

I met him on the street , and he invited me . ( Billy picks up the baskets . ) What 's that ? BILLY Fish  --  some vegetables , taking ' em to Mr. Robert Morris ' house where we stay . The General has me do it  --  all on the sly though . For all his mansion and show , Mr. Morris is having money trouble . Bill collectors after him . BAILEY So I hear . That 's another great man , Billy . He kept the Revolutionary War going with the funds he raised  --  a lot of it out of his own pocket . Maybe General Washington will come to his aid . BILLY ( Lifting one of the baskets for emphasis . ) : Nunh-unh  --  not the General . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business  --  ( With one of his chuckles. )  --  less'n he 's out to borrow some money . BAILEY And if we stay here long enough , we may see Robert Morris a prisoner , like the others , cleaning the streets of the very city he 's helped to build . ( The distant chimes ring. ) p. 104 BILLY ( Gesturing . ) : The General 's got to sit there and listen to them Convention tongues for seven hours . BAILEY Yes , the thirty-eighth sitting . BILLY And the toothache hurting him again . BAILEY It takes time , time , Billy , for such a mighty document . Every point must be tested and proved , and the result will be the stronger , the more lasting . Once more the world will remember the General 's sacrifices . BILLY And I 'm beginning to believe them sacrifices are all for nothing . Them politicians will never agree . BAILEY You 've got to encourage the General , Billy  --  encourage him . Listen here  --  ( He has pulled a newspaper from his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ) In the Massachusetts Sentinel  --  " Ye men of America , banish from your bosoms all suspicions and distrust . Remember you have Washington the incorruptible at the head of the convention . His devotion to the welfare of the people is such that he would give every farthing of his vast holdings and wear pauper 's rags to his grave if he thereby could promote the public welfare . He will not yield up the victory . Behold our leader ! Support him how as he supported us all through seven long years of weary war . Answer , men of America . " ( He puts the paper away. ) p. 105 BILLY Yeh  --  right ! Right ! BAILEY And we will answer ! ( They go their separate ways . The scene fades out , and the gavel is heard in the darkness . The light comes up on the center stage again. ) p. 106 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene 3 Interior of Independence Hall , same as before . The long sessions are taking their toll of the delegates . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them are in shirt-sleeves and are using palm leaf fans to cool their necks and faces . Washington is sitting straight and patient in his presiding chair . The tapping of his gavel stops . WASHINGTON The chair recognizes the delegate from Connecticut , Mr. Roger Sherman . ( Sherman comes forward . He is in his sixties , tall , lean , sharp-faced and of plain dress . ) SHERMAN During these weeks we have traveled many ranging paths of discussion . And our subject matter , though mainly one  --  how to provide good government  --  has splintered into various facets and propositions and resolutions . But gradually we have come to a consideration of two plans , mainly , what is known as the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan . ( He consults a sheet of paper in his hand . ) The Virginia Plan contends for two branches of the national congress , the New Jersey Plan proposes a single body of congress . Virginia insists that the legislative powers derive from the people - New Jersey declares it must come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , " the latter , " we the states . " Virginia insists on a single executive for the country . New Jersey urges an executive body of three , fearing a grab for power if one man is the chief . Virginia contends unyieldingly that laws passed by the national congress take precedence over all contrary state laws . Jersey contends for limited cases only . ( Gazing about him . ) I am simply trying to refresh your weary minds , gentlemen , on some details . My main point comes later . Virginia contends that the chief executive can be impeached by the congress . Jersey says only by the state legislatures voting in three-fourths majority for such impeachment . In short , gentlemen , to repeat , Virginia proposes the establishment of a new and national government . Jersey , in the terms of our election directive , proposes that the Articles of Confederation be so revised , corrected and enlarged as to render the federal constitution adequate to the needs of government and the preservation of the union of states . ( Folding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  the Jersey Plan sustains the sovereignty of the states . The Virginia Plan destroys it . p. 107 VOICES ( In a sudden uproar . ) : Down with the Virginia plan ! ( Washington taps with his gavel . The scene quietens . ) SHERMAN ( With emphasis . ) : I believe the virtues of both plans may be brought together , gentlemen ! A VOICE Right ! SHERMAN But nowhere in either plan , gentlemen , is there provision for just representation of small states with large states in the national congress . A VOICE Representation on the basis of population is right and just . SHERMAN Mr. Madison says  --  ( He bows slightly to Madison who with a small wave of his small hand acknowledges the gesture and goes on writing. )  --  and I fear a majority agree with him  --  that big states such as Virginia and Pennsylvania should have more representation . A VOICE They have more responsibility , they pay more taxes . SHERMAN The Virginia Plan is backed by the most illustrious names in this convention , save one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make it right . It is wrong to deny to the small states an equal voice with the large . ( Strong dissent here . The gavel sounds again . ) I do not mean that in all ways and all particulars the voices are equal . It is the prevailing mood of this convention , I know , to forego the Articles and provide an entirely new document . But one provision we should keep . In the Articles each state was equal to any other and had an equal vote . p. 108 VOICES Hear , hear ! SHERMAN May I be personal . Would you gentlemen say that because our great Mr. Madison is much smaller than our great presiding officer , Mr. Washington , he is less entitled to an equal vote in this convention . ( Laughter . ) I am a plain Connecticut farmer , and I speak plainly . ( Strongly . ) I propose , gentlemen , that in the lower house of congress the representation be according to population  --  for every thirty thousand people one congressman - and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small , have equal representation . Thus quality and quantity are respected . ( A delegate stands . ) WASHINGTON ( To Sherman . ) : Does the delegate from Connecticut yield ? SHERMAN ( Staring over at Martin . ) : Yes , sir  --  but for a single statement only . WASHINGTON The delegate from Maryland , Mr. Luther Martin , is recognized . ( Some movement of tiresomeness by a few delegates . They 've heard Martin 's long harangues before . ) MARTIN I repeat what I 've said before  --  the great State of Maryland will never yield or sacrifice her sovereign , free and independent rights to any national and power-hungry central government . In my noble commonwealth the right of religious freedom was born and , sirs , there the spirit of liberty and individual  --  ( He is about to get off with one of his orations but a stern gavel hushes him up . He sits down , mopping his face the while . Sherman continues. ) p. 109 SHERMAN Connecticut proposes that each state be represented in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provision of good behavior . ( Murmurs of consideration . Another delegate rises . Sherman sits down . ) WASHINGTON The chair recognizes the delegate from New York , Mr. Alexander Hamilton . ( Hamilton steps forward . Now that we see him more clearly than before , he shows to be a handsome man of thirty or so , somewhat below medium height , and with a warm , rich voice . His cheeks are pink as a girl 's and he wears his chestnut hair brushed back . The delegates are immediately respectful in their attitude . ) HAMILTON ( Touching a paper in his hand . ) : I have here the sketch of a plan which I prefer to the two plans under consideration . As you gentlemen know , I have long despaired of the efficacy of democratic government  --  the rule of the people . Yet I must bow to the consensus of this convention , and what I offer is democratic  --  ( Some light appreciation of this. )  --  with some difference , and it may be considered as an amendment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way he says it means they are his , single and alone . ) I would like to see a single chief executive  --  chosen for life and with the power of absolute veto . ( He waits  --  no reaction . ) The lower house of congress should be elected by the people for a term of three years . Here resides the power of the people . State governors should be appointed by the national congress . ( Again he waits  --  but again silence . ) The United States Senators should be chosen for life . Thus the senate and the executive would be a balance against the democratic lower house . Such a government would derive  --  ( He emphasizes the word. )  --  from the people , but the rage for liberty and the excesses thereof would be held in check and obedience and responsibility find their proper place . Men love power . Give all power to the people and they will oppress the few . Give all power to the few and they will oppress the many . The purpose of government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not curbed , spread into violence and terror like wildfire and crime runs rampant . And why should we fear a chief executive chosen for life more than one chosen for seven years . The advantage of an executive for life is that he would be above temptation to corruption . Finally , gentlemen , I believe with all my heart that only a national government completely sovereign over every state and every citizen can establish America 's power at home and American prestige abroad . ( He sits down . Still all is silence and respect , whatever the disagreement. ) p. 110 WASHINGTON The delegate from Pennsylvania , Mr. Wilson  --  ( James Wilson has risen . ) WILSON I ask a simple question  --  Why should the idea of a national government be so unpopular with so many of our delegates ? Has it less dignity ? Will each citizen enjoy less liberty and protection under it ? Will a citizen of the small state of Delaware be degraded by also becoming a citizen of the larger United States ? VOICES Hear , hear ! ( Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate from Virginia  --  Mr. Madison . MADISON As a citizen of the vast state of Virginia whose territory stretches to the Great Lakes  --  I assure you I will be proud to be a citizen also of the great United States . ( Some applause . ) The honorable delegate from New York is held in such esteem by this body that his bold proposal for amendments to the Virginia Plan were received with respectful silence . I will not be silent . They are enough to turn my hair gray . ( The delegates are too tired and hot to give much applause , but they give a little . ) I request an opportunity to make my rebuttal later . The heat here is overpowering . I move we adjourn. p. 111 VOICE Second the motion . WASHINGTON The fifty-second meeting of the convention stands adjourned . ( The delegates move away . Two scrubwomen come along in front of the scene with mop and bucket . They go up into the hall and start tidying . ) FIRST WOMAN You ever learned what these folks are up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man says they 're trying to figger out ways and laws to make themselves richer and keep the poor folks poor .

After a moment a shrill flute-like rendition of " Yankee Doodle " is heard coming from the darkness of the right sidestage area .

A number of odd contraptions are about the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune of " Yankee Doodle " on his prideful musical glasses invention . Bailey is standing with a tea cup in his hand looking on .

( He stretches his gouty foot out on a hassock . ) In time these musical glasses will supplant the harpsichord and the pianoforte . I have no doubt of it . ( Bailey nods . Franklin indicates more tea . Bailey shakes his head and sets his cup aside . Franklin pantomimes pouring himself a second cup . ) Doctor Rush says an over-indulgence in tea is bad for my gout . But I lack willpower , Mr. Bailey . BAILEY ( Laughing . ) : I doubt that , sir . ( Indicating a contraption nearby as Franklin shrugs . ) And this , sir ? FRANKLIN A clothes mangle . Before long my shop will be turning out five of them a week  --  a great saving of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with long arms and cup-like hands. ) p. 113 BAILEY And this , sir ? FRANKLIN A perpetual motion machine . A poor young man worked at it till his mind gave way . He left it here . He 's in the asylum . There is no such phenomenon as perpetual motion  --  not even in the heavens . Wear and tear are everywhere . ( Glancing about him . ) The Deity himself ca n't prevent it any more than he can make two equal to four . ( He hands Bailey a drawing . ) One of the great things for the future of this country  --  a steamboat , John Fitch 's . He 's built it on the Delaware River and will test it soon . The paddles are moved by steam rather than human muscle . BAILEY It will work ? FRANKLIN He has been here several times . We discussed putting the paddles on wheels . BAILEY Would that you could live a thousand years , Mr. Franklin . You would give this country the inventions , the tools , the machinery it needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hints now . My powers are feeble . Those that come after me  --  young men like you  --  will do the job . In time steam will serve you and your children , then the greatest power of all  --  ( He stares off . ) BAILEY Yes , sir ? p. 114 FRANKLIN Electricity  --  the dynamics of future ages . And men will learn how to use it . And , sir , I trust they will use it well . BAILEY ( Jubilantly . ) : And we  --  they will ! FRANKLIN In the meantime it is given to us older ones to provide a guide of government by which they  --  you  --  can live in peace and plenty . You wished to talk to me about the convention , Mr. Bailey . BAILEY I do , sir , and you allow me great honor in this meeting . ( Franklin waves his hand . ) FRANKLIN You know I am not allowed to discuss what goes on in Independence Hall . BAILEY But , sir , the country now is questioning the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we 're going to finish the job . We 're nearing the end . Yes , sir . The document will not be perfect , but it will be the best that frail and contrary man can devise . BAILEY I believe it  --  for certainly , sir , with you and General Washington at the head  --  FRANKLIN Washington and I are going over the hill  --  men like young James Madison and Alexander Hamilton will have to carry on the fight . p. 115 BAILEY And there will be a fight over ratification , I fear . FRANKLIN Undoubtedly , and a bitter one , too . BAILEY It is about that I 've come for advice , Mr. Franklin . ( Franklin looks at him over his spectacles . ) I 'm a lawyer , a member now of the Maryland Legislature , a partner of the Honorable Luther Martin . FRANKLIN Ah  --  a powerful but wrong-headed man . BAILEY He has left the convention . FRANKLIN And well he has . His long-winded speeches were wearing everybody to a frazzle . BAILEY And gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals to the death . FRANKLIN ( Shaking his head . ) : Blind , blind . He maintains that if the chief executive is also the head of the army and navy , a dictator will result . He forgets the authority our new constitution will give to congress which alone will have power to declare war . The executive will always be held accountable to congress and his actions subject to review by the supreme court . That is , if we put this constitution through the convention . ( Chuckling . ) There  --  I 'm about to let the cat out of the bag . Forget my words . p. 116 BAILEY Mr. Franklin , when it comes to the question of ratification , I want to do all I can to win Maryland for it . FRANKLIN Maryland , because of her position , is a key state . BAILEY Yes , sir . And Mr. Martin is powerful . FRANKLIN And you are a member of his law firm . BAILEY Yes , sir . FRANKLIN And you will likely be kicked out if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Chuckling . ) : Excellent . It is such situations , sir , that bring out the best in a man . The chastening rod makes the child 's skin tough . BAILEY How best can I help in Maryland ? FRANKLIN Use your tongue  --  day in and day out . Write for the papers , get up parades , demonstrations , banners , slogans  --  ( Quotingly . ) " In union there is strength . "  --  " A united America is a strong America . " Cry , " We the people . " BAILEY The independence and sovereignty of the states must be given up , I agree , but  --  FRANKLIN No  --  not always . In federal matters , yes , but in local and state matters the states have their own supremacy . Do n't forget that  --  speak for that . p. 117 BAILEY But the rumor is that individual liberties may be threatened in what the convention finally approves . FRANKLIN Both Randolph and Mason felt so and returned home . But they were wrong . The people 's freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial are implicit throughout the document . Habeas corpus is included . Ah  --  hush my mouth ! BAILEY I have a letter from Mr. Jefferson in Paris . ( He takes it out of his pocket and hands it to Franklin . ) I wrote begging his advice and requesting his thinking . FRANKLIN Yours must have been eloquent for it receives a full response . ( Studying the letter through his double glasses . ) Hmn  --  hmn  --  he urges you and other citizens to make known your thinking by letters and appeals to the convention members . ( Reading . ) " I would recommend that voting in national elections as in others be by persons and not by states . I would hope that a bill of rights providing for freedom of religion , freedom of the press and assembly , and trial by jury will be incorporated . A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth . " ( Handing the letter back . ) Jefferson and his radical thinking ! Liberty , liberty , always liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The convention , Mr. Bailey , is cognizant of this and other matters . He bombards us too . p. 118 BAILEY Your own constitution of Pennsylvania has a bill of rights . FRANKLIN True . And so do the constitutions of six other states , including Virginia . BAILEY Then Mr. Mason 's leaving the convention must mean that this is being omitted here . FRANKLIN You may draw your own conclusions . But , sir , the new constitution will  --  would in no way repeal the state declaration in this particular . And I can assure you that no delegate is or ever will be against such popular rights . They are  --  will be  --  identical in the  --  to the sense of our  --  findings . ( He shifts himself on the stool . ) When you see the finished document , Mr. Bailey , I trust you will with all your might advocate its acceptance by Maryland . What changes prove necessary from time to time , let the people see that amendments are made , and they will . They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his cane . ) BAILEY ( Humbly . ) : Yes , sir . I shall do all I can ! ( Franklin gets back on his stool . ) FRANKLIN The people  --  the people ! Unlike any other government this one will depend on the sound common sense of the citizenry  --  upon their character , their knowledge  --  their purpose . p. 119 BAILEY And if the leaders are corrupt  --  FRANKLIN They will only be corrupt if they come from a corrupt people . I agree with Jefferson on this . BAILEY You are a great and wise man , sir , but I believe you and Mr. Jefferson are wrong here . ( Franklin turns and looks at him . ) Corruption can begin apart from the people and in the very power of the office held and because of that power . So I believe . ( Franklin chuckles . ) FRANKLIN So it is a man 's character in the final analysis that counts most ? BAILEY Yes , sir . FRANKLIN Then the business of government is to build citizens of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so  --  yes , sir  --  give the people the right sort of education  --  and  --  FRANKLIN We agree . When I need a good lawyer , Mr. Bailey , I 'll call on you . Do n't worry if Luther Martin dismisses you . Your future is bright . BAILEY ( Jubilantly . ) : Thank you , sir  --  I  --  ( Franklin holds out his hand . Bailey takes it eagerly . They shake . Bailey bends and kisses the hand. ) p. 120 FRANKLIN Good luck , Mr. Bailey . BAILEY ( Moved almost to tears . ) : Good luck  --  and bless you ! ( He hurries away . Franklin resumes playing " Yankee Doodle " on his musical glasses . The scene fades out . The music continues a bit , then segues into the long sounding of the distant chimes . This finally segues into the sound of the gavel . This in turn gives way to a sound of men cheering . ) VOICES ' Ray ! ' Ray !

The states ai n't ratifying that Constitution the way he hoped , and once more we hear of fights and troubles , people ganging up against one another  --  some for the new government and some against it . Nearly a year done gone by and only a few states have said yes . Take Virginia , no sir . Patrick Henry 's got it stopped . ( Stepping nearer the audience , glancing about him . ) Let me tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of Mr. Patrick Henry than they do of General Washington . They do what you call admire and honor the General , but they love Mr. Patrick . And he is going up and down the state preaching against the Constitution .

Far away we hear a voice high and soaring . It comes nearer . The figure of Patrick Henry stands illumined far upstage on a high platform . He is in the grip of his own eloquence. ) p. 125 HENRY I have the highest veneration for the gentlemen who formed the new Constitution , but , sir , give me leave to demand what right had they to try to annul , wipe out , destroy the power , the place and pride of the separate states .

" Nay , they had in mind a national government , one and supreme , a consolidated power which submerges the states , which shames them into subserviency and ineffectiveness . Sir , I love Virginia  --  ( Applause here from the unseen audience. )  --  I consider myself as the servant of this Commonwealth , as a sentinel over her rights , liberties and happiness .

( Bailey gazes at him , somewhat admiringly , his brow wrinkled a bit . ) And always the rich earth waiting to be stirred to its bountiful giving . ( Shaking his head . ) Most of my life , I have been a slave , Henry Bailey , a slave ! p. 129 BAILEY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a slave , sir , then may God have mercy on us poor creatures who whine in freedom  --  you the striding overseer over us . WASHINGTON But with no whip , sir . BAILEY No whip . And I feel no great sympathy for your serfdom  --  you the mighty triumphant Washington whose name sounds throughout the world . You are a mountain peak , a beacon for us to guide by , if you will . The pride of the republic . WASHINGTON What republic ? BAILEY A good question  --  what republic . You would not need to ask that if you would step forth and  --  WASHINGTON ( Loudly . ) : Say not a slave then  --  but a shuttlecock , and that 's worse . The first keeps at least a bit of will-power and his own humanity  --  a shuttlecock none . Yes , that 's me , beaten this way and that . And the bat that beats me is this everlasting duty  --  duty  --  duty that issues its summons , its commands . ( Bailey blinks , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reading from the scriptures last night where it said that when a man has done that which is commanded of him , he can say I have only done what it was my duty to do . Duty ! It is not a name I love , but I must obey it . ( Touching his breast . ) In here it says I must . p. 130 BAILEY ( Persisting . ) : Then duty summons you again to use your great name to help save the Constitution . WASHINGTON Not another word , not one . Good day , sir ! ( He starts out . Martha and Lucy come in with a tray . ) MARTHA No , no , my dear , not till you 've had your tea . ( He turns back and sits down . Martha laughs . Bailey is attentive to Lucy . ) Is it going to rain ? WASHINGTON ( Abstractedly . ) : The new wheat needs it . MARTHA From the cloudy looks of certain faces , I 'd say we 've already had a shower . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her as he takes it . ) BAILEY I thank you . ( She is solemn . ) The General and I were having a discussion . MARTHA Yes ? BAILEY On duty and pleasure . MARTHA The General has always been on the side of duty . LUCY Yes , but , Aunt Martha , pleasure too . Think how much Uncle George loves fox hunting and the theatre and  --  BAILEY But not the theatre any more . p. 131 WASHINGTON Oh , yes , when something good is playing . ( Rising . ) Now I must meet with my overseer . ( He goes . ) MARTHA Excuse me , Lucy  --  Captain Bailey . ( She follows Washington . Lucy starts to follow . Bailey steps in front of her . ) BAILEY Please , Lucy  --  you 've hardly spoken to me since I got here . LUCY I 've had no chance . You made straight to the General . ( A little hotly . ) Again you show your bad manners . Why do n't you leave him alone ! BAILEY At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your face  --  sweet , beautiful . Now today that sprinkle of temper showing in your eyes makes you  --  hmn  --  hmn  --  irresistible . ( He moves toward her . ) LUCY ( Putting out her hand . ) : I have not encouraged your address , sir . BAILEY Lucy Moreland  --  I love you . ( She turns away quickly . He stamps the floor . ) Since that first day I saw you in Annapolis at Mann 's Hotel  --  so alone  --  so lovely  --  no other woman has meant anything to me . ( She looks at him straight . ) Oh , I 've been in love before  --  not really love  --  I called it love . The girl who tended me at Germantown when I was wounded there  --  patient , kind , devoted to me she was . p. 132 LUCY ( A little jeeringly . ) : Ah , yes , yes , devoted ! Women are clever . BAILEY ( A bit jeeringly too . ) : With the softest hands . LUCY I 'm not interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's you , you , I love , Lucy , and my love is the stronger , the more  --  er  --  appreciative  --  LUCY ( Mockingly . ) : Appreciative  --  BAILEY  --  Appreciative of you because of the past . LUCY ( Somewhat hotly . ) : It 's not good manners  --  it 's vulgar to tell me of that past  --  of the women you 've  --  er  --  kissed  --  and  --  BAILEY Good Lord , I 'm trying to make you see  --  see I love you . I 'd be ashamed if I had n't responded to that girl . She 's married now  --  a husband and two children . I wager she 's loved her husband , made a better wife because of me.  --  ( Wagging his finger at her . ) Yes , a better companion in bed  --  ( Lucy shocked , puts her fingers in her ears and starts from the room . Once more he steps in front of her. )  --  because of me . ( He pulls her hands down . She tries to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I have nothing to offer you now , Lucy , but my love . I 'm poor as Job 's turkey and without a client to my name , and I 've got to give every ounce of my strength to try to save the Constitution in Maryland . But , Lucy ,  --  someday before long  --  wait for me  --  I 'll  --  ( She jerks her hand away suddenly ) p. 133 LUCY You are quite bold to say such words to me  --  after that girl  --  BAILEY ( Angrily . ) : All right , all right ! And I suppose the attraction Mr. Lewis Merriweather has for you is his lily white virtue , plus his great wealth . I doubt he ever kissed a girl . LUCY Oh , yes , he has . BAILEY Well  --  LUCY He kissed me . ( She trips from the room . Bailey stands staring ahead of him . ) BAILEY ( Fiercely . ) : The dirty scoundrel !

Miss Lucy when she passed me was crying . BAILEY Oh , Lord ! Billy , you 're looking at the biggest fool on earth . BILLY When a man gets a woman to shedding tears , I count it a good sign . I wish Chloe would cry a little over me . BAILEY This Lewis Merriweather.  --  he comes here a lot , does n't he ? p. 134 BILLY Quite frequent . BAILEY And Miss Lucy likes him . They 're engaged . BILLY Ca n't say . BAILEY And the General likes him . BILLY He do . Says he 's safe  --  rich , getting richer . ( Washington enters . He is in his riding clothes and carries a crop in his hand . ) WASHINGTON ( To Billy . ) : Chloe wants help with the ashes for soap-making . BILLY Yessuh , right off .

Yeh , stick is right . WASHINGTON ( Somewhat coldly . ) : Mrs. Washington asks will you dine with us this evening . BAILEY My thanks , your Excellency , but I must hurry to Annapolis . Mr. Martin and I are on opposing sides before the legislature . I must be there . WASHINGTON Good luck attend you . ( He bows . Bailey turns , then stops. ) p. 135 BAILEY Sir , may I speak to you frankly ? WASHINGTON You have already done so and have my answer . Here I remain . BAILEY ( Boldly . ) : Why do you dislike me ? WASHINGTON ( A little surprised . ) : Certainly I do n't . I respect your  --  er  --  energy , your determination . BAILEY You are opposed to my seeing Lucy  --  Miss Lucy . WASHINGTON Because Lucy is dear to me as my own child . I wish to see her well married . BAILEY I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined someday to marry her . Yes  --  in spite of you and this Merriweather fellow . WASHINGTON ( Controlling his obvious rising anger . ) : I said well-married . Lewis is steady , dependable . BAILEY And I am not ? WASHINGTON You speak frankly , so will I. I find you overhasty in temper , often thoughtless in action , and of a nervous , restless , unstable disposition . I fear Lucy would be unhappy with a man like you . And besides , you are in poverty . BAILEY Which I shall yet remedy . p. 136 WASHINGTON Unless you land in debtors ' prison . BAILEY And that is another evil I shall fight when I become a member of Congress . WASHINGTON And you must remember the time at Brandywine when you disobeyed my orders in foraging for food . BAILEY But I saved my men . I fed them . WASHINGTON I chose to let it pass . BAILEY Thank you for your frank remarks , sir . They are quite crushing  --  enough to make a man want to sink through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . I will prove myself for you  --  and for Lucy . ( He hurries away . Washington stands looking off , idly tapping his riding crop against his boot . The taps become heavy blows . Martha enters for the tea tray . She looks behind her . ) MARTHA Mercy ! Captain Bailey moves like a man afire . Did you make him angry ? WASHINGTON I hope so . MARTHA ( With a glance at her lord . ) : I rather like him . I think Lucy does too . WASHINGTON Do n't you say that , Martha , do n't you ! ( He picks up the tray and bears it off . She follows him . The scene fades out . An instant of darkness , then the sound of handclapping and scattered cheering is heard from the darkness of the center stage . The light comes up there. ) p. 137 Act 2 , Scene 7 Scene 7 Interior of the Maryland state house  --  same as Scene 2 , Act I , except we see a smaller area and the light is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fierce against ratification of the Constitution and is getting some solid confirming applause for his assailing . We see only a few members of his audience , the rest fading off into the shadows . Bailey is seated on the platform behind Martin and awaits his turn to speak . MARTIN ( Tapping a paper in his hand . ) : No wonder , gentlemen , I refused to sign this damnable document . And some who did sign it did so unwillingly . ( Loudly . ) I call on you to demand another convention in which our liberties can be protected . And mark ye , the delegates in Philadelphia were all  --  I repeat all  --  instructed to meet to revise the Articles of Confederation only . Instead they violated their trust and brought forth an entirely new and monstrous instrument  --  an instrument that in time will crush the spirit of our beloved Maryland  --  now free , sovereign and independent  --  crush it in the enslaving shackles of a cruel and overweening central government . Beware , beware ! The voice is Jacob 's but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This flag here , blood-stained on many a battlefield in defence of our liberty , would have to give way to a national flag . Our honored Maryland militia would await not the call of our own elected governor but the call of a national commander , one they name the chief executive and one I name as dictator . Under the terms of this document all power is taken away from Maryland of organizing , arming and disciplining her own soldiers , all power of interstate commerce or foreign shipping , all rights to coin or issue money are taken away , and the damnable slave trade against which I have fought all my life is allowed to continue . The Philadelphia convention sat for four months and behind closed doors and in secrecy . Why secrecy ? Why not all open and aboveboard ? I 'll tell you  --  they did not want knowledge of the foul schemes they were hatching for their own aggrandizements to become known ahead of time . And what was really behind this urge and determination on their part ? ( Stepping forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greed for money . You are looking at a poor man . I own not an acre of land . My life has been given in service to the people  --  even as I am serving you now ! ( Loud applause . ) The majority of the members of the Convention were land owners  --  many of them like George Washington with vast and unjust holdings . With a central , strong-handed government the price of these lands would improve , they thought , and they could be sold to trustins settlers at a higher price . Money ! Money ! They can preach high ideals and justice and opportunity for all , but the prime motivating force in the Philadelphia Convention was commercialism . And once more , to repeat , I declare to you that the principles prescribed herein will absorb  --  yea , necessarily annihilate and absorb , the present legislative , executive and judicial powers of the several states and produce from their ruins one powerful tyrannous consolidated government which from the nature of things and from human nature itself will , as the great Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short of such an iron hand can ever govern as one the widely separated peoples and states and their vast stretching territories . ( His voice soaring . ) And as to the solemnly pronounced ideals , where are they ? Search this document and you will not find them . Where is your right to a free press , to freedom of religion which our beloved state so long ago established ; where our rights of assembly and protection against cruel and unusual punishment ? Where ? ( Shouting . ) Nowhere ! ( Applause . ) I call on this assembly to vote against ratification of this nefarious plan . ( Long applause as he retires , but not too loud . The light goes down . A long chord of music holds . It dies out , the light comes on again . Bailey is speaking . His voice is clear and frank , business-like and authoritative even. ) p. 138 BAILEY The honorable gentleman continues to harp on the enslaving power of the proposed Constitution . Well , sirs , without this Constitution and with the disorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is the freedom he talks about ? Ask the multitudes of honest men lying in jails tonight throughout this land and they will answer for you . With one voice they cry for justice and for freedom  --  ( Holding up his document. )  --  and this Constitution will give them justice and freedom . ( Applause . ) He would let them rot where they are . ( Martin 's voice sounds from the shadows . ) MARTIN I protest ! BAILEY He deplores slavery . So do I. But the fact that it was queried and debated in the Convention and made a matter of concern shows it lies heavy on our conscience and it will in time be eradicated . I dedicate myself to opposing it . ( Applause . ) Let us remind ourselves  --  ( He reads . ) " The Congress shall have power to raise and support armies , to provide and maintain a navy , to suppress insurrection and repel invasions , to borrow money on the credit of the United States . " ( Looking up . ) You go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone of the states . ( Laughter . ) They 're all bankrupt . p. 139 VOICE Right you are . BAILEY " Congress shall have the sole power to coin money . " All State money shall be abolished . A VOICE A good thing . BAILEY A necessary thing . I am glad the honorable member mentioned finance . If there were no other reason for ratifying this Constitution , the need for a solid and strong currency would be sufficient . Ratify this Constitution , gentlemen , and new money will take the place of the old worthless paper . Gold and silver will prevail . Then see the result of this single fact  --  bussiness will respond , jobs will be available , and a new hope will be in every heart . He decries commercialism ! Well , sirs , whatever our ideas , basic to our happiness , basic to these ideals is a sound financial system . Day after day the Federalist papers have propounded this truth  --  the tireless eloquent voices of James Madison and Alexander Hamilton proclaiming it . The honorable gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . They are implicit here  --  implicit in the power of the people to require them  --  ( Reading loudly . ) " We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union  --  to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  --  " Human rights , priceless human rights are the whole purpose of this document , gentlemen , the establishing of these rights . But I agree that for complete and clear understanding among all the people they can be spelled out . And they will be in the form of amendments . A number of states have already declared for this , Massachusetts and Pennsylvania among them . ( Earnestly . ) The voice of Maryland may be the deciding vote as to whether we shall have a new nation , strong and united , or little nations scattered and full of envy and hate . ( Applause . ) Weeks and weeks have gone by . Only six states have ratified  --  Delaware , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Connecticut , Massachusetts and Georgia  --  mark it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter hangs . Opposition is still strong in a number of the states . Gentlemen , Maryland 's action will swing the balance . Rejection here probably would doom the Constitution and lead our people to disaster . ( Vehemently . ) Let Maryland have the proud honor of being the seventh state to ratify and thus provide a majority . This will break the deadlock . Virginia will then follow  --  and as she goes so will New York . This will give us nine states , the three-fourths needed for adoption . The remaining states must in time ratify too . ( Crying out . ) Gentlemen , I move the adoption of the Constitution of the United States of America ! ( Loud applause , cheering. ) p. 140 VOICES Vote ! Vote ! ( The scene fades out .

( Lucy begins turning through her big music book . ) I doubt there 'll be any news tonight . WASHINGTON And that is bad news in itself . Madison said he 'd send an express as soon as the House ratified . They 're still hung in debate . MARTHA If only Mr. Randolph would declare for ratification . WASHINGTON If only Maryland would come through . LEWIS You need n't count on her , sir . Paca and Johnson are against you and there 's the formidable Luther Martin .

Bailey now releases Lucy for a moment and runs about the room , He hugs Billy , kisses Chloe on the cheek , kisses Martha once more and again shakes Washington 's hand . Lucy has turned to the pianoforte and struck a note or two . Bailey looks at Washington . ) And now for you , sir , the heaviest burden of all  --  the presidency of these United States .

Then the loud call  --  " Hail to George Washington , first President of the United States ! " Loud cheering and booming of guns , ringing of distant bells again . Then silence . Washington in a few words speaks of the days ahead . His quiet eloquent idealism . " We are now to take our place among the nations of the world  --  a world whose eyes are upon us .
