Consumers are being endlessly lectured these days on how to save energy by turning down thermostats and turning off lights , but they use only 30% of the nation 's energy ; businesses gulp more than half . Corporate executives have been quite as wasteful as consumers ; some experts estimate that as much as 20% of all the energy used by industry could be saved rapidly by more economical use , with little or no loss of productivity . Now , spurred by the scarcity and rising cost of fuel , a growing number of companies are turning to conserving power with the zeal that they once devoted to cutting inventory . They are finding the savings surprisingly easy . <P> Tuning Boilers . Many companies have found that they can trim energy use 5% to 10% or even more without spending any money , by such simple measures as reducing lighting , lowering temperatures , ensuring that doors and windows stay shut , leaving unused space unheated , tuning boilers and similar equipment to maximum efficiency , and turning off unused machinery . In Bloomfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced lighting by two-thirds in the executive offices of its sprawling building . Like hundreds of other firms , Connecticut General also has reduced lighting in the cafeteria , hallways and the parking lot , cut down the use of fans and air conditioning , and turned off some escalators . As a result , fuel consumption at the site has been reduced by 25% . The Martin Marietta aerospace plant in Denver last week removed every other light in its hallways , and turned off almost all remaining lights after 6 p.m . Refrigeration has been disconnected on all drinking fountains , hot water throughout the plant has been cut from 140 to 120 , and the pressure that drives factory air tools has been dropped by 151bs . <P> As energy prices skyrocket , some companies are going further and making capital outlays-some minor , some potentially sizable-to save more fuel . Some plants began investing even before the fuel shortage . Four years ago an RCA Corp . cabinetmaking plant in Monticello , Ind. , converted its heating systems to burn 30 to 40 tons of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam consumption in half at one of its plants , partly by installing a more efficient heat-transfer process . The investment of $44,000 was offset within a year through lower energy bills . Alcoa has developed a new smelting process that is expected to cut by 30% the amount of electricity needed to produce a pound of aluminum . Since the aluminum industry is one of the most voracious users of power , the process may prove especially valuable .
