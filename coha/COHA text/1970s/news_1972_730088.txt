Beard , a lobbyist , Mr. Merriam and Representative Bob Wilson , Republican of California , gave testimony today that contradicted each others ' statements and testimony by other witnesses . " Somebody 's not telling the truth ; take your pick , " concluded Senator Quentin N. Burdick , Democrat of North Dakota , summing up the day 's testimony . Senator John V. Tunney , Democrat of California , said a special grand jury should be formed to look into the possibility of perjury indictments growing out of " direct conflicts under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier testimony of Mrs. Beard . The memorandum , which has touched off a six-week Investigation , linked I , T.T . ' s " noble commitment " of up to $400,000 to underwrite the expenses of the 1972 Republican National Convention with the Justice De partment 's willingness to settle three antitrust cases against the corporation . Destruction Ordered Mr. Merriam said he had ordered the destruction of any documents that might ember rass the company or its officials . But he said he could not remember if he had ever received the one published by Mr. Anderson because so many memorandums crossed his desk , " Not alleging the kind of information that was contained in the Anderson-Beard memorandum , I trust ? " asked Senator Tunney . " Well , you 'd be surprised , " replied Mr. Merriam . Later , Senator Edward J Gurney , Republican of Florida , drew from Mr. Merriam the assurance that the executive did not mean that the files bulged with other documents as polit ically explosive as the Beard Anderson memorandum , but only that information about foreign operations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statements The following other statements were made today : ( Mr. Wilson , a Republican who represents most of the San Diego area , explained that Mrs. Beard told him in late February that she was not the author of the memorandum published by Mr. Anderson .

" The first time the authenticity of the memorandum was publicly challenged was when I.T.T . and Mrs. Beard branded it a forgery in late March . ( Mr. Wilson testified that Harold S. Geneen , the president of the corporation had made a " personal commitment " to guarantee up to $400,000 of the convention 's expenses in San Diego . Mr. Wilson said this did not contradict Mr. Geneen 's testimony that his commitment was only $200,000 , because Mr. Wilson was certain he could raise enough money from San Diego businessmen so that the full $400,000 would not be needed .

But he said he had since learned that he could not have received that memo because he had not gone to the office on June 25 , the date of the memorandum . ' iMr . Merriam said that out of fear of Mrs. Beard 's wrath , he had falsely told her that he had received an inquiry from the White House about the details of the corporation 's San Diego commitment . He said the truth was that he had dealt with the White House through Jack Gleason , a public relations man whom Mrs. Beard dislikes . At this , Senator Sam J.

He also contradicted her subsequent statement in a television interview that he had instructed her to discuss with Attorney General John N.
