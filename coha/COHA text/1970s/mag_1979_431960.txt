 | Unforgettable Norman Rockwell I FIRST MET Norman Rockwell in 1944 when I became art editor of The Saturday Evening Post . Norman had come to Philadelphia with four cover sketches to show , me . By this time he was a Post superstar whose covers , each time one appeared , increased sales by 250,000 copies . Slender , narrowfaced , with quick , warm brown eyes and a prominent Adam 's apple ( " Norman , " a **25;124;TOOLONG friend once told him , " you have the eyes of an angel and the neck of a chicken ! " ) , the pipe he never ' j smoked clenched in his teeth , he had an appealing , boyish manner tinged on this occasion with a touch of apprehension . He need n't have worried ; the sketches were excellent . He seemed relieved when I okayed them all . " Gosh ! " he said . " Gee ! " @#  | ( These expressions were as close as he ever came to profanity . ) " That 's wonderful ! " Norman held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we became friends , he would act out his cover ideas with great animation and superb mimicry . In my office he would become the old charwoman or the truck driver or the baseball umpire or the wistful young girl . He posed his models that way , too , showing them the exact position he wanted , the precise smile . If he had n't been a master storyteller-in-paint , he could have been a marvelous actor . Norman reminded me of what the great sculptor Brancusi said : " When an artist is no longer a child , he 's dead . " Everything was fresh , fascinating , worthy of Norman 's attention and curiosity . If you lingered too long complimenting him on a finished painting , he would brush it aside with , " Wait until you see the one I 'm working on now ! " But underneath that childlike , occasionally naive exterior was a relentless perfectionism and a limitless capacity for work . Although his imagination supplied the ideas , he painted from life and had to see his subjects first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art school used to tell him . " Live in the picture ! " He was good at that . True realism meant research . Norman loved it . When asked to illustrate 7-Om Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , he spent several days in the Missouri town where Mark Twain once lived , studying the architecture , soaking up atmosphere . To get costumes for his models , he drove around Hannibal buying old clothes off people 's backs ; he even bought the hat off a man 's horse . Another time , prior to painting a battered tomboy sitting defiantly outside the school principal 's office , he put an ad in the local paper for an authentic black eye ? and had to reject the offer of one fan willing to give his daughter a shiner if Norman would choose her as the model ! After the research came the real work , when Norman was happiest . He thought nothing of making a 106 sketch a dozen times , and if a finished painting did n't seem right , he would do it over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it might others ) , he would toss it aside and get on to something else . Some artists paint out of their yesterdays ; certainly Norman did . He was born in a shabby brownstone in New York City in 1894 to a proper Victorian family . In the evening while their father read Dickens aloud to his two sons by gaslight , Norman sketched Fagin , Oliver Twist , Uriah Heep and the rest . In later life he said he had been deeply influenced by Dickens . Clearly , a Dickensian brand of humor and pathos and love of story-telling run through his work . Norman took his skill for granted . " It was just something I had , like a bag of lemon drops . My brother Jarvis could jump over three orange crates ; George Dugan could wiggle his ears ; I could draw . " The family lived in a series of boardinghouses where the faces and mannerisms of the boarders made an indelible impression on the boy . In summer , the Rockwell family repaired to farms that took in paying guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings that never left him , and that was clearly reflected in his works ' affinity for the dreams and accomplishments of heartland America . At 16 , he enrolled in the National Academy School in New York , and later studied at the more progressive Art Students League . His illustrations began to sell , and when work first appeared on the Post er in 1916 , other magazine d swung open . ( During his career paintings appeared on a remark 323 Post covers . ) After a brief stint in the during World War I , Norman sumed his career . A new maga Liberty , offered to double his pr he 'd leave the Post . Prodded by and friends to take advantage o proposal , he hesitantly reported Post editor George Horace Lori " What do you intend to do ? " great editor asked . Lorimer 's cl hand was on the desk , Norman me , and though his expression di change , his knuckles turned w " Stay with the Post , " gulped man . " In that case , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money meant a more la life . His wife Irene liked s events . Norman tried . He yachting on Long Island Sound fell off horses in Central Park ; b was not the country-club type 1929 he and Irene agreed to a vorce . After a brief , unhappy pe of bachelorhood , he married Barstow . She bore him three and the marriage lasted until death in 1959 . When I first wor with him , Norman 's love of cou living had taken him to Arlingt Vt. ; I think half the population the town eventually turned up Post covers . Later he and moved to Stockbridge , Mass . Norman never minded hav people in his studio as he work  | He asked them for their opinions nd took suggestions seriously . There was something about his casual manner that enabled people to %peak honestly . One day my wife Katharine was in the studio when a carpenter came in to make some repairs . Norman asked him what he thought of the painting on the easel . The carpenter peered at it . " The color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he offered . " It 's too bright . " " Thanks , " said Norman . The next day Katharine noticed that the color had been changed . Not all of his covers were successes . Once he painted a teacher of craggy and spinsterish mien , and the Post received baskets of letters from infuriated schoolmarms . " Gosh , " said Norman ruefully , " I did n't mean they all looked like that ! " But by now a Rockwell painting of a policeman or a soda jerk was regarded across America'as the prototype of the profession . In 1952 a new dimension appeared in Norman 's work . When Dwight D. Eisenhower became the Republican candidate for President , we decided to put the General 's portrait on the rover . Ike was in Denver at the convention but was about to leave to go trout fishing . He agreed to sit for a portrait if Rockwell was in Denver by nine the next morning . Somehow Norman got there in time . At 10:30 that morning , Denver time , he telephoned me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many artists ould work fast but this was astonishing . When Norman came in with @# the cover portrait he brought along six smaller paintings : five of Ike and one of Mamie . They were charming . Each had a different facial expression . I asked what they were for . " Oh , golly , Ken , " he said , " five thousand dollars ( his normal fee ) is just too much money for an hour and a half 's work , so I thought maybe you could also use these . " We did , on our inside pages . ( The General later told me that he did n't care much for the cover portrait , but figured it brought him three million votes . ) Norman often gave away paintings to friends who admired his work . " Do n't you want one ? " he once asked me reproachfully . I said , " Yes , I 'd love to have one . " " Which ? " Norman asked . I was flustered by his directness . Since " Saying Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How about this one ? " So he gave it to me , as casually  | as another might bestow a cigar . It is classic Rockwell : a gallery of American faces caught in an interplay of emotions , a story-in-a-scene combining a deep reverence for traditional values with an extraordinary realism . It was his most popul cover , and it served me well : wh some eager artist would come with a cover , I would prop it agai Norman 's huge painting , hop ' that the contrast would give the art  | such a case of the humbles that he would find it awkward to ask for more money . It worked , too . Through the years , critics faulted Rockwell for not being something he never thought he was ? an artist like Vermeer or Matisse . Norman knew he was a marvelous limner of the nicer side of American life , a man whose love for the unabashedly wholesome brought pleasure to an enormous number of people . As itch he had no equal . But the critics annoyed him just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow would occasionally throw him into a spell of depression . At such times I found myself in the curious position of tying to give encouragement to the Host beloved artist in America . Once Robert Beverly Hale , then orator of American painting at the Metropolitan Museum in New York , eked for a Rockwell painting . Any tic , he said , would do . Norman said , Ill do ' em a special one . " And he id . It was a smaller version of his Freedom of Speech . " I later asked lob Hale why they wanted it . Well , " he said , " a thousand years rim now people might want to now what Americans looked like in he loth century . So we thought we 'd better have a Rockwell . " By the early 1960s , things were hanging at the Post . New people were coming in , and in 1962 I moved n The Reader 's Digest. * Gradually Norman 's relationship with the Post . also came to an end . He was still in great demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was still incredible , but the warmth and humanity were not there . He missed the old Post audience . He missed the letters that came in hundreds after each cover . He had answered them all himself . The years were passing for all of us , but Norman seemed indestructible until 1974 , when a Paul Gallico story came in to The Digest . Knowing that Norman admired Gallico , I phoned to ask if he would illustrate it . He said he 'd love to . After several weeks nothing had happened . When I phoned Norman , he could n't remember our earlier conversation . When he asked who Paul Gallico was , I could barely answer . By mid-1978 Norman Rockwell was a wasted shadow attended by Molly , his third wife , and two nurses . He did n't quite make it to his 85th birthday ; on November 8 , 1978 , he died . The little church at Stockbridge was filled with neighbors whose faces had appeared on so many canvases through the years . An eloquent little sign hung on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3 p.m. today in respect for Mr. Rockwell . " An illustrator , who had loved Norman 's work , wrote me a note that might serve as his epitaph : " How much richer this nation is for Norman 's having been among us . His whole life was built upon decency and trust and a never-failing faith in the worth of people . "
