" Allahu akbar ! Allahu akbar ! " The Arabic pronouncement that " God is great " sustained the Iranian revolutionaries as they marched through the streets of Tehran in demonstrations against the Shah . The invocation was heard again as students attacked the U.S. embassy , and as mobs last week marched about the captured compound , demanding death for the hostages . <P> To what extent was the student action-and the Ayatullah Khomeini 's endorsement of it-in accordance with Islamic law ? Experts differ . Zaki Badawi , Egyptian director of the Islamic Cultural Center in London , argues that " the demand for the return of the Shah to face trial in Iran is in agreement with Muslim law . " Islam holds that " no one is above the law and law is supreme . If a crime is committed by a ruler , an emperor , he is as liable to punishment for it as the meanest and commonest of his subjects . " As a precedent , one Cairo expert notes that in 1964 the late King Saud of Saudi Arabia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct unbecoming a Muslim ruler-namely , drinking , gambling and womanizing . <P> Islamic scholars are virtually unanimous in condemning the seizure of the hostages as contrary to the Shari'a ( Islamic canon law ) . Says Badawi : " There is no basis in Islam for this . Islam does not justify the taking of hostages , and it also clearly states that one person can not be punished for the crimes of another . " Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , a devout Muslim , has denounced Khomeini as a " lunatic " and forthrightiy condemned the seizure of the hostages . " This is not Islam , " he said . " Islam teaches love , tolerance and mercy . " One of the ranking experts on Islamic law , at Cairo 's ancient Al Azhar University , charges that the Ayatullah 's " evil hunger for the death of a sick man is a towering crime under Islamic law . " Islam " considers any sick or dying person with extreme humility , " he says . Rouhollah Ramanzani , an Iranian scholar teaching at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if an undesirable individual enters into the Muslim domain , then that person must be protected and escorted to the boundaries of that domain to let him out safely . " <P> Most authorities doubted that the students would physically harm the hostages , or that Khomeini would tolerate their torture or death . Says Thomas Ricks , an Iranian expert at Georgetown University : " Nothing in Islam could justify the slaughter of the hostages , and it is unthinkable that the captors would do so , unless they were threatened by an outside attack . " Professor Hamid Algar of the University of California at Berkeley notes that the Shari'a permits both the exchange of hostages and their unilateral release by captors . He also observes , however , that " one tradition is that hostages may be kept permanently . "
