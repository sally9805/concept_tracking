Of all the disasters that could be caused by a severe earthquake , perhaps none is so frightening as the destruction of a nuclear power plant . Ruptured by the heaving of the once solid ground , it would release radioactive particles into the air . There , they could form a colorless , odorless cloud that would contaminate everything in its path , poisoning the land , killing some people , causing cancer in others . <P> To guard against this horror , the now disbanded Atomic Energy Commission and its successor , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , have enforced strict rules . All atomic power plants located in earthquake zones must be constructed to withstand the most severe shaking ever recorded in the area . But geologists keep finding new earthquake faults-sometimes after construction has started . The latest example is an almost completed $1 billion nuclear facility on the California coast . <P> The Diablo Canyon plant is being built about 12 miles from San Luis Obispo by Pacific Gas &; Electric Co. , the nation 's second largest investor-owned electric utility ( 1975 revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactors that will produce 2.2 million kilowatts of electricity . One reactor is nearly ready to go into operation ; the other will be finished in August 1977 . When construction started in 1968 , PG &E; knew all about the San Andreas fault , 45 miles inland , and the Rinconada fault , some 20 miles away . So its engineers designed the plant to survive a quake registering 6.75 on the Richter scale. * The concrete foundations are 14 ft. thick , for example , and a cross section of the mammoth dome over each reactor would show 3 ft. of concrete , liberally laced with steel reinforcing rods . <P> In 1971 , however , Shell Oil Co. geologists prospecting offshore found an underwater fault that runs only 2 miles west of Diablo Canyon . At first , this Hosgri fault was thought to be inactive . But studies sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey revealed that it was probably responsible for a 1927 quake estimated at 7.25 on the Richter scale . PG &E; experts dispute that conclusion , insisting that a more distant fault caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed with a sufficient margin of safety to survive any probable jolt in the area . <P> Higher Rates . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must now decide whether to grant the plant an operating license . For safety 's sake , it can delay the license until the building is strengthened further . That might help soothe widespread public fears about the safety of not only the Diablo Canyon plant itself-which critics are now attacking-but also about nuclear energy in general . This is an especially important consideration in California , where citizens will vote in June on a proposal that in effect would block more atomic power plants in the state . On the other hand , if PG &E; is correct , buttressing the plant would cost millions of dollars , which would be passed on to consumers in higher electricity rates . The NRC says it will decide by March 1 . If it gives a go-ahead , it must then live with the chance of being wrong . <P> <P> *By this measure , a jolt with a magnitude of 2 at its epicenter is barely perceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The worst recorded quake in the U.S. ( 1964 in Alaska ) hit 8.4.
