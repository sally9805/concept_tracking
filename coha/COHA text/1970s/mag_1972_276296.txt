FORTUNE 'S annual compilation of figures for the nation 's 500 largest industrial companies , published this week , serves as a kind of X ray of the corporate sector of the U.S. economy : it illuminates trends that can be discerned only dimly in individual company reports . Among last year 's notable tendencies were a somewhat disconcerting ability of the big companies to cut employment while increasing sales , a continued sharp decline in merger activity and what looks like the beginning of a turn away from diversification . <P> Overall , 1971 was a middling-good year for the 500 . They increased total sales 8.4% , to nearly $503 billion , and profits 8% , to $23.4 billion . The figures , however , are considerably distorted by the standout performance of General Motors , which benefited from a banner year for auto sales . By itself , G.M. accounted for three-quarters of the profit gain posted by the entire group . Other giants got bigger , too . Seven companies joined the once-exclusive billion-dollar-sales club , raising membership to 127 . The newcomers : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell Soup , Iowa Beef Processors and CBS . Meanwhile , Standard Oil of California became the twelfth U.S. company to register sales of more than $5 billion a year . <P> The 500 also slightly increased their leverage in the U.S. economy-though in such a way as to raise questions about their efficiency . Last year they accounted for 66% of all sales by industrial companies , up from 65% in 1970 and little more than 50% a decade earlier . Their share of industrial profits , however , stayed put at 75% , almost unchanged from 1970 . Obviously , smaller companies have been increasing their profitability more rapidly than the large corporations , suggesting perhaps that some of the 500-G.M. excluded-have pushed past their optimum size . <P> In one respect , the 500 demonstrated a pointed kind of efficiency : they sliced employment by 2% , to 14.3 million , while increasing sales . As a result , their average sales per employee rose 10% , to $35,166 . G.M. , Ford and ITT , the three biggest employers , all added to their payrolls . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force 8.5% , letting 33,600 people go . <P> Other highlights : <P> &gt; Only two mergers occurred among the 500 last year : National Steel acquired Granite City Steel , and General Host took over Cudahy . That was the smallest number since 1958 ; it compared with a recent peak of 23 in 1968 . Apparently , the Justice Department 's opposition to big mergers is helping to hold them down . <P> &gt; Twenty-four companies wrote off a startling total of $1.5 billion in various losses last year , and some of the largest represented the cost of unwinding profitless diversification . RCA wrote off $490 million as the expected loss on liquidation of its computer business . American-Standard has shucked its mining-equipment and air-conditioning divisions , and is getting out of recreational-land development , mobile-home parks and foreign housing . Writeoff : $122 million .
