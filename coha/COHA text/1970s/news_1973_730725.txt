txt " Like a moon in June . like a fork needs a spoon . like a song needs a tune " ? do country music and New York go together ? The very presence of the country couple Tammy Wynette ( " Stand by Your Man " ) and George Jones ( " White Lightning " ) singing their " We Go Together " song in Philharmonic Hall twangs of a big " yes . " After all , they were singing the first country-music concert ever to be held In Lincoln Center , on the first day a mayor had proclaimed as " Country Music Day in New York City " ; in the first week a slicky city magazine had featured the " Cornball In vasion " on its cover ; as well as the first full month a New York radio station had ever broadcast all-country music . Country music and New York may not only go together , but New York may need country music more than country music needs New York . Simple stories , simply told Country music is in simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " sad sloggin ' tear-jerkers " George Jones calls them ) . " Country music is not tearing down music , but it offers hope , ' says John ( Jack ) Van Buren Sullivan , general manager of WyIN . " Many of the people who have liked this music over the years have had little but hope . " Mr. Sullivan thinks New Yorkers can relate to such music . " Why the man on Wall Street , " he said , " is hoping his stock does n't go down . " " I 'll just keep on falling in love till I get It right , " pledges the persistent and often pleading Tammy Wynette , who like many country singers is a symbol of hope . A hairdresser , who loved to sing , she ended up marrying her long-time favorite singer , George Jones , and in the past 4% years has sold 9 million records and grossed more than $30 million . Clean and wholesome As for the listener , " country music brings out the best in a person , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two sons , his brother , and sister , to hear the Wynette-Jones concert .

Ca n't you just see how much in love Tammy Wynette and George Jones are ? " // *Country music in New York // Some record stores in the New York area are already reporting an increase in country-music sales as part of the potential 19 million people are being exposed to it over WHN : The Country Music Association ( CMA ) in Nashville claims that 16 percent of all records sold in the U.S. are country-music records . That is not surprising when one discovers that in 1961 there were 81 full-time country stations in the U.S. and Canada . Stations multiply But by April 1972 there were 806 full-time country stations , and an additional 1,046 stations that programmed country music three hours or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours or less of the music . ( Since WHN 's format wanders off into talk shows and ballgames , it is considered by CMA to be a part-time country station . ) In 1967 radio station WBRZ in Hackensack N.J. picked up the Nashville sound , but the station had a weak signal , never got the support WHN is getting from the country musicians and Nashville performers ? " Hackensack sounded too much like Nashville " ? and until now the area has been without a country station since 1970 . The sound of country in New York is a smoother sound and the twanginess of a Roy Acuff or an Ernest Tubb takes a back seat to the kind of country music which has jumped over into the " Top 40 . " These include records like Glen Campbell 's " By the Time I Get to Phoenix , " Ray Price 's " For the Good Times , " Jeannie C. Riley 's " Harper Valley PTA , " and the " Dueling Banjos Theme " from the movie " Deliverance .

True-to-life quality Many feel that New York will change country music , slick it down , smooth it out , and take away its genuineness . " They are true to life , them people , " maintains Mr. Macken , " and when you are true to life nothing will change you . " And while the New Yorker may have to strain as much as those down south to imagine it being " Two Below in Tupelo , " it seems possible that he can happily sing along with Ernie Tibb " Walking the Floor Over You . " One can even imagine the Mayor bowing out of City Hall while singing with Lynn Anderson " I Never Promised You a Rose Garden . "
