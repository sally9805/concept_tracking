It has been snowing in Moscow since Sept. 24 . For much of that time , the thermometer has huddled between zero and 15 F. The Russians love it . From his toasty ( 75 ) office on Kutuzovsky Prospekt , TIME 'S Moscow correspondent , Marsh Clark , explained why : <P> The Russians have a symbiotic relationship with cold . For them , snow is a matter of both pride and necessity . It was , after all , General Winter as much as any Russian field marshal who saved the capital from Napoleon and Hitler . Without a heavy covering of snow , the winter wheat crop suffers . The " worst " winter in recent years was that of 1975 , when almost no snow fell and the Soviets had to spend scarce hard currency for foreign grain to feed their populace and livestock . <P> Besides , the Russians know how to cope with cold . Moscow , Kiev , Leningrad and other major cities all have superefficient subway systems , as well as good if overcrowded bus and streetcar service . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no traffic jams or parking problems . In any case , the streets are swept bone-dry by thousands of snowplows . Giant " snow eater " machines called snegouborki scoop up the snow and dump it onto conveyor belts , which deposit it in trucks , which unload it into the Moskva River . As the first flakes fall , at any hour of day or night one can hear the scritch-scratch of individual snow shovels and brooms , generally woman-powered . <P> Through all this , the trains run fantastic distances-usually on time . Since most intercity travelers in Russia go by rail , Soviet engineers have long since learned to beat the bugs that so often stall U.S. commuter railroads . <P> The Russians have no special tricks for keeping warm . Every man wears a shapka , a fur ( muskrat , rabbit , squirrel , fox or Persian lamb ) hat with ear flaps . Everyone wears warm boots ; the best are the felt valenki favored by villagers . People who work outdoors wear , of course . Soviet Union suits . After a long spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolt of vodka and a hunk of fatback . <P> <P> Buildings are mostly heated by a central supply system that feeds them steam through underground lines . The main fuel in Russia is-weep , amerikantsy-natural gas , piped from Soviet Central Asia and Siberia . ( The Soviet Union has one-fourth of the world 's natural-gas reserves , but has instituted a widespread fuel-conservation program nonetheless . ) Because natural gas is the cleanest-burning fuel of all , there is no air pollution . <P> As I write , it 's zero outside . Snow is falling . But the Muscovites on their way to homes , universities or theaters this evening do not display the dour , inward-hunched , God-help-us visages of cold-stricken New Yorkers or Chicagoans . Snow is their friend , and servant .
