In white , middle-income Forest Hills , N.Y. , last week angry crowds booed the bulldozers that were breaking ground for a proposed low-income housing project that would bring numbers of blacks into the area ( TIME , Nov. 29 ) . One resident , Mrs. Ann Schachter , mother of two small schoolchildren , admits that she is embarrassed by the pickets . Still , she adds , typically enough : " I like to think of myself as a liberal , but the term does n't seem to apply to me any more . I 'm frightened . " Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser , who favors the project , says of the protesters : " They are afraid of what they see as these hostile forces breaking into their island . " <P> Mayor John Lindsay 's associates proclaimed that the project would proceed , but there were signs of queasiness at City Hall ; last week the Board of Estimate turned down a similar proposal for Lindenwood , another section of Queens . Also last week , despite a personal appeal from New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Romney gave the <P> Forest Hills plans his final imprimatur . <P> Romney is the pivotal figure in any serious nationwide attempt to break down the ghetto and establish low-income housing in communities like Forest Hills . With 650,000 units of low-and moderate-income housing scheduled for construction in the next year , he faces the intricate task of translating fair-housing legislation into hard reality . Romney is in a precarious position , working within an Administration that has shown , at best , limited enthusiasm for racial integration . Last week , at his home in the plush , predominantly white Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills , Romney talked to TIME Correspondent Jess Cook . <P> " The Forest Hills project is one that increases opportunity for low-and moderate-income families , " he said . " I 'm wholeheartedly in favor of making that possible . It was a product of local responsibility and planning , that means the New York City administration . It does n't seem to me that the Federal Government can shape its programs on the basis of what individuals or groups have to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , any neighborhood , for policies laid down by Congress and responsible state and local officials . " <P> Mobility and Diversity . Continued Romney : " A successful program must avoid causing the majority of Americans to dig in their heels . If that happens , if they insist on the status quo , then believe you me we 're through . On the other hand , there must be sufficient tangible progress so that minority Americans , at least most of them , will decide that the problem is going to be solved within our present structure . " <P> As a Mormon and a politician , Romney has the approach of a pragmatic evangelist . " There 's nothing wrong with enclaves , " he concludes , " as long as they do n't prevent the opportunity to locate where the jobs are . I do n't think anyone knows what patterns are going to develop when American citizens all enjoy mobility and diversity of choice . But I 'm convinced we ca n't restrict black Americans , or brown , or yellow or any other kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit them that fundamental opportunity . "
