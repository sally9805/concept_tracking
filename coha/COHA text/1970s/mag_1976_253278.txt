THE BAD NEWS BEARS Directed by MICHAEL RITCHIE Screenplay by BILL LANCASTER <P> Coach Morris Buttermaker passes out on the pitcher 's mound during practice . Scraping himself together , he sips a few cold ones in the dugout while watching his team take the field for the first game . Score at the end of the first half of the first inning : 26 to zip . Buttermaker ( Walter Matthau ) figures it is time to forfeit . He has nothing to lose but his pains , and there are nine of them on his team , with a couple of alternates thrown in for good measure . <P> Quite unexpected , entirely welcome , The Bad News Bears is a fracturing comedy of honor , victory and defeat in the Little League . Yes , the Little League , which Director Michael Ritchie ( Smile , Downhill Racer ) turns into a target for a brassy , good-humored satire on Middle-American values . <P> The Bad News Bears is about a fictional Southern California version of the Little League called the North Valley League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams , and the boozy Buttermaker is a fitting leader for them . A former minor league pro now reduced to cleaning pools for a living , Butter-maker has no particular affection for kids . He does not care much for baseball , either . Just now , boilermakers are his main passion . <P> The Bears may be terrible , but they are enthusiastic . Misfits all , playing-even miserably-gives them a shot at self-respect . Buttermaker considers this and , out of his beery fog , figures the kids deserve a break . His motives are not entirely altruistic , however . On a rival team , there is a gung-ho , supercilious coach ( well played by Vic Morrow ) , and Buttermaker hates his guts . <P> Heavy Hitter . To beef up his goofball outfit , Buttermaker recruits a couple of sawed-off powerhouses . Amanda Whurlitzer ( Tatum O'Neal ) , the tomboy daughter of an old flame of Buttermaker 's , is expert in the fine art of the fastball and the spitter ; Kelly Leak ( Jackie Earle Haley ) , a local terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy hitter . He also has the hots for Amanda . With Kelly and Amanda on the team , the Bears start to win . <P> Ritchie and Writer Bill Lancaster ( Burt 's son ) are especially shrewd in showing how a game for kids is converted into a contest of egos for their elders . The movie is calculated and a little cute . It relies too heavily on the amusement value of hearing little kids cuss like Marines . Yet The Bad News Bears is also tough-minded . It does not turn Buttermaker into a lovable codger , and the kids do not become last-minute victors . <P> Grumbling all the way , gargling his booze , Matthau is better than he has been in years , and all the kids are wonderful , full of spirit and spunk . ( Inquires one fearless sad sack of a combative rival : " How 'd you like me to stick that bat where the sun never shines ? " ) The movie has some very traditional concerns-about the value of playing as opposed to winning , about trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with charm . <P> Surprisingly , improbably , The Bad News Bears is the year 's funniest movie . It is very much like the team itself : no serious threat at first , but , finally , tough to beat .
