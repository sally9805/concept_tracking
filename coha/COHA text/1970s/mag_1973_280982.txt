Schumann : Fantasiestcke , Op. 12 ; Davidsbndlertnze , Op. 6 ( Murray Perahia , pianist ; Columbia ; $5.98 ) . Schumann 's piano music-a blend of heroic stride , demonic fantasy and impish humor-requires the age-spanning wisdom and maturity of a Richter or Rubinstein ; rarely are the upstart young up to it . In this brilliant recording debut , Bronx-born Murray Perahia , 26 , who last year became the first American to win Britain 's Leeds International Competition , proves himself to be the rare exception to that rule . Indeed , Perahia may well take a place as the most eloquent lyric virtuoso since the days of the late Dinu Lipatti . <P> Prokofiev : Romeo and Juliet ( Cleveland Orchestra , Lorin Maazel , conductor ; London ; 3 LPs ; $17.94 . London Symphony Orchestra , Andre Previn , conductor ; Angel ; 3 LPs ; $17.98 ) . A typical instance of how the classical record industry can drive its customers berserk and eat up its own profits . The complete version of this score has been almost totally neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come two competing versions . Ah , free enterprise ! Both sets manage to confirm that this is the finest evening-length ballet score since Tchaikovsky . Neither , as it happens , quite equals the poetry and passion of Charles Munch and the Boston Symphony in their old single LP of excerpts ( RCA Victrola ) , but both are otherwise excellent . Maazel has an edge by virtue of his more incisive phrasing , livelier tempos and London 's more spacious ( and , appropriately at times , more sepulchral ) sonics . <P> Puccini : La Bohme ( Mirella Freni , Luciano Pavarotti , Berlin Philharmonic , Herbert von Karajan , conductor ; London ; 2 LPs ; $11.96 ) . The LP era has had three recordings of Bohme good enough to be called great . The first two were the Toscanini ( with Licia Albanese and Jan Peerce as Mimi and Rodolfo ) and the Beecham ( Victoria de los Angeles and Jussi Bjoerling ) , both still available in low-priced reissues . Here is the third , with the unpredictable Karajan sculpting the orchestral part with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songfulness that Beecham might have applauded . The bella voce cast is the finest ever assembled to record this work . <P> Beethoven : Piano Sonatas , Op. 31 , Nos. 1 , 2 ( " Tempest " ) and 3 ( Glenn Gould ; Columbia ; $5.98 ) . Hindemith : Piano Sonatas Nos. 1 , 2 and 3 ( Glenn Gould ; Columbia ; $5.98 ) . It is now a decade since the happy hypochondriac of music abandoned the recital stage to devote his life to producing radio documentaries in his native Canada , staying warm ( he still wears sweaters and mufflers on the balmiest days ) and , fortunately for the rest of the world , continuing to make some of the finest , most original and pleasantly outrageous recordings of the day .
