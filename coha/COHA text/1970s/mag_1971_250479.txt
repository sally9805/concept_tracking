The San Francisco Chronicle 's resident humorist , Arthur Hoppe , was in a rare , melancholy mood . In his column , Hoppe wrote : " The radio this morning said the Allied invasion of Laos had bogged down . Without thinking , I nodded and said , ' Good . ' And having said it , I realized the bitter truth : Now I root against my own country . That is how far we have come in this hated and endless war . " <P> Some of Hoppe 's syndicated newspapers , including the Atlanta Constitution and the Boston Herald Traveler , refused to print the column . Hoppe had obviously touched a nerve . He wrote of his love for his country in World War II and his feeling now that " I have come to the dank and lightless bottom of the well . " Of the 941 letters that Hoppe had received last week about the column , 923 praised it . Wrote a housewife in Hollister , Calif. : " I asked my 12-year-old son to read it aloud and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what makes otherwise steady grownups burst into tears . " A former Army colonel found himself harboring the " nightmarish feelings you 've put down about wanting the enemy to win . " <P> Such thoughts , which could scarcely have been admitted a year or two ago , still sound treasonable . Yet it is not basically a matter of treason , but a deep , almost nihilistic weariness . Since it long ago became clear that an American " victory " in Viet Nam is impossible , the overriding desire now is for a clear-cut finish .
