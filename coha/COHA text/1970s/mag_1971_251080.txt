WHILE troubles piled up in Congress for President Nixon last week , he announced a series of surprise summit meetings that will have him jet-hopping from island to island and coast to coast over the next two months . It was something of a whirling-dervish act with a serious motive : before he undertakes his historic mission to China , he wants to make sure that key heads of state have been consulted and accommodated . Under the watchful eye of Henry Kissinger , the President will meet with : <P> &gt; French President Georges Pompidou for two days in mid-December in the Azores ; <P> &gt; British Prime Minister Edward Heath the following week in Bermuda ; &gt; West German Chancellor Willy Brandt , who will come to Key Biscayne , Fla. , in late December ; &gt; Japanese Premier Eisaku Sato , who will visit San Clemente in January ; &gt;Canada 's Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , almost certainly , at some point not yet determined . <P> This unprecedented round of summit talks is intended to deliver a clear message to Peking : the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he arrives in China but for the Western world as well . <P> France was singled out for the initial meeting because of the role it had played in arranging the China trip ; Paris had served as an intermediary between Washington and Peking , smoothing out many details . Beyond that , President Pompidou has been the latest Western leader to talk to Soviet Boss Leonid Brezhnev , and Nixon is anxious to know what is on the Russian 's mind before he goes to China . Nixon feels he enjoys a special relationship with Pompidou . " I find the French President a man very much like myself , " he once remarked . The French President reciprocates the feeling . On leaving the U.S. after a visit in 1970 , Pompidou remarked that he and Nixon shared a " communion of temperament . " <P> <P> The talks with Pompidou , Heath and Brandt will be far-ranging . They will include the forthcoming European security conference and the proposed mutual reduction of forces between the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO countries . Since Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international economic impasse will also be discussed - though not likely resolved ( see THE ECONOMY ) . The summit conference with Sato will give the Prime Minister a badly needed boost at home , where his reputation has been seriously damaged by the sudden U.S. policy reversals on both China and international trade . <P> Campaign Dilemma . To keep American power from being undermined at a critical stage in overseas developments , the President ordered an all-out lobbying effort to defeat the Mansfield Amendment , which would have reduced U.S. forces in Europe by 60,000 . Though the proposal was heavily supported in the beginning , it was defeated in the Senate last week by a comfortable 15-vote margin . The President 's domestic design did not fare so well . He had urged Congress to pass a $27.4 billion tax cut to stimulate the economy . The House gave him about what he asked for , but the Senate handed him much more than he wanted : another $11 billion in tax relief , mainly for individuals .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
