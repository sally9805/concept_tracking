txt  | Sex education is currently one of the most controversial and least understood of issues confronting the public school system . Certain segments of the public endorse it as a proper and necessary part of the curriculum , whereas others denounce it as being dangerous to the development of youth . The contrasting views with respect to the propriety and necessity of sex education in the public schools could be greatly resolved if a mutual understanding and definition of the term " sex education " were accepted by all . Unfortunately some states have enacted laws providing for sex education to be taught in the public schools without defining what it entails . Other states , however , in providing for sex education in the curriculum , have stipulated quite adequately the coverage of issues to be included in the instruction . A Michigan statute is illustrative :  | Sex education is the preparation for personal relationships between the sexes by providing appropriate educational opportunities designed to help the individual develop understanding , acceptance , respect and trust for himself and others . Sex education includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and understanding of the individual needs . It involves the examination of man 's and woman 's roles in society , how they relate and react to supplement each other , the responsibilities of each towards the other throughout life and the development of responsible use of human sexuality as a positive and creative force ( Mich . Comp . Laws Ann . art . 349.789 ( Supp. 1969 ) ) . Numerous definitions of sex education are also supplied by recognized authorities on the subject . For example , a Professor of Child and Family Studies and Director of the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University writes : It may help to define what we mean by sex education . Included , of course , would be basic facts that adolescents need to know ? information on sexual maturation , pregnancy , birth controls , sexual intercourse , etc . In short , this would cover the essential " plumbing " that is generally taught in the human reproduction sequence in biology or health ( in many schools , this is all that is taught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moralistically ) . Information on venereal disease ? how it is spread , its effects ,  | treatment , and prevention ? should also be available in schools . But the area of sex education that is most needed , and in the long run , will be the most effective in curbing irresponsible sex , disease , and pregnancy , deals with the basic attitudes and orientations to all human relationships ... ( p. 186 ) . One of the most important aspects of sexuality that is rarely covered in high schools is parenting . Adolescents are very interested in how to be a parent at this stage , both because they are acutely aware of their own parents ' shortcomings and because they now have the capacity to actually become parents . Invaluable advice for students should include how to handle their children 's swearing , masturbation , nudity , dating , and requests for birth control ( p. 188 ) . ( Sol Gordon , " What Place Does Sex Education Have in the Schools ? " The Journal of School Health , April 1974 , pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is defined above is generally acceptable to the public . But to some , sex education suggests a destruction of moral and ethical concepts of youth by stressing sexual intercourse , contraception , premarital relations , abortions , and pornography . In fact some people express fear that an introductory course in sex education could develop into a program such as exists in Sweden , which they consider radical and dangerous . The responsibility for sex education should be shared by the parents , social services in the corn- community and , particularly , the schools . Unfortunately , however , sex information to youth is most frequently provided by peers , which results in a conglomeration of leading questions followed by equally leading and vague replies , resulting in misinformation and misconception . One writer , cognizant of this fact , states : Left to themselves , adolescents gather their information from their ill-informed age mates or through experimentation or experience . Girls are more likely to get information from their parents , but not uniformly so . Often the information divulged by the parent is sketchy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , in particular , spend considerable time talking about sex .... The result is often a hodge-podge of misinformation , half-true guesses or shrewd surmises , folklore , and out-and-out misconceptions which can only be cleared up by actual experience or a proper course of sex education . As a matter of fact , even actual experience fails to answer questions or clear up misconceptions ... . 551 ) . ( " Sex Education : Constitutional Limits of State Compulsion , " Southern California Law Review , vol. 43 , no. 3 , 1970 , pp. 548-569 . ) The harm from peer group sex education is worsened by readily available pornographic literature . The primary criticism of pornographic communication is that it reveals too much , too soon , resulting in psychological damage . Although some experts on the problem minimize the harm resulting from the actual reading or viewing of pornographic material itself , they are concerned that the children keep such  | communication to themselves thereby denying their parents any opportunity to ratify or reject their comments . Consequently the family then lose substantial control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred from the above that sex education would be amply provided if left in the hands of parents . Some authorities estimate that approximately only five per cent of all children are given any sex education in the home . Moreover , even among that small percentage group , it is unlikely that the sex education is timely , well-conceived or beneficial . With the value limitations of sex education as provided by peers , parents , social services and religious groups , the responsibility falls most appropriately on the public schools . The state , acting through the school and the mandatory attendance of children , is in the advantageous position to ensure that all are adequately educated , which certainly includes sex education as one of the most vital phenomena of living ? love , courtship , mating and procreation . Even though sex education should be available to all children , the mildly-retarded children are often denied that to which they are entitled . Because of the paucity of research on the subject a survey ( Dewaine A. Alcorn , " Parental Views on Sexual Development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Special Education , vol. 8 , no. 2 , Summer 1974 , pp. 119-130 ) was designed to explore certain aspects of sexuality in the TMR as well as attitudes of parents toward sex education of the retarded .  | In general the survey indicated that the sexual behavior and attitude of the mentally retarded was not greatly unlike that of normal children . Moreover , the parents of TMR children were no more opposed to sexual education for their children than were others . Several parents commented that living on a farm was a good education in itself . While a majority of parents of the TMR children expressed favor for some sex education , a minority did not , as typified by such comments as : " You let one person take God out of the schools and you sure put in Sex . You are more nuts than the retarded . If they are innocent let them stay that way . We hope no overzealous leader or teacher will try to put any big ideas ' in a sweet child like mine . Put them away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Comments such as these would cause one to wonder who was the more retarded ? the child or the parent . In a somewhat similar investigation ( Gary Tuchin , " Sexual Attitudes of Mothers of Retarded Children , " The Journal of School Health , November 1974 , vol . XLIV , no. 9 , pp. 490-492 ) , an abstract of the article states : Forty-four mothers were interviewed to assess their attitudes toward the sexual behavior , sex education , birth control , marriage , and dating of their TMR adolescents . Religion influenced mothers ' attitudes toward masturbation and marriage . Although many mothers expected that their children would develop the ability to date , most of them felt that their children would never be  | able to marry . Mothers wanted sex education taught in the schools , and they desired the formulation of parent groups to aid them in understanding the sexuality of their children ( p. 490 ) . Sex education is needed by all youth . This includes the pregnant teenager , married or unmarried . This problem will be discussed somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material is available to school authorities who seek information for incorporating a program of sex education in the curriculum . Numerous publications , authored by experts in their fields , offer guidelines which may be helpful . The following authoritative comments which may serve as guiding principles in developing a sex education program are made in an article ( Howard S. Hayman , " Sex Education and our Core Values , " The Journal of School Health , vol . XLIV , no. 2 , February 1974 , pp. 62-69 ) : Sex education , like politics , is the art of the possible . We have assumed , and rightly so , that sex education involves both facts and values . Following the principle , however , makes our task far more difficult . It is comparatively easy to teach the biological facts of life . ? It is far more difficult to deal with the complex issues of sexual morality . ? This dilemma confronts us with the formidable task of developing guiding principles in school  | sex education that take into account our crisis in sexual values and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in offering sex education , Hayman declares : We must now put our cards on the table . The central question facing us today is : sex education , for what and why and how and when ? Most parents see the need to develop family life and sex education in our schools . Yet , paradoxically , we have far too few good sex education programs in the U. S. We have even fewer parents , school administrators and school-board members , and community and church leaders who are willing and able to stand up and be counted when the anti-sexeducationalists are on the attack . Many sincere , but worried , parents have ambivalent feelings ; they are in favor of school sex education , but ? Some fear that a Swedish approach will be used , which they consider radical and dangerous . Others fear that " sex education may lead , if not push , their children toward premature sexual sophistication ; and they are reluctant to take a calculated risk " ( p. 62 ) . The Swedish sex education approach has understandingly frightened many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own children . " Sex education is mandatory in all Swedish schools from kindergarten through secondary school . Birth control education is required from age 14 on , for both sexes . Contraceptives and counseling regarding their use are readily available , without parental consent , from age  | 15 on . Moreover , VD education , including the use of preventative measures is stressed " ( p. 63 ) . Hayman believes " modern youth is in trouble and we had better heed their cry for help , before it is too late " ( p. 67 ) . He suggests that the school 's role in sex education includes such functions as : 1 . To develop two-way communication and genuine dialogue when dealing with sexual problems and issues in the classroom . 2 . To impart and discuss scientific knowledge , basic unifying concepts , and our deepest insights about human sexuality and behavior. 3 . To help youth evaluate conflicting sexual standards and value systems and to think things through , in relation to our guiding ethical principles and core values and laws in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsible value judgments and decisions and choices ; and to develop a normative ethical code that justifies their life styles and goals . 5 . To deal with sexual issues and substantive ethical systems on an objective , but not necessarily neutral , basis ; and to seek areas of agreement and common ground . 6 . To guide and counsel boys and girls in matters of sexual morality , as an integral dimension of their personality and character development . 7 . To link human sexuality ? including body , mind and spirit ? with the ultimate human goals of survival , fulfillment and significant meaning ( p. 67 ) .  | Hayman contends that even though teachers may feel threatened and defensive when handling controversial sex education problems and issues in the classroom , they should observe the following : 1 . Do n't Alienate , Communicate ; 2 . Do n't Turn Them Off , Turn Them On ; 3 . Do n't Preach , Teach ; 4 . Do n't Indoctrinate , Educate ; 5 . Do n't Dominate , Motivate ; 6 . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , But Not Necessarily Neutral ; 8 . Do n't Trivialize Health Teaching , Focus On Relevant Targets ; 9 . Do n't Focus On Imparting Facts , Focus On Changing Behavior ( pp. 67-68 ) . Certain organizations have provided useful information for developing sex education programs . For example , with the formation in 1964 , of a voluntary , nonprofit organization called the " Sex Information and Education Council of the United States ( SIECUS ) , " the sex education controversy became institutionalized . Founded by six representatives from several professions , SIECUS has acted in a consultative capacity , emphasizing the need of each community to move deliberately in implementing local sex education programs , to involve community leaders in supporting roles , to scrutinize with care all materials used in the school programs , to train competent teachers , and to construct appropriate curricula . As a result of the efforts and with the aid of SIECUS , many communities ,  | churches and school boards were able , by 1968 , to establish or improve sex instruction programs . Another valuable source of helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an up-to-date list of references following the article by Sol Gordon , " What Place Does Sex Education Have in the Schools ? " published in The Journal of School Health , April 1974 , pp. 186-189 . Dearth ( Paul B. Dearth , " Viable Sex Education in the Schools : Expectations of Students , Parents and Experts , " The Journal of School Health , April 1974 , pp. 190-193 ) in a survey posed the following fundamental questions concerning human sexuality education : Why should human sexuality education be in the schools ? When should human sexuality education in the schools begin ? Where should human sexuality education be placed in the schools ? Who should teach human sexuality education in the schools ? How should human sexuality education in the schools be taught ? What should be taught in the school human sexuality education programs ? ( p. 190 ) . These questions , as well as more specific ones , were given to students , parents , and experts to delineate specific expectations on many aspects of sex education . The author drew the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this study the student , parent , and expert groups indicated similar positive expectations of human sexuality education in the schools . The parent group showed more conservative posture on several questions , with agreement often occurring between the student and expert groups . A noticeable degree of uncertainty and undecidedness existed in all groups , particularly within the student group , Indicating the lack of clarity in many individuals ' minds regarding this area of the curriculum . However , unanimity by all three relevant groups in all areas of human sexuality education is an absolutely unrealistic expectation . These findings can provide specific data which may be helpful in making sound decisions for implementing quality human sexuality education in the schools ( p. 193 ) . In another research study ( John A. Conley and Robert S. Hoff , " The Generation Gap in Sex Education : Is There One ? " The Journal of School Health , October 1974 , pp. 428-437 ) it was indicated that , contrary to general opinion , extremely different viewpoints of parents and students on sex matters do not exist . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between grandparents and students , the differences would likely be found to be much more extreme . Presumably the parent of today is being rapidly reconciled to the modern age , including sex matters .  | In the research project referred to , the interview method was employed whereby numerous questions were asked of ninth graders , twelfth graders and their parents . The basic questions were as follows : 1 . When should family life education be taught ? 2 . Who should teach family life education ? 3 . How should family life education be taught ? 4 . Who should be taught family life education ? 5 . What should be taught when in family life education ? Obviously these basic questions led to many other questions dealing with specific matters pertaining to sex . The findings of the research were revealing in that the differences were not particularly great on most of the issues discussed . Without going into detail on the many specific issues discussed with students and parents , reference is made here to only the interpretations offered by the researchers : First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twelfth grade students , does not appear to exist to any degree that would warrant teachers and administrators being hesitant about teaching a complete family life education program in the schools from kindergarten through grade twelve . Second , parents overwhelmingly support all forty areas of instruction mentioned in this report . Further , parents usually desire earlier inclusion of a topic than do students .  | Third , the issue of separate vs. mixed classes appears to be one only in the eyes of administrators concerned with ease of scheduling rather than a parent-instigated issue . Fourth , the key to the issue of who should teach family life education appears to be more related to personality and the ability to feel at ease with the topic than to such variables as age , sex , religion , and marital status . Lastly , the authors urge others interested in separating the myths of the debate over family life education from reality to consider conducting a survey such as the one done for Champaign-Urbana for their particular locale ( p. 437 ) . A program of sex education does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as specific courses are concerned . In fact some courses would be inadequate without reference to sex in various situations . Physical education teachers certainly have a role to play in providing sexual information . A course in biology , zoology , or physiology would be virtually senseless without reference to sex . Even the English teacher finds occasion to bring the issue of sex into focus in literature courses . ( The use of certain objectionable words and phrases in literary assignments pertaining to sex has been the subject of much controversy and some litigation , which will be discussed in Chapter 4 . ) Conversely , there are certain courses which need not and should not have sexual overtones . References to sexual matters that do not have educational purposes  | should not be condoned by school administrators in any course . On this the courts are in agreement as indicated in a classic case ( State v. Board of School Directors of Milwaukee , 14 Wis. 2d 243 , 111 N.W.2d 198 1961 ) when a tenure teacher was dismissed for discussing sex with a senior class in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was considered by the school board to be improper . He ( a ) explained procedures at houses of prostitution , ( b ) explained technique of performing the sex act as if recounting personal experience , ( c ) condoned pre-marital relations , ( d ) related vulgar stories , and ( e ) treated other subjects on sex in a manner which was alleged to be improper , unnecessary and unwholesome . One more case ( In re Witschen , 238 So . 2d 123 Fla. 1970 ) is cited to illustrate the illegality of discussing sex matters improperly and unnecessarily in a manner not germane to the course of instruction . In this case a school board was upheld for dismissing a band instructor who made remarks " in the classroom of mixed boys and girls , relating to sex and virginity and premarital sex relations . " The District Court of Appeals of Florida , First District , indicated its disapproval of the leniency in such matters as shown by some of the recent federal court decisions : In addition , as to the immorality charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the petitioner in a class of mixed teenage boys and girls which we agree with the Federal Board  | were of an immoral nature . It may be that topless waitresses and entertainers are in vogue in certain areas of our country and our federal courts may try to enjoin our state courts from stopping the sale of lewd and obscene literature and the showing of obscene films , but we are still of the opinion that instructors in our schools should not be permitted to so risquely discuss sex problems in our teenage mixed classes as to cause embarrassment to the children or to invoke in them feelings not incident to the courses of study being pursued ( Id . ) . Gordon believes " a separate course for sex education is not only artificial , but is unnecessary . " He cites existing courses in psychology and human relations as examples where truths about human behavior can be understood . He states : Teenagers have questions about masturbation , homosexuality , pornography , and perversions which must be answered openly and knowledgeably . And , no course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women 's liberation and the sexism inherent in societal roles .... Adolescents have tremendous anxiety over their own emerging sexuality and as a group , are tragically misinformed . Essential facts like these will dispel myths and open up new areas of discussions : Masturbation is common and normal for adolescent girls and boys , and causes no physical or psychological harm ( provided there is no attendant guilt ) . Although few people still  | believe myths about masturbation causing aches , insanity , blindness , and impotence , new erroneous beliefs have surfaced . It would be interesting to discuss with students the reasons for these changes in attitudes toward masturbation ... . A person may have homosexual thoughts and even experiences without becoming a homosexual as an adult . Furthermore , attitudes are changing toward homosexuals .. . ( supra , p. 187 ) . Despite the seemingly valid arguments for incorporating sex education in the public schools , it still presents a perplexing and controversial issue . Although parents , school boards , and legislatures are in disagreement on the issue , the courts thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretionary authority , within state constitutional and legislative limits , in having sex education incorporated in the curriculum as they have for other elements of the curriculum . In fact the courts have expressed reluctance to rule upon cases regarding sex education , since it really is not a judicial responsibility unless a violation of the Constitution is involved . 1 . Clemmer v. U S. D. 501 , Case number 112,064 , District Court of Shawnee County ( Kansas , 1970 ) . The earliest court case on the issue arose in Topeka , Kansas , where a group called TASTE ( Trust About Sex  | Teaching in Education ) challenged a school board action that provided for a program , " Human Growth and Development " which obviously would deal with sex matters . Reference to the suit initiated by TASTE is made in Nolpe Notes , February , 1970 , as follows : Under fire is the school system 's Human Growth and Development Curriculum and its materials consisting of films , printed materials and course outlines . The suit contends teaching sex education is unconstitutional for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United States Constitution because it " destroys our personal and inalienable rights to liberty and happiness in that it is designed to question parental authority by encouraging analysis , appraisal and criticism of parental authority " ; that parents , required to send children to the public schools , have the right under this amendment to have their children taught subjects on topics which are not " repugnant to the family , " and that sex education " destroys the opportunity for the family to make its own moral and ethical value judgment on sexual behavior , sexual intercourse , premarital and extra-marital relations " ; it violates the 9th Amendment to the United States Constitution because parents have the right to regulate what is being taught in public schools ; the training is an unlawful assumption of power by the school board , because it has never been delegated by the legislature or constitution .. . the school board has abused its rights of discretion in prescribing courses of study in that sex education " vitally affects the health  | of children , the parent-child relationship , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have control over what is taught . The decision of the court was against TASTE , and in favor of the school board on the ground that the Legislature authorized school boards to conduct programs of public health , welfare and morals of the people , and that the sex education program is a reasonable exercise of this authority and does not violate the U. S. Constitution . 2 . Cornwell v. State Board of Education , 314 F. Supp. 340 ( Md. 1969 ) . Shortly following the Kansas case , a somewhat similar case was adjudicated at the U. S. District Court level , wherein a by-law of the Maryland State Board of Education was the focus of litigation . The provision of the by-law was as follows : It is the responsibility of the local school system to provide a comprehensive program of family life and sex education in every elementary and secondary school for all students as an integral part of the curriculum including a planned and sequential program of health education ( Id . at 341 ) . In response to the plaintiff 's contention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court responded thus : Assuredly it can not be said that the by-law here is an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the authority vested in the State Board to determine a teaching curriculum , nor that there is no basis in fact for the legislative  | policy expressed in the by-law . Furthermore , it does not appear that the by-law denies equal protection of the laws , as on its face it applies to all pupils equally ( Id at 342 ) . The plaintiffs further alleged that the enactment of the by-law was based on a study made in reference to pregnant pupils and was therefore defective because it applied to non-pregnant as well as to pregnant pupils . In response to this argument the court said : The plaintiff 's argument that the by-law is defective because it applies to non-pregnant as well as pregnant pupils is difficult to follow . There would appear to be just as much reason for the State Board to provide sex education for the non-pregnant ( and , incidentally , for the non-impregnating ) or for those students who , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reasons ) have become pregnant or who have caused pregnancy ( Id . at 342 ) . To the plaintiff 's further assertion that " they have the exclusive constitutional right to teach their children about sexual matters in their own homes , and that such exclusive right would prohibit the teaching of sex in the schools , " the Court replied : " No authority is cited in support of this novel proposition , and this Court knows of no such constitutional right " ( Id at 342 ) . In upholding the Board 's adoption of the sex program , the Court concluded : " The unsoundness and insubstantiality of the plaintiff 's position is clearly indicated by the various decisions of the Supreme Court to which I have alluded " ( Id . at 344 ) .  | 3 . Hopkins v. Hamden Board of Education , 289 A.2d 914 ( Conn. 1971 ) . This suit was instituted by public school children and their parents seeking a temporary injunction to restrain the State Board of Education from authorizing , and a local board of education from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education and family life ( at 914 ) . The principal objection to the curriculum was heard at a trial with parents of the Catholic religious faith . The basis for their opposition was in part , that " their religious beliefs imposed upon parents the primary obligations for education of their children and that , in the area of sexual education particularly , papal encylicals and Vatican II directed parents to instruct their children in the home in sexual matters " ( Id . at 920 ) . The court is compelled to conclude under the facts in this case that there appears to be no denial of equal protection or substantive due process or equality under the fourteenth amendment , since the course is taught to all pupils , of mixed religious beliefs , and without discrimination .... No evidence has been offered nor authority cited by the plaintiffs for their claim that the exclusive constitutional right to teach sexual matters exists only in the home and is therefore prohibited in the schools . Unless the plaintiffs claim that a secular program was a form of religion , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light most favorably to the plaintiffs , that the teaching of the curriculum will in fact establish any religious concept or philosophy in the school system ( Id . at 921-922 ) .  | In response to the plaintiffs ' allegation that the right of privacy was constitutionally violated as a result of teaching sex education as a part of the curriculum , the court responded by stating : The only evidence offered by the plaintiffs reflected their fear of disclosures by the child in the curriculum classroom discussion of private family activities or conversations which have taken place in the home . Disclosures of this nature are not constitutionally protected and do not constitute an unlawful invasion of privacy under the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution ... ( Id . at 924 ) . 4 . Valent v. New Jersey State Board of Education , 114 N.J. Super . 63 , 274 A.2d 832 ( 1971 ) . A case arose in the state of New Jersey after the State Board of Education issued a policy statement recommending that appropriate programs of sex education be developed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner of Education was directed to declare a moratorium on the Board 's policy until a legislative inquiry could be conducted . The Board attempted to quell opposition to the questioned course since it did not include " teachings and discussions on sexual intercourse , masturbation and contraception , contrary to religious beliefs of plaintiffs " ( Id . at 834 ) . The State Board refused a recommendation that " local boards of education permit students to take sex  | education courses unless a parent or guardian files a written objection with the Board of Education " ( Id . at 835 ) . The Commissioner of Education expressed the belief of the State Board that to grant " exceptions " could establish a precedent which could have a far reaching impact on the efficacy of the public school system . Parents who contested the compulsory features of the program on the grounds that it violated their constitutional rights were upheld by a trial court . The Supreme Court , however , reversed the lower court ruling on the basis of similar cases previously decided by the State Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Board of Education , 118 N.J. Super . 416 , 288 A.2d 52 1972 ) continued with an " action by parents of public school children against State Board of Education and others to challenge constitutionality of ruling requiring attendance of their children at a course entitled Human Sexuality . ' The Superior Court , Chancery Division , Stamler , J. S. C. , held that failure to exhaust administrative remedies precluded parents from maintaining such an action " ( Id . at 52-53 ) . Therefore the complaint was dismissed . 5 . Medeiros v. Kiyosaki , 478 P.2d 314 ( Hawaii 1970 ) . A case on the sex education issue went to the Supreme Court of Hawaii for settlement . The litigation began when parents of elementary school children challenged the constitutionality of showing film as part of a newly adopted program for family life and sex education . The parents wanted to know " whether parents are free to  | educate their offspring in the intimacies of sexual matters according to their own moral and religious beliefs without due interference by the State " ( Id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain parents to the showing of the films an " excusal system " was established whereby parents had the option of withholding or withdrawing their children from the Program by submitting a written excuse to the school . In order to enable parents to consider the content of the lesson they were shown on Educational Television . In holding that plaintiffs ' right of privacy was not violated the Court said : We view this " excusal system " as an effort by the defendants to allow those parents or guardians who might object to the Program or parts thereof on moral and religious grounds to have their children excused . The program was in no way compulsory , and , therefore , we can not see how the State by " unnecessarily broad means " contravened plaintiffs ' right of privacy ( Id at 317 ) . The plaintiffs ' argument that the sex education courses would burden the free " exercise of religion " of those who believed exposure to the subject is sinful , was rejected by the Court as indicated by its statement : " in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now seek a permanent injunction is not compulsory , we fail to find any direct or substantial burden on the free exercise ' of religion " ( Id . at 317-318 ) .  | 6 . Hobolth v. Green way , 52 Mich . App. 682 , 218 N.W.2d 98 ( 1974 ) . As late as 1974 , the " excusal " feature of a sex education course was again litigated in a Michigan case . The plaintiff in this case had a child enrolled in the public schools of Howell , Michigan , where sex education courses were offered and elective for eighth , ninth and tenth grade students . The plaintiff parent had filed a complaint in his own behalf and that of approximately 1200 other parents similarly situated , seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional . The law under attack was Michigan Comp . Laws Ann . Act 340 ( 1968 ) . Two of the most relevant sections of the Act follow : Sec. 789 . Sex education is the preparation for personal relationships between the sexes by providing appropriate educational opportunities designed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself and others . Sex education includes the knowledge of physical , emotional and social growth and maturation , and understanding of the individual needs . It involves an examination of man 's and woman 's roles in society , how they relate and react to supplement each other , the responsibilities of each towards the other throughout life and the development of responsible use of human sexuality as a positive and creative force . Sec. 789c . Any student upon the written request of parent or guardian shall be excused from attending classes in which the subject of sex education is under discussion and no   penalties as to credits or graduation shall result therefrom ( Id . at 99 ) . Apparently after much wrangling , with the display of exhibits and testimony , a lower court refused the contention that plaintiffs were denied substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and freedom of religion under the First Amendment . When carried to the Court of Appeals of Michigan , that court affirmed the lower court ruling , and concluded with the following remark : Neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance at such a course , if established , is compulsory . The board of education can establish the course if it wishes . If established , a student can take the course if he desires and is authorized to do so by a parent or parents . Parental authorization was one of the modifications ( Id . at 100 ) . The above-quoted remark is significant because it prevents students ' taking sex education without the knowledge or consent of parents . 7 . Preston , et al . v. Board of Education of Westfield . Decided by the Commissioner of Education of New Jersey , January 23 , 1974 . The courts are generally agreed that sex education courses are legal within legislative limitations . The litigious issue deals mostly with the compulsory aspects , which is usually resolved by an " excusal " feature of the program . The excusal provision , however , could be too complicated and relenting for judicial approval . A case in point arose in  | New Jersey when parents of pupils enrolled in the elementary grades of the Westfield Public Schools charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by proposing a Family Living-Sex Education Curriculum . The Board denied the allegation . After much consideration and debate , all issues of the proposed program were resolved by all parties concerned . The matter was then referred to the Commissioner of Education , who is authorized by law to decide educational issues arising in the State of New Jersey . The Commissioner took cognizance of the " limited excusal program " being considered by the Board which would provide : That if a parent determined that the family living program would be beneficial for the child , but felt that a particular session in the program probably would involve audiovisual material that was not in the best interest of his or her child , that the child could be excused from that one session and still take advantage of the other session ( Id . at 6 ) . It was further proposed that the " limited excusal program " should be extended to classroom discussions , so that a parent might determine in which discussions his youngster should participate . After viewing the " limited excusal program " being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  | completely untenable and without legal justification or authority . In its essence , such a policy , were it to be adopted , would give to parents the authority which the Legislature has already vested in local boards of education .... Historically , boards of education are the agencies which have the authority to determine curricula for their pupils .... These powers can neither be increased nor diminished except by the Legislature ( Id . at 8 ) . Although many sex education programs provide for an instructional unit on " birth control , " some legislatures and school patrons are vigorously opposed to having it included in the curriculum , even though instruction of other topics in physical and health education would be permissible and advocated . Mercer v. Michigan State Board of Education , 379 F. Supp. 580 ( Mich. 1974 ) , 95 U. S. 673 ( 1974 ) . For example , the legal right to teach " birth control " was the issue in a case where the state statute permitted courses to be offered in physical and health education , but with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that it is not the intention or purpose of the act to give the right of instruction in birth control and it is hereby expressly prohibited to any person to offer or give instruction in said subject of birth control or offer any advice or information with respect to said subject : Provided further , that any child upon the written request of parent or guardian shall be excused from attending classes in which the subject of sex hygiene of the  | symptoms of disease is under discussion and no penalties as to credit or graduation shall result therefrom ( Id . at 582 ) . Dr. Goldfine and Mercer ( plaintiffs in this case ) filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the state education statute quoted above . The U. S. District Court ruled , however , that neither Goldfine nor Mercer had standing to maintain this action either on their behalf or on behalf of any other person : " A litigant must show a demonstrable injury before he may be said to possess a sufficient interest in the action to entitle him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 583 ) . Mercer 's contention was in essence a question of who controls the school 's curriculum and to what extent . The Court admitted the undoubted right of the State to establish the curriculum , but cautioned that " the right of the State is not absolute .... It is the duty of this court to sift the law and the facts and determine whether or not the State overstepped its boundaries in prohibiting the teaching of birth control " ( Id . at 585 ) . Whether or not the State overstepped its legal boundaries , in this instance , the Court upheld the dismissal of the motion of the plaintiffs , and supported its decision with the following rationale : The thrust of this suit is to obtain an abstract determination of the invalidity of the statute on its face at a time when there are no concrete problems before the court . No one is charged with violating the act . This is exactly the kind of case in which a declaration of invalidity of certain application would not be appropriate .  | The statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any , will come from its application . A plaintiff will not be heard to attack a Constitutional statute on the ground it might some day be applied to him in an unconstitutional manner .... There is no indication there have been efforts to apply improperly the statute or that its application is causing any problems in connection with attempting to teach matters directed and authorized by the state .... The court should wait until someone is alleged to have violated the statute and there are facts , as cold and hard as concrete instead of hypothetical , before attempting to write the outer limits of constitutional authority in the area ( Id . at 587 ) . On appeal , this case was taken to the United States Supreme Court where , on December 23 , 1974 , the judgment of the lower court was promptly upheld . Therefore : " Michigan 's statutory prohibitions against teaching of birth control in public schools does not infringe upon First Amendment right of public school teachers . Judgment affirmed " ( The United States Law Week , December 24 , 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school board has a legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of the schools by protecting against potentially-detrimental influences on impressionable pupils who may be affected by the conduct of their teachers outside the classroom . This assumption is shared by school patrons as well as the courts . Therefore , questionable sexual behavior of teachers is scrutinized by the judiciary more closely than it is for persons outside the teaching profession . Briefly , " homosexuality " may be defined as sexual desire or behavior directed toward a person or persons of one 's own sex . It has been in existence since the beginning of mankind and the subject of divergent views for centuries . In recent decades it has also become an issue for litigation ? particularly as applied to school teachers . It would be difficult to estimate the number of persons entering the teaching profession who are or have been homosexuals , even in states where teacher certification is based upon moral character . Of course  | it would also be difficult to prove that one is immoral merely because of homosexual tendencies . Nevertheless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being immoral and unprofessional and therefore a legitimate cause for teacher dismissal . 1 . Morrison v. State Board of Education , 74 Cal . Rptr. 116 ( 1969 ) . In a 1969 California case , it was reported and confirmed that a teacher engaged in certain homosexual acts with a fellow teacher , a married man . The involved teacher petitioned for a writ of mandamus to prevent the State Board of Education from revoking his life diploma to teach children because of his homosexual act . A superior court admitted the act did not constitute a crime under California law , but held that the teacher 's homosexual conduct was immoral and unprofessional , within the Education Code , which authorized revocation of the teacher 's certificate . On appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court . The Court said , in part : There is no direct evidence that the acts complained of or the homosexual character of petitioner did in any manner affect petitioner 's capacity , ability and willingness to perform in a satisfactory manner as a teacher or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In our view , the lack of such evidence is not significant . The School Board has a legitimate interest in maintaining the integrity of the schools and protecting against potential influences on impressionable pupils who may  | be affected by the conduct of its teacher outside the classroom ( Id . at 118 ) . In affirming the judgment of the lower court , the Court of Appeals reasoned as follows : We do not have before us the question of whether a homosexual is more dangerous to children than a heterosexual . We decide only that conduct of one or the other found to be immoral within the meaning of the code section is sufficient ground for discharge ( Id . at 120 ) . On further appeal , the Supreme Court of California reversed the judgments of the lower courts ( 82 Cal . Rep. 175 ) . After reviewing many court cases dealing with immorality and fitness to teach , the Supreme Court stated : We can not believe the Legislature intended to compel disciplinary measures against teachers who committed such peccadillos if such passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents of extramarital heterosexual conduct against a background of years of satisfactory teachinT would not constitute " immoral conduct ' sufficient to justify revocation of a life diploma without any showing of an adverse effect on fitness to teach ( Id . at 183 ) . 2 . Burton v. Cascade School District Union High School No. 5 , 353 F. Supp. 254 ( Ore . 1973 ) . In an Oregon case a teacher successfully sought relief from an action of the Cascade School Board which dismissed her from  | her teaching position in the high school on the grounds that she was a homosexual . It was not until the involved teacher had commenced her second year of teaching that the principal of the school learned from the mother of a student that the teacher was a homosexual . Although the teacher confessed she was a practicing homosexual there was no allegation that she was " derelict in her teaching duties or that she made advances toward any student . " The Cascade School Board sought support for its action from a state statute which authorized dismissal of teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States District Court Judge , however , the statute was too vague as to classify homosexuality as being immoral , as evidenced by his following statement : This statute vests in the school board the power to dismiss teachers for immorality . However , the statute does not define immorality . Immorality means different things to different people , and its definition depends on the idiosyncracies of the individual school board members . It may be applied so broadly that every teacher in the state could be subject to discipline . The potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is inherent in such a statute . A statute so broad makes those charged with its enforcement the arbiters of morality for the entire community . In doing so , it subjects the livelihood of every teacher in the state to the irrationality and irregularity of such judgments . The statute is vague because it fails to give fair warning of what conduct is  | prohibited and because it permits erratic and prejudiced exercises of authority ( Id . at 255 ) . 3 . Acanfora v. Board of Education of Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Maryland case which was widely publicized was first taken to a United States District Court and later to a United States Court of Appeals ( Fourth Circuit ) for a ruling . The case involved a junior high school teacher who admittedly was a homosexual , and who was transferred by the Montgomery County deputy superintendent to administrative work where presumably his sexual background would not have such a detrimental influence on young pupils . When the school officials did not accede to Acanfora 's demands that he be returned to his classroom assignment , he began action under the Civil Rights Act . At this stage of the litigation the mass media stepped into the picture to publicize the case . At the invitation of the Public Broadcasting System , Acanfora appeared with his parents on a program designed to help parents and homosexual children cope with the problems that confront them . Acanfora also consented to other television , radio , and press interviews . The transcripts of the television programs , which the district court found to be typical of all the interviews , disclose that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not advocate homosexuality , he sought community acceptance . He also stressed that he had not , and would not ,  | discuss his sexuality with the students ( Id . at 500 ) . The court was assured that the publicity provided by the media did not disrupt the school nor impair the capacity of the teachers , and held , therefore , that " Acanfora 's public statements were protected by the first amendment and that they do not justify either the action taken by the school system or the dismissal of his suit " ( Id . at 501 ) . The court , however , did rule against Acanfora on a different count . It had been revealed that on his application for the teaching position he did not reveal his membership in a homosexual organization while a student at Penn State . The court believed the omission of the information was not inadvertent but significant and that Acanfora omitted it because " he believed disclosure would foreclose his opportunity to be considered for employment on an equal basis with other applicants " ( Id @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information , in the eyes of the court , was sufficient to uphold the action of the school officials , as indicated by the court 's concluding statement : Acanfora purposely misled the school officials so he could circumvent , not challenge , what he considers to be their unconstitutional employment practices . He can not now invoke the process of the court to obtain a ruling on an issue that he practiced deception to avoid ( Id . at 504 ) .  | 4 . Gish v. Board of Education of the Borough of Paramus ( Decision of the New Jersey Commissioner of Education , dated December 2 , 1974 ) . In this case it was revealed that a high-school teacher assumed the office of president of the Gay Activist Alliance of New Jersey , an organization dedicated to the elimination of discrimination against gay persons , including homosexuals . Despite the Board 's disapproval of the teacher 's affiliations and reputation , he continued to make public his advocacy to promote the activist cause . He even went so far as to suggest " it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gay Club . " The Board was convinced that the teacher 's behavior deviated from the mental health necessary for association with the children under his control , whereupon the Board ordered that Gish be required to undergo a psychiatric examination . The teacher refused to undergo the examination as ordered by the Board , but instead , submitted " a Motion for a Summary Judgment " which was denied by the Commissioner of Education , who ordered the teacher " to submit to a psychiatric examination in accordance with New Jersey laws and the Board 's directive " ( Id . at 36 ) . Not many cases are reported by the courts of record which deal specifically with adultery committed by teachers according to the dictionary definition of " adultery " : " voluntary sexual intercourse between a  | married person and someone other than her or his lawful spouse . " 1 . Erb v. Iowa State Board of Public Instruction , 216 N.W.2d 339 ( Iowa 1974 ) . This case definitely falls in the area of adultery . It concerns the question as to whether Erb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the allegation of moral unfitness to teach . Erb 's background , as reported in the case report , indicates he was a military veteran , holder of a master 's degree in fine arts , possessor of a teaching certificate , taught art , coached wrestling , assisted with football , and acted as senior class sponsor . Witnesses testified that he was highly successful in all these activities . A complaint was made against Erb by a farmer ( Johnson ) whose wife taught home economics in the same school , on the ground that she and Erb were engaging in adulterous affairs , which was suspicioned by the frequent late-night absences from home by the " farmer 's wife . " Johnson 's suspicions were substantiated by the observations he made , as described in the case report : He suspected Margaret and Erb were meeting secretly and engaging in illicit activity in the Johnson automobile . One night in May he hid in the trunk of the car . Margaret drove the car to school , worked there for some time , and later drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Margaret and Erb had sexual intercourse in the back seat of the car while Johnson remained hidden in the trunk ... ( Id . at 341 ) .  | On the basis of this admitted evidence Johnson told the board his goal was removal of Erb from the school and not revocation of his teaching certificate . Nevertheless the board voted five to four to revoke Erb 's certificate and the " trial court held Erb 's admitted adulterous conduct was sufficient basis for revocation of his certificate " . . . ( Id . at 342 ) . The Supreme Court of Iowa , however , ruled that " the board acted illegally in revoking the certificate and supported its decision on other court decisions which ruled that conduct must adversely affect the teacherstudent relationship before revocation will be approved . " There was no evidence of such adverse effect in the present case . In a concluding statement the Supreme Court supported Erb with the following words : The evidence showed Erb to be a teacher of exceptional merit . He is dedicated , hardworking and effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson had or is likely to have an adverse effect upon his relationship with the school administration , fellow teachers , the student body or the community .... The conduct itself was not an open or public affront to community mores ; it became public only because it was discovered with considerable effort and made public by others ( Id . at 344 ) . 2 . Denton v. South Kitsap School District No. 402 , 516 P.2d 1080 ( Wash . 1973 ) . This case does not  | necessarily fit into a category of adulterous acts as adultery is defined . It does , however , refer to a situation of sexual intercourse under illegal circumstances . The records of the hearing and trial of the case disclose the following course of events : Mr. Denton , a teacher at Marcus Whitman Junior High School , became acquainted with a girl who was a student at South Kitsap High School , as a result of his friendship with her parents . Although she had been a student at the junior high school during Mr. Denton 's tenure there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission from her parents to date her , and they dated during the summer and fall of 1971 ( Id . at 1081 ) . Somewhat later the school administrators received information that the student in question was pregnant . At a school board hearing Denton admitted that the student was pregnant and that he was the expectant father . Consequently he was discharged and Mr. Denton appealed the discharge to a superior court . The case later went to the Court of Appeals of Washington . Although the statute providing for discharge of teachers had seldom been elucidated in Washington cases , the Court of Appeals contended : Nonetheless , we believe that the behavior of the appellant in this case is well within its purview . Indeed it is difficult to conceive of circumstances which would more justify the action of the school board than the sexual misconduct of a teacher with a minor student in the district ( Id . at 1081 ) .  | Denton argued that his admission that he was guilty of the acts charged was inadmissible because they were " obtained by implied coercion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments for retention of his teaching position he relied heavily on the case of Morrison v. State Board of Education , supra , that " discharge of a teacher can not be predicated upon sexual immorality absent a showing that the conduct rebounds adversely upon the teacher 's fitness to teach " ( Id . at 1082 ) . The court found Mr. Denton 's contentions to be without merit and ruled that : In our view , the school board may properly conclude in such a situation that the conduct is inherently harmful to the teacher-student relations , and thus to the school district . We are accordingly of the opinion that Mr. Denton 's conduct constituted sufficient cause for discharge ( Id at 1082 ) . 3 . Board of Trustees of Compton Junior College District v. Stubblefield , 16 Cal . App. 3d 820 , 94 Cal . Rptr. 318 ( 1971 ) . In this case a board of trustees suspended a teacher from his employment on charges for immoral conduct as provided in the Education Code . More specifically the charges as reported by the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove a female student , and member of that class , in his car to a location on a side street near Compton College and parked . The location is in an area of industrial construction and was not lighted .  | At some time after defendant parked , a Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff spotted defendant 's car . The car appeared to the deputy to be abandoned and he went to investigate .... When the deputy approached defendant 's car , illuminating the interior with the flashlight , he observed ... ( Id at 320 ) a situation which indicated the act of sexual intercourse . Moreover , the defendant who was caught in a state of undress assaulted the policeman and attempted to escape . After finding the charges against the defendant to be true the court decided that they constituted a sufficient basis for the board 's dismissal of the teacher . In support of its ruling , the court referred to a number of earlier cases in which it was pointed out that : There are certain professions which impose upon persons attracted to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in regard to other callings . Public officials such as judges , policemen and school teachers fall into such a category ( Id . at 321 ) . In conclusion the Court of Appeals reasoned that : unfitness to teach in terms of an indication that defendant was more likely than the average adult male to engage in any untoward conduct with a student can be inferred from the very conduct itself . Defendant 's actions in this case speak louder than any words of a psychiatrist . The potential , evidence of which was found lacking in Morrison , was overtly manifested here ( Id . at 323 ) .  | 4 . Fisher v. Snyder , 346 F. Supp. 396 ( Neb. 1972 ) . Mere suspicion of sexual misconduct is not justification for termination of a teacher 's contract . A case in point arose in Nebraska where a divorcee who taught in a high school was known to have young men stay in her single bedroom apartment over nights . An Avon lady testified that she visited and apparently got the teacher out of bed early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedroom . On the basis of such testimony , the board acted to dismiss her for conduct " unbecoming a teacher . " A United States District Court held that the flimsy evidence produced did not justify sufficient cause for terminating the teacher 's contract . The court 's reasoning is evidenced in the following statements : When viewed most favorably from the position of the board of education and taking every permissible inference from the testimony elicited at the hearing , there is simply no proof of impropriety in Mrs. Fisher 's conduct which affected her classroom performance , her relationship with students under her care , or otherwise had any bearing on any interest possessed by the board of education . At most , the evidence may be said to raise a question of Mrs. Fisher 's good judgment in her personal affairs , when measured against an undefined standard which someone could suppose exists in a small town in Nebraska . I am constrained to hold that that was not enough to justify termination of the contract ( Id . at 398 ) .  | Her effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factual challenge . It is the lack of any factual , as contrasted with imagined or theoretical connection between Mrs. Fisher 's association and a substantial weakening of the educational enterprise conducted by the board of education that must result in a finding that the termination of the contract was not constitutionally justified ( Id . at 401 ) . 5 . Goldin v. Board of Education of Central School District No. 1 , 359 N.Y.S.2d 384 ( 1973 ) . Another case which had certain elements similar to those of the Fisher v. Snyder case just cited is also in point . In the instant case , charges were made against Gary Goldin ( unmarried ) , Guidance Counsellor , for having slept with an 18-year-old female , a member of the graduating class . The affair took place after graduation , at which time the girl was no longer a student . Since the female was no longer a student of Goldin , the teacher-pupil relationship did not exist . Therefore the court ruled : A different case would be presented if the specifications indicated an abuse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern is with pupils in its care but this case lacks allegation or evidence that the welfare of any pupil has been impaired or prejudiced while she was a pupil . The private association of a teacher with a member of the opposite sex is not by itself the concern of the defendant except on a showing not here made  | that it may interfere with his responsibilities to his students and his ability to teach ( Id . at 386 ) . 6 . In the Matter of the Tenure Hearing of Anthony Polito . Decision of N. J. Commissioner of Education , issued June 25 , 1974 . Charges alleging conduct unbecoming a teacher , when made by a young student , should be scrutinized with extreme caution . In this case a board of education suspended a vocal music teacher from his teaching duties pending the validity of charges made by a 13-year-old female pupil . The board certified written charges that the teacher made improper advances of sexual conduct with the pupil . The use of a polygraph test in connection with the charges was held inadmissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing examiner who found " no basis to disbelieve respondent 's calm , straightforward denial of the accusations herein . While respondent , by his own admission , may have used poor judgment regarding his scheduling of individual practice sessions for female pupils , particularly those of such an impressionable age . . . " ( Id . at 20 ) . The Acting Commissioner of Education found : In essence , the charges herein against respondent are grounded in the unsupported testimony of a pupil thirteen years of age , and they are denied by respondent . However , in many previous decisions the Commissioner expressed the opinion that the testimony of school pupils must be used with great caution and particularly where , as here , such use  | requires a final adjudication grounded primarily on the basis of the testimony ( Id . at 22 ) . The Commissioner accordingly directed the Board " to restore respondent to his position of employment forthwith with all the emoluments which are due him , retroactive to the date of the suspension by the Board . " 1 . Governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cal . App. 3d 546 , 111 Cal . Rptr. 724 ( 1974 ) . It appears that " oral copulation " is an offense largely restricted to the state of California . At least the frequency of court cases reported on that issue seem to substantiate that speculation . In the instant case Metcalf , a sixth grade probationary teacher , was convicted of engaging in an act of prostitution ( lewd act between persons for money or other consideration ) . More specifically , he was found to be engaged in an act of oral copulation in a doorless toilet stall in a public restroom in a downtown department store . Upon his resulting dismissal from his teaching position , Metcalf contended that the evidence had been obtained by police in violation of Federal and state constitutions and was therefore not admissible . The Supreme Court , however , held that under the Education Code , the governing board had sufficient cause to place the teacher on compulsory leave of absence and thereafter to dismiss him on grounds of  | immoral conduct and evident unfitness for service as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals . That court , realizing that " a teacher in the public schools is regarded by his pupils as an examplar whose words and conduct are apt to be emulated by his pupils , " emphasized that " it was the principal 's professional opinion that if the incident ever became known to Metcalf 's fellow teachers , his pupils or to parents of those pupils , Metcalf would have been unable to function effectively thereafter as a teacher and his exemplar image would have been destroyed " ( Id . at 727 ) . The court shared the professional opinion of the school principal and upheld the board 's dismissal of the teacher . 2 . Pettit v. State Board of Education , 10 Cal . App. 3d 29 , 109 Cal . Rptr. 665 ( 1973 ) . This case involved an elementary school teacher whose life diploma had been revoked because of her engagement in " certain acts of sexual misconduct evidencing her unfitness to teach . " Although the plaintiff teacher did not testify at the hearing , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " The Swingers , " a private club in Los Angeles , evidently devoted primarily to promoting diverse sexual activities between members of the party . He also testified that he and his wife appeared on television shows and discussed " nonconventional sexual life styles . " He recalled the subjects of adultery and " wife swapping " ? expressing their philosophic attitude as not being " uptight " about them .  | After considerable testimony the hearing examiner found that plaintiff has engaged in acts of sexual intercourse and oral copulation with men other than her husband ; that .. . although plaintiff 's services as a teacher have been " satisfactory , " and although she is unlikely to repeat the sexual misconduct , nevertheless she has engaged in immoral and unprofessional conduct , in acts involving moral turpitude , and in acts evidencing her unfitness for service . Accordingly , the hearing examiner concluded that cause exists for revocation of her life diploma . The board adopted the findings and conclusions of its hearing officers in toto ( Id . at 667 ) . The Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher 's dismissal and concluded with the following declaration : A teacher in the public school system is regarded by the public and pupils in the light of an exemplar , whose words and actions are likely to be followed by the children coming under her care and protection . In the instant case , the board and trial court were entitled to conclude , on the basis of the expert testimony set forth above and the very nature of the misconduct involved , that Mrs. Pettit 's illicit and indiscreet actions disclosed her unfitness to teach in public elementary schools ( Id . at 670 ) . That the majority opinion does not bring finality to cases of this nature is evidenced by a statement of a dissenting judge in this case :  | I submit that the majority opinion is blind to the reality of sexual behavior . Its view that teachers in their private lives should exemplify Victorian principles of sexual morality , and in the classroom should subliminally indoctrinate the pupils in such principles , is hopelessly unrealistic and atavistic . The children of California are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case , such a teacher is forced to abandon her lifetime profession , the children are the losers ( Id . at 675 ) . 3 . Board of Education of El Monte School District v. Calderon , 35 Cal . App. 3d 492 , 110 Cal . Rptr. 916 ( 1974 ) . Just one year after the Pettit case , another case was brought to the California courts on the same issue of oral copulation . Here a probationary certified male teacher had been charged with having engaged in an act of oral copulation with another man for which a criminal complaint charged him with violation of a section of the Penal Code . The defendant teacher was acquitted by a superior court of the criminal charge so he demanded reinstatement and payment of back salary . Under California law , however , a board of education is not precluded from discharging a teacher for a sex offense despite his acquittal of a criminal charge . The Court of Appeals denied a rehearing of the case and abided by the findings of the trial court : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by plaintiff Board ; this conduct was indicative of corruption ,  | indecency , depravity , dissoluteness , and shamelessness , showing moral indifference to opinions of respectable members of the community and an inconsiderate attitude toward good order and public welfare , and was discussed at Board meetings attended by teachers and interested parents within the community . It concluded that the defendant 's conduct is immoral conduct and he is not entitled to recover any back salary ( Id . at 918 ) .. In supporting its stand , the court stated : We reasonably assume , therefore , that our Legislature properly intended by the ; enactment of the pertinent sections of they Education Code to permit school boards to shield children of tender years from the possible detrimental influence of teachers who commit acts described therein even though they are not found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .... Finally , the criminal charge between the defendant and the State was penal in nature while the case between defendant and the Board is remedial , for the protection of i young children ( Id . at 920-921 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 13 , 316 A.2d 39 ( 1974 ) . " Transsexualism " has been an issue of discussion and controversy , especially during the last decade . Never before , however , has it been a litigious issue involving a school teacher until an applicable case arose in New Jersey in 1974 . The thrust of the issue in the instant case was whether a male tenured teacher who underwent sexreassignment surgery to change his external anatomy  | to that of a female could be dismissed from his teaching position on the ground that his retention would result in harm to the students . The background of the case is so clearly stated in the case report that it is quoted here : Paul Monroe Grossman , now 54 years of age , married , and the father of three children , was engaged as a teacher by the Bernards Township Board of Education in 1957 and received tenure in 1960 . He taught vocal music in one of the elementary schools , primarily to fourth , fifth and sixth grade children between the ages of 10 and 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which worsened with the passage of time until , shortly after his fiftieth birthday , he sought medical advice , commenced a course of treatment , and , in March 1971 , had sex-reassignment surgery performed . He had been diagnosed as a transsexual ; that is , one who anatomically is born with the genitalia of one sex but who believes himself ( or herself ) to be a member of the other sex . Although Grossman had notified his superiors of his impending absence for surgery , he did not disclose its nature until his return in late April or May of 1971 , when he informed the township superintendent of schools and made known his intention of remaining in the school system as a female . After completing the academic year in male attire , he assumed the name of Paula Miriam Grossman and began to live openly as a woman .  | During the summer of that year the matter was under active and continuous consideration by the board , looking toward a satisfactory resolution of the problem . A series of meetings took place between it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female gender henceforth ) , arrangements were made for her to be examined by board selected psychiatrists , and finally a proposal was submitted by the board to engage her on a one-year contract at the same pay to teach the same courses , but only on an elective basis in the high school , provided she would resign , thus relinquishing her tenure , and obtain a new certificate in her female name . The offer was rejected ( Id . at 42 ) . The Commissioner of Education and other school officials heard much testimony and many opinions from professional personnel ? some of which was conflicting . They had to decide if the sex-reassignment surgery could have a detrimental impact upon the students of the teacher . After reviewing the conflicting evidence on the issue , the Commissioner finally reached " his conclusion that Mrs. Grossman 's presence in the classroom could potentially result in psychological harm to students " ( Id at 45 ) . In support of the Commissioner 's ruling for dismissal of Mrs. Grossman , the Superior Court of New Jersey reasoned as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher 's fitness solely on his or her ability to perform the teaching function and to ignore the fact that the teacher 's presence in the classroom might , nevertheless , pose a danger  | of harm to the students for a reason not related to academic proficiency . We are convinced that where , as has been found in this case , a teacher 's presence in the classroom would create a potential for psychological harm to the students , the teacher is unable properly to fulfill his or her role and his or her incapacity has been established within the purview of the statute . In fairness to Mrs. Grossman , we emphasize that the Commissioner 's conclusions relate only to her fitness to continue teaching in the Bernards Township school system . We express no opinion with respect to her fitness to teach elsewhere and under circumstances different from those revealed in the present case ( Id at 49 ) . 5 . Wishart v. McDonald , 367 F. Supp. 530 ( Mass. 1973 ) . A most unusual case was adjudicated in Massachusetts where a 43-year-old male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was dismissed for public " conduct unbecoming a teacher by displaying and fondling in public view a dress mannequin . " He was told that although he was being dismissed as a teacher , his compensation was not being terminated , and arrangements could be made for nonteaching duties . This was not agreeable to the dismissed teacher and he sought declaratory and injunctive relief , as well as monetary damages arising out of his dismissal . Such relief was denied by a United States District Court in Massachusetts . The charge for conduct unbecoming a teacher consisted of the following actions :  | ( a ) That you have on various occasions displayed and carried a dress mannequin in the public view on your Spooner Street property , have dressed said mannequin in feminine attire , and have on occasion caressed said mannequin. ( b ) That your actions in the public view on your Spooner Street property in regard to the dressing and undressing of said dress mannequin in feminine attire have been on various occasions of a suggestive or lewd nature ( Id . at 532 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had all observed the conduct taking place . Their testimony was approximately the same as to what they each observed . One neighbor lived next door and the other couple lived across the street . They all testified they had seen plaintiff caress the object in the area of the breast on occasion . There was some uncertainty as to whether or not some simulated legs had been suspended from the object and as to what type of dress or nightgown was used . They had each observed the conduct the night the object was brought to the front of the house and placed on the top of plaintiff 's car which was parked in the street . Two witnesses testified they observed plaintiff engaging in what they interpreted to be a form of masturbation . There was no testimony that he at any time exposed himself . At least one neighbor testified the area was well lit . This incident took place very late in the evening and appears to have been the most open and most  | suggestive conduct which any of the neighbors had observed plaintiff engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying the charges , the plaintiff teacher argued that the evidence indicates " his conduct in no way relates to his ability to function as a teacher and that to dismiss him for this unrelated conduct was impermissible . " In fact , witnesses rated him as an above-average or even an " excellent " teacher . The court concluded that , on the basis of evidence presented , the school committee had not " acted arbitrarily or capriciously in its action . " Moreover , the plaintiff 's contention that he was deprived of his constitutional right of privacy was denied , as indicated in the following statement of the court : The court is not impressed by plaintiff 's argument that the defendant 's actions constituted an unconstitutional invasion of his right to privacy . However convincing his argument may be that private sexual conduct is protected from governmental intrusion , the evidence in this case is ample that on various occasions the conduct was public in nature or at least was carried on with such reckless disregard of whether or not he was observed that it lost whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 535 ) .  | Briefly , " obscenity " is defined in Black 's Law Dictionary as " the character or quality of being obscene : conduct tending to corrupt the public morale by indecency . " In more length , " obscene " is defined as : " Offensive to chastity of mind or to modesty , expressing or presenting to the mind or view something that delicacy , purity , and decency forbid to be exposed ; calculated to corrupt , deprave and debauch the morale of people , and promote violation of law ; licentious and libidinous and tending to excite feelings of an impure or unchaste character , tending to stir the sex impulses or to lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts , tending to corrupt the morale of youth or to lower the standards of right and wrong especially as to sexual relations " ( Id . at 1227 ) . Oakland Unified School District of Alameda County v. Olicker , 25 Cal . App. 3d 1098 , 102 Cal . Rptr. 421 ( 1972 ) . In this case which was packed with obscenities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " obscene " in these words :  | " Obscene " means that to the average person , applying contemporary standards , the predominant appeal of the matter , taken as a whole is to the prurient interest , i.e. , a shameful or morbid interest in nudity , sex , or excretion , which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters and is matter which is utterly without redeeming social importance ( Id . at 433 ) . Also in a much publicized case ( Ginzburg v. United States , 383 U.S. 463 1966 ) Justice Brennan discusses three elements which a majority of the court seems to consider material in proving obscenity : The first element considered necessary for determining obscenity is that the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole must appeal to the prurient interest in sex ( Id . at 478 ) . The second element for determining obscenity is that the material must be patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters ... ( Id . at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish obscenity is that the material must be utterly without redeeming social value ... ( Id . at 480 ) . In virtually all the obscenity cases carried to the United States Supreme Court , the court 's accepted definitions of obscenity are strikingly similar . The brief  | statement in Miller v. California , 413 U.S. 15 ( 1973 ) , is typical : T basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be : ( a ) whether " the average person , applying contemporary community standards " would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest ; ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literacy , artistic , political , or scientific value ( Id . at 24 ) . The hazards and responsibilities of the English teacher are especially great in the selection and use of allegedly obscene materials and ideas subject to controversy and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a publication ( National Council of Teachers of English , " Obscenity , the Law and the English Teacher . " Champaign , Ill. 1966 ) : Teachers of English share with others a concern lest the free exchange of ideas in schools and colleges , no less than in American society as a whole , be restricted by irresponsible efforts to limit access to controversial books . They share with parents an obligation to help young people cope with ideas , distinguish the valid from the invalid , develop standards for discrimination . And they share the responsibility of introducing these  | readers to some of the great literary works of American culture , many of which present controversial ideas and images with all the richness and powers of language that the great artist can command . The task of the English teacher is not an easy one and the responsibilities are great . Many English teachers fear the possibility of losing their positions by exercising their academic freedom in the selection of texts and other written materials which contain words and phrases offensive and objectionable to certain school patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter of a publication , edited by Mark M. Krug ( " The Teaching of English in the Decade Ahead , " F. E. Peacock Publishers . Ithaca , Ill. 1972 ) : Many teachers throw up their hands and either leave the profession or settle down to teach only the vapid , innocuous works which will offend no one , and which will certainly inspire few students ever to read for pleasure . The same concern for teachers of English who choose to exercise their academic freedom is expressed in a 1974 publication ( Stephen N. Judy , Explorations in the Teaching of Secondary English . Dodd Mead and Co. , New York , 1974 ) : the society that canonizes reading is equally afraid of print and literate people . The same parents who are withdrawing their support from the schools because of failures to teach basic reading skills are increasingly trying to play the role of censor for the Enghsh  | teacher . Parents continue to be afraid ? in rather vague ways ? of the possible effects of " dirty " or " subversive " books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more lively , contemporary literature into his classes often does so at the risk of losing his job ( p. 116 ) . The potentiality of losing a teaching position in selecting material for reading is expressed in an emotionally written article ( Elizabeth Gates Whaley , " What Happens When you Put the Manchild in the Promised Land , " English Journal , vol. 63 , No. 5 May , 1974 ) by a teacher who tells how and why she lost her position ? culminating from her reading syllabus for a junior-senior mini-course , " Black Literature . " The particular book in question was Claude Brown 's Manchild in the Promised Land , which turned out to be a bombshell in the small community because of sexual overtones . After receiving undue criticism and abuse for her choice of reading materials , the writer makes the following statement as a record of what took place : I chose Manchild in the Promised Land by Claude Brown as the finest example of contemporary life in the Harlem ghetto and I stand solidly behind the choice ... : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy and rotten " does not impress me . I think these people may all be fine persons , but they are not aware evidently of what good literature is . But more pertinent perhaps than that , they are not aware of what today 's high  | school student is like ? how he perceives his own world , the world about him , and how maturely he is able to read about and discuss a multiplicity of contemporary problems . Thus I am deeply disappointed not only in the failure of these people to see any good in Manchild , but in their persistence and insistence in banning the book . They have become censors and book banners ( pp. 63-64 ) . One may speculate that had this incident ? similar to many others ? been carried to the courts , the final outcome of the school board 's action might have been in favor of the dismissed teacher . The great majority of court cases dealing with obscenities in teaching evolve from the use of the " fourlettered word " meaning sexual intercourse . When teachers assign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members may take action by dismissal with potential litigation to follow . 1 . Keefe v. Geanakos , 418 F.2d 359 ( 1st Cir. 1969 ) . Undoubtedly many of the cases are settled in the lower courts , although some have gone before a court of record . The first such case originating in Massachusetts dealt with a teacher 's constitutional right to teach subject matter which to some might seem obscene . The facts of the case indicate that a tenured teacher , who was head of the English department , gave to each member of his senior English class a copy of a  | " controversial " article , " The Young and the Old " written by a psychiatrist and professor at a noted medical school . The plaintiff teacher then : discussed the article , and a particular word that was used therein , and explained the word 's origin and context , and the reasons the author had included it . The word , admittedly highly offensive , is a vulgar term for an incestuous son . Plaintiff stated that any student who felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaintiff was called to a meeting of the school committee and asked to defend his use of the offending word .... and to agree not to use it again in the classroom . Plaintiff replied that he could not , in good conscience , agree ( Id . at 361 ) . Consequently the teacher was suspended with the proposal that he be discharged . The United States Court of Appeals , First Circuit , decided in favor of the teacher , and made the following statement in support of its decision : The Lifton article , which we have read in its entirety , has been described as a valuable discussion of " dissent , protest , radicalism and revolt . " It is in no sense pornographic . We need no supporting affidavits to find it scholarly , thoughtful and thought-provoking . The single offending word , although repeated a number of times , is not artificially introduced , but , on the contrary , is important to the development of the thesis and the conclusions of the author . . . . It is not possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , as an incitement to libidinous conduct , or even thoughts . If it raised the concept of incest , it was not to suggest it , but to condemn it ; the word was used , by the persons described , as a superlative of opprobrium . We believe not only that the article negatived any other concept , but that an understanding of it would reject , rather than suggest , the word 's use . With regard to the word itself , we can not think that it is unknown to many students in the last year of high school , and we might well take judicial notice of its use by young radicals and protesters from coast to coast ... . Hence the question in this case is whether a teacher may , for demonstrated educational purposes , quote a " dirty " word currently used in order to give special offense , or whether the shock is too great for high school seniors to stand . If the answer were that the students must be protected from such exposure , we would fear for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defendants in believing that some parents have been offended . With the greatest respect to such parents , their sensibilities are not the full measure of what is proper education ( Id at 361-362 ) . 2 . Parducci Rutland , 316 F. Supp. 352 ( Ala. 1970 ) . The issue of sexual obscenity in literature was again litigated in the state of Alabama . The case was decided by a United States District Court . The controversy involved in this case arose because of an assignment , as outside reading in an English class , of a story entitled " Welcome to the Monkey House " which was a comic  | satire written by a prominent author . It was chosen by the teacher to explain " one particular genre of western literature . " The principal and associate superintendent ( both of whom admitted they had no expertise in the field of literature , or had even taught an English course ) expressed their displeasure with the content of the story and described it as " literary garbage " because it allegedly condoned " the killing off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the school administrators ' complaints , the School Board notified the teacher that she had been dismissed from her job for assigning materials which had a " disruptive effect on the school " and refusing the counselling and advice of the school principal . The ensuing litigation revealed that the plaintiff teacher asserted in her complaint that her dismissal for assigning the controversial reading violated her First Amendment right to academic freedom . Although the court did not agree that academic freedom was one of the enumerated rights of the First Amendment , it did emphasize that " the right to teach , to inquire , to evaluate and to study is fundamental to a democratic society " ( Id at 355 ) . In its ruling the court declared : Since the defendants have failed to show either that the assignment was inappropriate reading for high school juniors , or that it created a significant disruption to the educational processes of the school , this court concludes that plaintiff 's dismissal constituted  | an unwarranted invasion of the First Amendment right to academic freedom ( Id . at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the absence of standards involved in the instant case , the court continued : When a teacher is forced to speculate as to what conduct is permissible and what conduct is proscribed , he is apt to be overly cautious and reserved in the classroom . Such a reluctance on the part of the teacher to investigate and experiment with new and different ideas is anathema to the entire concept of academic freedom ( Id . at 357 ) . The court ruled that " the plaintiff be reinstated as a teacher for the duration of her contract , with the same rights and privileges which attached to her status prior to her illegal suspension " ( Id . at 358 ) . 3 . Mailloux v. Kiley , 323 F. Supp. 1387 ( Mass. 1971 ) . The issue of using the " four-lettered word " was litigated again in a federal case when a U. S. District Court upheld a teacher 's action against a school board which discharged him for writing a slang word for sexual intercourse on the blackboard , and in discussing such word as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teacher involved in this case attempted to dispel antiquated teaching methods . He criticized practices in a rural Kentucky school where the class had been divided with boys on one side and the girls on the other side of the room . He then proceeded  | to tell his students present day practices were just as ridiculous as evidenced by the taboo of certain words in literature . He wrote the word " goo " on the board for which he received no definition , after which he stated that the word did not exist in English but in another culture it might exist as a taboo word . For an illustration closer to home the teacher wrote on the board a very controversial four-lettered word , and asked for volunteers to define it . After a couple of minutes of silence , a boy finally volunteered that the word meant " sexual intercourse . " There followed a brief discussion of taboos in English after which the teacher , without using the word orally , went on to other matters . After relying on the former cases , Keefe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as members of the faculties of large universities , the court expressed the opinion that : ... a teacher who uses a taboo sexual word must take care not to transcend his legitimate professional purpose . When a male teacher asks a class of adolescent boys and girls to define a taboo sexual word the question must not go beyond asking for verbal knowledge and become a titillating probe of privacy . He must not sacrifice his dignity to join his pupils as " frere et cochon . " Here , it should be stated unequivocally , there is no evidence that this plaintiff transcended legitimate professional purposes . Indeed , the court has specifically found he acted in good faith ( Id . at 1391 ) .  | In the ruling upholding the teacher , the court took occasion to define boundaries of academic freedom in the following terms : In support of a qualified right of a teacher , even at the secondary level , to use a teaching method which is relevant and in the opinion of experts of significant standing has a serious educational purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes that freedom in order to foster open minds , creative imaginations , and adventurous spirits . Our national belief is that the heterodox as well as the orthodox are a source of individual and of social growth . We do not confine academic freedom to conventional teachers or to those who can get a majority vote from their colleagues . Our faith is that the teacher 's freedom to choose among options for which there is any substantial support will increase his intellectual vitality and his moral strength . The teacher whose responsibility has been nourished by independence , enterprise , and free choice becomes for his student a better model of the democratic citizen . His examples of applying and adapting the values of the old order to the demands and opportunities of a constantly changing world are among the most important lessons he gives to youth ( Id . at 1391 ) . As indicated by the cases referred to above , the treatment of sex information by the teacher is usually condoned by the courts if the purpose has a relevant ,  | worthy and wholesome motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial support by referring to sexual matters before students in a manner that is irrelevant , oppressive and degrading. 1 . State v. Board of School Directors of Milwaukee , 14 Wis. 2d 243 , 111 N.W.2d 198 ( 1961 ) . A case in point involved a tenure teacher who was dismissed for discussing sex with a senior class in speech at a boys ' technical school in a manner which was considered by the school board to be improper . The offending teacher ( a ) explained procedures at houses of prostitution , ( b ) explained techniques of performing the sex act as if recounting personal experience , ( c ) condoned pre-marital sexual relations , ( d ) related vulgar stories , and ( e ) treated other aspects of sex in a manner which was alleged to be improper , unnecessary and unwholesome . In upholding the board 's dismissal on these charges the court stated : ... if relator 's discourses on sex in his speech classes had been conducted in such a manner as to constitute proper conduct in a biology class , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the happenstance that they took place in a speech class , absent any rule of the school authorities prohibiting the same or any specific warning to relator from the principal or superintendent that sex was not to be a subject of discussion in speech classes . However , if relator 's manner of discoursing on the topics of sex in his speech classes exceeded  | the bounds of the recognized standards of propriety , we deem that it constituted bad conduct which would warrant a discharge even though there was no express rule prohibiting it and he had received no warning to desist therefrom . As an intelligent person trained to teach at the high school level , relator should have realized that conduct was improper ( Id . at 206-207 ) . 2 . In re Witschen , 238 So . 2d 123 ( Fla. 1970 ) . Courts are less likely to approve improper attitudes and treatment of sex matters in the classroom than elsewhere . This is particularly true where the treatment has no relevancy to the course of instruction . An illustrative case is reported where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classroom of mixed boys and girls , relating to sex and virginity and premarital sex relations . " In its decision favoring the school board 's action the District Court of Appeals of Florida , First District , made the following comment : There are many factors which may have a material bearing upon the competency of the instructor , among which could be his attitude toward the students , his manner of speaking to them and his general lack of proper personality conducive to a mutual understanding . The instructor 's attitude and expression on moral conduct , sex questions as such , could also affect his competency . In addition , as to the immorality charge , there was evidence of unbecoming and unnecessary risque remarks made by the petitioner in a  | class of mixed teenage boys and girls which we agree with the School Board were of an immoral nature . 3 . Simon v. Jefferson Davis Parish School Board ( La . App. ) , 289 So . 2d 511 ( La. 1974 ) . In a much later case a high school teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of charges . Among the charges , one was that the plaintiff made the following statements to his class : A. Integration in churches and classrooms came recently , but in bed for a long time because if a white man wanted a little loving he would go across the tracks . B. The black man has had the idea that only white women could love adequately because of picture shows ... . C. Black girls have more illegitimate children because they ca n't afford to have anything done as white girls do . D. Obscenity and vulgarity are needed to motivate people ( Id . at 515 ) . The lower court upheld the board 's dismissal and the Court of Appeals of Louisiana affirmed the ruling of the lower court . The court said , in part : ... the appropriateness of certain actions is oftentimes dictated by the nature of the position held by an individual . More specifically a classroom teacher , merely by the nature of that position , should be aware of the impropriety of some practices .... We believe that the findings noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define their indecorum . Plaintiff contends that the statements made by him to his class are protected by his constitutional right of free speech , and by the right of academic freedom enjoyed by public school teachers . To this contention , the court responded : We conclude that the first and second noted statements made by plaintiff clearly served no serious educational purpose , and are therefore not entitled to protection . Moreover , without more connexity and relevancy than has been shown it is impossible for us to state that the school board and lower court erred ... ( Id at 517 ) . 1 . Oakland Unified School District of Alameda County v. Olicker , 25 Cal . App. 3d 1098 , 102 Cal . Rptr. 421 ( 1972 ) . A California case indicates that a teacher may be exonerated for obtaining and utilizing obscene material , regardless of how filthy it may be , if it is done with a useful educational purpose . The teacher involved in this case taught reading and social studies to eighth grade students who were difficult to teach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward their studies , and often used vulgar language toward each other . In an honest attempt to curb the use of obscenities and other acts of sexual misbehavior , the teacher hit upon a plan to follow the suggestion in a book she read  | entitled " Thirty-Six Children " which " advocated that children be allowed to determine the direction of their writing . " Another book she read , published by the New York Board of Education , " suggested that the way to handle obscenity was to bring it out into the open and to discuss its communicative value . " The teacher accordingly had the students write papers in the style and with the content they saw fit . Much to the dismay of the teacher , some of the papers turned out to be about as filthy and obscene as could possibly be conceived . ( They may be found in the case report . ) Nevertheless , as promised , the papers were duplicated and distributed for reading and evaluation , with the understanding that they would be destroyed . One boy , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mail box . When the board was apprised of the event , it dismissed the teacher on the grounds of " unfitness for service . " The action of the board was upheld by a superior court , but the lower court 's judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals , First District . Although admitting poor judgment of the teacher in her methods , the court held : The record before us contains no evidence that the conduct in question produced any disruption or impairment of discipline or of the teaching process , nor is there any showing by plaintiff that defendant 's retention in the teaching profession poses a significant danger or harm to either students , school employees , or others who might be affected by her actions as a teacher . To the contrary , the record  | discloses that , aside from this one incident , defendant was highly regarded as a teacher . As a teacher she was not unsensitive to the characteristics of the class with which she was dealing and to their educational , emotional and social handicaps . She devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the students , of overcoming their hostility , and in involving them in the learning process ( Id . at 429 ) ... . It must be concluded therefore that , under the principles set forth in Morrison , there is no support in the record for the trial court 's conclusion that defendant 's conduct constituted evident unfitness for service ( Id . at 430 ) . 2 . Celestine v. Lafayette Parish School Board , 284 So . 2d 650 ( La. 1973 ) . In this case it was ruled that poor judgment , coupled with a lack of an educational purpose , is just cause for dismissal of a teacher who required pupils to write a vulgar word 1000 times , in the presence of their classmates as a disciplinary measure for having used the word . The events leading to the litigation in this case are described in the case report as follows : Shortly after his class reconvened following the noon lunch period on the above mentione d date , plaintiff was confronted by several students who told him that two of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plaintiff thereupon asked the two girls in the presence of other members of the class whether they had been using vulgar language , and when  | they responded that they had , he instructed each of them to write the vulgar word 1000 times and to turn that work in to the principal for his signature , and to their parents for their signatures . One of the two girls to whom this assignment was given was eleven years of age at that time . Pursuant to the instructions given to them by plaintiff , each of these girls began writing a four-letter word , beginning with the letter " F , " being an extremely vulgar word meaning sexual intercourse . They spent the rest of that day carrying out the assignment of writing that word 1000 times ... ( Id at 652 ) . On the following day school officials met with the plaintiff teacher ( Celestine ) to discuss the incident , and later the Superintendent of Schools wrote a letter to the offending teacher advising him that he was being suspended indefinitely from duty without pay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recommendation of the superintendent that he be dismissed for incompetency . The plaintiff teacher refused to resign , so the board took formal action by dismissal . When taken to the court for judgment , the court refused to interfere with the board 's action , and stated : When there is a rational basis for an administrative board 's discretionary determinations which are supported by substantial evidence insofar as factually required , the court has no right to substitute its judgment for the administrative board 's or  | to interfere with the latter 's bona fide exercise of its discretion ( Id . at 653 ) . In a final attempt to win judicial consideration , the plaintiff contended that : his right to academic freedom as a teacher is protected by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution , and that this right entitles him to administer the punishment which was administered to the two young girls in his class ( Id . at 655 ) . In response to this contention the court made the following statement : We do not believe that the right of academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly very young people , to use and be exposed to vulgar words , particularly when no academic or educational purpose can possibly be served . In the instant suit , we agree with the School Board and the trial court that plaintiff did not have the right , under the principle of academic freedom or any other theory , to require an eleven year old girl to write the very vulgar word which was involved here even once , when no valid purpose conceivably could be served by the use of that word . He certainly had no right to require her to write such a word many times in the presence of her classmates . His very poor judgment in imposing such a requirement is sufficient to support the action of the School Board in dismissing him ( Id . at 655 ) .  | 3 . Jacobs v. Board of School Commissioners , 490 F.2d 601 ( 7th Cir. 1973 ) . In an Indiana case which went to a U. S. Court of Appeals , high school students brought action against school officials who challenged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and upon the grounds of public school buildings . The Court of Appeals " held that school board provisos pertaining to distribution of literature were invalid and that occasional presence of earthy ' words in unofficial student newspaper did not render the newspaper obscene " ( Id . at 602 ) . Rationale in the court 's decision is depicted in the following passage : In the first place , the issues of the Corn Cob Curtain in the record are very far from obscene in the legal sense . A few earthy words relating to bodily functions and sexual intercourse are used in the copies of the newspaper in the record . Usually they appear as expletives or at some similar level . One cartoon depicts a sequence of incidents in a bathroom . This material amounts to a very small part of the newspapers , which are tabloid size , containing eight or twelve pages . These issues contain no material which is in any significant way erotic , sexually explicit , or which could plausibly be said to appeal to the prurient interest of adult or minor ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Education of School District 149 , 502 F.2d 973 ( 7th Cir. 1974 ) . As indicated in a significant Illinois case , some teachers exercise poor  | judgment in choosing reading matter for students as a teaching tool . According to the case report , several teachers distributed to eighth-grade pupils a poem entitled " Getting Together " that was part of a brochure associated with the " Woodstock " rock festival . The brochure contained numerous vulgar and obscene words and pictures which the school board considered inappropriate for young children and cause for discharge of the offending teachers . The court upheld the board 's action in discharging the teachers , despite the testimony of " two eminently educated men " that the poem was proper material to be given eighth-grade pupils . The court , however , agreed with the view of a director of the state program for gifted children , " that the Woodstock brochure and its poetry had no educational value and was inappropriate for distribution to grammar school children . He found invalid the offered excuse that appellants had not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Id . at 982 ) . The censorship of reading materials in the public schools is often cause of concern for teachers ? especially teachers of English . The censorship springs from many sources , some of which are questionable from the standpoint of expertise and purpose . Previously censorship was by religious sanction ( and in some instances still is ) , but with the early breakdown  | of religious authority over public school matters , the censorship has been taken over by self-appointed citizens and " clean-books councils . " Their tactics are often intimidation and sloganeering , and they pressure school boards to act in their behalf . With the alleged purpose of keeping filth and smut from the children , they have succeeded in banning books such as Brave New World , Black Boy , Catcher in the Rye , and Manchild in the Promised Land . Many schools are presently being challenged and censored for permitting the use of textbooks containing alleged obscenities . As this manuscript is being prepared , the issue is being litigated in West Virginia with severe emotional reactions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued by a court of record . However , articles written by close observers of the situation indicate the potentiality of much litigation before the issues are resolved . Ken M. Young , Associate Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction , Kanawha County Schools , Charleston , West Virginia , portrays an almost unbelievable condition which prevails there as a result of the violent reaction to those who protested the alleged obscenities contained in textbooks , and demanded banning them from use . Just a sampling of the comments made by Young is quoted as follows : The school board is divided , the school board has resigned , and the superintendent said he will leave ... .  | Communities , churches , and social organizations are splitting , and friends and neighbors are at each other 's throats . School buses are riddled with sniper bullets , gas lines are cut , windshields are broken , and bomb threats disrupt schools daily . One minister has prayed publicly for the death of three board members . This crazy , unstable atmosphere is causing classroom teachers to look over their shoulders all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young , " Charleston , " Phi Delta Kappan , December 1974 , pp. 262-267 ) . In another article under the caption : " A clash over dirty books is dividing a school board , threatening a superintendent and shattering a community , " the associate editor of the American School Board Journal refers to the prevailing situation in Charleston : By mid-September , Kanawha County , the most populous and prosperous county in West Virginia , was experiencing a school book-banning war more complex and fanatical than any in recent U. S. history ( p. 32 ) . The author of the article mentions how the board attempted to deal with the dangerous affair . Prompted by increasing threats , danger and harm from the book-banners : The board felt compelled to make some sort of compromise in order to ( 1 ) lure boycotting parents to send their children back to school , and ( 2 ) defuse the crisis situation by wooing the roving bands of angry mothers and miners  | to stop picketing and closing down schools , mines and industry in the several county areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished both objectives .... But the hastily-passed concession did something else too : it showed a nation of TV watchers and newspaper readers that a relatively small group of fanatical book-banners could , through illegal means , actually ban books , even if only temporarily ( Philip G. Jones , " Clash over Dirty Books ... " , American School Board Journal , November , 1974 , pp. 31-32 , 41-43 ) . According to " Washington Report " published in the February 1975 issue of the Phi Delta Kappan : U. S. Commissioner of Education Terrel Bell 's jump into the middle of the recent controversies over the content of textbooks has made him both a villain and a hero . To some prominent and influential educators , he is a villain ; but to disturbed parents , especially those in West Virginia , and to numerous media editorial writers , he is a hero . Thus the new direction in some of today 's textbooks generates both praise and alarm . The debate is as old as education . The new twist is the involvement of the U.S.O.E. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand ( pp. 435-436 ) . The dilemma of school authorities in resolving the arguments arising from censorship is expressed in a book ( Theodore W. Hipple , Teaching English in Secondary Schools , The Macmillan Co. , 1973 ) as follows :  | Censorship battles rarely stem from student dissatisfaction with the readings assigned . Rather , parents and other adults in the community apply pressure to have a particular book banned or a particular teacher dismissed . It sometimes appears that school administrators run scared in the face of such community pressure , but , in truth , theirs is a different position . On the one hand , they want to honor their teachers ' rights to use professional judgment in the selection of learning materials , but on the other , they know they must have community support ; both financial and moral , to keep the scholastic ship afloat . Better to sacrifice one English teacher , some of them think , than to risk losing the next tax referendum and having half the teachers quit because of the district 's inability to increase their salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been drawn into the censorship controversies . Some English authorities look askance at judicial censorship of literary materials . Alarm over recent judicial censorship of good literature under the guise of diminishing obscenity in the classics is expressed by Lloyd Alexander ( " Seeing with the Third Eye , " English Journal , vol. 63 , No. 5 , May 1974 , pp. 35-40 ) in these words : I do n't think we 've felt the full impact of the Supreme Court 's ruling on obscenity . The first ripples are n't encouraging . The danger of course is that ripples spread far beyond the vexed question of obscenity ( p. 39 ) ... . Censorship , once begun , is hard to contain . It can spread to include any idea or attitude the  | censors find objectionable . At best , it can do little to protect morals .... At worst , censorship can lead to something even more pernicious : self censorship , generating not virtue but fear ( p. 40 ) . Justice Douglas confirms this apprehension , as evidenced by his following statement : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can be done to literature under the banner of obscenity can be done to other parts of the spectrum of ideas when party or majoritarian demands mount and propagandists start disclaiming the law ( Censorship : For and Against , Hart Publishing Company , 1971 , pp. 63-64 ) . It is stated in " Developments in the Law ? Academic Freedom " ( Harvard Law Review , LXXXI ( 1968 ) , 1054 ) : Most curricular prohibitions are based on judgments about the intrinsic educational value of the banned material ? that it is too difficult , trivial , misleading , or inconsistent with community values to permit its presentation to the students . Because courts possess no special competence to review the accuracy or wisdom of such judgments , it would be unwise for them to interpret the unelaborated injunctions of due process of the First Amendment as a general mandate for undertaking such a task . In his dissent , Justice Black expressed his belief that the decision in Ginzburg v. United States , 383 U.S. 463  | ( 1966 ) , makes it exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about sex ( Id . at 478 ) . Legislative enactments and judicial decisions designed to curb obscenities in literature are neither effective nor proper , for at least two reasons . First , the lawmakers and judges do not necessarily possess the professional expertise to evaluate the content and style of literary works . And , second , laws and court decisions establish precedents that frequently outlive their applicability . This is emphasized in a book ( Terrence J. Murphy , Censorship , Government and Obscenity , Baltimore , 1963 , pp. 211-212 ) , as follows : The objection often raised against the enactment of obscenity laws on the grounds that the laws would prohibit classics that deal with sex overlooks , among other things , the fact that the pruriency of sex is to be judged by contemporary standards . Whatever may have been the impact of the classics on the readers of its day , its effect today might not be an appeal to the prurient interest . Its style , language , imagery , literary techniques and conventions , and general handling of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern reader to excite his lustful interest . The American Civil Liberties Union has recognized that the appeal of a publication may change as the cultural environment changes . It proposes that after a " reasonable time " has elapsed a book judged to be obscene might be reexamined to  | determine if its effect is still the same as it was at an earlier period . Consequently the teaching profession itself is in the most strategic position to assume the responsibility and obligation for censorship , according to a recent publication ( Readings for Teaching English in Secondary Schools , The Macmillan Company , New York , 1973 ) . In it , the National Council of Teachers of English offers many suggestions to teachers as to what would meet reasonable censorship . A pertinent statement of the NCTE 's Commission on Literature follows : No literary work is in itself proper or improper for the schools . Its suitability must be judged in terms of its development of the student 's intelligence and critical sensibility , and the effect on the student of the book taken as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case must rest with those best qualified by training ' and experience to do so , the members of the teaching profession in English . In an NIA article ( " The NEA Looks at the Censorship Question , " The Leaflet , LXVIII , May 1969 , p. 20 ) , Joseph D. Devlin states the position of the professional organization : The primary responsibility of an educator is to educate , to lead a student to real maturity . An English teacher does this by exposing a student to literature of all kinds , literature which depicts the dignities as well as the depravities of man 's striving .... Literature ,  | sensitively and maturely presented by a teacher who is a real humanist , can carry the student into a world of humanity frequently skirted in the search of other forms of faster and more immediate experience . Professor Shuman , supra , states most succinctly where the responsibility for selecting reading materials properly belongs : If the English classroom is to be a vital place and if the teaching of English is to have valid outcomes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books to be taught . Presumably English teachers are responsible people . They do not choose their texts in order to sway students to the ways of life depicted in the books which are being read ( p. 19 ) . Despite all the controversy and litigation over the use of obscenities in teaching and elsewhere , there are some who doubt the harm is as great as many fear . At least one might gain that impression by reading The Obscenity Report ( Stein and Day , New York , 1970 ) . ( Note : Because of the controversial nature of the Report to the Task Force on Pornography and Obscenity , it was not intended originally to be released for public consumption , but was done so " because of the American people 's constitutional right to a free press and to the circulation of ideas . " ) Although the Commission 's Report does not contain much information which applies specifically to schools , it does contain one statement which will be surprising  | and perhaps refuted by those who agitate over the alleged harmful effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In sum , empirical research designed to clarify the question has found no evidence to date that exposure to explicit sexual materials plays a significant role in the causation of Delinquent or criminal behavior among youth or adults . The Commission can not conclude that exposure to erotic materials is a factor in the causation of sex crimes or sex delinquency  | Although marriage of female teachers is no longer a litigious issue , it is significant to glance back at the early instances in which the issue was litigated . Of course local school boards have never been required to discriminate , nor have they been prohibited from discriminating , with regard to marital status in their selection of qualified teachers ? male or female . Nevertheless school boards may write provisions in the teacher 's contract declaring a teacher subject to dismissal if marrying while in service . While some courts may hold such contractual policies legal , there have been many exceptions . A notable exception is that of Richards v. District School Board for School District No. 1 , 78 Ore . 621 , 153 P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon held that a board of education could not legally dismiss a female teacher who married , while under contract , even though the board might have adopted a rule reserving to itself the right to dismiss teachers under such circumstances . The school board rule which the involved teacher ignored was stated as follows :  | Married women shall not be eligible to positions as teachers in the district except by special resolution of the board . All women teachers who marry during their time of service , thereby terminate their contracts with the district ( Id . at 482 ) . In overturning the school board 's action , the court reasoned as follows : If a teacher becomes inefficient or fails to perform a duty , or does some act which of itself impairs usefulness , then a good or reasonable cause for dismissal would exist . The act of marriage , however , does not , of itself , furnish a reasonable cause . That the marriage status does not necessarily impair the competency of all women teachers is conceded by the school authorities when they employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach in the schools of this district . The clerk of the board admitted that in some instances a woman becomes a better teacher after marriage than she was before . The reason advanced for the rule adopted by the board is that after marriage a woman may devote her time and attention to her home rather than to her school work ( Id . at 485 ) . It is impossible to know in advance whether the efficiency of any person will become impaired because of marriage , and a rule which assumes that all persons do become less competent because of marriage is unreasonable because such a regulation is purely arbitrary . If a teacher is just as competent and efficient after marriage , a dismissal because of marriage would be  | capricious . If a teacher is neglectful , incompetent , and inefficient , she ought to be discharged whether she is married or whether she is single ( Id . at 485-486 ) . Other cases supporting Richards , such as People v. Maxwell , 177 N.Y . 494 , 69 N.E. 1092 ( 1904 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . App. 541 ; 30 S.W.2d 621 ( 1930 ) add stability to the legal precedent that a board of education does not have the implied authority to adopt and enforce a regulation that marriage on the part of a woman teacher shall terminate her contract . In schools , as well as elsewhere , the weight of judicial authority is to the effect that contracts in restraint of marriage are void because they are contrary to public policy . Pregnancies under normal conditions are legal for married as well as unwed females . ( In fact they are essential for the perpetuation of society . ) Usually the judiciary condones the pregnancy of a married teacher , subject to maternity leave provisions . The pregnancy of an unmarried teacher , however , presents a situation which would be the subject of litigation , especially where right of tenure is concerned . But even here , the weight of judicial authority upholds the pregnant unwed teacher in the security of her teaching position . 1 . Drake v. Covington County Board of Education , 371 F. Supp. 974 ( Ala. 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant teacher was successful in a dismissal suit .  | The involved teacher in this case was advised by letter that the Board of Education of Covington County proposed to cancel her employment contract for " immorality " after the board had been presented with a physician 's certificate that she became pregnant during the school year at which time she was a single unmarried person . At a hearing which followed , Drake ( the pregnant teacher ) " admitted that she had engaged in sexual intercourse with her fiance in private on a number of occasions , " and added : " I 'm twenty-eight years old and I do n't think the Board or anybody else can tell me what I can do with my private life . " On the basis of this confession , she was advised that " the Board had voted not to renew her contract . " The applicable section of the Alabama law , which came into focus at this juncture , states the grounds for cancellation of employment as follows : Cancellation of an employment contract with a teacher on continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect of duty , immorality , justifiable decrease in number of teaching positions , or other good and just cause ; but cancellation may not be made for political or personal reasons ( Id . at 976 ) . Since the board originally charged Drake with " immorality , " she claimed that the immorality provision of the section did not apply because of its vagueness and unconstitutionality . The court , not being too concerned about the " immorality " issue , stated : " We hold that the statute  | was applied in this case in a manner which violated Drake 's constitutional right of privacy " ( Id . at 977 ) . In referring to several , other cases involving the restriction of the right of privacy in sexual matters to married and unmarried persons , the court stated : If the right of privacy means anything , it is the right of the individual , married or single , to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as a decision whether to bear or beget a child ( Id . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been permanently resolved is evidenced by the split decision of the court . In fact , the dissent in the Drake case was severe and stated more at length than the majority opinion . District Judge Varner disagreed with the majority that Drake was entitled to reinstatement as a public school teacher . Just a single paragraph from his lengthy dissent follows : In the instant case , there was evidence from which the Board may have found that Miss Drake was immoral and that such conduct interfered with her teaching ability . The Board found her guilty of " immorality " in the word used by the statute without specifying whether it implicitly found a nexus with her teaching ability . Her claim that her sexual conduct was private paled when she admitted that it was publicly discussed in Florala . Rumor of immorality of a public school teacher in a small town travels fast and has a larger impact on the educational process than in a city . It is difficult to see how a Court can require of a Board composed of laymen the  | niceties of charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of constitutional niceties , particularly when these requisites are not called to their attention . Rather it seems more appropriate to me that the Plaintiff , having the burden of proof , should be required to prove that her discharge was constitutionally defective . The technical defect , right of privacy , on which the majority relies , was not pointed out so that the Board might call for and specifically consider evidence thereof at the time of the hearing . It is difficult for this Court to learn from the evidence how Miss Drake 's secret first became a public rumor associated with a public figure . It is enough to interfere with operation of a school system that it did ( Id . at 9817982 ) . 2 . Andrews v. Drew Municipal Separate School District , 371 F. Supp. 27 ( Miss . 1973 ) . The legality of pregnant unwed school personnel enters into the process of hiring as well as firing . For example , a Mississippi case developed from a contested local school board policy which forbids employment of school personnel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of whom were black females , qualified professionally to be employed as teachers ' aides in the Drew Public Schools . They contended that the board policy or practice was violative of equal protection because it creates an unconstitutional classification to both race and sex . The defendant school board , however , countered by insisting that the policy was valid because it " applied equally to black and white , male and female . " It is significant to note from the case  | report , that " no white person has been found to be an unwed parent , and denied employment because of the stated policy " ( Id . at 30 ) . In ruling against the school officials by granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs , the court presented its views in the following manner : This court readily recognizes that public school officials have the undoubted authority to adopt reasonable employee qualification criteria ( including the possession of good character traits ) applicable to administrators , teachers , staff and public school employees generally . It is also acknowledged that , subject to constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leeway in imposing employee qualifications to suit the particular needs of the school or school district involved . Certainly , no school administrator or board should be precluded from denying employment to any one determined to be of bad moral character upon a fair and unbiased consideration of pertinent information , and we do not make the slightest intimation otherwise . After a careful review of Drew 's policy and the relevant evidence , however , we hold that the policy or practice of barring an otherwise qualified person from being employed , or considered for employment , in the public schools merely because of one 's previously having had an illegitimate child has no rational relation to the objectives ostensibly sought to be achieved by the school officials and is fraught with invidious discrimination ; thus , it is constitutionally defective under the traditional , and most lenient , standard of equal  | protection and violative of due process as well . Alternatively , the policy , both inherently and as applied , constitutes an impermissible , discriminatory classification based upon sex . We find it unnecessary to reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at 31 ) . The court went on to point out the unreasonableness of the policy because : . . . it conclusively presumes the parent 's immorality or bad moral character from the single fact of a child born out of wedlock . By the rule , a parent , whether male or female , who has had such a child , would be forever precluded from employment . Thus , no consideration would be given to the subsequent marriage of the parent or to the length of time elapsed since the illegitimate birth , or to a person 's reputation for good character in the community . A person could live an impeccable life , yet be barred as unfit for employment for an event , whether the result of indiscretion or not , occurring at any time in the past . But human experience refutes the dogmatic attitude inherent in such a policy against unwed parents ( Id at 33 ) . In conclusion the court stated : The defendants in the case sub judice have made no showing whatever that their policy against employing unwed parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of an educational program . Hence , the policy can not survive strict judicial scrutiny ( Id . at 37 ) .  | 3 . Reinhardt v. Board of Education of Alton Community Unit School District No. 11 , 19 Ill . App. 3d 481 , 311 N.E.2d 710 ( 1974 ) . An unusual case is reported wlhere a teacher with thirteen years of tenure had been married for just one month , but had been pregnant for eight and one-half months . Somewhat belatedly , but ultimately , the teacher reported to a school official that she would not be able to return to work for three months and was therefore requesting sick leave for that period . After struggling with the perplexing problem for several weeks , the superintendent called the teacher to his office and suggested that " it would be in her and the board 's best interest 1 if she ' would resign . " Accordingly she signed a letter of , , resignation ? but the next day she withdrew the resignation . This placed the board in a quandary , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immorality and because , in the opinion of the Board of Education , the interests of the schools of this school district require such dismissal " ( Id . at 711 ) . It is significant to point but at this juncture that the Illinois statute reads : " Immorality ' is sufficient cause for discharge of tenured teacher only where record shows harm to pupils , , faculty , or school itself " ( Id . at 710 ) . The court , in holding to that statutory provision , stated : The record of the hearings before the board discloses no injury to the students , faculty or school . No parents of children in her classroom complained . There is no evidence of any  | breakdown in her relationships with other teachers , no evidence that her teaching ability was affected in any manner , and no evidence that the standing of the school as an education institution was in any manner affected by appellee 's actions . Without evidence of harm , there can not properly be a finding of irremediability ( Id . at 712 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the following paragraph : Since there is in the record below no proof of harm to pupils , faculty , or the school , the circuit court properly reversed the Board 's action dismissing appellee on the grounds of immorality and best interests of the school district . Such charges were unsupported by the evidence ( Id . at 713 ) . Many state statutes permit school boards to provide for maternity leaves of pregnant teachers . Usually the school board had been authorized to stipulate when the maternity leave shall begin and end . 1 . Kornblum v. Newark Unified School District , 37 Cal . App. 3d 623 , 112 Cal . Rptr. 457 ( 1974 ) . There have been a number of cases , both at the state and federal level , in which the stipulated time limit of the maternity leave was challenged in the courts . A case in point involved a probationary teacher who defied a school district rule that the pregnant teacher must go on maternity leave " three months prior to the expected  | birth of the child and is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the leave is granted . In no event may the employee return to work less than three months following the birth of the child " ( Id . at 458 ) . According to the case report : Plaintiff had experienced no medical problems related to her pregnancy and had been advised by her doctor that she could continue working as a teacher up until the child was born and could resume teaching two weeks after giving birth . She did in fact resume teaching on a substitute basis , in another school district , two weeks after her child was born . Plaintiff had desired to continue teaching right up until the birth of her child and to resume teaching as soon thereafter as her doctor thought permissible . She did not feel obligated to notify the school district of the anticipated date of birth because she believed the district 's rule to be unreasonable and discriminatory to women . The court acknowledged that the teachers should give advance notice of their pregnant condition in order to facilitate the administrative planning toward the important objective of continuity ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is apparent that the requirement of Rule " K " that a teacher go on maternity leave three months prior to the expected birth date of her child is unconstitutional and therefore invalid . The same is likewise true of the provision  | precluding a teacher who has gone on maternity leave from resuming her employment within three months of the birth of her child ( Id . at 459 ) . 2 . Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur , 94 S. Ct . 791 ( Ohio 1974 ) , and 3 . Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board , 94 S. Ct . 791 ( Va . 1974 ) . With the conflicting opinions of lower federal cases concerning the mandatory leave rules of pregnant teachers , it was obvious that the issue would ultimately be settled by the highest court in the land . And so it was . In order to resolve the conflicts between the Courts of Appeals regarding the constitutionality of the leave rules , the United States Supreme Court granted certiorarifor two companion cases which had gone through the entire judicial hierarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleveland and Cohen of Chesterfield County , Virginia ) refused to abide by the board policy which required a pregnant teacher to take unpaid maternity leave five months before expected childbirth and to continue until the next regular semester after the child is three months old . The teachers , in each instance , insisted on their teaching until approximately a month before " expectancy " and to resume teaching as soon as they felt able to do so . The court introduced its opinion in the following passages : This court has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by  | the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . By acting to penalize the pregnant teacher for deciding ' to bear a child , overly restrictive maternity leave regulations can constitute a heavy burden on the exercise of these protected freedoms . Because public school maternity leave rules directly affect " one of the basic civil rights of man , " . . . the Due Process Clause . . . requires that such rules must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital area of a teacher 's constitutional liberty ( Id . at 796 ) . The court had to consider two main reasons why the board claimed it was necessary to adopt the mandatory leave rule : ( 1 ) to keep the pregnant teacher out of the classroom during the specified final months of pregnancy to protect the health of the teacher and her unborn child ; and ( 2 ) to attain continuity by assuring students of having a physically capable instructor in the classroom at all times . In response ' to the first reason set forth by the board , the court said , in part : ... question is whether the rules sweep too broadly . That question must be answered in the affirmative , for the provisions amount to a conclusive presumption that every pregnant teacher who reaches the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy is physically incapable of continuing . There is no individualized determination by the teacher 's doctor ? or the school board 's ? as to any particular teacher 's ability to continue at her job . The rules contain  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applies even when the medical evidence as to an individual woman 's physical status might be wholly to the contrary ( Id . at 798 ) . With respect to the second reason of the board that the rules provided for " continuity , " the court reasoned as follows : Were continuity the only goal , cut-off dates much later during the pregnancy would serve as well or better than the challenged rules , provided that ample advance notice requirements were retained . Indeed , continuity would seem just as well attained if the teacher herself were allowed to choose the date ' upon which to commence her leave , at least so long as the decision were required to be made and notice given of it well in advance of the date selected ( Id . at 797 ) . In sure , the majority opinion of the United States Supreme Court is stated as follows : We conclude , therefore , that neither the necessity for continuity of instruction nor the state interest in keeping physically unfit teachers out of the classroom can justify the sweeping mandatory leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted . While the regulations no doubt represent a good-faith attempt to achieve a laudable goal , they can not pass muster under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , because they employ irrebuttable presumptions that unduly  | penalize a female teacher for deciding to bear a child ( Id . at 800 ) . In fairness to the opinion of the minority , it should be noted that Justice Rehnquist , with whom the Chief Justice joined , offered a brief dissent which ended with the following sentence : If legislative bodies are to be permitted to draw a general line anywhere short of the delivery room , I can find no judicial standard of measurement which says the ones drawn here were invalid ( Id . at 806 ) . 4 . Black v. School Committee of Malden , 310 N.E.2d 330 ( Mass. 1974 ) . Presumably the LaFleur and Cohen cases , which were decided by the United States Supreme Court , would make other cases which deal with the mandatory sick leave issue somewhat academic . Nevertheless , more cases on the same issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a maternity leave rule was declared unconstitutional to the extent that it required teachers to resign at the end of the fourth month of pregnancy , and to the extent that reinstatement was not permitted until six months after the birth of the child . That part of the case was settled by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts without much difficulty , as indicated by a statement of the court : " The questions relate to the so called maternity leave ' and our task has been lightened by recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on the constitutional aspects of that subject " ( Id . at 332 ) .  | On the other aspect of the case , where the teacher demanded sick pay for disabilities related to pregnancy , the regulation of the board was upheld and the teacher was denied the sick pay demanded . The rationale of the court on this point ? which was supported by a number of other Supreme Court decisions ? may be read in the following passage : The Supreme Court was not called on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work because of pregnancy-related disabilities could be afforded diametrically different rights to sick pay than a teacher suffering from other temporary physical disability . But a classification such as that exemplified by the Malden sick leave rule appears arbitrary and unconstitutional , whether or not one relates it to discrimination based exclusively on sex .. . and especially is the classification invidious , since it burdens fundamental freedom of choice in marriage and family life . The Malden rule evidently applied to all illnesses or medical conditions causing absence from work ? except pregnancy . The only justification suggested to us was that , with the means of family planning available today , pregnancy with its attendant infirmities is a condition " voluntarily " assumed , unlike ordinary sickness and injury which are said to be " involuntary . " The distinction is shallow . We are not really helped by trying to classify pregnancy as " voluntary " or " involuntary . " It is rather a natural incident of married life that definitely results in disability , but of variable  | duration .... In a sense , pregnancy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonessential activities with obvious risks of injury , such as playing games or even driving an automobile .... We are not to be understood as intimating that no State interests can ever conceivably be asserted to justify particular distinctions for purposes of sick leave between pregnancy and other disabilities .... It is enough for this case to say that categorical disallowance of all sick pay for disabilities related to pregnancy was improper when sick leave was allowed for the other disabilities whether voluntary , predictable , normal or unique ( Id . at 338-339 ) . 5 . Hutchison v. Lake Oswego School District No. 7 , 374 F. Supp. 1056 ( Ore . 1974 ) . This case involved an action by a school teacher for declaratory judgment and damages for failure of a school board to permit the teacher to apply for accumulated sick leave for childbirth-caused incapacity . Facts of the case indicate the teacher ( plaintiff ) informed the principal of the school that she was pregnant and would be absent for approximately three weeks with the birth of her child . At the time of childbirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she returned to her employment , she requested that she be allowed to use her accumulated sick leave for her absence . The superintendent of schools denied her request and the denial was affirmed by the defendant board members . They argued that the Oregon law on sick leave is  | defined as " absence from duty because of a teacher 's illness or injury , " and that it " does not include maternity within the definition of illness or injury . ' " The court held in favor of the plaintiff teacher and concluded with the following declaration : Defendants have intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . They have discriminated on the basis of sex by denying sick-leave benefits for childbirthrelated disabilities . Plaintiff has also shown a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In determining sick-leave benefits , defendant 's distinction between childbirth-caused disabilities and other medical disabilities is arbitrary and irrational . The distinction serves no legitimate interest of the Board of the School District . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear children ( Id . at 1065 ) . 6 . Bradley v. Cothern , 384 F. Supp. 1216 ( Tex . 1974 ) . In this case a public school teacher brought a civil action challenging the termination of her teaching contract and refusal by the school district to reinstate her to a teaching position following the birth of her child . The normal practice in the District was for a teacher to resign or take a leave of absence when she learned she was pregnant and then notify the administration when she desired to return , after which she would be placed in the District if there was a vacancy in her field . In Mrs. Bradley 's case , however , she was not considered for vacancies when they did occur .  | In ruling in favor of the teacher , the court stated : While it is constitutionally permissible for a school district to require a teacher to discontinue her services when she is physically unable to continue , and then defer her return for a reasonable period of time following the birth of her child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incumbent upon the District to give her a priority return to teaching when the first available position in her field becomes vacant . To do otherwise would intrude too far into a teacher 's personal choice in matters of family life , which has long been held to be protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . This intrusion would not be justified by any 1 . Danielson v. Board of Higher Education , 358 F. Supp. 22 ( N.Y . 1972 ) . Some weird court cases can evolve from the 1972 Amendments of the Civil Rights Act , especially where maternity leaves are involved . A case in point is that of Ross Danielson , a lecturer in sociology at the University of New York , who applied for a " parental leave " to care for his newborn son . Since his wife , who also was a lecturer , planned to go back to work immediately following the birth , he wanted to stay home for six months ( with pay afforded a mother as provided for maternity leave ) to care for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took action against the University , by challenging the  | constitutionality of defendant 's maternity leave provision . The essence of Danielson 's claim is that women faculty members are permitted to take a leave of absence in connection with pregnancy , up to three semesters , for the purpose , among others , of caring for a newborn infant , without adversely affecting their tenure rights , but the same child care leave privilege is denied to men ( Id at 24 ) ... . Mr. Danielson 's primary claim is that his right to equal protection of the laws has been violated by defendant 's refusal to extend to him the same child care leave privilege which they extend to women solely because he is a man . He claims that by so discriminating against men who seek to fully participate in the care of their children , defendants are effectively denying men the right to play a full and equal role in their families . He then argues that the fact that child care has traditionally been considered women 's work is no more an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to bar women from certain kinds of employment ( Id at 27 ) . The University filed a motion to strike the complaint but Judge Baker for the United States District Court , S. W. New York , denied the motion , holding that " the complaint stated a good cause for action . " Although this particular case arose in an institution of higher learning , the legal precedent evolving therefrom could conceivably be applied to similar  | situations arising in the elementary and secondary schools . 2 . Ackerman v. Board of Education of the City of New York , 372 F. Supp. 274 ( N.Y . 1974 ) . Another somewhat similar case arose in New York in 1974 . In this case , however , a male teacher 's motion for childcare leave was denied , but for different reasons than those applied to the previous case ( Danielson ) . Facts of the case indicate that : Plaintiffs , Gary and Rita Ackerman , instituted this action on their own behalf and on the behalf of over " 5,000 male licensed teachers employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied the right to privately determine how they will raise their families without the arbitrary interference and unconstitutional discrimination by the Defendants . " ( The defendants are the Board of Education . ) ( Id . at 276 . ) Ackerman would have had no just cause for complaint , whatsoever , under the original 1970 statute , the relevant part of which reads : " As soon as any regular or nonregular employee in the teaching staff shall become aware of her pregnancy , she shall apply for a leave of absence for the purpose of maternity and child care . " Three years later , however , Ackerman did have a just cause to file a complaint because in 1973 the statute was amended , under section 107 , to provide child care leave " to a natural or adoptive parent upon application " ( Id . at 276 ) .  | It was decided by the United States District Court , S. D. New York , that the number of persons in this class suit was so few " that joinder of all members is impracticable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputy Executive Director of the Board of Education , some 40% of the approximately 66,000 teachers employed by the Board of Education are male . On the other hand , Shorter 's deposition and his affidavit indicate that Gary was the first male teacher to apply for child care leave and that only one other male teacher applied for child care leave prior to the effective date of the 1973 amendment to section 107 . Since plaintiffs have failed to show that the alleged class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable , their motion for an order declaring that this action be maintained as a class action is denied ( Id . at 277 ) . Were it not for the default of " class action " the plaintiff in this case may have had more of a valid claim , according to a statement of the court : .. Although the question of declaratory relief may not be mooted entirely because of the continued existence of plaintiffs ' claims for monetary relief , the appropriateness of the declaratory remedy is questionable now that the amendment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascribe to it ( Id . at 277 ) .  | Census reports reveal that teen-age marriages have been increasing steadily during recent decades . Many of these marriages occur before graduation from high school . Consequently the boys and girls involved either drop out of school before graduation or continue to attend school as married students . In either case the board of education is confronted with a problem that frequently leads to controversy and even litigation . The school board 's concern over the increase of student marriages and the problems arising therefrom is evidenced by the numerous written or unwritten policies designed to regulate school attendance of the married students in one manner or another . Some of the board 's regulations on the student marriage issue are so severe and objectionable that they are challenged by court action . Although there has been no litigation at the higher court level involving truancy of married high school boys , there have been two reported cases resulting from attempts to apply the compulsory school attendance  | regulations to married girls . In both cases the legal principle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been firmly ? and likely permanently ? established . 1 . State v. Priest , 210 La. 389 , 27 So . 2d 173 ( 1946 ) . In the first of such cases involving this issue , a 15-year- old girl discontinued attending school after becoming married . Because of her alleged truancy , the girl was committed to the State Industrial School by order of the Juvenile Court . The case was appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court where it was ruled that marriage does emancipate a minor female and accordingly releases her from school attendance . An aggravated complication of this case was caused by the marriage taking place at an age earlier than that sanctioned by state law . The girl was only 15 years of age when married , despite the fact that the Louisiana law stipulated that a marriage ceremony , by officials , of females between the ages of 14 and 16 was prohibited . Nevertheless , the court reasoned , that once performed , a marriage becomes valid ? if there are no legal impediments other than age ? and that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has the right to live at the matrimonial domicile of her husband and is no longer under the control of her parents " ( Id at 174 ) . In rendering its decision , the court apparently was looking ahead to future potentialities ? as reflected in its concluding statement : " The wife , in the event there should be a child in the family , could hardly be expected  | to attend school during the weeks preceding or following its birth . " 2 . In re State in Interest of Goodwin , 214 La. 1062 , 39 So . 2d 731 ( 1949 ) . The other case was tried also in the Supreme Court of Louisiana just three years later and dealt with the same issue of attempting to apply the compulsory school attendance law . As in the earlier and somewhat similar case , the lower court decided that because of truancy a young married girl ( age 14 ) was delinquent , and she was accordingly ordered to attend the State Industrial School for Girls . On appeal to the State Supreme Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the earlier case , the girl could not legally be required to attend school , by virtue of the fact that she was " irrevocably emancipated . " The court contended that , having acquired the status of a wife , it was " not only her right but also her duty to live with her husband at their matrimonial domicile and to follow him wherever he chooses to reside " ( Id at 733 ) . The court expressed sympathy for the trial judge 's " deep convictions of the tragedy inherent in the marriage of girls of tender years and his skepticism of any good resulting therefrom , " but nevertheless emphasized the fact that : under our system of government the matter of fixing the public policy ... with respect to the age at which people may or may not marry as well as fixing the status of marriages solemnized in violation thereof lies exclusively  | within the province of the legislative branch ( Id . at 734 ) . In direct contrast to those cases where school boards attempt to compel school attendance of married girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to prohibit school attendance of married girls . The two earliest higher court cases involving prohibitive regulations were decided in 1929 and it was not until 1957 when another such case was reported . 1 . McLeod v. State of Mississippi , 154 Miss . 468 , 122 So . 737 ( 1929 ) . The facts of the first case in this category indicate that the school trustees of Moss Point , Mississippi , adopted an ordinance , barring from schools married students , even though in all other respects they might be eligible to attend . Subsequently , a young girl , 15 years of age and married , but otherwise eligible , applied for admission and was enrolled , but when it was discovered by the superintendent that she was married , she was denied admission for the alleged claim that " married students are detrimental to the good government and usefulness of the school . " This claim was forcefully set aside by the court as is revealed in the following declaration : It is argued that marriage emancipates a child from all parental control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school authorities ; and that the marriage relation brings about views of life which should not be known to unmarried children ; that a married child in the public  | schools will make known to its associates in schools such views , which will therefore be detrimental to the welfare of the school . We fail to appreciate the force of the argument . Marriage is a domestic relation highly favored by the law . When the relation is entered into with correct motives , the effect on the husband and wife is refining and elevating , rather than demoralizing . Pupils associating in school with a child occupying such a relation , it seems , would be benefited instead of harmed . And , furthermore , it is commendable in married persons of school age to further pursue their education , and thereby become better fitted for the duties of life . And they are as much subject to the rules of the school as unmarried pupils , and punishable to the same extent for a breach of such rules ( Id . at 738-739 ) . 2 . Nutt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kan. 507 , 278 P. 1065 ( 1929 ) . The reported facts of the second case in this category reveal that a plaintiff 's daughter was enrolled in the public high school as a sophomore and had completed the first semester , at which time she left school . She re-entered a year later as a married person , and was accordingly advised that she would no longer be allowed to attend school . Apparently the main reason for the board 's refusal to re-admit the married girl was because of alleged immorality . She had given birth to a child conceived out of wedlock . Moreover , the board charged that she no longer lived with the father of the child , but associated with other men and attended social parties .  | On the basis of the record submitted , however , the court found insufficient evidence to warrant the board 's exclusion of the girl from the public schools . The court contended the board 's action was invalid and declared : The fact that the plaintiff 's daughter desired to attend school was of itself an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that she had a child conceived out of wedlock , no sufficient reason is advanced for preventing her from attending school . Her child was born in wedlock , and the fact that her husband may have abandoned her should not prevent her from gaining an education which would better fit her to meet the problems of life ( Id . at 1066 ) . 1 . State v. Marion County Board of Education , 202 Tenn. 29 , 302 S.W.2d 57 ( 1957 ) . Somewhat later than the two previous cases dealing with prohibited attendance of married girls , another case arose in Tennessee where a school board also prohibited attendance of married girls ? but for a limited time only . With this limited qualification , the school board policy was upheld by the Supreme Court of Tennessee . Here a board adopted a resolution in which it was recited that " there has arisen a serious problem concerning the marriage of high school students , " so that in the opinion of the board , the practice was " detrimental to the progress and general well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was resolved that any student marrying during the school term would automatically be expelled for the remainder of that term . This resolution was promptly made known to the students . Nevertheless , shortly thereafter an 18-year-old girl married with the expectation that she would be permitted to attend school for several more months so that she might graduate at the end of the term . In accordance with the terms of the resolution , the board promptly forbade her the privilege of attending school for the remainder of the school year . She was advised , however , that she would be permitted to re-enter the next school year . A writ of mandamus to immediately have the girl restored to enrollment so that she could graduate in May was denied . It was averred by school officials that there had been a deterioration of the discipline and decorum in the schools " due to student marriages . " The principals of the four high schools involved stated " confusion and disorder usually occurred immediately after the marriage and during the period of readjustment . " It was emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other students was also greatest at this time . In this case the court found the board regulation to be reasonable , and therefore beyond the realm of judicial interference . The court concluded by voicing its confidence in the professional judgment of the school principals : We are accustomed to accept the testimony of experts in the various fields of human  | activity as to what is reasonably necessary for the welfare of the particular activity as to which this expert therein is testifying . No reason is suggested as to why this practice should not be followed when the witness is an expert in the field of operating public high schools . Certainly the principals of the high schools in question should be regarded by reason of training , experience and observation as possessing particular knowledge as to the problem which they say is made by the marriage and uninterrupted attendance of students in their respective schools ( Id . at 59 ) . According to the preceding case just cited a school board could ( in 1957 ) legally prohibit attendance of a student for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been established that there is a limit to the " limited time " provision . Certainly it can not be stretched to " permanently . " 2 . Alvin Independent School District v. Cooper , 404 S.W.2d 76 ( Tex . 1966 ) . The legal principle that a girl can not be permanently denied a legal education because of marriage was substantiated by a Texas case . The case involved a 16-year-old girl who , in her sophomore year in high school , was married and withdrew from school . Subsequently , a child was born to the marriage . The girl divorced her husband and sought readmission to the high school . In the meantime the school board formulated a rule designed to permanently exclude such persons from school . The rule reads thus :  | A pupil who marries can no longer be considered a youth . By the very act of getting married , he or she becomes an adult and assumes the responsibility of adulthood .... If a married pupil wants to start her family , she must withdraw from public school . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her education in the local adult education program and correspondence courses ( Id . at 77 ) . In voiding the board 's rule , the court stated : " The practical and legal effect is that appellee is deprived of a legal education , except as she might obtain it at her own expense in a private or parochial school " ( Id . at 77 ) . 3 . Board of Education of Harrodsburg v. Bentley , 383 S.W.2d 677 ( Ky. 1964 ) . Another case tested the validity of a school board regulation that : Any student , either girl or boy , who marries , automatically must withdraw immediately from school and can not re-enter school for one full year , and then only as a special student with permission of the principal . A special student can not attend home room or study halls or enter into any class activities , social events or athletics ... ( Id . at 678 ) . The trial court adjudged that the regulation is invalid and granted a permanent injunction against enforcement of the regulation as applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of the trial court and expressed its rationale for doing so thus :  | It is our conclusion that the decision of the trial court is correct ; the instant regulation is arbitrary and unreasonable , and therefore void . The fatal vice of the regulation lies in its sweeping , advance determination that every married student , regardless of circumstances , must lose at least a year 's schooling .... Additionally , after it may be reasoned that the disturbing influence of the event has subsided , the situation is returned to the " spotlight " of student attention by compelling withdrawal of the married student ; after a year , assuming the principal is willing , the student is to be reinstated , thus injecting another occasion for student body agitation ( Id at 680-681 ) . 4 . Anderson v. Canyon Independent School District , 412 S.W.2d 387 ( Tex . 1967 ) . The rash of court cases concerning attendance regulations of married students during the 1960 's diminished with a 1967 Texas case , where the Amarillo School Board adopted a policy stating : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for the remainder of the school year " ( Id . at 388 ) . In accordance with this board policy , a 16-year-old married girl was denied admission to a junior high school . In reversing a trial court 's judgment , which upheld the board 's policy , the Court of Appeals of Texas overturned the trial court 's decision and ruled against the school board regulation . After citing and agreeing with decisions of the former cases involving the issue , the Court of Appeals made the following declaration :  | The rule adopted by the school board here is in violation of these statutory requirements . Whatever our personal views may be , we conclude the Board was without legal authority to adopt and enforce the rule in question . The rule had the sweeping effect of denying every married student , regardless of the facts or circumstances , at least a portion of a year 's education . The rule takes effect immediately upon marriage . The student then " must withdraw from school for the remainder of the school year " , without regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule is not in conformity with applicable statutes and is unreasonable and arbitrary ( Id . at 390-391 ) . Although pregnancies of high school students , even though married , have presented problems for school boards and officials for many years , it is comparatively recently that the courts have been called upon to determine attendance eligibility policies pertaining to such students . 1 . State v. Chamberlain , 175 N.E.2d 539 ( Ohio 1961 ) . According to the only case in point a school board rule requiring temporary suspension of pregnant married high school students was held by an Ohio court to be valid . The regulation adopted by the Trenton Board of Education read as follows :  | Pregnant students are to withdraw from school attendance immediately upon knowledge of pregnancy . School officials may demand a doctors examination in cases of question ( Id . at 540 ) . The resolution was challenged by a young married pregnant student as being unreasonable , but the court upheld the board resolution which was based on the following alleged factors : the physical well-being of the pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student body ; the possible disruption to the orderly operation of the school 's daily activities ; and the board 's stipulated permission for the student to return to school after the birth of the child . Of the above allegations , the court was most concerned about the regulation 's " purpose to safeguard and protect the pregnant student 's physical condition and well-being . " As the court stated : It is quite evident that the Board 's primary purpose in adopting this regulation was to safeguard and protect the pregnant student whose physical well-being might be endangered as she went about , was subjected to and engaged in the day to day school work and activities ( Id . at 541 ) . The court concluded with the following declaration : It is our opinion that no abuse of discretion has been shown by the Board in the adoption of the regulation here in issue . Said regulation , particularly as it affects the relator herein , is neither unreasonable , arbitrary , nor contrary to law and the Board did not abuse its  | discretion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Id . at 543 ) . Pregnancies in high school became a much more perplexing problem to school officials , as well as the courts , when the pregnancies were associated with increasing numbers of unmarried students . The situation is likely to become worse , as indicated by an authoritative article ( Anastasiow and others , " Educational Implications of Earlier Sexual Maturation , " Phi Delta Kappan , November 1974 , pp. 198-200 ) . Based on careful research , the authors state : Few educators , however , are aware of a dramatic physiological change in young girls that has occurred in the last two decades . The age of menarche has dropped by two years , from 13.5 to 11.5 . In the period from 1870 to 1930 , the mean age of the onset of menstruation fell from 16.5 years of age to 14.5 , a decrease of two years over a 60-year span . In the last 20 years , however , it has dropped the same amount , from 13.5 years in 1950 to a predicted mean age for 1970 of 11.5 . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological sterility that follows .... If we look at the lower extremes of the onset of menarche ( age 8 ) , we find that girls can conceive as early as their tenth or eleventh year . It is in this situation that a true revolution resides : Twenty years ago , if a young girl had sexual relations , the likelihood of her becoming pregnant was low due to  | sterility period , whereas by 1970 , if teen-agers engage in sexual activity , pregnancy is entirely possible . 1 . Perry v. Grenada Municipal Separate School District ( Miss. ) , 300 F. Supp. 748 ( Miss . 1969 ) . In the first applicable case brought before a federal court it was revealed that the school board had denied admission to two young unwed mothers . As a consequence , the girls brought action against the school board with the claim that the school board 's policy of excluding unwed mothers from high school admission violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment . The court agreed with the girls ' complaint , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of district for sole reason that they were unwed mothers ... unless on a fair hearing before the school authorities they were found to be so lacking in moral character that their presence in the schools would taint the education of other students ( Id . at 748-749 ) . Apparently the judicial view is that an unwed mother should have the opportunity of rehabilitation and continue an education for the welfare of the individual as well as society . That judicial view is expressed , with compassion , in the following excerpt : Certainly school officials recognize the importance of education and the effect of a rigid rule which forever bars an individual from obtaining an education .... But after the girl has the child , she should have the  | opportunity for applying for re-admission and demonstrating to the school that she is qualified to continue her education .... Without a high school education , the individual is ill equipped for life , and is prevented from seeking higher education . The court would like to make manifestly clear that lack of moral character is certainly a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that a girl has one child out of wedlock does not forever brand her as a scarlet woman undeserving of any chance for rehabilitation or the opportunity for future education ( Id . at 753 ) . 2 . Ordway v. Hargraves , 323 F. Supp. 1155 ( Mass. 1971 ) . The attendance status of an unwed pregnant girl was the subject of litigation in a 1971 Massachusetts case where the high school principal attempted to carry out a board policy which stipulated that : " Whenever an unmarried girl enrolled in North Middlesex Regional High School shall be known to be pregnant , her membership in the school shall be immediately terminated " ( Id . at 1156 ) . When the pregnancy of the girl was detected she was informed that she could no longer attend regular classes , although she could make use of certain school facilities after formal dismissal time , and attend school functions , such as games , dances and plays . A pertinent point brought out in the testimony is described in the following : It is clear , from the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish plaintiff  | by the school principal or , for that matter , by the school committees . It is equally clear that were plaintiff married , she would be allowed to remain in class during regular school hours despite her pregnancy . Mr. Hargraves made it clear that the decision to exclude plaintiff was not his personal decision , but was a decision he felt required to make in view of the policy of the school committee which he is required to enforce as part of his duties as principal . In response to questioning , Mr. Hargraves could not state any educational purpose to be served by excluding plaintiff from regular class hours , and he conceded that plaintiff 's pregnant condition has not occasioned any disruptive incident nor has it otherwise interfered with school activities ( Id . at 1157 ) . After considering testimony as to the girl 's physical and mental condition , and the effect of her presence in the classroom , the court ordered that she be reinstated in her classes . The rationale for the court 's decision follows : In summary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her attending classes during regular school hours has been shown ; no likelihood that her presence will cause any disruption of or interference with school activities or pose a threat of harm to others has been shown ; and no valid educational or other reason to justify her segregation and to require her to receive a type of educational treatment which is not the equal of that given to all others in her class has been shown .  | It would seem beyond argument that the right to receive a public school education is a basic personal right or liberty . Consequently , the burden of justifying any school rule or regulation limiting or terminating that right is on the school authorities .... On the record before me , respondents have failed to carry this burden ( Id . at 1158 ) . Not only the courts , but some large school systems , also , manifest compassionate consideration for the pregnant teenager . For example , the Baltimore school system has been experimenting successfully with a program of rehabilitation described in an article ( Murray Kappelman , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Pregnant Teenagers , " The Journal of School Health , vol . XLIV , June 1974 , pp. 303-306 . ) The author states : As short a time as six years ago , the pregnant teenager was considered a plague in the City of Baltimore . She was dismissed from school and left to her own devices to secure prenatal care as well as support for her child . Considered to be a social outcast , the teenager had to submit a petition for re-admission to enter school , and then she usually was assigned to an ungraded or vocational classroom ( p. 303 ) . The specialized school , conducted in Baltimore , evidenced an improvement in infant survival , psychological outcomes of the girl , the family , and the teenager 's child .  | It was concluded that : " the ultimate goal is the maximum level of educational achievement possible for the young mother and her successful realization of her responsible , thoughtful , and pleasurable role as a parent " ( p. 306 ) . Houston v. Prosser , 361 F. Supp. 295 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance status of an unmarried mother was in the state of Georgia , where a 15-year-old girl challenged a school policy of denying her readmission to school as a regular daytime student . The policy reads as follows : Any person who marries or is found to have become a parent during the course of his or her public education in the City of Decatur shall not be permitted to continue his or her education in said Decatur School System as a regular daytime student ... ( Id . at 296 ) . Students coming within the scope of this rule shall be entitled to participate in a fully accredited educational program to be taught at night ( Id . at 297 ) . Significantly , tuition and textbooks were provided without charge to daytime students but not to nighttime students . After the facts of the case were heard , the court held that school officials ' policy of excluding plaintiff from regular daytime classes did not penalize her fundamental right of procreation . But the court also held that the policy of requiring plaintiff to pay tuition  | and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , the court finds that defendant 's policy , although fair on its face , denies plaintiff the equal protection of the laws as it is applied ( Id . at 299 ) . Another technique employed by school boards to curb the rate of high school marriages was to deny married students the right to engage in certain school activities ? sometimes referred to as " extracurricular " activities . 1 . Kissick v. Garland Independent School District , 330 S.W.2d 708 ( Tex . 1959 ) . The first applicable case received nationwide attention by students of school law . The case report reveals that Kissick , a football player , sought to restrain enforcement of a board resolution providing that : married students or previously married students be restricted wholly to classroom work ; that they be barred from participating in athletics or other exhibitions , and that they not be permitted to hold class offices or other positions of honor ( Id . at 709 ) . Kissick sought to restrain enforcement of the board resolution , contending that ( 1 ) the resolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ( 2 ) it was violation of public policy in that it penalized marriage . Nevertheless , the Texas  | court upheld the board of education . Apparently it placed considerable weight upon findings of a PTA study indicating " ill effects of married students participating in extra-curricular activities with unmarried students " ( Id . at 710 ) . It is significant that the court was placing full responsibility on the school board for the decision which had inherent legal infirmities . Boards of Education , rather than the Courts , are charged with the important and difficult duty of operating the public schools . So , it is not a question of whether this or that individual judge or court considers a given regulation adopted by the Board as expedient . The Court 's duty , regardless of its personal views , is to uphold the Board 's regulation unless it is generally viewed as being arbitrary and unreasonable . Any other policy would result in confusion detrimental to the progress and efficiency of our public school system ( Id . at 712 ) . 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 103 N.W.2d 569 ( 1960 ) . The assumption that the Kissick case established a precedent that would be followed in other jurisdictions was almost disproved in a Michigan case which involved two boys who married several weeks before the school board adopted a rule that " married students attending school shall not be eligible to participate in any co-curricular activities ? such as competitive sports . " The two boys , who had previously participated in competitive sports , filed a writ of mandamus to compel the school board to admit them to  | the co-curricular activities . After a lower court ruled that the board resolution was legal , the case was appealed to the state supreme court , but before it could be tried there , the two boys graduated . This , of course , made the issue " moot . " Nevertheless , the higher court rendered an " advisory opinion . " The court was evenly divided in reversing and affirming the ruling of the lower court . A statement by one of the judges who believed the regulation to be illegal was a portent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to education , whether a partial denial such as denying the right to participate in extracurricular activities , or a complete denial such as expulsion or suspension , was not a reasonable exercise of authority by a school board or school officials ( Id . at 575 ) . 3 . State v. Stevenson , 189 N.E.2d 181 ( Ohio 1962 ) . Another case resulted from a board regulation which retroactively prohibited a married boy who was a " star " basketball player from continuing to participate in the school 's athletic program . In upholding the board regulation , the court was apparently influenced by a statistical report showing an " alarming " marriage-dropout relationship . The court ignored an opinion of the Attorney General of Ohio who contended that : a board of education may not lawfully adopt a regulation prohibiting married students from participation in extracurricular activities  | promoted by the school as a part of the regular school program . He made the observation that extracurricular activities " have become an integral part of contemporary education " ( Id . at 187 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2d 227 , 381 P.2d 718 ( 1963 ) . Since the courts were not too impressive in upholding school board regulations barring married students from participating in the so-called extracurricular activities , the issue would not rest . For example , a fourth case reaching a state supreme court arose in Utah in 1963 . The factors involved in the case were quite similar to those of the other three cases reported in this category . The court 's ruling was also similar to those in other jurisdictions in that the board 's regulation prohibiting a married boy from participating in the athletic program was legal . As did the other courts , the Utah Supreme Court placed emphasis upon the fact that school boards , and not the courts , are endowed with the power to regulate the schools . Judicial interference would be justified only with evidence of the board 's abuse of discretionary authority . 5 . Board of Directors of Independent School District of Waterloo v. Green , 147 N.W.2d 854 ( Iowa 1967 ) . As the legal precedent was beginning to erode , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education adopted a policy barring married students from participation in extracurricular activities . A high school boy who was a regular player on the basketball team married just before his senior year . In accordance  | with the board policy , he was denied the right to play on the team . The boy sought and obtained an injunction from the District Court preventing enforcement of the rule on the grounds that it " is arbitrary , unreasonable , irrational , unauthorized , irreparably injurious , and he has no adequate remedy at law " ( Id . at 856 ) . The Supreme Court ultimately reversed the decision of the District Court , thereby upholding the board rule barring married students from participating in extracurricular activities . In support of its decision , the Supreme Court stated : " In taking this position we do not stand alone " and cited the preceding cases in this category just discussed . That the precedent would not last was reflected by the dissenting opinions of three of the justices . The reluctance of courts to uphold the school board policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the preceding cases just cited . 6 . Davis v. Meek , 344 F. Supp. 298 ( Ohio 1972 ) . Finally , in 1972 , a federal court made a clean break from the eroding principle set forth by other courts . In this case a high school student and honor student , who was sought by several colleges and major league professional teams , got married despite a rule to the contrary . Four major scouts had talked to him , and at least four colleges had written to him expressing interest in granting him an athletic scholarship .  | In 1970 , the board adopted a resolution that a boy who " contributed to the pregnancy of any girl out of wedlock should be restricted to classes for the year . Normal extracurricular activities might be resumed the following school year . " The following year the policy stated , in part : " B. Married pupils are not permitted to participate in school sponsored extracurricular activities including the Junior-Senior Prom " ( Id . at 299 ) . Nevertheless , the plaintiff student challenged the regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get married , and the rule which deprives him of an important part of the school 's program because of his marriage is an action taken under color of state law which interferes with his civil liberties " ( Id . at 299 ) . The federal court was sympathetic with the Supreme Court of Ohio which : evidences a clear understanding of the notorious fact that the failure rate of teenage marriages is appallingly high .... In the current school year , about seventy per cent of the married students in the Fremont schools have dropped out ( Id . at 300 ) . The United States District Court responded by stating : Nevertheless , the fact remains that the plaintiff did legally get married , without in doing so violating any law of the state . He had thus attained a status where his marital privacy might not be invaded by the state , even  | for the laudable purpose of discouraging other children from doing what he did ( Id . at 300 ) . The court , in ruling for the plaintiff , emphasized the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , an integral and complementary part of the total school program , " and then added : It should also be noted that part of the function of educating children is to provide them with the basic knowledge and training necessary to becoming productive adult citizens .... Hence it is difficult to refute the argument that a secondary school system that deprives a student of the opportunity to develop his full potential for entering the field of professional baseball is not functioning as it should . When this deprivation is not because the system is impoverished or limited in its educational offerings , but is because it desires to use the deprivation as a disciplinary measure in an attempt to attain objectives , however commendable , of doubtful legal validity , the problem becomes somewhat more sharply in focus ( Id . at 301 ) . 7 . Holt v. Shelton , 341 F. Supp. 821 ( Tenn. 1972 ) . The cases referred to thus far in this category concern the barring of married male students from participation in nonclassroom activities . This case refers to the same restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case report , a married high school female student sought and obtained an injunction prohibiting school officials from enforcing a regulation prohibiting her , because she was married , from  | participating in activities and functions offered by the school except for classes in subjects for which credit for graduation was given . The District Court " held that regulation infringed upon married student 's fundamental right to marry , " and added the following and concluding comment : In the case at bar , the regulation which plaintiff is challenging infringes upon her fundamental right to marry by severely limiting her right to an education . The defendants have failed utterly to show that the infringement upon either of these two rights promotes a " compelling " state interest . Indeed , they have failed to show that the regulation in question is even rationally related to ? not to mention " necessary " to promote ? any legitimate state interest at all . Instead , it is apparent that the sole purpose and effect of the regulation is to discourage , by actually punishing , marriages which are perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully consonant with the public policy of that State . It is the opinion of the court that such a regulation is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States in that it impermissibly infringes upon the rights to due process and equal protection of the law of those students who come within its ambit . It is thus the judgment of the court that plaintiff is entitled to the relief she seeks . Accordingly , it is ordered that the preliminary injunction heretofore issued be made permanent ( Id . at 823 ) .  | 8 . O'Neill v. Dent , 364 F. Supp. 565 ( N.Y . 1973 ) . According to a 1973 federal case a student in a military school can not be dismissed for violating a non-marriage regulation such as that of the United States Merchant Marine Academy : A candidate must be unmarried and have never been married . Any cadet who shall marry , or who shall be found to be married , or to have been married before his final graduation shall be required to resign . Refusal to resign will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation , a student disregarded it and was married as indicated in the following paragraphs of the case report : Dennis O'Neill , a 26-year-old midshipman , having completed two years of active duty in the United States Army , entered the United State Merchant Marine Academy in July , 1968 . He would have graduated from the Academy in June of 1972 but he was dismissed on November 8 , 1971 because it was discovered he married after he entered the Academy ( Id . at 566 ) . ... Thereupon O'Neill petitioned this court for declaratory and injunctive relief , to void the Academy regulation as an unconstitutional restriction on his right to marry and to order his reinstatement into the Academy ( Id . at 567 ) . After reviewing marriage regulations in the high school cases referred to above , and lengthy explanations of the Academy officials why the situation  | there was different , the United States District Court ruled in favor of O'Neill and concluded its opinion with the following statement : Finally , the testimony of the Academy officials indicates a pronounced fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop the mind , body and character of prospective officers . Nothing in this opinion requires such a change . Nor is the court called upon to decide whether a less sweeping regulation would be constitutionally acceptable , or whether a regulation predicated upon additional data or evidence showing a substantial difference between the performance of married and unmarried cadets would be invalidated . The court decides only that no such data or evidence has been adduced in this case . Accordingly , the court concludes that Academy Regulation 02120 , Midshipman Regulation 900-45 and 46 violate the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution , and it hereby orders the United States Merchant Marine Academy to award a diploma to Midshipman Dennis O'Neill ( Id . at 580 ) . 9 . Bell v. Lone Oak Independent School District , 507 S.W.2d 636 ( Tex . 1974 ) . This case is to be the last on the issue of barring married students from participation in nonclassroom activities , at the time of this writing . Like the first case , Kissick , it originated in the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision of the court is completely reversed . The present case was instigated by a portion of a board rule which stipulated that :  | The married student can not be elected to an office , or if already elected , must resign ; can not be appointed to an office ; can not participate in athletics , pep squad , class plays , social events such as junior-senior banquet , football banquet , etc . ( Id . at 637 ) . Edward Ray Bell brought suit against the Board of Trustees , seeking a temporary restraining order and injunction against the school and its Board of Trustees to prevent the enforcement of the " married-student rule . " Although the court was reluctant to deal with this issue again , it did so and decided in favor of the student . In doing so , the court said : The quoted rule of Lone Oak Independent School District sets up a classification of individuals to be treated differently from the remainder of the school students without being designed to promote a compelling state interest .... Appellees have not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical or emotional safety and well-being , or any other danger to the students , faculty , or school property , nor any substantial or material danger to the operation of the public schools by allowing married students to participate in athletics . The burden of proof is upon the school district to show that its rule should be upheld as a necessary restraint to promote a compelling state interest . It is the public policy of this state to encourage marriage rather than living together unmarried . To promote that public policy , we have sanctioned by statute the  | marriage ceremony ... and through the years have jealously guarded the bonds of matrimony . It therefore seems illogical to say that a school district can make a rule punishing a student for entering into a status authorized and sanctioned by the laws of this state . We find no logical basis for such rule . We are not unmindful of the decision in Kissick involving a situation similar to the one in this case . There the court held that it was not arbitrary , capricious , discriminatory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other extracurricular activities . Our holding in this case is in direct opposition to Kissick , supra We have chosen not to follow Kissick , because we feel that the rule there should be abandoned for one that is non-discriminatory and which does not violate constitutionally guaranteed rights ... ( Id . at 638 ) . p Although publicity of the " Women 's Liberation Movement " is of comparatively recent origin , the movement for equal educational opportunity had its beginning as soon as public education came into existence . Of course advances were very slow and inconspicuous . In an article ( Kathryn W. Heath , " The Female Equation , " American Education , November 1974 , pp. 20-23 , 29 , 31-32 ) the author depicts the gradual development of women 's rights ? particularly in educational considerations . Brief references are made , in the article , to faint signs of improvement for educational opportunities for women . The first landmark advancement in the drive for women 's rights was the addition to the U. S. Constitution of the 19th Amendment , enfranchising women nationwide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women , but it was one of the last they were to claim at the national level until World War II " ( Id . at 29 ) .  | The author emphasizes the advancement made by the report of the President 's Commission and first effort to produce a composite picture of the status of women for purposes of national policy-making . The report called , for example , for a drastic revision of the structure of education so as to provide for practicable and accessible opportunities , developed with regard to the needs of women , to complete elementary and secondary education school and to continue education beyond high school . As a result of the President 's action , the U. S. Commissioner of Education established , in 1972 , a 12-member Task Force to recommend steps to be taken in order to counter sexist discrimination wherever it may occur . Consequently the NEA , with the Office of Education support , probed the matter of how society and the education system could portray the roles of men and women by observing how differentiations had their beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's groups and their supporters proved successful ? after 49 years of struggle ? in winning endorsement by both houses of the Congress in a joint resolution proposing an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution . " Equality of rights under the law , " it declares , " shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex . " Final action on the resolution calling for the amendment which now is in the hands of the States for ratification , came on March 22 , 1972.  | Three months after that came the Education Amendments of 1972 , a far-reaching act that included a legal blockbuster on behalf of girls and women . With specified exceptions it declared : No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . Since the great majority of schools and colleges do in fact receive such assistance , and want to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying out this act charts a level of change not far from revolutionary " ( Id . at 32 ) . The author concludes with the following statement : From these major legislative advances ? and from other legislative action that is filling in the gaps , from an array of court decisions and consent decrees , and from the vigorous campaign to win ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment ? come the signs that the female equation will one day be brought to balance ( Id . at 32 ) . The battle for absolute equality of the sexes approached fruition , by March , 1972 , when the House and Senate proposed the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification .  | The amendment reads as follows : Section 1 . Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex . Section 2 . The Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article . Section 3 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratification . The significance of the impending constitutional amendment is that it would invalidate all laws ? Federal , state , or local ? that discriminate on the basis of sex . At the time of this writing the proposed amendment has been ratified by 33 of the necessary 38 states . However , two states , Nebraska and Tennessee , have rescinded their ratification , a step that has no clear legal standing . Thus , either five or seven more states are required for ratification . According to newspaper reports , four of the states ? Illinois , Missouri , North Carolina , and North Dakota ? are almost certain to act favorably on the amendment by spring of 1975 . Prospects for favorable action are also anticipated for Arizona , Oklahoma , and Florida . Prospects for ratification are least favorable for Indiana , Nevada , and South Carolina . Another sign that the effort for ratification of the twenty-seventh amendment will meet with success is the support given by President Ford . According to a news item released by the Associated Press , President Ford , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclamation declaring August 26 as Women 's Equality Day and urged the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution . Then , on January 9 , 1975 , the President signed an executive order creating a national commission for the observance of International Women 's Year 1975 . The President said in signing the order that he hopes 1975 will see ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment against sex discrimination . Despite the strong support given by the President and the male members of the State Legislatures , women 's organizations continue their efforts to ensure success . For example , in an article ( Elizabeth A. Greenleaf , " The Responsibility of Educated Women , " The Education Digest , November 1974 pp. 60-61 ) , the author pleads : While there are major concerns for the role and status of women at every level of today 's education , too few educated women are willing to become involved to bring about change . Unless outstanding women educators in every community and at every level of education do become involved , no one else is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on affirmative action , or maintain the advancements that have been made in the past three years . It is essential that every woman educator take stock of her attitudes toward , and her involvement in , the women 's movement of the 1970 's ... ( p. 60 ) .  | The pertinent section of Title IX provides : No person in the United States shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . The impact of this act is described in readable fashion by the assistant executive director for federal relations for the National School Boards Association ( August W. Steinhilber , " Here 's What the Tough New Federal Rules Against Sex Bias Mean for Public Schools , " The American School Board Journal , August 1974 , pp. 20-21 ) . A brief portion of the author 's treatise is quoted as follows : The new regulations were proposed last month by the Department of Health , Education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal Education Amendments of 1972 . Title IX forbids sex bias in the treatment of students and school employees in much the same ways that other federal laws ban discrimination on the basis of a person 's race , religion or nationality . The law banning sex discrimination technically affects only those school districts that now receive federal money in one form or another , but it is clear that H.E.W . plans to interpret the law broadly enough to include virtually all school districts in the country .  | School districts , under the regulations proposed by H.E.W . for implementation late this year , will be required to " remedy " all traces of past sex bias , although H.E.W . has stopped short of mandating quotas or elaborate affirmative action plans . The law ( Title IX ) has been in effect for the past two years , but the federal government will not start enforcing it until its officials review public comments on the proposed regulations , and make needed modifications . Final regulations are expected to be issued late this year , and school districts then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , noncompliance with the regulations could result in the federal government 's initiating court action against an offending school district ( p. 20 ) . The complete text of the proposed regulations is contained in the Federal Register issued June 20 , 1974 . Several of the most pertinent sections of that publication follow : Subpart D. Subpart D concerns the prohibition of discrimination in treatment of students in educational programs and activities . Generally , ? 86.31 ( a ) states that no person shall , on the basis of sex , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of , or be subjected to discrimination under any academic extracurricular , research , occupational training , or other educational program or activity operated by a recipient and which receives no benefits from Federal financial assistance .  | Section 86.34 ( a ) covers access to course offerings and other aspects of a recipient 's educational program or activity . No course offerings may be conducted separately on the basis of sex including health , physical education , industrial arts , business , vocational , technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no student may be required to participate in any course offering on the basis of sex . Section 86.37 provides generally that recipients may not apply rules concerning a student 's actual or potential parental , family , or marital status in a discriminatory manner , and it provides specific prohibitions regarding discrimination against students on account of pregnancy , childbirth , or pregnancy-related disabilities . A student may not be excluded from regular classes because of pregnancy or related conditions unless she so requests or unless her physician certifies that a different arrangement is necessary . The regulation reflects the principle that disabilities related to pregnancy should be treated like any other disability . Section 86.38 imposes requirements concerning physical education and athletic programs , which are integral parts of the educational processes of schools and colleges and are fully subject to the requirements of Title IX . See Brenden v. Independent School District 742 , 477 F.2d 1292 , 1292-96 ( 8th Cir. 1973 ) ; compare Bucha v. Illinois High School Association , 351 F. Supp. 69 ( N.D. Ill. 1972 ) . Section 86.38 ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | be operated without discrimination on the basis of sex . Such activities for which participation or selection is premised on factors other than skill may not be conducted separately on the basis of sex . Athletics for which selection is based on competitive skill may be provided through separate teams for males and females to the extent such teams comply with the requirements of ? 86.38 ( b ) through ( e ) . Section 86.38 ( d ) requires that a recipient make affirmative efforts to provide athletic opportunities in such sports and through such teams as will most effectively equalize opportunities for members of both sexes , and in so doing consider the determinations of student interest made pursuant to ? 86.38(b) . The regulation does not require equal aggregate expenditures for athletics for members of each sex nor equal expenditures for each team ( ? 86.38(e) ) . Section 86.47 ( e ) provides that an employee may not be required to commence leave related to pregnancy so long as her physician certifies that she is capable of performing her duties , and that she must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two weeks after her physician certifies that she is capable of doing so , or in the case of an employee who is a teacher , at the beginning of the first academic term after such certification is made . These rules are consistent with the recent holding of the Supreme Court in Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur , 94 S. Ct . 791 ( 1974 ) . Although LaFleur apparently permits an employer to require that every pregnant  | teacher commence leave " at some firm date during the last few weeks of pregnancy , " Id . at 799 , n. 13 , there is no clear medical evidence as to what such date might be generally appropriate , and the Secretary believes individualized determinations based on the employee 's own capacities should be required instead . In addition to the federal legislation and executive orders that aim to counteract sexual discrimination , there are also state laws that follow the federal lead . Prior to the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act in 1964 , only two states , Hawaii and Wisconsin , had laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional states had passed such legislation . As a result , women can now use state laws as well as federal mandates to eliminate inequities in educational institutions ( Lindley J. Stiles and P. Martin Nystrand , " The Politics of Sex Education , " The Educational Forum , May 1974 ) ( p. 436 ) . The " Inequality in Education " series , published by the Center of Law and Education at Harvard University , features " Sex Discrimination " in its October 1974 issue . In the first article of the publication , Susanne Martinez writes on Litigation Issues . She refers to three cases dealing with " Overt Sex Discrimination . " 1 . Kirstein v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia , 309 F. Supp. 184 ( Va . 1970 ) . In this first case  | " victory came in a challenge to the total exclusion of women from the University of Virginia " where the court " found that the University of Virginia offered educational opportunities unavailable at any other state-supported institution and held that the exclusion of female students from the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Fourteenth Amendment . " 2 . Bray v. Lee , 337 F. Supp. 934 ( Mass. 1972 ) . In this case a school district discriminated on admission standards , claiming they had insufficient physical facilities to accommodate an equal number of girls and boys . The court rejected the district 's argument and held : .. female students seeking admission to the Boston Latin School have been illegally discriminated against solely because of their sex and that discrimination has denied them their constitutional right to an education equal to that offered male students at Latin School ( Id . at 937 ) . 3 . Berkelman v. San Francisco Unified School District , 501 F.2d 1264 ( 9th Cir. 1974 ) . In this case , a district court 's ruling was reversed by the Ninth Circuit which held " . . . the use of higher admissions standards for female than for male applicants to Lowell High School violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment " ( Id . at 1270 ) . Martinez places emphasis on the exclusion of women in which there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . She cites three cases that show that : successful challenges were made to the exclusion of female students from auto shop , work shop and metal shop classes . In each case , the respective school districts yielded before final judgment and consent decrees were entered . The school district 's inability to defend the discriminatory practices involved in the litigations is indicative of the lack of legal justification for those policies . Nevertheless , similar discriminatory assignment of students to vocational programs continues to exist unchallenged in many school districts . The real problem in vocational education is not that of the exclusion of women . . . but the mere insidious counseling and tracking of female students into " acceptable " vocational programs . The adoption and implementation of the H.E.W . anti-sex discrimination guidelines will undoubtedly eliminate overt barriers to women in vocational classes ( p. 6-7 ) . Textbooks typified by the Dick and Jane readers to medical school anatomy texts have been criticized for portraying women in a biased , stereotyped manner . In a study of government texts , Jennifer Macleod and Sandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . Women are rarely mentioned in the texts . The authors of the study found that the texts failed to discuss individual women , to quote women , to include  | a reasonable number of women in illustrations and to use women 's case histories as examples . 2 . Illustrations and texts were often condescending and perpetuated stereotyped roles . The authors found numerous examples of undesirable stereotypes concerning women and women 's roles . For example , women in the texts were " often defined as their husband 's wives rather than as individuals in their own right ; sometimes women were dehumanized as sex objects . " 3 . Finally , the texts ignored much of the subject matter dealing with women . For example , they rarely mentioned famous women , women 's suffrage or a women 's movement ( Jennifer Macleod and Sandra Silverman , " You Wo n't Do : What Textbooks on U. S. Government Teach High School Girls , " Know , Inc. , Pittsburgh , 1973 ) . In another publication ( D. Dean Cantrell , " Masters and Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 36-37 ) the author criticizes the manner in which the English language belittles females : Out of the recent montage of feminist materials emerges a lucid demonstration of the egregious way in which the English language has been notoriously favorite to the male species . The language has worked with remarkable success in making it possible for the man to perpetuate himself as master , to foster the illusion that women are dependent , and , in fact , to subjugate women . It is undeniable , for example , that man , master , and father , not women , mistress , and mother , are  | commonplaces for leadership designations ( p. 36 ) . When one considers how fertile man has been in devising alternative terms to women ? chicks , dolls , dames , babes , one realizes how the language has worked to abuse and dehumanize women ... ( p. 37 ) . The list of books and articles , and particularly textbooks , that adversely stereotyped females could go on and on . However , just one more is referred to here . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Office of Education ) the author discusses ways in which the proposed DHEW regulations based in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 could be implemented : A similar spirit is inherent in the way the regulations would deal with the sex stereotyping often found in textbooks , in which the boys are characteristically portrayed as self-reliant problem-solvers and the girls as inept homebodies . The regulations do not say that such textbooks must be discarded , there being a constitutional issue involved here . They do suggest , however , that local school districts find their own way of dealing with sex-biased texts . In addition DHEW will increase its efforts to provide assistance and guidance to local education agencies that have determined to eliminate sex bias from the curriculum and from educational materials they use ... . A study of 144 elementary school textbooks made by the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women ( NOW )  | showed that boys were the focus of 881 stories , whereas only 344 of the stories centered around girls . Similarly , adult males were featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 131 biographies of famous men , 23 of women . Time after time , the report declared girls were portrayed as passive , dependent and incompetent ; boys as active , self-reliant , and successful ( p. 7 ) . Sex stereotyping in textbooks is similarly criticized in an article by Weitzman and Rizzo , " Sex Bias in Textbooks , " Today 's Education ( official publication of the NEA ) , January-February , 1975 , pp. 49 , 52 . In conclusion the authors state : While we must all create pressure to change the textbooks , in the meantime , it is up to teachers to counteract the latent messages in them and to create positive images of adult women in the minds of students ( p. 52 ) . Some of the most important publishers of textbooks are aware of the manner in which textbooks and other materials have stereotyped the sexes , adversely to females , and have taken it upon themselves to remedy the situation . For example , McGraw-Hill Book Company , one of the most prestigious publishers of textbooks , has prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the guidelines are significantly stated , and the company has given permission to reproduce them , they are quoted at length as follows :  | 1 . a . Though many women will continue to choose traditional occupations such as homemaker or secretary , women should not be type-cast in these roles but shown in a wide variety of professions and trades : as doctors and dentists , not always as nurses ; as principals and professors , not always as teachers ; as lawyers and judges , not always as social workers ; as bank presidents , not always as tellers ; as members of Congress , not always as members of the League of Women Voters . b . Similarly , men should not be shown as constantly subject to the " masculine mystique " in their interests , attitudes , or careers . They should not be made to feel that their self-worth depends entirely upon their income level or the status level of their jobs . They should not be conditioned to believe that a man ought to earn more than a woman or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . c . An attempt should be made to break job stereotypes for both women and men . No job should be considered sex-typed , and it should never be implied that certain jobs are incompatible with a woman 's " femininity " or a mans " masculinity . " Thus , women as well as men should be shown as accountants , engineers , pilots , plumbers , bridge-builders , computer operators , TV repairers , and astronauts , while men as well as women should be shown as nurses , grade-school teachers , secretaries , typists , librarians , file clerks , switchboard operators , and baby-sitters . Women within a profession should be shown at all professional levels , including the top levels . Women should be portrayed in positions  | of authority over men and over other women , and there should be no implication that a man loses face or that a woman faces difficulty if the employer or supervisor is a woman . All work should be treated as honorable and worthy of respect ; no job or job choices should be downgraded . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were available to them when work was stereotyped by sex . d . Books designed for children at the preschool , elementary , and secondary levels should show married women who work outside the home and should treat them favorably . Teaching materials should not assume or imply that most women are wives who are also fulltime mothers , but should instead emphasize the fact that women have choices about their marital status , just as men do : that some women choose to stay permanently single and some are in no hurry to marry ; that some women marry but do not have children , while others marry , have children , and continue to work outside the home . Thus , a text might say that some married people have children and some do not , and that sometimes one or both parents work outside the home . Instructional materials should never imply that all women have a " mother instinct " or that the emotional life of a family suffers because a woman works . Instead they might state that when both parents work outside the home there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance on day-care centers , nursery schools , or other help . According to Labor Department statistics for  | 1972 , over 42 per cent of all mothers with children under 18 worked outside the home , and about a third of these working mothers had children under 6 . Publications ought to reflect this reality . Both men and women should be shown engaged in home maintenance acitivities , ranging from cooking and housecleaning to washing the car and making household repairs . Sometimes the man should be shown preparing the meals , doing the laundry , or diapering the baby , while the woman builds bookcases or takes out the trash. e . Girls should be shown as having , and exercising , the same options as boys in their play and career choices . In school materials , girls should be encouraged to show an interest in mathematics , mechanical skills , and active sports , for example , while boys should never be made to feel ashamed of an interest in poetry , art , or music , or an aptitude for cooking , sewing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both sexes . For example , home economics courses should apply to boys as well as girls , and shop to girls as well as boys . Both males and females should be shown in textbook illustrations depicting career choices . When as a practical matter it is known that a book will be used primarily by women for the life of the edition ( say , the next five years ) , it is pointless to pretend that the readership is divided equally between males and females . In such cases it may be more beneficial to address the book fully to women and exploit every opportunity ( 1 ) to point out to them a broader  | set of options than they might otherwise have considered , and ( 2 ) to encourage them to aspire to a more active , assertive , and policymaking role than they might otherwise have thought of . f . Women and girls should be portrayed as active participants in the same proportion as men and boys in stories , examples , problems , illustrations , discussion questions , text items , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be stereotyped in examples by being spoken of only in connection with cooking , sewing , shopping , and similar activities . 2. a . Members of both sexes should be represented as whole human beings with human strengths and weaknesses , not masculine or feminine ones . Women and girls should be shown as having the same abilities , interests , and ambitions as men and boys . Characteristics that have been traditionally praised in males ? such as boldness , initiative , and assertiveness ? should also be praised in females . Characteristics that have been praised in females ? such as gentleness , compassion , and sensitivity ? should also be praised in males . b . Like men and boys , women and girls should be portrayed as independent , active , strong , courageous , competent , decisive , persistent , serious-minded , and successful . They should appear as logical thinkers , problem-solvers , and decision makers . They should be shown as interested in their work , pursuing a variety of career goals , and both  | deserving of and receiving public recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quiet and passive , or fearful and indecisive , or illogical and immature . Similarly , women should sometimes be shown as tough , aggressive , and insensitive . Stereotypes of the to ical , objective male and the emotional , subjective female are to be avoided . In descriptions , the smarter , braver , or more successful person should be a woman or girl as often as a man or boy . In illustrations , the taller , heavier , stronger , or more active person should not always be male , especially when children are portrayed . 3 . Women and men should be treated with the same respect , dignity , and seriousness . Neither should be trivialized or stereotyped , either in text or in illustrations . Women should not be described by physical attributes when men are being described by mental attributes or professional position . Instead , both sexes should be dealt with in the same terms . References to a man 's or a woman 's appearance , charm , or intuition should be avoided when irrelevant . It is generally agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that which operates against girls and women who desire to participate in competitive sports . One of the most comprehensive , legalistic and welldocumented treatises on the subject is written by  | Richard Alan Rubin , " Sex Discrimination in Interscholastic High School Athletics , " Syracuse Law Review , Spring 1974 , pp. 535-574 . In his introductory paragraph he writes : From the college coed to the 10-year-old longing to play little league baseball , American women have been consistently denied adequate athletic opportunities . Funding , coaching , scheduling , scholarships and accessibility to facilities identify only a few of the areas of inequity . Recently , however , female athletes have begun to attack various exclusionary and discriminatory practices ? particularly in high schools ( Id . at 535 ) . Also , Martinez , supra , in the Harvard publication writes on the issue of " athletics " in Sex Discrimination as follows : The greatest proliferation of sex litigation in education has surrounded that long-standing practice of excluding or discriminating against female students in athletic programs . Women have routinely been denied the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucrative college scholarships and opportunities . In other instances where women are permitted to compete , their teams are often financed by candy sales while the male athletic teams are supported by generous allocations in the school budget . The existing structure of providing impressive athletic programs for male students while providing female students with  | either no programs or token programs is highly vulnerable to legal challenge . Challenges to such discrimination have generally fared well in the courts , particularly where the athletic competition involved is a non-contact sport such as skiing or golfing and where there is no program at all for women students . Some courts , however , have suggested that a separate but equal athletic program would find judicial approval ... ( p. 7-8 ) . Innumerable articles have been written in prose depicting the plight of high school girls who wish to participate in competitive sports . It is also set to verse in " The Ballad of Katie Schilly " as quoted in the Syracuse Law Review , supra ( at 542 ) . The story begins with a young Katie Schilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes , she hurdles , she capers the mile , But what she does best is in cross-country style . Because of her stamina , fleetness and grace , She covets a spot in the cross-country race In Central New York for Central Square High , To help them to win , or at least to a tie . She 's physically fit for the slated position , The doctors admit she 's in tip-top condition But a strange inadvertence has set up a hex ? For by " Commissioner 's Regs " she was born the wrong sex . We come to the heart of the issue before us , An issue so simple it might even bore us : Katie may ski with men , mile after mile ; She may run on a track coeducational style :  | The double A U allows women to run In heats of ten miles at the sound of a gun . So a ban on cross-country is not physiological , Our ruling is therefore a trifle illogical . In this season so jolly , with wassail and yuling , I humbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfairness , a latent hostility , Let 's judge , not by sex , but by patent ability . Lengthy treatment of all the written arguments on the relative physical abilities of the male and female , and the many court cases regarding the rights of girls to participate in the various competitive sports is beyond the scope of this publication . Moreover , with the final adoption of the proposed rules under Title IX of the Education Amendments , the issue will , in general , be settled . Of course much more litigation may be expected on certain provisions which are not clear . References to just several of the most recent and precedential court decisions are made to indicate present judicial reaction on the issues involved . 1 . Brenden v. Independent School District 742 , 342 F. Supp. 1224 ( Minn. 1972 ) . The facts of this case indicate two girls who desired to participate in certain sports offered at their respective schools were denied the right to do so . Peggy Brenden , an eighteen-year-old senior , desired to become a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered " an excellent woman tennis player . " The tennis program open to girls was inadequate to meet her aspirations .  | Tony St. Pierre , a seventeen-year-old junior , desired to become a member of the boys ' cross-country and cross-country skiing teams at her school . She was considered " an excellent young athlete . " There was no cross-country program for girls at her school . Both girls were informed that they could not participate on the boys ' teams " because of a rule of the Minnesota High School League preventing participation by girls on boys ' interscholastic athletic teams " ( Id . at 1227 ) . The girls won their suit as indicated by the following statement of the court : In summary , the court is confronted with a situation where two high school girls wish to take part in certain interscholastic boys ' athletics ; ... and where there are no alternative competitive programs sponsored by their schools which would provide an equal opportunity for competition for these girls ; and where the rule , in its application , becomes unreasonable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brought to its base , then , Peggy Brenden and Tony St. Pierre are being prevented from participating on the boys interscholastic teams in tennis , cross-country , and cross-country skiing solely on the basis of the fact of sex and sex alone . The Court is thus of the opinion that in these factual circumstances , the application of the League rules to Peggy Brenden and Tony St. Pierre is arbitrary and unreasonable , in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . For this reason , the  | application of the rule to these two girls can not stand ... ( Id . at 1234 ) . 2 . Gilpin v. Kansas State High School Activities Association , Inc. , 377 F. Supp. 1233 ( Kansas 1974 ) . In this case " a civil rights suit was brought by a female high school student who claimed deprivation of equal protection due to state high school activities association 's rule which was claimed to have prevented plaintiff from participating in cross-country competition solely on the basis of sex " ( Id . at 1233 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention , with the following declaration : ... the practical effect of the Association 's rule prohibiting mixed competition is not merely to prevent Tammie Gilpin 's participation on a oys ' cross-country team , but rather to completely bar her from participating in crosscountry competition . Rather than contributing to the advancement of girls ' interscholastic competition , the rule acts to totally deprive Tammie Gilpin of the opportunity to compete at all , solely on the basis of her sex . Thus , although the Association 's overall objective is commendable and legitimate , the method employed to accomplish that objective is simply over-broad in its reach . It is precisely this sort of overinclusiveness which the Equal Protection Clause disdains ( Id . at 1243 ) . The primary relief sought by the plaintiff is injunctive . In light of the Court 's determination that the Kansas State High School Activities Association 's rule prohibiting mixed competition is unconstitutional as applied to this particular plaintiff , such relief  | is clearly appropriate . Accordingly , it is ordered that Tammie Gilpin be permitted to compete on the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State High School Activities Association is enjoined from imposing any sanction or penalty from Southeast High School for complying with this Court 's order , and it is similarly enjoined from imposing any sanction or penalty upon any other high school for engaging in interscholastic competition with Southeast High School ( Id . at 1243 ) . 3 . National Organization for Women , Essex County Chapter v. Little League Baseball , Inc. , 127 N.J. Super . 522 , 318 A.2d 33 ( 1974 ) . This case developed from a complaint of violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination ? and particularly against the provision prohibiting girls from playing baseball in the " Little League . " The defense by Little League , in essence , was that because of physical differences between the sexes , girls as a class , were more prone to injury than were boys when playing with a hard ball . After considerable evidence was produced on both sides of this issue , the hearing officers held that : " Little League had not borne its burden of establishing that girls of 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same age group as to preclude them as a class from competing as safely and successfully as boys in the game " ( Id . at 35 ) . A significant acknowledgment was " that some girls would have the skill to play baseball with boys , and he  | testified that Little League has various leagues graded according to the ability of the player , so that girls could be rated to play with their peers of either sex " ( Id . at 36 ) . The court upheld the order to " admit girls 8 to 12 to participation in their baseball programs conducted in this State " ( Id at 35 ) . With respect to both the physiological and psychological aspects of the issue the court declared : We conclude there was substantial credible evidence in the record to permit the Division to find as a fact that girls of ages 8-12 are not as a class subject to a materially greater hazard of injury while playing baseball than boys of that age group . . . . Thus the factor of safety does not militate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably restricts participation in it at the 8-12 age level to boys . We regard the psychological testimony on both sides as too speculative to rest any fact-finding on it . In any case , we are clear that there is no substantial psychological basis in the record to warrant a conclusion that the game is reasonably restricted to boys in this age bracket , as against the evident statutory policy against sex discrimination in place of public accommodation ( Id at 36-37 ) .  | There is great variability in our society regarding views toward divulging sex information . Home background and religious scruples appear to be the most potent factors in determining the variation in attitudes . Because of the conflicting views , " sex " is a subject which many writers are reluctant to discuss . Educators , in particular , are fearful to treat the issue lest they offend some school patrons whose financial and moral support are necessary for maintaining the school system . The judicial view , however , supports free expression by teachers and others on sexual matters , as expressed by a judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is a fact of life " and " is so much a part of our society that its discussion should not be made a crime . " An objective of this publication is to determine the extent to which the public schools are involved in the " sexual revolution " of the present decade . It is proposed that the church , the home and the school should all assume some responsibility in  | adjusting to the revolution . It is the judiciary , however , that determines the extent to which sexual innovations are constitutionally permissible . Therefore , the understanding of court decisions on sexual issues related to the schools is of utmost concern to school officials , school personnel , and parents of school children . Despite the title of the book , it appeared necessary to give attention to articles written by recognized authorities in their respective fields . Their comments are frequently controversial and often lead to litigation . Moreover , the various acts of the Congress pertaining to sexuality in the schools necessitate some treatment . Obviously the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , in its present status , is referred to . But in all probability the interpretation of the proposals made with respect to it will cause much litigation for years to come . Contrasting views and attitudes with respect to the propriety and necessity of " sex education " could be greatly resolved if a common understanding of its meaning were accepted by all . The most comprehensive  | definition of sex education this author was able to find is contained in the Michigan laws which reads : Sex education is the preparation for personal relationships between the sexes by providing appropriate educational opportunities designed to help the individual develop understanding , acceptance , respect and trust for himself and others . Sex education includes the knowledge of physical , emotional and social growth and maturation and understanding of the individual needs . It involves the examination of man 's and woman 's roles in society , how they relate and react to supplement each other , the responsibilities of each towards the other throughout life and the development of responsible use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many persons believe sex education is a proper function of the home . Unfortunately , however , the home has , in general , failed woefully in providing youths with the necessary information they need about sex during their dev elopmental years . Consequently sex information is most frequently provided by peers , which is often misleading and detrimental . Since the value of sex education , as provided by peers , parents , social services , and religious groups is limited , the responsibility falls most appropriately on the public schools where its value will accrue to all youth .  | An abundance of written material is available to school authorities who seek information for incorporating a program of sex education in the curriculum . Numerous publications , authored by experts in their fields , offer guidelines which may be helpful . Also , a voluntary , non-profit organization called " Sex Information and Education Council of the United States ( SIECUS ) " has acted in a consultative capacity in initiating and maintaining worthwhile programs of sex education . Despite the seemingly-valid arguments for incorporating sex education in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections ? based mostly on religious grounds . Consequently the issue has been carried to the courts for settlement . At least seven cases on the issue have been adjudicated in courts of record during the past decade . In virtually all instances the courts have been in agreement that sex education is legal within legislative limitations . The main issue of litigation concerns the compulsory aspects of a sex education program . This is usually resolved by an " excusal " provision which permits those whose parents object to absent themselves from the instruction .  | There are some persons ? including the author ? who believe certain aspects of the sex education program should be compulsory for all children . Many programs of sex education contain " birth control " as an element of instruction . Not until 1974 , however , has it been isolated as a single issue for litigation . In the only case to date on the issue the United States Supreme Court held : Michigan 's statutory prohibitions against teaching of birth control in public schools do not infringe upon First Amendment right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Michigan statute had been harmful or caused problems in the teaching of matters directed and authorized by the state , a different decision might have been rendered . " Homosexuality " means sexual desire or behavior directed toward a person or persons of one 's own sex . It has been in existence for centuries without judicial disapproval . Only in recent years , however , has it constituted a litigious issue as applied to school teachers . In general the courts are in agreement that " homosexuality , " in itself , does not constitute  | " immorality " and is therefore not just cause for dismissal of a teacher . The judicial consensus appears to be that unless one 's sexual idiosyncrasies , such as homosexuality , interfere with the proper conduct and morale of the school , a teacher whose teaching efficiency is not impaired can not be legally dismissed nor have a teaching certificate revoked . There are no clear cut legal principles which determine whether or not a teacher is subject to dismissal because of adulterous or other illicit acts . It depends upon certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the classroom is not cause for dismissal if the teacher 's reputation is not tarnished sufficiently to cause public resentment and disapproval . If , however , a teacher 's sexual conduct , in or out of the school , is such that it establishes harmful teacher-student relations , a school board would be upheld by the court if the offending teacher were dismissed . Mere suspicion of sexual misconduct is not justification for termination of a teacher 's contract . Actual facts are necessary . The most repugnant act of sexual misbehavior in the eyes of the public is " oral copulation . " The act is especially incriminating when performed in public view .  | In all the cases cited on this issue , the courts have upheld the boards of education in the dismissal of teachers for such an act which is " indicative of corruption , and indecency , depravity , dissoluteness , and shamelessness . " The flimsy argument of teachers who are guilty of the indecent act in public , and claim it does not affect their teaching efficiency , does not deter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although " transsexualism " has been common for many years , there is only one case reported by a court of record where a teacher has been involved . In this case a male teacher who underwent sex-reassignment surgery to change his external anatomy to that of a female was dismissed from his teaching position on the ground that his retention would result in harm to students . The court upheld the board 's dismissal of the teacher despite his proven ability to perform his ( or her ) teaching functions efficiently . The court concluded the teacher 's presence in the classroom would " create a potential for psychological harm to the students . " The last of the so-called " bizarre " cases referred to was more ludicrous than relevant . The case involved a male sixth grade teacher who was dismissed for public " conduct unbecoming a teacher " by displaying and fondling , in public view , a mannequin . The teacher objected to the dismissal because his se-:ual actions were unrelated to his teaching performance which was rated as excellent . Moreover , he argued he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The  | court 's adverse reactions to those arguments are described in the last section of Chapter 3 . In brief " obscenity " is considered to be that which corrupts the public morale by indecency . For the purpose of this publication obscenity is that which tends to stir the sex impulses or leads to sexually impure and lustful thoughts and lowers the standards of right and wrong especially as related to sex relations . The difficulty in judging what is illegally obscene today is that social standards are so remotely different from what they were decades ago . Our ancestors would have been shocked by expressions which are commonplace today . The task of the English teacher , who insists on the exercise of academic freedom , is hazardous . Care must be taken to refrain from using reading materials that contain words or phrases which might be objectionable and offensive to certain school patrons . As one writer states : Parents continue to be afraid ? in rather vague ways ? of the possible effects of " dirty " or " subversive " books on their children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contemporary literature into  | his classes often does so at the risk of losing his job . The great majority of court cases dealing with alleged obscenities in teaching evolve from the use of the " fourlettered word " meaning sexual intercourse . Of the several applicable court cases referred to in this publication , the courts are in agreement that the treatment of sex information is condoned if the purpose has a worthy and wholesome motive . In contrast , however , a teacher is not likely to have judicial support by referring to sexual matters before students in a manner that is irrelevant , oppressive and degrading . In addition to court decisions regarding obscenities of teachers there are several reported cases where attempts have been made to curb obscenities by pupils . One case is reported where a teacher permitted students to use the most flagrant obscenities , on an experimental plan of self-expression . The court exonerated the teacher for her honest attempt to improve the bad situation in her school and thereby overturned the board 's action in dismissing her . But in another case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who required two young girls to write a vulgar four-lettered word 1,000 times in an  | attempt to curb the use of obscenities by pupils . Despite the defendant 's claim to academic freedom , the court rightfully held that the teacher did not have the right , under the principle of academic theory , to require an eleven-year-old girl to write the very vulgar word even once where no valid purpose could conceivably be served . Poor judgment was the teacher 's downfall . Many schools are presently being challenged and censored for permitting the use of textbooks containing alleged obscenities . The most glaring evidence of the harmful effects of self-appointed censors deciding on the reading materials to be used in the public schools is indicated by the shameful proceedings occurring in the textbook disputes in West Virginia as described in Chapter 4 . Educationally it will be a giant step backward when professionally qualified teachers are denied the responsibility and right to choose when , what and where certain teaching materials should be used in the educational process . Although there is no more a legal question regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue are cited to indicate the radical judicial change that has taken place over the past half century .  | Now , in schools , as well as elsewhere , contracts in restraint of marriage are void because they are contrary to public policy . In the first case recorded on this issue , an unwed pregnant teacher was successful in a dismissal suit , where the board dismissed her on an " immoral " charge . Ignoring the charge of " immorality " the court upheld the teacher on her right of privacy in sexual matters such as deciding " to bear or beget a child . " That this issue has not been permanently resolved is evidenced by the strong dissent from the court 's decision where the dissenting judge expressed an opinion that the public rumors resulting from her premarital sexual behavior could be injurious to the morale of the school system . In subsequent cases the court has held the immorality charge against an unwed pregnant teacher has no bearing on her teaching ability and effectiveness . Heretofore school boards have arbitrarily determined the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But recently some pregnant teachers have taken exception to the undue length of time required for maternity leave ? particularly when it was without pay . Litigation on the issue reached a climax when , in 1974 , a teacher was advised by her doctor that she could  | safely continue working up until the child was born and could resume work two weeks after giving birth . The rule of the board required that a pregnant teacher must go on leave three months prior to the expected birth and to continue to the end of the school year during which the leave was granted . The teacher ignored the rule which she considered to be unreasonable and discriminatory to women and continued teaching until within a month of the birth of her child and resumed teaching again as soon as her doctor thought permissible . The court agreed that the lengthy maternity leave , as defined by the board , was " unreasonable , unconstitutional and therefore invalid . " Finally , the issue of mandated maternity leaves for extended periods of time reached the United States Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The high court ruled that the public school maternity leave regulations directly affect " one of the basic civil rights of man . " In the first case of its kind a sociology professor applied for a " parental leave " to take care of his new born son . After his application was denied he took action in challenging the constitutionality of the maternity leave provisions . He claimed that by so discriminating against men who seek to fully participate in the care of their  | children the school was denying them the right to play a full and equal role in their families . A motion to strike the complaint was denied by the judge who held " the complaint stated a good cause for action . " As the stereotyping of the sexes continues to wane , more cases of this type may be anticipated . Litigation on this issue was of short duration . The early court ruling was that marriage emancipates a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal precedent has been adhered to through the years , but with the increase of earlier marriages it may again be an issue of litigation . Prohibiting married girls from attending school was so forcefully declared illegal by the courts , that it is no longer an issue of litigation . Some school systems adopted regulations which temporarily suspended married girls from attendance because of the school principal 's statements that confusion and disorder usually occurred immediately after marriage . Although the court looked askance at  | the school regulation , it refused to rule against the " professional " judgments of the school administrators . The issue of temporarily suspending pregnant married students was first adjudicated in 1961 , where a board policy required immediate withdrawal of a married student who was known to be pregnant . Although the board resolution was challenged by a young married pregnant student as being unreasonable , the court upheld the board resolution ? mainly for the physical well-being of the pregnant student and also for the possible adverse effect upon the morale of the student body . In the first applicable case on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's policy of excluding them from school attendance as a violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment . In upholding the girls ' complaints the court held they could not be excluded from school attendance unless " they were found to be so lacking in moral character that their presence in the school would taint the education of other students . " The court expressed the opinion that exclusion from school attendance would deprive them of the  | opportunity for rehabilitation and for seeking higher education . Ever since the first case on this issue ( Kissick ) the courts have vacillated with respect to the legality of barring students from nonclassroom activities merely because of marriage . In subsequent cases , the courts have placed the responsibility for such rulings on the school boards , with intimations that they ( the courts ) were not in agreement with the propriety of the prohibitive provisions . As the early legal precedent set by Kissick began to erode , the judiciary finally made a clean break by declaring unconstitutional a board policy prohibiting student participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the court is worthy of mention here as a legal precedent for all school boards to follow in dealing with the issue : We have chosen not to follow Kissick , because we feel that the rule there should be abandoned for one that is non-discriminatory and which does not violate constitutionally guaranteed rights . The movement towards women 's rights has been a  | long and arduous one . A real landmark achievement did not come until August 18 , 1920 , when the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified . It reads : The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex . Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation . Although this Amendment was far-reaching toward equalizing rights for women , it did not produce great gains in attaining educational opportunities . Another giant step toward equality for women came in 1972 when Congress proposed the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amendment reads as follows : Section 1 . Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex . Section 2 . The Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation , the provisions of this article . Section 3 . This Amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification .  | The significance of the pending constitutional amendment is that it would invalidate all laws ? Federal , state , or local ? that discriminate on the basis of sex . Despite promising success of ratification , women 's organizations are intensifying their effort to bring about success . That effort is now nationwide as indicated in a statement by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim of the United Nations when on January 16 , 1975 , he stated : Despite the advances of the past 30 years , discrimination against women remains a pervasive fact of life in many countries and thus represents a major obstacle to real social , economic and political progress in the world . Women 's organizations by themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be pointed out that without the support of man , success of ratification would be impossible . After all , approximately one-half of the voting population is comprised of males . From the standpoint of equal educational opportunities for women , there is nothing more that ratification of ERA could do than Title IX is proposed to do ? provided it is implemented with proposals that will be finalized and enforced .  | Already the provisions of Title IX have resulted in court decisions which have invalidated rules and practices of educational institutions which have operated against females . It can be safely anticipated that much more litigation will follow because of the difficulties that will be encountered in the interpretation of certain provisions . One of the most glaring inequities of the sexes is the deprivation of educational opportunity for women . This is particularly noticeable in vocational education where women are excluded by recruiting practices and admissions from areas such as auto shop , shop work , and metal shop work . It is assumed and hoped that the implementation of the HEW anti-discrimination guidelines will remove barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to indicate the discriminatory influence the various textbooks have had on females . The sharp criticisms contained in numerous articles about the discriminatory practices are no longer necessary . The most prominent publishers have already provided guidelines to eliminate the practices of stereotyping the sexes adversely to the female . McGraw-Hill Book Company , especially , has done much to propose guidelines . They are quoted at some length in this publication .  | From the standpoint of articles and court cases , the discrimination against females in sports has received the greatest amount of publicity . When and if the proposed rules under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 are finalized the issue will be generally settled . However , much more litigation on certain provisions , as well as on unforeseen future developments may be anticipated . At any rate athletics ( formerly considered the males ' domain ) will never be the same again . Ability rather than sex will determine eligibility in noncontact sports . It is even conceivable that in contact sports some big husky women would be recruited as guards and tackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race discrimination , it was frequently said that we should be " color blind " in considering the Negroes ' role in society . It can not be said , however , that in the elimination of sex discrimination we must be " sex blind " ? a fact for which many men , and women too , are grateful .
