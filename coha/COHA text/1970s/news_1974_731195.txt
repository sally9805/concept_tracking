txt A fiery sun had just peeked over the trees on Kent Island when the Sigsbee 's mainsail billowed and her dredges splashed , port and starboard , into the icy blue Chesapeake water . It was not going to be a good day , but Wadie Murphy did n't know that yet . Over his head the massive canvas sail bellied full . Almost imperceptibly the Sigsbee heeled and her rigging pulled taut under the cold morning breeze as the dredges took their bite and foam hissed along the boat 's old wooden hull . " I druther drudge when It 's a good breeze , you got a good crew and they 's orsters. to catch , than anything , " he had ' said in the dialect of a bay waterman . " But you get a bad crew or no breeze or no orsters , an ' it 's awful . " AT 32 , WADE H. Murphy Jr . is the new generation of a dying breed . Armed with honed skills soon to be obsolete , he skippers one of an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the last commercial fleet still under sail in the United States . Sigsbee was built in 1901 . She is 47 feet long , not counting her proud 16-foot ornamented bowsprit . Her single pine-tree of a mast soars 62 feet from the waterline . Fully loaded she can carry 350 bushels of oysters , far more than the 150-bushel limit . Ranging 36 to 60 feet long , skipjacks were the workhorses of the bay , built " by eyeball and guesstimate " without the aid of marine blueprints but ' all sharing similarities far greater than their subtle differences . At the peak of their era around- 1900 , there were about 2,000 of them ; 16 years , ago when Murphy went on the water there were 54 , last year there were 36 , and this year 28 . STILL THOSE 28 graceful and hardy skip . jacks , most built around the turn of the century , take on new interest as short fuel supplies pinch tighter among the several hundred power boat oystermen on the Chesapeake , one of the nation 's richest sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 1865 Maryland conservation law that prohibited dredging oysters under power . Since dredging is more efficient than the other method ? lifting them from one spot at a time using tongs  --  dredging remained profitable even under sail . Seven years ago the state gave in a little , allowing skipjacks to dredge on Mondays and Tuesdays using power in the form of a tiny pushboat with a big automobile engine carried outboard of the stern . While powerboat oystermen may burn 25 to 30 gallons of gasoline catching their 25-bushel limit , a skipjack under sail may catch 150 bushels and burn only 15 gallons a day in her winch motor and hurrying to her worksite . STILL THE BOATS are big and old ' had expensive to maintain . They depend on weather far more than power boats , and they are heavily outnumbered by powerboat men whose influence with Maryland government to limit dredging areas grows year by year . It was pitch black when Sigsbee slipped alone out of Knapps Narrows and into the open bay . An hour later a shout and a gesture from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails , haul the pushboat out of the water , and ready the dredges . In an instant Sigsbee was silently working in short drags back and forth while Murphy sensed the direction and force of , the wind , judged the paying out of the steel dredge lines , and visualized the shape of the oyster bar below . Soon two more skipjacks appeared on the horizon , to be followed by another and yet another , all of whom went to work on the same bar . " THAT GUY FOLLOWS me wherever I go , " Murphy said without emotion . " I get out and start working a place and he shows up every time . He saw which way I went . " After a pause : " I know a place better than this , but you do n't go there right away or they 'll all come with you . . better let ' em get settled down here awhile . " It was a long way from the tough , independent , and fiercely competitive skippers of last century who are said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oyster wars on the bay , even to boarding a police sloop , setting her crew ashore and dismantling the boat . A tug on the throttle of a motor mounted amidships signaled a crewman to engage a clutch and the winches turned , hauling in dredges full of stones , oyster shells , debris , mud , and ? oysters . In one deity movement four crewmen emptied two dredges , one on each side , quickly tossing the oysters fore and aft and shoveling the debris back . Both dredges went overboard again . " My old man dredged for 50 years , " Wadie says . Wade H. Murphy Sr. had skippered the George W. Collier . Young Wadie 's brother , Bart , skippers the Ruby G. Ford . " It 's all we ever done , " Wadie says , " I would n't want to tong ? I like to sail . " He does n't know how much longer shipjacks will work the bay . " Five years ago I said it could n't last another two years , but the last two winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a crewman looks up ; the halfinch steel dredgeline again jerks tight  --  the iron dredge Is snagged below , The great , slow , tractor-like power of dense winter air in those massive sails becomes apparent as the cable rips out its steel bearing roller , tears thru the boat 's sideboards like a knife thru paper , wrenches the steel pulley frame awry , cuts the engine housing and comes to rest against a radiator spouting hot water . In a second it was over , mid Wadie 's calm voice sounded , " Drop the sails . " " Sure was a big hang , " says a crewman , and Wadi ? grins and surveys his damage . He 'd been dredging 90 minutes and had only 32 bushels of his 150-bushel limit . Now he had , by his estimate , $400 to $500 damage to repair and , at the current price of $9,50 a bushel , $531 of gross earnings he would n't make that day . But it was part of the game , a tough game in which weather and bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wadie said , as he motored back , leaving the bar to his competitors , " I was catchin ' more orsters and makin ' more money than I ever ' did , and . the bowsprit brok . Boat was laid up three weeks and cost me $2,500 to fix . " It was blowin ' a gale , and everybody was goin ? in . I only needed 10 more bushels ? could'a got ' em in 15 minutes . When the bowsprit went the mast just laid right back on the deck . Lucky nobody got killed . " IT IS OPERATING a it d maintenance cost that make shipjacking less attractive year after year . Of each day 's take , " the boat " gets one third for operation and repairs with the remaining two thirds being divided evenly between the captain and his five crewmen . If the captain is to earn more than a crewman it has to come out of " the boat 's third . " " Some of the watermen , " said a state official , " keep their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to last a few years . " All over the bay derelict shipjack hulls lle in shallow creeks , and only once a year or so Is one retired to use as a pleasure yacht . SINCE 71IE oyster season only last from Nov. to March 15 , most oystermen either farm In summer or make their living crabbing from a small motorboat that can be converted to oystering in winter . Wade Murphy knows he 'll quit sailing soon , and he just bought a new crab boat . Still , he 'd hate to see Sigsbeo die . He does n't say that 's why , but he just spent $2,000 for copper sheeting to protect her hull from ice and ordered new dacron sails at $2,850 . " Maybe she 'll be worth more when I sell her , " he says .
