" I have never snatched so quickly at a role in my life , " said Sir Laurence Olivier . Something Shakespearean ? Not at all . Next season at London 's Old Vic . the 63-year-old actor ( who was honored with a life peerage last week , making him the only lord on the British stage ) will play Nathan Detroit , proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in the durable Damon Runyon musical Guys and Dolls . Sir Laurence dismisses suggestions that the accents of the Queen 's English can not adapt to the argot of Times Square . As for Detroit 's one song-well , Sir Laurence has carried a tune onstage before ( in The Entertainer ) , though he does n't much relish the chore : " It hurtsi my throat , and I ca n't stand the noise . " <P> Time and age had clearly mellowed the antipathies of World War II . As Charles de Gaulle , 79 , met Spain 's Generalissimo Francisco Franco , 77. somehow the towering caller managed to reduce the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 in. ) by the very depth of his bow . What they talked about was nobody 's business but theirs - particularly De Gaulle , who is keeping a travelogue for his memoirs . After the 45-minute chat . El Caudillo honored the first-time visitor to Spain by taking him home to lunch . <P> When Salome begins peeling off those seven veils in the Strauss opera , no one expects her to hit rock bottom - and given the construction of most sopranos , no one much minds if she does n't . But U.S. Mezzo-Soprano Grace Bumbry , 33 , whose physical endowment ( 371-251-4(H) is as rich as her voice , playfully promised to strip to her " jewelry and perfume " for her opening performance at London 's Royal Opera House . To the delight of first-nighters - who could n't see her brief bikini - Miss Bumbry was almost as good as her word . <P> <P> They do it in France , but U.S. generals caught kissing each other would be likely to lose their stars . Not any more . Last week in Washington , Army Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two WAC colonels , pronounced " a new protocol for congratulating lady generals , " and promptly planted a brassy kiss on the mouths of WAC Brigadier Generals Elizabeth P. Hoisington , 51 , and Anna Mae Hays , 50-the first women in U.S. Army history to attain the rank . <P> " I conjure my friends , " Charles Dickens wrote in his will , " on no account to make me the subject of any monument , memorial or testimonial whatever . " Last week in London , scores of friends ignored that slightly Uriah Heep-ish injunction to honor the 100th anniversary of the author 's death . One presence that Dickens himself would have appreciated : his great-great-grandson Adam Dickens , 9 , in high collar , waistcoat and chain , looking as if he had just stepped from the pages of David Copperfield . <P> Twenty years a housefather to singers and never once in a singer 's home ? How come ? asked TV 's Dick Cavett of the guest on his talk show . No mixing of business and pleasure ? Not that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come to think of it , they did n't invite me . " Unappreciative , really , considering all that Bing has done for them : " When I came , we had a deficit of half a million dollars . I 've worked hard , and now we have a deficit of well over $4,000,000 . " <P> Georgia 's most prominent picketer.
