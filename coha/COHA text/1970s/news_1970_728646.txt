txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times SST Benefits To the Editor : The Times editorializes ( " SST on the Over-Runway " June 1 ) that the SST " . . . promises great damage at great expense to provide a minimal convenience for a minimum of travelers . " In refuting those charges I use as my main reference a source clearly not objective but who at least backs up his statements with facts . He 's John Swihart , Boeing 's chief engineer for the production of SST . From the taxpayer 's standpoint the U.S. Government will invest ( and be repaid ) $1.2 billion in the prototype phase . Boeing will invest $202 million , General Electric $86 million , the major subcontractors $55 million , the airlines have already invested $59 million . By the 300th production model the entire Government investment will have been repaid . By the 500th airplane the Government will have received another $1.1 billion in royalties . Future Fares The United States SST has two-thirds the number of seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it will be twice as productive in terms of seatmiles . Swihart says that " only the SST offers the airlines the means to keep fares of the future anywhere near today 's . " As to a " minimum of travelers " : With this economy of fare structure one can assume greater travel inclination for those engaged in international affairs , commerce and travel for pleasure . Using conservative projections  --  five SST 's a month being introduced into service starting in 1978 , restriction of boom-producing flights to oceans and the Arctic , a passenger load-factor history the same as the subsonic jets  --  the SST will produce 250 billion revenue passenger miles by 1980 . That is more than the total Western world traffic in 1967 . Regarding " minimal convenience , " for most routes the SST will cut flight time in half and flights will be much smoother , since they 're at twelve-mile altitudes ? above the weather . On your comment on " great damage , " the SST 's will make much less noise on takeoff and during landing than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during taxiing is greater . But side noise affects airport personnel and arriving and departing passengers , not community residents . Summing up , the United States SST will fly three times as fast , carry more people at lower fares and impose less noise on the community than the subsonic jets . And , rather than cost the taxpayer money , it will be the first transportation system in history that will pay him a cash royalty . JAMES J. HARFORD Executive Secretary American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics New York , June 2 , 1970 ? Doves ' Criticized To the Editor : It amuses me to hear Senators Charles Goodell and Jacob Javits and other prominent doves on Vietnam expressing militaristic views on the Mideast . They fail to understand that the credibility of our commitments can not be confined to a particular geographic area , but must encompass the whole world when it comes to confrontation with the U.S.S.R. I wish someone would explain to me why the Soviet Union should consider our resolve to be firm in the Mideast if we allow ourselves to be humiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me how it serves the cause of world peace when you and other outspoken doves continually undercut our President in his efforts to bring about an honorable end to the Vietnam tragedy . ROBERT J. RASMUSSEN Wayne , N. J. , June 5 , 1970 ? Tribute to Educator To the Editor : The recent Times obituary for Ethel G. Stringfellow did not suggest why Miss Stringfellow meant so much to so many in the course of her long career as teacher and headmistress at the Chapin School in New York City . She was proud of her record in sending a large proportion of girls to good colleges because she saw this as a way of expanding their capacity as useful citizens . She was ahead of her time in insisting upon recognition for independent schoolteachers , not only with improved salaries but as friends within an expanding community . Everyone who knew her has a favorite recollection of her warmth and wit . Perhaps an appropriate one now dates from a summer o'er twenty years ago at St. Hubert 's , New York , where she loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock formation , she tripped and was cautioned by a friend who recalled that a Bryn Mawr College dean had fallen there the year before and spent several weeks in the hospital . " Oh my , " said Miss Stringfellow , " is n't it the truth that the trouble with educators is we just ca n't seem to learn how to put our feet down !

Motorists and Transit To the Editor : We disagree with your recent editorial stand that use of Triborough surpluses represents a giant step toward a unified concept of mass transit for the metropolitan area . It is bad enough that a portion of the present toll revenue should be siphoned off to subsidize mass transit : it will be crassly inequitable if the ability to commandeer motorists ' funds should increase these tolls . Moreover , a coordinated , viable transportation system depends on the best utilization of all major elements in accordance with their special abilities to move people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other through punitive financial levies . can only result in a deteriorated system . No one questions the indispensable role played by the subways in New York , but they , literally can not begin to substitute for the motor vehicle where lack of population density and land use pattern require the use of a car . Mass transit needs to be adequately financed and improved , but this is a far bigger job than can be accomplished by imposing the burden on a single group of citizens , the motorist . It 's time to cease . trying to rescue mass transit by killing off automotive traffic . This approach can only result in two deprived and inefficient sys ? tems , because the financial difficulties of mass transit can not be solved by piecemeal improvising or other than broadly , based public financing . Doubling Triborough and Port Authority Bridge tolls and tolling the East River and Harlem River bridges to discourage automobile use is not a way out of the city 's transportation difficulties . Such an approach can only defeat the objective of improved transportation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York New York , May 15 , 1970 ? Welfare Plan Scored To the Editor : Taxes are going to skyrocket unless something is done quickly . The Nixon welfare plan will double the welfare rolls and cost more than $10 billion in increased taxes . This will come out of the pockets of American taxpayers . About twenty million more Americans will just quit working and become welfare chiselers . C. C. MOSELEY Glendale , Calif. , May 31 , 1970
