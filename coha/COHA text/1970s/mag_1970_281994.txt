No one , to the day of my graduation , had ever taught me to look understandingly at a painting , or a tree , or the facade of a building . <P> - George F. Kennan , Memoirs <P> Kennan is far from alone . Because of widespread visual illiteracy , most of man-made America is ugly , messy and inchoate . But something may soon be done about the root problem . Next week Senator Claiborne Pell 's Education Subcommittee will hold hearings on a bill that would provide $10 million annually for environmental-including visual-education . During the hearings , the committee members ( average age : 54 ) will be asked to pore over a book written expressly for 13-year-olds . <P> Our Man-Made Environment : Book Seven is , quite simply , the best primer on architecture and urban planning yet published in the U.S. Designed to open the eyes of seventh graders to the world being built around them , the book has much to teach adults as well . <P> Aspiration . It was conceived in 1966 after some educators in the Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Architects to help explain architecture to kids . But the collaborators set even higher goals . " We wanted to make students aware of their environment , " says Architect Alan Levy . " We wanted to give them confidence in their ability to make judgments about what they like and do n't like . Finally , we hoped to give them a sense of aspiration beyond the limits of the environment they know . " <P> The job took 31 years and $60,000 in foundation grants . Last summer the educators and architects formed GEE ! ( the Group for Environmental Education ) to work out , says GEE ! Vice President William Chapman , a complete teaching program and to distribute the book . All 20,000 copies have since been sold ( at cost ) to schools in Philadelphia-plus Houston , San Mateo , Columbus , Ohio , and six cities in New Jersey . Despite its grade school language , the book is used by sophomores studying architecture at the University of North Dakota . <P> See and Do . Our Man-Made Environment bristles with challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be folded to make beams , roofs , and whole buildings . One of the first lessons asks students to punch out six geometric shapes and arrange them in a pleasing design within a rectangular frame . When the students turn over the shapes , they find that the pieces represent armchairs , a table , a TV set . The next step is to rearrange the shapes within a room , which entails thinking about how people best communicate . <P> The lessons soon get more complex . <P> Students learn about weather , topography and motion as determinants of design . They are required to see and draw the " rhythmic " elements of a streetscape , like doors and windows . As if that were not demanding enough , the kids must also arrange identical punch-out " buildings " so that one-then two-units stand out among the rest . This done , they may never look blindly at a street again .
