txt Would you like to fly from Chicago to St. Louis for $15 ? Or New York to Los Angeles for $90 ? Or Boston to Miami for $46 ? Bargain air fares , long advocated by consumer groups , could well be moving closer to reality . Developments this week , including an unexpected plug from President Carter , indicate the political climate in Washington is becOming ripe for a test of sharply lower air fa-res . The result could be travel bargains all over the country of the type enjoyed by I in-state passengers in California and Texas . It could alsomean stiffened price competition among the nation 's 10 major air carriers . Adding impetus to the drive for lower air fares was a report just issued by the General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress . After an 18-month study , the GM ) concluded that airlines are overcharging the public by $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion a year . Fares could be slashed by that amount , GM. ) contended , and still provide sufficient-profits for the air carriers . Ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the airlines , GAO reports . Instead , the extra funds are eaten ' up by excess capacity ( all those empty seats ) , champagne flights , and other inefficiencies and frills . " The GAO study dramatizes the pressing need for quick action by Congress , " says Sen. EdWard M. Kennedy ( 1 ) ) of . Massachusetts , who released the GAO report . " It would be irresponsible to continue to tolerate an outmoded regulatory system that taxes the nation 's business and pleasure travelers with high air fares , " he says . The argument from those who want lower air fares compares federally regulated fares with those which are not federally regulated . Senator Kennedy cites this example : In California , where airlines fly within state boundaries without federal price regulations , it costs $31.75 to fly 456 miles from San Diego to San Francisco . // From page 1 *Bargain flying on U.S. horizon On the East Coast , where prices are fed:er , ally controlled , it costs $51 to fly 399 ' miles from Boston to Washington . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp issue with the GAO report , ' Arthur H. Simms , director of CAB 's Bureau of Economics , calls the charge of overpricing " speculative and inflated . " Analysis of the GAO report indicates most Of the claimed savings are illusory ? or the result of service cutbacks , he says . " For example , " says Mr. Simms , " the. ; ; report assumes the elimination of all first-class service , and ' counts the difference between first-class and coach fares as a savings to the traveling public . Moreover , the rate of return found reasonable for the airlihe industry under free market conditions appears too low to ' attract capital in a competitive marketplace . " Already , Mr. Simms notes , the CAB has taken steps to increase price competition ' and increase efficiencies in the air industry . These recent changes have already brought about an estimated $750 million in savings . Another CAB economist contends that operating a single market , like California , is ? far less costly than operating " a nationwide airline . Meanwhile , focus now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will support legislation already in the hopper to deregulate airlines . That apparently means the Air Transportation Regulatory Reform Act of 1977  - -  cosponsored by Senator Kennedy and Sen. Howard W. Cannon ( D ) of Nevada . The Kennedy-Cannon bill would open up the air industry to price cutting , provide easier entry into the industry for new carriers , and allow existing carriers to alter their route structures with greater ease .
