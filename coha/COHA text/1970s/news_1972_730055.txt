txt Against a backdrop of rising national opposition to busing , Congress has begun agonized deliberations over President Nixon 's two anti-busing bills . Prospects are for a series of lengthy hearings by at least four congressional committees . One began Friday , and a second opens Monday . Members of Congress ? most of whom face re-election campaigns in November ? try to pick their way gingerly through the political minefield that the issue has become ? without detonating any explosions . Despite Nixon administration pressure , the Congress clearly is in no hurry to act . Tack-on possibility The substance of Mr. Nixon 's busing moratorium bill has the best chance of relatively swift congressional approval . Its supporters will try to tack it onto an already overloaded education bill which ? in widely divergent forms  --  has passed both Senate and House , Members of a Senate-House conference are immersed in the complex task of trying to reconcile the two versions .

Prospects appear uncertain at this juncture . The bill already contains widely disparate busing provisions that must be reconciled If the busing moratorium provision is n't appended to this bill , it must run a time-consuming congressional gauntlet . It must be considered by the House Judiciary Committee , chaired by Rep. Emanuel Celler ( D ) of New York , who says the Nixon proposal " appears an unwise , impractical , and unconstitutional road . " In the Senate the bill must be heard bythe Judiciary Committee , tied up for the foreseeable future with the ITT case as it relates to the Nixon nomination of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general . In more trouble yet is the President 's other bill , on which Senate hearings began Friday and House hearings start Monday . White liberals and blacks ? in and out of Congress ? point out the Nixon bill does notactually add any new money at all , The $2.5 billion includes $1.5 billion already earmarked for poverty schools under another government program ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference ? money intended for schools that are desegregating . Influential congressional protesters plan to introduce bills that would , in fact , give an extra $2.5 billion to schools with many poor children .
