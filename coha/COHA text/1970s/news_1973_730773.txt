txt Though Nixon Administration officials have praised the press for its role in exposing the Watergate scandal , new questions are being raised here about the manner and motivation of the press 's continuing investigative campaign . The Watergate mosaic is seen more clearly daily as the pieces are pieced together . Could the public have been kept informed in a less frenzied and hazardous way ? This apprehensive capital pauses a moment to debate this issue which goes to the heart of the processes of a free society . Veteran press critic Vice-President Spiro T , Agnew , says , " I applaud the results , but I can not applaud the techniques beinkused . It'aavery short jump from McCarthyism to what is going on now . " He argues that there is " a ? great amount of speculation , a great amount of hearsay , and a great amount of material from sources without the courage to reveal them . selves . " ' The White House itself is , at this moment , quiet on the issue , having only recently praised the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seep through . White House officials will only acknowledge that Mr. Nixon has read of Mr. Agnew 's criticism , as well as that of Sen. William Proxmire . They would not pass , along Mr. Nixon 's reaction . What brings Mr. Agnew back to the trenches ? though he emphasizes he does n't want to pick a new quarrel ? is that it is the President who lately has been made the object of much suspicion . The President denies ? sometimes more categorically than others ? the various allegations . He does so through his press aides . Senator Proxmire says " the crux of the matter is whether or not the President had knowledge of the Watergate case , and this should not rest on the apparently unsupported allegations of unidentified investigators . " 4 A Wisconsin friend of Mr. Proxmire immediately reported to news media that Mr. Proianire had told him the President was " involved in Watergate up to his ears . " Mr. Proxmire admits saying this but insists there was a difference between saying it in a private telephone call and calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Senator Proxmire readily told the press there was " lots of evidence " the President was involved . The response of most newsmen to Mr. Agnew is that much of what has been spread on the record thus far is // *Questions about media // from testimony sworn to , though secretly , before lawenforcement officials . Faced with very elaborate government devices for suppression of news , news media say they are forced to be aggressive and perennially suspicious . Denials solicited In the process , it is insisted , those hurt by the disclosures are asked for their tortes ? and even President Nixon , through his spokesmen , prefers to not specifically refute some of the charges . Again and again , White House Press Secretary ROnald Ziegler says he is instructed not to comment lest ' the cases against various individuals be prejudiced . Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania-upholds ' - Mr ? Agnew. - " We are seeing the shaking and scaring of , the people of this country needlessly . They read in the paper something , terrible about the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , look , the President did n't do this . There 's no proof . " There is , many newsmen concede , an admitted heavy burden to avoid injuring either individuals or the democratic process of justice . Where the press does not readily admit its errors and engage in criticism of its own product , it is apparent , the free press system is scarred ? even though the writers of the Con : stitution found no way to protect a free press except to let it print both fact and fiction . A major test What ultimately comes out of the free-for-all , however , may be a better understanding of what ' a people 's government is doing or not doing . That is one test in the Watergate case , it seems clear to all the debaters , and the answer appears to be more favorable to the news media than in earlier months . Requests by ' White House correspondents for press tonferenced to enable the President to clarify his situation continue to be shunted eide much as they have , always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate and its cover-up would not have occurred it press conferences were held regularly . Three press conferences have been held this year , the last one being on March r5 . Earlier this year the President 's staff indicated press conferences would be held every three weeks in his second term . White HousePretia secretari-Ziegler now says that there will be ho press conference this week , though a week ago he said ? after discussing the matter with the President , ? one would beheld ! ! . relativelyaoon. ! ' This is not ' the first time the question of " McCarthyism " has been raised , as the media have reported the sensational Watergate developments . Hearsay ' charges dropped Until a month ago , White House spokesmen labeled everything the Washington Post uncovered as " hearsay . " H. R. , Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman were said to be smeared . Suddenly the White House stopped saying this as the testimony before the grand jury and anonymous interviews appeared to be confirming the worst initial suspicions and much more . Who , could have supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department ' could have become so tarnished ? Thus far there have been no loud bellows from the government prosecutors working with the Watergate grand jury . They did object strenuously to the transcripts of the grand jury being printed in Jack Anderson 's syndicated column .
