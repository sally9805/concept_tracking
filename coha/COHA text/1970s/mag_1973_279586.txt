LEO ROSTEN 'S TREASURY OF JEWISH QUOTATIONS 716 pages . McGraw-Hill. $10.95 . <P> <P> The subtitle of this vast collection might be : " You do n't have to be Jewish to like Leo Rosten . " Where else , after all , could the one-liner addict of whatever persuasion be exposed to a barrage of ecstasy that includes the following punches : " May all your teeth drop out , except one-so you should have a permanent toothache . " " If you lend someone money , and he avoids you you 've gotten off cheap . " " A man is not honest just because he has had no chance to steal . " " Sleep faster , we need the pillows . " <P> The author , who began collecting Yiddish aphorisms in his childhood and continued throughout a distinguished academic career , provides a fine sketch of Jewish social character in the introduction . He is nothing if not thorough . <P> As the book says , " Where there is too much something is missing . In this case it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use cutting out repetition . <P> Not to worry . The book is still lull of gems . For those who need definitions of Yiddishisms that have crept into everyday use , Rosten provides examples , many with a fond patina of age : chutzpa is a case of " a man who , having killed his mother and father , asks the court for mercy because he is an orphan , poor schlemiel is a man who " falls on his back and breaks his nose . " Some lines are cosmic as well as comic : " The rich have heirs , not children . " " Good men need no recommendation and bad men it would n't help . " <P> The Jews have devised a saying to prove just about anything , natural enough for a people whose recorded history stretches back more than 2,500 years . But they have also framed the best single-sentence putdown for anyone who cites one of them as an example to make his point : " ' For instance ' is not proof .
