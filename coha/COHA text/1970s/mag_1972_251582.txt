In one of the oddest administrative tricks in its history , the United Nations Secretariat disclosed last week that it was excising all references to Taiwan and the Nationalist Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek from U.N . documents , including statistical works . <P> The man behind the decision was Secretary General Kurt Waldheim , who apparently caved in to Chinese pressure on the eve of his visit to Peking last week . The Chinese argued that last year 's General Assembly resolution expelling Taiwan had automatically applied to all branches of the U.N. , including the Statistical Office . The argument was nonsense , since U.N . reference works have always included data about non-members-including China before it was admitted-and disputed territories . Nonetheless , the Chinese were adamant and won their battle . <P> On top of that , a bronze plaque bearing the words " Gift of the Republic of China " was removed from a green marble slab outside the delegates ' lounge . The marble slab , which the Nationalist Chinese had given to the U.N . in 1968 , bore a quotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence and neighborliness prevail . "
