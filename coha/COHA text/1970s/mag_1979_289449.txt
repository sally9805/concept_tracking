A visiting Prime Minister encounters tension and tough talk over trade <P> <P> Shortly after he took office in December , Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira , following a ritual established by his predecessors , scheduled a trip to Washington to clear up what he thought would be some minor issues . As it happened , Ohira 's visit to the U.S. last week took place in an atmosphere of tension and ill will caused by the growing confrontation between the U.S. and Japan over trade . <P> Despite repeated promises by the Japanese to dismantle their myriad nontariff barriers and allow more foreign goods into their potentially rich market , Japan 's trade surplus continues to pile up . Last year it rose to $24.6 billion , from $17.3 billion in 1977 . Imports of Toyotas , Sony TVs , Nikon cameras and other Japanese goods to the U.S. outpaced American exports to Japan by $13 billion , accounting for fully a third of the American trade deficit . <P> No substantive trade issues were resolved during the visit , but Ohira showed a conciliatory attitude that managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's intentions and the talk of economic retaliation . In his three-hour meeting with President Carter , Ohira pledged to push to narrow the trade gap between the two nations , noting that some improvement has already been made . Japan 's trade surplus in the first three months of this year totaled $2.7 billion , vs. $6.7 billion in the same period last year . Generally Carter and Ohira hit it off fairly well . Honoring Ohira 's request for a " truly American meal , " the President served up a barbecued buffalo dinner on the White House grounds , with the Texas barbecue sauce stirred up by the President 's chief trade negotiator , Robert Strauss . <P> Still , some Administration officials fear that Congress , in its present impatient mood , could take severe action against Japanese imports . Anger at Japan 's nontariff restrictions has been intensifying in both the U.S. and Europe . Congressional leaders have warned that unless Japan moves more quickly to cut its surplus , Congress will impose a 15% tariff surcharge on Japanese goods , and take other retaliatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see no good reason for the U.S. to commit economic harakiri on the altar of a bogus free-trade relationship . " <P> The immediate focus of U.S. ire is Japan 's reluctance to open up enough of its government contracts to foreign bidders . Specifically , the U.S. wants to be allowed to bid on high-technology items like computers and switching equipment bought by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co . ( NTT ) . But NTT vigorously opposes foreign bidding because the company has worked closely with several Japanese suppliers in developing its computer technology , which it protects like a mother bear guarding her cubs . Yet such technology is precisely where the U.S. has an edge , and could expand in what will be a growing industry in years to come . For many American businessmen and politicians , the NTT case is a perfect example of how Japan 's cartel-like industry , in alliance with major trading houses , is able to preserve its profit margins by holding sway over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party , which is largely financed and backed by big business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
