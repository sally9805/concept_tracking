Eternal glory to Comrade Chou Enlai , great proletarian revolutionary of the Chinese people and outstanding Communist fighter ! <P> <P> So , in part , read the official announcement issued last week by Hsin-hua , the Chinese press agency . Soon after , it appeared again on the black-bordered front page of Peking 's People 's Daily ; it was broadcast , preceded by solemn music , every half-hour on radio stations throughout China . In Peking , the elevator girl in an office building used by foreign journalists burst into tears when she heard the news . Headlines appeared in newspapers throughout the world , and messages of condolence started pouring into the Chinese capital . In a rare gesture of sympathy and respect , the flags at the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong and at the staid , very British Hong Kong Club flew at half mast , as did all the red banners in China . Chou Enlai , for a quarter century Premier of the State Council of the People 's Republic of China and the able administrator of Chairman Mao Tse-tung 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77 . A memorial service , with no foreign dignitaries present , was announced for Jan. 15 . <P> According to the official obituary issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party , he had been suffering from cancer for almost four years . It had been widely thought that Chou had had heart attacks ; the obituary was the first official word that cancer prompted his virtual retirement from public life in June 1974 to a secluded hospital in Peking . Chou apparently played a role in some major policy decisions up until the last few months of his life , but most of his responsibilities had already been entrusted to First Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping , who will almost certainly be appointed Premier . True to his reputation as an administrator par excellence , Chou apparently managed even his own passing from the political scene with dexterity . Sinologists expect no power struggle over Teng 's assumption of higher office-at least not soon . <P> Yet Chou 's death raises important questions about China 's future . How long will the succession he so patiently stage-managed endure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate policies ? Most important of all to those outside of China , will Chou 's belief in cautious dtente with the U.S. , Japan and Western Europe , and his unremitting hostility toward the Soviet Union continue to guide foreign policy ? <P> As long as Chou remained alive , even gravely ill on a hospital bed , the policies pursued by Teng Hsiao-ping bore the stamp of the Premier 's authority . For many world statesmen-notably including Henry Kissinger-Chou personified what they would like China to be : reasonable , flexible , nonaggressive ( see obituary , page 30 ) . With the Premier 's death , China lost half of the remarkable team that symbolized the People 's Republic both to its own people and to those outside . Now only Mao remains , mentally alert at 82 but frail , slack-jawed and slurred of speech .
