It was an idea whose time had been a long season coming . Since 1923 , a constitutional amendment proposing equal rights for women had languished in Congress , debated seriously only rarely . But last week , with a disparate array of midwives in attendance , the Equal Rights Amendment passed the Senate , 84 to 8 , and was sent to the states for ratification . If approved by three-quarters of the states , it will become the 27th Amendment to the Constitution . <P> The final push was provided by growing feminist pressure in an election year ; more than half of the country 's registered voters are women . Although many women could not care less about the amendment , those who do came out in force . Representatives from such varied groups as the National Federation of Business and Professional Women 's Clubs and the American Home Economics Association worked alongside militant Women 's Liberationists . On the day of the vote , the Senate galleries were filled . Liz Carpenter , Lady Bird Johnson 's former press secretary , played a latter-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked on a needlepoint design carrying the motto UPPITY WOMEN UNITE . Exercising her privilege of access to the Senate floor , Michigan Representative <P> Martha Griffiths , who shepherded the amendment to House approval last year , borrowed Edmund Muskie 's desk and kept a tally on the voting . <P> The final battle centered on a series of crippling provisos put forth by Democrat Sam Ervin of North Carolina . Ervin feared that women would suffer hardships and dangers if the amendment passed . He tried to limit its scope to allow existing protective legislation to stand after passage . Ervin raised the specter of women " sent into combat , where they will be slaughtered or maimed by the bayonets , the bombs , the bullets , the hand grenades , the mines , the napalm , the poison gas and the shells of the enemy . " Illinois ' Adlai Stevenson III replied : " What we are doing is enunciating a principle in the Constitution of the U.S. There are and will be classifications based on sex which will be held not to deny or abridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ervin proposals was defeated . <P> The ratification process will have to be completed within seven years for the amendment to become law ; the Hawaii legislature started the process by voting approval just 32 minutes after the Senate had acted . Nebraska , New Hampshire , Delaware , Iowa and Idaho followed suit within days . <P> Some laws will likely be struck down , others rewritten to apply to both sexes equally . Married women could retain their names or take the names of their husbands . Alimony could be available to either spouse ; child-custody laws that specify a preference for the mother could become invalid . Many of the protective labor laws might become invalid ; banning women from certain jobs because of the possibility of pregnancy could also be forbidden . Laws against prostitution could be jeopardized unless the customer is also subject to penalty .
