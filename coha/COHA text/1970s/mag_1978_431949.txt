 | The Startling Story of Son of Sam 's " Real Mother David Berkowitz murdered six people and maimed seven . Not until he was caught did Betty Falco learn he was the son she 'd given up 24 years earlier . Betty Falco 's life had never been easy . But little did she suspect , as she lisned attentively to the 7 A.M. ews report on her radio , that much worse was still to come . It was August 11 , 1977 ? more than a year since the killer known as " Son of Sam " had begun his mad rampage through the streets of New York City with his .44-caliber revolver . Up to now , his score was six dead , seven maimed ? and , as far as Betty knew , he was still on the loose . Like millions of other New Yorkers , Betty dreaded and hated this madman . She grieved for the people whose sons and daughters had been his victims ; she feared for the lives of her own beloved children and grandchildren . For weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , on this fateful morning , she heard on the radio that her prayers had finally been granted . Son of Sam had been captured ! His reign of terror was over . But her intensely felt relief was to last only a moment . Seconds later , when Betty Falco learned Son of Sam 's true identity , her heart nearly stopped . David Berkowitz , the accused and selfconfessed mass murderer , was her own flesh and blood , her naturalborn son Richard . It was unbearable . It was not even possible . But it was true . In the whole astonishing course of her relationship with her son ? from their traumatic separation 24 years earlier to their emotional reunion many years later ? nothing had prepared her for such a tragic turn of events . Not even her worst nightmares could measure up to the horrible reality that she suddenly had to deal with . This is her story . * * * The daughter of impoverished , non-English-speaking , Jewish immigrants , Betty grew up with nine brothers and sisters in a poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , she had to leave school and earn her own keep . Her meager education prepared her for only the lowest-paying factory jobs . When she met and married Tony Falco , the fact that he was Italian and she Jewish seemed no obstacle . Both worked for several years and ultimately invested their hardearned savings in a fish store . When Betty became pregnant she looked optimistically to the future . But her marriage to Tony was a mistake . In less than a year after she gave birth , Tony ran off with another woman ? leaving Betty with an infant daughter to support as best she could . She never saw him again . Soon afterward , Betty met a man named Joe ? Jewish , married , with three children and a wife who refused to give him a divorce . For the next 29 years , until his death , Joe would spend his free hours with Betty and then return home to his family every night . It was by no means an ideal relationship , but it helped to fill the void . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often crude mannerisms , who appreciated Betty 's passionate warmth and generosity and her values of decency and honesty . In his own way , he loved 79  | her , but he was a man of limited sensibility and he arranged his life to suit his own best interests . So years later , when Betty became was to become of him . She ran all the way home , her vision blurred by her tears . The baby had taken a turn for Four days after her son was born , Betty dressed him , held him for the last time , then handed the infant to a total stranger . Later , she told her family that the baby had died . pregnant , Joe told her he would not give her a penny toward the baby 's support . He would not tolerate the disgrace of an illegitimate child . Confused and full of fear , working full-time and bringing up her 13-yearold daughter Roslyn single-handedly , Betty could not imagine how she would be able to raise another child . One of her neighbors came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . She told Betty about a fine Jewish couple she knew who could not have a child of their own . They would give Betty 's as-yet-unborn baby all the care and love he deserved . Feeling she had no other choice , Betty consented to the arrangement . As she now explains that fateful decision , " I did it for Joe 's children 's sake and for mine , and because of the disgrace . It was n't right , what I had done , and now I had to pay for it . " Giving up her beautiful baby boy for adoption when he was four days old was the hardest thing she ever had to do . On June 3 , 1953 , two days after giving birth , she left the hospital and reported to her daughter , her sisters , her brothers , and everyone else close to her , that little Richard David was ill and could not yet come home . On the fourth day of Richard 's life , Betty returned to the hospital , dressed her baby and held him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She carried him out of the hospital and , there , on the front steps , handed the infant over to a total stranger , the liaison between the families . It was all very legal and proper . But the love she already felt for her newborn was almost overpowering and it took all her strength to turn away from baby Richard , never to know what the worse , she told her family . He would never come home . He had died . Her daughter Roslyn has not forgotten how it felt to be told that the sweet baby brother , whom she herself had seen in the hospital , was gone forever . She had looked forward to welcoming him , helping care for him . " I cried , and I accepted it , Roslyn states matter-of-factly . Did Betty have any regrets ? " Oh , yes ! " says Betty , remembering her anguish . " One day when I was alone with Joe , I just let go . I hit him and pounded on him . I was yelling , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . I want my baby ! ' " But , of course , it was too late . Seventeen months after she gave him up , formal adoption papers were processed and Richard David Falco became David Richard Berkowitz , the son of Nat and Pearl Berkowitz . With time , the shock wore off . For the next 22 years , Betty and Roslyn continued their struggle to survive . Although Betty worked hard , her income was barely adequate and Roslyn was forced to leave high school before graduating , to work in a series of factory jobs . She grew into a remarkably pretty and intelligent young woman , imbued with her motner 's intense thoughtfulness and sincerity , wise beyond her years . After her marriage to Leo , a bus driver , a decent , generous man , Roslyn devoted herself to the work of a housewife and mother , trying to create for her two daughters an environment of love and warmth . When the girls grew older , she returned to work and volunteered as an attendant for the neighborhood ambulance corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roslyn had an instinctive so @# suspicion that there was more to the story about her brother than she had been told . Years later , when Joe was dying , Roslyn , after persistent questioning , finally learned the truth from her mother ? that she did indeed still have a brother . At once Roslyn was overcome with an impulse to find him : " But my mother begged me not to track him down . She said , Do n't destroy his life . You do n't know what he knows . He 's with a good family . Do n't do it ! ' I said , Okay Ma , for you I wo n't do it . ' A then . suddenly , he came to us. " * * * It was May 12 , 1975 , the day after Mother 's Day . In her Brooklyn apartment house , Betty went downstairs to get her mail . Something extraordinary was waiting for her ? an envelope folded over many times until it was small enough to push through the narrow slit in the mailbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ) " were written on the outside . Inside , was a typical Mother 's Day card ? with a very untypical original poem written on the blank side in neat , clear print . The poem said , in part : " So , as once before We 've been destined To meet once more . And I guess the time is now I should say hello ? but how ? Happy Mother 's Day ! ( You were my mother in a very special way . ) Love , R.F. ' There was a phone number under the initials . The R.F. never rang a bell for Betty , but she called the number . As Betty remembers the first words her son ever spoke to her , her voice fills with tenderness . " He sounded like a little boy ! I 'm your son , Richard Falco , ' he said . You gave birth to me on June 1 , 1953 . ' " Minutes later Roslyn received a call from her mother . " She was completely hysterical , " Roslyn recalls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son , it 's my son ! ' " The anticipated reunion was surprisingly smooth . It was a thrill for Betty just to see him ? strong and healthy , his stocky build and dark wiry curls reminiscent of Joe , his large blue eyes framed with  | striking , well-shaped brows , the image of her own . " He looked great to me , " Betty says . He asked them to call him Richard the name Betty had given him . Within weeks , they were calling him Richie . He explained that from the day he learned he was adopted , finding his real parents had been his goal . Many times he had asked his father to give him the adoption papers . His father always refused . when Nat Berkowitz was about to move to Florida , he finally gave the papers to his son . David called every Falco in the one book , asking for Betty and/or Tony . He did research in libraries , pored through old phone books , compared them with new ones . Imploring the phone company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her Brooklyn apartment . Choosing not to ring her bell for fear he would shock her , he placed his poem in her mailbox on Mother 's Day . " He told me that he loved me , " says Betty of the day they finally met , " and he forgave me . He said he knew I must have had a good reason for what I had done . " He said his adoptive parents had been good to him . He told them his adoptive mother had died several years earlier , but he was in into his arms and he would kiss her . " Wendy , 11 , enjoyed his visits , too . " He helped me with my homework . He listened to records with me and we talked and played games , " she remembers . One day the girls received two necklaces from him in the mail . When Wendy 's broke , she refused to throw it out . Mending it as best she could , she wore it for a long time ? because Uncle Richie had sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for minor surgery . " He came to visit me , " she recalls . " I was sleeping and I remember I felt somebody kiss me . I opened my eyes ? and there he was ! " In the summer of 1976 the family was shocked to read in the papers that on the night of July 29 , a sadistic maniac had murdered Donna Lauria , 18 , and wounded Jody Valente , 19 , in the first of what was to be an incredible series of shootings with a .44-caliber pistol . Betty and Roslyn caught their breath when they realized that , three months earlier , Richard had lived in the neighborhood of the shootings . With a madman on the loose , they were grateful that he was now living safely in Yonkers . " I want you to know one thing , " her brother told Roslyn . " I would never do anything to hurt you or your little girls . " constant touch with his adoptive father . The next months were a time for joyful celebration . Betty and Roslyn were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked handsome , had a nice car and a good job and was taking courses at a community college . Richard was particularly drawn to Roslyn . He made frequent trips between his apartment in the Bronx , his mother 's in Brooklyn and his sister 's in Queens . Roslyn invited him for dinner often : He brought cake , cheese , soda , mugs , baskets . " He was crazy about Roslyn 's girls , " Betty says . " When they heard him ring the bell , they raced to greet him . Lynn , nine , would fly In the months following their reunion , Betty continued to see Richard as content and successful . But Roslyn began to sense that there was more to him than showed on the surface : " I had an inkling of something not 100 percent . But I felt he was just very lonely , mixed up . I would never put my finger on crazy . ' " Shortly after they became acquainted , Nat Berkowitz called Roslyn . He felt strongly that David needed psychiatric help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror , pounding his head with his hands . He begged Roslyn to see if she could get her brother to go for help . Roslyn tried , but was unable to convince David to get therapy . She offered to go with him , if that would make it easier . But his response was always the same : " I tried it , and they ca n't help me . I do n't like talking to them . " Soon after that , Nat Berkowitz called her again with an even more urgent problem . He was upset because David had just called and told him that he was going to a doctor and was going to die . There was something wrong with his head . Roslyn was stunned . She had heard nothing about this from Richard . She called Richard immediately and asked , " What is this about your head ? " Richard answered , " Yeah , I probably have a tumor or something . I do n't have too long to live . I 'm going to go to the doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , no , ' he assured her and there was no further discussion . When she called him the next day , she asked him if he had gone to the doctor . He said , " No , " as if the whole thing never existed . On another occasion , when Roslyn was speaking to him on the phone , he said , " Do you hear that ? Do you hear those dogs ? " Roslyn acknowledged that she heard them . He told her that the super had two big dogs in the backyard that were barking all the time . " They 're driving me crazy , " he said . " Sometimes I think they 're doing it just for spite , just to get me . When I come home and they know I have to sleep , they start barking . " , Then there was the phone conversation Roslyn had with Richard when he really seemed " out of it . " " He was sort of giggling . I asked him what was the matter . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , but they 're not going to get me . ' I said , Who is out to get you ? ' He said , People , just people . I think my phone is bugged . I even think they bugged my car . They 're out to get me , they 're gon na get me . ' Again I asked , Who ? What makes you say this ? ' Just people , just people . ' And then he said , I have to go now . ' " Roslyn assumed that he was merely " high " on something .. It seemed the only logical deduction . continued on page 82  | Only rarely did the depth of his unhappiness momentarily reveal itself . One evening , after a family dinner , Roslyn joined Richie in his car when he drove a relative to her apartment . On the way back , Roslyn and Richard did a lot of talking about themselves and their childhoods . When they reached Roslyn 's block , they parked and continued to talk . He was out of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt very down and lonely . Then , suddenly , the feelings he had held in so long overwhelmed him . He covered his face with his hands and started to cry . He cried for a long while . Sadness was evident again in another conversation . While briefly mentioning to his sister his Army experience and the religious interest he had developed at that time under the influence of his Baptist friends , Richard also talked about the possibility of reincarnation and another life . " He said he wished his time would come , so he would go into a second life , " Roslyn recalls . Perhaps their most significant conversation in terms of what the future would bring took place one day when Roslyn and Richard were having lunch together . Roslyn asked , " Richie , is there anything bothering you ? You 're so quiet . " Richard replied , " No , no , just my own problems . They 'll all work out . " Roslyn persisted . " Is n't there anything you want to tell me ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I want you to know one thing . I would never do anything to hurt you or your little girls . " Says Roslyn now , " This , of course , went over my head . " It never occurred to her that he might harm anyone , because no matter what bothered him , there had never been any sign of violence about Richard . For Roslyn , his outstanding trait was his gentleness . He had different moods ? but then , who does n't ? There were times when the TV would n't bother him , and other times when it seemed too loud . " He would 82 never say anything , " says Roslyn , " but you could see by his expression that he was annoyed . He would get up and make it lower . " Sometimes the girls would irritate him . Wendy , for instance , would get on his nerves and he would quietly say , " Wendy ? please . " " There were times , " Roslyn recalls , " when the girls could sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were times when he 'd get annoyed with their jumping all overhim . " With the gentlest gesture , he would indicate he 'd had enough . " Then he would go into the girls ' room , lie down , and sleep for about an hour . " kowitz , the Son of Sam suspect would be explaining to interrogators how heused these to note access routes to the scenes of his crimes . He was occasionally unhappy , he had his moods ? but he was functioning and relating . Whatever eccentric habits the family saw in him seemed well within the range of acceptable behavior . Late in the evening , the family could n't help noticing that a restlessness came over him . Very often , he would go out for walks that lasted up to two hours . He said he " liked to walk . " He often took walks with Leo and with Wendy and Lynn . How were they to imagine that when he walked alone , he was " stalking neighborhoods , " as he later admitted to interrogators ? They knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal . They did not know that he drove all the way to Texas in three days , in June 1976 , and returned with a .44-caliber pistol . They knew that barking dogs annoyed him . They never dreamed he would one day interpret the barking as a message from the devil , ordering him to kill . They knew he liked maps and kept a large quantity of them in his car . When Roslyn 's bank was giving out folders with maps , her first thought was : " I 've got to give this to Richie ; he 's got a lot of maps . " She could never have foreseen the day when David Ber @# On the night of Berkowitz 's arrest , the police described the back of his car as a garbage heap . Photograraphs his apartment showed a sloppy . filthy bachelor pad with piles of pornographic literature , sheets over Son of Sam explained , " It gets dark and I ca n't sleep .

With this " other " side of life so obviously psychotic could n't the family have seen for themselves the true depth of illness ? No . As Betty and her family knew him , he was immaculate His clothes were few and simple but always spotless , his fingernails so clean you could n't help noticing them . He carried a toothbrush with him so he could brush after every meal . His car was a special source pride to him . Often , when he visited Roslyn , he 'd spend hours working on his car or polishing it . Afterwards , greasy and sweaty . he 'd shower and put on a clean shirt . Roslyn rode in the car with him on innumerable occasions ; it was always immaculate inside . shining outside . She never saw it any other way . Did n't the family have an opportunity to get a glimpse of any of his apartments ? Had n't they ever been " inside the killer 's lair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still lived in the Bronx . they occasionally mentioned their curiosity to see his place . He would put them off , saying , " Oh . you do n't want to go there . It 's not a nice neighborhood . " In April 1976 , when he was moving to Yonkers , they offered to help him . Politely , but firmly . continued on page 202  | he turned them down . " I know Leo 's tired . I 'll just get some friends to help me . " In the two years they knew him , they never once saw the way he lived . There was only one time Roslyn actually felt uneasy in relation to her brother . While describing this incident and seeing it for the first time in its true light , the full horror suddenly hit her . It was Thanksgiving night , November 25 , 1976 . Richard , as usual , was part of the family gathering . After watching the 11 o'clock news , he said good night and left . " About ten minutes later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't make it home in this traffic . It 's bumper to bumper , I ca n't get home in this . ' I remember Leo saying to me , I ca n't imagine what kind of traffic there is at this hour . ' Well , I told Richie to stay here and go home in the morning . Wendy was with my mother , so he slept in the room with Lynn ? " At this point in her narrative , Roslyn stopped momentarily . Her entire body seemed to shiver . " When I think of it , my God .... " I was very restless that night , " she continues . " I do n't know why , but I felt strange and I did n't sleep all night . Then I heard Richie get up and go into the living room and lie down on the couch . Then he was in the kitchen . I remember he was eating ? he had all the food out of the refrigerator , the stuffing , the cranberry sauce . Then left very early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Be witz was to explain later , " It gets c and I ca n't sleep . When I 'm home , I to go out . I know what has to be d I am told all day . It becomes a m : : of routine : go out , you know , clean .44 , go out hunting . The spirits watching , riding . . . I would n't do you know , I did n't want to kill so body . I tried to fight it . " Were the " demons " making him r : less that night ? Was his story at " bumper to bumper " traffic a despeattempt to resist their bloodthirsty mands by seeking refuge in his sister 's apartment ? If so , the respite was only temporary For the very next night , on November 1976 , the Son of Sam and severely wounded anne Lomino and Don DeMasi in the Glen 0 : section of Queens ? on street seven blocks fr . Roslyn 's apartment . By the end of November , 1976 the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 ? the one in Flushing in 0 tober and with the two Glen Oaks in November Soon to follow were tmurders of Christine Freuin Forest Hills on Janua 30 , 1977 , and Virginia Vc kerichian , also in Fore Hills , in March 1977 . A the 1977 shootings occurred within easy reach of Rc lyn 's apartment ? a sho walk or drive away . Because of their proximi to the crimes , Roslyn an Betty were terrified . Ever time Betty spoke to he daughter , her final worc were a mother 's warning " Watch the kids . Stay home . " The thought c " Sam " was never far fro Roslyn 's mind . Fearing fc her children and herself , sh waited anxiously for h. arrest . Whenever there was a report on Sam 's latest attacks , she prayed , " I hope they catch him . I hope the catch this maniac .

Roslyn says , " That was the last time he came here ? to pick up the ten dollars . He mailed the ten dollars back to me , two or three weeks later . " I called him after the money came in the mail to tell him I 'd received it . I called him many times , inviting him to join us for dinner . He told me he was very busy and tired after work . He 'd let me know which days he had off ? but he never called again . The next time I saw him , he was in jail . " Early in March 1977 , Roslyn and her family began planning for their traditional Passover Seder dinner . They wanted Richard to join them , as he had the previous year . Wendy and Lynn were particularly eager for his company . They all took turns calling him day after day , at all hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment , they celebrated Passover without him . For David Berkowitz had finally lost all contact with the people he cared most about and was by this time , as Son of Sam , hopelessly enmeshed in the web of horror that his psychosis had created . On April 17 , the .44-caliber killer murdered Valentina Suriani and Alexander Esau . On June 26 , he shot and wounded Judy Placido Sal Lupo . And on Jul ) Stacy Moskowitz was dered and Robert Vio severely maimed . During the first week August , the most ma manhunt in New York tory was on for the .44-c ber killer . Roslyn and B like millions of other fri ened New Yorkers , their ears glued to the reports , hoping for the good news ? Son of Sacapture . On August 11 , very e in the morning , Betty listening to the radio as prepared breakfast . T- : - she heard what she - waiting for ? they had caught the Son of Sam . He reaction was ecstatic . " I was thrilled ! I was jumping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Then I heard the name ? Berkowitz . David . Pine Street . " Betty 's voice is suddenly quiet and her large blue eyes reflect the terror and disbelief of that momen " What was I hearing ? These must be some crazy mis-take ! " On first impulse she called a close relative . He , too had heard and been startled by the radio report . Betty kept protesting , " I do n't believe it ? it ca n't be ? no : Richie , not my son . A coldblooded murderer ? You would have to be an animal ! " Almost simultaneously . Roslyn received a phone call from another relative who informed her , " David was just picked up as the Son of Sam . " Still groggy from sleep , Roslyn , like her mother , could only deny it . She insisted there must have been a mistake . Then she turned on the TV to the 7 km. news . At first there was only the bulletin ? they had caught Son of Sam . Then the name : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it all hit me . My first thought was my mother . My God , I have to get to my mother before she sees this . " She rushed over to her mother 's house , but when Betty opened the door , Roslyn knew right away that she was too late . Betty was in shock . In the next weeks , Betty listened , read and watched , in disbelief , as headlines , stories , pictures and letters were published in profusion , all ostensibly describing her own son ? but not resembling anyone she knew . Heartlessly abandoned as an infant ! Adopted and never got over it ! A recluse , living in his own sick world with no normal relationships . A slob , living in continued on page 207 .  | squalor in his Yonkers apartment . Front-page photos showed his cherubic face with its g ! oating smirk .

I am on a different wavelength than everybody else ? programmed to kill . " Betty heard the noted psychiatrist , Dr. David Abrahamsen , describe her son as " shrewd , " " cunning " and " sadistic . " Another psychiatrist , Dr. Gabriel Koz , said of Berkowitz : " He had to be unable : o relate to other people . Someone able to love would not kill in this way . " And psychologist Salvadore Didato , who had worked with the police in the case , stated , " One of the outstanding things here is the isolation of this man . Perhaps if he 'd had someone to talk to his anger : ould have drained off and he would not have killed . We ca n't live without love . " Betty and her family were especially shocked to hear David Berkowitz say of himself , in conversations with his hospital psychiatrists , " I 've been reduced . I lost human qualities . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no compassion for the human race , no real concern . " These images of a killer all made sense ? but they did not sound like their beloved Richie . Yet in his letters to the family after his arrest , he denied nothing . His first letter , addressed to " Dear Leo , Roz , Wendy , Lynn and Mom , " said in part : " I 'm sorry for the things that have happened to you as a result of me. .. . lust remember the good times we 've had . ; hen we were together . Roz , Mom , I miss your wonderful cooking . Leo , I miss talking with you .... " 1 wish there was some way I could make you happy . " Please take care now .

But she felt repelled by the wave of hostile threats that inundated the hospital where he was being held . The public saw the tragedy only @# from the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames of revenge . As Berkowitz himself so accurately expressed it , " People do n't want to deal with the complexities of it . . . . They just want revenge , justice . That 's all there is to it . It 's a simple matter . " But it was not simple for Betty Falco and her family , who knew that there was a human side to the Son of Sam . It was the only side they had ever known . Now , suddenly , this family , for whom life had been so orderly , was engulfed in a bewildering swirl of events . Roslyn , drawing on an inner source of strength and wisdom that she never knew she had , helped her mother through the initial shock and guilt feelings . Roslyn broke the news to her two young daughters ? and that was particularly hard . How do you tell them that the loving relationship they had enjoyed with their Uncle Richie would exist no more ? And how do you explain , to girls of 13 and 11 , the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him : " Will he be in jail ? Will they hit him ? Will they beat him ? " Roslyn assured them that he was in a hospital and doctors were trying to make him better . The girls were upset for a long time . Their nights were filled with terrible dreams . Hordes of reporters mobbed Roslyn 's doorstep in the next few weeks , rang her bell and called her continuously on the phone . She dodged and fended them off , often obliged to drive around the block for an hour until the coast was finally clear . She learned to ignore the hate mail that was coming in . Finally , she had to hire a lawyer to protect her family ? and then another lawyer , to protect her from the first one , who turned out to be untrustworthy. continued on page 208 100 Tea BAGS  | But most difficult of all was facing to the reality of what Richard h done ? and trying to live with it .

A different ambulance responded to the call , but when Roslyn heard that the patient was one of Son of Sam 's victims . she turned white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sick . S thought to herself : " God , do n't ever me see this girl . God forbid I shoul ever get that call . I would n't want to see her and have to think that he did this. - Numb with dread , Roslyn went to King 's County Hospital to see her half ? brother . Of this first visit Roslyn says " It was terrible , it really was . I jus : looked at Richie , but , of course , I kept , thinking to myself : My God , I 'm sitting here , face to face , with Son of Sam ' . They spent most of the visit discussing his legal problems . He did not want to be declared incompetent , nor did he wish to plead innocent by reason of insanity He wanted to plead guilty and go to trial . A trial was crucial to him . He was adamant about wanting to get the " true story " out , so people would know that @# FIB  | David Berkowitz was ? as he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving person . . . basically a peaceful person , " who did n't want to kill but was forced to by the howling demons who tormented him . He insisted that " Sam , " the devil , would soon be victimizing other people , creating new Sons of Sam , and he wanted to warn the world of this danger . He spoke briefly about his discomforts in the hospital . He was particularly bothered by the fact that he was n't allowed to brush his teeth more than once a day and could n't use shampoo for his hair . He had to use a brown soap which , for his fastidious taste , was not efficient enough . On her next few visits with Richard , Roslyn had to limit her time to a half hour . After that , he was no longer able to maintain normal contact . He became restless and agitated . He jammed his fist into his cheek and rubbed it around nervously . He thrust his head forward and shifted his eyes from side to side , as if someone were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to go now ? " he answered , " Yes , " with obvious relief . Betty 's first visit to her son did not take place until October 31 . One thing that kept them apart was concern about the emotional effect such a visit would have on Betty , whose health was poor . Another thing was fear that reporters might hound them again , once news of an impending visit leaked out . It was imperative to postpone Betty 's visit until some of the feverish feelings cooled down . By October 31 , Roslyn and lawyers agreed it would be " safe ' arrange a meeting between mother son . The visit was brief and pleasthough somewhat strained . Although glad to see her again , Richard found it hard to look his mother directly in eye . She brought him some books stationery . They spoke only about most superficial things . At the end of visit , still not looking at her , he quietly , " Well , Ma , how do you like mess I 'm in ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roslyn and her mother turned home , they found the apart : complex once again swarming ' - reporters and the doorbell rang all night long . During November . Roslyn continued to N him whenever possible - witnessed his steady ph. cal and mental deteric tion . He lost a great de : : ' : weight . His eyes , under ! : with heavy black bags , into his pale face . The r ent David Berkowitz , looked like a sickly old r barely resembled the robust , - blue-eyed young man had been arrested months before . He experienced recuring episodes of shrieking , rant ing and flailing , which hospital treated with straight . jackets and heavy sedate . He continued to be torts. by his " demons . " He pleaded desperately to his lawyers , " Please help me ! " And to his sister Roz he said , " I do n't think I can make it through this . " During one of his mo calm and rational period in November 1977 , he wr to his mother saying t1 these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doubtful if would ever be able to spe time with her and the fa ily again . Early in December , Richard came to a shockngi awareness . After half a ye of confinement and ment , the demons were fa ing away . He suddenly u derstood that he had do something terribly wrong that he had killed all tho people for no good reason As the reality of what had done penetrated h consciousness , he found could not bear to live wi himself . In the next fe tension-filled weeks , both the lawyers and the two families dealt with the ve real possibility that he migh attempt to commit suicide But unpredictable as a ways , Richard gradually a @# ur 1 st could corm : "  | justed coming to terms with himself and his future . How did this come about ? An influence from his past re-entered his life , giving him the strength to survive . His next letters to his family were imbued with his neu obsession . In January 1978 , he wrote his mother , " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and urged her to pu : herself in God 's bands . About the same time , he wrote to Roz and Leo that he 'd been busy reading his Bible and praying . In February 1978 , he wrote his mother that something wonderful had happened in his life . He had found the Messiah of Israel , Jesus Christ , " . . . and we love each other . That 's right ? I believe Jesus is the saviour of the world for both Jews and Gentiles and with this I have a new hope . In fact , I have great hope that you will one day find Christ and get saved . I know it 's hard to fathom now , yet I am certain that one day Mrs. Betty Falco will shine as a light in the darkness to all her Jewish friends . I am certain that in the years to come ? you Morn , will become a Christian . " Please Morn , pour your heart out to God . I'ni crying now . Love you forever , Richard " During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her son again because of the hard time the press gave her after the first visit . Roslyn was unable to get back to him for a long time . After eight months of psychiatric examinations . judicial hearings , appeals and delays , he was still in his cell at Kings County Hospital , waiting for a decision about his future . On March 21 , 1978 , Roslyn was allowed to spend a full hour with him . For months he had been visited by no one except his lawyers and a woman Baptist who came to him twice a week for Bible-study sessions . He was truly thrilled to see his sister . During the visit he was very emotional and cried often . " Every few minutes he asked about the kids , and told me how he missed them . He kept saying , I miss you , " " l love you , " l think about you and Mom and the girls every nigh : and I cry . ' " Now there were no more demons , " continues Roslyn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like himself again . But even though he was no longer tortured by demons , he was suffering . His suffering was even worse now , because he realized what he did , how horrible it was . He knows what he did was wrong and he is sorry for it . He ca n't express enough how sorry he is . He keeps saying it over and over and he cries . " I tried to tell him , You were n't really yourself , you could n't help yourself ? ' Then he held up his hands and said But these two hands did it . ' Again I told him , You were n't in control of your hands . ' But he feels completely responsible . " He did not want the onus of responsibility removed from his shoulders by a verdict of " innocent by reason of insanity . " The suggestion of insanity was always a sore point with him ? he denied it from the start . He told his psychiatrists that the demons " were real , too real to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He told Roslyn he wanted to plead guilty and go to prison . It appeared to Roslyn that what held him together , for the moment at least , was his belief in Jesus and his passion to make believers of everyone he knew . " I love you , " he told Roslyn . " Jesus loves all of us . We are still a family even though we ca n't be together any more . " Then he implored her , " Please try to believe in Jesus , because when we die we 'll all be in heaven together as a family . " He was not blind to the bleakness of his future . " My life is over , " he admitted to Roslyn . And he was also aware of the risks if he went to a regular prison , where he would be a hated inmate . " I do n't know what my chances are in prison , " he said to Roslyn . " I know there are a bunch of kooks there . " In his last letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersed more deeply than ever in his religious thoughts . He wrote of the woman minister who came to read the Bible with him and quoted Psalm 27 , " The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? " Psalm 31 , " In thee , 0 Lord , do I put my trust ; let me never be  | ashamed : deliver me in Thy righteousness . " Psalm 38 , " Fr I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin . " He concluded , " I hope these passages will bless your life dearest family . Love , Richie " On May 8 , 1978 , David Berkowitz , against the advice o his lawyers , pleaded guilty to all the .44-caliber shootings His plea was accepted by all three judges . Once again , the media described him as coldly unem tional , speaking in a monotone , showing no remorse . Onc more , the public was presented with the image of a one dimensional fiend . For his victims ' families , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only true justice would be the death penalty . Ironically , Roslyn had begun to agree with them . The year-long ordeal had taken a severe physical and emotional toll on her mother . For the second time , Betty was losing her son ? and this time , forever . Betty was surviving , but just barely , by clinging to the hope that her son had at las : found peace with his new religion . But Roslyn did not have much faith that he had found a really permanent " peace " in his obsession with Jesus . Rather , she saw his new " religion " in much the same way defense psychiatrist Dr. Lubin saw it : just another aspect of his psychosis . Her instincts told her that his idea about his new " mission in life " ? to preach the Gospel to other prisoners ? was just another form of the hallucinations that were a fundamental symptom of his whole mental disorder Even as early as May 8 , there were indications that the slim thread by which he was holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes , witnessed by psychiatrists . Richard had uncontrollable fits of rage whenever he felt he was losing his grip on Jesus . He had even begun to clout , : the trustworthiness of his beloved lady minister . Roslyn did not believe there was any possibility for a cure for her brother or any way for him , ever again , to lead a meaningful or happy life . Above all , Roslyn understood , with compassion , the bitterness and grief that led the victims ' families to desire her brother 's death . " I look at my own two girls , " she said quietly , in a weary aftermath of the legal hearings , " and I wonder how I would feel if the same thing happened to me . . . . I think I would probably feel exactly the same way . ' But the death penalty does not exist in New York State and the living reality of their nightmare will always remair. a part of Roslyn 's and Betty 's lives . On July 5 , 1978 , almost a full year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court and sentenced to a term of 25 years to life for each of his victims . Once a year ( perhaps more often if they find the strength and the money ) , Roslyn will escort her mother on the 5 ' /2-hour trip upstate to Richard 's prison home and , there , they will again relive the pain of the past . Between visits , they will try to continue the business of living ? raising a family . struggling with everyday problems , enjoying life 's simple pleasures . But how can Roslyn totally block out of her mind her brother 's tragically wasted life and . his horrendous legacy ? How can Betty ever forget what her son once meant to her ? She knows she is not his mother in the legal sense . A : the time of his arrest , she had known him only two out of his 24 years . Nonetheless , in that brief period , he became a son to her . She felt close to him and loved him . Her bond to him was too strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was now one of the most hated and infamous criminals of all time could not alter her motherly instincts , her deep attachment . O n the day he pleaded guilty to six murders , David Berkowitz entreated his lawyers to help him purchase a Mother 's Day card to send to Betty . As he had done every year since the day he found her , he wanted to wish her a Happy Mother 's Day . Betty Falco found it in her mailbox on May 13 , 1978 . It was a simple , elegant card , and had a handwritten message : " Dear Mom , Please remember that I love you and will always love you throughout eternity . I will never forger you . Love , Richard " She read it . And she cried .
