Women : " Great to Be Alive " <P> To the Editors : <P> The comment on the Women 's Conference at Houston Dec. 5 that " it is a particularly exciting time to be a woman " had a traumatic effect on me . I have been involved in the suffrage movement since 1909 , first in London and then in Alaska and on to the present day . What a change there has been in the kind of militant action called for now compared to what our sisters were compelled to experience in England in the early years of this century . <P> It is great to be alive today ! <P> Jessie Bloom <P> Seattle <P> At the National Women 's Conference the delegates traded in their Bibles for Aldous Huxley 's Brave New World and a further psychological castration of masculinity . Test-tube babies , artificial wombs and government nurseries will finally give women the equality and the control over their own bodies they seem to desire so much . <P> Kenneth Quade <P> Pembine , Wis . <P> I hope it is written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being a delegate from the state of Illinois to the National Women 's Conference 1977 . <P> JoAnn R. Horowitz <P> Chicago <P> I do not know how many votes the women 's movement gained in Houston . I do know that by espousing lesbianism it lost one former supportive vote . <P> J. Stanley Cook <P> Bradenton , Fla . <P> Seeing Rosalynn , Betty and Lady Bird , the politicians ' wives , looking upper-crusty , and the many other women in Houston looking like fools , I concluded hat I was viewing long-ago plays about ; he aristocracy and the jesters who per-brmed and danced before them . <P> Lucy Profumo <P> Louisville <P> Right on National Plan of Action sisters ! Even though we know you do n't need us , there are thousands and dare I say millions of American men who are behind you 100% in your struggle for freedom , equality and dignity . <P> Our consciousness and numbers are growing too . <P> Terry Cosgrove <P> Urbana , Ill . <P> So , the women at Houston wanted the right to tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them at the same time to call for federally funded programs for victims of child abuse . What selfish , twisted logic . <P> Kay Sheldon <P> Simpsonville , S.C . <P> Any woman who exercises her right to vote , any woman who exercises her right to an education , any woman who exercises her right to work is a feminist . Phyllis Schlafly is one of the leaders of ultraconservative feminism . Let 's get our semantics right . <P> Fay Angus <P> Sierra Madre , Calif . <P> I could tolerate the unutterably silly Houston conference but for the fact that I was taxed to fund it . <P> Richard Sutcliffe <P> Little Neck , N. Y. <P> The Middle East Peace Plan <P> Your article " Toward a Just Peace : A formula that offers attainable goals " Dec. 5 is the best and most daring I have seen on the Middle East . But you did not mention how to initiate it . <P> I envisage a scene of two people standing beside a pool filled with ice water , hesitating to jump in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that such a push should come from Mr. Carter-on behalf of all the sympathizers of Israel in the U.S. - and others who are sick and tired of continuous war in the Holy Land . <P> George Haig <P> Washington , D.C.
