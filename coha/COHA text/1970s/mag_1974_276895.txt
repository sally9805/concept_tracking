The U.S. is afflicted by a massive economic migraine , and more than 200 million Americans know too well just how much it hurts . Their incomes , savings and life-styles are being assailed by a whole group of aches and pains . There is feverish inflation , constriction of credit and throbbingly high interest rates . The stock market has scarcely been so shaky since 1929 . Just about everybody who buys , sells , borrows or invests has that overall feeling of unease . And there is no fast , fast relief in sight . <P> The attack of problems seems to be almost diabolically coordinated . Inflation drives up interest rates ; then money flees Wall Street to pursue the higher interest rates , pushing stock prices down further ; then the high cost of borrowing and the impossibility of selling new stock issues in a collapsing market make it difficult for companies to raise the money needed to expand or in some cases even to stay alive , thus intensifying the threat of recession-or worse . <P> President Ford says that he is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his credit , he concedes that the doctoring will be long and painful . At his first presidential press conference last week , Ford once again declared that inflation is the nation 's primary problem-or , in his metaphor , " public enemy No. 1 . " He vowed to make a start on fighting it by cutting at least $5.5 billion out of the federal budget for fiscal 1975 , now in its third month . Though he earlier had talked against " unwarranted " cuts in military spending , he asserted this time that " no budget for any department is sacrosanct , and that includes the Defense budget . " When asked what advice he could give the American worker confronted by soaring rises in the price of everything , Ford offered only bleak counsel : emulate the belt-tightening example of the Administration and " watch every penny . " <P> Dreading Retirement . For tens of millions of citizens , the admonition was not only grim but superfluous : they are already being forced into penny watching on a scale they have not experienced in decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average American worker have climbed 7.4% , but retail prices have risen much faster ; the average paycheck now buys 4.6% less goods and services than a year ago . That is a drop in the purchasing power of Americans without any parallel in the whole post-World War II period . Pensioners are caught in such a merciless squeeze between higher prices and fixed incomes that some aging workers who had looked forward to retirement are now dreading and trying to postpone it . Middle-class people are being pushed into such demeaning economies as buying clothes at rummage sales and cutting contributions to their churches . Two small but indicative examples of inflation 's ravages from Boston alone : Bill Collector Brian Fairbend is having a tough time making ends meet because more of the inflation-pressed consumers he duns are willing to be taken to court rather than pay up immediately , and the sick in Massachusetts General Hospital no longer have all the sheets on their beds changed every day because hospital administrators figure that they can not afford it .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
