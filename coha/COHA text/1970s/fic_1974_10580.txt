big it must wear her down sometimes just carrying it around . The two of us , we 're real glad you college students have come out to return thanks with us today , in fact you 're part of what we got to be thankful for most . I know there 's lots as do n't go in for your long hair and your beards and all that , but like I said to Gertrude Conover the other day , Gertrude Conover there was a time the boys used to go around looking like cowboys and moving picture stars . Nowadays they go around looking like Jesus . Boys , I 'm here to tell you for my money that 's a change in the right direction . " You could smell the turkey . Several waiters had come in with water pitchers , and you could hear the velvety rattle of ice against silver . Gertrude Conover stood beside the black in the striped kaftan . She held her head a little to one side , and from the back her slip was showing . I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went along . He said , " Friends , I know you 're all waiting for me to wind this up so you can sit down and start piling it in , but first let me unload something I 've got on my chest . I 'm going to be open and above-board with you , and the long and the short of it is this . Gertrude Conover and me , we expected a bigger turn-out today , a lot bigger . There 's no point in the world trying to pretend different . Why , we got gobbler and gravy and candy yams out there enough to feed this pack for a week and still have enough left over for a church supper . We got ice cream in special that 's made like turkeys and pilgrim hats . We got pots of coffee keeping hot that 's enough to float this piano if you poured it all in one place . Even if we all was to eat up till it started repeating on us something wicked , it would n't hardly make a dent on what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ! What a waste of a warm and loving heart like Gertrude Conover'swho put this spread on ! Most of all , what a waste of a day the Almighty made on purpose for sharing together the bread that strengtheneth man 's heart and the wine that maketh it glad . " Bebb took a quick , deep breath , and I thought I saw something falter inside his face as if for the first time since he had started , he did n't know what he was going to say next  --  or do next  --  and for one moment , out of the same cackling abyss from which laughter threatens to break out at funerals , there arose within me a vision of Bebb doing as he had done in front of the children at Miami Beach and in front of the Indians at Holy Love : there on the baronial staircase of Revonoc exposing his final secret  --  opening , sharing , shriving himself down to the naked and nethermost truth to the Pepsi generation . His eye-lid fluttered , but that was all . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one of you know it . It 's a story did n't come into my mind till just now while I was standing here . It seems like someways the  --  there 's times you least expect it when the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered . " You know the story I mean , " Bebb said , wiping the back of his neck with his handkerchief . " It 's the story of the great supper . Luke fourteen sixteen . Jesus , he told it . He told it one Sabbath at a Pharisee 's house . The way Jesus spun it out , seems there was a man once that decided to throw a big do . He invited everybody he could think of and some others he 'd never of got round to thinking of without he wanted to make sure there would n't be a soul left off the list by accident . He got inp52the food and fancied up his house . He hired a band to play through dinner . Finally the day come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man waited for the company to start turning up . Only it never did . All that turned up was a batch of excuses . There was one sent word he could n't make it on account of he 'd bought him a herd of cows he had to look after . There was another could n't make it seeing as how he 'd just got married and the bride did n't want him to leave her high and dry on the honeymoon , and so on . So the man took all that kind of thing he could take , and then he just flared up . He called in his servant , and he told him to go out into the streets of the town and haul in whoever he saw did n't look like they had anything better to do . The servant went and did it only even after everybody had sat down the man still saw empty chairs around the table , so this time he sent the servant out into the country and told him not to bother coming back till he found enough people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found were the down-and-outest specimens you can imagine . The servant did like the man said , and you never saw such a pack of lame ducks and has-beens as he brought back with him , but there was party hats and snappers to go round , and everybody had the time of their life . That was how the great supper finally come off . " Friends , " Bebb said , and he was glistening now where his sideburns would have been if he 'd had sideburns , and his mouth was snapping open and shut like a slot machine hopper when the jackpot starts shooting out . " Friends , there must be ninety and nine places in this room with nobody to sit down in them , and Princeton , New Jersey , must be full as any town of people who do n't have a place on earth to go for Thanksgiving . Sop53what are we waiting for ? Brothers and sisters , if we shake the dust off our shoe-leather and take off all of us in different directions , we can be back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the Pope 's nose . " Come , " said Bebb , spreading his arms so wide that his jacket strained at the single button that held it . " Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God . " If it was partly the power of Bebb 's oratory that made the thing catch fire , it was partly also the power of Gertrude Conover 's claret punch . One cup packed the wallop of two martinis , and during the long wait before Bebb 's speech many cups had been emptied . Bebb deployedus like J. Edgar Hoover  --  some to the campus and some to the Seminary and the Westminster Choir School , some to upper Nassau Street and some as far down as Jugtown , others to Witherspoon , Mercer , Prospect , and so on . Even the musicians and several waiters volunteered to join in the search . Bebb took as many as Gertrude Conover 's Lincoln would hold and dropped them off at their appointed beats along the way before proceeding on by himself to cover the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those with assignments closer by went off on foot , some of them running . The reporter from the Daily Princetonian stood out on the front steps getting action shots . Gertrude Conover stayed behind to see if she could round up anybody by telephone . Somehow the turkeys were kept warm . As for me , I ended up by the Palmer Square tiger full of claret and half convinced that either I was dreaming the whole thing or was having a nervous breakdown . Thep54supper of the great God , Bebb had said , with his jacket button almost popping off but everything else mercifully buttoned up , zipped up , in place ; and I thought how that made me some kind of apocalyptic wino almost certain as I accosted total strangers to be taken for a middle-aged degenerate or con artist . How did you invite people to a parable ? Whom did you invite ? I had the dream-like feeling that anybody might show up including the dead and that if the dead showed up there on Palmer Square , it would turn out as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't really dead at all . As I stood by the tiger wondering how to proceed from there , I half expected to see old Herman Redpath padding up from the Post Office in his chocolate brown suit and broad-brimmed circuit-rider 's hat , or Lucille in French heels and a furpiece that had seen better days . I could even imagine coming on my twin sister , Miriam , not at the age she was when she died but as she was when we were children together in New York and used to sit at the window of our apartment watching the home-bound traffic move slowly up Park Avenue through the winter dusk . I do n't think for years I missed her as much as I did then , and if I could have called back any ghost out of history to Bebb 's party , it was Miriam 's I would have called . There 's been this mix-up on Gouverneur Road .. . There 's this rich lady named Gertrude Conover . . . I know it sounds crazy , but .... One after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off down the square . November , that bleakest of all months  --  in October Englishmen shoot grouse , in November themselves , as the grim French jest goes  --  and never was itp55much bleaker than just then with the streets virtually empty and the raw , grey air . There was a family of three coming down the steps from the Nassau Inn  --  a mother and a father and their teen-age son  --  but using the excuse that they looked as though they 'd just had their dinner , I decided against approaching them . On a balconyover one of the shops a woman in a polo coat was setting out two pots of dead ivy , but she had disappeared inside by the time I got close enough to call up to her . There was a man sweeping the floor inside the liquor store and I knocked at the window , but he thought I wanted to come in and buy something and shook his head at me . Farther down , a boy and a girl were standing in front of the Playhouse reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange and black scarf wrapped several times around her neck , and the boy had hair down to his shoulders and was holding a fox terrier on a leash . I tried to explain to them what I was after , but they got it turned around somehow , or I did , with the result that they thought I was asking for a handoutinstead of offering them one , and although they were very nice about it , they indicated they were broke themselves . It was n't until I reached the big parking lot at the bottom of the square that I finally succeeded in getting my pitch straight , and of all the people in New Jersey I might have found to make it to , the one it turned out to be was Nancy Oglethorpe . It is as hard for me to believe there was a time in my life when I had never heard of Nancy Oglethorpe as it is to believe there was a time in my life when I 'd never heard of religion or sex . It is also hard for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even such unpromising specimens as myself are capable of pre/cognition  --  I did n't feel the slightest vibration or astral twinge of things to come when Nancy Oglethorpe came into my view for the first time . Maybe it was because she came into it backwards . She was climbing into one of the parked cars so that the first view I had of her was of a pair of fat legs seen from behind with the stockings rolled up six inches or so above the knee . She had on a poison green coat with fur collar and cuffs , and she was carrying an enormous black patent leather purse . She had some kind of black scarf tied around her head and under her chin , but in the process of getting into the car , she knocked it off and it fell to the ground . Stepping back out again , she picked it up and placed it between her teeth while she dug in the big purse for her keys . When she turned around to do this , she still had the scarf in her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of a woman with a luxuriant black beard . It was only when she removed the scarf from her teeth that I could see her face . Those soft , dark , football shaped eyes , that great Babel of a nose , that small scarlet seam of a mouth and milky skin , it was pure Mesopotamian , the face of some Sumerian soubrette or Babylonian beauty queen . Her black hair was teased up into a giant beehive except where silken sideburns descended flat about her ears . Even under the folds of her green coat the hanging gardens of her bosom jutted verdant and proud , her hips swelling like the bass fiddle at Belshazzar 's feast , and yet for all of this , she tapered down to surprisingly shapely calves and ankles and a pair of almost dainty patent leather feet . Lachaise could have sculpted her or Michelangelolaid her on over eight square feet of Sistinep57ceiling , but to do her full justice it would have taken some ancient near-Easterner working on a sun-baked wall in Ur . I was about to speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice that sounded as though she might never have been nearer the ancient near east than Canarsie she spoke to me instead . " Pardon me for asking , " Nancy Oglethorpe said , " but do you happen to know if there 's any place still serving lunch ? " " It 's a funny thing you should ask , " I said , " because it just happens that  --  " and so on , with the chill breeze swaying her behive and making my nose water while in the background the dreaming towers of Princeton went on with their grey November dream . It was almost too easy , and as soon as I 'd finished explaining Bebb 's problemto her , she made it easier still . She said , " This is positively providential , and I accept with pleasure I 'm sure . I was supposed to meet a gentlemanat the Nass , but he did n't show , and by the time I decided to go in without him they told me the dining room was closed , would n't you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe pick up some others on the way . Believe me , this town is full of displaced persons . " And so it was that I ended up in Nancy Oglethorpe 's Chevvy with the shocks gone and a tubercular rattle under the hood , looking for strangers to fill out the ranks at Revonoc . She drove , and I looked . We cruised down Witherspoon as far as the hospital , then threaded our way back through a lot of narrow side streets . After hearing me bumble my way through the first couple of solicitations , Nancy took over the talking . An old Negro inching his way along John Street in an aluminum walker , a woman with a child coming out of a laundro/mat , a graduate student with a bad stammer whom Nancy Oglethorpe turned out to have done some work for once , a pair of nuns who were attending an ecumenicalconference at the Seminary  --  her approach with each of them was the same . She would pull up to the curb , roll down the window , and then make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a favor " and the closing one " Do yourself a favor " and sandwiched between them a synopsis of the situation on Gouverneur Road presented with such breezy eloquence  --  those Assyrianeyes , that hanging garden  --  that by the time we hit Nassau Street again , we had a full car . Most of the others had returned before we did , and the hall of Revonoc was crowded with people . By three thirty or four the somber afternoon had started deepeningto twilight , and lamps were lit , the chandelier that hung down from the top of the stairwell seeding the waxed fruit and polished glasses with pearls of light . The orchestra went back into business with musical comedy  --  HelloDolly , The Rain in Spain , Vilia . The punch bowl was replenished . Young and old , black and white , town and gown  --  " Antonio , it 's Noah 's ark , " Bebb said to me at some point . " We got two of everything , only here it 's the clean and the unclean both . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet as many as he could when they first came in . The heart of Gertrude Conover 's as big as all outdoors . You young people are the hope of the future . It 's a great school , a great town , a great time to be alive . Bebb 's cheeks swelled out as if with the effort to hold all his phrases in his mouth at once while he popped them out one by one like water/melon seeds . Praise the Lord , brother , Halleluiah , sister , and chattering in the overexcited cadence of flood victimsin a Red Cross soup kitchen they eddied around through the turkey-laden air . Gertrude Conover had had some success on the phone , and there was a fair sprinklingof blue hair and pearls among what was a mostly young to middle-aged miscellany with the young predominatingand decidedly more Elizabethan than Edwardian , more Woodstock than Gouverneur Road . Ants and anteaters , cats and dogs , lambs and lions , they were all stabled together there in uproarious harmony while outside the chill sky darkened . The elation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball in the movie house sing-alongs of my youth . He was pulling something off and he knew he was and everybody there would know it if they stopped to think back on it later . I knew it myself except that maybe from my Italian mother , maybe from a sour stomach , I inherit a possibly fatal taste for doom so that even at the height of carnival it is always the valediction that ends up drowningout the carnality , the sense of old time a-flying that keeps me from savoring as I only wish I could even the choicest rosebuds that come my way for gathering . There at Bebb 's finest hour I could not help thinking that once the punch bowl was empty for good and the food ran out , we would all go back to our accustomed diet , which was each other . And I could n't help thinking too of how even the supper of the great God was a less than adequatesubstitute for the supper of my small son and estranged wife sitting in Sutton with the TV on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink , and a combination of smells in that cluttered kitchen that were like no other smells on earth becausep60they were for better or worse the smells of my own life . In a way Bebb spoke to this when the time came , among the other things he spoke to . The time came more or less when the ice cream did , the turkeys and pilgrim hats Bebb had mentioned earlier , only starting to go a little soft and shapeless by the time they finally made it to the table . Bebb rose from his seat and spoke from there rather than climbing up to the orchestra landing as before . On one side of him sat the old black whose aluminum walker we had managed to squeeze into the trunk of Nancy Oglethorpe 's Chevvy , on his other side a man in a Norfolk jacket who presumably had come with one of the blue-haired ladies . Bebb talked a long time  --  it must have been five years since the last time he had had a congregation that big and who knew how long it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they listened to him , you could tell  --  listened to him partly , I suppose , because what he said , he said in his high style and partly because although as a teetotaler he had n't touched a drop of Gertrude Conover'sclaret punch , he was drunk on the occasion and spoke in such a disconnected way that you had to listen if only to hear what he was going to bounce to next . I remember in fragments what he said because he said it in fragments . He said , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a great feast . That 's the way of it . The Kingdom of Heaven is a love feast where nobody 's a stranger . Like right here . There 's strangers everywheres else you can think of . There 's strangers was born out of the same womb . There 's strangers was raised together in the same town and worked side by side all their life through . There'sp61strangers got married and been climbing in and out of the same fourposter together for thirty-five or forty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like most of the time he is a stranger too . Even when he 's near as the end of your nose , people make like he 's nowhere around . They wo n't talk to him . They wo n't listen to him . They keep their eye on the ground . But here in this place there 's no strangers , and Jesus , he is n't a stranger either . The Kingdom of Heaven 's like this . " He said , " We all got secrets . I got them same as everybody else  --  things we feel bad about and wish had n't ever happened . Hurtful things . We 're all scared and lonesome , but most of the time we keep it hid . It 's like every one of us has lost his way so bad we do n't even know which way is home any more only we 're ashamed to ask . You know what would happen if we would own up we 're lost and ask ? Why , what would happen is we 'd find out home is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves us lost or found or any whichway . " The room flickered like the scratched print of an old newsreel , the hands of Bebb jerky as Woodrow Wilson laying a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier . Shadows . Faces . Afros like puff balls of dust under beds , more air than hair . Grainy , light-struck blizzarding of old film . Bebb said , " Eating . Feeding your face . Folks , I 've eaten my way ' round the known world . I 've eaten snails out of their own shells in Paris , France . I 've eaten octopus in Spain and curry in India so hot it makes your eyes water and the skin on your head go cold as ice . I 've eaten hamburgs pitiful and grey like the sole of your shoe in greasy spoons from here to Saint Joe . I 've eaten the bread of affliction , all of us has . We got to eat orp62food , it 's life , but all the food in the world , all the turkey and fixings plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not life enough to keep you alive without you eat it with love in the heart . " Dear hearts , " Bebb said , " we got to love one another and Jesus or die guessing . " Bebb said , " I was n't born yesterday . I 'm not kidding myself what we got going here is a hundred percent guaranteed to last forever . There 's nothing in this world lasts forever . That 's the miserable sadness of it . Time will be when the party 's over . Time will be when all the good times of our life is over because they are like grass which in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up and in the evening is cut down and withereth . Time is the enemy , and the tick of the clock is the sound his toenails make pattering up on us for the kill . Friends , while we 're still sitting here feeling good let us promise to remember how for a little bit of time we loved each other in this place . Even when the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with Jesus . " Where did Bebb 's speech begin ? Where did it end ? The whole gathering was Bebb 's speech , his parable , and everything that happened and was said there by anybody was in a way part of what Bebb said . I do n't know who started the singing , but there was singing . There was Onward Christian Soldiers and Going Back to Nassau Hall and We Shall Overcome . There was Swing Low Sweet Chariot , The Orange and the Black , Roll out the Barrel , and Blowin ' in the Wind . There was a toast to Gertrude Conover proposed by Bebb and followed by a great deal of whistling and table-thumping during which Gertrude Conover stood up in her green dress like a small , lopsided Christmas tree . There was Bebb 's sayingp63that before we got up from the table we should all join hands and sing Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow . When this worked as well as it did , he proposed that we follow ancient procedure and exchange with the neighbor to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hush , a silent passing of the angel of death over our heads , and then Bebb turned to the old Negro beside him . He took that black face between his hands , held it for a few seconds like a mirror he was studying his own face in , and then tipped it forwarduntil at some particular point in time which for all I know was a point appointed before the world began , those tight , relentless lips and that corrugated black forehead met . Then everybody got into the act . If you added together all the hugging and squeezing and shoulder-pounding that have taken place on Gouverneur Road since the Continental Congress sat in Nassau Hall , I doubt you would have come close to what took place at Revonoc during the next five minutes or so . Boys who looked like Jesus kissed blue-haired ladies and girls out of Charles Addams cartoons , kissed other boys who looked like Jesus . Old tigers with prostates and hearing aids kissed short order cooks and retired policemen . Nuns kissed Daughters of the American Revolutionand stammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly buttons down the outside of their flies kissed Abe Lincolns welted with acne , Midwestern fairies , and vestals from Miss Fine 's and Westminster Choir . Seen from the landing it must have looked like some ancient Roman orgy as filmed by D. W. Griffith , a writhing Bacchanal with lions roaring from the arena below and Claudette Colbert taking a bath in mother 's milk . The band played ragtime , asp64unknown to the merrymakers the great ship slowly started to go down . Nancy Oglethorpe . Somewhere out of the maelstrom Nancy Oglethorpe rose up in white and gold like an iceberg , and at the sound of her voice the room grew still . " Jesus ... Jesus ! " she called out . She made it sound as though Jesus was taking his time in the washroomand a taxi was waiting outside with the meter on . There were people long afterwards who said that Nancy Oglethorpe was a plant and that she and Bebb had cooked the whole thing up ahead of time . I do not believe that . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had cooked it up . With her eyes lowered , her towering beehive tilted slightly forward , she looked as though she was saying a prayer except that she seemed to be saying it to us rather than to Jesus and in a voice that sounded less like Saint Therese of Lisieux than like a New York telephone operator . There was something of the TV commercial in the way she did it : first the real-life scenes of irregularity  --  the headache , the irritability , the loss of pep  --  and then the helpful friend with the knowing smile and the family-size remedy . The first thing Nancy Oglethorpe did was tell her story . She said she was thirty years old . She was unmarried . She had to work for a living . She had started out as a public stenographer at the Pennsylvania Hotel in Manhattan , but she was attracted to Princeton because of its rich cultural opportunities and decided to try her hand there instead . I remember thinking of her immersingp65Herself in the rich cultural opportunities of Princeton like Bathsheba settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye on her : Nancy Oglethorpe signing up for the chamber music series at McCarter ; Nancy Oglethorpe auditing a graduate course in cultural antitropology ; Nancy Oglethorpe in flat heels and a corduroyjumper exchanging views on Kafka and women 's lib at faculty cocktail parties . She said that as time went by she found that the greatest call for her services came from the Grad School  --  dissertations to type , footnotes to check , bibliographiesto compile  --  and since much of this required the presence if not of her employers themselves at least of their books and index cards , she made it a practice of coming to their rooms to do her work . Like Florence Nightingale moving through the wounded with her lamp , I pictured Nancy Oglethorpe entering the kind of academic squalor I remembered from my own university clays  --  the unmade bed and mad scientist desk , the glutted ashtray , the petrified coffee at the bottom of plastic cups  --  and there in the midst of it Nancy Oglethorpestanding in a cloud of patchouli with those eyes as sweet and dark as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and pats the beehive back into shape . She removes the poison green coat like the seventhveil and drapes it over the back of an eviscerated armchair . At this point in her narrative Nancy Oglethorpe paused , and the level of silence in the great hall of Revonoc clicked up a notch . You could hear it . All those faces turned toward her . That whole hymn singing , yamstuffedmob frozen in their tracks like the court of the Sleeping Beauty . Bebb with his neck twisted like ap66cruller so he could see her over his shoulder . A lady with pixie glasses and a harelip . Prince Valiant smoking a joint . Uncle Remus in a sheepskin Afghanistan vest trimmed with sequins and yeti fur . The dowagers of Gouverneur Road and Lilac Lane . " I was a mere child , " she said . " I did n't know what I was getting into . The flesh is weak . " Nancy Oglethorpe not dry behind the ears yet , those ears that glittered now with jewels like spoonfuls of fruit salad . The flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze that wafted the scent of Susanna to the elders ' ravening nostrils , that same flesh that rose among us now in all its chryselephantine prime . " I started having affairs , " Nancy Oglethorpe said . " I have been leading an extremely promiscuous existence ever since to say the least . " Affairs with Nancy Oglethorpe . It would have needed Solomon himself to sing the song of them , I thought . Her navel like a round goblet which wanteth not liquor , her belly like a heap of wheat set about with lilies , the smell of her nose like apples . I pictured her on that unmade scholar 's bed like a great mound of yoghurt , her electric typewriter forgottenon the littered desk . " But that 's all a thing of the past now , " she said . " I 'm making a clean breast of it to you . I 'm making a clean breast of it to Jesus . " The breast of Nancy Oglethorpe clean as a hillside of new snow , a Beautyrest made up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I was watching her as she stood there in the glitter of Gertrude Conover 's chandelier . In the event that he had answered her summons and was present there on Gouverneur Road with the rest of us , would he see whatever the bees inside that hive were up to that had prompted her to this public confession ? And howp67would Nancy Oglethorpe see Jesus , I wondered , rememberingfrom catechism class a homily to the effect that if Shakespeare were to walk into a room , everybody would automatically stand up whereas if Jesus did , everybody would automatically kneel down  --  Nancy Oglethorpe melting to the floor like ice cream , the nuns melting , the Afros , all of us . Nancy Oglethorpe was saying , " I have n't been able to look myself in the eye for seven years . I wanted to sever connections with the past and make a fresh start , but psychological factors having to do with long-term patterns of behavior and the unfortunate reputation I have acquired in certain circles plus the fact that my professionalwork is constantly exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , these have all contributed to making it problematical at best that I could ever change . I have been like a rat caught in a trap . Then out of the blue I got invited here . I 've never been a religious person vis-a-vis church and Jesus et cetera , but right here in this room it hit me like a bolt out of the blue . " Nancy Oglethorpe paused and smiled . It was the first time I 'd seen those tiny teeth . Her zeppelin eyes were so charged with whatever she was smiling at that they looked almost goiterish . " Frankly , " she said , " what did Jesus ever mean to me before this ? All this rhubarb about the blood of the lamb and what have you , to be perfectly frank I never related to it . " Her voice got smaller and more precise then as if she was working on a stencil and did n't want to have to go back and make corrections . She said , " The gentleman I had a luncheon date with today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like cold water in the face when a thing like that happens . There I was , dressed up in clothes appropriate top68the occasion only to have the props kicked right out from under me . Then this total stranger appeared and asked me here , and I confess my motives in accepting him were extremely mixed , to put it mildly . But it 's like Reverend Bebb has so well expressed it . Nobody 's aj stranger . That stranger who came up to me in the parking lot was no stranger . He was Jesus , as it were . Jesus sent him there to pick me up . " She clasped her hands at her bosom as though she was going to sing the rest . " Jesus has come into my life to stay , " she said . " I am through with the past . I am through with not daring to let my right hand know what my left hand is up to . Jesus did it for me , and I want to give him and Reverend Bebb some small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think I have found the way . I think the way is we should go on having get-togethers like this on a regular basis . I think we owe it to Jesus to share with other persons this salvation-type experience we have had here today . " I think , " said Nancy Oglethorpe , slowly sweeping the room with her glance , " I think we should try tomake Princeton , New Jersey , one big love feast for Jesus . " There is no power on earth , they say , that can stop an idea when its time has come , and there at Revonoc that November afternoon there was no power that even tried to stop it . After the failure of Open Heart , the burning of the barn , and those four sad and footloose years that followed it , Bebb had finally managed to open a heart to Jesus , and partly because the time was ripe but partly also because the heart he opened was Nancy Oglethorpe'sheart , history was made that day on Gouverneur Road.  |p69LIFE  MUST GO ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose death also must go on , the two of them hand in hand like old playmates . Life was Bebb , it seemed to me then  --  Bebb launched on a brilliant new career with Nancy Oglethorpe and Gertrude Conover both beside him at the tiller , Bebb poised to evangelize Princeton , New Jersey , to set up the Supper of the Lamb in the groves of academe . And death was me returning to Mrs. Gunther 's boarding house in Sutton , Connecticut , was me driving to school past the house where my wife and son lived as if I had died there . As a ghost I was more haunted than haunting since if either of them marked my spectral passing at about quarter to eight every morn/ing , they gave no sign of it . If from deep inside the house they saw me , I had the feeling that what they saw must be as transparent as the reflection of my own face in the car window that I searched for them through . My arrangement with Sharon was that for the time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case anyway that seemed a redundance . Even if she had wanted to , I could n't believe there would be enough of me for Sharon to see . I was free to see Bill whenever I liked , but it was weeks before I felt substantial enough even for that . Tony and I had rooms side by side at Mrs. Gunther 's and shared the bathroom with one other boarder , a retiredschoolteacher named Metzger , who spent most of his time in his room watching television . Metzger lived in fear of having a heart attack and made arrangements with Tony and me that if ever he was stricken , he would summon our help by pounding three times on the wall . He tried it on several occasions in the middle of the night just to see if we were on our toes , and it was after one of these false alarms that Tony and I found it possible to talk for about three minutes about something more than what was new at Sutton High . In T-shirt and undershorts , he sat smoking a cigarette on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christ , Tono , I feel awful about you and Shar . If I thought it was my fault , I 'd shoot myself , " and I said , " Save your ammunition . " He said , " Are you ever going to get back together again ? I mean like this way it 's not either one thing or another . It 's a real nothing situation . " I said , " I wish you 'd tell me , " and I remember thinkingmaybe he could  --  my own flesh and blood telling me about my own flesh , my own blood ; this boy whom myp71sister had named after me and who , having lived with us since the beginning , not to mention having bedded my wife , was the world 's greatest living authority on our marriage , impressed upon it like a seal and with its seal impressedupon him . If anybody could enlighten me , I thought maybe he could . He said , " It must take real guts . " " Being married , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . Only being here like this too , living in this dump all by yourself after all those years of having her to live with . It must take guts . I could n't do it myself , I mean having had it all once and then not having it any more . " " Having somebody to live with and having nobody to live with . You 're right , " I said , wanting him to be right , wanting somebody to be right . " I suppose it takes guts both ways . " " Having somebody to live with , " he said . " And having somebody to sack out with , " and I remember the little jolt of almost schoolteacherly satisfaction I felt , as if he was in my English class and had spotted something in a book that I had n't spotted myself : the guts it took literally to sack out , sleep , by yourself , to let yourself drift alone into dreams , pass unaccompanied into the night where Mark Twain said no man is ever entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , sitting there with his cigarette in one hand and his bare foot in the other , and my schoolteacherly satisfaction vanished as I suddenly saw that all he had meant was that it must take guts to have nobody to have sex with , which was the least of my worries as of course it was among the worst of his . I could hear old Metzger flushing the can acrossp72the hall while before my eyes my wise friend and counselorturned into a child dressed up to look like a man with hair on his chest and the muscles working in his stubbly jaw as he avoided my glance by looking down at the bare floor . " You should try cold showers , " I said . I had never felt more alone . I was a middle-aged man surrounded by children and death . Death was there not only in the form of Metzger ready to thump three times on the wall any minute  --  maybe his flushing was a signal for all I knew  --  but death was downstairs too , laid out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house every morning , death spread out on the tops of every table and shelf in sight . Our landlady , Mrs. Gunther , was the widow of an undertaker who , following the custom of his trade , had over the years accepted payment in kind for his services so that Mrs. Gunther had gone into the antique business with a house full of the lockets and brooches , the beads and spoons and assorted fripperies of the bereaved . Children also surrounded me  --  not just Tony , whom I saw every day , and Bill , whom I saw more clearly for not actually seeing him at all , but the children I taught whatever it is you try to teach in English  --  why Brutus joined the conspirators , the difference between a mixed metaphor and a dangling participle , how to use the language of Shakespeare and Milton more like a precisiontool than a blunt instrument . But such matters as these can be dealt with for only so long at a time , and then there you are with maybe half your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're good at it , you hold your tongue and wait to see what the class will fill it up with themselves . You let a silence endurep73until one of them ca n't stand it any more and says something out of the depths of his discomfort and then another says something else if you 're lucky , and before you know it who can tell what queer and instructive thing may happen . But I have never been good at silences myself . In the classroom I am always the uneasy host to whom the absence of chatter spells disaster , and there is no end to the disastrous things I have said just to keep the party going , things that later I could have bitten my tongue for saying . Not long after the fateful Thanksgiving at Revonoc , for instance , I remember going on at excessive length to a group of ninth graders about what irony meant . I think most of them understood it well enough before I started , but just to keep the silence at bay I rattled on about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said that an ironic statement was a statement where you said one thing but to people who had their ears open said another . I explained that when Mark Antony in his funeral oration called the Romans who had murdered Caesar honorable men , he was being ironic because his inner meaning was that they were a bunch of hoods , and when that remark did n't seem to get anything started , I waded in deeper still . I said that in addition to ironic statements you also had ironic situations . Their silence deepened . I remember then a small , fat boy named Stephen Kulak . He was young for the ninth grade and looked it with a round , pink face and the judicious gaze of a child . He said he saw how something you said could mean two things but he did n't see how something that happened could , so I reached down into my own silence and pulled out the first example that came to hand . I said suppose you had a bride on herp74wedding day . Suppose she was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on her way back from church a car ran into her and she was killed . That was an ironic situation , I said . It was ironic because on the same day that she started out on a new life , her life stopped . Two things . Now did he see what ironic meant ? I rememberwatching him as he sat there at his desk in a Red Baron sweat-shirt trying to puzzle through my lugubrious illustration until finally in some dim and memorable way his pink face seemed to change and he said , " I get it now . It 's a kind of joke , " and I could see that he really had gotten it , that there in a classroom with the Pledge of Allegiance framed on the wall and Christmas wreaths made of red and green construction paper Scotch taped to the window panes , Stephen Kulak had learned from kindly old Mr. Parr , who had a hard time keeping his mouth shut , what irony was , and jokes , and life itself if you made the mistake of keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing out of the way , I suppose what you teach children in an English class is , God help you , yourself . Death ready to thump on the wall or flush the can whenever you least expected it , and Mrs. Gunther , that blondine pelican whose cry was " You do n't find them like that much any more , " meaning the mortuary napkin rings , lapel watches , christening mugs and souvenir spoons from Grand Rapids , Niagara Falls , the Chicago World 's Fair , that she sold in the front parlor directly under the room of that lonesome , horny child who was my nephew . Death leaping out of my own mouth like the frog in the haiku , PLOP into that primeval pond of dozing innocence that was Stephen Kulak . You never knew when death would come at you or from where.  |p75The  children at least you could usually see coming . But not always . I did not see Laura Fleischman coming , for instance , and I suppose there was a certain rightness about it . You do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forwarded me a printed notice from the dentist that it was time I showed up for my annual prophylaxis , and I went for the appointment resigned to yet another meeting with Darius Bildabian , whose chairside manner is perhaps best represented by the way he would wait till you had your mouth full of spit-drainers and cotton waddingand then as you were mumbling with pain under the repeated blasts of cold air that he shot into the living heart of your cavity would say to whoever his nurse happened to be at the moment , " What do you suppose Antonio is trying to tell us , Miss X ? Maybe it 's somethingfunny that happened in school today , " his own exorbitant teeth flashing above you terrible as an army with banners . Waiting in his outer office that December afternoon , I was deep in an article on diseases of the mouth which included the color plate of a tongue covered with matted , black hair when I was summoned into one of the treatment rooms to discover that the hygienist who was to do the preliminaries was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to see coming but whom there would probably have been no way to preparefor even if I had . She had graduated from Sutton High the same year as Tony , and I had had her as a student in senior English . She was a shy , dark-haired girl with high cheekbones andp76something fragile about her smile , like a nun on holiday . The year that she was my student , we had met by accident once in a bar at Grand Central , and in my mind at least , certain things had become possible that day  --  certain doors had half opened which , I suppose because we had not passed through them , had never fully closed so that in a way some shadow of me had stayed waiting in front of them ever since . Sometimes the things that do not quite happen in your life count for more than the things that do . I had not seen her since the day she graduated , and there she stood now in a white dress and white stockings with her hair caught back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anoint the corners of my mouth with a fingertip each of some white lubricant that made me feel like the Tin Woodman when Dorothy oiled his hinges to keep his tears from rusting them , and such conversationas we had took place for the most part with her hands in my mouth  --  the little whirring wheels of rubber and emery , the gritty pink dentifrice , the squirts of tepid Lavoris . She had seen my name in the appointment book so she was ready for our meeting as I was not . Was King Lear still my favorite play ? Did I ever see so-and-so or soand-sofrom her class ? What did I think were Sutton 's chances in track that spring ? How were Mrs. Parr and the baby ? She had come with questions enough to see her through the whole session whereas I was emptyhandedof course and with my mouth jacked open and my eyes fixed glassily on Darius Bildabian 's dental school diploma hanging on the wall considered telling her the truth about Sharon and me but decided not to , said just that Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a baby . None of us was . The one questionp77I could think to ask her in return was about Carl West , the boy she had been going steady with when I 'd last known her , a handsome , laconic basketball player who according to Tony was making out with her in those days any time he felt like it , which I could only imagine was often . " Oh , I have n't seen him for ages , " she said , " not since we broke things off my senior year . " She had turned to get something out of a drawer when my question stopped her . The silver barette held her hair away from her head in back , and as she stood gazing down into the drawer for whatever she would start looking for again when she remembered what it was , the nape of her neck looked bare and vulnerable . She said , " I wrote you a letter about it . You were in England , and I wrote you things were over between Carl West and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I remember , " not remembering . I wondered if I had ever answered the letter . Out of the drawer she took a long-handled dentist 's mirror that caught the light like a star in her hands as she turned back to me . " Carl always said I had a schoolgirlcrush on you , " she said . With pick and mirror she poked her away around my lower jaw while I watched her face for signs of what she was finding . At twenty-two she could have been my daughter , I thought , could have made me in my forties a grandfather by now as for all I knew maybe she already had although she wore no ring . I wondered if Tony had been right about her and Carl West . She frowned as though she was reading my teeth like a palm , my characteras well as my cavities lying open before her , my future as well as my past . I dreaded the moment whenp78she would remove her mirror long enough to tell me that she had seen the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft spot near the gum line of my marriage . I could see the pulse at the base of her throat , the open white collar and shoulder straps of her white slip as she leaned over me . " Rinse , " she said , handing me a pleated paper cup of warm water which I tried to spit out with the urbanity of a wine-taster . " Did you ? " I said as she came at me again , and it stopped her mirror in mid-air . " I 'm sorry ? " she said as though I had caught her attention wandering in senior English . " Have a crush , " I said . " All the girls did , " she said . " Open , please , " hurrying back from the spree of her smile to telling my teeth again like beads . She made a pencil mark on the chart of my lower jaw . " Everybody thought you were out of this world , your name being Antonio and everything . You know how girls are at that age . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't treat us like a bunch of dumb kids like most of them did . Remember the time you spent the class before the prom showing the boys how to tie a bow tie ? We thought  --  " Sharp as a needle , her pick had found something to reckon with in one of my back molars . It kept getting stuck in it as though the molar was made of wax . The edge of her hand was cool against my lip . She said , " Naturally we knew we did n't have a chance , I mean the girls . We used to see your wife when she came out to watch track practice . Everybody said she looked like a Hollywood star . Carl West said  --  " Some fragment of the molar suddenlychipped off and the pick hit pay dirt with a squill of hot pain that I could feel down to the soles of my feet.  | " You 'll need Novocaine for that one , " she said as she marked it down on her chart . I said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again because every pain is a kind of rehearsal , I suppose , for the final pain , the loss of each snag of tooth , each inch of hairline , a foretaste of loss itself as John Donne knew , that grim wag with his puns on dying : dying as death , dying as orgasm , because every time you fire forth the stuff and substance of life , your life itself is somehow less , somehow lost a little . Death , sex , a child named Laura Fleischman , all staring me down together as I reclinedthere with a rubber bib under my chin and Darius Bildabian 's fluorescent klieg bright in my eyes . CASTLE , it said on the light  --  the seige perilous . " Mrs. Parr and I , " I said . " Maybe you 've heard . We 're not together right now . " " Golly , Mr. Parr . I did n't know , " Laura Fleischman said . Golly . . . gee whiz . . . " I 'm awfully sorry . " I 'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me through chattering teeth that he and Sharon were lovers , burying his face in my shoulder , his salt-stiff hair , and saying it over and over again . When a child says I 'm sorry , the sorrow becomes yours to hear the child have to say it . It was Stephen Kulak all over again  --  the sorrow mine for having exposed inner meaning to a child for whom outer meaning was puzzle enough . Irony is a game primarily for grownups . A form of solitaire . Laura Fleischman waited beside me in first communion white as I looked for some way to make light , to make white , of the whole thing . I said , " You know it may be for the best . You fall in love and get married and have kids  --  all of it in such a blind rush the way things go . Maybe somewhere along the line there 's got to be a pulling apart so you can pull back together someday with your eyes open.  |p80I  have n't given up by a long shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , " Laura Fleischman said . I said , " Separation is always illegal as hell . " She was looking down at the lilypad tray where her instruments lay and the chart where she 'd marked down the worst . She said , " They say it 's always darkest just before the dawn . " I said , " There are always lots of good things like that left to say . " " The worst returns to laughter , ' " she said . " When Carl and I split up , I wrote you that was my favorite line in King Lear because it was so hopeful . I never dreamed I 'd be using it someday to cheer you up . " I said , " You 've cheered me up already . " Once in my life I had held Laura Fleischman 's hand . It was the time we had happened to meet in the bar at Grand Central , and with a couple of martinis under my belt I had done it then almost by accident , before I knew what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew what I was doing what seemed centuries before I got around to doing it . My hand was still holding the arm of the chair it had grabbed onto when the pick struck home , and her hand was near enough mine for me to feel the little warmth of air between them . In distant cities mothers unaccountably gathered their children to their skirts and stray dogs showed their teeth as I reached out and took her hand in mine . I said , " You 've given me back my Pepsodent smile . " The irony of the thing as I look back on it , the outernessand innerness of what took place there in Bildabian'soffice . What was outer was the hands themselves , was the diploma on the wall and the jet ofp81water circling in the basin at my elbow , was those white stockings and trig white nurse 's dress she wore , with her dark hair gathered back at her neck , and my grey flannel legs stretched out at full length , my scuffed cordovans toed out on the footrest . What was inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to solve  --  in the comic-strip balloon of my forty-three year old fancy I saw her of course not in white but in nothing , the slimnessof her fragrant and shy as John Skelton 's midsummerflower , gentle as falcon or hawk of the tower . What was inner was mostly the sense of history , her history and mine , the history we were making . The irony of the present is that it has a future . The irony of a hand is all it stands both to hold and to lose . " Poor fool and knave , " I said , like Bebb quoting Scripture , " I have one part in my heart that 's sorry yet for thee . " Darius Bildabian said , " Long time no see , young fella . What 's the bad news ? " He pushed through the curtaineddoor with a round mirror strapped to his foreheadlike a miner , the sound of his voice cleaving our hands like a pick . He took the chart from Laura Fleischman , studied it , humming , and then pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the middle and see into the open secret of my mouth . Later , when the drilling started on my back molar and I lay there making strangled noises at the sheer metaphysics of the thing , he said , " Maybe it 's the one about the traveling salesman , Miss Fleischman . Maybe it 's one Antonio picked up in the locker room at Sutton High , " and when I stood up eventually to leave  --  he had his arm around my shoulder and part of my face was dead and cold  --  Laura Fleischman said , " I 'm still living with myp82mother in the same old house , so if you ever feel like a home-cooked meal , you just let us know , " which meant among other things that before I left the office , I had to explain everything to Darius Bildabian , or almost everything . My face was just starting to come back into its own when later that same day of death and children I drove over to Sharon 's to pick up my son Bill and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . It was to be our first meeting since my departure some three weeks before , and I had arranged it with Sharon over the telephone . It was also the first time I was to see her , or so I assumed until I rang the doorbell  --  how did the stray dogs of the world respond as I stood there on my own doorstep wondering whether to ring or just walk in ?  --  and it was answered not by Sharon but by Anita Steen . It was like taking a drink of ice-water only to discover it is n't ice-water but Gordon 's gin . Or vice versa . Anita Steen looked like a kind of child herself in a way , a short , wrinkled child in velvet slacks and a frilled shirt , a child grown old before its time trying to get somebody to adopt it . She said Sharon had had to stay late at the shop and Bill was still upstairs finishing his bath . She asked me to come in and sit down while I waited . She offered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her elbows on her velvet knees and talked to me through the smoke of her king-size Winston . She said , " Big boy , I 'm going to give it to you straight . I do n't like what 's going on one bit . This kid you 're married to is going through hell . She 'd shoot me if shep83knew I was saying that , but I 'm saying it . When you brought her up here from Squatville , Florida , did you ever stop to think what you were letting her in for ? Did you ever stop to think who you were bringing up here , for God 's sake ? Maybe she 's picked up how to look like Westchester County , but she 's straight corn pone just the same . She does n't say manure , she says horseshit . She does n't read The New Yorker , she reads True Confessions . If her tail itches , she scratches it , and she would n't call it her tail either . I do n't mean she does n't try like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  speed reading lessons and yogi lessons and studying Adele Davis as if it was the holy damn Bible ? Why do you think she came to me for guitar ? The point is it does n't work . She 's a fish out of water . You name me three friends she 's made up here on her own . I do n't mean people you know together . I mean people she knows all by herself . She 's made one friend , and you want to know what her name is ? Her name is Anita Steen , and that 's not exactly what you 'd call hitting the jackpot . " She said , " Listen , it 's time you learned something about loneliness from an expert . If I was the bad fairy at the christening , you know what I 'd leave by the cradle all wrapped up in pink ribbon ? I 'd leave loneliness , that 's what I 'd leave  --  the straight , hundred proof , bonded stuff . I 'm going to tell you something . That bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left here when you pulled out . I happen to know you left three fifths of Jack Daniels when you pulled out , and that 's not one of them because the last of the Mohicans was carried out of here feet first days ago . Somebody told me this morning just breathing the air in the Sharanita Shop was enough to give you a buzz . Maybe she 's not off the deep end yet ,  |p84but  she 's climbing up to the high board . And I 'm going to tell you another thing before Buster Brown gets down here . I 'm going to tell you the time your pants get hottest is the time you 've got time on your hands . All right , so you knew that anyhow , and so I would n't be laying it on you this way if I was cold sober myself , but you can thank your lucky stars Anita Steen 's not cold sober . Take it from me . Time on your hands is time that burns hot as the hinges , and you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty and sour as hell . " She said , " I 'm going to tell you one more thing , and then I 'll shut up . You better make mucho big effort to patch things up between you two or it 's going to be too late . For Christ sake , come down off your high horse , Antonio Parr , because pardon my French , but do n't you believe you 're the only thing in pants that 's rung this doorbell since you left , and I 'm not referring to Anita Steen either . " Whereupon , as if on cue , my five year old son arrived . He was wearing corduroy overalls the color of tomato soup and an Irish sweater put on backwards so that it crowded him under the chin . His feet were bare and lobsterish from the bath , and he was carrying his sneakers in his hands . He said , " Guess what , I made a pee in the tub and nobody even knew a thing . "  |p85DURING  THE WEEK , I lived in Sutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I corrected papers , slept and ate my solitary breakfasts of tap-water instant coffee and dry cereal wet down with milk kept cold on the windowsill , lived in my classroom at school , lived in the diner down by the station where I had supper sometimes with Tony or Metzger but usually alone . Tony went his own way , and I leaned over backwards not to pry because the same footlooseness which was purgatory for me was a kind of potential paradise for him , the first time in his life he had been on his own , and I did n't want him to think he had to carry his uncle on his back . Most of the time I did n't know much about whom he saw or where hep86went , knew only that he kept late hours . Once in a while I would happen on him talking over the phone under the stairs when I came in . At my approach his slow murmur always turned clipped and informational , and no matterhow many steps at a time I tried to make it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I got there . Metzger had no such involvements as far as I knew , but supper time , he explained to me , was prime time with Perry Mason leading on to Walter Cronkite leading on to Truth or Consequences and thence to the crescendo of Dean Martin or Laugh In so most of my suppers I ate by myself . I spent the weekends at Revonoc . There were faster ways of making the trip there , but I always took the way I had known as a child  --  the old Merritt Parkway , the Henry Hudson , the West Side Highway , and then on under the river through the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey . I loved the view you got of the George WashingtonBridge at dusk when it came alive with the tiny lights of cars , that great fragile web thrown across to the Palisades in a way that always made me think of Walt Whitman 's noiseless , patient spider launching forth filament , filament , filament out of himself in the hope that it would catch somewhere , 0 my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hulls and silent stacks of the liners moored at the piers along the West Side Highway and then rolling like a Tinkertoy down the ramp into the tunnel . When I was a small boy , my father told me once that we were traveling under the river and if I kept my eyes open I might see fish swimming by , and that mild whimsy has so stuck in my mind all these years that every trip I 've ever made through that tunnel since has given him back to me again for a moment or two , my poor young father who died before I got around top87knowing who he was . Whenever at night I dream about tunnels , I 'm sure it has nothing to do with what Freud would say but that it 's my father I 'm dreaming about , and I suppose Freud would have something to say about that too . You ca n't be too careful what you tell a child because you never know what he 'll take hold of and spend the rest of his life remembering you by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Bebb , needed to have someone I could talk to about Sharon  --  especially after Anita Steen 's broadside  --  and about the life I was leading without her , to use the word life loosely , and about the life she was leading without me or that was leading her . It was n't that I needed Bebb to give me advice so much as I needed him simply to give me his attention  --  to reassure me , simply by listening to my story , that it was n't just a story , was n't just something I had dreamed up , but something that was actually happening to me , something that had had a beginning and was having a middle and that someday , I hoped , would have like everything else an end . The irony of the thing , as I might have explained it to Stephen Kulak , was that Bebb hardly noticed my need . My need and his not noticing . Two things . It was Gertrude Conover who explained Bebb to me . Bebb himself was off somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . She was stretched out on a chaise longue with her feet up and a Siamese cat named Fred in her lap . She said , " Leo is round . He has always been round . The things that man has done with his life  --  all his lives  --  and the things his life has done to him , they have made him round as a ball . They have made him the shape of a boulder , the shape of an apple . " What I wanted to say to her was that Sharon wasp88hitting the Jack Daniels , that Anita Steen and I were n't the only things in pants that had rung her bell since I 'd moved out , that all through my supper with Bill I had had to sit on my hands to keep from pumping him about her , listening instead as he sat there over his congealing hot roast beef sandwich looking at me through his mother 's eyes , more green than brown , and chattering on about what he wanted for Christmas as if it was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living under the same roof any more . But Gertrude Conover either did n't notice what I wanted to say any more than Bebb did or else she was approaching it , as she walked , sideways . She said , " You know those toys they have for children , those boxes with the lids cut out in diamond shapes , star shapes , cross shapes and so on so that the child has to pick out the right shape block to get it into the box through the right shape hole ? That is the law of karma in a nutshell . The shape you make of your life this time round has everything in the world to do with the shape of your life the next time round . If it is an angry , jagged shape , the only life it will fit into next time will be an angry , jagged life  --  a wolf , perhaps , or somebody like that awful New Hampshire journalist who made poor Muskie cry . " I said , " Bip is a ball ? " She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it for yourself , Antonio . You do n't have to be a theosophist . He is tight and solid and round . He rolls like a ball . He bounces like a ball . He is hard to get hold of like a ball because a ball has no corners or edges to get hold of it by . In all his lives his karma attracts him to round , balllikepeople like round Nancy Oglethorpe . Everything she 's got is round . And to round places . You were withp89him at Stonehenge . Why do you think he was so much in his element at Stonehenge ? You saw the way he looked there  --  as if he 'd come home . My dear , Stonehengeis a circle . And now Alexander Hall . Do n't think it 's an accident that Leo Bebb found his way to AlexanderHall . Besides there are no accidents . That 's karma for you . In a nutshell . " Alexander Hall , that roundest and most Bebbsian of all University buildings , that great mound of roughhewnpink brownstone with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their conical roofs , the bulging sides of its circular , glassed-in arcade that you have to pass through to enter the rotundity it encircles , that omphalos of varnished oak and Homeric mosaic where public lectures , concerts , Roman Catholic masses , and other such miscellaneous University activities take place . Alexander Hall was where , by accident or otherwise , Bebb and Nancy Oglethorpe came to preside over their Love Feasts for a while . Gertrude Conover helped arrangeit through her Nassau Hall connections , thus makingherself the agent of karmic potencies . The article in The Daily Princetonian was what started the ball rolling , to use an expression that GertrudeConover would have said was no accident . It hit the front page , and there were pictures . Bebb standing beneath the stone lions of Revonoc . Waiters , musicians , guests hurrying down the front steps on their way to invite in the uninvited . Nancy Oglethorpe making her apologia under the chandelier . The reporter played his story straight for the sake of laughs , but there were no laughs of the kind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bebb was taken up like Tiffany glass or Art Nouveau , not as something to laugh at but as ap90base from which to laugh instead at the kind of people who would find him laughable . If Bebb had appeared in beard and beads playing Jesus rock on an electric guitar , the chances are Princeton would n't have given him the time of day , but he came in his gents ' furnishings suit and Happy Hooligan hat talking about the blood of the Lamb as if it was delivered to his door by the quart every morning , and Princeton lapped it up with an enthusiasm that I think caught even Bebb by surprise . Bebb gave much of the credit to Nancy Oglethorpe . He said , " Antonio , that woman is a powerhouse . I do n't care spit how she used to tom-cat around out there at the grad school , she come clean about all that the first feast we ever had . Though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be white as snow , Antonio , that 's how clean she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ever since . Why she 's better than Brownie ever knew how to be , and she 's no kind of pussyfoot like Brownie is either . The trouble with Brownie is that life throwed such a scare into him from the word go , he never lived it , just stuffed it inside his drawers and sat on it . That Nancy Oglethorpe , she 's lived . She knows what she 's talking about when she talks . And she knows what I 'm talking about too . " Knew what Bebb was talking about and with her organizational skills and convert 's zeal saw to it that what he was talking about was given maximum coverage and distribution by peeling those original Thanksgiving banqueters , whose names and addresses she managed to get down in shorthand before they left , to a hard core which she deployed through the town and campus like Vigilantes armed with flyers announcing each subsequentLove Feast as it came along and suggesting the menu . Put your hand in the hand of the man who fedp91five thousand . Eat your troubles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thirsteth , come ! And they came , more and more as the weeks went by until finally Revonoc was n't big enough to hold them , thirsting for God ( if anybody ) knew what and fulfilling the dream Bebb had gone to sleep on all those years of gypsying around the world with Gertrude Conover and fulfilling too , I suppose , some round , Babylonian dream of Nancy Oglethorpe 's . She too came into her own in that round of feasting , found herself for the first time not dictated to but dictating , not typing but typed at last as some kind of camp Magdalen forgiven much because she loved much , loved among other things being all dressed up in beehive and fruit salad with somewhere to go for once where she was n't the one who got paid but who paid for a change and , as Bebb was her partner , paid out in good measure , pressed down and shaken together and running over . Bebb was the master of the feasts and Nancy Oglethorpethe caterer who saw to it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including herself . Who came ? In an interview in the Prince Nancy Oglethorpe was quoted as saying , " Being as how I took psychology at Hunter College and it has been a life-long interest of mine ever since that time , I am more psychologicallyoriented than Bible oriented vis-a-vis the socalledLove Feast movement here in town , and though we end up meaning the same thing I would use a different type language than Leo Bebb to describe what 's going on . Mr. Bebb says the individuals we are relating to are lost sheep , and I say more they are like myself lonely and insecure persons with the kind of self-destruct hang-ups you got to expect anywhere this day and agep92but especially in a cultural scene like Princeton which attracts a basically introverted and egg-head type of individual . Who comes ? You name it , at Love Feasts we got it . " What did they find when they got there ? The detractorsof the movement  --  because of course detractors were inevitable and when they came , they came not without ammunition  --  the sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Feast you could find whatever you were looking for , meaning the worst , needless to say : winos finding winos , acid-heads acidheads , fairies fairies , victims victimizers , and so on , everybody confessing his sins and then cozying up afterwardsto the ones who had a taste for the same kind of sinning he did . The supporters of the movement no less than the detractors agreed that the genius of the Love Feasts was that much of what you always found there was each other , was other people exposing themselves as you yourself were exposed . Whether the exposure was decent or indecent was left to the eye of the beholder to decide , was left finally to the eye of God himself just as I suppose it was left to the eye of God to decide about the whys and wherefores of Bebb 's exposing whatever it was he had been charged with exposing all those long years before out in back of a seafood restaurant in Miami Beach to a bunch of children playing niggerbaby with a tennis ball . Was he coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those kids he was laying himself bare or to himself or to Jesus or to all three at once ? I doubt if Bebb himself knew though I never came right out and asked him . I doubt if anybody but God knew about Bebb or the Love Feasts either . Anyway , what they found at those Love Feasts wasp93each other and food . Drink . The original turkey and claret punch gave way to simpler fare . While Revonoc was still the scene of operations , they experimented with various possibilities . They tried Kool Aid , milk , and a combination of ginger ale and Welch 's grapejuice . They tried Slim Jims , Sultanas , Fritos . It was Bebb the teetotalerwho said he did n't care much what there was to eat but thought what there was to drink should have some kick to it . He said it over Nancy Oglethorpe 's objection that if word got around alcohol was being used , it might attract the wrong kind of people , to which Bebb said , " Sister Nancy , it 's the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing about Jesus . And he wants the right kind of people too . I was raised a Baptist , and a Baptist takes to spirits like Satan takes to holy water , but I ca n't help that . It 's spirits helps oil the hinges between the wrong people and the right people , and it 's spirits Jesus served the night they come to take him , not soda pop , though there 's Baptists would tell you different . " So what they ended up with was a kind of punch that was partly for Jesus ' sake and partly too , I think , for Lucille 's sake because like the Tropicanas that Lucille had drowned her sorrows in and finally herself , there was a lot of orange juice in it , only then , in place of the gin and in far less majestic proportions , a dry , white wine . It even tasted like Tropicanas if you did n't think too hard about it . " Here 's to Jesus , " Bebb would say , raising his paper cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropicanas in hand , everybody would turn to his neighbor and say , " Here 's to you . " That was the way the Love Feasts opened . They closed , as on Thanksgiving , with the kiss of peace . And what went on between ? The big difference be/tween the movies of my childhood and the movies of today is that the old ones seemed to have so many more people in them . It was n't just Cecil B. DeMille with his casts of thousands either . Marie Antoinette with Norma Shearer and Tyrone Power , Captains Courageous , the Marx brothers , Ninotchka , in the big-scale ones and the small-scale ones both there were not only all the people you could see on the screen but I always had the feeling that off-screen too  --  behind every closed door and around the bend of every corridor and outside on the street  --  there were always at least as many people again all in full costume just waiting around in case a door happened to blow open or the director decided to aim his camera in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , or maybe it just seemed there were more people in the old movies because in my own world then there were so comparatively few  --  just Miriam and me and whatever nurse happened to be looking after us at the time  --  but in any case they always gave me a sense of there being inexhaustibly more than enough of everything to go round including people . In movies then , as in my life then , I had the sense that the fun of it was never going to run out . And so with the Love Feasts . In between the toast to Jesus at the beginningand all the kissing and squeezing at the end , there were not only all the people who were actually present but all the people who might be corralled in off the streets  --  because at each Love Feast Bebb sent out a deputation for that purpose  --  and all the people also that the ones who were corralled in might in turn corral in themselves , and so on , world without end . Whatever you found at Bebb 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than you had bargained for . And you could be sure , of course , that there would bep95Bebb himself , that round man , that snowball gathering substance somehow as he gathered momentum , growing rounder and fuller as the weeks went by until you felt that the time would come when his tight skin , his tight face and raincoat , must surely split . No wonder he failed to notice the obscure needs I brought with me from Sutton . Once in a while , he tried . If I mentioned Sharon 's name , he would sometimes glance my way over his shoulder as a miler might at the shout of a familiar voice from the bleachers  --  " You got to keep the wires open between you and her , Antonio , and between you and Jesus , " profundities like that  --  but then on back to the relentless dash and downhill barrelling again . He had his hands full , more than his hands . The Love Feasts were feasts , which meant anybody could propose a toast , propose anything . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man named Roebuck , with a handlebar moustache and combat boots . He came regularly . When he spoke , you could see his teeth through his moustache . There was something antiphonal about the propositions and counterpropositions that he and Bebb exchanged . " Every place I look I do n't see Jesus , " I remember Roebuck 's saying once . " Where is he ? " " Wherever two or three are gathered together in his name , that 's where he is , " Bebb said . " Ca n't see him , " Roebuck said . " He sees you , " Bebb said . " We have this twelve year old , this sick one . His hands do n't work , " Roebuck said . " He wears a little helmet with a piece sticking out from the forehead with a Magic Marker attached to it . That 's how he writes his name . " " Jesus said suffer the little children to come unto mep96and hinder them not , " Bebb said . " You bring him on in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " Roebuck said . Bebb said , " Lord , I believe , help thou mine unbelief . " Roebuck said , " You will give him the use of his hands and fingers . You will make it so he can walk like a human being instead of a bundle of broken sticks . " Bebb said , " There 's nobody knows the grief in your heart save only one . It 's like your grief is his grief . " Roebuck said , " Since Thomas Aquinas , the fattest of all the saints , there have been five classic proofs advancedfor the existence of God . There 's the ontological proof , the teleological proof , the proof from consensus , and so forth . Do you have a favorite ? " Bebb said , " I never got past grade school . I was n't much bigger than your boy when I took my first job so I could n't prove the six-times table . Jesus , he believed God existed . That 's the best proof I got . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " Roebuck said , " or Jesus either . " " Where 's that you have n't looked for him ? " Bebb said . Roebuck stood there in Alexander Hall with the bottoms of his trousers bloused out over his combat boots . " Up my bleeding ass , " he said . Or Bebb on power : " The American Free Enterprise system could n't never so much as been if it was n't for Jesus . The Christmas trade alone is a for instance . Right here in Princeton , New Jersey , more gifts are being bought and wrapped up this very minute in the name of Jesus than in any other name in the Yellow Pages or the whole telephone directory . That 's power for you . " Or Bebb on confession : " It 's not like Jesus doesn'tp97know all the things you ever done that are wrong without you telling him about them . But until you lay your cards on the table and level with him , they 're the great gulf fixed between you . It 's only when you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Gate Bridge . " Or Bebb on travel : " All the roads in the world are one road when you come right down to it because your dirt tracks , your superhighways , your Park Avenues , the place they all end up at is the same place , and that 's the funeral parlor . We all got that to look forward to before we 're through , and we all got rough places and smooth places both till we get there , so in the meantime let 's stick close to each other while we follow the road to Jesus . This cup I 'm hoisting now , it 's one for the road . " Bebb with his cup raised to eye level , his viaticum  --  he only wet his lips with it . Bebb with his spooked eyelid making its secret signal . As once among lions , Bebb among the gleanings of Holder Hall , Cottage Club , Ivy , the ghettoes of John Street , Quarry Street , Witherspoon , the faculty room in Nassau Hall where once the ContinentalCongress sat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I came to see Bebb , driving south to see him from Sutton on out past the Palisades loop-the-loop across the twilit Hudson , beneath the prows of the great ships and down through the tunnel that was the tunnel to my father and to the mystery of myself . Or was Roebuckright that the only mystery was that there was no mystery ? I carried with me to Bebb all the needs his Love Feasts did n't leave him time enough or heart enough to notice , what with all of Princeton to save . Unless the truth of it was that he did notice them and aimed his cornpone homilies at them  --  carried Sharon in his belly as I carried her in mine , the vision of her hittingp98the Jack Daniels with Anita Steen standing by to count the dead soldiers as they were carried out feet first , my son Bill trying to get it through to her that for Christmas it was a long-handled machine you could find buried treasure with that he wanted most , as which of us does n't , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Love Feasts , at least there was nothing less . And there was also , of course , Nancy Oglethorpe . Like Superman , her true identity remained hidden from the majority of mankind . She went right on with her career as itinerant stenographer , and nobody would have looked twice to see her misfiring up the hill to the grad school in her black Chevvy with her electric typewriteron the back seat , her Corrasable Bond and sharp yellow pencils . Even if somebody had looked twice , the most he might have seen on the second go was a Nancy Oglethorpe who no longer offered the variety of services she had of old but who entered those ravaged scholars ' rooms armed now with the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation to fend off temptation . Like unassuming Clark Kent , who only when he stripped down to his acrobat 's tights and waist-length cape revealedthe superstrength that enabled him to fly through the air like a bird and batter down steel walls with his bare fist , it was only at the Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . She presided over the distribution of the Tropicanas . She organized the rescue squad that followed Scriptural precedent by combing the streets for the uncombed . She handled press releases to the Daily Princetonian and , as word spread , to the Trenton Times and Newark Evening News . She did the mimeographing and sent out the notices and when the practice started of collecting lovep99offerings at each feast , managed the banking and bookkeepingof that too . But her real power was as Bebb 's eminence grise , the Dale Arden to his Buck Rogers . Bebb was crazy about her from the start . Partly , I suppose , it was because hers was the first heart he gave himself credit for opening since the old Holy Love days and partly because she was the first to suggest that the original Love Feast should be perpetuated . I think too that Bebb was impressed by her beehive , her French heels , her poison green coat and found it all far closer to his idea of haute couture than Gertrude Conover 's muted woolens , far closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pepsi generation . Or maybe Gertrude Conover was right and what attracted Bebb to her most was that like him , like Stonehenge and Alexander Flail , she was round , only round with a roundnessthat , unlike Bebb 's , you could get hold of , a downfilled , yielding roundness . She was also , as she put it , psychologically oriented , that oriental odalisque , and from Hunter College days she brought certain EncounterGroup techniques and ploys which in time Bebb came to adapt to his own ends . She said , " It 's got to be more give and take , Leo , not just you giving and them taking all the time . Nobody can relate to a father figure indefinitely . Eveybody wants a piece of the action , " so there came to be feasts where instead of preaching to them , Bebb would simply stand up on the platform and throw words out to them . The words he threw out were old sawdust trail words like salvation and sin and faith , and his congregation would come back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word at a time , sometimes a whole barrage of words at once.  |p100JESUS  Bebb would wing at them like a big league pitcher , and Christ they would bat back at him , Christ and cross and crutch , cripple and couple and two , one , win , wine , waste . HEAVEN he 'd send sizzling down towardsome plate , then duck to avoid being clobbered by sky , pie , day , night , light , dark , dreaming , Daddy . I heard PEACE get him sleep , get him sack and sex , languor and anger and fight , truce , truth , together , tomorrow and sorrow ; LOVE get him found , food , fool , full , feel , heal , holy and Hell . Sometimes the words sailed up between them like birthday balloons . Sometimes it was more like Francis Scott Key 's bombs bursting in air , the red glare of rockets like armageddon , marmalade , Mama Cass , piece of ass , peace of mind , matter , shatter , shit , shalom , home , sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only proof through the night that the flag was still there would be the star- and sweatspangledface of Bebb himself standing up there on the platform where Eleanor Roosevelt and John Mason Brown had stood before him . Many a time that winter by the twilight 's last gleaming I watched him up there with his face buttoned tight against the storm he had unleashed . And sometimes I watched him up there having failed to unleash anything , calling out old names that he had lived with all his life and getting nothing back at all . Beelzebub , Cherubim , Goshen  --  like astronautson a space walk they would hang suspended in the echoing silence of Alexander Hall . I remember riding back with him one snowy night in Gertrude Conover 's Lincoln on the way to take Nancy Oglethorpe home and hearing him say to her , " Sometimesit 's like Pentecost , Miss Nancy , and sometimes it 's like what you find scratched up on a outhouse wall . "  | " It 's for real , " Nancy Oglethorpe said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes I think it 's no substitute for old-time Gospel preaching . " He was leaning forward over the wheel to peer through the whirling flakes . " It is not telling the good news to the poor . " " Pardon me for living , " Nancy Oglethorpe said through the fur collar of her poison green coat . It was Nancy Oglethorpe also who introduced a new method of confession into the Love Feast liturgy . Originallyconfessions had been made the way Nancy Oglethorpehad made hers at the first Love Feast  --  one person would stand up when he felt like it and say his piece . I remember a seminarian with all his hair shaved off and a loose-fitting grey sweat-shirt saying that he stole on the average of a dozen books a week from the U. Store . I remember a nurse from the hospital telling how the sight of the dying filled her with secret loathing , and a varsity tennis player with a golden beard telling how he had corrupted a twelve year old girl on the shores of Lake Carnegie . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing how in Normandy in 1944 he had for no reason he could explain shot a child out of a tree like a squirrel . After each confession Bebb would come lay his hands on the person 's head and tell them Jesus had forgiven them the way he had forgiven the good thief on the cross who said , " Jesus , remember me , " and Jesus had said , " Today thou shalt be with me in Paradise . " There was n't one of us , Bebb said , that Jesus would n't rememberwhen the chips were down . Then another one of the Feasters would raise his Tropicana and say , " Here 's looking at you , " and the one who had confessed wouldp102raise his , and the two of them would look at each other across their paper cups , and I suppose that meant that even if Jesus was still dragging his feet , at least they could look at each other . It was a step in the right direction . Nancy Oglethorpe said , " I 'm asking you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it like that ? Six or seven maybe ? Ten out of a hundred ? You need guts to come clean in public like that , and if you had that kind of guts , you probably would n't have sinned in the first place . It 's a vicious-type circle . " So again she persuaded Bebb to do it so that everybody could get into the act , and the way she taught him was this . When Bebb gave the word , everybody was supposed to pick out a person to confess to so that there was a lot of milling around and changing places , and for a while it looked like a bargain basement with everybody trying to find the one it would cost him least to spill the beans to  --  townie dropouts and varsity jocks , Aquarian potheads , coed madonnas with ironed hair , **29;732;TOOLONG who put flowers in the barrels of ROTC rifles . When everybody was finally coupled , the Oglethorpian rite was simple . Your partner held his hands up side by side , palms out . You made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mirror and described out loud what was wrong with your face . Then your partner described in turn what was wrong with his face as he looked into the mirror of your hands . When you were both finished , for absolution you fed each other the sacramental elements . If crumbs got into your beard or Tropicanas slopped down over your love-beads , Nancy Oglethorpe said so much the better . It helped break the ice . An ice-type breaker.  |p103The  only time I gave it a try myself was soon after my conversation about Sharon with Anita Steen . It was the first Sunday the moveable feast had moved into AlexanderHall . There was a bigger crowd than at Revonocmaybea hundred and fifty by then  --  but because of the new setting with its lingering aura of people like John Kenneth Galbraith and Edward Weeks up there on the platform , things were a lot more subdued than usual . People did n't do much singing and jostling and hugging before the show got rolling but just sat down in the curved wooden pews with their paper plates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly waited . I was sitting with Gertrude Conover , and when Bebb gave us the word to choose our partners , it was like dancing school at the Plaza when old Miss Bloss would tell us the same thing , and I knew I ought to choose Gertrude Conover because I 'd brought her , but I did n't want to . I did n't feel like telling her what I saw in her hands that was wrong with my face  --  through theosophicalchannels she probably knew it already  --  and maybe even more than that , I did n't feel like having her tell me what she saw that was wrong with her face . In a way she was the closest thing I had just then to a rock to cling to , and I did n't want to find out that she was a secret drinker , say , or was making out with the gardener . In memory of Miss Bloss I was just about to do my duty by her anyway when to my great relief a red-haired woman I recognized as a waitress from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was short-lived , however , because the next thing I knew , I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned to find Nancy Oglethorpe standing in the aisle asking me in effect if she could have the next dance . The way she held her hands , her face was concealedp104behind them so at least I did n't have her eyes upon me as I stood there cringing at the thought of anatomizing myself in her overpowering presence . The trouble was that it was n't my face I saw in her hands , but only her hands themselves , those white , pat-a-cake palms with their fleshy mounts of Venus and her destiny chainstitchedall over them in pink . All around us in that great varnished rotunda the sound of the other Love Feasters shriving each other was like what you hear in a theater when the house lights go up and everybody starts reclaiming for himself a part of the silence . Looking into her hands , I did the best I could . I said , " They say husbands and wives get to look like each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my face is my wife 's face . The hitch is my wife and I have split up so the part of my face that 's got her in it has split up too , cracked like a plate you might say . It wo n't work any more anyway . When I took our little boy out for supper , just the two of us , I could n't make it work worth a damn . My face is turning into a deadpan . It 's turning into a deadpanbecause there 's this part of it that 's dead . Maybe it 's what always happens when you get to be in your forties . Maybe it 's what I even want to have happen . I 'm afraid that 's all I can see in my face right now , Nancy , but it 'll have to do , You 're next . Amen . " I raised my hands quickly then to have them there to hide behind before Nancy Oglethorpe had a chance to lower hers . I just made it . Out of the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lahiere 's waitress going at it . Gertrude Conover had her hands up with one ear pressed to them and a dim , astral smile on her face as though she was listening to familiar footsteps through a wall.  |p105Looking  at herself in the mirror of my sweaty palms , Nancy Oglethorpe was saying . " My name 's Obenzinger . I took Oglethorpe as my professional name , but every time I see my face I know I 'm Obenzinger . My face has got Obenzinger written all over it . Whoever 's going to enter into a permanent one-to-one relationship with a person that 's got a face like mine except another Obenzinger ? I hate my face for being like it is . I hate myself for hating it . " She stopped talking then , and I felt I could n't just stand there behind my hands in silence . I thought of saying I 'd never guessed her secret  --  had taken her for a classmate of Jackie Kennedy 's , a member of Piping Rock , a Daughter of the American Revolution . I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's problems are psychosomatic and other people 's problems are psychosemitic and it was n't anything she ought to feel too bad about . But as things turned out , I was spared having to say anything . Over the tops of her fingertips I could see her beehive bending so near me that if my hands had n't been between us , we would have been eyeball to eyeball . I did n't know what she was up to . Some darker confession that she had to come this close to whisper ? Some **26;763;TOOLONG ploy like suddenly spreading my hands apart by the thumbs and taking my nose between her teeth ? Instead what she did was this . Taking my hands by the wrists , she planted a moist , pneumatic kiss dead in the center of one of them . I can feel it there still . Was it my need she kissed or her own ? I do n't know , but the next moment there we were like a bride and groom feeding each other the first piece of wedding cake . I took a sip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of my Ritz cracker with her tiny teeth and swallowed it , unchewed , like the true host . Maybe the cynics were right , I thought , and all that Bebb 's feasts were was a chance to look the field over . Maybe the Tropicanas and Ritz crackers were only the hors d'oeuvres , and the meat and potatoes came when you met in the sack afterwards . It 's possible that Nancy Oglethorpe was n't absolving me with her kiss at all but only trying to establish at last a permanent one-to-one relationship with somebody who was n't an Obenzinger . But it 's possible too that the lines ca n't be drawn as sharply as that , and as I drove back to Sutton that evening , drove north past the Cloisters and the piers of the great bridge , it occurred to me that one way or the other maybe her kiss was as close to the kiss of peace as any I was likely to find anywhere else just then . Things being what they were.  |p107THE  WEEK after I got back from Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon of the final day of classes helping straighten up the gym after the Christmas book fair . In the overheated world of Sutton High it is always mid-August and under the bright overhead lights of the gym in their wire cages it is always high noon so that during the hours I spent packing the unsold books back into cartons and lending a hand with the trestle tables , I lost all track of what the weather was up to outside . It was only when I stepped out into the parking lot around five that I discovered that about four inches of snow had fallen , and it was still coming down hard.  |p108The  damp linen smell and coarse-woven silence of the snow . The fan-shapes of light from the gym windows and the sight of my car almost unrecognizable as it crouched there lonely and white . To teach school is to catch from the children you teach not only their colds but a little of their childhood too , and I stood there at the gym door with a panic in my stomach no less sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that school was out and vacation had begun , at the unexpectedsight of the snow . In the fullness of time , the Scriptural phrase goes , and for a moment or two it was as if , filled to bursting , time had split apart at last , and there at the heart of it was the mystery laid bare . It was time to go home , or the heart of time was home , and I had been there all along without knowing it just the way all that hot , bright afternoon of dismantling the book fair I had been part of a snowfall without knowing it . Then Ralph Milliken , the Principal , thrust his way out through the door at my back in his clinking galoshes and velour cap with ear-flaps saying , " Plan to be home for Christmas ? " as he pushed on past me , and with my briefcase heavy in one hand and my portable typewriter heavy in the other , I realized that home was Mrs. Gunther 's and vacation was watching Dean Martin ham it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time being anyway , I could n't face either and drove downtowninstead . Most of the stores were open late for Christmas , and the lights were on in the Sharanita Shop . From the other side of the street I could see the shelves laden with vitamins and the revolving stand of paperbacks . There were open barrels of things like brown rice and sunflower seeds , nuts and dried fruit lined up in apothecary jars . Only Sharon , if she was there , I could n't see . With nop109clear intention of going in but just to touch base at the sight of her , I crossed the street and , standing off to one side , looked in through the plate glass at where she usually sat behind the cash register . The chair was empty , but over the back of it was a sweater I recognized . It was a camel 's hair cardigan she had bought at Sevenoaks the day we drove down in Gertrude Conover 's rented Daimler to see Hever Castle because it was where the Boleyns came from and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite . The sweater had pearl buttons down the front and was too long for her , and I remember telling her it made her look like a Nanny . In the ashtray her cigarette was smoking , and over a doorknobhung a canvas bag that must have gone back to Armadillo days . It had The Sunshine State and a palm tree stenciled on it . Even your worst enemy 's belongings , left defenseless and alone that way , can be more eloquentthan the Gettysburg Address , and it was that cardigan that made me open the door and step into the empty shop . The smoldering cigarette was two thirds ash , and I stubbed it out . I studied the paperbacks for a while . There was Drink Your Troubles Away : the Health Cocktail Habit by somebody named John Lust and The Miracle of VitaminC with a reproduction of Michelangelo 's God creatingAdam on the cover . There was The Hidden Menace of Hyperglycemia and Overfed but Undernourished . I had just put back Magnesium , the Nutrient that Could Change Your Life and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a thump and rumbling in the plumbing , and in a moment or two a door into the back of the shop opened , and Sharon came out . She was wearing a wrap-around crazy-quilt skirt over the black leotards she wore to yoga class . If she was surprised top110find me there , she gave no sign of it . Just a moment 's hesitation at the door as she pulled the skirt around at the waist to make it as straight as her face . " Hey , " she said . I said , " Merry Christmas . " We did n't shake hands or anything , just faced each other there over the health foods and life-enriching vitamins , and I knew it was a mistake to have come , maybe even to have been born . I thought of the barbecue at Herman Redpath 's ranch where in a dress the color of moonlight she had come toward me once between a marimba band and a portable outhouse with Bebb whisperingin my ear , " Behold new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to say something , anything , worthy of the occasion , I had asked her to marry me . I wondered if any such thought crossed her mind as she went and took her usual seat behind the cash register so that it was from above I saw her , like a teacher proctoring an exam  --  her cheekbones , the glimmer and dividing of her hair . " I was fixing to give you a call one of these days , " she said , lighting what I took to be one of Anita Steen 's kingsizeWinstons . " Rip 's got me worried half sick . " " Rip 's fine , " I said . " He 's the belle of Princeton . There 's nothing to worry about . " She said , " Did he tell you the new one he 's pulling on the IRS this year ? " I said , " He does n't tell me the time of day any more . He 's too busy with the Pepsi generation . " " You 're lucky , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this time he 's really stuck his neck out . He was so tickled he called me up special just to read it out over the phone . " I said , " Read what out ? "  | " His tax form , " she said . " He 's filled out his tax form this year like he was n't filling it out for himself but he was filling it out for Jesus . Right down the line , that 's how he 's done it . Like where it says put down your first name , he 's put down the first name Jesus , and where it says last name , he 's put down , I am the first and the last , says the Lord . ' " She said , " The place where it says wages , he 's put down The wages of sin is death . ' He 's filled out that whole thing with words out of Scripture like it was Jesus filling it out , Render unto Caesar ' and all that stuff . He says all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why not send it in like it was Jesus 's income . He was pleased as punch when he read it over the phone . " This time they 're going to get him , " she said . " They 're going to jail him sure . The best he can hope for is they 'll pack him off to the funny farm . " " He 's been in worse spots , " I said . She said , " I remember the time they jailed him before , the time they had him up for what they said he pulled on those kids in Miami . I was just a kid myself . I was playing in the yard with a cat name of Mercy that Brownie gave me . I remember Luce come out in a wrapper half stoned and told me . She told me they were fixing to lock my daddy up five years for doing something that had n't hurt a soul and was just his nature , and right then when she told me , I was sick all over that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Luce first started hitting the Tropicanas , the most either of us ever had was each other , Bip and me . Even if he 's from outer space like Luce said , he was always real good to me . I never heard him say a mean or spiteful thing , and he never took a strap to me all those years though there was plenty ofp112times he should of . He took me on trips with him soon as I was big enough to take , and he told me his troubles , some of them , same as I told him mine . He made a fuss over me like he was trying to make it up to me because I was n't his own flesh and blood . Sometimes I used to think I really was his own flesh and blood though he told me different  --  not Luce 's , but his  --  and there 's still times I 'm not sure . There 's lots nobody knows about Bip . It did n't seem like I was ever going to get over them lockinghim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess it was n't the easiest thing in the world , being Bip 's daughter . " She said , " I never thought about it like that . " I said , " Do n't think about it . " I could hear a car trying to get unstuck out in the snow somewhere , the panicky sound of tires spinning . " Your life is n't something to think about too much . You just live it the best way you can . " She said , " When you start thinking about it , you 're sunk . " As she raised her head , some vague fragrance reached me that could have been perfume or Bourbon or something fruity she 'd had for lunch . She said , " It 's like Mickey Mouse , the way he can walk off the edge of a cliff and go walking right on in thin air without thinking a thing about it . Soon as he looks down and starts thinkingabout it , that 's when he starts falling . " " Mickey Mouse always comes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When I come through in the end , I 'll let you know . " She said , " How about you , Bopper ? Is everything OK ? " " I 'm OK , " I said.  |p113She  said , " You go out and have yourself some fun , hear ? There ought n't to be any time you ca n't find some way at least to have some fun in it . " " How about you ? " I said . " Are you having any fun ? " She said , " Not one hell of a lot if you want to know , " and then the bell over the door tinkled , and a black girl came in with snowflakes in her hair . She said she was looking for Mu tea , and while Sharon was hunting around for it , I stood there by the brown rice and sunflower seeds wondering what I had come looking for myself . Somebody to go to bed with again as lovers do and friends do , both  --  a lover to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark be dark with until it covers you up like snow ? Somebody to say no when I said yes and never when I said now , to give a shape and edge to the emptiness of things even if it was a cutting edge ? Maybe all I was looking for was just somebody to grow old along with me like Rabbi Ben Ezra so I would n't end up traveling around the world like Gertrude Conover to make myself believe I had a home to come home to that I was homesick for . I thought about walking out of the gym into another world and about what Bebb put down for Number of Dependents when he was filling out his form 1040 for Jesus . I suppose what Bebb put down was Everybody . For myself I would have to put down Nobody . Several more customers came in while Sharon was making change for the black girl with snowflakes in her hair , so I picked up a brown bottle with a pink label on it and took it up to her to pay for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of Vitamin C , " I said , and I thought of Michelangelo 's God on the paperback cover reachingp114down out of his cloud to touch Adam who is stretching out his hand in such a languid way to receive the gift of life that you wonder if he really wants it . Maybe he had an inkling of all the strings attached . Sharon would n't take my money . She said , " It 's a Christmas present , " then leaned over the cash register and breathed into my ear , " Shove one of these up three times a day and you 'll feel like new . " This time there was no doubt it was Bourbon . I 'm coming home , I thought of saying , thought of leaning forward and burying my face in her sleepsmellinghair as the customers waited their turn . The trouble was my symptoms were the reverse of Charlie Blaine 's . Charlie Blaine complained that after each move he made , he could feel some shadowy presence inside him making the move all over again , a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the shadow that came first , a dim impulse to reach out , to touch , that I had nothing inside me substantial enough to carry out because I had the idea it was my death that was real , my life the echo . In Alexander Hall Nancy Oglethorpe had fed me from her Lily cup and in the Sharanita Shop Sharon had made me a present of Vitamin C , but neither of them was powerful enough to bring the roses to my cheeks . I said , " Maybe it 's magnesium I need , the nutrient that could change your life , " but by that time a man in a ski parka had stacked his purchases on the counter , and Sharon was starting to add them up for him , tapping them one by one with the eraser of her pencil , so I drifted back out into the night again like snow and wandered around town the better part of an hour with a frozen carrot for a nose and two thumbprints where my eyes should have been.  |p115IT  WAS BROWNIE who unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , Bebb 's former assistant and factotum in whose hands Bebb had left the new Church of Holy Love that Herman Redpath had built for him at his ranch outside Houston . When I first met Sharon , she told me that the reason Brownie always smelled so strongly of after-shave was that he drank it , but she admitted she 'd never caught him at it , and I do n't think she really believed the charge herself . Brownie smelled of after-shave because he doused himself with it , that 's all , and he doused himself with it because he was by nature given to always trying to make fragrant and comforting anything that might otherwise smell of mortality . As a biblical exegete , for instance ,  |p116there  was no barbarity of Scripture that he was n't prepared to interpret in terms that would n't have been out of place in the works of Louisa May Alcott . In that passage in Galatians where Saint Paul wrote that there were certain troublemakers who he wished would go out and castrate themselves , Brownie explained once that far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their best interests at heart . " Think of all the trouble it would save certain poor souls , dear , " I remember his saying , " not to have anything down there for the Devil to pull them around with any more . " His calling people dear was another case in point . He called everybody dear no matter who they were , and after the first shock of hearing him do it , you realized it was just another example of the same thing . It may be true that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , but by calling everything a rose indiscriminately , he could sell you the idea that even skunk cabbage had a sweetness all of its own . And then there was of course his smile . Brownie 's smile was the creation in part of the low hung set of china teeth he wore , and like those teeth it was fixed so firmly in place that it kept right on smiling even when on the inside Brownie himself ca n't have felt much like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling down from behind his glasses , those glasses with the heavy tortoise-shell rims on top of the lenses only which gave him a look of perpetual desperation . Brownie 's smile was the smile of the man in the old joke who says that the only time the arrow in his back hurts him is when he laughs . Brownie phoned me at Mrs. Gunther 's the morning after my meeting with Sharon at the shop and invited me to spend Christmas with him at the Red Pathp117Ranch . He said , " I have heard from Mr. Bebb these are troubled times for you , dear , and I want you to know that the latch string is always out . " " Brownie , " I said , " you do n't know the half of it , " and standing there under the stairs in my bathrobe and slippers with Mrs. Gunther 's mortuary curios gathering dust all around me and my tap water Maxim keeping warm on the radiator in my room , I told him I would catch the first plane I could get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and Billie Kling , and Metzger , after all , had both Mrs. Gunther and his TV , so it was n't as if I was abandoning anybody . The last time I had seen the ranch was some four years earlier soon after Lucille had died there with her life slipping out of her wrists as she rocked back and forth in her chair in the dark and listened to the sounds of poor Brownie , all unaware , reading Scripture . The residential compound of tile-roofed mission houses , HermanRedpath 's swimming pool , Holy Love built to look like the Alamo with its carillon that sent Lead Kindly Light and When I Survey the Wondrous Cross tremblingout over the scrubby flatlands as far as the greenhouseand John Turtle 's Tom Thumb golf course  --  it all seemed much the same to me . Going on a hundred and eleven , Maudie Redpath was still in circulation looking as though it was only her peekaboo blouse that held her together . Ever since doing that birthday dance by which she had so nearly succeeded in changing herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six feet off the ground as far as the swimming pool , she had been none too steady on her feet , but she still got wherep118she wanted to go in Johnson Badger 's electric golf cart . Bea Trionka had lost seventy-five pounds , she said , but she still looked as much as ever like a pan-fried Pope John the Twenty-third . Harry Hocktaw , that moon-faced tabby cat , met me at the airport in huaraches and a Harry Truman sport shirt looking no older than he had on the afternoon I had heard him trying either to hold death off or give him a royal welcome by rattling a dried gourd full of seeds in an erratic and absent-minded way while Herman Redpath slowly melted away like chocolatein a room full of kinsmen including all the blackhairedpapooses he boasted of having begotten on one or another of the ladies present . And John Turtle was there , the joking Cousin himself . He was the one who was on hand to greet me at Brownie 's house when I arrived from the airport  --  Brownie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , with his gold-framed teeth flashing  --  and he was the one with whom I spent the most memorable part of my first and only Texan Christmas Eve . The function of a Joking Cousin is hard to put your finger on , and none of the books about Indians that I have tried looking it up in has ever been much help . In general a Joking Cousin is somewhere between the Lone Ranger and the Marx Brothers . His job is to be on hand at all the most holy occasions in the life of a tribe , like deaths and marriages and major real estate transactions , and to ham them up in as many appalling and unholy ways as he can think of . When they had Herman Redpathlaid out in his satin box at Holy Love , for instance , it was the Joking Cousin who went over and took a leak on him . Bebb told me once that he thought what the Joking Cousin was up to was trying to keep the evilp119spirits from realizing how holy the occasions were becausethat way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the Great Spirit himself the Joking Cousin was trying to hoodwink with his shenanigans , the Great Spirit as Margaret Dumont . In any case , John Turtle was there with the rest of them that Christmas Eve . Brownie was living in the house that had once been Bebb 's and Lucille 's and invitedall the Indians in for supper . Lizard Shoptall was there with his jazz combo so there could be dancing . The Johnson Badgers were there with their troublesome nephew Buck who had once gotten himself stuck in an Electrolux . Maudie Redpath was there wearing a gardeniabehind an ear that looked like a smoked oyster . Bea Trionka came with her three daughters and their husbands and children , and there was a wide representation of Poles and Hocktaws . Harry Hocktaw and his sons set off some fireworks out on the terrace , and through the picture window we watched skyrockets , pinwheels , and clouds of different colored smoke light up the sultry Texan night while Lizard Shoptall and his boys belted out some of the racier carols like I Saw Mommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Two Front Teeth . There was a tree , of course , decorated entirely with things to eat like strings of popcorn and cranberries , kumquats and marshmallows and braids of red licorice . For the cocktail hour Brownie had put together a temperance eggnog which looked and tasted like Wildroot Hair Oil , but when some of the Indians brought along whiskey , Brownie raised no objection . He spent most of the time before supper out in the kitchen getting things ready , and I joined him there after a while not because all the noise in the living room was too noisyp120but because there kept being moments when it made the silence inside myself seem too silent . He had on a frilly apron that must have been left over from Lucille 's day and his sleeves rolled up so that his pale , hairy arms were bare to the elbow . There were dark sweat stains under his arms , and every time he bent over to stir something or peer into the oven , his china smile looked so precariousI was afraid it might turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jack Horner pie . He said , " It 's a little hard to remember what day this is , is n't it , dear ? It 's hard to think of the Savior 's birth except in northern climes where there 's a fire crackling on the hearth and the snow is coming down . " I said , " Even up north it 's not always that easy , Brownie . " Brownie said , " How 's Sharon , dear ? How 's the baby ? " I said they were great . " Some ways , " Brownie said , " Christmas is a sad time for all of us . The snows of yesteryear , dear . " When suppertime came , Brownie gave a blessing with a lot of peace on earth in it and tidings of great joy and glory to God in the highest , and everybody started poppingsnappers at each other and blowing out long paper buzzers with feathers on the ends . To eat , there was chile and tortillas and tamales and a huge trough of green salad full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were lots of other things too , Indian things with names I had never heard of , some of them corn on the cob yellow and sweet , some of them bitter and dark . But the main thing was one of Roland Birdbear 's piglets . Lily Trionka brought it in on a platter and set it down in front of Brownie . It had its small , fat legs tucked in under it withp121the trotters cut off , and its chin rested on a pillow of parsley and aluminum wrap . Its eye-sockets were empty and puckered up , and in the silly little grin of its mouth there was a silver dollar . Its rubbery snout was scorched on the underside , and it looked so much the size and shape of a baby that when Brownie started in to carve it , I looked the other way . There was plenty to look at . When Roosevelt Pole arrived dressed up like Santa Claus with a clothes mop beard and his paunch swelling out over a pair of skintight red bathing trunks and the fuzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried over his shoulder turned out to be full of dry ice and cans of beer so cold it made your throat ache . For the childrenhe had sarsaparilla and frozen bananas dipped in chocolate and grated peanuts , and some of the children put pieces of dry ice in their sarsaparilla so that billows of milk-white vapor slid out over the table like ground mist . Old Maudie Redpath got so carried away she threatened to try dancing herself into a blackbird again , but Harry Hocktaw , who had been the one to pull her out of the swimming pool the last time she 'd tried it , talked her into singing a song instead . She said it was a song that was supposed to restore your potency in case you had lost it and consisted of one series after another of very high , rapid notes that sounded like a bosun 's whistle with Harry Hocktaw filling in the silence betweenseries by shaking his dried gourd full of seeds . John Turtle took over while the dishes were being cleared off . He had brought along his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to flatten out and slide like the mist from the dry ice he sang a number of carols , some of them straight and some of them not straight . He sang 0 come all ye faithful and Godp122rest you Mary Musclebound . He sang The first Noel and It came upon a Greyhound bus . " Silent knife , holy knife , all is man on top his wife , " he sang with the veins on his neck standing out . Everybody who was n't doing something else joined in on I 'm dreaming of a white Christmas , and then he did a solo of " We three strings of Turtle 's guitar . Ho ho ho , and har har har . " Brownie asked for 0 little town of Bethlehem , and when John Turtle finished that he went off into " Away in a manger , so hot and so sad , the little lord Jesus raise up all he had , " and Brownie whispered to me , " You have to remember they 're just children , dear . They do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How 's Sharon ? " not remembering that he 'd already asked me that , and this time I decided I 'd tell him something different . He looked so pillaged and distracted sitting there over the wreckage of the meal with most of the Indians on their feet and milling around by this time that I figured he probably would n't hear me anyway . I said , " Brownie , do you believe in reincarnation ? " He said , " That 's not a Christian belief , dear . " I said , " Does that mean it 's wrong ? " " It means I do n't have to believe it , " Brownie said . " I 've got enough to believe as it is . " " If it 's true , it explains a lot of things , " I said . " Like what ? " Brownie said . I said , " Well for one thing it explains why some people are born young and some people are born old . I think Sharon was born old . I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why life has got to add up to more for her to make it worth her while . She 's been around too many times to just settle for the same oldp123shit . She gets restless . " There was something about Brownie that made you want to use words like shit even though you hated yourself while you were using them . He said , " You know the old prayer . Keep me ever restless until I find my rest in thee . ' " " She is n't restless for rest , " I said . " Rest does n't mean a nap , dear , " Brownie said . " It means peace . " I said , " What is peace , Brownie ? " I knew I sounded like Pilate as I said it , very cool and Ivy League , but my tone was mostly the product of my vocal chords just as Brownie 's smile was mostly the product of his teeth because on the inside I did n't feel cool at all and asked the question , as for all I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer . He was scraping dirty plates as I passed them up to him , and he paused with one of them in his hand , looking down at it as though maybe what he was looking for lay buried in the scraps . He said , " Whatever peace is , we know it best from the empty place in our hearts where it 's supposed to be . Until we find it , dear , we 're all strangers and pilgrims on the earth . " " I hope you find it , Brownie , " I said . Brownie reached over and pressed my hand . He said , " I think of you as one of my dearest friends . " But for all the kindness of his words , I felt the part of his heart they came from was not so much the part he loved his friends with as it was the empty part . Later on that evening , by the time my son Bill would have pinned up his stocking and gone to sleep with thep124Charlie McCarthy that Tony had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutton , and while it was ringing once , twice , three times , and as clearly as I could see the bare hall where I stood , I could see Sharon come out of the bathroom in the terry cloth beachrobe she wore for a wrapper and walk across to the table by my side of the bed where the phone was . I could see the way she sat down on the bed , tucking one bare foot up into her lap , and the way her hair fell as she leaned over to pick up the phone . Just as her fingers touched the receiver , I hung up . Some of the Indians had gone home or passed out by then , but there were still plenty of them in the living room watching TV , dozing , playing cards and so on , and out in the kitchen the big clean-up was still going strong . Brownie and the Trionkas were doing the lion 's share , and the air was so steamed up from many runs of the dishwasher that the black hair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could see the outline of Brownie 's underwear where he had soaked through his shirt . John Turtle had taken his shirt off and was sitting naked to the waist at the kitchen table where the slops for Roland Birdbear 's pigs were piled high in front of him . His hairless , brown chest was ribbed like a washboard , and he was drinking a can of beer . He called out to me in the hall to come take a load off my feet , and I went into the kitchen and took the chair opposite him . There was a long-legged yellow dog cleaning himself under the tail over in one corner , and John Turtle said , " If I could lick old rusty like that , I 'd even give up Tom Thumb golf . " " You got a dirty mouth , " Lily Trionka said to him over her shoulder.  | " You got big tits , " John Turtle said and from the pile in front of him winged a piece of pig at the dog who swallowed it like a pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Turtle smiled at me in a penetrating way and scratched himself in one cavernous armpit . He said , " Joy to the world , cousin . Time for puff-puff now . " Out of his pants pocket he pulled a small pipe . It was made of clay like the kind they sell on Saint Patrick 's Day , only around the bowl the white of it had turned yellow from use . He also pulled out a small leather bag with draw strings and filled the pipe out of it with something that looked blacker than any tobacco I was used to , more like tea . He tamped it down hard with his thumb and then added a little more . He struck a long kitchen match and waiting for the sulphur to burn off lowered it with care to the bowl of his pipe . The mixture he was using was so dry that when he sucked the flame down into it , there was a little bubble of fire mixed in with the first cloud of smoke . It made him sneeze , a loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it sprayed out over the slops . Then he took a long drag and with his eyes shut held it in for a while before letting it flare slowly from his lips and nostrils . The second drag he held in an equal amount of time but then with his cheeks puffed out like the South Wind on an old map blew it toward me in a blue stream . " Like that smell ? " he said . I said , " It smells like somebody set fire to a wig . " He said , " OK , Wig . Now you go puff-puff , " and held the pipe out to me across the table . God knows it was the last thing in the world I felt like , but remembering about peace-pipes and Indiansp126and not wanting to give a Joking Cousin offense , I took it from him and held the wet bit to my lips . " Two puff-puffs , " John Turtle said . " One for earth and one for sky . " He sat there picking his nose and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff I took burned my tongue and brought tears to my eyes , and as I exhaled it , the inside of my head felt mentholated and foolish and the ends of my fingers went numb . " Do n't forget earth , " I heard John Turtle say as if from some distance , and at the second puff a cloud of nausea swelled up from my stomach and my face turned cold . First I thought I was going to be sick , and then I thought I was going to die . Then I thought I was sick and dead both . Along the side of big roads you sometimes find a billboardpainted on something like a Venetian blind so that when the slats are tilted one way , there is one picture , and then , when by some inner gadgetry the slats are tilted the other way , there gradually appears another picture , and that is how it happened there in Brownie 's kitchen . First I was looking at one thing , then I was looking at another . John Turtle and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reminded me of some of the back country around Armadillo , Florida . The sun was directly overhead and the sky had a bleached-out look from the heat of it . There were some spindly palm trees off in the direction we were moving , and a few white cattle-egrets picking around among the cowflops . John Turtle was kicking up the dust with hisp127bare feet as we walked and at the same time singing a song that he matched roughly to the rhythm of his stride . He sang , Tell me the story about them feet , Joking Cousin , What 's the story about them feet ? Right foot , he 's walk a hundred mile and left foot only sixty , But they sweet on each other just like sugar all the same . How about them two hands , joking Cousin ? How 's about them hands ? Well , the one 's for fooling around with and the other 's for wiping your assBut when they starts in clapping , makes folks want to dance . What 's up with that old pecker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old pecker , there 's just one of him and he do n't got much to say , But he always smiling anyhow with his little pink eye . I said , " There 's something following us , Joking Cousin . " I did n't want to look behind either for fear I 'd see it or for fear I would n't see it , but I wanted John Turtle to look behind . He did n't . He was holding his left shoulder with his right hand and his right shoulder with his left hand , and he shimmied from side to side as he walked . " Listen , " I said . " Do you hear anything ? " We both of us stopped , and John Turtle let go one shoulder and cupped his ear with his hand . He said , " I hear something all right . " He crouchedp128down to a squat and I thought maybe he was going to flatten his ear to the ground like a scout . Instead he fumbled around in the dust with his long brown fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the pebble in his mouth and rolled it around so I could hear the clicking of it against his teeth . I said , " Flow come you did that ? " " That stone was thirsty something cruel , " he said . I turned and looked over my shoulder . The view behind us was just like the view ahead of us  --  miles of empty plain , an egret or two . The quiet of it was like the quiet in between the verses of the Joking Cousin song . " What you see , cousin ? " John Turtle said . He said it thickly with the pebble still in his mouth bulging out one cheek . He was still squatting in the dust , and he had a feather stuck in his greasy black hair . I said , " I do n't know as I see anything . " I remembered somebody telling me once that the way to see things far off is to look above where you think they are because you can see more out of the corner of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried letting my gaze travel slowly from left to right just a little above the horizon , and once I thought I saw a small , dark shape moving along close to the ground maybe a mile or so away , but when I lowered my eyes to look at it directly , it was n't there . John Turtle took the pebble out of his mouth and held it in his fingers . It glistened like a pearl with his spit on it . He put it back on the ground , covered it over , and messed the dust up all around it so you could n't tell where it was any more . We walked quite a long way in silence then , and it was such a restful , warm day and the walking was so easy along that dusty scrub that for long stretches at a time Ip129quite enjoyed myself . But every once in a while it would be like when you 've lost yourself in a good movie , and then all of a sudden you remember something sad and hard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments you and your self are back eyeball to eyeball again and your stomach turns over inside you . Every once in a while as John Turtle and I walked along , I remembered in the midst of all the pleasantness of it that something hard and sad was bearing down on me from behind , and every time I remembered it , my stomachturned over inside me . I did n't mention this feeling to John Turtle , but maybe he sensed it because he started reeling off a lot of old jokes . He told me the one about what the Indian said to the mermaid and another one about what the big dog said to the little dog and a few others which I 've forgotten , and at one point we both of us got to laughing so hard that we leaned on each other with our arms wrapped around each other 's shoulders , and the smell of his sweat was so much like chicken broth and the smell of his breath so much like honeydew that I buried my face against his slippery , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shape was that was following us showed up just then , the chances are I would n't even notice it . Then John Turtle said , " You know what the little piggy went to market say ? " and I told him I did n't . John Turtle said , " He say Wee wee wee all the way home , " and at that point I was n't laughing any more and not not noticing things and my stomach did n't turn over so much as it turned inside out because I suddenly knew what that small dark shape was I had seen out of the corner of my eye . It was the pig Brownie had served us for supper . I could see the way it had looked when Lily Trionkap130brought it in on the platter with the silver dollar in its mouth , exactly how it had looked without one detail spared me . I could see its little puckered up eye sockets and its cut-off feet . I could see the turned up corners of its mouth . I could see the scorched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it down  --  the meat had a sweetish taste to it and was so tender that it tended to fall apart in your mouth  --  but I had had my share right along with the rest of them , and I knew it was after me now with a vengeance . As clearly as I could see John Turtle , I could see it scuttling along through the white birds and moving as fast as it could on what was left of its hoofless stumps . I could see its gay , appalling little smile . " Is n't there some place to hide ? " I said to John Turtle as if my life depended on it because I was absolutely certain that it did . He said , " Which place you want anyhow ? " and " That one , " I said . " I want that one over there . " Not more than a few hundred yards ahead of us there was a high fence made of heavy wire mesh such as you find in zoos , and there was a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving John Turtle in my dust , I sprinted through them . There was a stream across my path , and I ran down into it sending great fans of water dazzling up into the air as I splashed my way to the far bank and clambered out on all fours . I tore off down the path on the other side not daring even to think about looking back and followed it on through a groove of palmetto and yucca and straight ahead till a big outcropping of tan rock barred my way and I had to loop around it . It was on the other side of those rocks that I came out into a place I knew I 'd seen before.  |p131It  was a mangy , zoo-colored place , roughly circular in shape , and the yellowish earth of it was packed down velvety hard . Around the fringes of it there were some scraggly palms and a few other trees I could n't identify that had trunks that looked like cement and greenish brown leaves as big as picnic plates . From the trees , the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center there was a wide pool with some patches of high grass growing here and there around the edge . It reminded me of pictures I 've seen of African water holes , and then I remembered what the place was and when I had been there before . It was a kind of outdoor menagerie and tourist trap called Lion Country where you paid your money at the gate and then were free to cruise around wherever you felt like it watching the uncaged animals through your car windows . The last time I 'd been there was way back when I first met Sharon , and Bebb had driven us out for the afternoon from Armadillo because he said it was the unwindingest place he knew and he needed to unwind . It had never crossed my mind that I 'd have occasion to see it again , and standing there looking at it now I thought to myself , well , there it is , and in a lazy , semitropicalkind of way the place seemed to be saying the same thing to me . Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like seeing old friends . A pair of them was sauntering along the far shore of the pond with their narrow hips and heavy , sunflower heads . A lioness with half-closed eyes was suckling some cubs under one of the cement trees . An old male with its tail out straight like a pump handle was taking a crap . Another was crouching by the pool to drink , and ripples drifted slowly out over the water from his lapping tongue.  |p132Out  toward the middle of the pool something was moving toward me that I thought at first might be a water lily cut adrift or the snout of an alligator , but as it drew nearer I could see it was somebody swimming . All I could see was just the head and every once in a while one of the hands when it broke the surface of the water as the swimmer sculled slowly backwards . When the figure was still some five feet from shore , it stood up , and I saw that it was a woman . When the woman turned around , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , I saw that it was my mother-in-law , Lucille Yancey Bebb . She had on a two-piece bathing suit that hung loose about her flat chest and skinny thighs , and on her head , with the flap over one ear turned back , she wore a bathing cap covered all over with rubber petals . She had on her dark glasses , and when she made it to dry ground , she paused for a moment to take them off and wipe her eyes underneath . Then she put them back on and padded her way up the hard-packed yellow earth toward me . I have learned from sad experience that when you run into the dead in your dreams , it is just as well not to try engaging them in conversation . They almost never seem as glad to see you as you are to see them , and if you go up with your arms outstretched and years ' worth of gossip on your lips , more often than not they wo n't even try to look interested . So I just stood my ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she finally reached me , I did n't say a word , and she did n't say a word either . She just let her jaw drop slightly in what I knew from experience was a smile and reached out to take me by the hand . In silence she led me up to one of the largest of the palm trees and showed me I wasp133to sit down . Then she peeled off her petaled bathing cap and sat down near me . I can still remember the peace of that moment with the trunk of the palm tree between my shoulder blades and no need to run any more , with crazy John Turtle lost somewhere in the outer fringes of Lion Country and the lions themselves going about business as usual as though there was n't a human being within a thousand miles . I do n't know how long we sat there , Lucille and I , until out of the corner of my eye I caught sight of some movement and turned my head to find my sister Miriam standing not far away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of florist 's lilac-colored ribbon , and because the long , burnoose-like robe she was wearing reached the ground , I was afraid for a moment that maybe underneath they still had her in that awful A-shaped cast she 'd died in and that she could n't move . But when she saw I had noticed her , she came over to me and this time it was more than I could do not to say anything so I said her name . She said , " Ciao , mio taro , " in a rather hushed way and sat down on the other side of me from Lucille . Everything was quiet . The lion at the pool 's edge finished drinking , and the surface flattened out . The lioness who had been suckling her cubs was also through . She had one of them between her front paws and was washing him with long , upward sweeps of her tongue . A low-hanging , brown palm leaf gave a papery rattle above my head , but otherwise there was no sound to speak of . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcropping of sand-colored stone . I had no trouble recognizing who they were . The taller one in back was John Turtle . The shorter one in front was Herman Red/path . They were both naked , and Herman Redpath was carrying a shoulder-high staff with a bunch of feathers fastened at the top . Herman Redpath was n't all dried up and wizened the way I had known him , with the skin of his face pulled so tight he could n't get his lips closed over his teeth right . Instead he was shiny and supple like a piece of well-oiled leather and I would have said he looked years younger except that years younger would mean he still had old age ahead of him , whereas the impression he gave me was that he had it somehow behind him as if it was a nut that had split open and the Herman Redpath I was looking at was the meat inside . He walked up to where I was sitting between Lucille and my sister and then stopped . John Turtle squatted down on his heels a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted the end of it squarely in the center of one of my shins . First on that shin and then on the other he drew with his staff a series of little dots like the markings on dice from the knee down to the ankle . " Those are wolf tracks , " he said . " They 're so you wo n't ever get wore out . " Then on the insteps of my two bare feet he drew a small cluster of x shapes from the ankle down to the toes . " Those are dragonflies , " he said . " They 're so you wo n't ever run into more trouble than you can handle . " He paused for a moment then , that sawed-off little Sioux , that oil-rich Ojibway , and looked at me as if maybe now it was my turn to do something , but not knowing what he expected , I did n't do anything , and he continued . With his staff he tipped my feet up so theyp135were resting on their heels , and on each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , " he said . " They 're so as you can walk from hill to hill without ever bogging down in the valleys . " While all this was going on , I could n't help noticing that , squatting on the ground behind him , John Turtle had started in playing with himself in a kind of desultory way , but just as he showed signs of having more to handle than what he 'd started out with , he picked up a dried gourd like Harry Hocktaw 's from the ground beside him and started playing with that instead . Chickachicka , chicka-chicka went the seeds inside . Herman Redpath turned his staff the other way round and aimed it roughly at my heart . With the feathered end this time he drew a large circle on my chest starting from the pit of my throat , around the outside of one nipple , down almost as far as the navel , and then up around the other nipple to the throat again . " That is the teepee circle , " he said . " It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in out of the rain . " Chick-chicka , chicka-chick-chick went John Turtle 's rattle in a slower , more elusive rhythm . Like priests turning to face the altar , he and Herman Redpath had both turned around to look at the water hole as I was . Herman Redpath reached up and took hold of a small whistle I had noticed hanging around his neck on a leather bootlace . He raised it to his lips and gave two sharp tweets . And there it was  --  the pig , the same pig Lily Trionka had carried in on a platter . It appeared on the other side of the pool , hesitated for a moment , and then came trottingaround the shoreline skirting the patches of high grass . Its stumpy legs and dainty hooves were a blur , theyp136moved so fast . Its rump waggled from side to side with its tail curled up like a Greek alpha . Its oversized ears were cocked forward , veined and rose-colored with the sun shining through them . Its snout was close to the ground . Its eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' When it reached where I was sitting , it settled down on its hindquarters and raised its head a little . I reached out with one hand and touched the end of its snout . It felt cool and wet and gritty , like Lava soap . Then it opened its mouth and dropped into my hand the silver dollar . On the dollar there was something written , and  --  how do I say it ? What was written on it was n't Antonio Parr or Tono or Bopper or Sir or any of the other names I 've been called by various people at various times in my life , and yet it was my name . It was a name so secret that I would n't tell it even if I remembered it , and I do n't remember it . But if anybody were ever to show up and call me by it , I 'd recognize it in a second , and the chances are that if the person who called me by it gave me the signal , I 'd follow him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen table with my cheek cradled in a slippery green wedge of honeydew rind . Brownie 's smile hung low above me like a new moon . He said , " He should never have made you try puff-puff , dear . You 've been sick all over your nice Christmas suit . "  |p137SOON  AFTER I got back to Sutton , there was a thaw . The temperature rose into the fifties , and off and on for two days it rained until the only snow left was in a few front yards where you could see the remains of what had once been snowmen . The earth looked as bare and vulnerable as I felt  --  sodden , olive drab grass , dog-droppings , mud . They kept Tony at school late helping lay down wooden duck-walks to the students ' parking lot and the science lab . Mrs. Gunther 's cellar flooded . Then it got cold again , and ice froze on Metzger 's TV aerial so that his reception went from bad to worse and he lost UHF almost entirely . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that comes through is ghosts . If CBS goes , I 've had it . CBS is my goddam umbilical cord . "  |p138There  was a note waiting for me from Sharon when I got back . It said , " Bill and I are taking off for a while to rest up after Christmas . Anita says she 'll keep an eye on the furnace and the mail . Bip 's been trying to get in touch with you . I guess things are closing in on him . Keep an eye on him for me . " She signed it , " Mickey Mouse . " Tony seemed morose . His vacation with his father and Billie Kling had been a flop . He said , " You know Dad . This time it was his eyes . They gave him a test for glaucoma and told him he was in great shape only the pressure in one eye was a hair higher than the other so he 's sure he 's going blind . Every half hour he 'd ask me if I noticed the light was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel my eyeballs to see if they felt any harder than his did . I mean Jesus , Tono , what kind of vacation is that having somebody feeling your eyeballs the whole time ? Besides the skiing was lousy , and I was too broke to go anyplace else so most of what I did was eat . Like I 've gained about ten pounds if you want to know the truth . " I think it was his weight that depressed him more than anything else . Every evening before he went to bed he worked out with his barbells , and mornings he 'd do jogging in place until Metzger complained . What bothered Metzger , I think , was that if he started havinga coronary , nobody would hear him give his three thumps on the wall above the thumping of my nephew 's bare feet . So Tony took to jogging outside instead , four times around the block before breakfast every day in his grey sweatsuit with a towel around his neck , fair weather and foul . He had turned twenty in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hit twenty , " he said ,  | " even a jock like me does n't stay in condition unless he works at it , " and I remember his inward-looking frown as he said it . It was partly the frown of a man who knows that staying in condition is uphill all the way and partly , I thought , the frown of a man who , after three years of Phys . Ed. , shop , and maintenance work at Sutton High , is n't sure just what he 's staying in condition for . I knew I ought to talk to him about it  --  his prospects at Sutton in particular , his future in general  --  and I suspecthe would have been grateful if I had , what with nobody else much to talk to , least of all his father . At the faintest sign that somebody wanted to talk about something that might make waves , Charlie Blaine would either go upstairs for one of his longer naps or get Billie Kling to taxi him down for an electrocardiogram . I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was gun-shy , I suppose , afraid always that he would tell me more than I wanted to know . It was a way he had . When I told him Sharon had gone away for a while , for instance , he said , " I told her she ought to fly , but she said the only way they 'd ever get her on a plane was if they let her drag her feet , so she took the bus . I told her it was a crazy way to do it , but she got me to take her to the bus station anyway . " He and Sharon had been seeing each other , in other words . There was no reason why they should n't have . He 'd never given me any reason to believe that they were n't . But I 'd never stopped to think about the possibilitybefore , and I did n't want to stop to think about it now . But Tony kept charging forward . " They 're in Armadillo , " he said . " She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't blame her , Tono . It 's no life for her up here by herself . "  |p140I  thought of the phone calls I had interrupted him at under the stairs and of how Anita Steen had told me I was n't the only thing in pants that had rung the doorbell since she had been there alone , and now whether I wanted him to or not , he was putting two and two together . We were sitting in my classroom where I 'd stayed late to correct papers , and it was raining outside . Tony was leaning up against the blackboard . He had rung the bell , and Sharon had heard it . He had come in , and she had come down . He had said something , and she had laughed maybe or not laughed , had gotten him a beer , turned on Johnny Carson , told him to take his cruddy feet off the coffee table  --  God only knew what they had done . As for me , I did n't want to know . All I knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is opened between them that not even years of noblest resolve can ever entirely close again because the flesh has a pitifully weak sense of time and honor both , and old wounds throb like new again at the approach of rain . That day in the dentist chair , for instance , my hand had found its way to Laura Fleischman 's hand so easily for the simple reason that it had been there before and knew the way even though I myself had forgotten it . And Tony and Sharon had also known the way , and whether they had followed it again in my absence and where it had led them if they had , I had no wish to find out . " Where 's she staying in Armadillo ? " I asked because it was a question that took her out of the house and away from the sound of his ringing and put her about fifteen hundred miles south . She was staying at the Salamander Motel , he told me . She 'd left him the phone number if I wanted it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hoped enigmatically . It was my attempt to end our exchange with ap141story I chose not to tell him rather than with one I chose not to have him tell me . It ended nothing . He said , " She gave a going-away party the day before she left , and I drove down from Dad 's for it . It was New Year 's Eve . Anita was there , natch , and some of her yoga class and a few health food freaks thrown in for good measure  --  nobody I knew especially . She and Anita played the guitar and there was dancing and booze and vitamins . I do n't know when old Bill got to sleep . He sat up at the top of the stairs with his legs through the rail , having a ball watching . Everybody had a ball , " he said . " The only rough part was when Sharon got sick . " " Feel free to make a long story short , " I said . " Not booze sick , " he said . " Sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health juice . She said maybe that was the trouble with her . She said you can stand only so much that 's good for you , and then you start needing something that 's bad for you , and if you do n't get it , then you start being bad for yourself . She looked awful , whatever it was . It was after everybody had gone home . She was upstairs trying to get rid of it only she could n't . She said it was because what she was trying to get rid of was herself . She scared hell out of me . " He took a piece of chalk and drew a line on the blackboardwith such a sudden , fierce stroke that the chalk snapped and fell to the floor . " That scared , " he said  --  that heavy , swift diagonal stuttering off at the lower end where the chalk had broken . He said , " You gone , Bip gone . All her friends gone that she did n't know all that much better than I did so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stuck around . I was all she had . I told Mrs. Gunther to leave the door unhooked , but I could n't just walk out and leave her . Christ . " I spent the night , " he said.  |p142I  remember the rain at the windows . They were the old-fashioned kind that open at the top with a long pole , and I took the pole and closed them because it was startingto rain in a little . There was another kind of quiet in the room then . " You want a lift home ? " I said . He was standing with his shoulders against the blackboard , the line he had drawn going through him like an arrow . He said , " She just needed somebody to hang onto , that 's all . The next morning I put them on the bus for Florida . I wanted to tell you , Tono . " I found myself thinking vaguely of Stephen Kulak , the pudgy ninth grader I 'd once explained irony to in that same classroom where now the rain was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stephen Kulak . My nephew 's wanting to tell me and my not wanting him to . Tony had his ankles crossed like Nijinsky as he looked at me through the dark and operatic eyes of my twin sister . I said , " You 're a good man , Charlie Brown . " He said , " I 'm a dumb , overweight jock . " " I did n't say that , " I said . " You said that . " He said , " I 'm sorry as hell , Tono . " " Just give me an ounce of civet , good apothecary , " I said , " to sweeten my imagination . " She did n't come back that week , Sharon . I called the house from time to time , but there was no answer , and from various places of concealment across the street I could see on various occasions that it was Anita Steen , not Sharon , who was minding things at the Sharanitap143Shop , that withered little Fauntleroy sitting behind the cash register in a cloud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that puts apples in your cheeks and helps stave off the hidden menace of hyperglycemia . Sharon did n't come back that winter at all . She wrote me that she had decided to stay on in Armadillo . She said she could think things out better down there and the people at the Salamander Motel had given her and Bill special rates . Anita had told her that she would look after the shop while she was away . Sharon did n't come back . Tony did n't tell me any more stories I 'd just as soon have passed up . The weather did n't change for better or worse but continued to ice up by night and turn to mud by day . It was a winter when nothing particular happened one way or another out where you could see it but only inside , I suppose , where luckily or unluckily you could n't see it unless you were Gertrude Conover with an eye for karmic stirrings , an ear for whispered cues from the prompter 's box . And that was fine by me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was why , although I knew Bebb was trying to get hold of me , I made no effort to get hold of him . A number of times that winter he called at Mrs. Gunther 's while I was in , but each time I got Metzger to tell him I was n't . Metzger did n't even ask me why , and I did n't spend much time asking myself why either , let alone feeling guilty about it . Whatever Bebb wanted , I did n't have it in me to give . Whatever Bebb had to give , there was n't enough of me just then to want it with . And then one day in early spring he turned up  --  at a time when I least expected him , Stephen Kulak , which was also the time when I had most reason to expect him because part of the roundness of Bebb was always , likep144the ball in a pinball machine , to pursue his goal no less relentlessly for all the bumpers , buzzers , baffles and blinking lights put in his way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in my room . He was lying on my bed in his shirtsleeveswith his tie loosened and his shoes off . He had hung his jacket neatly over the back of the desk chair with his hat perched on top of it and his shiny , black shoes lined up on the floor where his feet would have been if he had been sitting there , so that at first glance it was as if there were two Bebbs , the natty one at the desk and the mussed one on the bed . It was as if , waiting there in my room with nobody around to bother about , he had taken a break from being himself . The effect was startling . It was like coming upon Oliver Hardy resting between takes in a T-shirt and jockey shorts . He said , " It 's a day of trouble and of treading down , Antonio . That 's why Gertrude Conover gave me the loan of her Lincoln so I could drive up . The fat 's in the fire , and I need a sharp young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not as young as I once was . There 's been goings on in Princeton , New Jersey , you should have been there with your Bell and Howell to get pictures of . If you 've got a few minutes , I 'll run them off for you . " The first scene he ran off took place in the office of the Internal Revenue Service in Trenton , New jersey . Bebb said , " There was a bunch of us got letters ordering us to show up at the same time , and I was the first one to get there and the last one to get seen . Antonio , I cooled my heels the best part of three hours while one by one everybody else got called in ahead of me . There was a pane of crinkled glass like a men'sp145room , and I watched the whole pack of them through it getting their business done in there and coming out again . I looked at every wore-out magazine and dog-eared newspaper there was till finally all I had left to look at was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time they finally got round to calling my name it was the middle of the afternoon and I had n't even had my dinner yet . Inside there was a agent sitting at a big desk name of Connor . He was n't much taller than a parking meter and he had eyes rolling around in his head like marbles and a breath on him you could have got money for in a package store . He made me stand there must have been five minutes while he diddled around with some papers he had , and then he looked up at me and said , Do I have the honor of addressing the King of the Jews ? ' That miserable little pen-pusher , I gave him as good as he gave me . I said , My kingdom is not of this world , ' and he come back at me quick as a water moccasin . He said , Well , maybe your kingdom is n't , but your form 1040 sure as hell is . ' He had a secretary in there with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with where her real mouth was than the map of China and she set in to snickering . I told them I was a U.S. citizen , one , and a ordained minister of the Gospel , two , and if they thought I was going to stand there and let them use me like that , they were mistaken . " I said , " Sharon told me about your 1040 , Bip . I 'm afraid you asked for it . " " I asked for a hearing , " he said . " I did n't ask to be held up to shame and ridicule . " He said , " Antonio , it 's no secret I 've been having trouble with the IRS for going on forty years , and you want to know why ? It 's not on account of I 've cheatedp146on my income . I 've got an income . I never once let on I did n't . My finances are an open book . The love offerings , the Gospel Faith tuition fees , the nickels and dimes coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddings and funerals I 'd as soon have done for nothing except what a man does n't pay for he does n't value . And the great generosity of Herman Redpath , Antonio . I 'm including the hundred thousand too . Why , averaged out I 've had more income out of serving the Lord than most anybody I know in this type of work , and being pretty much a one man operation save for Brownie , I never had much overhead either . " He said , " Antonio , I got an income but I also got an outgo , and I 'm going to tell you where my outgo goes to . First off , I 'll tell you where it does n't go to . It does n't go to Leo Bebb . Leo Bebb has n't got any stockingfull of fifty dollar bills stuffed up the chimney . He has n't got any blue-chip securities or life insurance , and he has n't got any pension plan either . Blue Cross ? The only cross I 've got is the cross of shame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back and the incidental expenses of living , everything I 've got goes to the church . This side of starving to death , my income and my outgo are dollar for dollar the same as each other because everything I got coming in goes out to Jesus . Right down to the last dime , it all goes out to feeding his lambs just like he told us . " I said , " The trouble with that , Bip , is you do n't have a church any more , " and he said , " Antonio , I am a church . " It was one of his classic utterances , of course , one of the golden sayings or fioretti of Leo Bebb like the first time I ever met him when , after we 'd finished our busi/ness , I walked him to the Lexington Avenue subway in the rain , and just as he 'd gone about half way down those urine-smelling stairs he turned with his hand on the rail and said , " All things are lawful to me . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him what he believed , and he said , " Antonio , I believe everything , " and when I told him he made it sound almost easy , he said , " It 's hard as hell . " I am a church , he said , this new pronouncement , and I thought how in a way he looked like a church  --  some sprawling , bald-domed Hagia Sophia or chunky , sunbleachedseamen 's Bethel  --  as he lay there on my bed with the room smelling of his feet . He said , " I did the best I could to explain it all out to that pitiful little Pontius Pilate how come I filed in the name of Jesus like I did and the point I was trying to put across doing it that way . He was just about as interested as he was whether I put on clean drawers that morning . They 're going to investigate me , that 's the long and the short of it . Connor and that Jezebel with lips painted on her would n't fool a blind man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got clean back to the creation . They 're going to have me up for malfeasance and contemptand willful attempt to defraud the U.S. Government . " Antonio , " he said . " They 're going to nail me up . " That was the first scene Bebb ran off for me . The second took place at Princeton , in the Nassau Hall office of some assistant dean . The assistant dean himself was there with a beard and one of the denominational chaplainswith a turtleneck and a pectoral cross . Unlike thep148experience at the tax office , here Bebb was treated very well . The chaplain offered him a cigarette which he refused . The assistant dean showed him a clapper that had been stolen from the Nassau Hall bell in oughty something . The assistant dean inquired after Gertrude Conover , whom he knew socially . The chaplain told a little joke about a Black Muslim and a southern Baptist meeting at Saint Peter 's gate . I wondered as Bebb described it if he had recognized in that office the terrible advantage he had  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivy league . I could see them so clearly , the dean and the chaplain  --  not crew cut and gray flanneled as in my day but the dean with his beard , the chaplain with his turtleneck , trying no less to be all things to all men as with Bebb they undoubtedly fell all over themselves trying to be Bebbs . I could see them searching for prepositionsto end their sentences with  --  this is where we 're at , Mr. Bebb  --  scratching themselves where it did n't itch , wishing they 'd boned up ahead of time on Uncle Billy 's Whizzbang and the language of the sawdust trail . Bebb being Bebb would n't try to be anything else because he could n't if he wanted to , just sat there in Nassau Hall as he would have sat on the can while they dithered around him . Bebb said , " They came down to it finally , what they 'd called me in there to say . You could see they did n't want to . They 'd been put up to it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alexander Hall to me , Antonio . They have closed them and bolted them tight . " There was the mess for one thing , they told him . LoveFeasts no less than fish fries left litter  --  crumbs andwrappers , paper cups and Tropicana stains . Even afterp149the supper of the Lamb somebody had to pick up the pieces . The dean laughed at the sheer triviality of the thing , his feet propped up on an open desk drawer , but there had been flak from the janitorial staff , and good janitors were harder to find than good deans . Or good shepherds , the chaplain said . Besides which there was the eternal question of precedent , the dean said , striking while the iron was at least lukewarm . It was one thing to make Alexander Hall available to a group like Bebb 's for what had it been now  --  six weeks , two months ?  --  but to perpetuate the thing beyond that was not only to give it official University endorsement which was something the trustees might be as hesitant to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death around here these days  --  but also to open the door to you name it . Gay Lib , Leary 's boys , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Transcendental Meditators  --  ifthe University wrote Bebb a blank check , on what basis could they justify writing anything less for the Honorable Elijah Mohammed ? " Antonio , " Bebb said with his head sunk back on my pillow , gazing out at Metzger 's aerial against the grey sky , " there 's plenty I could have said , only I did n't say it . Nancy Oglethorpe , she 's got a clean-up squad goes over that place after every feast so there 's not a janitor in the business could find fault with it . And talk about your sodomite societies and your Hindu jamborees , they 're no more like  --  Antonio , Love Feast is n't some kind of Lodge or Clam Bake . I 'm not asking the Nassau Hall crowd to do any more for me than that chaplain 's asking them to do for him . I 'm there to preach the good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of cold water to the least of these my brethren , these fine young brethren they 've got there at Princeton University that are thep150salt of the earth except that they 're tempted every whichway by things like drugs and sex and knocking the American way of life . " Bebb did n't say that at this point in the interview the dean lit his pipe , but even at that remove in time and space I could smell it  --  could smell that whole world of deans and pipes and stolen clappers that I had known myself in the early fifties . God knows times have changed and maybe people do n't come as young as they used to , but even so I ca n't help believing  --  because with part of me anyway it 's of course what I want to believe  --  that for everything I knew then there is still at least a reasonable facsimile going now : the tipsy labyrinth of a football weekend and the jolt of bouncing your first check to discover that life goes on anyway ; courses in things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History , with titles so enchanted that not even taking them could ever quite break the spell . I wanted to believe that it was because the young still accepted all the ancient verities as basically unassailablethat they could afford to assail every last one of them with the abandon of apes . I wanted to believe that they too believed , just as I had once believed , in the endless procrastination of old age and death , the lifetime guarantee of boyhood friendships and the inevitable victory of the martini over the Manhattan , Mozart over Mendelssohn , marriage over masturbation . In any case , as Bebb evoked that whole never-never land by his account of his brush with it at Nassau Hall , what moved me was not the thought of how it had menaced Bebb but of how Bebb had menaced it and what a fragile thing it was . Bebb said , " The chaplain told me how way back inp151the twenties sometime there was a group like Love Feasts got started on campus where everybody collected together and confessed things in public that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come right out and say sex things , but it was what he meant mostly . He said how it got out of hand and a lot of loose talk and loose living come out of it , and it gave the place a bad smell . I told him that was n't the kind of show we were running at Alexander Hall and what was coming out of it was n't loose living , it was souls saved for Jesus . Well , the dean , he put his oar in again . He said all they had to go on was what they 'd heard tell from people who had been there . So I asked him what people , and that stopped him . He said he did n't want to get into personalities . He said there was no point naming names . And I 'm going to come clean with you , Antonio . He was right . There was no point naming names because I knew what the name was without anybody had to name it . Roebuck , Antonio . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roebuck was out to get me . " I went to see him , " Bebb said . " That same day after I finished with the Nassau Hall boys , I went straight to that little hole-in-the-wall Roebuck 's got him for an office over to McCosh Hall and put it right to him . He was there all by his self in those Army boots of his and a saucer full of cigarette butts . I said , Roebuck , you never made a secret of how you felt about me , and I never held it against you . Every man 's got a right to come to Jesus in his own way , and if my way 's not your way , there 's no hard feelings . But you 've kept on coming to the Love Feasts anyhow , and no matter what spiteful things you said , I never meant you anything but good . But all the time I was meaning you good , you meant me evil ,  |p152Roebuck  , and now you 've gone and turned this place against me . Roebuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? ' Then he took me by surprise , Antonio . I 'll give him credit for that . " He said , I believe we 've met somewhere else , Mr. Bebb . ' I did n't know what he meant , and I told him so . Let me refresh your memory , ' he said . He does n't look you in the eye when he talks to you . He looks at you up around where your hairline is , if you 've got a hairline . He makes you feel like you 've got another pair of eyes up there you never thought to use before . " Those two Bebbs . The one sitting at my desk straight as a chair-back in a Tyrolean hat and a pair of Thom McCann shoes not saying a word , buttoned up tight . The other one spread out on my bed like the stuffing of the first one . Bebb said , " That man knows his history , Antonio . It 's his special subject , and he knows it inside and out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said we 'd met before . He told about the days they had childreneight , ten years old and up working in mines like pack mules maybe twelve hours at a stretch till their pitiful little bodies were nothing but skin and bones and they could n't hardly see in the daylight while people like me went on looking the other direction and preaching thy kingdom come . He told about the days they tore the living flesh off people with red-hot tongs and broke their legs with hammers because they did n't believe like they should about doctrine . He went on how those old-time crusaders used religion for an excuse to rape women and raise hell and how back in slavery times there was ministers of the Gospel owned slaves just like everybody else and proved out of scripture it was the way thingsp153was meant to be . I do n't suppose there was a single miserable thing anybody ever did in the name of Jesus that Roebuck did n't spell out chapter and verse before he was done . He enjoyed it . You could tell from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was having . " He said each one of those times and places I was there , Antonio , and that 's where we met before . He said I was n't the type that beat the slaves and raped the women and tortured the heretics because I did n't have the balls for it . No , I was the type just closed my eyes to it and helped other people close their eyes to it by telling them a lot of fairy tales about Heaven . This trick eyelid of mine that goes shut on me sometimes without me even knowing about it , Roebuck said you did n't have to be a expert psychologist to explain that . He said that eyelid was a dead giveaway how the only way a man like me can go on believing in Almighty God is by pulling that eyelid down like a window blind between me and all the shit in the world that proves there is n't any Almighty God and never was or will be . " You take a word like shit , Antonio . A preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words , and Roebuck , he thought he 'd throw me a curve just using it . I said , Roebuck , you think I do n't know about shit ? What you 've been telling me about is n't even a millionthpart of all the shit there is because you 've stuck to just the religious shit , and that 's only one kind of all there is because piled up right alongside it there 's a million other kinds . You take your big business , your politicians , your high-class colleges like Princeton . You take your haves and your have-nots both , your whorehousesand your W.C.T.U. 's . You take not just your rednecknigger-haters but your N double A 's and your civilp154rights parades , not just your hard-hat flagwavers but your peaceniks and C.O. 's and love-ins . You take anything people have ever done in this world , and the best you can say about any of it is that it 's maybe one part honest and well-meant and the other nine parts shit . If I close my eyelid down on all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to face up to all the shit there is in me , because I 'm full of it too , Roebuck . I 'm not denying it . And you 're full of it . It 's the shit in us is part of what makes us brothers , you and me . ' I used that word shit to him till it begun to sound like I invented it . " He caught me by surprise . I caught him by surprise . A preacher talking about things like  --  Antonio , shit is what preachers have been talking about since Moses except the word they 're more like to use is sin . Only Roebuck did n't know that . It shut him up for a minute . Then he said , If the world 's mostly shit , Bebb , where 's God ? ' Just like that  --  where 's God ? As if I could say , Look , there he is , Roebuck , He 's squeezed into one of those books you got on your shelves . He 's out there a zillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty winks over in Alexander Hall till the next Love Feast gets off the ground . ' That Roebuck was like a bird floating in the sky asking where 's air , only I did n't say that then because I did n't think of it till later . " I said , I 'll tell you about shit , Roebuck . Take it from an expert . There 's two main things about it . One thing is it 's stink and corruption and waste . The other thing is if you do n't pile it up too thick in any one place , it makes the seeds grow . ' I said , Roebuck , God 's where there 's seeds growing . God 's where there 's something no bigger than the head of a pin starting to inch up out of the stink and dark of shit towards the light of day . ' I said ,  |p155Roebuck  , God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son down here into the shit with the rest of us so something green could happen , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't even know what you 're talking about , Bebb , ' but I could see he knew more than he was letting on just like all of us do , Antonio . A man that believes in the Almighty knows worse than he 's letting on and a man that does n't believe in the Almighty like Roebuck knows better , but we all of us know more . I said , Maybe you do n't know what I 'm talking about , Roebuck , but I know what you 're talking about . All this about God and ancient history and so on , down deep what you 're talking about is that boy you got home ca n't use his hands and feet . That 's the main shit the world tossed in your direction , is n't it , Roebuck ? ' " He said , Bebb , he ca n't even take his pecker out when he needs to make a leak . All his life he 's going to have to have somebody around to take it out for him or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to hold a pencil in his asshole like that girl that draws Christmas cards . That 's the only green and hopeful thing he 's got . ' " Antonio , there 's a whole mess of scriptures that has to do with things like Roebuck 's boy , the pointless , dirty things that make you wonder if life 's anything more than a popcorn fart . My ways are not thy ways , saith the Lord . Fear not . I could have rattled off a dozen of them without batting an eye only I did n't have the heart to , and it would n't have made a dent on Roebuck if I had . There was n't a solitary thing I knew to say that I felt like saying , and it seemed as though Roebuck had run out of ammunition too . We both of us just sat there staring atp156each other . Then I saw something I did n't notice up till then . It was one of those little signs they have on desks with your name on it . Virgil M. Roebuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Roebuck , and then seeing that sign I thought to myself how this was n't any old Roebuck . This was the Roebuck they 'd settled on calling Virgil . This was the special Roebuck they 'd pinned that special name Virgil onto and raised up to amount to something special , and here he was , not one of your big time professors that get their pictures in the papers but just Virgil Roebuck that smokes two , three packs a day if he smokes one and has this boy he 's got to take his pecker out for him every time he needs to take a leak . " Antonio , I busted in there mad as a hornet , but you ca n't stay mad when you start thinking things like that . Once you commence noticing the lines a man 's got round his eyes and mouth and think about the hopeful way his folks gave a special name to him when he was first born into this world , you might as well give up . " I said , Virgil , the night is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How come it was the words of that old hymn popped into my mind just then to say ? I do n't know , but it did . I said , The night is dark , Virgil Roebuck , and home 's a long ways off for both of us . ' " He did n't say a word for a while . He just sat there at the desk in his Army boots and his cigarette between his teeth the way he does . Then he cupped his hand up over one eyebrow and tossed me one of those two-for-a-nickel highball salutes they used to do . He 's out for my scalp , Antonio . I 'm sure as I 'm sitting here he 's the one talked them into kicking me out of Alexander Hall . But he saluted me , Antonio , and it was n't just to mock at me either . That salute was him saying maybe we 're in twop157different battles . Maybe we 're on two different sides . But when you come right down to it , the war we 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , all of us are . Who 's going to judge which of us has got the farthest way to go through all the shit and the dark ? " Bebb swung his legs over the edge of the bed and sat up to describe the last scene to me . His shirt had come untucked in back from the way he 'd been lying and his trouser legs were hiked up baring his hairless , white calves . He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees , and I had the impulse to plump him into shape like a pillow and stuff him back into his tight-fitting jacket where he belonged . He said , " It never rains but it pours . As if it was n't enough to have the IRS and Nassau Hall both on my neck , I got a letter last week from the insurance companythat handled things back when Open Heart burned down . Of course the people we rented from was the ones that had the insurance , but being as I was the tenant when it burnt , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been using the barn for a church and so on . Everything was open and above board , and the people got money for a new barn without a hitch . Only now , four years later , the company 's opened the whole businessup again . " Somebody 's been telling tales out of school , Antonio . Back when the fire happened , it never come out Clarence Golden was living in that barn . I never made a feature of it because to tell the truth there did n't seem any cause to . I never set his name down in those forms because Fats Golden , he 's had his share of hard knocksp158in this world and then some , and I did n't want to lay any more on him . It was n't as if he was doing anything he should n't have , just camping out there because he did n't have anywheres else to lay his head . Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me , Antonio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down out there while we were overseas . I did n't see any point stirring up the insurance company over a thing like that . Well , they 've been stirred up . " They wrote me somebody 's gone and sent them an anonymous letter . Somebody 's written a letter they did n't have the crust to sign their name to telling how the summer Open Heart burned down , there was a friend of mine living in it that once a long ways back did time . I expect you know Clarence Golden did time once , Antonio . He never was one to make a secret of it . So they 're reopening the case on the grounds the fire that burned down Open Heart was n't necessarily an accident . They did n't come straight out and accuse anybody , but they said they 've got their lawyers working on it . They want me to come answer some questions . " My nose is clean , Antonio . I was n't there when that fire happened , and even if it was set on purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . I lost a lot of property including the pulpit and the undertaker chairs and the hymn books and that big preaching Bible I would n't have taken any kind of money for . It was n't me that collected on the insurance , it was the people that owned the place , and there 's not a lawyer in Christendom could prove any different . But there 's two things that keep me awake nights , and I 'll tell you the worst one first . " A man has enemies . In my line of work , it goes with the territory and you got to expect it  --  you even got to bep159thankful for it . Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake . It 's a honor to have the same kind of enemies Jesus had . Like that banty rooster tax collector , that Connor who 's trying to force me to render unto Caesar what is n't Caesar 's because it 's Jesus 's and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roebuck 's just the latest , souped up model of the fool that saith in his heart there is no God and is out to nail anybody that says different because deep down he 's scared of the competition . Roebuck 's scared . Why do you think he wears those boots of his like there was a war on ? But whoever wrote that anonymous letter and did n't sign his name to it , that 's another kind of enemy . I do n't know who it is , Antonio . I do n't know why he 's out to get me . He could be a stranger . He could be somebody I 've done some deep and hurtful thing to without even knowing it . He could be anybody , and there is n't hardly a person I know or ever did know I have n't tried fitting his face onto just for size . Even in dreams . He 's a enemy without a face that follows me even into the dreams where a man goes to find rest and guidance for the days ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some ways Clarence Golden 's the  --  five years , Antonio . Him and me , we were together five years day in day out till there was n't hardly any closer two people can come this side of matrimony . I 'm not saying there are n't times he 's an awful pain in the tail . You never know when he 's going to turn up or what way he 's going to find to devil you about something . Like the way he covered the walls of Open Heart with pictures straight out of my life , private things , Antonio , I could no more have left up there for the world to see if that fire had n't happenedp160than I could have stood up and preached the Kingdom buck naked . But he 's my old friend , and I do n't want any harm to come to him , and now he 's in worse trouble than I am , and it 's on my account he 's in it . When those insurance lawyers start looking into things , they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at his feet all this time , but at this point he looked up at me , and for one moment his trick eyelid fluttered . He said , " Antonio , Clarence Golden is a firebug . What those lawyers are bound to dig up about him is the thing he did time for way back was arson . " Thus the woes of Leo Bebb . He stood up , ready by then to move out , go somewhere , and I stood up too , ready , God knows , to have him go . He threw his arms up over his head in a monumental stretch , groaning and making faces , tossing his fat shoulders around to loosen them up , and I found myself echoing his gesture so that we stood there facing each other for a moment both with our arms in the air . Our woes met , Bebb 's spoken and mine unspoken becausehow was Ito speak to him of Sharon and Tony holdingon to each other for dear life ? It was like a high sea at the beach when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teeth-rattling slap and sky-high explosion of foam  --  Bebb 's speech and my silence meetinghead-on with such a jolt that it had us both on our feet like fans at a touchdown . Conner . Roebuck . The writer of the anonymous letter . The possibility that they would all somehow get together to overthrow Bebb if in some subterranean wayp161they had n't gotten together already , were n't in fact all three the same person in three clever disguises . Bebb was n't there for either my advice or my condolences , however , and whatever fumbling combination of the two I started to serve him up he literally turned his back on as he vigorously set about putting himself back together again  --  tucking in his shirt , tightening up his tie , putting back on his jacket and shiny black shoes , until there was only one Bebb again , as buttoned up and battened down as ever . He was also apparently not there to inquire into the state of things between Sharon and me . At the diner later , where he insisted on paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at raising the subject but waited until I had my mouth full of cheeseburger to do it and by the time I 'd swallowed enough to choke out something about how there was n't really much new , he was off into plans for a student demonstration against NassauHall for exiling him from the campus . I do n't know why Bebb was there . All I knew was that not even the rock of ages can cleave for thee very well when it 's round as a pumpkin and rolling downhill at seventy-five miles per hour.  | " LAURA ? " I said . " This is Antonio Parr . " Not Antonio . It was too soon for that . Not Mr. Parr . It was too late for that . I was using the phone underneath the stairs . The kitchen door was open , and I could see Mrs. Gunther opening a can of Puss ' n Boots . She had the radio on with the dial set somewhere between the six o'clock news and the bagpipe version of Amazing Grace . UpstairsTony was taking a shower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud . The cat Mrs. Gunther was fixing supper for was stretched out on the glass top of a display case full of hat pins and souvenir spoons with one paw hanging over the edge . " Oh my goodness , " Laura Fleischman said . " I thought I recognized your voice . "  |p163I  knew where everybody in the house was at that moment , and looking back on it , I picture where everybody else was at that moment too . Sharon is at the gas station across the road from the Salamander Motel . There is a sandwich machine out front , and she is standing in front of it in a halter and shorts while Bill reaches up to drop the money in . The sun is blinding on the white stucco gas station wall and on the white road . Spring has come to Gouverneur Road , and Bebb and Gertrude Conover are coming home from a drive with Gertrude Conover at the wheel . She sits with her chin pointed down toward one shoulder and seems to be gazing as much out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving she looks like a passenger . As they turn into the driveway of Revonoc , Bebb reaches out through the window like a Chinese emperor and breaks off a sprig of forsythia . Nancy Oglethorpe is typing out a dissertation on The Civil Service Reforms of Chester A. Arthur , and as she leans forward to make an erasure , her breasts crush against the keys and trigger the tabulator which slams the carriage back to the farthest margin and rings the bell . Charlie Blaine is walking slowly from the garage back to the kitchen porch . He steps on a crocus without knowing it and skins his bare arm against the side of the house . His eyes are closed because he is checking out what it is going to be like to be blind . Darius Bildabian has stayed overtime at his office to make some denture repairs . With an upper plate in one hand and a lower plate in the other , he holds them out at arms ' length through the curtained door of the waitingroom where his twelve year old son Mardik is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them say , " What 's up , Doc ? " Roebuck , a red bandanna handkerchief tied around his forehead like a pirate , is playing squash with a colleaguefrom the Philosophy Department , and after a long day at the shop , Anita Steen is soaking in a hot tub with a bourbon on the floor beside her and a copy of Rod McKuen in one dry claw . I say , " Does that invitation for a homecooked meal still hold ? " " You mean tonight ? " Laura Fleischman says . In the background I can hear a noise like a car going over railroad tracks . " Let me turn the washer off . " At the unmistakable sound of Mrs. Gunther 's setting the plastic dish down on the linoleum , the cat drops lightly to the floor and starts toward the kitchen hugging the wall with her tail in the air . A thump overhead makes me wonder for a moment if Metzger is signaling for help at last , but craning out as far as the telephone cord will let me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalks heavy-footed to his bedroom and think to myself that it is not given to every man to behold with such Olympian detachment the nakedness of his wife 's lover . " Look , " Laura Fleischman said , " I just checked the ice box , and I mean if you do n't mind taking pot luck , I can whip up something if you want to come over . Mother had to go to Toledo because her sister 's dying , so there 's just me . " " And we will take upon us the mystery of things , " I said for lack of anything else . " As if we were God 's spies . " The mystery of things . To year after year of Suttonp165High seniors I have explained that what the old king seems to mean is that only God and his spies see that it is the things themselves that are the mystery  --  all the people there are , in all the places there are , doing all the things they are doing at any given moment of time . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same moment Mrs. Fleischman 's sister was dying in Toledo and upstairs Tony Blaine was studying his young flesh in his dresser mirror for signs of advancing middle age . All the people in the world are always doing something , somewhere , and for all I know the dead are too  --  Lucille floating like a water lily in the lion 's pool and Herman Redpath with his whistle around his neck . In a classroom smelling of steam heat , chalk dust , flatulence , pencils , hair spray , breath  --  themselves all part of the mystery  --  I tried over the years to explain that to see things the way Lear says God sees them is not so much to see through them to some mystery beyond or within as just to see them as they are . As mysteries go , that is staggering enough for anybody . I clipped my fingernails . I put on a clean shirt . I took two of the vitamin C pills Sharon had given me . I picked up a fifth of Dewar 's on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura Fleischman 's house before , the chief mystery of which was that for a house that had seen all twenty-odd years of her comings and goings , it seemed to have left as little mark on her as she on it . The nubbly wall-to-wall carpet of swimming pool blue , the Barcalounger in homespun vinyl , the cataract stare of the TV which wore like an old lady 's hat a foilwrappedpot of African violets on a crocheted doily and the what-not shelf of Reader 's Digest condensed books with a tinted photograph of the late Mr. Fleischman onp166top  --  to have an eye for the kind of things that mark the boundaries between classes in a classless society is curse enough let alone to blunder into marking them sharper still as I knew I had the moment I produced my fifth of Dewar 's and set it down on Mrs. Fleischman 's sewing table . A drink before dinner  --  I had grown up in a world where that eloquent little semicolon between the clauses of a day was as inevitable as day itself . Even alone at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revonoc Gertrude Conover did and elsewhere all the blue-haired ladies and the old Tigers and Elis they were married to . More than the clothes we wear or the language we speak , it is the final shibboleth that will give us away when the African violets and tinted photographs of the world rise against us at last , and all I can say is that the poise with which Laura Fleischman stepped out into the kitchen for glasses and ice was in its way no less memorable than the relaxed banalities of the astronauts as they first stepped out on the alien surface of the moon . Unlike the day when she had caught me by surprise at Bildabian 's office , this time we had both come prepared with conversation enough to see us through and to spare , but if forewarned is forearmed , it is also foredoomed , or at least foredoomed to stick to your conversational guns until the last round you have come grimly supplied with has been fired . Her job with Bildabian , and her plans for the future ; her sick aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in track that spring , the wet weather . Salvo after salvo , we shot them all off , each from his own emplacement , until I despaired more and more of the moment 's ever coming when like opposing troops on Christmas eve we could crawl out and meet like brothers in the no man'sp167land between . I sat on the couch with my feet on the coffee table . Laura sat across from me on a leatherette ottoman with her bare arms and shoulders tanned by some burst of sunlight that must have happened that week while I was looking in the other direction . Facing us was the Barcalounger of Mrs. Fleischman and the tinted likeness of Mr. Fleischman from the shelf with the condensed books . She was thinking of leaving Bildabian , she said , because there were things about the job she did n't like , then maybe moving in with a friend in New York and trying to find a new job there . I said I thought Sutton stacked up pretty well in racing but did n't stand a chance in the javelin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of changes at school since her day , but there were most of the same old faces on the faculty . I had two scotches to her one , but each swallow left me only soberer than before to the point where my despair was so great by the time she got up to go check on supper that I asked if there was a john I could use less because I needed to use it than because , like getting up and walking around the card table , I thought the move might change our luck . It was upstairs , she said . The second door I came to . I opened the first door I came to instead and found myself in her room . Blue night was what my son Bill called twilight in those days , and blue night lay light as snow on the ruffled tester of the four-poster bed and the white nurse 's uniform on a hanger hooked over the closet door . A muslin curtain floated out on the damp air , and on the wall near me hung a photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses , with a slip of Palm Sunday palm tucked in behind thep168frame . The bed was opened with her nightdress laid out over the foot . There was a desk in the corner and on the desk a copy of her class yearbook . I had brought my glass of Dewar 's with me , and setting it down on the desk , I turned on the lamp and took the yearbook up in my hands . Downstairs I could hear the sound of the ice box being opened and shut , the click of china , and I thought of how the labor of our conversation-making must have left her as tired and sad as it had left me , and of how once we had eaten our supper and I had stayed out my time and gone home , this was the room that she would come home to . I pictured her reaching up into the nightdressshe had laid out for herself like her own nurse , pictured her reading herself to sleep in that cool bed . Like a child on his way to the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would also be , if not safe in my own bed because maybe there is no place on earth less safe , at least reprieved in it for a while as I looked back through closed eyes on the failure of our evening together . I opened the year-book at the page that was marked , and on that page there was a picture of myself frowning into the sun in my baggy sweat suit complete with clipboardand stopwatch . Marking the page there were two things  --  a red plastic muddler from the Grand Central bar where we had once met by accident and a note I had apparently written from France , some five years before . It said , Dear Laura , Congratulations two weeks late on your 18th birthday . 18 is a good age to be as ages go , and I hope you will hang on to it as long as you can . I read your letter at an inn where they say Sir Francis Drake got word that the Armada had been sightedp169off Land 's End , and a theosophist who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you tell me a room that is n't ? I am writing this from a hotel in Paris where the armada of traffic under our window all night makes such a racket that it 's like sleeping in the Lincoln Tunnel . The only ghost that 's with me at the moment is yours . I can see you sitting at the back of the classroom in your usual seat trying like a waiter not to catch my eye for fear you 'll be the one I call on if you do . I should be haunted by ghosts like that more often . I 'm sorry to hear about you and Carl West , but I 'm glad you 're taking it philosophically if not theosophically . Never mind , someday all in green your love will come riding , and in the meantime thanks f or your letter and think kindly once in a while of your old English teacher and friend , Antonio Parr . That cumbersomely avuncular note enshrined there like a piece of the true cross  --  I replaced it with the muddler between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs when I found Laura Fleischmanstanding at the door . " So now you know , " I said . " I 'm one of God 's spies . " " I told you we all had a crush on you , " she said . " Every paper you ever wrote a comment on I kept put away somewhere . You must think I 'm an awful fool . " I said , " The fool that wrote that letter was an awful fool . I do n't even remember writing it , if that 's any excuse . " " I remember getting it , " she said . " I bet I read it fifty times the day it came . " I said , " Maybe it starts to grow on you after a while . "  | " Anyway , " she said , " supper 's ready . I was afraid you 'd given up hope , " and I said , " Everything but , " and switched off the lamp on the desk so that the room turned into blue night again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm with a person like you , talking a blue streak about a lot of stuff I 'm not even all that interested in myself . Maybe it 's my job that 's made me such a chatterbox . When you 've got your hand in somebody 's mouth , the only one that 's left to do the talking is you . " We were both standing together in the doorway now , and as she turned around to go , I put my hands on her shoulders and turned her back again , and that was how we finally met face to face in no man 's land . The Chinese Emperor places the spray of forsythia in a glass of stale water threaded with bubbles while full of tubes and needles the sister of Mrs. Fleischman dreams of walking along a beach at low tide . Sharon slides a five dollar bill through the window , and a pair of tickets leap up at her like tongues , a pink for her , a green for Bill . Billie Kling places the thumb and forefinger of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of somebody making a transatlantic phone call tells him he has nothing to fear but fear itself . Alexander Hall is dark and empty , and under one of the pews a single potato chip lies like an autumn leaf . The mystery of things . " And what more shall I say , " wrote Saint Paul in a passage that I heard Bebb hold forth on more than once . " For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak , of Samson and Jephtha , of David also and Samuel and the prophets . These all died in faith , not having received the promises but having seen them afar off , confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth . " Ip171put my hands on the shoulders of Laura Fleischman , and in that room with the curtains afloat and the blue night deepening , one thing led to another thing until at the end of all the things that happened , I received the promise , received from that twenty-two year old girl what would have stopped David himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shaggy jaws . The girls in their long dresses waited with their backs to the wall . The white tester trembled above us like a coif . The headlights of cars drifted slowly across the ceiling . To the consternation of Samson , there came a point where I was afraid my rod and my staff would fail me and I would have to be content like the rest of them with having only seen that promising land I could not enter . It nearly came to that , I do n't know why  --  less the scotch , I think , than my sense of history  --  but in the end it did n't . I was spared that lesser , fleshly failure for the sake of a ghostlier and greater , which is to say that I made my entrance straight and tall only to find that even then I was still afar off , a stranger and a pilgrim to that fragrant earth . I remember lifting her hair , weightless , in my hand and finding that it weighed about what blue night does or rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make nonsense of opposites like soft and hard , chill and warm , swift and slow ; it is no longer either-or but bothand , each a pair of ways to speak a single truth . Desire and despair . I remember that after a while we slept for a little with only a fringe of light from the hall to cover us , and when I woke , she was asleep beside me like a pool of shadows except where the light made her islands in a pool , and I was all gooseflesh in the cool air , trying to withdraw top172some deep place inside my skin , or to the warm places where our skin touched , to keep from shivering her awake . She was asleep with one arm unfolded across me , and I thought of all those months I had watched her at the back of my classroom , that girl who from the highest flight of her beauty could go nowhere , I thought then , but away from it , away from me , but who lay there asleep now at my side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sherbet melting into the fruit salad . I dreaded the moment she would open her eyes and I would have to say something , pick up somehow and go home when I had no home to go home to and knew she was not my home either any more than I was hers as she was bound to know too as soon as she opened her eyes , if she did n't know it already . Only she did n't open her eyes . She spoke with them closed so that for all I knew she 'd been awake the whole time too . She said , " We used to have a bet to see which of us would be the first to kiss you , and Lois Kinney almost won . You were leaning over to correct her paper once , and she said she came so close to it she almost died , only at the last moment she chickened out . You probably did n't even know . " She said , " You do n't have to worry this was my first time or anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to , but he wanted to so much I let him . That time you and I met at the station , I knew the moment you touched my hand that I would with you too , if you asked me to . Afterwards I used to think about it going to sleep at night , thousands of times . I 'd think where we 'd have gone together and how it all would have happened . I knew it was bound to happen someday just the way I always dreamed it would . "  |p173With  her eyes still closed and her words more breath than sound in the hollow at the base of my throat , she said , " I just want you to know I wanted it to happen , and I 'm glad it happened the way it did , and I do n't want you to worry about anything because it was the way I wanted it . " I tried to say something , but I was stuttering with cold by then , Stephen Kulak , and it was like every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridegroom on his wedding night because I rolled over on my side to face her closed eyes then and ran my hand down between her shoulder blades and the length of her spine to her cold little tail for all the world as though no one had ever explained to me that there was any more to it than that , and when to my slapstick dismay I found myself rising again to the very occasion I had every cause to shrink from , time again would fail me to tell of the sadness and loneliness of my pilgrimage . To make love with so nearly a stranger usually fans the spark of an old lecher 's heart , but to make love when he is himself the stranger is to turn the heart to stone . This time we both fell asleep , and when I woke again , it was daylight , and Laura Fleischman was gone . When I went downstairs , I found her in the kitchen making breakfast . She had on her nurse 's uniform with her hair brushed back into the silver barette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair in my eyes . I said , " The man who came to dinner , " and she said , " I had to throw the dinner out . It was n't much anyway . " She said , " I was just about to come up and wake you . I knew you would n't want to be late for school , " and Ip174wondered if that was really what she had been about to do and how she would have gone about doing it and how things might have turned out differently for us both if she had . In her place , I would probably have sneaked out the back door with as little noise as possible . She was standing at the counter in her white dress , her white stockings and shoes , pouring milk into a pitcher like a girl in a Vermeer , and I said , " What time are you supposed to be at Bildabian 's ? " " I 'm supposed to be there like about ten minutes ago , " she said with her back to me still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment girl 's sure to be there first . I do n't like being there alone with him . " " Is he after you ? " I said . She said , " That 's why I 'm quitting , " and as she turned toward me with the pitcher in her hand  --  frowning at the thought of Bildabian 's toothy advances , I suppose , of quitting her job and moving to New York  --  for a momentit was no longer she in one place and I in another place and the emptiness between us a place that was n't home for either of us , but both of us were together in the same place , and it was a place I was afraid I might be homesick for for the rest of my life if I had to leave it now . As she came toward me frowning that way with her eyes lowered , I was for a moment her teacher again and she was my student , and within the protection of that old relationship I felt secure enough to face the possibility that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . But only for a moment , because as she sat down at the table and looked up at me finally as if it was n't the easiest thing she 'd ever done in her life but not the hardest either , she was not my student any more but a girl I hardly knew in a world where there was no protec/tion , and the only way I dared to play it was to play it safe . I said , " Listen , I 'm not Bildabian , but I 'm not Prince Valiant either . I 'm a nice place to visit , but you would n't want to live there . I had a dream at Christmas time that all these years I have n't even known my right name , and even after they told me what it was , I could n't remember it . " She said , " There 's nothing you have to be sorry about . You do n't have to say anything you do n't want . " I sometimes think that all the major dramas of my life have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kitchens there 's always something else to fall back on if the going gets tough , like cooking or eating or doing the dishes . And maybe that 's the real drama after all  --  just keeping yourself alive day after day and cleaning up afterwards . I remember watching Laura Fleischman pour milk out of the pitcher into her dry cereal with the rustle of autumn leaves . I remember sunlight on her bare arm as she reached out for the sugar , and I remember the bitter taste of my coffee . We were keeping alive . I said , " Do me a favor , will you , and be happy for God 's sake ? I mean right now I could list all the happy people I know on the back of a six cent stamp , and I 'm not even sure about them because it takes one to know one . " She looked at her watch and said , " Bildabian 's not going to be happy . I 've got to take off . " So it ended up that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other way round , and there in the hall , with Mrs. Fleischman 's Barcalounger facing us from the living room , what I kissed goodbye was more than just a girl who smelled of breakfast and Ivory soap.  |p176I  read an article in the Times once on the stages that the old go through on their way toward death , and somewhere along the line they apparently go through one called decathexis , which the Times defined as " an emotional detachment from life . " Ordinarily this stage comes on gradually and toward the end of the line , but for me it came rather abruptly and no nearer my end than I was as I stood just inside the Fleischman 's screen door . Having entered such a place as Gideon and the others only dreamed of , I discovered that even there I was a stranger and a pilgrim with years to go ahead of me still and my heart no longer in it . As I kissed Laura Fleischmangoodbye there in the hall , my heart was n't even in the goodbye let alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go that I had n't let go already , and though I suppose that if the loss had n't mattered at all , I would n't have noticed it , all I can say is that it did n't much matter to me that it mattered . With hardly a pang I watched her swing out of the driveway and drive off in the direction of town . Decathexis . After she 'd gone , I went upstairs to get my jacket and tie , and while I was at it , I made the bed too , made crisp hospital corners and smoothed the white spread flat with the palm of my hand . A feather came out of one of the pillows as I plumped it , and before I left , I opened the year book on her desk and laid it between the proper pages . Then I closed the book and went on back to Mrs. Gunther 's to wash up and shave.  |p177AT  BEBB 'S INSISTENCE I went down to Princeton the following Saturday to be on hand for the historic march on Nassau Hall protesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so recently become emotionally detached from things , I went with surprising enthusiasm . To let go of your life does not mean that your life necessarily lets go of you . I 've heard it said that in great office buildings even after the boss has gone home and the doors have been locked behind him , the self-service elevators continue to work off the uncompleted calls of the day , those empty cars moving relentlessly from floor to floor for hours afterwards . Sharon and Laura Fleischman , my nephew Tony and my son Bill , not to mentionp178my students and colleagues at Sutton High  --  they all continued to work at me if only in my head , and it was more to elude them for a while than to witness how things were going to turn out for Bebb in Princeton that I set out again on the well beaten track past the great bridge , Grant 's Tomb , the West Side piers , and down under the river through my father 's tunnel . It was the first really lovely day of spring we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . The magnolias were out at Revonoc . The swimming pool was full . A negro with cotton in his nostrils was mowing the lawn , and the house was full of the fragrance of newly cut grass . Gertrude Conover met me in the hall and greeted me with such an unusual air of distraction that I wondered if she had sent her astral body off on an errand somewhere . She said that Bebb had already gone on to Alexander Hall where the marchers were assembling , and if I wanted to be on time , I 'd better hurry . She said , " I do n't need to tell you this is n't the first of his incarnations I 've known , and in every single one of them he 's gotten himself mixed up in something like this . His aura gets bright as a hundred watt bulb , and the rest of us are drawn to it as moths to a flame . That time in Egypt when he was a priest of Ptah , for instance . Do n't think for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the Pharaoh is still paying the price , a man who had every reason to expect that by this time he would have made a nice little advance toward cosmic consciousness . And look at him now . I said , " Where is the Pharaoh now ? " " His name is Callaway , and he is mowing the grass , " she said . " His second wife has left him with seven children to support , all of them under ten . They have a cold-water flat on John Street . "  | " How much does he know about his previous incarnation ? " I said , and it was moments before she seemed to hear my question as she stood there on the black and white tiles like a threatened queen . Finally she said , " All that poor man knows is that he 's been having nosebleeds ever since Leo moved in . He thinks it 's some kind of allergy . Imagine it  --  a man who once held the power of life and death over thousands right in the palm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Leo is going to want this for the march . Do you mind taking it to him ? " It was Bebb 's maroon preaching robe which lay draped over the bannister , and by the time she 'd picked it up and handed it to me , I think she 'd forgotten why . Bebb was delighted to get it . I found him  --  that hundred watt bulb and scourge of Pharaohs  --  standing in the midst of some hundred or so followers who were milling around in front of the glassed-in Romanesque entrance to Alexander Hall . His bald head was pearled with sweat in the spring sun . He had on the kind of dark glasses that you can see through only from the inside . He was in his shirtsleeves and pale with excitement as he threw his arms around me and hugged me to him . It was the first and last time he ever hugged me to him . He said , " Antonio , this is the day that the Lord hath made . Let 's you and I rejoice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped him into his robe and he stood there larger than life in the red of martyrdom with mirrors for eyes , he could have been the god Ptah himself . In describing the great march and everything it precipitatedfor Bebb and all of us , I lean heavily on a special issue of the Daily Princetonian which wasp180brought out the next day under the banner headline BEBB EMBATTLED : THE FALL OF THE HALL . For all his excessively alliterative and telegraphic journalese , the undergraduate reporter did his homework thoroughly and supplied a wealth of detail including the ipsissima verba of various eyewitnesses which help convey the overall sweep of the thing better than I could , who was caught up in my own particular backwash . Backwash is the word . Two cups of coffee have always had the effect on me of two quarts of beer , and having foolishly not taken time to relieve myself after leaving Sutton that morning , I was so preoccupied with my own inner distressthat everything I saw was colored by it . I suppose a man 's view of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaudy events of the day primarily in terms of the occasion they might or might not offer for satisfying my homely need , the undergraduate reporter seems to have seen them in terms of conspiracy . Whereas what I saw behind every tree was a potential haven for myself , what he saw was new evidence that Bebb had planned everything out with extraordinary foresight and cunning . I do n't think this view is correct . I think many of the things that happened happened by chance . But who knows ? Maybe right from the first day I ever laid eyes on him , Bebb was more cunning than I ever gave him credit for . Or maybe Gertrude Conover 's theosophic dictum is right and there is no such thing as chance anyway . Be that as it may , the Prince begins with a verbatim transcript of Bebb 's address to his followers before the march began as Nancy Oglethorpe captured it on her tape recorder , holding the small black microphone up at him like an enema tube . They had all gathered onp181the blacktop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bedsheetslettered with slogans like Love is a Feast and Tell Your Troubles to Jesus , Ban the Bomb not Bebb and Nassau Hall Go Home . There was a Campus Cop named McCartney on duty in his little kiosk right in the midst of them , but he gave no sign of being particularly disturbed by what was going on all around him , and there seemed to be no reason why he should have been . In their jeans and bell-bottoms , their shorts and bare feet , they looked no more menacing than the usual bunch you might find queued up at the movies any night of the week . There was n't so much as a water pistol in sight , and such shenanigans as there were could hardly have been more pastoral and innocent . Some flower children presented Officer McCartney with a daisy chain , and a black track star scaled one of the squat turrets to scatter a bag or two of paper rosepetals , and that was about the length of it . Officer McCartney apparently phoned in a routine report just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even bother to investigate . " In Nassau Hall business went on as usual , " as the Prince put it . " President 's secretary typing out honorary degree citations . In University Chapel choir rehearses Also hat Gott die Welt Geliebt for Sunday service . Dean Borden is home sprucing up for alumni dinner in Allentown , Pa . Rainbow colored Frisbies tossed among sun worshipers in nearby Holder court . " It was somewhere around eleven when Bebb finally mounted a green wooden bench and delivered his marchingorders . He took his text not from Scripture for once but from the annals of the American Revolution . He said , " It 's going on two hundred years since Generalp182George Washington struck a great blow for liberty right here in Princeton , New Jersey , and today we 're going to follow in his footsteps and strike us another one . You and me , we 're going to march on Nassau Hall and ask for the liberty to keep on having our Love Feasts here in Alexander Hall where we 've been having them right along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got a petition in my hand signed with near on to three hundredJohn Hancocks , and I 'm fixing to put it personally right into the hand of the President himself . Folks , we 're not asking for the moon . All we 're pushing for is the liberty to keep on saving souls on this historic campus just like they 're supposed to be saving them over there to the University Chapel . " Bebb launched forth then into a rather rambling account of the Battle of Princeton and the events leading up to it . He told how Washington had first struck at Trenton while the Heinies were still hungover from Christmas , and how he had taken it as easy as taking crackers off a shelf . he told how then the British in their fancy red jackets and tight pants had hotfooted it down from Princeton to win it back the next morning and how Washington had outfoxed them by marching around their lines under cover of darkness and striking at Princetonthe next day while it was virtually undefended . According to Virgil Roebuck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this section of the speech that Bebb had tipped his hand as to the foxiness he had in mind himself . " You got to hand it to that mother , " Roebuck was quoted as saying . " He as good as gave the whole show away when he told about the Princeton campaign , but who the hell learns anything from history ? " I 'm not sure about that . As things turned out , it isp183undeniably true that Bebb employed some of the same tactics as his famous predecessor , but it is hard for me to believe that he was playing cat and mouse in his oration . If he was tipping his hand , I do n't think he knew that he was . If he was making any comparisons , I do n't think it was a comparison of tactics with tactics but of himself with Washington  --  both of them down on their luck , beleaguered , up against terrible odds . I remember the emotion in his voice as he stood there with the sweat running down and describing how Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refrigerators on every side , " how he resisted all temptation to " throw in the jock and head back for Virginia where the future First Lady of the land was waiting to welcome him with open arms . " Then " Boys , " he said . " Boys , we got the Father of our Country on our side and we got our Father who art in Heaven on our side too , and that 's a hard combination to beat . Let 's move off to Nassau Hall for Jesus . " So Jesus , God , General Washington , and maybe the Sphinx too if he remembered Gertrude Conover 's theory that the Sphinx was only the General in an earlier avatar  --  I believe it was they , rather than any elaborate strategem , that filled Bebb 's heart as he led his followers forward , with me and my distended bladder keeping up as best we could . From Alexander Hall to Nassau Hall is no distance at all if you take the direct route , but in order I suppose to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We headed toward Witherspoon first , and from Witherspoon off toward the Blair arch where with our shoe leather clattering like applause down the enormousflight of stone steps we descended into the lower campus . The marchers must have numbered well overp184one hundred and fifty by then , and needless to say they attracted a good deal of attention as they snaked slowly along with their hymns and placards . Faces appeared in dormitory windows , and bodies choked the entryways . Sunbathers abandoned their transistors and six-packs to fall in behind . Passers-by stopped dead in their tracks , and some of them fell in behind too . Bright as a Kentuckyredbird against the grey Gothic stone , Bebb strode along at the head of the long procession like a visiting head of state , but he kept breaking ranks to shake hands and exchange pleasantries with the onlookers , then hoisting his skirts to catch up again at his fat man 's lightfoottrot . The column was stretched out at such length that sometimes a hymn would rise up from one segment of it and something like Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nancy Oglethorpe and her aides kept fanning out to distribute flyers that showed a mug shot of Bebb with the astonished stare of a man shot out of a cannon  --  above him WANTED , below him FOR BRINGING THE GOSPEL TO GOMORRAH . All of this in the loveliest spring imaginable with only a few clouds gathering on the horizon , a kind of children 's crusade with Bebb as Peter the Hermit or an overstuffed Pied Piper . Ambushed by Atheists was the subhead under which the Prince reporter described the single untoward incidentthat marred the otherwise leisurely , picnic air of it all , the only foreshadowing of trouble to come , and the way it happened was this . The marchers wound their way around past the lower battlements of the gym , then up the sloping road that leads back to the heart of the campus again where it turns sharp right past those twin Greek temples , Whig and Clio , and on toward thep185library and the Chapel . The rear of Nassau Hall loomed up on our left like the Promised Land , massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but Bebb 's idea was to make his grand entrance at the front instead so we continued on past it until we reached Murray Dodge , and it was there that the incident took place . An undergraduate group that called itself Atheists for Democratic Action had set up a roadblock . There must have been fifteen or twenty of them all told . Some of them were holding up a huge placard that showed a caricature of Bebb as a fat convict in prison stripes with a halo over his head and the legend Back Behind Bars with Bebb . Others had stretched an American flag out across the road where the parade had to pass with an atheist at each corner to hold it down and several others armed with cameras to record the desecration in case Bebb chose to lead the faithful over it . The procession came to a halt . There was a certain amount of catcalling back and forth . The atheists set off some firecrackers when Nancy Oglethorpe tried to approach them with a handful of flyers . Bebb walked forward with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the processionhad crowded forward to see what was going on , several of them got their hands on the flag , and the next thing I knew , a scuffle had broken out . It never turned into a free-for-all luckily  --  the action was pretty much limited to where the flag was  --  but both Bebb and Nancy Oglethorpe were caught up in it . Neither of them actually gave battle as far as I could tell , but I could see their heads bobbing around in a sea of heaving shoulders and flying elbows . I remember Bebb 's flushed and desperate face , his robe pulled half off onep186shoulder , and I wondered if like Washington he was tempted to give the whole business up and go home to the open arms of Gertrude Conover and the peaceful terrace of Revonoc . But " I am a church " he had said that dreary time in my bedroom at Mrs. Gunther 's , and I suppose that meant to him that you took things as they came whether they were the ravening lions of martyrdomor this sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoot in hell whether the church stood or fell flat on its face . Anyway it did n't last long . The Atheists for Democratic Action were vastly outnumbered . The Love Feasters captured the flag , and the next time I saw it , Nancy Oglethorpe had it draped around her shoulders like a beach towel . With her beehive in tatters and her face streaked like a Comanche'swith her melting pancake , she started the march going again . It was at this point that , unable to contain myself any longer , I ducked into Murray Dodge to find a can , and by the time I came out again , hystericalwith relief , the mob had disappeared around the far end of Nassau Hall to take up their vigil out front . There must have been close to three hundred of them by then gathered out under the regal elms . The atheists had joined them and so had brunchers from the Student Center and scholars from the Firestone stacks . Shoppers had drifted in off Nassau Street and so had a flock of Lawrenceville seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls had commandeered a sprinkler and were horsing around with it by the Dean 's house , but most of them had crowded around the steps of the main entrance , a few sitting astride the bronze lions that stood guard there . Bebb had already entered the building with a few of his principal lieutenants to present theirp187petition to the President , and Nancy Oglethorpe , still swathed in the Stars and Stripes , was trying her best to lead a pray-in outside while the rest of us waited for Bebb to reemerge and announce the outcome . If anything substantiates Roebuck 's theory that like Washington in 1777 Bebb had his whole stratagem planned out well in advance , it was the events of the next half hour or so , and since like everybody else I spent that time waiting under the tall elms , I must rely entirelyon the researches of the Prince for what took place behind the scenes . The first thing that took place was that the Proctors ' Office received an anonymous phone call to the effect that if Bebb was thwarted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , or if the petition was turned down flat , his followers were planning to enter Nassau Hall by force if necessary and stage a sit-in in all the major administrative offices . Whether this actually was the plan or , if not , whether Bebb wanted the authoritiesto think that it was and thus to that end contrived the anonymous phone call himself , remains among the hidden things of history , but in any case , whoever baited the hook , the Proctors ' Office lost no time in snapping at it . Within minutes all the proctors and Campus Cops that could be contacted were ordered to take up battle stations at Nassau Hall including , significantly , Officer McCartney , who left his post at the kiosk by Alexander Hall and proceeded to join the rest of his colleagues on the double . While this maneuver was going on , inside Nassau Hall Bebb and his deputation made their way to the President'soffice where they were received by a secretary who said that the President was in an important conferencep188and asked them to take seats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously could n't have planned , and thus it seems to me to knock at least a small hole in Roebuck 's theory . The next step , however , is something else again . Instead of waiting in the President 's outer office with the rest of them , Bebb asked the way to the washroom and left . Alerted by the proctors to expect a possible sit-in , most of the office staff had closed and locked their doors , and for that reason the Prince was unable to locate anybody who actually saw what Bebb did next . That he went to the washroom is attested to by the discovery there later of a sheaf of flyers left on the edge of a washbasin , but how he proceeded from there is anybody'sguess . It hardly matters . Somehow  --  either by one of the side doors or possibly , I like to think , through a ground floor window  --  he managed to leave the building undetected , and while everybody including by then the entire security force of Princeton University was waiting for him to appear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead to Alexander Hall where Officer McCartney 's kiosk stood empty except , reported the Prince , for a well-thumbed copy of Penthouse and a halfeatenswiss-on-rye . If Bebb 's followers had founded a new religion in his name , I suppose they would have started their calendar with the Year One as the year of this historic flight , this hegira that Bebb made unseen by human eyes from the one great hall to the other . Officer McCartney was not there to greet him , but others were . Gertrude Conover was there for one . She had arrived in her low-slung Continental driven by her black gardener Callaway . En route to the U Store with a malfunctioning typewriter , an undergraduate namedp189Max Bridenbaugh happened to be there also , and Bridenbaugh was the Prince 's source for all this . A handful of Love Feasters who had not been along on the grand march had gained entrance to Alexander , and as soon as Gertrude Conover 's Continental drew up , they ran out to help Callaway unload . According to Bridenbaughthe back seat was piled high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips , paper plates , paper cups , and a huge silver punchbowl bearing the Conover arms . All of this was rushed into the building , and Bebb and Gertrude Conover and the handful of Love Feasters followed , locking the glass doors behind them . Holding his blood-stained handkerchief to his nose , Callaway revved up the Continental , parked it near the entrance to Holder , and left the campus on the run . Max Bridenbaugh shoved his broken typewriter into the abandonedkiosk just in time to prevent its being trampled to pieces by the hordes that almost immediately started streaming in from Nassau Hall , myself among them . Bridenbaugh , whose opinion as chairman of the Ivy bicker committee was given considerable weight by the Prince , stated that the whole operation was carried out in a way that suggested split second timing and a degree of coordinationthat bordered on the supernatural . There was something aquarium-like about the scene that followed with those few pale faces floating dim and ghostly on the inside of the glassed-in rotunda and everybodyelse on the outside . The proctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd to disperse and threatening disciplinary action if it did n't . There were more older faces mixed in with the others now . Exceptfor Virgil Roebuck , who had arrived with his son in a wheel chair that looked several sizes too big for him , Ip190did n't recognize many of them , but the Prince identified such notables as Stanislaus Fuchs , the Nobel laureate in physics , and James Ingram , that year 's poet-in-residence . Somebody told me that the enormous man in the white beard and pith helmet was Dean Emeritus Nelson Higby Ackroyd . The Love is a Feast and Ban the Bomb not Bebb posters were as much in evidence as ever and the hymns kept coming , but holy hell had all but swallowed up what little was left of a holy cause when word flashed around that Dean Borden had arrived , and the crowd divided like the Red Sea to let him through . It was one of the great encounters surely  --  on one side of the glass Dean Broadus Borden , Philadelphia-born former Rhodes Scholar and holder of honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pearl grey dacron and regimental stripes , and on the other side of the glass Leo Bebb , sweat-stained and grim with his trick eyelid doing its trick like a broken window shade . They made a brief attempt to communicate through the dusty panes like a Head Curator and a blowfish , but when this failed , Bebb gave the word and one door was unbarredjust wide enough for the Dean to squeeze through sideways , scraping his glasses off in the process . In a few minutes the door opened and the Dean came out again with one lens missing , the other cracked , and Bebb came with him . Like Eisenhower at a fund rally , the Dean held his arms up high above his head , the mob fell silent , and into that silence he dropped the terms that he and Bebb had agreed upon . The marchers were to be permitted to enter Alexander in an orderly fashion to conduct their feast , and in return Bebb guaranteedthat afterwards they would disband peaceablyp191and abide by whatever decision the President reached on their further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Bebb a symbolic handshake , and as though in token of divine endorsement , there was a clap of thunder , and the rain started coming down in sheets as the two lords , spiritual and temporal , retreated into the Hall with the nimbleness of vaudeville hoofers to avoid being crushed to death by the advancing horde . There was a rumor that the Tropicanas that were served inside were spiked with something stronger than the customary white wine , and an unidentified freshman was quoted as saying , " Man , like that stuff was a real bomb , " but in her own interview with the Prince , Gertrude Conover denied this . She said , " It is a scientific fact that matter can be converted into energy . It is a spiritual fact that energy can be converted into matter . It was the karmic energy of Jesus Christ at the Cana weddingthat turned the water into wine , and I believe that it was the karmic energy of Leo Bebb that had a similar effect on the Tropicana punch . " When they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Boston gin was discovered among the wreckage later , she said simply , " I have already given you my comment . " As for how the last Love Feast unfolded , the Prince account proceeds as follows . Picture Alexander Hall crammed to capacity . Picture J. A. Holzer mosaics of Homer and his Heroes looking down on seething bouillabaise of believers and unbelievers , faculty and undergrads , cops and catechumens .

" So much for the Prince . I stayed on at Revonoc for what was left of that shattered weekend because GertrudeConover asked me to . She took to her bed as soon as she returned from the interrogation at Borough Hall , and I did not see her again before I left , but she wanted me on hand to take care of the telephone and handle the press . Beyond that , her theory was that by remaining under the same roof , our auras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incarnation and provide a kind of beacon light by which Bebb could find his way wherever he was going . As she mounted the stairs to her bedroom , her blue curls hanging limp from the day 's exertions , she paused with her hand on the bannister to explain this to me . Then she said , " Events he did not anticipate have shaken him loose from his karmic field . For the time being the gravitational pull of his destiny has no more effect on him than a magnet on an egg . If we stand by him now , you and I and Callaway , it is just possible that this time Leo Bebb may break free once and for all and rise to cosmic liberation like a balloon . "  |p197BIP  , I said . PRINCETON . TROUBLE . GONE . . . shouting allthe key words so that it was like hearing them for the first time myself , getting my own bad news . I might as well have saved the cost of the call for all Sharon could hear over the terrible connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual post under Mrs. Gunther 's stairs . But she got the gist of it well enough , her voice crackling back at me like the sound track of an old movie : Jesus . That Bip . Hand . You had to hand it to him ? Home . It was like one of Bebb 's free association sermons . Bill . Bus . There was a thunderstorm blowing across from the gulf , she said . I could almost hear the palmettos and cabbage palms rattling , the lions withp198their backs to the rain by the riffled pool as the lightning clove our talk in two . She would come . I would meet her . Then I miss you , I said . MISS You . Afraid she 'd be struck , she hung up as I was saying it , the blips and pizzicati of connections being disconnected becoming the small Bronx cheer of the dial tone so that again my message ended up being for me . I missed her . I did what I could to get the house ready for my wife and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I waded through the importunities of congressmen and missionaries , catalogues full of nose hair clippers , early American fondue forks and personalized pencils . Ice had gotten in under the flashing during the winter , and there was a damp stain on the dining room wall as though a firing squad had finished off the Czar and his family there . A pot of petrified Cream of Wheat stood in the kitchen sink . Nobody had bothered to take out the Christmas tree , and I found it in the living room , a ragged brown scarecrow in a pool of needles . I opened some windows and picked up the mail . I plugged in the refrigerator and filled the trays . I ran water into the Cream of Wheat and left it to soak . Before I was through , there was n't a room I did n't enter , not a door I did n't push open half expecting to find something mouldering in a corner behind it . When I opened the door of the little attic room where Bebb had lived , I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a pool of dead flies , as sere and pillaged as the Christmas tree . The room was empty . In Sharon 's and my room , the bed was unmade , last slept in , I suppose , the New Year 's Eve when she had gotten sick and Tony had stayed to comfort her.  |p199More  even than to keep the weather out , the purpose of a house is to keep emptiness out , I thought  --  to box ourselves off from a sky that is too spacious , a horizon too far-flung , to carpenter for ourselves a space we can handle and feel at home in . But something had gone wrong . Instead of boxing emptiness out , those abandonedrooms had somehow boxed it in , emptiness not as an absence but as a presence : our house so filled with emptiness that it was hard to imagine there ever being room again for anything else . Later that day I drove to Stamford to meet them , and I can see them still as they got out of the bus , Sharon carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip and Bill in a straw hat with an alligator on it . Spottingthem before they spotted me , I saw for a moment how they looked when they did n't have me around to look at , how they must have looked all those weeks without me in Armadillo or would have looked if I 'd been lying in my grave instead of standing there by a cigarette machine watching them without their knowing it . Sharon had her hands under Bill 's arms to lift him down from the bus steps , and it must have tickled him the way he was cracking up as she swung him down to the street . That was how they looked , and having seen it , I found myself not wanting to see any more , shifting my position so that the cigarette machine stood between us . Maybe it was a clue to the standoffishness of the dead when you run into them in dreams . It 's not because they do n't love you any more that they keep their distance but because they have their business to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe that 's just as well for you both . When I kissed Sharon , she kept hold of me with her cheek pressed against mine just long enough to make mep200wonder why , but it turned out to be only because her gold hoop earring had gotten snagged on my jacket , and having that to fuss about was as good a way to get through the moment as any . Bill gave me a wet smacker on the chin and handed me something done up in a Kleenex and a rubber band . It was a sand dollar . " Hey , Antonio , " Sharon said . There was no lack of conversation on the drive home . It was as if they had simply been away on a vacation and wanted to catch me up on how things had been with them . From the back seat Bill told about a cat named Shell who went into the closet when you were away and made messes in your shoes . He told about a beach where he 'd worked his treasure finder to locate an oarlock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chuck Warner who had hair in his ears and chewed up live shiners for chum . Sharon said she 'd gotten her old job back part time at the souvenir stand where they sold shrunken heads and carved coconut husks and rugs with sunsets and palm trees on them . She said that a boy she used to know named Jitter Baskin had turned the building where Holy Love used to be into a seafood restaurant and that the house where she had lived with Bebb and Lucille was vacant now and up for sale . She had gotten the key from the real estate agent and taken Bill through it one day  --  Lucille 's TV room out back , the pull-chain john with the varnished brown seat , the gingerbread verandah where Herman Redpath had stood to have his picture taken the day Bebb had ordained him and all hell broke loose . As they chattered on I tried to imagine what it had beenp201like for them ; I tried to get the feel of finding a cat-mess in your shoe or entering again that Charles Addams manse where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in white sailor pants and a raspberry shirt as Bebb had leaned on the horn to hurry her . I tried to hear between the lines as they spoke , to search their words for some clue I could find my way back to them with ; and all the while I was doing it , my son from the seat behind me was exploring me with his hands . He was reaching around and tracing the line of my jaw , my lips , running his fingers against the grain of my beard , and it occurred to me that in his own way he was trying to do the same thing . It was as if he was searching my face for somethingburied there , for secret treasure he maybe even half knew was a clue to the secret of himself as every time I drove through the tunnel where my poor father had told me once to keep a lookout for fish I half knew it was my own secret I was tunneling toward . I thought of all the things I could tell them , when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they were gone . I could tell about puff-puff , how there by the lion 's pool where I had seen Herman Redpath again and Lucille and Miriam , Brownie 's suckling pig had rooted me out , that porcus Dei , dropping into my lap a name that lay deep beneath all my other names , my true and hidden name which I had never since been able either quite to remember or quite to forget . I could tell about Laura Fleischman and how in the blue night I had been granted my heart 's desire only to discover that something less than my heart was in it . More than anything I could explain about decathexis  --  how the habit , I suppose , of keeping too sharp an eye on your own life can precipitate you prematurely into that geriatric statep202where life itself becomes a kind of spectator sport in which there is nothing much left either to win or to lose that greatly matters . Bill with his treasure-seeking hands on my face  --  if anybody was to find there some scrap worth salvaging of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , my child . He owed me that , or I him . I could have told him that too . Instead , I caught one of his fingers between my teeth the next time it came near enough and held him by it for a moment , his alligator hat knocked cockeyed against the back of my head . Then I let him go . " That did n't hurt , " he said , sinking back into his seat , and I said , " That 's what you think . " What I actually did tell them about when my turn came was mostly Bebb 's adventures  --  the march on NassauHall , the final Love Feast , Bebb 's mild and magnificenteye as Roebuck 's boy had staggered those few steps toward him across the stage . It became a kind of comic strip the way I found myself editing it for Bill 's consumption , and I left until some other time the job of filling in for Sharon the little clouds that come puffing out of people 's heads with the light bulbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd eaten the sandwiches I 'd gotten in and put Bill to bed , Sharon stood in the hall for the first time in four months looking up those empty stairs . She said , " I wish I had a dollar for every time I 've dreamed about this place . It 's the same dream every time . I 'm back here again just like now . Everything looks normal as hell . I check it all out . Then the same thing always happens . I open some door or turn a corner , and all of a sudden I 'm looking at a part of the house I never saw before . I think what a queer thing it is that all the years we lived herep203there was this whole bunch of rooms we never used because we did n't even know they were there . " Then " Today it 's like coming home for a funeral , " she said , " only nobody 's died . " I said , " Speak for yourself . " She stood there with one hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unhook her blouse at the top . She said , " Listen , I know there 's a whole mess of things we 've got to hash over , but it seems like we were six months on that Greyhound , and my tail 's dragging . If it 's OK by you , I vote we sack out . We can start out even in the morning . " The business of bags , supper , bedding down Bill had given us a common ground to meet on , but without warning she pulled it out from under us now . She stood with one foot on the bottom stair , her unhooked blouse showing where her tan ended , and I stood under that same hall light where once Tony had hung up his jockstrapwith a pot of African violets in it . It was no longer the last few months we had to contend with suddenly but the next few minutes . What could we do to help Bebb ? Was our marriage washed up permanently ? If so , how about Bill upstairs asleep in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the one she 'd dropped naked and quivering between us . Sack out where became the only question with flesh on its bones  --  she upstairs in our unmade bed and I back at Mrs. Gunther 's or , if I stayed , in Tony 's or Chris 's room or up in Bebb 's attic with the dead flies ? It was left to me to answer somehow , and she did nothing to make it easy , watching me in silence with those somber eyes.  | " It 's OK by me , " I said . " Mind if I stick around and play a few hands of solitaire ? " Then , without warning again , her smile . The secret of most faces is the look they have in repose , turned inward on where the secret is , but with Sharon it was always that minstrel show flash of white teeth that let the cat out of the bag , made anyone she flashed it on a party to the secret of who she was . " Be my guest , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ? Get that tree out of the sitting room . It gives me the creeps . " And piss on the side of the bowl , " she said . So she went upstairs with her brown back showing down to where it was n't brown any more and her long hair streaked by the Armadillo sun and her tail dragging , and I went into the living room to deal with the tree . Every time you touched it , a million more needles fell to sweep up , and I had to unscrew the stand and roll back the carpet , but I got it done eventually and dragged the tree out back to the compost heap . There was a sharp-edged white moon overhead and stars thick and quiet as dust , the silence eternelle that scared hell out of Pascal but to me has always seemed a somehow plumed and floating hush over the scariness of things . Near the compost was that great A-shaped wooden contrivance of knobs and dowels and slotted laths that I had put together during the first years of our marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard . It hung on a rusty chain from its tripod the worse for wear and weathered silver , broken here and there by the weight of snow , the kids who sometimes came and fooled with it . I gave it a little shove with my foot and watched it as with a gallows creak it turned ponderouslyp205in the moonlight , the slow passing behind one another of its parts giving it the look of movement within movement . I thought of the Hayden Planetarium where Miriam and I had been taken as children and of that crouching , two-headed machine that projected the stars onto the domed roof as now it seemed to me this old toy of mine was projecting them in all their colossal pointlessnessand beauty . I stopped it with my foot to make the stars stand still . The light was on in our bedroom . Everything stands still , the old riddle goes , and motionis in the eye of the beholder if it 's anywhere at all . A comic strip , an arrow in flight , a life  --  like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parade of unmoving moments that only seem to move . No matter what happens next , everything that has happened is for keeps . No matter how long Orphan Annie goes on , each frame along the way remains intact . My monument on its chain , for instance . The Christmas tree on the compost heap . I stand beside them to this day wherever else I 've found to stand since . There is a cloud coming out of my head as I stare up at our lighted window , and Sharon is in that cloud . She is looking the way she did the first time we made love together in the Salamander Motel the winter before we were married . She has just come out of the shower , and the towel she had wrapped around her like a sari lies at her feet where it fell when I reached up and touched the tucked-in place at her shoulder . Light comes in through the slats of the Venetian blind . She is wearing only water . In that frame too I stand to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I got upstairs , the light turned off , and talk about your comic strips  --  Daisy Mae lying there on her side as warm and loose as silk beneathp206the moon-drenched sheet while with slapstick caution Li'l Abner climbs in beside her all gooseflesh and stiff as a poker . Frame after frame he lies there not daring so much as to gulp . In bed at night , shadows have a way of turning into substance , thoughts into things you can catch your toe on so that you feel the bed shake as you literally fall asleep when that time comes . My day was drifting back at me as I waited for sleep there  --  the tour of our empty house , the bus , Bill 's hands on my face  --  and the sadness of it got all confused with a dryness in my throat , desire confused with the pillow under my head , something that would n't lie flat . There was a scent of hair-tonic on the pillow  --  Tony 's ?  --  that I kept dimly trying to break like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone . I heard it first as the ripping in two of something with writing on it and reached across Sharon for whatever it was , whatever I was , knocking the receiver off the hook in the dark and feeling her move beneath my arm as I fumbled for it . It was Bebb 's voice I pressed to my ear , Bebb telling me who I was : Antonio ? " That you , Antonio ? Now listen real close . I got to talk fast . " He said , " The hour is at hand , Antonio . The powers of darkness are on the march , and time 's running out . Here 's what I want you to do . I 'm in New York City , never mind where for now . There 's things better not said over the wire . " He said , " There 's a place in the park where they serve sandwiches and soda pop under beach umbrellas . It 's down a flight of stone steps . There 's a pond at the bottom has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? "  |p207When  I told him I knew it , he said , " If you can make it round four P.M. tomorrow , do n't be surprised to find a certain person there can guide you to me . Can you make it , Antonio , Sharon and you both ? " I did n't ask him how he knew Sharon was back or if he knew also that at that moment I was leaning across her to get at the phone . I told him just that we would make it , and his relief was audible . I pictured him squeezed into a streetcorner booth somewhere with his black raincoatbuttoned to the chin and the brim of his Tyrolean hat pulled down . He said , " Meantime you tell Sharon Bip said not to worry about anything . Tell her we all of us just got to hold tight to Jesus . " Somebody else evidently said something to him then , and he must have covered the receiver with his hand as he turned to answer . All I could hear was a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Bebb laugh before , and the incongruity of it stayed in my ears long after the harried tone of the rest had faded . That hushed and conspiratorial s.o.s. and then that solitary , fat man 's laugh so rich and abandoned . It was as if beneath the secret of his whereabouts lay a deeper secret still which only by accident I had heard an echo of . Then all was gravity again as he came back . " Hold tight to Jesus , " he said , " because he 's the only one there is wo n't never let you down . " Then " Tomorrowfour o'clock , Antonio . Meantime do n't take any wooden nickles , " and he hung up . " It was Bip , " I told Sharon . " He says we 've got to hold tight to Jesus . " " Jesus who ? " she said . I had started to roll back to my side of the bed and tellp208her the rest of what he 'd said when she slipped one arm around my waist . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . " Sex education is known as Human Relations at Sutton High , and among those of us who are pressed into teachingit each year to small , glassy-eyed groups of freshmen and sophomores , the party line is that sex for sex 's sake is at its best not much . If only your bodies meet and the human beings that happen to inhabit them do n't , the chances are you 'll only compound the problem you shacked up together to solve . It 's not a bad rule of thumb as rules of thumb go , and by and large I 'm willing to stand by it myself . But there are exceptions . I did n't have the faintest idea who was inhabiting Sharon 's body that first night she got back . The very familiarity of her outer presence beside me there only deepened the inner mystery , and she had no reason to be any better informed about me . So it was only our bodies that met that night , those two old reactionaries going off half-cocked as usual , and by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except that it did . I suppose you could n't say we made love together , being in inward ways too far apart for that , but at least we made a kind of stopgap peace together . Human relations notwithstanding , even the flesh has its own cloddish wisdom . When we were through , I remember she said , " That one was on Bip , " and when I told her about his smotheredlaugh , she said , " You never can tell about Bip . Maybe that 's what he woke us up for . "  |p209THE  RAIN HAD DWINDLED to a fine grey mist by the time Sharon and I arrived at the Bethesda Fountain in CentralPark . The place was nearly deserted , the umbrellas taken in . Only one of the tables was occupied . There were two middle-aged Japanese sitting at it . One of them looked as though he might have been part of a U.N . delegation . He had on a Humphrey Bogart trench coat and a tweed golf cap with the visor unsnapped . The other was plumper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small , peaked roof . They were sitting side by side facing out across the water . They both wore glasses and seemed to have their eyes closed . The terrace was littered with shallow puddles ,  |p210and  under one of the empty chairs a few pigeons pecked half-heartedly for crumbs . The whole scene had an oriental feeling  --  only the tops of the tall buildings visiblein the distance , the two old friends , the single grey of water and sky . The only spot of color was the yellow plastic rain hat Sharon wore . ' We stood just inside the arch that the wide stairs descended through . From the refreshment booth farther back under the arch a scent of coffee floated out into the damp city air . On the chance that one of the two Japanese was Bebb 's emissary , we walked to the edge of the basin where they could see us . Neither of them seemed to notice . On the fountain , the angel was striding forward in a purposeful way with his head bowed . One hand was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing , the other extended out over the pool . A pigeon sat on one of the angel 's outstretched wings , and under his stone hand the water lay flat and still . A paper plate floated upside down , an unfurled rubber filmy and vague as a dead fish . Sharon said , " You sure he said four ? It 's nearly half past . " A young couple appeared down the stairs and stood in the archway looking out in our direction . The girl had a Bonwit 's shopping bag and the boy a camera strung around his neck . There was something foolish and abandonedabout them , like actors taking their bows to an empty house . After a while they came out and sat down at one of the tables . Sharon said , " Maybe it 's some kind of trap . " She had picked me up after my last class and driven me straight to the train where we could n't find seats together , then the quick dash from Grand Central to thep211park so we 'd hardly had the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dare exchange more than a few at a time now for fear of missing what we 'd come for . " Maybe , " I said , " only I 've had a queer feeling right along there 's been nobody following us . " The boy got up from the table and came over . He said , " Sir , I wonder if you 'd mind doing us a favor and taking a picture . You 've just got to line us up in the window and push that jigger down . " " Honeymooners ? " Sharon said . The boy said , " I guess you could call it that . " He went back to the table and sat down , and I crouched to my heels on the wet terrace in front of them moving the camera around to get the background right . What followed was pure Alfred Hitchcock  --  the missing finger on the stranger 's hand , the old lady turning around and not being Dame May Whitty . Beyond the lovers ' heads , standing on the balustrade above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wearing a green rubber raincoat that almost touched the ground and a porkpie hat . I could n't make out his face very well , but I did n't need to . That great heap of a body lumping out in the wrong places as though it was several people gotten up to look like one , that scrawny neck  --  there was no mistaking him . It was Mr. Golden . He raised one arm and with a single backward sweep motionedus to follow him . By the time we made it up the stairs , he had crossed the road and traveled a surprising distance away from us through the wet grass . The way the raincoat hid his legs , he never seemed to be running , but we had to rush to keep from losing sight of him in the mist . He did n't **31;822;TOOLONG . She had a disposition as soft as the down on angels ' wings . She was from Texas , but that was an accident of birth , and even so it was n't all bad because , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as Nick was concerned , that was all anybody needed to know about anybody . Find out who her mother 's aunt was , and the first thing you know , you discover you are sleeping with the sister of a first cousin of yours . Besides , marginal information about anybody merely reduced to the least the ecstasy of concentration upon the center of the warm sun . Yvette felt the same way . He was just another oil man , and she collected oil men . She liked the way he looked and tasted , she figured he was not from Texas , because he talked like a Yankee . That 's all she wanted to know . It was gratifying to wallow in the generous gifts of pleasure of a woman like Yvette and know that she was giving because she wished to , not because it made her a peripheral part of history to screw the half brother of the late , great Timothy Kegan , once President of the United States . Yvette Malone lived an idyllic life anywhere it was the comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat house on the Avenue de la Bourdonnais ( on the right side of that privileged street ) , and she was willing to fly anywhere except Texas . She insisted on screwing on an " exchange of presents " basis . She always gave Nick gaudy underwear . He had seventeen sets of silk underwear in five pastel colors . After the first time , when she had explained her policy , he had given her a Hiroshige print . After that she had guided him toward stockings . She said stockings were more impersonal . He did n't think he really understood her , but he liked barter-banging very much . Nick was unmarried ; had never been married . He was forty-one years old . More and more he had been thinking he should marry Yvette Malone . He could n't think of even one small reason against it . They could breed some people to whom he could leave all that underwear . Marriage was a tricky business . When Tim had married Mary Elizabeth McGlade he had certainly neverexpected he would be a widower at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained a widower , because Pa had underlinedthat since the tragedy had happened anyway , and terrible as it was , no one could change it , it should be viewed as a political asset : The Man Who Had Remained True to a Precious Memory . Tim had agreed , partly because he felt that way ( at the time ) , but even more because it meant big action with the hundreds of women who had wanted to console him . Tim had appreciated women because they brought out the actor in him . When he got bored with himself he changed women and got himself a new personality . Except for Pa 's implacable resistance , Tim would have been an actor . Tim had been a wholesomelyvulgar man who had believed in a good mirror when he saw one . Tim 's women always ended up sad , Pa 's mad . Nick preferred his own women glad . Not that it always worked out that way , thank God . He had n't seen Yvette Malone for more than four months . He took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him . What a beautiful thing she was , he thought . She had kind of burnished brown hair  --  red hair , really  --  and eyes as green as avocados . She was so smart she could speak Italian , French and German with a Texas accent . He was suddenly direfully needful to be in some kind of contact with her , so he asked the steward for some notepaper and began to write her a letter . " Dear Yvette , " he wrote , " I am wearing the lime-colored silk underwear and thinking of you . But when do we get out of the underwear phase ? Not that I want ties . But pajamas would be nice . You must be yearning for a letter like this . You have ninety-six pairs of stockings I know of . Why do n't we switch ? I 'll give you underwearand you give me navy-blue lisle socks , size eleven . " Disaster has struck . When I explain it I realize everything is going to sound like a bad movie , but are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This family secret has to come out sometime ( between us , that is ) , and the whole framework of theevents leading to the reason why I any on my way to Philadelphia  |p48and  Palm Springs without the slightest chance that I can stop over in Paris long enough to make love gives me as good a chance to let the skeleton out for an airing as I guess I 'll ever have . To put the whole thing bluntly : Timothy Kegan , a President of the United States , was my half brother , and now a man has just died in Asia who said he was just one of the people hired by somebody to kill my brother , so now I have to rush into the labyrinths of this melodrama , extract the answer to the enigma ( which is probablythat a man named Z. K. Dawson was the man who hired the killers ) , confront my unpredictable father with all that is happening , and , generally as well as particularly , have my life light up TILT for the next month or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly . There is not one chance in a million that , after fourteen long years of covering tracks ruthlessly , the man ( Dawson , if it is Dawson ) or men who paid for Tim 's death can ever be found . But I have to do it as the Avenging Brother , because entertainment has taken over culture and we all live in a movie , or worse , in a mid-morning TV soap outcry . " I can not imagine that you will continue to stay on in the coldest city in the world ( in January ) . You are probably on the beach at Grenada right now . I ca n't wait to get to London to call you to find out . " He put Yvonne 's letter aside , because writing about Pa and what he would be walking into with Pa had brought out his never-absent dread of seeing Pa again . He would be in the worst sort of a position : the fink who brought bad news to Thomas Xavier Kegan about his most sacrosanct property  --  the dead son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . He did n't remember knowing either Pa or Tim until he was nine years old . For the seven years before that he had been a Thirkield , not a Kegan , because his mother had divorced Pa and had made him pay her a huge sum of money without a murmur . Whatever Pa had done to deserve the loss of such a lady ( and allthat money ) must have been at least slightly disreputable.  |p49Nick  had known Tim for eighteen years . Then he subtracted the three years when he had been nine then twelve and Tim had been off to war . Then he subtracted one of the two years at the end of their time together , because he had fled Pa and America to go into the oil business in the Middle East when he was twenty-five . Tim was dead two years later . The salvaged single year had been made up of fragments of disconnected pieces of time  --  short bursts at the White House , at Palm Springs , at Camp David , at the Walpole , or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa would n't be there . All told , he had known Tim for only fourteen years out of the forty-two of Tim 's life . Fourteen had been plenty . Tim was Pa and Pa was Tim . What had made Tim such a glorious achiever ( Pa , always Pa ) had made Nick faceless . Tim was gloriously dead at forty-two . Nick was merely indefinably alive . Even Yvette Malone had never remembered him long enough to write him a letter spontaneously . True , she always answered his letters  --  which was a differentthing altogether . Nick brooded that he might live to be twice Tim 's age and exist as a sort of vegetable unless he could master Tim 's knack for living so warily . But he 'd be damned if he would , because it was a knack Pa also had . Pa 's idea of being lusty and alive was to fart at a state dinner , then nearly laugh himself into a hernia . He supposed that both he and Tim had been born with souls resembling Pa 's soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother had taken him away from Pa and he had been saved . After his mother had been killed in the car with Gabriel Thirkield , Pa had ordered Nick to come home , although Pa was n't there , because there was a war on and serious money to be made . Nick had been nine . To his great relief ( and even greater joy after Tim got to the White House ) Nick kept the name Thirkield , because Mama 's will said if Pa tried to change it back , Nick would n't get one cent of her money ( which had all been left to him ) . Pa deeply respected that kind of logic . Tim was off in the war . The headof the house at Palm Springs was Pa 's Chinese butler . It had been  |p50a  big change from the leafy , green , temperate coolness of Harmonia , New York , to Pa 's fortress house in the desert . It was all like another planet . The object Nick missed most was his mother 's dear old Rolls , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worked on it herself , fiddling with the engine , changing tires and oil , washing it like the family pet it was . Every other day Mama and he would drive the cook , who sat on the back seat , to the meat market in the village . The butcher would bring the meat out of the shop to the car on tray after tray so that Mama and the cook could look it over and choose . Then Mama would drive the Rolls back to Harmonia Hall , and the butcher 's boy would pedal out to deliver the meat , arriving an hour after them . He remembered the epergne at the center of Mama 's table on which she would place the bowl filled with homemade caviar on the one day a month when she would invite the locals in to be enthralled by her music . Mama made caviar out of tapioca , fish broth , squid ink and lemon juice , which allowed each guest to have as much caviar as he or she wished . " It would be a cruel thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit , " Mama had explained . Tim had been twenty-four when he went into the war , in London , on the staff of Major General James Nolan , head of the socially blessed Ultra action group , which plotted and wove behindlocked doors that were themselves within a series of locked doors . No one but General Nolan knew what anyone in Ultra was doing . Long after the war it was finally revealed that Tim had been Nolan 's cryptanalyst . Nolan was a Texan and a West Pointer and a former roommate of Pa 's at Notre Dame . General Nolan awarded Tim a Presidential Citation for , he said in the **26;855;TOOLONG , breaking a Spanish code that transmitted Spain 's African intelligence about weather conditions around the Ouagadougou region of French West Africa . Four months before the war ended , well after the invasion , Tim was transferred toGeneral Patton 's ( colorful ) Third Army as aide-de-camp to Majorp51General Anthony " Tuffy " Godwin . Here Tim had won , on GeneralGodwin 's personal citation , the army 's Silver Star for leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Martonsburg in the Hilda Hess sector " at immeasurable personal risk in a feat of incomparable daring . " After the war Tuffy Godwinhad joined Thomas Kegan 's bustling , belching rabbit warren of subornment in Washington as Procurement Officer in charge of Pentagon entertaining . Pa was very proud of Tim 's military decorations . Tim had gone to Yale law school before the army , because lawyers screwed up the country best . After the war Pa okayed two years for him at the Yale drama school , because the theater was good training for politics , but he made Tim finish off with a master 's degree in political science at Harvard nonetheless . Cross an American lawyer with a political scientist and you get a mad scientist , Tim told Nick . Pa had had General Nolan made a papal count , and the Generalagreed to manage Rockrimmon , a Kegan estate in Connecticut , for all his years after the war . Rockrimmon was the one family property Nick had never been invited to visit . General Nolan was the one old family friend he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " disreputable diversions " there . Tim had used Rockrimmon now and then as a hideout when he attended out-of-town tryouts of musicals in New Haven ( " Not since WoodrowWilson has an American President shown his degree of passionfor the American popular theater " ) so he could take the young ladies of the casts to Rockrimmon and screw them . By 1950 Tim had been elected to the House of Representatives . By 1955 he was in the Senate . At the end of his first week in the Senate , Pa opened Tim 's active campaign for the presidentialnomination . Before Pa masterminded a presidential campaign , a successful candidate had pretended to wait for his party 's nomination to come to him . Pa said that was a lot of shit . He said Tim would have to go into a few primaries to make everythinglook good , but that was what the party system was for : to let the  |p52bosses  handle the rest . He said it was a waste of time and money to run in all the primary convention states except where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few primaries could punch up the whole script and fool all of the people all of the time , was how he felt . Pa believed in using his money and his power where it could count most  --  in nonprimary convention states where the political professionals really controlledtheir people . For three years Pa had been spending big money to find out , state by state , what it was that made each key delegate jump . When he needed their votes for the first big ballot at the nominating convention , his supply of jumping beans proved to be inexhaustible . The marvel of the Presidency , Tim told Nick over and over , was the dramatic acceleration of the action . By his records , until the time he had entered the House he had scored four hundred and seventy girls . By the time he entered the Senate , only five years later , he had scored nine hundred and three girls , which was pretty fantastic acceleration itself , Tim said , considering it had taken him a lifetime to make it to four seventy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Presidency until the day he was inaugurated the score had soared to nearly sixteen hundred ( three the morning of Inauguration Day )  --  which showed what the power of entering the highest political office could do . " Boy , when you enter , you really enter , " Nick had said admiringly . Because of his interest in the theater and related arts Tim tended to screw actresses more than others , but his favorites had also included a Belgian princess , an Eastern chief of government , thirty-four heiresses , one hundred and fifty-three models , nine professional tennis players , many lady lawyers , doctors , astrologers and chiropractors , two hundred and ninety-one newspaper and television women , some ordinary taxpayers , a population of the wives of senators , ambassadors , congressmen and the more powerfulbusinessmen , labor leaders and industrialists in the Unitedp53States , Western Europe and the coastline cities of South America  --  and one lady astronaut . When Nick was in his early twenties and Tim was in the White House manufacturing acutely dangerous missile crises during his first eleven months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great leaders had done that sort of quantity copulating  --  Julius Caesar and Atatiirk were examples . Nick was forty-one now , and he marveled at how little effect this consideration had had on him , thus separating him from leadership , perhaps because he had not overscrewed . He calculated that he had slept with about twelve or sixteen women in his life  --  and he did n't have any idea whether this was average or underaverage . He did n't envy Tim , because of the prodigious complications arising from Tim 's copulations along the way , although Tim had said that most of the betrayed husbands felt honored . It was the goddam press , Tim said , that cost him the most ass . They had forced spectacular strains on Tim in making him try to find places to screw . Eluding the press had been a superhuman feat . Therefore , most of the time there was an air of catch-as-catch-can , of improvisation , about Tim 's sexual feats . Many times he would have despaired that he would ever meet the circumstances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking with her alone in a White House corridor and spotting an empty cloakroom , he would push her in there , enter her among the overcoats and furs , standing , then put them both together again and continue along the corridor to the reception , the lady almost unable to believe that such a thing had happened to her . The White House Secret Service detail learned to cooperate with maneuvers like that , although the Chief was ever nervous that one of those women could be a plant , and he would have borne the blame if the President had got himself stabbed or shot in some employees ' rest room . Just the same , all the horrible difficulties notwithstanding , sometimes late at night while he tried to sleep under mosquitonetting beside a field of pumping rigs four hundred miles from  |p54|places  only about eleven people had ever been to , knowing that the native women with their smells were not for him , Nick would become wistful . But when he got back to the cities he refused to make any big effort to get women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he could not live with that . Early on , he had concentrated on the piano instead . It was n't a substitute , but it was a comfort.  |p5510:05  A.M. , MONDAY , JANUARY 28 , 1974-ENROUTE TO GERMANYHe got off the plane to stretch his legs at New Delhi . He stayed in his seat at Beirut . When the plane was airborne to Frankfurt he decided to risk having a half bottle of champagne . After the wine he fell asleep , and slept until the plane reached Germany . In Frankfurt he marched the letter to Yvette straight to the airport post office and sent it as registered mail . He used registered mail only for love letters . As the plane headed out toward London he felt the old bafflement again  --  a permanent confusion of doors slamming in his face , lights going off , distant voices singing that there was absolutely nothing to worry about , all of it repeated over and over again until , manipulated and bored , he had turned away , along with most of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told themselves , that the Pickering Commission was the receptacle of the consciences of seven wise men , seven just men who had pored themselves almost blind over every scintilla of the evidence , which had at last filled twenty-six volumes . These great men had finally decreed , separately and together , that there had been no conspiracy , that there had been only one lone , mad killer . Repeat : no conspiracy . Repeat : no conspiracy . With the help of the reassuring press  --  that greatest single continuing conspiracy of modern civilization  --  life had gone on , the nonconspiracy untroubled . Nothing could change except the truth . The plane began its descent into London.  |p56TUESDAY  MORNING , JANUARY 29 , 1974-LONDONDavid Carswell was easy to spot in the VIP lounge at Heathrow . He was the opposite of a jolly fat man . He was a mean fat man who explained away his fat by claiming he had diabetes . He was eating buttered sugar buns , slurping coffee and pouting like the spout of a pitcher when Nick came up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , producing an even more intense reaction than usual from his employer , " I am frightfully worried about this Teekay desertion . " " You do n't look it , " Nick said . " Your father is n't going to like it at all . Not one bit . " " We are not going to talk about it . " " It took you five months to set it up , and now you just walk away from it . " His accent was plum-perfect Oxbridge with just a soupcon of Hammersmith . " Aarrgghhh ! " Nick said . " I think that is a desperately unfriendly attitude to take , Nick . It is hurtful and really uncalled-for . " " Did you bring my clothes ? " " Marian could not find the winter underwear in your flat . " " Did you buy me some winter underwear ? " " The shops were not open . It was far too early . " " You brought everything else ? " " Yes . " " Thank you . " " Whether you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an explanation about the Teekay . " " If you had brought the winter underwear you would be entitled to an explanation . " " You are being monstrous . " " Do you have any silver ? " " Yes . " " Call Marian . Send her to my flat . Tell her to look in the bottom drawer of the highboy in the second bedroom . Tell her to bring the underwear here . " " Who will run the office ? "  | " I do n't care if it burns . Get me that underwear . " Carswell got up . He waddled away three steps , then turned . " I can have them bring a telephone to me here . " " Oh , no , you wo n't . Go to a booth and shut the door . " Nick glared at his back . The twit . He ordered tea . He was impatient to get Carswell out of there for good so that he could talk to Yvette at his leisure . It took Carswell twenty minutes to get back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Did you talk to Miles Gander ? " " He will be charmed to have breakfast with you tomorrow morning . " Good . " He decided to fire Carswell as soon as he could find a replacement . " That 's all . You may go , David . " " It is Monday morning . I do have an extraordinary amount of work to do . " " Well , go and do it . " They shook hands limply . David waddled away . Nick asked for a telephone . He dialed Yvette 's number in Paris and instantly she was on the line . " Yvette ? Nick . " " Nick ? Oh , boy ! Are you in town ? " " London airport . " " Oh . " " I am dazzled to know that I am this close to you . The Channel and a little hunk of France is all . Nothing like half the world between us . " " How come you 're at the London airport ? " " I put it all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I may not see it  --  I mean for a couple of months . I 'm going to the States in about two days . " " Where to ? " " New York first . " " How long will you he there ? " " ' Through January . Then Jamaica or something . "  | " Can we have dinner Thursday night ? I have to go to Palm Springs but I can make it to your place by eight on Thursday . " " Oboyoboyoboy . " " It 's been almost four months . " " I know . " " Just talking to you is too much . I do n't know how I can be this close and not see you . " " Do n't even say it , Nick . " " Okay . So long . " " I love you , Nick . " He hung up in a pink daze . He drifted to the newsstand and bought paperbacks and magazines . Marian arrived with the underwearin a plastic shopping bag . She was a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to wear a long skirt in London in January , Carswell must be underpaying her . " I had a crazy cabbie , " Marian said . " He must be fleeing the police . Are n't taxis supposed to have speed governors ? " " How much do we pay you , Marian ? " " Twenty-three pounds a week . Why ? I did n't miss finding the underwear the first time round . David forgot to tell me . " " Give me your notebook . " In fullest holograph he wrote a note to Carswell saying that henceforth Marian was to be paid thirty pounds a week . That should annoy the repulsive twit , he thought . Marian stared at the note . " But  --  why , Mr. Thirkield ? I 'm really not very good at anything in an office . Honestly , I could have missed your underwearthe first time this morning even if David had told me . " " You were n't good at anything in an office because you were underpaid , " Nick said . " Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I do n't want to spend my life improving at this . If I could find a husband I 'd be away from you like a shot . " " Perfectly all right . " " You may not understand it , but you are trying to obligate me , Mr. Thirkield . It 's as though thirty pounds a week were my price.  |p59This  could change my life . This could make me so obligated that I would stop looking for a husband and turn into an office creep like a girl David Carswell . " " What do you want me to do , Marian ? I 'll do whatever you say . " That 's all right , Mr. Thirkield . " " I 'll take it back . Here , we 'll tear it up . " " No , " she said glumly . " That 's all right . It 's my problem now , limit ? " She turned away from him and walked toward the exit of the lounge . The pink haze had lifted again.  |p60JANUARY  29 AND 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five that afternoon . He checked into the Petroleum Club . " You are looking worse than I have ever seen you look , sir , " the reception clerk said genially . Nick was very much pleased . " I 've been on an airplane from Borneo . " " Travel is terrible punishment , sir . " " Please tell the operator to post Do Not Disturb signs all over the switchboard . That includes my father  --  I mean , most of all my father . " " Yes , sir . " " And please send a man up to wake me at eight thirty tomorrowmorning . " He slept for fifteen and a half hours , until the bell captain shook him awake . At nine fifteen he shambled into the baroque Victoriandining room with its magnificent portrait of Edward VII as a young man , by James Richard Blake the immortalist . The room was a womb of the past in deep green and heavy gold . Miles Gander was waiting for him , a thin and melancholy man with a high bald head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking very well indeed . Nick was ravenous . He had n't eaten for two days . They ordered at once . " Somebody said you ran into a string of dry wells , Miles . " " Quite an advertisement for an oil geologist , was n't it ? " " Need any money ? " Miles shook his head in a melancholy way and went on nibbling at a piece of toast . He was smallish , with a birdlike face and a squamulous nose , as though he were an evolutionary map of **26;883;TOOLONG . " I can not stand David Carswell any longer , Miles . " " He is impossible . But he knows everything . " " We are too small an operation to fit in a fellow like that . " " But whom would you get ? " " I thought I 'd ask you . " " A desk job ? No , " he said sadly . " I 'm a geologist , Nick  --  butp61I thank you . " Every shading of Gander 's manner was melancholy , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper malaise than the loss of money . " If you ca n't bear Carswell , try Ed Blenheim in Tulsa . " The food arrived . Nick attacked an enormous pile of scrapple , about which Edward VII had said ( in that room ) , " Philadelphia is filled with people named Scrapple , and they all have biddle for breakfast . " After a while Miles said , " What did you want to see me about , Nick ? " He coughed lightly . " It could n't be about the job , because you would n't have had David call me if it were . " " I need your integrity , " Nick said . Miles winced . " A man who was working for Keifetz fell off a crane in Brunei . He knew he was dying . He confessed that he had been one of the two men who had shot my brother . " " My God ! " " He told us where he hid the rifle . Here in Philadelphia . So I wanted to ask you for two favors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police official ? Second , will you come along with us as witness that the rifle has been found  --  if it is found ? " Miles wet his lips . He took a sip of water . He had a mouthful of black coffee . He dabbed at his mouth with a napkin , drying it . " Yes , " he said . " I can do those things . " ' Thank you . " " When do you want me to do this ? " " Now , if you can . " " I 'll go out to the hall and telephone . " He got up abruptly and left the table . Nick thought he had become a different man since the bankruptcy . He had to need money . He decided to press it on liinc . I lc ordered more scrapple , with poached eggs and fried apples , and more hot toast and coffee . When he was in Asia ; he had dreamed of scrapple  --  a divine marriage of American Indian cornmeal with the genius of German sausage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came hack . " Anp62inspector of police named Heller is on his way over . " Nick said , " I do n't believe you when you say you do n't need money . Let 's get this straight , Miles . I am your friend , and there are things you have to make yourself accept from friends . I am worried about you . I want you to tell me how much money you will need , and that will be that . " Miles 's eyes suddenly brimmed with tears , but they held . He looked away , and after a time the tears were gone . " The fact is , Nick , " he said , " I would have grabbed that offer last night . But everything was settled last night . I have the money . I do n't need to be a bankrupt . " Deputy Inspector Frank Heller came into the dining room in full uniform , fruit salad across his left chest and a gold badge that gleamed like a searchlight under the commendations . He was a beefy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook hands as though it were a karate maneuver . He sat at the table , refused breakfast , because he never ate breakfast , he said , grudgingly accepted some coffee , then asked if there was any raisin bread , then asked if he could have some red currant jelly to go along with the raisin bread . " Why not have some lamb with the red currant jelly , Frank ? " Miles asked . " The scrapple is great , " Nick said . " Scrapple ? Well . I 'd like to try some scrapple . " He nodded to the waitress . " What 's up ? " he asked Miles . " This is all very delicate and confidential , Frank , as you will see , " Miles said . The inspector grunted . It was like a random hit on a bass drum . He looked quickly from one face to the other . His eyes had large pouches of blackness under them , as if he had rubbed them with sooty mittens . " Everything is , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kegan , " Miles said . " We work together in the oil industry . " Heller nodded with automatic , sympathetic appreciation , thenp63he caught himself and went on the defensive . " We did everything humanly possible to protect your brother here , Mr. Thirkield . But you ca n't protect anyone from a nut . I hope you realize that . " " I do n't know anything about it , " Nick said . " Two days ago in the Far East a man confessed to having killed my brother . " " Impossible . " " And he told us where he had hidden the rifle . In Philadel-phia . " " Out of the question . " " His name was Arthur Turkus Fletcher . " Heller grunted again . It had a threatening sound . Boar hunters have heard the sound . The food arrived , so they stopped talking until the waitress left . Heller attacked the scrapple as if it were trying to devour him first . He finished everything on the plate before he spoke again . " You read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The short version . " " There was no second rifle . " " Inspector , " Nick said with all the innocent arrogance of his relationship to the late President , the late President 's father 's billion dollars , and the thirty-seven thousand , nine hundred crunch people his father knew in the crevices and on the pinnacles , " when you finish your coffee we will go out of here and see if we can find that rifle . The rifle will have Fletcher 's fingerprints on it , and taped to it we should find his full name . As you will discover , the prints will match the fingerprints of the man who confessed , taken two days ago by the police in Brunei , on Borneo . They will also be shown to be the prints of a man who worked for eight years as a professional marksman for the National Rifle Association with the rating of Master . When we have all those things in hand I will give you a certified copy of the deposition Flectcher made in Brunei before he died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to make a deposition as to what youwill have witnessed this morning . My father and I will then takep64a complete copy of this record , with the weapon , to the President to request a reopening of the investigation under a congressional commission . That is all . " There was a delay of ten minutes while the desk located the club 's engineer so that he could lend the expedition a large wrench . They drove to the Engelson Building in a black police car that had a uniformed police driver . They found the manager of the Engelson Building in his office . The inspector explained that they wanted to make an examinationof Room 603 . The manager looked the room up in a notebook , then dialed on his telephone . " Mr. Kullers ? This is David Coney , the building manager . I wonder if we could trouble you for a few minutes for a look around your office . " He put his hand over the receiver . " He wants to know what for , " he said to Inspector Heller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steam pipe , Mr. Kullers , " Coney said into the phone . " Thank you . " He hung up . " There are no steam pipes in this building , " he said . " This does n't involve Mr. Kullers , does it ? " " How long has he leased 603 ? " Heller asked . " About four years . " " Probably not , then , " Heller said . The four men went to the elevator . Lettered on the door of 603 were the words JOHN KULLERS and VENDING MACHINES . Coney knocked . A voice told them to come in . A rumpled , red-haired man wearing heavy black horn-rimmed glasses exactly like Miles Gander 's was alone in the room checking figures at a desk , his back to the two windows . " Cops ? Why cops ? " he said . " Are you Kullers ? " Heller said in a hard voice . " Who else ? " " Go down the hall and smoke a cigarette or wash your hands or something . You can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Listen  --  it would only take a little time to get a search warrant , but I can get one . " " A search warrant to find a steam pipe ? There it is . " He gestured . " And while you 're getting the search warrant see if you can find the two milk machines somebody palmed on me at Bryn Mawr last Friday . What is there to search ? I am a one-man operation . " " Do I have to get a warrant ? " " You can search , but I am staying . " Heller shrugged . He took the big wrench to the vertical heating pipe . " That never worked , " Kullers said . " It is n't even supposed to be there , " Coney added . There was a sleeve joint halfway up the pipe . Heller tightened the wrench around it , applied force and turned . The sleeve fell to the floor around the pipe with a clatter . The Inspector and Nick separated the pipe and looked downward . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star-shaped wooden rack out of the pipe . Attached to the rack was the barrel of the .30 MID . Heller lifted it out very carefully by the tip of the barrel and the rack . Nick felt light-headed . His hands began to shake hanging beside him . He had never looked at a rifle and seen it to mean certain death before , designed for death , accomplished only in death . " What the hell is that ? " Mr. Kullers said . " I 'll tell you one thing . That ai n't mine . " 1 feller sent Mr. Coney down the hall for some towels . MilesGander stumbled to a chair and sat down heavily . He looked ill . " What was that doing in there ? " Mr. Kullers asked shrilly. " 1 ) ou't think you can pin that goddam thing on me . " Coney came hack with a large , soft roll of paper towels . Hellercarefully wrapped the rifle on all sides then secured the packagewitli Scotch tape front Mr. Kullers ' desk . " This goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package on the floor , and moving very deliberately to increase his menace , he walked behind Mr. Kullers ' desk and lifted him to his feet by his shirt and tie . " You make one sound about what you saw here this morning and you will be the sorriest little man in this state , " he said . He dropped Kullers . He turned to the building manager . " That goes for you too . You understand ? " The manager nodded : very bright eyes . " Well , fuck you for a start , " Mr. Kullers said , whacking InspectorHeller across the back of the head with a large , heavy , green Scotch-tape dispenser and dropping him to his knees . " I am an American citizen , you Cossack , and you can take a flying fuck back to Poland . " Heller picked himself up and charged . Nick slammed himself between the two men . He was less bulky than the inspector but he was twenty years younger , and he was able to back him against the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is simply no call for this , Inspector , " he said . " No call at all . Mr. Kullers is absolutely right . " " You are goddam right I am right , " Mr. Kullers yelled . " No more Mr. Nice Guy . I am going to bring you up for invading without a warrant , you fucking bellhop . " Heller nodded to Nick that he was in control of himself . Nick released him . Heller went straight to the rifle , picked it up and left the room . " Will somebody tell me what this is all about ? " Mr. Kullers said , disheveled and red-faced . Nick walked to the window and stood beside him . He looked down over Hunt Plaza . " That gun was fired from this window , " he said , " to kill President Kegan . " Kullers gaped . Coney lifted his right hand to the side of his face . " Well , why did n't he say that ? " Kullers asked . " All he had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? You could get killed just knowing a thing like that . " All the way down in the elevator David Coney kept saying , " Ip67do n't like it . This is bad . This is trouble . I do n't like it . " On Market Street Nick and Miles Gander walked slowly in the general direction of the Petroleum Club in Rittenhouse Square . " Who hired Fletcher ? " Miles asked . " He did n't know . There was a go-between . He said he thought it would be someone like Z. K. Dawson , " " It sounds like Dawson , " Miles said . " I 've worked for him . I 've heard him sound off against your brother because of the depletion allowance . But threats to the allowance made a lot of Texans feel murderous . Still , Eldridge Mosely was Dawson 's man . " " Mosely had nothing to do with this foul business . " " I did n't say he had . But Z.K. made Eldridge the governor of Pennsylvania . Z.K.

" The post was delivered at the Avenue de la Bourdonnais at nine fifteen ayem . A houseman in a starched white coat signed for the registered letter from Frankfurt . He gave it to a parlor maid , who took it up the white flying staircase to Madame 's personal maid , who walked it across two rooms to Madame , who was making elaborate lists having to do with the organization of her packing for both New York and Jamaica . Madame let out a yelp of pleasure when she looked at the envelope , stopped her work and sat down to read the letter . She asked the maid to bring her a cup of tea . She read the letter smiling , with total absorption . She stopped smiling . A look of shock that almost immediately turned into a look of loss set itself into a mask of tragedy . She covered her face with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1974 - PALM SPRINGSNick was on the ground at the Los Angeles airport at four ten in the afternoon . He chartered a helicopter to fly him to the pad at Pa 's rambling white stucco house south of Palm Springs which had once been called " the western White House . " Flying in over the Springs , he was able to identify nine of the great houses wherein Tim had screwed his hostesses . When they flew over Lola Camonte 's pleasure complex he grinned with vicarious pleasure as he thought of the dozens of long , friendly talks Tim and the great Mexican star had had , one lying atop the other . Nick wished he could have seen her in the last great scene , which Tim would always allude to but refused to be explicit about . Just thinking about that last scene made Tim howl with glee . The chopper went in over Pa 's own eighteen-hole golf course , which was as green as Ireland in the middle of the desert and set down there not only because Pa liked uncrowded golf but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in the rest of the world who might like to take a shot at Pa . Li Hsi was standing beside the pad with a security man , waving wildly and looking exactly as ageless as when Nick had first seen him : standing at the front door when the huge car had driven nine-year-old Nick to the house . Si was an extremely scrutable Chinese who could whoop and weep and waffle at the drop of a hat . Si wrapped his arms around Nick and giggled madly as he welcomed him home . Si was probably the only Chinese out of some 800,000,000 who had always called President Kegan by his first name . " How long you gung be here ? " he asked happily . " Until about like three o'clock tomorrow afternoon . " " Ah . Long time . " " I should be in Australia right now . But I have to talk to Pa . " " Pa not here . " " Not here ? When will be be back ? "  | " Tonight . Mebbe ten o'clock , twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure will . " " I fix . Eight o'clock . What you like to eat ? " " Anything . " " Anything so long is chili and noodles , hey , Nick ? I fix . " On the way to Nick 's apartment , which was in its own cottage about sixty yards from the main building , Nick asked Si if his father 's library had the full twenty-six-volume Pickering CommissionReport . " We have . But only make you sad , Nick . No good . " " You told me all learning is good . " " I bring . I send Keith as soon as he come . " Keith was Si 's son . He was a psychiatrist with the Riverside County medical staff . He was a fine doctor , a better chess player , a good painter , a great cellist , a loving husband and a gaga father . He had married a third-generation Californian whose greatgrandparentshad been working Eskimos who , Keith said , had overshot Nome with a dogsled . Their three children were as Oriental as pandas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banjo . The twenty-six volumes of the Pickering Report arrived by golf cart as Nick finished unpacking his bags . He settled down at a large desk with the volume that covered the time slot of the assassination which Turk Fletcher had described . It was as though he were reading a ponderous fairy tale written by lawyers . Except for its description of Hunt Plaza and the route by which the motorcade had crossed it , the official account was like the testimony of a witness in Rashomon  --  totally different from what Fletcher said had happened , yet immovably sure of itself . Three hours later a security man knocked at the door to say that dinner was ready . Nick and Keith had a grand reunion while Si beamed on them . They had been through more together than most boyhoodp70chums . Keith had admitted Nick to the Riverside Hospital as his psychiatric patient a year after Tim 's killing . Nick was in the hospital for five months , and the treatment was continued at Pa 's house for four months after that . Having put Nick together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa were concerned . Nick 's emotional collapse had happened because he had been able to sleep less and less as he waited for Pa to come to tell him that it would be necessary for Nick to take Tim 's place to get Pa 's work done . But they did n't talk about that anymore . Keith watched him closely wondering if Nick thought like that anymore , but Si joined them at table , so there was no clinical talk . Si had made them Chinese noodles cooked in won ton , then covered with a thick rug of chili , which they ate with two bottles of cold white wine from the North Coast counties . Si chortled , wept and burped through the meal , pausing now and then to take a phone call in the pantry . Nick was having the best time he had had since being in bed with Yvette Malone , and he was achieving a form of double-think : while he enjoyed the presence of his two oldest friends he levitatedYvette over the kitchen table mentally so that he could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual question : " When are you getting married , Nick ? " At last he had something definite to report . " It just happens that I almost asked a girl to marry me the day before yesterday , " Nick said . " Oh , boy , " Keith said . " Wait til Grace hears this . She 'll give a big party whether you can come or not . " " What did the lady say ? " Si asked . " When is the wedding day ? " " She did n't say anything . She went right on talking as if she had n't heard me . " Nick really enjoyed this fantasy . " You must have surprised her , " Keith said . " You have to lead up to things like that . " " Maybe I did surprise her . Maybe I was too sudden . " They heard the sound of a chopper coming in from Palmp71Springs . " The boss ! " Si said joyfully , leaping to his feet and standing behind Nick 's chair to pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the front door , " Keith said . Si guided Nick along the shortcut to the helicopter pad . The area was densely lighted by flood lamps on high poles . Two security men had taken their positions on either side of the pad to watch all approaches . Two more would be with Pa in the chopper . The helicopter was a ten-seat U.S. Army utility tactical transport whose lengthened cabin had been luxuriously refitted . It had been made by Bell and fitted with a Lycoming T53 L-i3 engine that could cruise at a service ceiling of twenty-two thousand feet over a range of three hundred and fifteen miles . Pa used it to get to his jets at the Palm Springs airport and sometimes to go into L.A.Some people scramble out of helicopters , but it is a thing that takes practice . A security man pushed a ramp elevator up to the door of Pa 's machine . He stepped out on its platform into the glaring theatrical lights and was lowered gently to the ground like a ballerina in the arms of the first dancer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa was wearing a scarlet linen waistcoat under a white bawneen jacket . He had a sheared mink overcoat across his left forearm and a large billycock bowler on his head . His face was so deeply creased with lines that it looked as though it had been plowed by a combine . He was smoking a thick black cigar . He smiled horrendously when he saw Nick , displaying what looked like row upon row of huge white false teeth that seemed to have been made of mother-of-pearl . " I knew you 'd be here , you little son-of-a-bitch , " he bawled . " What 's this I hear about you screwing Carswell 's secretary in London ? " The two men came together and embraced with a great show of fake feeling . " Carswell is through , " Nick shouted over the sound of the engines . " Do n't be a chump , " Pa said . " Where are you going to findp72another guy who knows his stuff like Carswell ? " " I 'll run Jemnito , Pa . You 're just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who got you the Alhart field in Tanzania ? Who set you with Somoza in Nicaragua ? Who 's gon na fit you into the North Slope after someone else figures out how to get the oil out ? Me , your commission salesman . " He threw a long bony arm around Nick 's shoulders and began to march him off to the house , asking Si , who trotted beside him , if he could find him three roast beef sandwiches and a bottle of beer . " Hey , you guys , " somebody yelled behind them , " wait for me ! " Nick turned and had the satisfaction of knowing that his father could not have known he was going to be there , because a small blonde , with muscular legs and a mouth as depraved as a Venetian principessa 's , wearing a fantasy pink-and-blue mink coat in wide checkerboard squares , was descending on the miniature elevator . Pa gestured to her angrily as if she had been a stowaway . " Get the hell out of here , " he yelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back to Chicago and I 'll call you next week . " " I will like hell , " she shouted . " My ass is sore now from riding in your goddam airplanes . " " Eddie ! " Pa yelled at the top of his voice . " Yes , sir ? " a short gray-haired man yelled back from beside the lift . " Put her in the De Mille cottage and give her a bottle of booze . And see that she does n't bother anybody . I 'm going to have a visit with my son . " He took Nick 's arm and dragged him quickly into the main house . Si bolted the door after them just in time , because the young woman 's small form hurled itself against it and she hammered on it with her fists . " Jesus . " Pa grinned . " If we only had some way to tell they had a temper when they first looked good to us , right ? " He kept walking . Nick followed him through a complex of corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's sleeping quarters . The room was decorated with photographs , busts , medals andp73paintings . Tim with Malraux and De Gaulle . Tim with Khrushchev . Tim with Adenauer . Tim with the Supreme Court . Tim with the cast of Hello , Dolly at Rockrimmon . Tim with the cast of the Bolshoi Ballet at Rockrimmon . Tim accepting honorary degrees . Tim with Harold Macmillan . Tim between Floyd Pattersonand Archie Moore . A life-size portrait of Tim in oils by James Richard Blake famed for his portrait of Edward VII . Tim with the senior class of Wellesley at Rockrimmon . Tim with Dr. MartinLuther King , Jr . A bust of Tim by Edward Delaney . An illuminated display case of Tim 's decorations : the Vatican State Order of the Golden Spur conferred " motu proprio " ; the Order of Charles III ( Spain ) ; the Order of the Elephant ( Denmark ) ; the Order of Merit of the Principality of Lichtenstein ; the YugoslavianGrand Star ; the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor ( France ) ; Polonia Restituta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baden-Powell Medal for the Perpetuation of World Scouting ( Britain )  --  all earned through connections of Pa 's before Tim had attained the Presidency . Far at the back of the piano , somewhat blocked from view by a large cabinet photograph of Tim wearing a ten-gallon hat shaking hands with Oveta Culp Hobby , there was a small framed snapshot of Tim with Nick , grinning at each other over a net on Pa 's tennis court , Nick not showing a single tooth . The north side of the living room displayed a rank of eleven transaction tickers that were even then reporting on stock , mineraland commodity markets . Pa picked up the tape of the nearest one reflexively and looked at it . " Drink ? " he asked mechanically . " Maybe some cold white wine . " " What were you looking at the Pickering Report for ? " " When did Si get a chance to fill you in on that ? " " I called from the plane before we got to LA . " " Well  --  that 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pickering Report ? " Si came iii with the sandwiches and the beer . He took Pa 's hat and coat . Pa asked him to bring Nick a bottle of white wine.  | " Tim , " Nick answered . " What about Tim ? " " Pa , this is going to jolt you , but I have to tell you . " " Okay , tell me . " " I was there three days ago in Brunei when a man named Turk Fletcher confessed on his deathbed that he had been one of the two riflemen who had shot Tim . No  --  wait ! " Nick stood up , cutting off his father 's protest with a raised hand . " This man told us where he had hidden the rifle in Philadelphia . I went there with the police and we found it . It is covered with the man 's fingerprints . It has his name taped to it . " To Nick , Pa 's face was terrible to look at . The thousands of things that seemed to be trying to crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jammed right behind his eyes . For Pa the moment was one of total release from the tensions of fourteen years , the bursting out of a long black tunnel . To Nick , Pa 's eyes seemed to scream . His face seemed to be falling apart . Tics began under his left eye and at the right corner of his mouth . For Pa the great moment had finally arrived . It had happened as he had dreamed it would happen , and the effect of it on him was transmogrifying . Nick saw that his father had turned dead white . He was all white  --  white seventy-fouryear-oldskin , with watery blue eyes and ketchup-red and white hair held in place by large out-jutting white ears . Staring at Nick , Pa began to weep , contorting his face into shocking grimaces , dragging clanking sobs out of his chest , causinghis head to shake with the regularity of a metronome from side to side , denying what he had done but seeming to deny what Nick had said . He stood motionless , his face glistening wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Si returned with the wine in a cooler . He set it down calmly . He went to Pa and led him slowly out of the room , permitting him to continue to weep without stop . He took Pa into thebathroom and closed the door between them and Nick.  |p75While  Si was helping Pa pull himself together again in the bathroom , Nick poured himself a glass of the cold wine , his hands shaking badly . He gulped the wine , then went to the piano and began to play Mozart mindlessly . After about fifteen minutes Pa came back into the room alone . Si had left the bathroom through another door . Pa took up a half of a thick sandwich , poured a glass of beer and sat down to listen to the music . Nick played through to the end while Pa ate the three roast beef sandwiches . Pa finished the last half of the last sandwich almost at the same time that Nick touched the last chord . " If this guy Fletcher was the second rifle when they killed Tim , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Keifetz hired him . " " But why with you ? All the way out in Asia ? " " Keifetz says sixteen people have been killed because they had little scraps of information about Tim 's murder . Fletcher had the biggest scrap of all , the main piece to the jigsaw , and we think he probably figured that whoever was looking for him  --  that is , looking for him to kill him  --  probably would n't think of looking for him in my company . " " But how come Keifetz hired him ? " " He was a good crane operator . Besides , he had a letter of recommendation from your friend General Nolan . " " Nolan ? James Nolan ? " " Tim 's old commanding officer . The man who runs Rockrimmonfor you . Whoever he is , I never met him . " " I 'll be goddamned . You mean , he sent this killer to Keifetz ? " " No . Not really . Fletcher was carrying around an old **27;911;TOOLONG from General Nolan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miles to find the rifle ? " Pa asked . " Inspector Heller . " " Oh , yeah . Who else was there ? "  | " The manager of the building and the occupant of 603 , a man named John Kullers . " " We 'll have to get a deposition from every one of them . I 'll handle that . " " The police are doing that . Heller took the rifle to the police lab , and by now they 're checking the fingerprints  --  and whatever else they do  --  with the FBI . " " That 's real evidence . " " We had a Shell lawyer take a deposition from Fletcher , the second rifleman , in Brunei . Keifetz got the Brunei police to lift Fletcher 's prints and take his photograph . Those are all in the mail now and on their way here . " " To this house ? " " Yes . " " Then we have a case . We have a case , " Pa said . " We are going to take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that , Pa . " " You did a wonderful job , Nick . " Nick blinked with gratitude . He felt a hard , dazing blow of almost paralyzing satisfaction . Pa had never said anything even distantly like that to him before . It was a glorious feeling . It was a feeling of glory . He clung to Pa 's words the way a groggy fighter clings to an opponent until his head clears . " I think it should be a congressional investigation , " Nick was able to say , " not a presidentialcommission . " " We wo n't have much to say about that . " " Yes we will . If the President refuses , we 'll take it to the press and TV . Anyway , no President would want to be solely responsiblefor the shameful necessity of a second time around in the investigation of the murder of an American President . He would n't dare to risk anything as sinister as the Pickering Commissionagain . " " Nobody would want it . But they would risk it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think we have to watch everything ourselves . With myp77people . We have to have a place in the investigation . You could be his liaison with the congressional committee . That would be good politics . " Pa looked glassy . Si must have sedated him , Nick thought . Pa began to wander about the room picking up pictures of Tim and rambling in his speech . " I am thinking about how we took the first primaries . Believe me , politics in a state like that involves a lot of money , and I mean under-the-bridge , over-the-table , and **25;940;TOOLONG money . All of it for a little state whose primary vote is n't even binding on the delegates it elects . Shit , I put out ninety-seven hundred primary-day workers alone . And we had the most gorgeous TV commercial you ever saw of Tim leading those three tanks across that Hilda Hess sector in Germanyto liberate that beleagured infantry column . Jesus , hei looked great . And there was one showing Tim very solemn , very respectful , holding his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prize right here in my library . We made a real noise in that shitty little state , kid . We got fifty-three real movie stars to turn out and roam up and down the state yelling Tim 's name . Sickleton 's people began to sneak in some money to the opposition in the primary , and I called up the son-of-a-bitch who was their head honcho and I said that if they did n't pull out every goddam Sickleton dime , Old Baldy would n't even be considered as Secretary of State . " Pa stopped and stared at a large photograph of Tim wearing the full headdress of a sachem of the Cherokee nation . When he turned to face Nick his eyes had filled with tears , but the sedation Si had given him held him down . " And all that time and later  --  and before  --  and during , " he said , " everything I did , every buck I spent , every threat I made , I was just leading Tim along the road to meet that bullet . " He sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more things , " Nick said evenly . " Like what ? " " Willie Arnold was not one of the riflemen . Somebody soldthat to the conuuission. "  | " Do we have to start this all over again ? " " There were two riflemen . Fletcher was one . He talked a lot about the other one . That 's the whole point of the new investigation . The commission did n't care who killed Tim  --  they only wanted to prove that there was no conspiracy . Well , there was a conspiracy . Our new investigation has to establish who hired those two riflemen and Willie Arnold . " Pa did n't seem to be listening . He was dazed , but Nick told himself he had to be getting the point . Pa himself had said what they had to do . " Pa ? " " What ? " " Every doctor who attended Tim after he was hit  --  and the doctor who performed the autopsy  --  said Tim had been shot from front and back . But the Pickering Commission twisted that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shot Tim , not whether he had done it . Then they buried the autopsy report for the next seventy-five years . " Pa , listen to me . If we 're not sure of all the facts , it 's because they were changed so often and so fast by the Pickering Commission , whose job it was to make sure of the real facts and bury them before the investigation was over . " " All right , Nick , " Pa said steadily . He seemed to have himself together . " We 'll quit talking and do something . " He sat down at the switchboard and took up the phone . " Get me Fred Frey , the police commissioner of Philadelphia . " He hung up . " Play something on the piano , Nick , " he said . " I have to think a little . " Nick went to the piano and began soothes by MacDowell . Pa stared at the Blake portrait of Tim . In about four minutes the telephone light went on and Pa picked up . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll understand why I have to take kind of a guarded tone here  --  do you have a lab report on that rifle yet ? " His face clouded with irritation . " Whatrifle ? This is Tom Kegan . Do n't kid around . Listen , you have ap79cop named Heller  --  Inspector Frank Heller  --  right ? Okay . Well , yesterday morning at  --  what time , Nick ? " " Quarter to eleven . " " At a quarter to eleven your man Heller in the presence of my son , Miles Gander  --  you know , the geologist  --  and two other witnesses , both residents of Philadelphia , found one of the rifles that was used "  --  Pa faltered , his voice broke  --  " was used in Hunt Plaza in 196o . " Nick moved away from the piano in tension while Pa listened on the telephone . " Why would I try to make a clown out of you ? " Pa said to Frey . He became incredulous . " Nobody told you anything about it ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better call Heller in , Fred . You better untangle your options . I 'll be waiting right here in Palm Springs for your call . " He disconnected . " You heard it , " he said to Nick . " Heller must be waiting for a confirming report from the FBI before he takes it to the commissioner . " " He 's a crook , " Pa said . " I mean , I feel that . " He got up and began to wander around the room again . " Nick , I hate to let them have another shot at burying all this . Everything I stand for resists the idea of taking what is absolutely my own vengeance to the government and asking strangers to avenge my son . " Nick was bland . " That 's the way it has to be , Pa . " " Is it ? Are we supposed to turn everything over to a pack of lobbygows again ? A strung-together scarecrow of mediocrities who are only interested in making sure the United States does n't look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to eat well only because they were eating at the public trough ?

Therep80were men convincing me that it would be scalding America with shame and disaster  --  and maybe even revolution  --  if I stood up and pointed a finger at some figure in American life and charged that he had paid to have Tim shot down in the streets . Yes . I went along . Because they gave me Willie Arnold 's body as representing Willie Arnold 's guilt , and I bought it because there was nothing else to do . " A telephone light went on . Pa picked up . " Yes , Fritz ? What 's the scam ? What ? That 's crazy . You 'd better haul Heller up on your carpet , my friend . Whaaaat ? Dead ? Heller is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He listened , staring at Nick with consternation . " Listen , Fred , I 'm going to put my son on the line and he 's going to give you the names and addresses of the three witnesses who saw Heller find that rifle and take it with him out of the Engelson Building . Hold on . " Pa put his hand over the mouthpiece . " Heller is dead of a heart attack . It happened some time this morning . The rifle has disappeared . " He gave Nick the telephone . " Commissioner ? I am Nicholas Thirkield , Mr. Kegan 's son . Yes , sir . Miles Gander . At the Petroleum Club . The building manager , David Coney . The third man ran a business in vending machines which occupied Room 603 . His name is John Kullers . That 's K-u-1-1-e-r-s . Yes , sir , I will report to you and make a sworn statement .

" Then it is n't a total loss . If all that is true , we know the man is still alive  --  that he survived these past fourteen years with the rest of us . " Pa grinned . His plaque teeth revealed themselves row on row . They shone in the light like files of ivory .

"  |p82MONDAY  , JANUARY 1 , 1900 - SAN FRANCISCOThomas Xavier Kegan was a professional Irishman and a professionalAmerican  --  each kept separate from the other . The operativeword " professional " is , as a noun : ( a ) one who professes to be skilled in and to follow assiduously the calling or occupation by which he habitually earns a living ; ( b ) one who trains himself in the skills required for theoretic and scientific exploitation of an occupation , as distinct from its merely mechanical parts , which raises the occupation to the dignity of a learned profession . Annually , for thirty-one years , Pa had been Honorary Grand Master of a St. Patrick 's Day parade , which he attended in one American city or another . He kept a card file of eleven thousand , four hundred Pat-and-Mike jokes which he told , with a " brogue " that was a mixture of Polish , Japanese and Italian accents , at Holy Name Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Patrick and the Knights of Columbus , at alumni dinners at Notre Dame and Holy Cross universities ; and he had been known to tell Irish dialect stories to Eamon de Valera in The Park . He was a member of nineteen Irish fraternal societies in Boston , New York , Liverpool , Capetown and Manchester . He had been granted the Freedom of Bodmor Truth in Rathfarnham , sponsored by Lord Butterfield himself , aged ninety-nine years . He had been awarded the Daithi Hanly Medal for Gaelgoiri twice , with its accompanying certificate made out to his Gaelic name , Tomaltac X. MacAogain . He owned offshore Irish oil leases . He wore green neckties and buttonhole shamrocks for the week preceding and the week following the anniversary of the death of Cromwell . He had disciplined himself to be able to tolerate Irish instrumental folk music , a talent that is almost impossible for the nonnative to acquire . Four times he had been offered the ambassadorshipto Ireland by four importuning American Presidents ( including his son ) , but each time he had , agonizingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assembly plant for joining together the parts of a certain popular automobile , and an Irish road-building company of some prominence among politicians inDublin . He had barmbrack flown to him twice a week , to Palmp83Springs , from O'Keefe 's own bakery in Schull on Roaringwater Bay in West Cork  --  and boxes of carrageen . These partisan manifestations were droll . If he had known the truth , he might have needed to be restrained with wet winding sheets and might ( almost ) have returned his many papal honors and his Irish marching society medals . Ethically and ethnically Tim 's Presidency would have had to be declared unconstitutional . Significant electoral votes , as ethnic as soda bread , such as those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , would need to have been bestowed retroactively upon his opponent . Thomas Xavier Kegan had no Irish ancestry . His father 's name had not been Kegan nor had that of any of his progenitors . Further , his ancestral family had all been Lutherans . The family name was Kiegelberg . In 1849 , at age twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant from Scheraldgriin , a small Alpine village in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland , had emigrated to join the California gold rush . The Kiegelbergs had always been cursed with arrogance , feeling themselves as people apart from and above the world because of their uniqueness in the **29;967;TOOLONG . Of the 6o6 people living there , 310 were named Marton , 126 were called Ketcham , 170 were known as Lear , and for 234 years fortune in the northern gold fields ( the Ornstein Nugget ) he moved to southern California , where he married Gertrude Garfunkel . In 1868 their son , Heini , abscondedwith his father 's principal savings , which caused his father'sdeath . Heini fled to San Francisco , where ( using the name Hank Kegan despite his heavy Scheraldgrun accent , . conferred by his father ) he built a large saloon in the Barbary Coast district of the city and named it Kegan 's . As Hank Kegan , Heini married an Italian girl from the Lugano area of Switzerland ( Maerose Carnaghi ) . On New Year 's Day 1900 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Thomas , then pronounced Toe-mahss . The infant 's parents and all records of his true family name at baptism , Kiegelberg , were destroyed in the great San Francisco earthquake , which began on April 18 , 1906 . The authoritiesentered the boy 's name as Thomas Kegan , taking the name from the child 's father 's saloon . Little Tom was raised by the Little Sisters of the Poor in a sound San Mateo boarding school for the children of the rich . The Little Sisters gave him the name Xavier at his confirmation . His father 's considerable estate appreciated at the Crocker Bank . Ever endowed with the mystical gift of piercing the heart of any matter instantly if the heart of the matter concerned money , Thomas Kegan sought and was granted a court order that forced the Little Sisters of the Poor ( how he hated that designation ! ) to release him into the guardianship of the prestigious Wall Street law firm of Swaine , O'Connell , Cravath &; O'Connell . He wanted his money put to work . At fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was graduated from that institutionwith honors for sports , religion and Irish studies . At eighteen he enrolled at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania , where he won two graduate degrees in accountancyand advanced finance in three years . In 1923 , at twenty-three , he was ready for the expanding bull market and for Prohibition . He was also readier than most when the slide began in 1929 to transmogrify himself into a ruthless bear . By 1934 , at thirty-four , he had increased his father 's pleasant **29;998;TOOLONG legacy to a far pleasanter five million , six hundred and forty thousand dollars in cash and shrewdly bought ( meaning entirely with bank loans ) Chinese boxes of real-estate parcels in eleven American cities worth thirty-one million , one hundred and fifty-six thousand dollars ( a 1934 evaluation ) . He realized a net profit of two hundred and seventy-three million dollars from even shrewder investments in liquor stocks and liquor production , using them to circumvent the Prohibitionlaw . He sold his liquor interests to eastern Mafia families whomp85he had helped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reinvested the funds in founding personal loanfinancingcompanies in twenty-eight states to provide welcome short-term small loans for his fellow Americans at 39 percent annual interest , and in three competing pharmaceutical manufacturingcompanies , which were to grow and expand ( in the sixties ) to produce 9,400 kilograms ( 2.5 billion pills ) of amphetamines and 5,382 kilograms of methamphetamines , which was 61 percent of the total ( U.S. ) market , as well as 23 percent of the tranquilizer and sleeping-pill market , with marketing problems greatly diminished through the help of the same grateful Mafia families . He balanced his cash investment in these home products and home banking with heavy buying into weapons-producing firms so that he could later feel he was backing up the Vietnam war effort when that effort cried out for help . He had done most of his major investing well before the wondrous 196o decade . Fourteen years after Tim 's mother 's death , Pa married his new , beautiful and in every way splendid wife , who became the mother of Nicholas one year after that . She divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her chagrin , Pa had infected her with a contagious catarrhal inflammation of the genital mucous membranedue to Neisseria gonorrhoeae . For this affront Pa paid Nicholas ' mother ten million dollars and the custody of Nicholas . In her modulated farewell Mrs. Kegan called Pa a guttersnipe , and for whatever reason far , far back in his extraordinary snobbism , which concealed his lack of belief in his own worth , Pa accepted this description as true . Therefore , after Mrs. Kegan became Mrs. Thirkield ( and was later killed ) he was forced to feel deep ambivalence toward her son . Nicholas knew well that his mother had been negatively moved by his father . She had not withheld her opinions of Pa during their son 's plastic years . By the time Nicholas was nine and his mother was dead , Nicholas had been formed by her opinions and was unable to feel other than infinitely superior to his father and to his half brother.  |p86This  was not Pa 's fault . More likely it was the fault of the necessity that had made Heini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making him seek punishmentby accepting snarls and humiliations from other older men whose advice helped make him rich . This cringing attitude in his father may have signaled the basic family inferiority to little Thomas , a six-year-old boy , so that even after a succession of brilliant accomplishments , when a beautiful woman of the world for whom he had the most respect was impelled by her shame to call him a guttersnipe , he had accepted that as truth , and in so doing had confirmed the belief in this of his wife and son . As the years took Nick and his father wider and wider apart , this confirmation gave authority to her teachings to her son . His half brother , Nicholas observed , was merely a satellite of his father and was therefore of the same common substance . Nicholas had been given reason for his undeniable arrogance by the towering nature of the superiority he felt for ( a ) the President of the United States and ( b ) a self-made multibillionaire  --  together the two most imposing American institutions . Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far than the blood that is thicker than water . Tim loved his silly little brother , who he thought was silly because he worked so hard to alienate the source whence all good things flowed  --  Pa . Nick was " little " to Tim because Tim was six feet three inches tall and Nick was about five feet nine . Like all tall men , Tim figured everyone else 's hostile acts in terms of the number of inches of height the offender lacked . Only Pa thought he knew what the deep displacement between himself and Nick was all about . His son obviously thought he , Thomas Kegan , was a guttersnipe . Nick saw it somewhat differentlybut in effect just as clearly : his father held him in contempt because he would not let his father run him as he had run Tim , because although his father was of a caste to give orders to Tim , it would be altogether unseemly for him to attempt to give ordersto Nick  --  circular frustration , circularly arrived at.  |p87THURSDAY  , JANUARY 31 , 1974 - PALM SPRINGSWhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half past ten . He was still exhausted from so many airplanes . He remembered the Philadelphia police commissioner and scrambled out of bed , was showered and dressed in twelve minutes , then called the kitchen to ask them to send him a pot of tea to his father 's office . Pa looked like a heap of ashes tied up in golfing clothes . As Nick came in he shook his head sadly . " I talked to Philadelphia . Miles Gander has disappeared . " " Miles is always traveling . That 's the kind of business he 's in . " Pa nodded blankly . " Yeah . But the Engelson Building manager and John Kullers of 603 are dead . " " Dead ? " " Suicides , Frey said . But he does n't believe it . " " No , " Nick said . " I told Frey I 'd pay for an all-points on Miles . And I put my own people out to find him . " " And Heller did n't die of any heart attack . " " Three out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In twenty-six hours . " " And the rifle is gone , " Nick said . " And no depositions could be taken . Did the package come in from Keifetz this morning ? " " Not yet . But you got ta give it another day . This is n't 1955 . They walk the mail in now . " " I ca n't explain it  --  but John Kullers knew he was going to be killed when he saw us find that rifle . " " We must find Miles . " Pa stared at him with great concern . " And suppose Miles is dead ? We 'll still have Fletcher 's deposition . But that is n't enough without the rifle . We ca n't go to the President with just that deposition . But what would we be going to the President for ? To persuade him to reopen an investigation . Until we find the rifle or find Miles we could start our own investigation . " Nick looked away from his father . He was in the oil business . Ile was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that threep88other people had died because they had seen the rifle meant that he might be killed himself . He just thought of the time it would take and the time he would have to spend with Pa that he could be spending with Yvette Malone . Then he thought of Kullers and Mr. Coney . They certainly had n't asked to be declared into this thing . They were dead because they happened to be standing in the wrong place , and , to a large extent , they were dead because of him . " People would talk to you because you 're Tim 's brother . They 'd talk to you because of me in other cases . You and me and Tim are a powerful combination , Nick , and I 'd give you as many trained men as you need . " The light on the switchboard turned on . Pa picked up the phone . He listened , then handed the phone to Nick . " It 's for you . A call from Brunei . " Nick took the phone . " Hello ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed into a twist of grief . " No ! " His legs seemed to give way . He leaned on the desk . " This is terrible . This is the worst . Daisy  --  Daisy , please  --  try to pull yourself together . Daisy , I know , I know  --  he was a fine man . But there was something he was trying to do and I have to know . What happened to the deposition and the fingerprints ? " He listened . At last he hung up . " Keifetz is dead , " he told Pa . " The lawyer who took the depositionis dead . The stenographer is dead . " " Is the deposition in the mail ? " Pa asked harshly . " No . It was with Keifetz . We are supposed to believe he fell off a rig and drowned . " " Then that 's the end of that . " " No , " Nick said grimly . " The deposition is only lost , Pa . Like the rifle . Somebody has them , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keifetz had been more of a father to him than Pa had ever been . Kullers was a total stranger , but he had been a valiant man , and his death somehow meant more to Nickthan Tim 's murder had . Life was all a thing of trying to makep89contact . He had made it with Keifetz and Kullers . It had eluded him with Pa and Tim , and no interminable talk about families could change that . He felt a need to avenge Keifetz . The same man had bought the deaths of all those people . He had bought a blood lust for Nick at last . To get the meeting over with so he could begin a manhunt , Nick asked Pa to have his agency people check out the National Rifle Association , to confirm that Fletcher had worked for them and to see if they had any fingerprints and photographs . " What else ? " " We ought to try as close a total comb-out of Texas as we can , to try to run down a trace of this Casper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you set a meeting for me with Z. K. Dawson ? " " Sure . When ? " " Anytime beginning tomorrow . I 'll be in New York . Either at the Walpole or at Butterfield 9-1845 . Meantime please tell me what you know about Dawson . He 's just a name to me . " " Z. K. Dawson is the richest man in Texas . He owned Eldridge Mosely . Eldridge was oil business in Pennsylvania , and Dawson was big oil business in Texas , Oklahoma and Colorado . In Saudi Arabia and Venezuela . In Algeria and the Gulf . He wanted Eldridgeto be President , but he had to settle for Vice-Presidentandyou know what John Garner said that was worth . But Dawson did n't see it that way . I say he had Tim killed to put Eldridge in the White House . He 's the greediest man we ever had in this country . " " You agree that he was probably one of the men who paid to have Tim killed ? " " He had the most reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . And he owned Eldridge Mosely . ... Who lives at Butterfield 9  --  1845 ? " " A girl . I 'll have to have Jake Lanham take over for Keifetz at I3runei . That means you have to put your people aboard the eekay right away so he can get off . " " I 'll handle it , " Pa said.  |p90THURSDAY  , JANUARY 31 , 1974NEW YORKNick caught a twelve ten plane to New York . He sat in a daze sipping cranberry juice and mourning Keifetz . He should have paid him more . Why was he so stingy with everything ? He remembered Keifetz ' uncle , an old dermatologist named Harry Lesion . Keifetz used to send the old man a hundred-dollar bill whenever he thought of it . He 'd have Daisy dig out the old man 's address , Nick decided , and send him the raise Keifetz should have had . He got to the family flat at the Walpole on upper Madison at a quarter to six . He took a bath , left a call for seven thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit as possible for an evening with Yvette Malone . Yvette Malone was a lightly bruised woman of about thirty who had been trampled by a man named Malone in holy matrimony and who had been fleeing ever since to almost anywhere it was emotionally comfortable , because a love of emotional comfort was all she had been able to salvage out of a marriage that had happenedten years before , when she had been even more defenseless . She had married one of those men who are retroactively determined to fly a Spitfire in the Battle of Britain or to become the leading climber of the Sherpa people for the first conquest of Everest or to pitch four consecutive no-hit games in the 1928 series against the Yankees  --  almost anything superlative if it were fictional or unattainable . He punished his wife for being denied these ambitions . After two years of doing the dishes for this prince of obscurity Yvette got out of town and moved to Paris . She divorced Malone . As contracted , Nick called from the lobby of the building at exactly eight o'clock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-eighth floor . They did n't speak much for the first hour  --  mostly there were grunts , moans , wails and shrieks . He threw himself at her , ran his hands up along her legs under her dress and grabbed everything that was waiting there . He scooped her upand ran down the short hall with her into a bedroom with a largep91bed . He threw her on it , then threw himself on top of her and began to flop about trying to kiss her and get out of his clothing while refusing to give up his hold on her crotch . She got his clothes off at about the same time he got hers off . It was fierce . It was poignant . It was noisy . And it was very , very carnal . As they were reaching a third climax he proposed to her . But he did it just before she moved into exultant chords of orgasm bellowing " Yes , yes , yes ! " to the extraordinary pleasure of the moment . He forgot she always responded just like that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Forty minutes later , while they were getting ready to sit down to dinner in the kitchen , as he opened a bottle of French wine she had smuggled in with her , he told her how happy she had made him by accepting his proposal so happily . " I do n't know what you mean , " she said . " I asked you to marry me , and you yelled yes ' three times . " " Nick , I could n't have . " " Why not ? " " Because I ca n't marry you . " " Why not ? " " Just because I ca n't , that 's all . " He put the bottle down with the corkscrew impaled in the cork . " I think I deserve more of an explanation than that . Have you met somebody else whom you 'd rather marry ? " he said stiffly . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , Nick . There is n't anybody else , and I 've cooked a very good dinner , and we can certainly talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Just answer one question . Do you refuse to marry me ? " " Yes . " " Ever ? " " Yes . " " Then I ca n't even stay here , much less eat your dinner . " " Well , I ' -n certainly glad you did n't propose the minute you got out of the elevator . At least we got something out of this evening . "  | " Listen , Yvette  --  you 've said about thirty times that you love me . You certainly act as if you love me . You certainly could n't be more sure that I loved you . Are you just generally against marriage because you had that one bad experience , or what is it ? " " I ca n't marry you , Nick . That 's all there is to say about it , and that 's all I 'm going to say about it . " As he started to protest , the telephone rang . Yvette answered it . " It 's for you , " she said . Baffled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nick ? Pa . You 're all set with Dawson . The house is on the Muskogee road , outside Tulsa . He 'll see you tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock . " " Thanks , Pa . " " Before you leave the Tulsa airport set the car 's odometer to zero , then drive out on the Muskogee road for one seven , point four miles . It 'll be a white house on the right-hand side . " " Does he know what I want to talk about ? " " He knows you 're in the oil business . He probably thinks it'sabout a deal . He 's an odd bird . He keeps fresh money in laundrysacks and runs all his meetings lying down in a dentist 's chair . " Nick hung up . " That was my father , " he told Yvette . " I 've heard of him , " she answered curtly . " Listen . What the hell is the matter with you ? I have n't seen you for almost five months , and it 's like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chop me down . " " Everything 's changed . " " What ? How ? " " I have to have time to think . " " What has changed ? What could possibly have changed ? I talked to you from London a couple of days ago and nothing had changed . " " I am not going to talk about it until I get it worked out . " " You are so going to talk about it ! I want to know what has changed ? " " If you force me to talk about it , I swear to you , Nick , that that could be the end of it for us . I do n't think I want it to be the end . "  |p93She  began to weep . " I know I do n't . But it 's hard . It 's very , very hard . " He walked to her and tried to put his arms around her . She moved away from him , eluding him . She said , " Please just sit down and eat this marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nick shouted . " How can I eat ? How can we sit here staring at each other and pushing food into our faces to keep from talking about whatever it is you wo n't talk about ? " He stalked out of the kitchen along the hall to the front door , grabbed his overcoat and hat and left , slamming the door . Yvette sobbed into her hands at the kitchen table , thinking about the lies Nick 's father had spread all over the world about her father.  |p94FRIDAY  , FEBRUARY 1 , 1974-TULSAThe weather was sunny and mild when Nick got to Tulsa . While he waited for his baggage to come up he called Ed Blenheim , who was out . Nick said he could call Blenheim again at about seven o'clock . The secretary gave him Blenheim 's home number . Nick picked up the rental car , set the odometer , and went out to find the Muskogee road . The white house was where it was supposed to be . It was a very modest house for a man with eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bottoms . It stood about a hundred feet off the road and looked as if they kept chickens out back . He rolled the car up the driveway . He checked the voiceactivatedrecording equipment he had stowed in the glove compartment . The meeting would be picked up through the microphonein Nick 's signet ring , then transmitted from the house to this recorder in the car . Pa thought of everything . Pa did n't own a big , rich Japanese electronics complex for nothing . As Nick got out of the car the front door of the house opened . A short fat-faced old man with a big belly and curvy white hair came out and asked Nick what he wanted . " I 'm Nick Thirkield . " " Who ? " " Tom Kegan 's son . " " All right . Come on in . " The old man did n't wait for him . He went back into the house and left the door open . Nick went in through the high-ceilinged hall . He entered the only open door . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his eyes closed . His stomach dominated the room . The old man was like a big fat bullfrog with the wearies . " Close the door and set down , " the old man said . Nick sat in an overstuffed Grand Rapids chair . The wallpaper was hideous . Cord was showing through different parts of the carpet . " What 's on your mind ? My boys tell me you got a small company but that you 're doin ' all right in the South China Sea . Do you need money for that Australian operation you got comin ' up ? "  | " Do I ? Have you heard anything ? " " No . I ai n't heard a thing . I 'd tell you if I had . But nobody 's goin ' to drill on that barrier reef in your lifetime . The pollution nuts took care of that . What can I do for you ? " Speaking very deliberately , Nick told the old man about Fletcher , and how he had found the rifle . He did n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finished , the old man lay on the chair as if he were asleep , his domed stomach rising and falling as he breathed . " That 's a funny goddam thing to come all this way to tell me about , " he said at last . " You are an extensive operator in the Southwest , " Nick said . " I wondered if you might remember a Dallas man named Casper or Casper Junior . " " I do n't think that 's exactly what you wanted to ask me . I think you 're trying to figure out a way to tell me you think I was the prime mover who got your brother shot . " Nick did n't answer . " A lot of people think that . Why , I do not know . You tell me . If you got any ideas on that subject , you tell me . I 'm a big producer in the war industries , and your brother was a politician who was hell-bent for war , and he could have doubled my for-tune . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first eleven months . " " He tried to get World War Three going over Berlin . He doubled , then he tripled the draft . He called up a hundred and fifty thousand reservists . He demanded that the Congress provide fallout shelters instantly while he ordered the development of a household-attack warning system . Your brother was reckless and irresponsible to an extreme degree , but I would n't have had him shot for that , because it was good for my business . Why , the Pentagon 's own study of the war in Vietnam concluded that your brother transformed what they called the limited risk gamble ' ofthe Eisenhower administration into a ' broad commitment ' ofp96American forces at war . Your brother was a crisis-eating President . That is the only way that kind knows how to convey the illusion that he is accomplishing something  --  which he was n't . " " You keep talking about his first eleven months . Everything changed after that . " Dawson chuckled . It sounded like oil bubbling in the earth at the bottom of a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jesus Christ , an awful lot of money was made out of that , but the more nonhuman the project , the more it appealed to your brother . But everything he did helped me , just the way it helped his daddy . Your brother was good for business . He was a helluva lot more conservative a President than Eisenhower . All his policieswere set to profit big businessmen . He was his daddy 's own true son , and I do n't have to tell you that they do n't come any more reactionary than that . Why would I shoot a man who kept thwarting the dreams of the niggers ? " " Only at the beginning . Only the beginning . " " That 's all there was , sonny . Only a beginning . He went to Berlin to say I am a Berliner , ' but he never went into the state of Mississippi and said I am a nigger . ' He was a token President with token policies , and he fooled ' em all most of the time . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law to abolish the oil depreciation allowance was purely horseshit . And the biggestbunch of horseshit was the bunch that got everybody convinced that your brother was antibusiness in every area  --  in taxes , wages , finances and federal spending . Take a look at his Medicare proposal , how he dragged his feet on civil rights legislation , the way he encouraged government contracting , and his whole yammerabout poverty at a time when just about ever'thing the poor needed was in surplus supply . And you have some crackpot idea that I had him shot ? Sonny , your brother reduced taxes by ten billion dollars in the short time he was in office . Your brother worked like a nigger to make the rich richer . He was a faker from the word go , but if we started going around to shoot the fakers , there would n't be enough bullets , sonny . So let 's let it go . I amp97seventy-nine years old , which means I 've outlived a lot of bubbleheadslike your brother . I never did give a holler about what people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who killed your brother . " " Who ? " " All that talk back at the time about me gettin ' your brother killed plain upset my daughter . And she 's a good old girl . So I hired me some sleuths and reminded a lot of people in Washingtonthat they owed me a few . We worked at it and we found out who did do the killing , then I showed the whole report to my little girl , and after she seen it I threw the whole thing into the fur-nace . " " Who killed him ? " " Now , your brother was a frivolous man . He did n't do much more for his country than help the rich and improve the social life in Washington . He did ever'thing off the top of his head , and he was an arrogant , cold-ass son-of-a-bitch . But you 're his brother , and that 's something like being a daughter when it comes to this kind of feelin ' . So I 'll get you started towards where you want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Philadelphia police killed him , " the old man said . " A man named Cap'n Frank Heller was in charge of the operation . Best thing for you to do is to talk to Cap'n Heller . " " He 's dead , Mr. Dawson . " The old man blinked . " Then try his sidekick , Lieutenant Ray Doty . They were the Philadelphia Special Squad , which was the Political Squad fourteen years ago . " The old man 's almost-round right hand , whose stubby fingers made it seem like a bear 's paw , dropped to the side of the chair and pushed a lever . The chair came full upright . He swung it around to face Nick . Stiffly he got out of the dentist 's chair . Nick stood up . He was herded toward the door . " Coin ' to Dallas , sonny ? " " No , sir . I have to sec a man in Tulsa about some oil business . "  | " Who 's that ? " " Ed Blenheim . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? " " I have a job for him in London . " " Where 'll you put up in Tulsa ? " " I do n't know yet . First time in Tulsa . " " Try the Gusher Motel at the airport . It 's a good clean place to stay even if I do own it myself . I 'll phone ahead and tell them to fix you up . " " Very kind of you . " The old man stood on the porch and watched Nick back the car down the driveway and out onto the Muskogee road.  |p99FRIDAY  , FEBRUARY 1 , 1974-MUSKOGEE ROADHalfway to Tulsa , ahead of Nick 's moving car about two hundred yards down the road in the approaching dusk , a car had been run off the road . A woman was standing on the highway near the wrecked car . She was trying to flag Nick 's down , waving a red-andbluescarf . He braked and stopped near her . She was a shockingly pale woman in her middle thirties with exquisitely sculpted features . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick asked , " Can I help you ? " thinking he had wandered into a James Bond movie , remembering old-time warnings about weird holdups he had read of in the old American Weekly at Harmonia , New York ; obliquely worrying that this might be some kind of Women 's Liberation attack in which other equally smashinglookingwomen would rush out from behind trees and bushes and would all gang-bang him . She had a voice with the texture of pecan pie . " If y'all would be kind enough to ride me down the road a piece so I can find a telephone back there at Jane Garnet 's Corners  --  " " Jump in , " he said . " A cab deliberately drove me off the road ! Ah swear they were hopheads . " " We 'd better find you a doctor . " " The proper thing is for us to introduce ourselves . " " How do you do ? " " I am Chantal Lamers . " " Happy to meet you . I am Nicholas Thirkield . " " Thoykeeld ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She slammed the door . " I 'm just dazed . I swear those men tried to drive straight into me . " It was getting dark . Nick switched the low beams on . After not more than five minutes of driving they came to a collection of buildings grouped around a gas station . Nick leaned out of the car and asked where they could find a doctor . The gas pumper pointed to the house next door . The woman got out of Nick 's carand ran inside , holding a handkerchief to her forehead.  | " She get hit by two weirdos wearin ' a 1967 Thunderbird ? " the gas pumper asked . " Man , they were flyin ' . Lemme tell you , they had eyes just like four sleepy rocks . " " Where 's the police ? " " Jessacrossa highway . " Nick crossed the road and made a report to a young trooper who called ahead to Muskogee to have a 1967 Thunderbird stopped . Then he needed a better description of the car and the victim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victimwas in the doctor 's office and he 'd send her over . When the woman came out she had a plaster on her head , but she did n't look as pale . " He gave me a big drink of grain alcohol , " she said happily . Nick took her to the young trooper and she completed all the forms . Her car was rented , and the trooper told her to refer the car-rental people to him . When they got back to Nick 's car Nick said he was on his way to the Gusher Motel at the airport and that he 'd be glad to drive her into Tulsa . She said the airport was exactly where she wanted to go . As they drove in she told him she had been visiting her parents in Muskogee , where her father ran the oldest pharmacy in town . She lived in New York , where she worked for the NationalMagazine . She was ticketed on a flight that would leave at six fifty-five . Nick said he was in Tulsa on oil business . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a drink , but she said no , because she 'd face a lot of red tape at the car-rental office and she had to check in at the flight counter . She thanked him earnestly , staring nearsightedly into his eyes , holding his forearms tightly . She was as tall as he was . She had deep black hair worn in a Dutch-boy cut . She had a strong , sensual , classic face . He decided she was an interesting-looking woman . Her mouth came together into one large , loose cushion . " If you ever come through New York I 'd love to have that drink with you , " she said . She wrote down her telephone number at the magazine office , explaining that they had a system thatbypassed the switchboard and went straight to her desk . She keptp101thanking him for his kindness . He stared at her legs as she walked away from him . Not since Yvette Malone had he seen legs like that . He arranged to have the rental car picked up at the Gusher Motel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked into room 1364 . He asked the bellman how they could have a number 1364 in a one-story motel . The bellman said the numbers started at 1351 because this one was part of a chain of motels which at the time the Gusher was built had 1350 rooms . Nick got no special greeting at the desk , so it was hard to say whether Mr. Dawson had bothered to tell them he was coming . There were still twenty minutes to wait before the time when he said he would call Ed Blenheim , so he settled down to read the local newspaper . Tulsa was an oil capital , so the paper was big with oil news . On the front page he read : GEOLOGIST SUICIDE IN EAST . Miles Gander had been found dead of monoxide poisoning in a closed car near Trenton , New Jersey . He dropped the paper . Miles Gander was dead from having agreed to have breakfast with a friend . He telephoned Pa . " Pa ? Miles is dead . " " I know . My people found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see Dawson ? " " Yes . " " What did he say ? " " He said the Philadelphia police organized Tim 's murder . The man in charge of it was Captain Heller . " " Our Captain Heller ? " " Who else ? Dawson said the man to talk to now is a police lieutenant named Ray Doty . Can you set me with him ? " " I 'll take care of it . " " I sure have a rotten feeling about Dawson . He even smells like death . " " Call inc in the morning for details on Doty . " Nick called room service and ordered some tea . When it arriveda small ginger cat wandered in with the waiter . Nickp102watched the cat scoot under the bed , but it was time to call Ed Blenheim . Blenheim could n't take the job because , to his absolute amazement , he had just , five minutes before , had a big surprise offer  --  which he had accepted  --  from Z. K. Dawson personally . " He just called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awed voice . " It 's raining big jobs today . " When Nick hung up , he felt a different kind of worse about Dawson . He poured himself a cup of tea , and because he never used milk or sugar , filled the saucer with the milk and put it on the floor next to the bed . The cat came out of hiding to lap at the milk . Sipping tea , Nick called his airline to make a reservation on an early-morning flight to Philadelphia . The reservation was confirmed for 8:5o A.M.At the periphery of his vision , Nick saw the small saucer of milk on the floor next to the leg of the bed . As he sipped the tea he looked down to watch the kitten lap it up . The kitten was dead . She was on her back with her eyes open , stretched taut , bent backward looking like a bow , in agony . But she was very dead . Nick emptied a bottle of aspirin tablets . Carefully he poured the meager amount of milk out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the bell captain to find him a roll of aluminum foil and some Scotch tape . The man said everything was closed . Nick surprised himself by saying he would pay ten dollars for it . It arrived in ten minutes . While he waited he changed his departure reservation to a flight leaving at nine fiftyfivethat night to Los Angeles . He called Si to tell him he would be coming in . Si told him a car would be waiting at the Palm Springs airport . It would be too late to use the chopper , he said , because the noise would wake up the boss . Nick wrapped the dead cat in thicknesses of aluminum foil and made the package secure with tape . He packed the cat into his attache case . He went to the motel restaurant , ordered a largesteak , even allowed the waiter to talk him into the doughnutsp103called " French fried onions , " and marveled that he felt both hungry and refreshed after someone had tried to murder him . The curtain was torn aside . He was frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would not have to pretend to carry on this feud of vengeance for Tim across fourteen years . He had to find the killer to stay alive , the best reason . Whoever it was he was pursuing  --  and it simply had to be Dawson  --  knew he was coming and feared him enough to try to kill him . That made whatever Nick would have to do all the clearer . He was accumulating evidence . He got to the Palm Springs fortress at eleven thirty-five . Pa was waiting for him in the " small " sitting room . " What happened ? " he asked irritably . " You 're due in Philadelphiafor lunch tomorrow with Doty . " " Dawson tried to kill me , Pa . " " When ? " Pa was confused . His aged , leather face offered new diagonal seams . " You called me after you left him , you said . " " He sent me to stay at the Gusher Motel  --  which he said he owns  --  then someone put poison in the milk intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wandered into the room  --  and that cat was dead in seconds . " " Poison ! " Pa spat out the word with contempt and disgust . " I poured it into a bottle and I wrapped the cat in aluminum foil . Let 's see what a lab says . Let 's find out if whatever killed the cat is the kind of stuff that would make Inspector Heller 's death look like a heart attack . " " You 're really right on top of this thing , Nick . " Pa looked at him as though he were seeing someone new . Pa also had a look on his face that said if they had poisoned Tim instead of shooting him he would n't have had much respect for Tim . " Well , anyway , " Nick said , " if the lab report checks out , we 'll have to ask for an autopsy on Heller . Maybe we have n't got much solid evidence now that Fletcher 's deposition and the rifle have disappeared . But we have one hclluva newspaper story that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea panicked Pa . He almost exploded with passion . " Absolutelynot , " he said so loudly that Nick knew he was suddenly frightened . " I 'm not going to barter Tim 's place in history with yellow journalism . We 've had enough **29;1029;TOOLONG this country . " He stared at Nick , breathing heavily . " You 've got to go out and dig up evidence . Real evidence . You have to do it . No one else can do it , and I 'll have the agency cover you with security men around the clock . " No . " Why not ? " " Because that might just stop somebody from trying to kill me when I 'd have the chance to grab him and hang onto him . " " Then you have to take a gun . " " No , Pa . I do n't even know how to use a gun . " " Then will you take a blackjack ? You do n't need lessons for that . " " Okay , I 'll take a blackjack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hit them . " " Okay , Pa . " " It 's my fright as much as it is yours . " " There is plenty to share , Pa . " " But we have to do it . We ca n't take this . I am proud of you , Nick . " " Do n't get sloppy , Pa . " " I ca n't believe that I once thought you were just another piano player . " " Pa  --  what was the agency able to find out about Lieutenant Doty ? "  |p105SATURDAY  , FEBRUARY 2 , 1974 -PHILADELPHIALieutenant Ray Doty was retired from the Philadelphia police department . He raised Cornish hens in Amalauk , New Jersey . He was eight years older than Frank Heller . They had been partners on the force since 1939 . They were both rough men . When the new mayor decided he needed a kind of task force to keep organizedcrime ( and other special problems ) in line in Philadelphia , he formed the Political Squad . Heller and Doty were it . Heller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugged muscle too . Doty was the hammer . Doty was sixty-eight years old when he agreed to meet Nicholas Thirkield in the restaurant of the Barclay Hotel . He was as slight a man as Heller had been thick and tubby . He was tall , skinnylooking , very strong and had bright red skin . He came complete with a cockade of stiff white hair worn in the style identified affectionately by Captain Heller as der Bi rstenhaarschnitt . His eyes , much like Captain Heller 's , had all the warmth of two set mousetraps . He smiled a lot , showing his teeth . Nick and Doty made a memorable lunch of snapper soup , imperial crab and pineapple chiffon pie . They also made small talk . " Tomorrow is Frank 's funeral , " Doty said . " I ca n't believe it . We were partners for thirty-five years . " " I met Captain Heller briefly , " Nick said . " Seemed like a very nice fellow . " " Was he on duty ? " " Yes . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different spirit , you might say , when he was on duty . We always had the roughest jobs . " " I bet . " " I been running a chicken farm for eight years , and , believe me , I ai n't relaxed yet . Not that I like it . You know  --  once a cop , always a cop . " The agency had paid Iieutenant Doty two thousand dollars totalk to Nick , and in the sense that it would probably be his lastp106big contract , he really wanted to give a money 's worth . But in the right way . The safe way . After lunch he took Nick into the manager 's office and frisked him for transmitting/recording devices , then they bundled up in heavy overcoats and went out to sit on a bench in the sun in Rittenhouse Square . There was no one nearer to them than sixty feet . ' There were no leaves on trees to conceal parabolic mikes . " Did the Philadelphia police set up my brother to be killed ? " Nick asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we had nothing to do with the killing . " " Who paid you ? " " I do n't know . They paid Frank , and Frank paid me . Frank said the less I knew about that the better  --  and he was right , of course . " You never knew anybody from their side ? " " I knew , yeah . One time  --  well , like a couple of times  --  we used my chicken ranch for meetings , because nobody could find it to bug it . It was always the same guy . A plump little guy with a bartender 's haircut . Short . Talked like a cowboy . " " But I mean  --  how did they come to you ? I mean , a stranger ca n't walk into the police department and ask them to cushion the murder of the President . " " Well , look  --  first it was n't the police department . It was the Political Squad . That was Frank and me and six men working three patrol cars when he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor talked to the advance man , and we had maybe two hundred and seventy cops assigned to us for the detail after that on a big job like a President . " " How did their man get to you ? " " He did n't get to us . He got to Joe Diamond . Joe knew everybody in the department and who did what and who took contracts , so the actual work was like all organized through Joe , thenp107Joe called us in to like routine everything and handle the Cush-ion . " " How ? Tell me how it was done , " Nick said . " Before anybody could get anything done they had to talk it over with Frank . You got ta understand that . "  |p108SATURDAY  , NOVEMBER 28 , 1959 -PHILADELPHIACaptain Heller 's wife 's name was Myrtle . She was a merry-faced woman whose rosy cheeks came from making so many of Mom 's Zimsterne and Schwabenbrotle for her master and her seven children  --  Hans , Franz , Fritz and Wolfie , and Kathe , Klare , and Katherina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Klan in school . In the Philadelphia police department the Heller house was known as Little Germany . The house was in Philadelphia 's Germantown section . Years before , Captain Heller had trained his non-German wife to set a Swabian table . After years of work with her , he considered that her Fiddle were superior to his mother 's , her Schwarzwalder Kartoffelsuppe not yet as good as his mother 's . However , no one , not anyone , could equal her Maultaschen . And she scraped his Spatzle from the board by hand as per the high ruling of the Stuttgart Municipal Restaurant Council . She knew as much about making Spatzle as his grandmother ! At home Captain Heller spoke German to his children , English to his wife . The family drove in three Volkswagens ( and on one Honda ) , one of which Myrtle was intent on borrowing for the evening on behalf of her son Wolfie when she put her head in at the door of Captain Heller 's study , with its ancient , black , enormous furniture , carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Heller 's grandfather eightysevenyears before and which left very little circulating space in the small room . There were only four pictures on the walls of the study : a mezzotint portrait of Richard Wagner by the Munchen Master G. Bocca ; a signed photograph of Feldmarschall August von Mackensen at the Heldengedenktag ceremonies with Adolf Hitler ; a portrait of the German Crown Prince , and one of GeneralVon Blomberg . There was a fading typewritten record of the statement made that day ( dated March 1 ' 7 , 1935 ) by General Von Blomberg pasted at the bottom of the photograph : " It was the Army , removed from the political conflict , which laid the foundationson which a God-sent architect could build . Then this manp109came , the man who , with his strength of will and spiritual power , prepared for our dissensions the end they deserved and made all good where a whole generation had failed . " The third wall decorationwas a small painting of Ernestine Schumann-Heink by Shannon-Philipsin the costume for Ortrud in Lohengrin . Beneath it on the wall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , executed in needlepoint . This was the work of Captain Heller . It had taken him thirty-seven months to complete , working twenty-two stitches to the inch . " There 's a man at the door , " Myrtle said . " His name is WilliamCasper . And can Wolfie have the car tonight ? " " Ach , " Heller rumbled . " I should have told you he was coming . Do we have schnecken for the coffee ? " He did not mind English to his wife in his own house , because he loved her and had forgiven her for having been born of Scottish people in Pittsburgh . " As commanded , " Myrtle said , " we have the standard minimum of nine schnecken . " " And fresh coffee ? " " You and your guest will be issued two cups of fresh coffee each , as per regulations of this house . You can sign for them in the morning . " Heller frowned . He did not understand why she always joked about the coffee and the schnecken . " Send William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . " The keys to the white Volkswagen , please . " " The white ? Why the white ? It is the second newest . And I do n't like the way Wolfie steers . He has not smoothness . He is abrupt with the wheel . " " Wolfie has changed his driving style altogether , " Myrtle said . The captain found the car keys in the drawer and handed them over . " Tell them nobody leaves for their dates until I am finished with this man . "  | " They know , Frank . Believe me , they know . " She patted his cheek and left the room . Very shortly afterward William Casper knocked at the door and came in . " Cappen Heller ? " " Come in , sir . Close the door . " Heller got up from behind the desk , walked to Casper and said , " Put your hands against the wall and lean into them . " " What the hell for ? " " We have voice prints now . We will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we talk with total security . " Casper leaned , and Captain Heller frisked him . Then he held a chair for Casper and returned to his own chair behind the desk and started the recorder with his knee . " Coffee is coming . Do you take schnapps with the coffee ? " " What is schnapps ? " " Whiskey . " " Oh , snaps . Sure , I take a snaps now and then . " " We will not talk business until the coffee comes . " " Sure is cold up here . " He saw the instantly offended expression on Heller 's face and quickly amended that . " Not in here . Up here . In Philly . " Myrtle came in with the loaded-down tray . Captain Heller pulled up a bottle of bourbon from behind him and laced the coffee with it . Myrtle left . As she opened the door , from down the hall and from up the stairs came the voice of Buddy Holly screaming a song of ruined young love , but decently far enough away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells blended with the whiskey smells and the bouquets of bay rum and witch hazel that rose from Mr. Casper . " Now we will talk , " Heller announced . " You seen Diamond ? " " He told me . " " But you did n't say you was on . " " I talk my own money . Nothing is settled until the money isp111settled . And I am aaaalzzo speaking for the share of my partner , Lieutenant Doty . " Within otherwise wholly native American speech , which had been formed in Dover , New Jersey , Captain Heller always pronounced the word as " aaalzzo , " one of his few lapses ( in speech habits ) . " We want to buy your experience , Cappen . " " And my protection . " " Thass right . " " One thing must be clear . Everything must be done only from my plan . From the plan I will lay out . " " Well , sure . " Heller grunted . He could grunt like a Westphalian blue-ribbon boar weighing in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How much ? " he asked . " Remember , when I give you a figure , it is cash . " " Did you think a thing like this could go on the American Express ? " " My boss will go all the way to twelve thousand , five hundred . " " Then forget it . " " That is a big piece of money for a morning 's work . " " A morning 's work ? How long do you think they take to hang you , my friend ? How long it takes for the rope to break your neck , that is only how long is the work that goes into this . " " Well  --  I do n't know  --  I might be able to get an okay for twenty thousand . " " I will now tell you what you will pay . Fifty thousand . Try the schnecken . " He pushed the plate toward Casper . " My wife makes them herself . You will faint , it is so delicious . " " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking a schnecke into three pieces and tasting one of them . " God damn , " he said with delight . " Man , that is good ! " Having gone through enough of the motions of driving a hard bargain , Casper was no longer interested in pretending to haggle . The price had been set . " Okay , Cappen , fifty thousand . " " Half now . "  |p112Mr  . Casper took a large brown manila envelope out of his side pocket . He took a sheaf of banknotes out of it and counted out twenty-five thousand dollars slowly in one-thousand-dollar bills . His lips moved silently . He pushed the money across the table to the captain , who recounted it rapidly , opened the top drawer of his desk , dropped the money in and locked the drawer . " When does he come to Philadelphia ? " he asked . " Washin'ton 's birthday . Two-two Feb . Gives us about eleven weeks . Say  --  how does she make these buns ? " " The pure , sweetened yeast dough is sprinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sugar sheet , then rolled into snail shapes and baked in brown sugar and honey . " He was very pleased that Casper had asked the question . " You mean his own people are setting him up ? " " Well , we got ta get him here , do n't we ? " " I will see Joe tonight . " " Then that 's all , then . " Casper stood up . " Please pay the second half of the money , into my hand , in this house , on the morning of the day the work is going to be done . Or nothing happens . " " Fair enough . " Heller escorted Casper to the front door and helped him on with his coat . They shook hands . Casper left . Heller turned into the house as a patrol car rounded a corner to drive sedately and at a discreet distance behind Mr. Casper 's car . " Wolfie ! " Captain Heller bellowed . A young man of nineteen appeared instantly from a room off the hall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight ? " " I am taking the girls to the Bingo , " he said in German . " Of course . You want the car to help your sisters . Where will you go with it when you leave them off ? " " I have a date . With Harriet Wilmerding . " " A good family . But , aaalzzo the Volkswagen is from a good family . "  | " Yes , Poppa . " " Take care ! " his father barked . Captain Heller marched past his son into the parlor , where his sons and daughters were waiting in two rows . He glared at them over the great pouches of blackness under his eyes , because the girls had their hats on . " All right ! " he said in German in a parade-ground voice . " It is Saturday night . You have done good work all week , and now you play . " They all smiled . " But there is bad weather out there tonight , so you must take care . Tonight the girls will return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz and Wolfie will come home at twelve thirty . Hans and Franz at one o'clock . Remember ! I will be waiting . " He stood at the door , kissed each one as they went past and gave each one a secret sum of money . After they had gone he settled down with Myrtle in the crowded study and concentrated on his needlepoint . At twenty minutes to eleven he said that Doty would arrive to pick him up in six minutes . " Will you be late ? " " I will be home at twelve twenty . " " If you are having a good time , " she said , smiling , " make it twelve twenty-two . Just give a shout as you cross the threshold so I can set the clocks by you . " He drew a chair close to her and kissed her ear . " Why are you always making fun of me ? " he whispered . " Because it gives you tremendous pleasure . " " You know too much , " he said with a heavy German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of his house the moment Lieutenant Doty sounded his horn . They sat in the car while Heller counted out eight one-thousand-dollar bills and gave them to Doty . They were wearing civilian clothes . " You owe me five hundred dollars change , " Heller said . " Hepaid twenty-five up front . I get fifteen . You get seventy-five hun/dred . Then four hundred apiece for the patrol-car boys  --  it cheats them out of about sixteen bucks apiece but maybe you 'll need it for your chickens . " " That 's sure as hell great with me , " Doty said . " You are sure that 's okay ? You think that is eminently fair ? " " One hundred percent , Frank . " " Good . Aaalzzo there is another twenty-five due when the show gets to town . " " Same split ? " " Correct . " " Sensational . " " Now we go to Diamond 's saloon . " Doty moved the black police car downtown . Joe Diamond 's saloon was called the Casino Latino . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smaller room that Diamondcalled the nightclub . It was very dark in there . A piano played all the time . Out at the center of the bulked tobacco smoke four girls took turns stripping every now and then . When they had finished they went back to sit with the customers . Joe kept a king-sized mattress on the floor in a pantry behind the kitchen for any cop who wanted to get laid . But only cops . He was n't running any joint . Most of the cops preferred to stay in the big lighted barroom . It was both a club and a bourse for the Philadelphiapolice . It was the favorite club , because policemen known to Joe ( which was 86.3 percent of the entire force ) got a check for only every second round of drinks . All grades spent their off-hours at Joe 's . It was only two blocks from police headquarters , but also precinct men from every section of the city showed up there throughout the day and night to set contracts . For example , if a citizen wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casino Latino , talk his problem over with Joe , and Joe would cast the right cop for the job . If an out-of-town dealer wanted to set up an operating base at a new school andhousing development in the suburbs , he would buy his heroinp115from Joe , as a wholesaler , but Joe would set the okays to operate from the police in the new district , who would be represented at the Casino Latino . The waiters handled crap like traffic tickets and summonses . Joe Diamond , who had made it all possible for citizen and law-enforcement officer alike , had two great love affairs with life : money and policemen . He was sexually hung up on both . He just  --  well , he liked the way they smelled . He liked to grip them tightly . He liked to pack money and policemen in a crowded room and rub against them as he moved around . He patted young cops on the face when they were very clever . There were three young cops who were so low on the pole that he goosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up instantly by buying them drinks . He knew the cops who would kill for the right money . He knew the cops who would steal for him if the setup was right . He knew the plain gorillas . He had respect for one policeman . He was frightenedof one policeman . When he lay in bed in the dark wondering if he wanted to go to sleep , his reveries were conscious dreams about Captain Heller . Captain Heller ( and by association , Lieutenant Doty ) , was to Joe Diamond the most policeman that existed anywhere to a man who knew himself to be a connoisseur of policemen . Captain Heller was the Political Squad , accountable to nobody but the commissioner ( who was a politician ) . Only Joe Diamond and a few dozen dead guys knew Heller was there . The work of the Political Squad was so tricky that Frank Heller had to be the best operating cop in the United States just to be chosen to handle work like that . But if Heller was Joe 's hero , Joe was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same . He was good for a touch of up to a hundred dollars for only five percent a week , but he would n't lend more than that , because it made bad friendships in the end if he had to turn the guys in for nonpayment . He got the cops a better than fair share of all the narcotics business in the city . Whoever was in vice or stolen goods or retail extortion had a callp116from Joe the week he started in business , and honorable and convenient arrangements were made to pay off both the precinct and downtown . Joe ran a string of about a dozen , sometimes up to twenty , call girls . He cheated them whenever he could , because he hated women who could go into a business like that . He insisted that they put out to cops for nothing , and he heat them up if they refused . He also insisted on absolutely clean underwear . If a girl went out on a date with dirty underwear and he asked the customerabout how was her underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl unconscious , because every one of those girls knew how he felt about that . Class showed , he explained to them vociferously , in little things like that . Joe Diamond was a dumpy man with an oatmeal face and four gold front teeth . Other than that he was easily as good-looking as a basket full of assholes . He was a sharp dresser . He took care of his hair . He shaved twice a day . He smoked thirty-five-cent cigars . He knew abortionists and clap doctors , and if a cop did n't have the money , he made the cop let him pay for it . He had operated the Casino Latino for eight years , and it had been an important place from the start . Joe was an overachiever about making people understand that he was afraid of absolutely nothing and nobody . He re-established that two or three times every night in a loud voice . He was his own bouncer . Everybody knew he carried a piece in an ankle holster , which was why he walked with a gimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was very big about saying who he knew in New York and Cleveland , in Vegas and Miami . You asked Joe for something and he delivered . If he could n't  --  well , he did n't . That was Joe  --  a very butch fag . He had his faults , certainly . He deducted for social security and withholding from his people , but he did n't pay it in . If he was a sadist , it was because that was what anybody was quick to call anybody who beat up on women in public . But what the hell . He was a helluva guy , if he said so himself . He believed inpalsmanship , and if he did n't drink with you , it was n't becausep117he did n't like you , it was because he had a lot of blood sugar and had to be careful . Heller and Doty sat in a far corner of the big barroom , and everybody gave them plenty of room . Captain Heller was well known not to be a fraternizer and showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rye and ginger ale  --  just enough to keep the lips moist . Joe was making his rounds of the tables , copping a feel wherever he could . He had n't seen them come in and they did n't send for him , but when he saw them he ran to their table . " Welcome to my place , Captain , " Joe said . " Hello , Lieutenant . Are they taking good care of you ? " " We 'll be in the square in twenty minutes , " Doty told him . Joe told a couple of jokes . Nobody laughed . He fought to buy them another round of drinks until Doty told him to get the hell out of there . Heller and Doty left the saloon and drove to the south side of Rittenhouse Square . Ten minutes later Joe got into the back seat beside Captain Heller . He told himself he would give his life if he could have Doty 's job for one year . " Casper is all settled , " Heller said . " Oh , great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work . First and foremost  --  who takes the fall ? " " I have a guy in mind , if that is gon na be any help to you . It is strictly none of my business , I am just the middleman here , but this is a kid you wo n't believe for this job . This kid spent two years in Poland  --  after he got outta the Marines  --  and in Poland , in the capital of Poland , he went to the American Embassy and said he wanted to be a Polish citizen . " " He 's a Commie ? " Doty asked incredulously . " What else ? Also a Marine . Also very stupid . " " Why do you think he would want to work on this ? " " He is a Cuba nut . He hands out leaflets on Market Streetevery weekend . I Ic thinks Kegan is oppressing Cuba . " " What 's his name ? " I Idler asked  | " His name is Willie Arnold . " " Check him out , " Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does ? " Diamond asked rhetorically . " This kid pushes shit in his spare time , and he sends the money he makes to Cuba . " " If he checks out , " Heller said , " we 'll pick him up . Then he 'll go to you to fix it , and we 'll have a little lock on him . " " Okay . " " Now , who do you have for an alternate ? " " We need an alternate , " Doty said . " The natural is the shooter they are bringing up from Texas , " Diamond said . " In fact , there is n't anybody else . " " They 're bringing a man all the way up from Texas ? " Heller said . " When will he be here ? " " He 's not a racket guy . Just some farmer . Casper said he would bring him here like a week ahead of the date . " " Call Ray when you know , " Heller said . " That 's all . Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanking his friends . They left him in mid-sentence and drove away . Heller looked at his watch . " This is great . I can be home and sitting in the parlor before the girls get home . Step on it , Ray . " Three nights later Captain Heller sent word to Diamond that he wanted to see Casper at his house . When he had frisked Casper , when the coffee and schnecken came in and Myrtle had left , Captain Heller said he had developed his plan . Casper held up his hand . " I do n't know nothing about plans and I do n't want to know . We got to keep this thing compartmentalized . My job was to contact Joe Diamond , then , later on , to bring the shooter to him . My other job was to make the money deals . The way I see it , the best thing is if you tell the whole plan to Joe Diamond , so he can deliver the shooter to where he 's supposed to be . The fewer people who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you one hundred percent , " Heller said.  |p119FEBRUARY  17 , 1960-AMALAUK , NEW JERSEYThe night before Casper brought Turk Fletcher to Philadelphia , Heller , Doty and Diamond had a meeting at Doty 's chicken ranch . They sat around the kitchen table with their hats on . Doty mixed chicken feed while they were talking . " This is the last meeting , Joe . All right . This is the drill . He will be on his way through the city to the Liberty Bell . I take him up Market Street , then we snake around through Hunt Plaza as if we were going under the railway bridge . There are a lot of good things about this route . The Texas shooter will have good elevationfrom the Engelson Building . Here are two sets of keys to Room 603 , where he will work . He should be planted there by about half past nine in the morning . Ray will work out the details with you and how we 'll want to deliver him . Aaallzzo , Hunt Plaza is good , because Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a cheap rifle , which you will have Arnold plant in the TV Center room on the top floor overlooking the plaza . And some cartridges for him to throw on the floor . Ray gives you the details . After the hit and after we have established him in the building , tell him to go home and wait there in case we need him . If we need him we 'll send a patrol car for him . Tell him nobody gets paid until the job is all over . Ray gives you the details . " He stared heavily at Diamond . " And you know what you do  --  right , Joe ? " " Yeah . I know , " Joe mumbled . " There were a lot of things to consider here , " Heller said by way of apology.  |p120SATURDAY  , FEBRUARY 2 , 1974 PHILADELPHIA " And that 's it , " Lieutenant Doty said on the bench with Nick in Rittenhouse Square . " Frank was just a born leader . " " How did they find Diamond ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It figures they were passed along by the Mob . Diamond was with them in Cleveland and Chicago and Detroit  --  a long time . " " Lieutenant  --  I was with Heller the day we found the rifle . Where 's the rifle ? " " He never said nothing to me , Mr. Thirkield . " " But you know how his mind worked . He did n't take the rifle to the lab . Where would he go with it ? " " I think he would put it away somewhere , then he would contact Casper to sell him the rifle . " " He knew where to find Casper ? " " He did n't say so . But I bet he had Casper tailed back to his own house in Texas . Waste not , want not was Frank 's motto . He was always saying , If you 're always ready , you 're always glad . ' " " Who did Casper work for ? " " Frank never said . " " Did he have any ideas ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He said Joe Diamond was the first man in . He thought it was probably a Syndicate hit . " " He believed that ? He believed the Mafia would want to kill the President ? " " What the hell  --  that 's their business , is n't it ? " " But  --  why ? " " How do I know ? But we once heard a very big Syndicate man say Kegan took a two-million-dollar campaign contribution from the boys and then never did anything for it . " " That just is n't possible . " " Look  --  Kegan could have been hit by anybody . There were ap121lot of grudges flying . We think the Mob did it . But whoever did it still has one terrific amount of clout fourteen years after it happened . It was good to see you , Mr. Thirkield . Good luck . " Doty got up from the bench and walked rapidly away . Nick went back to the Petroleum Club to call his father . Pa got on the phone . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead cat and that poisoned milk to Standard Laboratoriesin Glendale . I just got the report back . " " What kind of poison kills that fast ? " " We 're up against some real pros . If you had n't brought that cat , they could never have figured out what killed it . " " Why ? " " Why ? The milk shows no poison . How about that ? But the cat had a terrific immunological reaction . It died from  --  wait , I got ta read this off  --  anaphylactic shock . So they went back to the milk and isolated foreign matter , which turned out to be about four drops of red pigment of a guinea pig 's blood . It would have turned you bright blue . " " Maybe they got that into Heller . " " Maybe . " " But he died in his own house . " " First we have to find out if that 's how Heller died . I talked to Fritz Frey . He is going to try to clear an autopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did you see Doty ? " " I just left him . Heller set Tim up for the murder . Pa , I think I might have a hunch where Heller put that rifle . I may even have a hunch who killed him . " " Who ? " " He probably tried to sell them the rifle , and they agreed to talk about it , and they went to his house . He has a real coffee ritual for visitors . Maybe they put the stuff in his coffee . " " And maybe the rifle is right there ? "  | " Right . Will you call Frey again and say I have this hunch and ask him to send me a reliable man to go with me to get it if it 's still there ? " " I 'll call him right now , " Pa said . " Stay where you are . " In twenty minutes the front desk called to say the police commissionerwas waiting downstairs . The commissioner was sitting in a large limousine . Nick got in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traffic . Nick said , " I did n't mean to get you out , Commissioner . This is only a hunch . " " Where is the hunch ? " " It may sound simple-minded , but Heller was such an intense family man , I am guessing that the only place he would think the rifle would be safe would be in his own house . " Frey looked at Nick blankly for a moment , then he said , " That 's right . " He told the driver where to take them and told him to use the siren . When the car pulled up in front of Little Germany , Frey asked Nick to wait in the car . " This is going to be a delicate and personal visit with Myrtle Heller as well as being a police call . " Myrtle greeted him warmly . She took him to the kitchen , which was the largest room in the house . She poured him a cup of coffee , put a schnecke on a plate and set it in front of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You smoke too many cigars . " " I never light ' em . " " But the juices . Who would have thought it would be his heart ? Two weeks ago he had a department checkup and the doctor said he had the heart of a twenty-five-year-old . " " Myrtle , look ... " " What 's the matter ? " " It might not have been his heart . " " But the doctor said it was his heart . " " We have some new evidence . I mean there 's a chance that  --  well , I have to say it to you  --  Frank could have been poisoned . "  | " Poisoned ? In his own house ? " " Did anyone come to see him that night ? " " A woman was here . Just a routine call , Frank said . I showed her in . I brought them some coffee . " " Do you remember her name ? " " I remember everything about that night . I always will . She said her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in a lineup ? " " I 'm sure I could . She was a pretty woman about thirty-five , but she had silver hair . " " Did Frank keep any records of his meetings here ? " She smiled proudly . " No one kept such meticulous records as Frank . He taped every phone call . And he taped every meeting , then he filed it all away  --  why , you ca n't imagine . Come in here with me . " Myrtle led the way to Captain Heller 's study . She went to a long filing box on his desk . " This is just the card file for meeting tapes , " she said . " You should see the boxes with the card files to locate the telephone-call tapes . " She opened the box . " Go ahead . Look up Casper . It 'll be there . " Frey riffled through the cards . There was one Casper card with three entries . It said : CASPER , WILLIAM  --  Dallas ( ? ) Texas . Five feet seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . Contempt for money . Recorded : November 28 , 1959 . No. 1364December 1 , 1959 . No. 1371February 18 , 196o . No. 1409 Code PMyrtle was looking over Frey 's shoulder . " I do n't know what ' Code P ' means , " she said . Frey thought silently that it probably stood for " payoff . " There was no card for Mrs. Casper . " It could be the did n't have time to make out a card for Mrs. Casper , " Frey said . ' That would mean the tape is still in the machine , " Myrtlep124said . She went to the window seat behind Heller 's desk and opened a large walnut cigar box . There was a four-track cassette recorder fitted inside it . Frey leaned on the EJECT button . A cassette popped out . Written on the cassette was " MRS . WILLIAMCASPER . " " I 'll have to take this along with me , Myrtle . " " What is happening ? " " I came here myself this morning because we have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do trust you , Fritz . " " We want your permission to conduct an autopsy . " She looked at him helplessly . " It wo n't delay the funeral , " Frey said . " We can have it done this afternoon , and he can be back at the funeral parlor tonight . " " Is it police business ? " He nodded . " If he was poisoned . " " Do I sign something ? " Frey took the papers from his pocket and a large black fountain pen . She signed without reading the paper . " Do n't let my kids know about this , Fritz . " " Not if I can help it . " " That 's right . " They walked toward the front door . " We 're talking about moving to Arizona , " Myrtle said . " The kids want it . " " Year-round sunshine . " " Frank is all over this place , except he is n't here . " " He was a man . " " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there 's just one other thing . I wonder if I could pick up the rifle Frank brought home last Wednesday ? They need it down at the lab . " She looked at him oddly . " Do n't you remember , Fritz ? You sent for it Thursday morning . " " The rifle ? "  | " It was a patrol-car cop . A skinny little guy named Marek , with a weak handshake . " They stared at each other . " Fritz  --  did I do wrong to let him take the rifle ? " With Nick , Frey played back the cassette tape at police headquarters . HELLER : Come in . Shut the door . Hands against the wall , please . Lean on the hands . . . . Sit down here please ... .

Nick asked for a copy of the tape , then the Commissioner asked if Heller and the woman had been talking about what he thought they were talking about . " They were haggling over the price for the rifle used to murder my brother , Commissioner Frey . " " That 's what I thought , " Frey said sadly . " Frank finally overpricedhimself .

When he got there it was a wet , cold winter evening . He was baffled by the emergence of a Mrs. Casper who had left the antilife substance in Heller 's coffee . Just by showing up out of nowhere she had widened the inquiry . He had to pass all of this along to Pa for Professor Cerutti , Pa 's house mastermind . There were many more people than taxis at Penn Station . He did not have the courage to roam the streets looking for a cab . He waited for ten minutes before he understood that he was going to have to fight for a cab to get one . He fought off three men ( who had body-blocked two women ) , made it into a cab , slammed the door and locked it instantly . There was no thought in anyone 's mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because everyonethere knew that everyone else there was probably a homicidal maniac who carried a concealed ice pick that would flash out and pin the cab-sharer 's heart to the back of the seat . The driver , locked inside a steel compartment behind the wheel , did n't want to know who rode , who killed whom or who did n't . Everything but the street traffic hurried across the funeral parlor of the western world in taut silence and with frightened faces . Even with the doors locked and a good grip on the blackjack bestowed by his father , Nick sweated out the passage to the protected inner zone of the city , where no junkies were permitted to wander around unless they had an assured source of supply . He felt locked in the ultimate stasis on concentric levels of self and civilization . He responded against the savagery and the threat of the city automatically : he moved out within his mind to defy his father . To throw off the threat of collective insanity from the most dangerous place in the world he hacked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lc was n't aware of how his mind was reacting , but Nick was so committed to impressing Pa with his intelligence and efficiency , his daring and skill , that Ile compromised iii his mind withp128what his father had not wanted him to do , telling himself he had to do it to get results , that there was no other way : he decided to bring the press into the investigation . He was certain that he could make a written agreement with them at the outset that would control them . He reasoned that he would be able to control them until Pa could be brought to see why the cooperation of the press was necessary and give his permission to let them publish . Nick decided he could negotiate press assistance on a copyright basis . It would be his story . He would lease the story to them with explicit conditions . He had to do it , he told himself . Lieutenant Doty had said the Syndicate had found Joe Diamond for whoever had paid to have Tim killed . Nick had only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was another way of saying " Mafia " and labelingorganized crime . If the Syndicate had agreed to provide a man to do the killing , then it followed that they knew who had asked them to find the killer . As impenetrable as the situation had seemed a few hours before , he now saw that all he had to do was to find a way to reach the Syndicate , whatever that might be . The press knew such people . Until the woman from the National Magazine had had her car accident , Nick had n't known any part of the press , but he knew someone now . Mr. Zendt , the managing director of Pa 's hotel , took Nick personally to the family apartment , a three-story penthouse in the tower of the hotel . It was an extraordinary apartment at the very center of the mire of twenty-five million people and all of their lights . And Pa believed in comfort most after matters of money and power had been settled . The colors of the apartment soothed : muted ivory against pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room that was three stories tall ; a dining room , library , a large foyer and kitchen on the main floor ; four bedrooms , four baths and two studies on the upper floors . The first-floor study , with blue walls and white woodwork , had another installation of Pa 's replicas of the White House telephone system , by which , hebragged , he could reach anyone in the world who was lolling aboutp129near their phone within six minutes . Pa had stolen all the records and systems of the White House switchboard , including every public , private and hideout telephone number of some six thousandpeople in the world . Pa bragged that he could reach the Metropolitan of the Russian Church during Mass through a phone in the tabernacle . Nick knew that as soon as he arrived at the desk in the lobby of the hotel Pa would be flashed on the special equipment so that he could know Nick was in residence in New York . " Information is the key to everything , " Pa taught . The thought made Nick sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he supposing ? Of course Pa would have it bugged . That meant ( a ) no meetings with the press at the apartment and ( b ) he would be crazy to invite Yvette Malone up into one these bedrooms , because she was so operatically vocal in the sack . Therefore , when Mr. Zendt asked whether Nick would like to have a cook while he was in residence , Nick declined ; no entertaining . God , what a waste , he thought . A man came to unpack him and to take out his clothes to be pressed . Two chambermaids turned down the beds in Tim 's beige and brown room , which had one green velvet chair and one green leather chair into which Pa had had screwed commemorative tabs establishing that Tim had sat in his own two chairs . Nick put in a call to Jake Lanham in Brunei . While he waited for it , he walked aimlessly around the room , staring out at the rare beauty of the city when seen at night from a height of seven hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in buildings in which Pa stayed , because he had the foresight to own everything . He called down for a bottle of Montrachet ' 59 , a dry white wine of which the Vicomte Henri d'Emmethad said it caused one " to be drunk on one 's knees , with the head bared , " but of which the Vicomtesse d'Emmet ( to some the greater authority ) had recorded , " Very great , but the very best makes t he veins swell like whipcord . " By the tune he had spoken to Jake I  --  uthaln he had drunk ap130third of the bottle and felt himself to be one-third wider and one-half longer . Jake was willing to stay on , managing Brunei , with a 20 percent raise ( less than Nick had paid Keifetz ) . Then Lanham said that Keifetz had died thirty-five hundred dollars light in petty cash . Gulping , Nick said that was " all right . " He was thinking of asking Lanham if he 'd like to take Carswell 's job in London , but after hearing news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite so much . After another glass of wine he could n't stand being separated from Yvette Malone any longer , so he called her . Maddeningly , she was not at her apartment . He told her answering service to tell her to call him . If she did n't want to get married , what the hell , they would n't get married . He sipped at the wine , then hoping it was n't too late for magazine office hours  --  but it was the only way he knew to reach her  --  he suddenly called Chantal Lamers at her desk number at the National Magazine . Chantal Lamers was happy  --  he was even willing to estimate that she was very happy to hear from him . She would be stimulatedand delighted to have dinner with him . They agreed on the Canopy for eight thirty , just about two hours ahead . The moment he disconnected , the switchboard flashed again . It was Pa . " What are you doing in New York ? " Pa asked . " I wanted to see a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know her . " " Oh . A friend . Well , the agency confirms that Turk Fletcher worked for the National Rifle Association , and they will get us photographs of him . No line on Casper in Dallas . Did you know your pal Keifetz clipped us for thirty-five hundred bucks ? " " How did you know that ? " Nick gasped . " I keep in touch , kid . " " Well , Keifetz did n't clip anybody . I authorized the with-drawal . " " Like hell you did . " Pa hung up . Nick felt himself swelling up with rage , although it was probably the Vicomtesse d'Emmet'sp131prognosis for people who drank too much Montrachet . He called down for a car and driver to pick him up at eight fifteen . He thought of ordering a car to pick up Chantal Lamers , but he decided he did n't know her well enough . He felt a little drunk . He decided to take hot and cold showers . He thought about sending out for some tanked oxygen or maybe some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were going to maintain control of the press . He started for the stairway to go to the upstairs bedroom when the doorbell rang . He shook his head , took a deep breath and went to the door . He opened it on a large , bulky man wearing a Chesterfield overcoat , a blue woolen scarf and a bowler hat who was pointing a pistol at his stomach . The man jabbed the barrel of the pistol into him and backed him across the entrance hall , kicking the door shut behind him . " Do n't talk , " the beef-cheeked man said . " There is nothing to talk about . You are going out that window . " He had a pronounced British accent . Nick leaped to the wall at his right . He pressed the alarm button that the Secret Service had installed for Tim within the columns of the decorative paneling . Rapid bells and heavy gongs began sounding simultaneously . A full-throated siren began to moan . The bulky man took his eyes off Nick in astonished panic , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to thrust him out the window . Nick threw a bronze bookend from a recessed shelf . It struck the man at the side of his bowler hat and sent him staggering backward into the wall . Nick lunged for the man 's gun wrist , holding it with both hands , forcing it downward . The man dropped the gun and hit Nick heavily in the face with a long , left-side swing , then dropped him to his knees , screaming , by applying deep pressure with his powerful left hand to a nerve terminal in Nick 's elbow . Nick let go the man 's wrist . The man kicked him in the right temple , spun around , opened the front door through all the noises of the alarms , and sprinted down the hall . Nick lay there unconscious for fifty seconds or sountil a swarm of house security officers , followed by Mr. Zendt ,  |p132came  pounding down the hall into the flat . The whole assault had taken less than two minutes . They walked Nick around the room while he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about this , Mr. Zendt . " " Not a word , sir . " " Do we even have to tell the police about it ? " " He left a gun , Mr. Thirkield , " the chief security officer said . " We have to report the whole thing . " " But the police are cooperative , " Mr. Zendt said . " And you 'd goddam well better make sure of that , Flicker . " " Mr. Thirkield is gunna have to talk to them , " Flicker said . " I have a meeting at eight thirty , " Nick said . " If they can get here in time for me to make the meeting , I 'll be happy to talk to them . " " Otherwise tomorrow ? " Flicker asked wistfully . " Sure . Why not ? " The telephone rang . " That would be my father , " Nick said . " He has heard about the attack no doubt . " He walked unsteadily away from them , then turned to ask if Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it affected the meeting with the National Magazine , too bad . He needed it . He closed the door of the study and picked up the phone . " Yes , Pa ? " he said automatically . It was Pa . It was n't Yvette . " Did they nail the son-of-a-bitch ? He must be somewhere in the goddam building . " Nick figured that the British hit man must have called Pa himself to make sure he was filled in . " Not yet . He wore a derby hat and sounded like he came from London . " " London ? " " Carswell probably sent him . " " No jokes , kid . This is very bad . I do n't give a goddam what you say , we are putting a security team on you . " " All right , Pa . " " How did you fight off a professional with a gun ? I ca n't tellp133you what a terrific feeling it gives me that you actually saved yourself by fighting off an armed man . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops giving this to the papers . Leave it to me . " Pa , something very big happened in Philadelphia this afternoon . I drove out with Commissioner Frey to Heller 's house to look for the gun . We did n't find it , but we got voice prints William Casper and a woman who calls herself Mrs. Casper made in Heller 's office . He was one of those nuts who records everything . But the thing is , all of a sudden there is a woman in this case . A woman in her middle thirties with silver hair , Mrs. Heller says , and Commissioner Frey is sending copies of the tapes to you so that Cerutti can analyze them . " " You are absolutely terrific , Nick . " Nick felt the glow beginning at his toes and starting upward . " It just happened to happen , Pa , " he said . " Well , I am telling you that you are solving this case . " Pa hung up . When Nick returned to the big room only Mr. Zendt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked nervously . " Yes . He just wondered if we had caught the gunman , that 's all . " " We 'll have him within the hour , Mr. Thirkield . " " The hour ? " " We have only two floors of rooms and suites for transients . The rest are all leased apartments . In order to get up here the man would have had to check in to one of the transient accommodationsor he would have had to ask at the desk for someone who had an apartment and who would clear him with the desk before he could get upstairs . The security officers are making the check on the transient rooms first . They think he returned to one of them to wait until a chance came to get out of the building . In the meantime , Mr. Thirkield , we have these photographs takenof people who checked into the hotel in the past forty-eight hoursp134or who inquired at the desk to call on a tenant in the building . " " You photograph people who check in ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the desk we also record him to synchronize with the photos . Your father insists on this . " Nick pulled the seventh picture from the top of the stack . " That 's the man , " he said . Mr. Zendt turned the photo over . " He checked in at six forty-five yesterday evening . We had a reservationfrom a travel agency in Malta . " " Malta ? " " We 'll get him . It is as hard to get out of this building as it is to get in . " The wine arrived . The city detectives came in right behind it . Nick reidentified the photograph of the man , said he had British speech and probably a bruised head , while Mr. Zendt talked to the front desk and came up with information that the man had registered as Martin Keys and that he had a British passport . The police took the gun and left to work with the hotel security on a comb-out of the apartments in the building . A house physician appeared . He pressed a sedative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead.  |p135SATURDAY  NIGHT , FEBRUARY 2 , 1974 NEW YORKChantal Lamers seemed to have lost the skinny , pale look he remembered her having . How could he ever have thought she was skinny , he asked himself . She was n't merely " interesting looking " anymore either . She was an absolute gas to stare at . He began to have actively lewd thoughts as he watched her cross the restaurant to join him . Join him ? More than lewd , he estimated  --  lewder . She was shucking off her coat as she hurried toward his table . As she leaned far forward to free her second arm , still walking , he had to grip his chair compulsively to keep himself from diving head first into her beckoning decolletage . He shook the china on the table as he arose , dismayed by an instant erection . He had lived alone too long , he decided . He dropped a napkin in front of himself in a gesture of diffidence , not to say personal daintiness  --  as a matador might work with a cape  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most women were fly-watchers , but Miss Lamers was a fly-starer . She had seen it , hefted it mentally , and the experience allowed her to feel all the happier about everything . You are involved in multiple grisly murders , he told himself . It is your responsibility to convince this woman that the essence of American history is within the grasp of her journalism , so that she will lead the way to the topmost reaches of the management of her magazine and possibly bring to justice a man who had killed more people than Landru , and yet he was peeking down the front of her dress and manufacturing erections . She wore a tiny nile-green patch where the unsightly bandage had been . She wore matching eye makeup , and that startled him , because he knew that women who wear eye makeup and ankle bracelets were usually just as unaccountably lewd as he was . He had thought of her as being far more serious than that . He wanted to notice whether her dress gave her any of the thirty-one hundredextras that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not bear to take his eyes away from that neckline . He was appalled to realize that the urgency of being with Yvette Malone was disappearing from his mind with the speed of the evanescence of the Cheshire cat . What disturbed his deepest sense of self , his image of what he was and had always been to himself , however , was that seventy minutes after a man with a gun had been determined to throw him out of a skyscraper window , he could pursue such lascivious thoughts , pursue them as a groupie pursues an employed rock singer . Then he knew he should not have thought of the man with the gun . It was spoiling everything . Instantly he lost the erection . He felt like a living Indian rope trick . " Are you all right , Mr. Thirkield ? " " Oh , yes . Thank you . I did feel a little odd for a moment . Perhaps I stood up too quickly . " " Your face seems a little swollen too , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were able to come to New York so soon . " Her Muskogee accent was fruity and gorgeous . She talked like a field hand in Gone with the Wind , which he had seen in Bhutan . " Something to drink ? " he murmured . " A Gibson , please . " " Two Gibsons , " Nick told the table captain , even though he deplored gin . People who drank gin simply walked differently . The captain departed on the run , because Mr. Thirkield 's father owned the restaurant . They dined on fillets of brill poached and glazed in Mornay sauce ; coq an vin cooked in La Gaffeliere ' 6i . They finished a vanilla souffle with pieces of biscuit soaked in kirsch and anisette . The food was so good they talked less than they thought they would . The wine was so good that they talked more than Miss Lamers thought she should . Nick had a marvelous time : thebodice , that slack red cushion of a mouth , the food and herp137anecdotes  --  about actors , jockeys and politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all built his euphoria . " You must know two thousand people more than I 'll ever know , " Nick said . " I never met those people , " Miss Lamers murmured . " It 's just that I usually take my lunch to the office and eat it in our file room , which has all kinds of stuff we ca n't print about people like that . " " I 'd sure like to read the file on Tim Kegan , " Nick said . " Are you a Kegan admirer ? " " He was my half brother . " Miss Lamers dropped a spoon . " Oh , dear God , " she said , " and there I was ruffling my mouth with those awful stories about him . " She blushed like a peony . " I am just terribly embarrassed . " " Oh , please ! No . He would have loved those stories  --  that is , those particular stories . Anyway , Tim is why we 're having dinner  --  in a way . I mean , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important . It is so important that before I start I 'll have to ask you to keep total silence on it  --  that is , until my father and I say you can print it . " " Your father ? " " Yes . Is that okay ? " " I  --  well , I guess so . " " The story concerns the fact that I talked with the man who fired the second rifle at my brother 's assassination . In a way , considering the findings of the Pickering Commission , you could call it the third rifle . That 's enough to start with , is n't it ? " " My God , yes . " " I 'd like to talk to your editor . If we can reach a written understanding that the story is mine , that it belongs only to me under the protection of common-law copyright , I will tell him everything I have found out about my brother 's murder . " " This is simply fantastic , Mr. Thirkield . " Her large eyes got larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that actresseswere supposed to have violet eyes , but this was too much.  | " There is also a woman 's angle . I mean , there is a woman involved with the assassination team . " She suddenly got pale with excitement . " I 'll call my editor right now , " she said . She walked out of the dining room rapidly . The hire car drove them to the National Magazine building . She held his hand tensely in the car all the way across town . She smelled very good . They walked hurriedly across the plaza to the building 's night entrance . Miss Lamers signed them in . They rode up to the main editorial floor . It was ten fifty-two , the receptionareaclock said . The office of the managing editor , Harry Greenwood , was totally bare and functional , with a desk , two chairs , a picture of the founder on the wall and sealed windows . Greenwood was a tall , almost languid man , younger than Nick , with an elaborate Harvard Yard accent . His working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been at home across town when Miss Lamers had telephoned . He had just gotten there before them . The stitching around his lapels seemed tattooed on . Nick feared to look down in case he might find two-toned shoes . Before he shook hands with Nick , Greenwood paused to rinse his hands with Guerlain 's cologne from a large cut-glass bottle . " Please sit down , " he said . It was an unctuous voice . " Miss Lamers told me what you have in mind , Mr. Thirkield , and I am greatly excited . I took the liberty of sending down for some photographs of you , just to be sure we were talking to the right man  --  so that is quite satisfactory . How does this letter agreement look to you ? Are you warm enough ? Would you like a drink ? " He slid the magazine 's letterhead across the bare desk . Nick studied it . He passed it back and nodded . Greenwood signed both copies . Miss Lamers signed as witness . Nick folded his copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have evidence to prove , " he said , " that the Pickering Report is all wet . " " Prove ? " Greenwood said . " We think we have enough evidence to go to the President andp139ask that the investigation be reopened . " It occurred to Nick vaguely that he was overreacting to his distaste for Greenwood by being maybe a little too sweeping in his statements . " Is there any way we can help you ? " " That 's why I 'm here , actually . We 've come to an area where we need help . " " What 's the area ? " " Organized crime . For starters , I 'd like to see everything you have on Joe Diamond . " " Well , sure . We 're loaded on Diamond . If we are n't , we should be . " " I have to know where he came from  --  which geographical area of national crime . We think someone who knew him from the old days came to him in Philadelphia with what they call the ' contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can find out who dug up Diamond for the organizer of the assassination , we 'll be able to buy from them  --  in one way or another  --  the names of the people who came to them . " " Very logical , " Greenwood said . " My God , yes , " Miss Lamers chimed . " Get the Diamond files , please , Miss Lamers , " Greenwood directed . She left the room with the speed of a bird . " I was a great admirer of your brother , " Greenwood said nasally . " Everyone was , " Nick said . " What was he really like ? " Greenwood asked after a few minutesof silence . " He had wit and wisdom , " Nick said . Miss Lamers returned with a stack of three thick file folders which she handed to Greenwood . " Newspaper clips , " Greenwood said and flopped the folder on the desk . " Post-arrest stuff . " He dropped the second file . " Personal . This is the one . Read through it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if we can find sonic coffee . " Ile handed the file to Nick . Greenwood and Miss I , anicrs left the r(x)n.  |p140Nick  went through it slowly . Joe Diamond had started as a hanger-on with the Cleveland Syndicate . The Syndicate , which had begun in the pre-World War I period , had originally been partly the Mayfield Road mob ( Sicilian ) and partly the Purple Gang of Detroit ( Jewish ) . These two Cleveland elements combined with an Irish group in 1913 when a brawling circulation war began between two Cleveland newspapers , the News and the Plain Dealer . The Mayfield Road mob worked for the News . It kept them in training for the big upcoming opportunities of Prohibition . The gang congregated in the Woodlands section of Cleveland , where 213 murders were committed between 1918 and 1930 , and where 98 houses of prostitution flourished . Yussel Schell , a/k/a Joe Diamond , was a Woodlands boy born in 1910 , just too late to cash in on the big Prohibition action but ready to learn his trade in the Depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gambling joints and doing collection work on the Ohio-Kentucky border . According to the file , at about the time World War II ended he went back to work for Samuel " Gameboy " Baker , whom he 'd worked for in the Syndicate , this time as assistant muscle ( and the boss 's gunsel , which does n't mean what it sounds like ) at the Lookout House near Covington , Kentucky , and , in the winter season , at the Island Club in Miami Beach . Gameboy Baker , until Frank Heller came along , was Diamond'slifetime idol . He tried to model everything he did on Gameboy 's example in every way . Gameboy taught him that cops were terrific people  --  strong , action men , and if you were always on the right side of the cops they could do plenty for you . He also took pains to explain that you should never admit to making more than 35 percent of what you were actually making if you were working with cops , because they always tried to take as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . To love cops . Gameboy said that about Joe and always got a laugh . It is hard to say what made Joe Diamond so crazy about GameboyBaker . Gameboy was a schmuck.  |p141The  four Cleveland fellows who owned the Syndicate , with an outstanding assist from two Sicilians , were Jews operating in Cleveland , Canada , Kentucky-Ohio , Florida and Arizona . Nobodyelse in the business operated with a spread like that . They were pumping out real money in Arizona when everybody was looking at Vegas  --  not that they have stopped . Joe Diamond left the Syndicate in Tucson to join Lansky 's operation in Cuba , which kept him in Cuba straight through the war , because he made some solid political contacts there who put him into the narcotics industry . Sometime in the early fifties Diamond came up with a bundle and opened a restaurant and a bar in Philadelphia , influenced by the glamour of Gameboy Baker 's development of the famous Odeon Grill in Vincent Street in Cleveland , which was , and still is , the place to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , it 's a line , I guess . He started in Cleveland , so I should start there too . " " Let me talk to our people in the morning , " Greenwood said . " We have the best people in the country on organized crime . " " Can I call you about eleven ? " Miss Lamers asked Nick demurely . " We can pinpoint this thing , " Greenwood said . " This is an area I know we can deliver on . " Greenwood and Nick shook hands good night . Miss Lamers and Nick left the building together , he mumbling that he would take her home . She protested that she could easily get a taxi . " While I have a car and a driver ? " he said . " Do n't be silly . " She gave the driver an address on East Thirty-first Street . " Please call me Chantal , " she said . " Why ? " " It 's my name ! " " Oh . I see . How pretty . Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as Nicholas pertains to Santa Claus , does n't it ? Mymother was French , and that 's what she called me . " " My mother was front Utica , New York . "  |p142As  the car rolled down Park Avenue she said , " I 've never been on a story as big as this . This story has become the most romantic thing that could happen to me . " " You must have been about fourteen when they killed Tim . " " Ho-ho . " " Well , I hope you get a raise and a chair of journalism at Harvard out of it . You 've been very helpful to my father and me . " " It 's very easy to be helpful to you . " She stared at him wideeyed . He had a very clear feeling that things were going to happen if she played her cards right . " I 'm very glad to hear that , " he said huskily , then he cleared his throat involuntarily and the sexy effect was gone . " I hope we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so tan , " she murmured . " God , it 's gorgeous . " " It 's really occupational . " " I see you on the bridge of a ship scanning the horizon through narrowed eyes , seeking something , perhaps someone who you and you alone know is waiting for you over the edge of the world . " She blinked . " I certainly hope we will be working closely to-gether . " " There will be a lot of traveling on this story . " " And a lot of danger ? " " Perhaps . But not for you . " " I ca n't get over how  --  out of all the people in the world  --  we came together for this . Where were you a week ago today ? " " Brisbane . Australia . " " Brisbane ! The Coral Sea . Stone fish . Captain Cook sweeping north through that treacherous channel . " " I 'm really not up on the area . " " You crossed the world from the Coral Sea to find me in Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  those two men had not forced me off the road  --  " " I hope they got those guys . " " But we were meant to be . Were n't we meant to be , Nick ? " " I 'd say definitely . "  |p143She  sighed like a cello . Nick had to take his hat off and place it over his erection this time . It was all beginning to make him nervous . He had just proposed marriage to an entirely different woman , and he had been all torn up when she turned him down . What had happened to that emotion ? He was being inconsistent . He was responding disloyally . It was the sort of thing that Tim might have done . " Uh  --  what kind of a fellow is Greenwood ? " " Who ? " " Your editor . " " Oh , fine . Harry is fine . " " I suppose it 's a pretty close relationship  --  writer and editor . " " On some things , yes . " The car stopped at Chantal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds in a mock absent , undecided sort of way . Nick discovered he was holding her hand . " Wo n't you come up for a drink ? " Chantal said . " Thank you . I 'd like a drink very much . " They got out of the car with elaborate movements . They walked together to the entrance of the towering apartment building , then Nick stopped and turned . " I 'll have to tell the driver how long he 'll have to wait , " he said . Chantal caught his sleeve calmly and unnoticeably . " Why do n't you just send him home ? " she murmured , eyes appropriately cast down . Nick cleared his throat again and ran lightly back to the car . " I 'll call the garage if I need a car , " he told the driver . " ' Night , now . " Chantal 's apartment was attractive , unexpectedly not like her at all , done in chrome-and-glass Italian modern  --  low , blocky , impossible furniture , with a lot of mauve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging over all . Before Chantal disappeared she put a large goblet of Yugoslavian red wine into his hand . He decided to concentrate on his own disapprovalof Tim and the way he had leaped from woman to woman to woman . He had spent six weeks at the hospital under the careof Keith l , ee complaining bitterly about all the ass Tim hadp144managed to get , and when he had exhausted himself on the subject , naming the names of women who were absolute pillars of the national establishment , Keith had " explained " Tim 's commitmentto exchanging old bodies for new . Nick reasoned that the worst thing that could happen to him , especially after a year of such intensive psychotherapy , would be if he allowed himself to conduct his life as Tim had done . Not that he could deny himself sex totally . That would be carrying a silly compulsion ridiculously far . He had never really discovered if he was like Tim . He was here , in this woman 's drug-fumed apartment . He hardly knew her , but just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lying absolutely naked on a bed beside her . If he loved Yvette , could he have put himself in such a spot ? Did he and Tim have so much in common as half brothers that he really had no control over his disloyalty to the woman he loved ? At least Tim had n't been disloyal . After his brief marriage he had never committed himself to any woman . Keith Lee had said , " As in the song , Tim was a motherless child . The operative word for Tim 's endless excursions into endless vaginas  --  that long tunnel in which there is no light  --  is seeking . ' He was endlessly searching for Mama . Of course he could n't find her , but he peered closely into almost every woman he met . Because it is a tremendous distinction , a tremendousthing to have over other women , to screw the President of the United States , Tim got to do even more searching than other men with his problem . No matter how much they appeared to look like his dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a search is never satisfied , it must continue , because the point of the search is that it fail . Of course if he found a mama , sex with her would be forbidden anyway , and that is the point of the whole search and what makes it endless . " Nick was about to attempt to put the parallel to himself and get to the true bottom of where , really and exactly , he stood with Yvette and she with him , when Chantal came back into the roomwearing the goddamndest getup he had ever seen , making self/analysis impossible . She was wearing a sensible sweater and skirt . She had gone inside and had changed into a sensible sweater and skirt and a pair of sheep's-wool-lined bedroom slippers . It was a sensible sweater , because the way her chest bobbled around in there he knew it was all alone . The way the slippers called attention to her improbably perfect bare legs made it better than even money that she had nothing on under the skirt . She was extending a box half filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked and sat down on the sofa beside him . Music was playing from somewhere in a distant room , but not too distant . " Beautiful music , " he said , exhaling a pound and a half of smoke . " It 's an open-end machine . " " Very sexy . " " It can play for seven hours . " He pulled her . He pushed his fingers along the soft skin of her sides under her sweater to her breasts . She had nipples like thumbs , and her breath had begun to fall out of her like a marathonrunner 's . He distinctly heard her say , " I think I 'm falling in love with you . " He kissed her , a kiss for its own time , unending . By manipulating a simple zipper he discovered that it was quite true that she had nothing on under her skirt . He decided that Tim had been utterly right . They outlasted the open-end machine by thirty-two minutes . When he awoke he was as naked as a nixon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock on a widely sunny morning . He yodeled eight bars from " Der Burgenstock Ewig . " It brought Chantal running into the room . She had nothing on either . It looked great . " What 's the matter ? " she said with alarm . " Come here . " " I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " I 'm making breakfast . " " But the spatter . You twist be delicious . Conic here . "  | " I have to get to work . " " You are the most marvelously depraved woman I have ever known , and you are never going to leave this place again . Neither am I. " " Oh  --  honey  --  " She approached near enough to be pulled down . " I 'll show you how to liberate a woman , " he said . " I have never felt more like liberating a woman in my life . " The garage sent a car . Nick dropped Chantal off at the NationalMagazine building . She told him she would call him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Syndicate people in Cleveland . Nick had gotten more euphoric with each block they rode uptown . " I do n't think I 've ever awakenedon any day of my life as happy as I felt this morning , " was one of the things he said . " It was the pot . " Chantal could have had postcoital depression . She was wearing the same clothes she had worn the night before . " I have to tell you something . " " No , please , Nick . Please do n't tell me anything . I mean not anything that would naturally follow a sentence like that at a time like this . " " Why not ? " " Because it will inevitably be about your past , and just for this morning I 'd like it a lot better if I could tell myself that both of us had been reborn . " " Why  --  that 's beautiful , Chantal . " She patted his hand . " But you sound sad , " he said . " Do I ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain . I exulted all night , Nick darling . Now  --  well , it 's back to the same old chains . " " Not necessarily . " She smiled at him.  |p147As  he rode uptown alone he was happy that he had n't said any more . First things first . He had to establish where Yvette stood before he went forward with a new claim . Anyway , what the hell . Chantal had been marvelous  --  but Yvette was Yvette . Even if she would n't marry him . She had it , whatever it was that held his total attention , night and day . Chantal cared . He could feel that . He could feel that as if he were a living Ouija board . Maybe a little part of it was caring about his money . Maybe a bigger part of it was caring about Tim and what he had overachieved . But that could be the entire trouble with Yvette . She had too much money . It was a mistake to allow women to get money . It changed everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would listen to the tens of millions of children ? Chantal Lamers needed him , cared for him , and after a few more nights like last night  --  if he could stay in the satyric condition he was in  --  she could learn to adore him . Where had she learned all she knew ! Poppaea Sabina , a titleholder , was a Salvation Army lassie compared with Chantal in the field of sexual erudition . But , still , there was something absolutely wild-making when a woman refused to marry a man.  |p148SUNDAY  MORNING , FEBRUARY 3 , 1974-NEW YORKAs he walked across the lobby of the Walpole he had to admit that when Pa bought anything he really maintained it well . This was the classiest hotel in New York , and the food in one of Pa 's restaurants last night had been up to the best of first-class food he had ever had anywhere  --  beyond Si 's chili and noodles . Tack another fifty years on Pa 's life and the whole country would be looking great , because Pa would own it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nine forty in the morning . Both messages were from Yvette . Well ! So she wanted to make it all up , did she ? She had probably thought everything over and now wanted to marry him . If so , what stand should he take ? He felt the grab of guilt . He stared at his own face in the elevator mirror all the way up to the tower . He telephoned her before he took off his coat and hat , but she was n't there . Where could she be ? Why was n't she home at such an hour of the morning ? Could she have been out doing what he had been doing while he was in the same city with her ? He loved her . She understood things about him that no one else understood . She had never laughed at his long woolen underwear ( the most sensiblewinter garment a man could wear ) the way Chantal had laughed at it this morning . Certainly a girl as honest as Yvette would n't play games by calling him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there when he called back ? He went into the kitchen to get a glass of milk and found Pa , in a beautifully tailored green-and-white-checked jacket , sitting at a table by the window eating the second half of a grapefruit . " What the hell were you doing at the National Magazine ? " Pa asked . " How did you know I was at the National Magazine ? " " A hoodlum tried to put a gun on you and throw you out the window last night . Do you think I 'm going to let you walk around alone from now on ? " Nick blushed with enormous gratification . As he had observedp149himself , Pa maintained his properties . " Thanks , Pa . " " Who did you see ? " " The editor . " " Harry Greenwood ? " " Yes . " " How come you know him ? " " I met a woman in Oklahoma who works there . I called her and she introduced me to Greenwood . " " Where ? " " At his office . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chantal Lamers . " " I never heard of her . Did you screw her last night ? " Nick glared at him . " I forgot . You 're the Boy Scout in the family . Tim always shared information on his broads . " " I thought we had reached a general understanding that I 'm not Tim . " " I want to know what you told the magazine . " " Pa , listen  --  " " You did it . You told them . " Pa resumed eating . He stared downward at the traffic pattern . He looked murderous . Nick took the letter agreement out of his pocket and put it down on the table beside his father . Pa read it without touching it . Then he said , " You are n't as dumb as I thought . This is something , anyway . Leave it with me . " He wheeled around in the chair . " Okay . What is it all about ? " " It 's open and shut , " Nick said . " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who agreed to find a murderer for the men who decided to kill Tim . The only way a civilian can get to the top of organized crime is through the press . So I went to the National Magazine . " " I see . " " If you know a better way , let 's do it "  | " It depends on who you talk to , Nick , " Pa said . " Do you really think a bunch of entertainers at a magazine are going to know who to talk to ? " " Pa , they have people who do nothing else but work with organized crime ! " " You could have asked me . " " To find one top gangster out of thousands ? " " You did n't ask me . But let it lay . What did the magazine people do for you ? " " They expect to have the name of a contact before noon today . " " Okay . It 's a lot of shit , but as soon as they tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come all the way to New York for that ? " " I go into the hospital in an hour . " " Hospital ? " Nick was bewildered . Pa had seldom looked this well . " The quarterly checkup . Three days every three months . That 's how I made it to seventy-four . Maybe you 'd better stay right here until I get out . " " I can take care of myself . " " The name of the killer who went after you last night is Martin Keys . He got out of the hotel with the late-afternoon shift of cooks . Now listen to this . After he got out of the building , all in the clear , he came back to his room just to prove he had never been involved . He walked in the front door , sauntered across the lobby and asked for his key . Then he went to his room . Zendt sent for the cops . Now  --  ready ? Our camera record shows that this Mr. Martin Keys is not the Mr. Keys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Mr. Keys 's passport , but with his own  --  a different  --  picture in it . The first Mr. Keys , as you know , was dark and bulky . The second Mr. Keys is shortish , with ginger hair and a ginger moustache . But the little bastard did n't know about the concealed cameras , so the cops are working himover right now . I called Ben Kiely , the chief inspector for the Eastp151Side , and I told him to beat the living shit out of him . " " How do people get into businesses like that ? " Nick asked earnestly . " Laziness , " Pa said . " Lissen , Nick , you better know , I have an invisible team all over you around the clock wherever you go , you understand ? " " Do you own the agency , Pa ? " " In my kind of businesses you 've got to own a national detectiveagency . I pay it in , take that as a tax deduction , then get it back as profits . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What hospital will you be in ? " " The Anglican Memorial . " " Do you own the hospital , Pa ? " " Use your head , kid . There is no business today that can compete with owning a hospital . " He ticked the points off on his long fingers . " No credit for the customers , and they pay in advance or out on their ass . Next , supply and demand is constant . Third , a unique product  --  pain  --  right ? A hospital is a hotel for pain , but what hotel gets those prices ? Christ , the laundry alone throws off enough to pay the orderlies and the lab . And you should see the net figures on what one of those labs makes . I own twenty-seven hospitals in nineteen cities , kid , and I 'd like to have fifty more . " Pa patted Nick on the shoulder as he went past . He turned at the door . " My advice to you , Nick , is own whatever you use  --  forget railroads and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them . Break everything down into food , shelter , clothing , diversion and dying  --  then own everything . I was luckier than you , because I bought everything in the Depression when you could get useful industries for a nickel on the dollar . I live absolutelyfree now . I own farms , cattle , freezing firms , airlines , ferry services , the best restaurants , French vineyards , California vineyards , Scotch distilleries , hotels , resorts , apartment houses , housingdevelopments , shopping centers , three great tailors , sixty-two whorehouses where they 're legal , two cable-TV companies , a setp152of satellities and a national undertaking system  --  and other useful things , like pharmaceutical houses , wholesale loan-sharking and twenty-seven hospitals . And what have you got ? A lousy twentymillion-dollaroil company , which , like all other oil companies any day now , is going to run out of oil or be taxed out of business or be expropriated by the locals . " He left the kitchen , with Nick staring blankly after him . Nick heard the front door slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer . The telephone rang . He ran to Tim 's study for maximum comfort . It was Yvette . " Where were you ? " he wailed . " At Gristede 's . Why ? " " Oh . " " The last time I called you , " Yvette said sweetly , " it was one thirty in the morning , but still I expect you noticed how I did not greet you with a Where were you ? ' " " I 've gotten very , very involved in this thing . " " I bet . " " I do n't want even to talk about it . I 'm scared witless that you could get mixed up in it  --  the way other people have . " " Okay , honey . " " It 's wonderful just to talk to you . " " I used to think I was in love with you , but now  --  " " What ? " He was terror-stricken . He had about as large a reserveof cool as a Pittsburgh steel smelter at full production . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I 'm inlove with you . " He groaned . " Why the groan ? " " It was a groan of ecstasy . I love you , Yvette . I have loved you for three years , but more every day , more wherever I was and you were n't there , more every month and every year . I am simply crazy about you , Yvette . " Bye-bye , Chantal , he thought . Quoth the Thirkield , never more . " I am very happy . Right now . " " Then we can get married ? "  | " Shall we have dinner tonight ? " " I 'm waiting for a call about Tim . They are trying to set up an appointment . I may have to fly to Cleveland . " " Can you call me by six ? I 'll be back here at three . I 'm having lunch out , then I 'll come right back here . " " Absolutely . " Chantal Lamers called from the reception desk downstairs at eleven fifty . She was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be there . " Is this where he lived ? " " Yes . This is it , " Nick said . " Oh , it 's beautiful ! I can just feel him everywhere in the atmosphereof this wonderful place . " " My father put little bronze tabs on the chairs in there  --  if you 'd like to see those . " " I would . Oh , I would ! " He took her to the chairs . She read the identical inscription oneach : PRESIDENT TIMOTHY MEGAN SAT HERE 1955-1960 . " MyGod , " Chantal said . " I can not tell you what a wonderful feeling this gives me . " " He used that john , " Nick said , gesturing vaguely . Chantal ran into the loo and shut the door . He went out to the living room again to wait for her . When she joined him , after what he thought was an inconsiderable length of time , she asked if there was some souvenir she might take with her . " How about an ashtray ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be heaven , darling . But would it be really his ? Would he have tapped one of his famous cigars on it ? " " I 'll get you the one from his bedside , " Nick said . " He not only tapped his famous cigar on that but frequently kept his vitamin C pills on it . " " Oh , Nick , dearest . " After she had stowed a hotel ashtray in her purse she told him that ever since the killing of Willie Arnold , Evander Milship , the magazine 's organized crime person had had as his hobby thep154background and career of Joe Diamond . " He was able to actually pinpoint the man in Cleveland to whom the someone you are searching for had gone to find a man in Philadelphia who would undertake the job . The man is now a very , very highly placed member of the Syndicate . Evander says he was the protege of a founder-member named Moey Dalitz or Davis . This man 's name is Irving Mentor . He was the immediate superior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving Mentor is the man , Evander said this morning , who had smoothed everything out with the Sicilians so that Diamond could come back from Cuba after the war . " " That 's great , " Nick said . " But can your man set a meeting for me with Mentor ? " " He 's already set a meeting . Harry Greenwood has had Evander working on this all night . " " Where ? " " Mentor will be sitting alone in the back of an El Dorado Cadillac in Vincent Street , in Cleveland , directly across from the Odeon Grill . Now , you 'll have to remember certain things . You must get into the car from the traffic side . Get into the back , beside Mentor . You then say your name and tell him you are from Monroe . Eleven tonight . " " Monroe , Alabama , or Monroe , Mississippi ? " " No . Monroe is some man 's name . Just Monroe . " " Okay . It 's like some kid 's game . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told Evander you have to do . Mentor knows what you want , but he wo n't cooperate for less than fifteen thousand dollars . But we 'll pay it . " " No , no . I 'll pay it . " " No  --  really . We insist . " " No . It gives the magazine too much of a lock on the story , " Nick said . " It 's too early to put yourselves in a proprietary position , because it is n't your story yet . " " But we are vouching for the quality of Mentor 's information . You would be paying out fifteen thousand only on our say-so . "  | " I knew I 'd have to pay somebody something . What 's the difference ? This way I 'll be paying with confidence . " Chantal sighed . " All right , then . I hope this does n't get Harry Greenwood angry . " " If it does , you tell me . " " Thanks . The next thing is  --  I 've been assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " " No . " Chantal was shocked and hurt . " No ? " " Listen , Chantal . A lot of people have died because they got too close to this story . Anyway , Mentor would n't talk if you got into the car , because you 'd be what they call in his business a corroborating witness . You stay here for this one , and you can interview me with a tape machine when I get back . " " Suppose you do n't get back ? What happens to the story then ? " Her voice was coldly professional . " You are closer to all the facts than anyone alive . If anybody is killed , your name should be at the top of the list . " " When you come right down to it , " Nick said , " I 'm the only one they wo n't kill  --  not yet anyhow . " " Why not ? " " Because I have passed everything I know  --  and all the evidenceI have piled up  --  along to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capper . The President would be absolutely forced to reopen the case , my father would set up such a hue and cry . " " Then , in good faith , I think we should spend the afternoon right here , and you should spill everything you know about the case , down to the smallest detail , into a tape recorder so the magazine will have the story when , as , and if anything happens to you . " " That was n't the deal I made , " Nick said . " First , the magazine helps me to rim down the people who located Diamond for the killers . When that is all sorted out , then we sit down and work out the whole story . " She put her arms around his neck and kissed his throat softly  | " Do n't do any part of it , " she said . " Do n't go to Cleveland , and to hell with the story . Your brother is dead and nothing can bring him back . I could n't stand it if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they think they have to find out all you know . " Dropping her arms , she clung to his crotch with fear and devotion . He laid her on the floor as if she were a departmentstoredummy . Then he laid her  --  on the floor.  |p157SUNDAY  NIGHT , FEBRUARY 3 , 1974-NEW YORKPa 's gargantuan hospital , whose lab threw off such great figures , towered considerably higher along the East River , north of the Queensborough Bridge , than the white cliffs of Dover . Pa had settled down in a three-room suite , the equivalent of the owner 's cabin on an ocean liner but more luxurious . He had a duplicate of his White House switchboard , with its eighteen direct lines , installed beside his bed . There was no smell of iodoform in Pa 's suite . There was a gentling scent of Jolie Madame which Pa sprayed on his two nurses three times a day . For decoration , the Metropolitan had sent four important pieces  --  two paintings and two sculptures . There was a magnificent vaseful of two dozen long-stemmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative of all were the two nurses , Eve and Rose , beautiful young women with brave , starched white caps and great big knockers . One of them was reading to Pa from Barron 's Weekly , the other was feeding him grapes , when Nick arrived . Pa seemed so content that Nick could hear the regret in his voice when he asked Eve and Rose to leave him with his son . " How 'd you like to climb one of those , kid ? " he asked when they left . Nick shrugged . " How did the magazine meeting go ? " " I have a meeting in Cleveland at eleven tonight with a man named Irving Mentor who is at the top of the Syndicate . " " Never heard of him . " " Why should you ? " " Nick , when I say ' even you , ' I am reaching away out to the edge of the world , right ? But even you may have heard of Frank Mayo . Did you ever hear of him , Nick ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underworld . " " Do you know of a bigger hood ? " " I do n't know any others . " " Frank Mayo will he here in about ten minutes . We 'll ask him ahoiit Irving Mentor . " " Gee , Pa , how come ? "  | " Because I 've been in the whiskey business and a few other businesses since the twenties . Frank was my partner in a lot of things . Punks who were street-corner hustlers when I was a big man with these guys are now big bosses . That 's the Gee , Pa , how come . " " Who do n't you know ? " Nick asked with a sudden flash of hatred . " Well , I do n't know you , kid , but it does n't throw me , because you do n't either . " " If the National Magazine says Mentor is a big man , then he has to be a big man in crime , " Nick said . " Would you ask Frank Mayo to recommend a newsstand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank knows . Those punks would n't know a Syndicate executive from Mary Miles Minter . " Eve popped her head into the room . " Mr. Mayo is here , Mr. Kegan , " she said gaily . " Send him in , " Pa said . Salvatore Verdigerri , a/k/a Frank Mayo , a/k/a Frank Brown , was a flawlessly dressed man in elegant charcoal-gray flannel , with a carefully knotted black knitted Mafia tie and immaculate fingernailswithout polish . He sounded perpetually hoarse , as if he spent the mornings bawling out police captains at the top of his voice . He had quiet assurance and the gift of geniality . He could have been about five years younger than Pa , Nick thought . Of the two men Nick would have found it far easier to believe that Pa was the criminal , Frank Mayo the tycoon . Pa became manically hospitable . He directed Mayo to a wicker chair . He introduced Nick . He asked how Mr. Mayo had liked the two nurses , Eve and Rose . Then he said , " Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salame de felino and a culatello di Zibello from Parma , direct from Parma , and fifteen pounds of grana from Montecchio  --  absolutely gorronteed straveccione  --  just like the old days . " " How ? How did you get it ? " Mayo asked with amazement . " Interest is the key to life , " Pa said . " I sent a man over in myp159own plane with a blank check and he came back with it . But that ai n't all , Frank . I got a whole case of Brunello de Montalccino 1945 . Right here . " " Holy Jesus . " Eve and Rose came trooping in with tea carts loaded with slices of salame and culatello , oblong hunks of parmigiano cheese , glasses and three opened bottles of red wine . " Holy Jesus , " Mr. Mayo said again . " Do n't tell anybody I 'm so crazy about this kind of food , because I 'm supposed to be a Sicilian . " His voice was really so coarsely hoarse that he might have had a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese very daintily , staring at Pa while he chewed it . " That has got to be eight , ten years old , " he said . " I do n't know where you can get eight-year-old parmigiano even in Parma , fahcrissakes . " " I 'm going to send you a wheel of it , " Pa said . The nurses poured the wine and the men sipped it reverently . " Eat ! " Mr. Mayo said to Nick . " Jesus , just try that culatello . " Nick dug in . " That 's some glassa wine  --  right , Mr. Thirkield ? " Mr. Mayo said to Nick . " I 'll accept a case , " Nick said , and that broke Mr. Mayo up . When he recovered he said , " What 's on your mind , Mr. Kegan ? " " Frank , I am going to tell you something that I will not tell toanybody else  --  and you know what a tight trap I have . " " Go ahead , Mr. Kegan . " " Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed my boy , Tim . " " Son-of-a-bitch ! " " Okay . Frank , did you ever hear of a pezzo da novanta in the Syndicate named Irving Mentor ? " " Mentor ? " " M-c-n-t-o-r . Irving . " " No . Never . A pezzo da novanta ? Never . And I am two bunnettpercent sure . " I Ic glared at Nick to defy him . " Frank , this is very close to time . "  | " Look , Mr. Kegan  --  there could be like a coffee-runner who works for some paperhanger who has a son who is like maybe a barber who cuts hair for Syndicate fellas , but , believe me , there is no pezzo da novanta name of Irving Mentor  --  believe me , I am telling you . " " This is the straight story , Frank . Somebody in Cleveland gave the contract to Joe Diamond to hit my son Tim  --  your Presi-dent . " Nick blinked . Mayo and Pa stared at each other . Mr. Mayo poured another glass of wine . Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke again . " You always hear about these things too late . I knew about it right after . But it was n't a business thing . They did it on their own . " " Frank  --  I 'm with you , " Pa said . " But now my son needs to talk to the man who gave Joe Diamond the contract , because he will know who paid the bills . " " Mr. Mayo , " Nick said , " if you are talking to Cleveland , maybe you could ask who this Irving Mentor is . " " Who told you about him ? " " The National Magazine . " " Aa ! They think Big Jim Colisimo is still operating . " " Nick is supposed to meet this Irving Mentor at eleven tonight , " Pa said . " Well , that 's a long trip for nothing , Mr. Thirkield , " Mayo said . " Why do n't you let us cover it for you ? " " We have a lot of questions we want to ask him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just the same . " Mayo stood up , brushing his fingers lightly . " I 'll call you tumorra , " he said hoarsely . He shook hands with both of them . " I 'll send the rest of the case of wine with the wheel , " Pa said . " You 're gunna make me a hero in my house , " Mayo said . " I 'll call you as soon as I know something . Okay ? "  |p161When  Mayo was gone Nick sipped the unctuous red wine and nibbled on the heavenly cheese . " We know Mentor is nothing , " Pa said , " but that does n't make it a wild-goose chase . That 's why you have to go . " " I have to go just to have it on the National Magazine , " Nick said . He felt sad because a chance at the big time had just eluded Chantal . She had enough stardust in her eyes to bread a veal cutlet . " You better get moving , " Pa said.  |p162SUNDAY  NIGHT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was six twenty and he got her answering service . He left a message that he had been called to Cleveland and that he would call her from there . He got to downtown Cleveland at ten twenty . He called her again from a telephone booth at the Statler , but he got the answering service again , which reported that Mrs. Malone had n't yet called in that night . Nick told them he was calling from Cleveland , that he would try again in the morning . He walked slowly through the winter night . He stood in front of the Hollanden Hotel watching the street . At three minutes to eleven an El Dorado Cadillac parked directly across the street from the Odeon Grill . The driver got out from behind the wheel and sat in the back seat of the car . He was an endomorph  --  a circular mass of flesh wrapped in a camel's-hair overcoat complete with a belt . Nick sensed instinctively that he wore vicuna underwear . It had begun to rain . The area had reached its peak-for-thenighttraffic about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grasped the traffic-side door handle of the Cadillac , opened the door , looked in at a Buddha face impaled upon a flashy cigar , and said , feeling as if he were playing pirates , " I 'm Nick Thirkield . Monroe sent me . " " Get in , " Irving Mentor said . Mentor smelled like a lived-in steak house . " You brought the money ? " he asked . Nick handed him a flat package . " Better count it , " Nick said . " Bet your ass . " Mentor counted it . " Okay , " he said . " The contract to Joe Diamond came from Gameboy Baker . " " And ? " " And what ? " " Tell me about it . " " Joe Diamond was from my old neighborhood . He was a thief when he started out , and he stayed a thief . He got his hand caught in the till in Tucson , and he had to run , because Gameboyp163could n't help him . Moe and Sam put out an offer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . He got so nervous he killed two Sicilians who did n't even have nothing to do wit ' him , so he knew he was now like in double trouble . You know what I mean ? " " Vaguely , " Nick said . " So he got a job in Cuba . By the time the Rappaport boys knew who he was , Joe was in bed wit ' every fagele Cuban politician . So when he told the biggest politician what the Rappaport boys were willing to do to him as a favor to Sam and Moey and the Sicilians , this politician called Max  --  he 's the oldest Rappaport brother  --  to his office , which it is like surrounded wit ' soldiers and wire , and he tells Max he wants to make sure Max protects his friend Joe Diamond . Which Max does . Diamond sat out the war in Cuba  --  if you can call what he did sitting . His Cuban friend gave him a piece of the national lottery , and , believe me , with a very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore and Ohio . Joe had real connections . Almost everybody inna business needed a route to bring in junk without losses , so Joe organized . The French would get their shit as far as Havana , they would be paid , then Joe had the fishing fleet take it into the Keys , then up to Miami . Everybody was making money , so there was a tendency for Moe and Sam to forget and to talk to the Sicilians so they should forget too . They did n't call it off , you understand , they just forgot it for a little while . " " Mr. Mentor , you are telling me more than I want to know about Joe Diamond . All I want to know is , who approached Gameboy Baker to hire Diamond . " " Listen , I 'm witchew . But it takes time . Joe wanted to get back , because now that he had money he had this disease about cops  --  he wanted to be a big man with the cops . But they should be American cops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucson  --  a question of personal popularity . So he opened a saloon in Philly , which it was like a club for cops , and all of a suddenhe is running all the shit in 1'hilly too . He really thought he hadp164it made . If I was ever in Philly I always went to his place . I would call up first and he would ask me to come in playing the heavy movie gangster to impress the cops  --  a bunch of patrolmen and sergeants , fahcrissakes  --  with his big connections . Very funny stuff . But the last time I was there I was like a messenger boy with a message from Gameboy Baker . "  |p165WEDNESDAY  , OCTOBER 28 , 1959-TUCSONJoe Diamond felt sick . He would get in trouble if he vomited going across the lobby of the Santa Rita Hotel in Tucson , but he was afraid it could happen . If he refused to go to Tucson to see Gameboy Baker , Irving Mentor had told him in Philadelphia , then he would be hit . So he went to Tucson even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed his personal presence . Gameboy sent down the word that he was to wait in the lobby . He felt a little better when he sat down . They kept him waiting there from a quarter to eleven in the morning until ten after four in the afternoon . Guys he had known since Woodlands passed three feet away from him all day but they did n't see him ; nobody could see him . At ten after four Jake Lerner told him to come back at nine o'clock . At nine o'clock he was sent right upstairs to Gameboy . Gameboy looked old . All that junk sat on him . He asked Joe if he wanted a sannawitch . They split three pastramis on whole wheat and two bottles of celery tonic . It was lousy pastrami . " If you think the pastrami is bad , " Gameboy said , " do n't ever try Wild West corned beef . " " It must be the local water , " Joe said , trying to be jolly-jaunty . " Water ? Here they cook it in sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Maybe I am and maybe I 'm not , but that is n't what we want to talk about here . I have a contract for you .

" " I want to pay back . " " You are fucking right . " " I can pay back ? " " When you handle this hit you will he paying back . You will be even . "  | " The thing is  --  can I do it ? " " Well , " Gameboy said , " you know how to answer that . " " How ? " " Do n't do it and you 're dead . " " What is the contract ? " " Nobody knows yet . But it is big , because they paid big just for me to talk to you . " " But why me , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , with wonderful built-in friendships with a lot of wonderfulguys . Things had never been so good . " Why me when there are maybe two hundred mechanics who can make any hit better than me ? " " That is what Uncle Louie said to them . Four very good mechanicswere offered to them . But they said no good , because those guys were n't political . " " I 'm political ? " Diamond asked with horror . " Uncle Louie said to them : What is political ? This is business . ' They said we had operated in Cuba and that they 'd like to have somebody from Cuba . So  --  and it was very easy , you schmuck  --  Uncle Louie remembered you . You were eight years in Cuba already , and you are in the FBI files as a political . " " I was never a political in my life ! Fah God 's sake , Sam . " " You speak a little Cuban . You were very good friends with a Cuban minister . " Gameboy leered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is paying said you were what the doctor ordered . Because you have a Commie background in the FBI files . " " Commie ? Sam , I was out by 1949 . Castro did n't take over until 1959  --  now  --  February , this year . " " Joe , what do you want from me ? If people like this decide they have to prove you 're a Commie , so they 'll prove you 're a Cornmie . " People like who ? " " People like who have been proving that certain people are Commies for six years already . "  | " This is crazy . " " Anyway you got ta do it . " " Yeah . " " Moey said you could make your own deal , because that 's the kind of a little guy he is . Also , you got ta take rifle lessons for as long as you have to , out on Pete Volilica 's ranch . " " A rifle ? "  |p168JANUARY  8 , 1960-ARIZONA AND PHILADELPHIAThe rifle teacher on the Volilica ranch was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere with a rifle . They put in twenty-six days , seven hours a day , doing nothing but shooting a rifle . They shot at a dummy that was strapped into the back seat of an old-time touring car that Howie Pearl , who was now the big macher in Cleveland , towed across the field at about a hundred and ten feet away from where Diamond shot on an eighteen-foot-high rise of ground . Diamond had to hit the dummy in the throat . When they had finished he was hitting nine out of every ten shots . Because he was no dope , he figured out that they must be going to hit some guy who rode around in a car with the top down . Gameboy sent him back to Philadelphia and told him to wait to hear from somebody named Casper Williams and that Joe should make his deal with Casper Williams . Joe said good-bye to Gameboy in his room in Tucson , holding him close with one hand and squeezing his ass with the other hand . He never saw Gameboyagain . Although Gameboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . So it goes in the march of the patriots . When Casper Williams came to his office in the saloon , Joe Diamond puked right on his own floor without any warning when Williams told him whom he was supposed to hit . He had never really been scared before in his life , he decided . He had to go to bed for a day and a half . After a while he got used to the idea , because the money they were paying was so good and because he would be working for Captain Heller , who had never made a wrong move in his life.  |p169SUNDAY  NIGHT , FEBRUARY 3 , 1974-CLEVELANDThe cigar smoke in the back of the parked Cadillac in Vincent Street was like suspended meringues , but Nick could n't open the window , because the engine was n't running and the windows were automatic .

Mentor leaned forward and turned on the ignition , then he opened the windows on both sides . " This is an eighty-fivecentcigar , fahcrissakes , " he said . " Wholesale . " " Who was Casper Williams ? " " A Hollywood agent . " " Whaaaat ? " " Yeah , he was dealing for Harry Small , head of the Federal Studios . " " Why would people like that want a President killed ? " " Because that particular President cost them about fifty million dollars in film rentals when Ellamae Irving , who was Federal 's biggest star , killed herself because the President told her she could n't go to a Madison Square Garden rally for him in New York . " " Hardly likely . " " Very likely . He was screwing her , and she took it big . Maybe she had dreams of being the First Lady . That could have made her the biggest grosser in history , even if it was only announced .

" Nick got out of the Cadillac and got into a cab across the street in front of the Odeon ( : rill I lc told the driver to take him to the airport . Irving Mentor got out of the hack of the car , shut the door , %tarteel to open the front door and felt the gun irr his hack.  |p170MONDAY  , FEBRUARY 4 , 1974-NEW YORKNick called Yvette in New York from the Cleveland airport at 12:55 A.M. The answering service said she still had n't called in for her messages . He was getting cross-eyed with fury over her perversity . Why was it that only the women one loved behaved like this and never the women one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York at six twenty in the morning . He checked into an airport motel and left a call for half past ten . At eleven thirty he was riding the high-speed elevator in the National Magazine building to get some kind of a reasonableexplanation from Harry Greenwood as to why the magazine had sent him to a man in Cleveland who , according to the unimpeachablesource of Frank Mayo , did not exist as far as the Syndicate was concerned . Nick wanted to have Greenwood 's undoubtedlyplausible explanation in hand when he made his report to his father about the Mentor meeting . His name was sent along to Greenwood 's office from the editorial reception desk . After about seven minutes he was told Mr. Greenwood would be unable to see him . Was there someone else who could help him ? " Perhaps his secretary does n't know I had a meeting with Mr. Greenwood here two nights ago . I am Thomas Kegan 's son . " The receptionist repeated Nick 's message to Mr. Greenwood 's secretary . There was a short wait , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , please . A young woman was waiting for him at the elevator bank . " Mr. Thirkield ? " He followed her to the uptown side of the building at the eastern end . She led him into an anteroom just as a portly man with heavy eyeglasses and an imperturbable look came through from the far room . " This is Mr. Thirkield , " the young woman said . " What 's this about a meeting we had ? " the man asked . " I 'm here to see Harry Greenwood . " " I 'm Greenwood . " " Like hell you are , " Nick said pleasantly , managing to smile.  | " Hey , Charlotte , " the portly man yelled . The young woman reappeared . " Who am I ? " he asked . " You are Mr. Harry Greenwood . " Greenwood said to Nick , " And you 're Tim Kegan 's brother ? " Nick nodded with bewilderment . " Sit down , " Greenwood said . " No . You better come inside and tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lined with cork to which productionschedules , assignment sheets and oddly shaped pieces of paper were pinned . " Do you have a writer named Chantal Lamers ? " Nick asked . " On our staff ? " " Yes . " " No . " " No ? " " You 'd better tell me what happened . " Nick told him how he had met Miss Lamers , who said she worked for the magazine . She had given him her direct-to-desk telephone . The magazine did have direct-to-desk phones ? Greenwoodnodded . Nick had called Miss Lamers to arrange a meeting . In an office two floors below , off a corridor behind the reception desk , she had introduced him to a man she called Harry Greenwood , who said he was the editor of the National Magazine . He gave a careful description of Lamers and the false Greenwood . " What was the meeting about ? " " I ca n't say until I clear it with my father . But you have been very helpful . Thank you very much . " Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on East Thirty-first Street . The doorman was a ratty , if beautifully uniformed , short man who did not look strong enough to protect the tenants from the neighborhood children . Ile barred the way . He said no one named Chantal Lamers lived iu the building . Nick asked him how longp172he had worked there . The doorman said three and a half years . Nick gave him three one-dollar bills and described Chantal carefully . The doorman shrugged and said they just did n't have any good-looking tenants of any name anywhere in the building . " I do n't say this as criticism , buddy , " the doorman said , trying to earn the three bucks , " but we have never had a pretty woman live in this building . There could be a jinx on this building . " Nick went to the Walpole Hotel . He felt dazed . Two people who were as convincing in their ways as any two people he had ever met had melted away as if they had never existed . Yet he knew Chantal Lamers existed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too solid flesh , which was incapable of thawing and resolving itself into a dew . Why had she done it ? Where was the point of doing what she had done ? Whatever her reason , when could it have been planned ?  --  because everything that had happened between them had been accidental . Her car had been wrecked . Her forehead had been cut . The garageman at the crossroads that bore the improbable name of Jane Garnet 's Corners , on the Muskogee road , had volunteered the information about the two stoned men who had driven her off the road . She had n't called him in New York , he had called her . He had wanderedcompletely out of her life ; then , because he had told her what he thought he needed , she had taken him to the National Magazineoffices and had produced the magazine 's confidential files bearing the cabalistic marks of the magazine 's staff . Then , absolutelyauthentically , she had fallen in love with him . How , or why , or because of what absurdity should she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw anything wrong with simple lust anymore . Subterfuges were silly when two adults wanted to couple for pleasure . Why had any of it happened ? It had no shape . It made no sense . What had made any sense since he left Brunei ? Keifetz was dead . Nick still could not overtake that terrible fact . Keifetz was dead . One-third of the people in theworld who gave a damn about him had been a big breakfast forp173a shark . Nick knew it was his fault . Keifetz was his friend . If Keifetz had been less of his friend he could be alive . Miles , Tate , Kullers , Sis Ryan and Coney were all dead , as if they had all been playing cards together and he had thrown a live grenade in among them . They had one thing in common and it caused their death : they all knew Nicholas Thirkield . But why was he still alive , eluding such expert killers , who had put away twenty-three people , including Tim ? Where was the missing piece ? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost fifteen years , that he was wandering around in a steam room , causing the deaths of all the indistinct shapes he happened to bump into ? He was - on some kind of a bummer through American mythology , a demigod . Look at the folks : Dawson , the world 's richest and most spectacular recluse ; Ellamae Irving , a suicidal movie queen ; Mayo , a grand vizier of the underworld . It was all so vulgar , with illusion and falsehood used to construct dwellings of steam , buildingson wheels which had rolled him up streets , down corridors . Turk Fletcher had faded into Captain Heller who became Z. K. Dawson who resolved into Chantal Lamers who blended into a dead kitten and an English hit man until all of them fused into Casper Junior who was William Casper or was it Casper Williams . Everyone disappeared almost as soon as he began to talk to them . Someone , somewhere was trying to teach him futility . This came to him with the clarity of a night ball game  --  shadowless and static . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far , only one pattern seemed to exist : a pattern of confusion and exhaustion intended to teach him that all striving was fruitless , that when he understood the futility , he would find peace and safety for the people he loved . If that were so , he had to find Yvette and keep her with him . He felt smothered by the terrible fear that these people in the shadows around him were capable of doing to Yvette what they had done to Keifetz and twenty-two others . But if he was on this hummer through a fun house of the American myths , surelyp174Pa 's money could save them  --  Yvette and himself  --  surely Pa 's money was the magic cloak that could cover them and let them survive any darkness ? He left the elevator at the tower floor , opened the door of the apartment and walked into the foyer . Keifetz was asleep in a large chair that had been placed to face the door . There was a large manila envelope in his lap . Nick stared at him . Nausea hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came to his feet reflexively in one leap , recognizedNick as he focused and said , " Jesus , I thought you 'd never get here , baby . "  |p175TUESDAY  , JANUARY 29 , 1974-BRUNEINick worked it all out by getting hysterical . He sobbed uncontrollably . Keifetz led him into Tim 's bathroom and put his head under the cold-water shower . Nick stopped weeping . He dried himself off . " What happened ? " he asked Keifetz . " I was driving to the office with the radio on , " Keifetz said , " when they announced that Tate and Sis Ryan had been killed in that automobile accident . I knew right away what kind of an accident that was . So I got on the radio phone in the car and called Daisy and told her to meet me at Fong 's  --  that 's kind of a , you know , kind of a coffee place  --  and to keep her mouth shut . I told her to bring every dime there was in petty cash . This cost you about thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nick said . " I 'm going to charge it to my father . " " When she got there I explained that Tate and Sis had been murdered and that if I just went on about my business I would be next . Now , I know you do n't know Daisy , but she is a terrific woman . She can do anything and she has the nerve of ten Apaches . I told her that you and your father were working on the thing that had caused the murders of Tate and Sis , and that it was all in the deposition Tate and Sis had taken at the hospital with us . She was hip . So I told her to go to Tate 's office and say casually that she had come by to pick up the favor Tate had done for me  --  she knows Tate 's secretary very well  --  then to go to Sergeant Ali Kushandra at the cops and to say , nice and easy , that I had sent her over to pick up Fletcher 's prints and photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fong 's  --  you can get rooms there besides coffee  --  and I told her to bring everything back to me . " Daisy knows you 're alive ? " " She got me out . " " But she was so stricken with grief on the telephone she could hardly talk . " " She 's a terrific woman , Nick . I just told her she had to stayvery convincing . Also , she could have thought I 'd be killed tryingp176to get this deposition here . She likes me . We 're going to be married . " Daisy walked to the Shell offices , then to police headquarters , then to Fong 's . She was a small , pretty and dazzlingly **28;1060;TOOLONG woman from the Philippine archipelago whose father had been an American GI who came in with the occupying forces on March 2 , 1945 . Her father , who owned a Shell station in the Oranges , New Jersey , had paid for her educationwith the nuns in Brunei . She was nineteen years old . She was the embodiment of Christopher Colombo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a route to the East Indies , where gold was in abundance " to a degree scarcely credible " and " sweet scented trees like sandalwood and camphor , pepper , nutmegs , spikenard , galangal , cubebs , cloves and all other valuable spices abounded . " Keifetz locked the door . He patted her softly on the behind , took the envelope from her and sat down at a table . " Will they try to kill you , sir ? " " Goddammit , Daisy , do n't call me sir . ' Yes , they will kill me if they can find me . But that 's okay , is n't it ? " " Yes , sir . They will not find you . " He stopped opening the envelope . " Come here . " She approached . He sat her on his lap as if she were a toy . " Are you sure you understand that we are going to get married , Daisy ? " " Oh , yes . " " Then you must n't call me sir . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will not call you sir , ' " Daisy said . " What will you call me ? " " How about baby ' ? " " Not baby . ' Too cold . How about Your Eminence ' ? " " Yes , " she sighed . " That fits you best . It is a wonderful private name . "  |p177He  kissed her enthusiastically , then lifted her off his lap . It was five minutes to seven . The sun was up and very hot . He checked through the pages of the deposition , checked the fingerprints and photographs . " Everything is here , " he said . " Sis was a good legal stenographer . This is what we do , Daisy . On the way out , tell Fong to send me up some tea . Then go out to my place with a cardboard box , pack me a change of clothes in it and send it by air mail to General Delivery in Hong Kong . And bring me the pistol . Okay ? " " Sure . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  did you bring the money ? " " Sure . " " How much was in petty cash ? " " Thirty-five hundred dollars . " " I have to speak to Nick about switching the petty cash to Swiss francs . " " What about the boat ? " " I do n't know . Except I ca n't leave by plane . They 'd have somebody waiting for me when I landed . So I have to go by boat , a private boat , at night . They would expect me to head for the Singapore airport , so that 's out . " " Hong Kong is out too , sir . If it is n't Singapore , they 'll think of Hong Kong . " " If it 's more than one airport , they 'll have to check passenger manifests , so I ca n't travel with this passport . What name should I use ? " " Gary Cooper ! " He fell about with laughter . She laughed so hard she had to lean against the wall . When she could speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin 's boat to my island , I can send you to people who will get you to Manila by plane , then you can fly out from there . Where are you going , sir ? "  | " To San Francisco , then I make a call to Palm Springs and they tell me where to go . Wherever Nick is . " " I get your clothes . " Daisy left . " I will mail them to General Delivery , Manila , okay ? " " No , they could miss me . Make it registered air mail , care of General Delivery , San Francisco . " " But if you are all the way to San Francisco in those clothes , you can buy clothes in San Francisco . " " That 's right . Therefore just go down and tell Fong to send up some tea and come right back . " " But what about the pistol ? " " No . Fong will have to get me a pistol . You and I have to plan my death here in Brunei today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper and radio . " " I will get the tea , sir , while you think . " When she came back with the tea he had it all figured out . They sipped tea . He explained . " You go back to the office and call Gelbart in from the Number One rig . He is the safest man and he 's a foreman . When Gelbart gets to the office you hand him a note I am going to give you in my own writing , which he will dig , telling him to come here to Fong 's . When he gets here I am going to let him read the deposition , because he feels almost the same way I feel about Tim Kegan and the people who killed him . Maybe he 's not a nut about it like me , but killing Kegan was a very important thing in his life as an American . Okay . Gelbart goes back to Number One supposedly at about eleven , because you put him down in the book for a seat on the eleven o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twelve thirty and order a seat in the chopper for me to go out to Number One at about two o'clock , just before the rain starts . " " But , sir  --  " " No , it 's all right . Because the two o'clock chopper is the one Gelbart will actually take . He wo n't be aboard the eleven o'clock . He goes out to Number One in my seat , wearing my rain rigs . Then at about seven o'clock at night  --  Number One is aboutp179thirty miles out at sea  --  when the rain is really coming down , he radios to you at the base that I slipped on the deck of the rig and went over the side in shark-infested waters , and because the seas were too heavy and there was no sign of me , they did n't attempt any rescue operation . Okay ? " " Oh , very good , sir ! " " Now , most people know we are crazy about each other , so when you get the news you have to be sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I know you will do it cor-rectly . " " We weep . " " Well , as far as I 'm concerned you ca n't overdo it . " " I will make terrible scenes , sir . " " But first tell the police and tell the newspaper and the radio station . Then announce that the office will be closed for two days in mourning . Then you stay right beside my desk and files and post strong security inside and outside the building . Just wait for Nick or Carswell to call , and tell them everything , but do n't remember to call them , because you are too grieved . " Keifetz listened to his own obituary on the eight o'clock , nine o'clock and ten o'clock news that night , and , all in all , he was n't too displeased . If he had known the station would go into such detail , he might have remembered to tell Daisy to slip into his biography that he had gone to Harvard and had once won a Bollingen Award for poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people in Brunei . He got into Fong 's cousin 's boat at eleven fifteen . It was a compact hydrofoil used to smuggle whiskey to the Mohamn1e dans in the area and transistor electric shavers that fetishists adored using on pubic hair . They ran through the Balabac Strait , then along the south side of Palawan to Puerto Princesa , a distance of about 437 statute miles . They got into Puerto Princvsa at a quarter to six the next evening , with Keifetz ' teeth hangingout from the banging by the sea . Fong charged him only fivep180hundred dollars each way ( the cousin had to get back to Brunei without a tooth in his head ) , which was a steal . Manila was only four hundred and eighty miles to the northeast , Puerto Princesa had an airfield , and a good old workhorse Beechcraft got him to the Manila airport at eleven the next morning after a marvelous night 's sleep . Keifetz could speak Tagalog . Daisy had sent ahead such an exalted description of his position in the world , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to him . A chief had to be summoned so that Keifetz could find a place to sleep and to make sure he got the plane into Manila . He slept sublimely on the flight into San Francisco and felt wonderfully refreshed especially when he called Palm Springs and was told that Nick was in New York . But he met a young woman in an airport Pancake Parlor , checked in with her at the airport hotel and got himself exhausted all over again . Then he went on to New York.  |p181MONDAY  , FEBRUARY 4 , 1974-NEW YORKKeifetz said , " You do n't look so good . " " I was wondering if it is possible that all the others might come back to life . " " What others ? Tate and Sis Ryan really caught it . " " Miles Gander is dead . " " Miles ? You connected him with this  --  this business ? " Nick nodded . " He went with me when we found the rifle . It was where Fletcher said it would be , but the police inspector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room where the rifle was hidden , and there was a tenant who worked in the room  --  so they all saw the rifle and now they are all dead . " " Why ? " " The rifle has disappeared . No rifle , no witnesses to finding the rifle , just my unsupported story . " " How come you got away ? " " Somebody tried to poison me in Tulsa . I could say I 'm pretty sure it was Z. K. Dawson , but the trouble is , it 's too open and shut . Nothing else about any of this is open and shut . Then somebody sent a professional killer to throw me out of that win-dow . " " But he did n't . " " I have thought about that a lot . I mean , I 'm no puny weakling in the Charles Atlas ad , but this guy was a trained **27;1090;TOOLONG warrior . I mean , he had every advantage  --  surprise , intent , weapons , strength and experience  --  and yet , somehow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " These people have never been shy about killing . I am the key gofer in all of this  --  the low man , the goddamn messenger who 's here to go-fer things . How come they have n't killed me ? I 'll tell how come . They do n't need to kill me , and they absolutely will not kill me . Why do n't they need to kill me ? " " I was just going to ask you that , " Keifetz said . " Better yet , why are they going to such fantastic trouble and expense to confuse me RI tire me out ? "  | " They want you to quit . " " Sure . But not just quit . They want me to quit satisfied that nothing in this world can be done about it , what 's the use , that 's the way it is , et cetera , et cetera . " " Well , that 's the permanent policy the people who own this country have for all the rest of the population , Nicholas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it , but even if someone might call you a co-owner , it looks like , in this , you 're just one of the rest of the electorate . After all , on the inside , oligarchies are mutually feuding structures , right ? And maybe the guys who are teaching you that famous what's-the-use philosophy are with that same mob , those other fellas who own the country ? " " Keifetz , did you have to go to a Marxist Sunday group when you were a kid ? " " I do n't answer tricky questions like that . " " Then what makes you so smart ? Come on  --  what Marxist Sunday group did they make you go to ? " " It 's Marxist study group . It was n't a Sunday school , fahcrissake . To a socialist worker , what is a Sunday school ? It is manipulationby the bosses to interfere with the day of rest . " " I 'm glad you went , no kidding . Somebody is trying to teach me futility as a way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old as the first economic figure in American history  --  you know , one of the basic truths that is always revived as needed . " " What basic truth ? " Keifetz asked belligerently . " That there are a handful of people who own the country and who stay in power by teaching everybody else that all striving is fruitless , that there is no use fighting it  --  no way  --  that what'sthe-useis the only helpful permanent attitude to have in life . " " Now who was the member of the Marxist Sunday group ? " Keifetz asked accusingly . " The thing is , whoever is teaching me futility this year also killed Tim in 196o . They were able to get close enough to him to kill him ; therefore they have to be some of the people who ranp183him . Let 's try on some questions . Why did Z. K. Dawson agree to see me ? " " Your old man asked him . " Keifetz ' head was as bald as a kneecap , as brown as a GI boot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that comical moustache , and the mock-kindly look of Field Marshal Lord Montgomery of Alamein just after he had consumed a regimental sergeant major and two field ranks for breakfast . He held his mouth pressed together in a permanent expression of belligerence , giving him the look of a prizefighter who was making sure his mouthpiece would n't fall out . He was a head taller than Nick , a foot wider and eighteen inches thicker . His voice had overtones of a crocodile with severe indigestion . " That 's not why . " " Why , then ? " " He agreed to see me so that he could pass me along to the next set of phony clues . So they could plant a woman on me named Chantal Lamers , who then set up the third set of phony clues like in a leapfrog game . " " Are you saying the guy in Cleveland was a phony ? " " Frank Mayo says he does n't even exist . " " Do me a favor and start from the beginning . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I think Tim is alive and well and living in Argentina . " " Just say what happened . " " I got to London , and Carswell was so absolutely impossible that there can no longer be any question about it  --  he has to go . " " Later , later . Tell me about Philly . " " Okay . Breakfast with Miles . Miles dug up a high-ranking cop . Now , it just happens to work out that fourteen years ago this same cop was in on Tim 's murder so deep that he is definitely one of the bad guys . " " Then what ? " " We find the rifle . The cop  --  who is named Frank Heller  --  very plausibly takes the rifle to the police lab  --  he says  --  except that it never got near the lab . I Idler must have tried to blackmailp184somebody with the rifle , because that same night he was killed . " " Jesus . " " Pa set a meeting with Z. K. Dawson in Tulsa . Dawson gave nothing away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case that Tim was good for his business and that the last thing he wanted was to have Tim dead . " " You believe him ? " " I do n't see how I can believe anybody . This Casper Junior that Fletcher told us about is all over this thing . He pops up in every nook and cranny of the goddam thing , but I 'm no closer to finding out who he was . But he 's heavy Texas , and I have to think that he was acting for Dawson , who is very heavy Texas . I did find out that the Philadelphia police were deep into Tim 's murder , but Heller is dead . Joe Diamond , the nightclub saloonkeeper , left his muddy footprints everywhere , and I have no doubt that he did everything Fletcher said he did , including shoot Willie Arnold , but he 's dead . Willie Arnold , who played Jesus to the Pickering Commission 's Pontius Pilate , is dead . It looks like we know everything but we ca n't prove anything , does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did they invent a woman named Chantal Lamers , who took me to a fake editor of the National Magazine , who arranged for me to interview this very dubious Cleveland mobster , who produced a detailed story that the movie industry had had Tim killed ? " " How did they get in ? Jesus , no wonder there was such a crowd in Hunt Plaza in Philly that day . " " Tim had been laying a movie woman named Ellamae Irving , you know the one , and  --  " " Do I know the one ? Boyoboy ! " " So the way the story goes from this hoodlum , she killed herself because Tim would n't make her First Lady of the Land , and because that cost some movie company fifty million dollars , they had Tim killed . " " It does n't sound right . I can see how certain guys might missp185her , but I do n't see them shooting the President of the United States for her . For one thing , they hate to leave Beverly Hills . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime partner of Heller 's  --  admits that the police opened all the doors for the assassins , but he says they had nothing else to do with the killing . He says the Mob , either on its own or on hire , actually did the work . So I went to what I was told were the editors of the National Magazine to find me a top mobster . " " But you said you knew Frank Mayo . " " My father knew him , but I did n't know then that my father knew him , or at least I did n't know it until after the magazine had made the hoodlum connection . " " You should have known your old man woulda known Frank Mayo , Nicholas . " " Please , stay with me . We both talked to Turk Fletcher . He was just a Texas farmer . I mean , nobody would say Turk Fletcher was a member of the Mafia or the Syndicate or anything like that . " " Why not ? Look at Farmer Rappaport . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Campbell Soup Company until he got a job with Lepke in Murder , Inc . My old man was a bushelman in the garment district  --  that 's below Thirty-first Strut . That Farmer Rappaport was a real organizationman . " " For Christ 's sake ! We are fitting a puzzle together ! I am saying that it is sensible to reason that if the Mob was in this , they were not acting independently for their own reasons . It is logical that whoever hired Turk Fletcher also may have contacted the Syndicate to hire the other rifleman . If I could find out who hired Joe Diamond , then I 'd know who hired Fletcher , and we 'd have this all wrapped up . " " So what happened ? " " I found out that is what they wanted me to think , so that who n the whole tfaing collapsed I would have been taught another lesson in futility . "  | " But how did you find out the broad and the editor were phonies ? " " I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . Then I went to Chantal Lamers ' building . I found out she never lived there . Then I came here to find you doing your famous impression of The Resurrection and The Light . How do you figure this mess out ? " " I agree with you that they are trying to teach you that anything you do is just going to be futile and hopeless . The owners always do it that way . It has worked for them since the Civil War , so they know it will work with you . " " I have n't even been here a week , " Nick said . " I sure have n't been here long enough to figure out any policy . " " There is only one policy . " " If you know it , tell it . " " Do n't take any more outside leads like Lamers ' or anybody else 's . Run everything through your old man . He probably has an organization bigger than the Common Market . And on a thing like Tim 's murder he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Pa . He told Nick to get right over to the hospital because Frank Mayo was on his way . Nick did n't mention Keifetz ' being alive . He hung up and said , " God knows , I 'm happy and grateful that you 're alive . " " Okay . So get maudlin . " " So would you if they told you I had been killed by those bastards , " Nick flared up . " Of course . But I 'm a Russian Jew . You 're a WASP . It does n't look nice for you . " He fingered his moustache , grinned broadly and farted . " Keifetz , come on . Quit horsing around . The fact is , I am going to need you badly before we get out of this thing , so what I 'm saying is , the fewer people who know you are still alive , the better . That includes my father , because he talks all the time , and too many people could find out about it . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So wait till it 's dark before you leave here . Then take the elevator to the cellar and go out through the help 's exit . Oh , shit ! " " Whatsamatta ? " " The hotel desk and the manager know you are here , and they file a minute-by-minute log with my father . " " No . I do n't know if I thought of that , but they have n't got my real name . I told them I was from the police commissioner 's office in Philadelphia . I told them my name was Trudeman Gar-funkel . " " Great . That 's great ! Now I have time to make up a lie . When you get out of here , check into the Waldorf so I can find you . It 's just better for you to stay dead a little while longer . " When Nick got to the hospital Pa grandstanded for him by pulling a flat package out from under his pillow and saying , " Here . That 's the fifteen grand you gave that fink last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nick was n't as surprised as he would have been earlier  --  he had a good sense of Pa now . " Yeah . You know what he is , this big wheel in the Syndicate ? An actor . But what kind of an actor ? An out-of-work actor in blue movies . " Who hired him ? " " The tape he made for you is with Jim Cerutti now . So is the tape he made with my men who had the talk with him . Cerutti will put it all together . " " The whole peg they tried to hang everything on , " Nick said , " was that Tim had been killed by a movie company . " " They must think we 're feebleminded ! " Pa said . " And they 're so careless . Just a cursory check would have showed them that a few of my companies own forty-six percent of Federal Studios . Ellainae Irving was n't worth any fifty million dollars in film rentalsI listened to that Mentor tape . It was fulla false notes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whodial of a broken heart . Ellamae is supposed to have killed herselfp188because Tim threw her over . But life just did n't work that way with her . And Harry Small had three stars bigger than her  --  at the box office , that is . Also Harry Small was the kind of a guy who kept so busy that if he was alive right now he might not know Ellamae had killed herself . " " Maybe she did n't kill herself , " Nick persisted . " Maybe she 's just another one of the twenty-odd people who have died because Tim was killed . " " Do n't believe it , " Pa said . " First of all , she died a year ahead of Tim . Second , like every other suicide , she had been a suicide inside her head since she was about five years old . " " Okay , " Nick said . " Who hired Mentor ? " " The Casper Williams name again . Same description . The interesting thing is the Joe Diamond background they gave Mentorto give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the funny thing was  --  " Rose put her head in the doorway . " Mr. Mayo is here , " she said , smiling broadly . " Send him in , you beautiful thing , " Pa said . Frank Mayo came in and shook hands with Pa and Nick heartily . " Whatever it is you 've got , " Pa said , " Eve and Rose like it . " " The feeling is entirely mutual , " Mr. Mayo said . " I got a big surprise for you , " Pa said . " It 'll turn you into a Sicilian again . I got a case of Corvo di Castellodaccio  --  with four bottles waiting , lightly chilled , right now  --  to go with  --  ready ?  --  hey ?  --  crispeddi di riso alla Benedittina , nice and hot , right out of the microwave . I flew them in on my own plane from Catania . " " Holy Jezuss , Mr. Kegan ! " " Okay , girls ! " Pa yelled . Eve and Rose rolled the Salton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cooler . She filled the glasses while Mr. Mayo was tasting the crispeddi and moaning . " I got four dozen of those deep-frozen for you , " Pa said , smilingwith great pleasure . After ten minutes of eating and drinking , Pa said , " Nick isp189dying to hear the real story on Joe Diamond . " To Nick he said , " Frank heard both the Irving Mentor tapes . " Mr. Mayo cleared his throat . " Well , sure , Diamond come from aronn Cleveland originally . He worked for Gameboy Baker in some of Moey 's joints , but he never worked in Cuba . He was inna war even . He was infantry in Germany . " " Tim was in Germany , " Pa said . " When he come outta the army he was in Chicago , and him and Max Davidoff got the okay to take over the Grocery and Office Used Box and Paper local after Eddie Brinkman was shot . Davidoff was international president and Diamond was internationalfirst vice-president . It was a good thing for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand a year . That 's where he saved up to open a joint in Philly . Davidoff had a son-in-law who was a real hustler in the insurance business , and Davidoff was very solid with Vonnie Blanik , the international president of the Tubesters , and he made a good deal with Blanik to shove the union insurance through the kid , and there was so much for everybody that Davidoff sold his piece of the Used Box and Paper local to Diamond , and Davidoff moved to Detroit . Whenever this is who killed our President wanted to buy somebody to do it , he went to Blanik , because  --  which every little kid onna street knows  --  Blanik hated Tim Kegan more than anybody in the United States , he thought , up until then . Lissen , your brother kept after him , put him in jail , made a monkey of him , called him a crook to his own men , his men that were proud of their crook ! Blanik saw how he could hit our President and not get any trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1959-DETROITJoe Diamond always liked to see Murray Davidoff , a man the Sicilians always called Max for no reason whatsoever , and he always liked to go to Detroit because of the time they had given Elvis Presley his suite at the Book-Cadillac , and by the time they got Presley out of there and he had gone in , very exhausted , while he was having a room-service meal in the living room , four little broads had sneaked into the bedroom without him knowing anything about it . They thought Presley still stayed there . When he threw them out one of them stole his pajama bottoms . The idea of four little broads climbing twenty-one flights of service stairs hoping to get laid by Elvis Presley disgusted him . In fact , when he found one of them still hiding in his room after he had had dinner , he felt like throwing up . But he knew that somewhere in Detroit his pajama bottoms were probably tacked up on the wall of some little broad 's room and that they would stay with her for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was why he liked Detroit . So when Murray Davidoff invited him to Detroit he was glad to go . Murray met him at the airport . They drove to Murray 's house for a real New England boiled dinner , which , thank God , was boiled flanken , chicken , and tongue with horseradish , and not just corned beef with a lot of boiled vegetables , like plenty of places tried to palm off . Gloria Davidoff was a nice little cook even if she could n't stand him . After dinner Cary Davidoff , who was fourteen and who was going to be a song writer when he grew up , played sixteen or fifty of his latest tunes and sang them in the style of Eddie Fisher , or it could have been Eddie Cantor . When Cary finished , with his mother smirking all over everything , Murray took out the watch from the grateful members of the Used Box and Paper local when he had retired and told Diamond that Vonnie Blanik wanted to meet him . Diamond had never met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most famous man in the American labor movement . It gave him the stab of a thrill . For more than three yearshe had been consumed with the idea of organizing a nationalp191police union . When Murray had sold him the Box and Paper local to join up on Vonnie Blanik 's personal staff , Diamond had tried to get up the nerve to lay the proposition on Murray to have him lay it on Blanik . But who could trust Murray or Blanik ? Diamond knew that if he could be international president of a national police union , with an international charter from the Tubesters , he would like practically come in his pants twice every day . But he knew all the stories about Blanik . They were greedy stories . Diamondwas not greedy . He would take care of Blanik and Murray . He did n't care about money in this instance . The restaurant and the shit traffic in Philadelphia were throwing off plenty . His goal was a national police union . They drove to the Tubesters ' national headquarters . It was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his personal office anteroom , but because of a lot of trouble the Justice Department had made with a wire tap they had put on Vonnie 's car telephone and which he had just found out about , he and Murray only got to see Vonnie for about two minutes , if that . And it was something Joe Diamond could just as well have postponed for a week , he thought , while the meeting was happening . Vonnie grabbed him by the necktie , which meant he had to reach away up to get to Diamond 's necktie , because Blanik was no giant  --  in fact maybe even the opposite . He pulled down hard on the necktie , so Diamond had to bend way over while Vonnie was standing straight up . Vonnie yelled straight into his face , " You do what Murray tells you , you hear , you fink ? " He put the heel of his hand on Diamond 's chin and pushed . He ran out of the room . " What kind of a meeting was that ? " Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very upset . The White House is persecuting him . " " What did I do ? I did n't even vote for Kegan . " " Do n't worry . I know Vonnie . You 'll sec. lie will feel terrible and he 'll send you a gold cigarette case . "  |p192Murray  drove them to his son-in-law 's office building downtown . On the way Murray explained how Kegan never let up on Vonnie . There were twenty-four hours a day of pressure because Kegan was out to break up the American labor movement . If Vonnie had n't been made of iron he would have had a complete breakdown long ago . Never , Murray said , had one man  --  and that included Hitler  --  persecuted another man the way Kegan was persecuting Vonnie Blanik . Diamond was n't listening . He was thinking about what Murray had said about Blanik making it up to him . This could mean an opening . He might get a chance to present his idea , his ideal , with maybe also a chance to break even on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son-in-law 's building . The kid had a whole seven-story building on a Tubesters ' mortgage . There were two bent-noses waiting for Murray in the cellar . Murray introduced them . The first was Herm Levin  --  Hermie the Mole , a legend ! The other man was Silk Gabel , who looked like a jewelry salesman Joe knew in Philadelphia . They did n't say much . Everybody sat down . It was like being in the whoopee room of somebody 's house . Murray offered a drink . The Mole and Gabel , who were sitting on either side of Diamond on a green plastic sofa , did n't take any . Joe took a Seven-Up . Murray sat behind a dinky wooden desk . He said , " I know you must be wondering why I invited you all the way to Detroit , Joe . " He had a very soft voice , because Murray lived on tranquilizers , and was therefore very considerate . " Listen , it 's great to see you again , Murr . " " Vonnie has this friend who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Diamond nodded because he could n't think of anything to say . " So he asked me to find the best man to help this friend out . So when I heard what it was , I immediately thought of you . " " It 's nice to hear it . " " I want you to do a special job for this fellow , the friend of Vonnie's. "  | " A job ? " " A hit . " " You called me all the way to Detroit for a hit when an absolute legend for hits is sitting right beside me ? " " Joe , the job is so special that it has to be somebody who is not connected in any way , shape or form . You are a man who comes out of the labor movement , who is a respected restaurant owner and a friend of the entire Philadelphia police department , and a man who never made a political statement in his entire life . " " Why political , Murr ? " " The contract is for a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ta make something clear . This is not Vonnie 's contract . It is not my contract . And certainly , God forbid , it has nothing to do with the International Tubesters ' Union . " " Who 's contract is it ? " " This friend of Vonnie 's . " " Who gets hit ? " Diamond liked all this talking and he did n't like it . He did n't like it , because Murray was stretching everything out like he could n't bring himself to say who the politician was , which could be bad . But he was making such a thing out of it that the contract had to be very important to Blanik . Since the big necktie greeting he did n't like Blanik , but life was n't a popularity contest , and Blanik could issue a charter for a national police union . Joe lighted a big cigar , very calm . Murray waited for him . He puffed on the cigar . He said , " What politician , Murray ? " " Tim Kegan . " Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at top speed . Gabel shoved his foot out . Diamond fell down . Murray said , " Just take it easy , Joe . " Diamond got up and brushed himself off . He did n't look at Gabel . I le did n't look at anybody . Murray said , " You did n't give me a chance to tell you , but we have the total cooperation of the Philadelphia police . " That was Diamond 's heartland . " Which police ? "  | " Captain Heller of the Political Squad . " Diamond sat down on a wooden chair . " Frank Heller ? " " I think so . " Diamond puffed on the cigar elaborately . He was thinking and he did n't care who knew it . He had a feeling . If he handled this right he would get his charter . They were handing him the keys themselves . If he had gone to Murray with the idea , without them begging him for something , Blanik would have given the charter to some stooge . He , Yussel Diamond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . But even if they did n't know it , they had just made him international president . He had to make it very hard for them . He had to make them persuade him so that he could later on bargain and set a compromise . He said , " I wo n't do it , Murray . " Levin and Gabel got up from the sofa and took off their jackets . They kept their hats on . Both men were classy dressers . Classy dressers are dainty about everything . They might be willing to shoot him , but they would n't beat him up , because it made a big mess . Gabel dragged out a galvanized washtub full of water . He poured in a third of a bag of cement . He dragged the tub to Diamond 's chair and put Joe 's legs in the water  --  feet , shoes , socks and the bottoms of his pants . Gabel stirred it all up , then poured more cement in . " Stir with your feet , " Gabel said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignantly . " He ruined my suit and my shoes . " After a while , the way Gabel worked , the cement got very thick all around Joe 's legs . " Murray ! " Diamond said . " What are you doing ? " " Joe , I am personally sorry , " Murray said with that soft voice . " We are going to leave you down here to think everything over for about twenty-four hours . If you decide it is yes , then with the shoes and the pants it wo n't hurt so much when we knock the cement off . " " What is this if ? " Diamond asked  | " It 's up to you , Joe . " The three men left . Diamond felt scaled with bitterness that Murray could do this to him . He could have assigned it . They had been good friends for eleven years and he could have assigned it . He reconsidered , because he had plenty of time . Maybe Murray figured he would take the deal right away . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked him for what was essentially a very big job . In a way it was the rottenest twenty-four hours Diamond had ever spent  --  from the view of physical discomfort . But he was able to stay happy mentally . He kept himself euphoric , and sexually excited , with the thoughts of being the head man among all the police in the United States . He would be on a first-name basis with four hundred thousand local police and with troopers in every state of the union , except never mind Hawaii and Alaska because he hated long flights . Wherever he went in God 's country he would have pals , people he really cared about . He thought , Jesus , there will have to be plenty of situations where they get themselves in such jams that only I can get them out . They will have to be grateful . They will have to like me . They will understand me and I will understand them . So in a lot of ways it was n't the rottenest twenty-four hours he ever spent . Except he wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were right on time . The mechanics sat on the plastic sofa , facing him . Murray went behind the crappy desk again like he was some kind of honest used-car dealer . " What did you decide , Joe ? " Murray said , a kindly man . " I have a conditional answer , Murr . " " What kind of conditional answer , Joe ? " " First : yes , I will do that certain job for you . " Murray slammed his hands together . " Wonderful , Joe ! " " Rut I will only do it if Vonnie Blanik will do something forme . " " Vonnie has nothing to do with this . " And Murray was suddenlynot the kindly man.  | " I want a charter  --  I mean a charter made out to me as internationalpresident  --  a charter from the International Tubesters Unionthat gives only me the right to organize a national police union . " Silence followed . After a while Murray poured a drink  --  one large bourbon . Someday he was going to take a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray , Diamondthought . " That is what I call an idea , " Murray said . " It has so many angles I am dizzy already . Let me make a call . It might take an hour or two , because Vonnie ca n't use the phones . Okay ? " " Certainly . " " The boys will keep you company . " " Do n't bother . Hey , just a minute . When does the cement come off ? It does n't feel so good , believe me . " " Take it off , Herm , " Murray said and left the cellar . Diamond found out why there were two men . Gabel put the cement on . Levin took the cement off . They had to have a union . Blanik must have given them a charter . The job took almost two hours . His shoes and pants were a wreck , never mind his socks . Levin had a pack of cards , so they played klob until Murray got back . He was jovial all over . " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vonnie admires you for that idea . The charter will be in your name . " " A dream realized is all I can say , " Diamond told them . " And I was right about the gold cigarette case . It 's already on order . " Diamond pretended it was n't the happiest day of his life . " Come on , " he said , " let 's take a sannawitch. "  |p197MONDAY  NIGHT , FEBRUARY 4 , 1974-APOSTLE ISLANDSWhen Frank Mayo left the hospital wing Pa told Eve to rush the tape to Cerutti . He lit a cigar , chewing on it as if it were a steak , then climbed down from the high hospital bed like a mauve spider in pajamas . He jammed his feet into a pair of baby-blue quilted mukluks , shucked on a woolen robe and walked Nick into the large corner living room with its magnificent view of beautiful Queens . " Siddown , kiddo , " he said . Nick chose a stern , upright chair . Pa sank into the cushions of the sofa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " At what , Pa ? " " As an investigator . " " I would have done better as a designer of hot cross buns , " Nick said . " Do n't underestimate yourself . We 're getting close here . What we have to do now is to trace back to show who hired Diamond through the Tubesters Union . " " How do we do that ? " " While we sleep , I got guys working on this thing . You 're going to the Apostle Islands , on the short Wisconsin side of Lake Superior . That 's Cerutti country . " " An Indian tribe ? " " What do you mean ? " " Oh . You meant Professor Jim Cerutti . The man who thinks for computers . " " You think you 're kidding , but I can prove that Cerutti thinks better than computers , and he 's been analyzing our problem here on a very intensive basis . I talked to him early this morning . He says he 's ready to make the connection with whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit man to kill Tim . " " What else has Cerutti been thinking about ? I 'd like to have an opinion on Chantal Lamers and why she faked the National Magazine and why she went to such useless lengths to set that comic meeting in a Cadillac in Cleveland . Obviously an operationthat elaborate could n't have seemed useless when it was planned ,  |p198so  the normal thing would be to question why it was planned . " " I 'll put him on it . You never saw anything like this guy , no kidding . But I think I ought to warn you . He has his peculiarities . Anybody who lives alone that much has to be some kind of an oddball . He just happens to be an egomaniac . " " Who is n't , Pa ? " " No , no  --  I mean Cerutti thinks he knows better than anybody else . He actually feels contempt for everybody else . You wo n't believe this  --  but he even patronizes me . " " Pa , why do you think Chantal Lamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she set it up . If she was n't just one of the three employees on the deal . " Pa sighed . Maybe it depressed him . What he said then confirmed this . " I think her orders were to set you up to be killed . " " How ? " " I do n't know . But somewhere along the line during the time you were with her it figures that she was delivering you to a convenient place for killers to operate . Maybe it was set for the magazine building . Maybe she was the killer and she lost her nerve . It 's also logical that it was supposed to happen in Cleveland but that they spotted my men who were waiting to pick Mentor up . " That 's the only theory so far that makes any sense , " Nick said . The feeder airline put Nick down at Ashland on Chequamegon Bay in Wisconsin . Standing on the pier and taking the wet wind off Lake Superior , Nick thought it was colder than Niflheim , the ancient Germanic underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it seemed as though hundreds of long steel pins were being driven deeply into the stiff mask of his face and into all the joints of his body . At 22:05 hours he was taken aboard the Wendebo , Cerutti 's sixty-eight-foot ice cutter , which was on its outside a copy of a Newfoundland Banks fishing vessel . Below decks the Wendebo was beautifully fitted with a compan/ionway ladder that was really a wondrously graceful circular staircase , turning ninety degrees , with a gleaming chrome balustrade leading to a stainless-steel galley . It was warm . He began to thaw . After they were under weigh he discovered that the chart-table hinge could open to a small electric organ . He began to feel much better about everything . There was a wide-open expanse of the combination dining saloon , main cabin , galley and chart room which created exuberant spaciousness , all of it contained in Africanmahogany rubbed to a satin finish and splined with holly . The steward kept putting bacon-and-cheese hors d'oeuvres into a microwave oven . Nick kept eating them and drinking some lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wine bottle was empty . They were running steadily across the international inland sea . Night and the cold were locked out . Nick felt so good he opened the chart table and sat at the organ playing dignified and contrasting pairs of ricercari and capriccios , then moved into the glorious contrapuntals of Franck 's Trois Chorales , building with thickening dimensions into the choral chaconne of Jesu der Meine Seele by J. S. Bach , cantor of Leipzig . It gave him a more stable perspective . It lifted him into the deity position , reassuring him that he would overcome . Music was the master illusionist . The music had created a standoff . The Wendebo took fifty-eight minutes to deliver them to the Cerutti mooring on Schrader Island . The captain told him to follow the lighted posts up along the concrete walk between the snow banks to a low , immensely square building that had a large main house behind it . The low house in the foreground was brilliantly lighted on the outside , but it had no windows . The front door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about the size of a high school gymnasium and seemed to be filled with orderly rows of filing cabinets ; hundreds and hundreds of them . A round-bellied shortish man wearing rimless eyeglasses arose from behind a large desk at a corner of the room and walked toward Nick sniiling . " Welcome , Mr. Thirkicld , " the man said " I am Professor Cerutti " He shook Nick'sp200hand , then locked the only door . He led Nick forward into the great barracks of facts under a thirty-foot ceiling . They were enclosed in a cool , soothing blue shell like the womb of Bessie Smith , but the piped music , not muted enough , had been written by a computer and was as far out as Alpha Centauri . Thousands of reference books formed lazy Vs at each corner of the room , shelf upon shelf from floor to ceiling , all bound in bright yellow as a symbol that Pa 's gold had raised high the roof beams . Nick and Cerutti walked slowly around the perimeter of the room , and the view dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinets blocked all else . " This is Corner One , the writing corner , " Cerutti said as they came to the enormous Florentine desk . Beside the desk were a powder-blue IBM self-correcting typewriter , a dictating machine , a microfilm reader and a tabletop Xerox . " I write all your father 's scenarios for all his problematic and suppositional needs at that desk , " the professor said . They turned to the left and advanced toward Corner Two while Cerutti explained the population of filing cabinets . " These files hold the fruits of my mission as given me by your father , " he said . " They represent about twenty-two years of investigations and interpretationsof personal and business motivations in the lives of all industrial and political managers at the crucial decision level with whom your father has done business , is doing business or plans to do business . This room is , of course , the very heart of the IndustrialMaintenance Services Corporation and , if I may say it , the secret of your father 's prodigious success . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep files as nearly complete as these . The files exceed in total security information the combinedrecorded security effort of Scandinavia plus Benelux and are the equal of the files held by the Republican Party . On your left , ahead , is my communications corner , which we call Corner Two . " Nick saw a twin of the huge Florentine desk at Corner One . Surrounding the chair behind it were three banked telephone switchboard consoles , each held down by a brilliant spotlight . " These give me direct lines to all of your father 's installations , top201our own offices across the world and to my dear mother 's bedside and golf cart . We chat on these lines , of course , but primarily they are for recording tapes for computer retrieval here , tapes of conversationsyour father or his key agents may have during the course of a twenty-four-hour day . The installation was made by the Army Signal Corps when your brother was President . It representsan annual telephone bill , all in , of about seven hundred thousand dollars a year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars a year . It is a communicationshobby nonetheless . A paying hobby , but still a hobby . Your father 's real income is from the earnings on the capital that Industrial Maintenance Services Corporation had already earned for him  --  plus , it goes without saying , the basic fortune that he built with his own fine mind and his two strong hands . " " They wo n't need to run a benefit for Pa , " Nick said . Behind the ponderous communications desk were two hundred and forty shelves on which rested more than twenty-five hundred yellow-bound volumes . " These are my address books , " Cerutti said . " We maintain an up-to-date record of the home , office , extension and hideout telephones of all managers at optimum and secondary decision levels . Your father does n't like to wait when he places a call . He used to call Charles de Gaulle at his bedside phone late at night until Madame De Gaulle objected . Of course all these numbers are held in the computers , which actually dial the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks for by name , but he is still old-fashioned enough to love the idea of his little yellow books . " They reached the far end of the room . " In the far corner on the other side of this room , facing us , which we call Corner Three , you can see my photo desk . In our files here we have stored well over five hundred thousand photographs of people in various kinds of compromised positions , and key specialist photographers everywhere are getting new material for us all the time . On theother hand , iii a more exalted sense , we have millions of photo/graphs of computer-retrievable photos of our planet  --  that is , the planet from the viewpoint of its total physical resources , its points of greatest productivity and richest pollution , and of its least exploited riches . Photography is a very useful discipline . " They came to two facing Edwardian sofas on a Persian carpet in the corridor area between the two working corners . A long , low table separated the two men as they sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satellite in orbit , which photographs the earth 's physical data from five hundred and seventy miles out in space . I do n't know four other individuals who have taken that trouble to secure their own investments in this way . Our ERTS photographs the entire planet , except for the cones around the poles , every eighteen days . We have our specialiststo read the photographs for population shifts , timber , agriculturaland water availabilities , and to pinpoint the location of oil deposits and other high-grade mineral ore . An ERTS is a tool , after all . What wine will you have , Mr. Thirkield ? " " Australian wine ? " Nick asked with bland malice in the hope of erecting one small dam across this flow of warm smarm . " Houghton 's white burgundy ? From western Australia ? Chilled ? About four years old ? " " Anything at all , Cerutti said indifferently . He punched at the console on the tabletop , then leaned back , hardly able to conceal his gratification at having thwarted this young man 's ploy so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditionally from the Lugano area in the Ticino , then after that from Alexandria , Virginia , historic home of John Dean , I am a tea drinker . Tea is such a reassuring continuity in that it was discovered in 2737 B . C.drink a blend of twenty-seven teas  --  fermented , semifermented and unfermented  --  using black Chinese teas , Panyong and Ichang , as the main base . " The lift top at the center of the table opened and the refreshments ascended . Since Nick 's own dossier had indicated that he preferred to drink Australian white wine , the correct wine was on the tray.  | " This is all too leisurely for me , Professor Cerutti , if you do n't mind . I am too pressed to want to hear about tea and satellites . " " Right on , " Cerutti said . " You want to know who persuaded the Tubesters to use its  --  uh  --  expertise to find them Joe Dia-mond . " Nick stared at him . " There are just a few things to clear up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Such as , I think you should know that it was n't by chance that Miles Gander happened to call on InspectorHeller to accompany you to find that rifle . And , incidentally , perhaps your father has n't had the chance to tell you that we picked up the rifle at Heller 's house the morning after the night he died . I deduced that was where the rifle must be . " Nick felt all systems stop . He felt as if someone had just slammed on his hydraulic brakes . " The next morning , " he said slowly . " You had the rifle picked up by a man wearing a police uniform , calling himself Marek , the next morning after Heller died ? " " Yes . " Everything Cerutti had shown him  --  the dazing files , the dazzlingequipment , the paralyzing ( to the imagination ) reach that Pa had developed toward the end of knowing anything he wanted to know  --  began to purple the edges of Nick 's comprehension , began to back him slowly and inexorably toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I told my father more than twenty-four hours after that time that I had deduced where the rifle must be  --  in the very same place  --  and Pa arranged for me to ride out to it with the police commissioner of Philadelphia to retrieve that rifle . Why would he let me think that we were on a fresh trail when he had already overtaken the rifle ? " " Ah , " Cerutti said , " there is a slight difference . I  --  not your father  --  had overtaken the rifle . And it is entirely possible that Ihad not yet reported to your father that we had the rifle . "  | " But how could you know how to look , where to look ? I had n't told my father that Heller existed until the very night Heller died . " Cerutti smiled with Olympian superiority . " My dear fellow , " he said , " Heller was one of the principals in the Philadelphia police department at the time of your brother 's assassination . We have held an open file on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his habits that we did not know , and in his case it was remarkably simple , as you demonstrated , to deduce that he would use the rifle to get money and that he would take the rifle to his house . " " Professor  --  about Miles Gander  --  " " Gander faced bankruptcy . Someone whose identity we do not yet know offered him financial assurances that his bankruptcy could be averted if he cooperated on this matter of the rifle . They promised him the moon because they planned to kill him any-way . " " But , Professor Cerutti , how , in the very short time between my London manager 's telephone call to Miles Gander for a breakfastappointment with me  --  to discuss a matter about which Miles was unaware  --  and our meeting , did these plotters reach Miles to bribe him ? Also , since they seem to have planned on killing Heller anyway , how come they did n't take the rifle from him as soon as he got it ? We deduced what he did with it , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good little detective , " Cerutti said with a patronizing smile . " Never mind this insolent superior comment , " Nick said . " From the icy cores of your gigantic brain please tell me what could have happened . " " From the icy cores of my gigantic brain I will tell you that the answer is : Somewhere along the way you fucked up , and the killers got the information they needed before you ever left Asia . " " How ? " Cerutti stared at him with dislike . " I have no idea where youp205fucked up , Mr. Thirkield . I , personally , never fuck up . But I expected you to , of course . Indeed . Shall we return to the information have been told to convey to you ? " " Please do , " Nick said . He had to talk this over with Keifetz . He might have had the answer all along . He might have it inside himself right now , but he had to talk it out of himself with Keifetz . Professor Cerutti picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just as Miles Gander was a straw man , just as Chantal Lamers and Irving Mentor were frauds , there is another even more sinister misrepresentation that stares at us most balefullyhere . " " If Chantal Lamers was a fraud , who was she ? " " If you would rather talk about a plain and obvious red herring like Lamers , that is all right with me , Mr. Thirkield , but we have come to a fact that is  --  as I implied  --  incontrovertibly sinister . " " Which fact ? " " Frank Mayo lied to you and your father with his story about Diamond being recruited by the Tubesters Union . Diamond was never near the union movement . Diamond never met Vonnie Blanik in his life . Nothing Frank Mayo told you and your father ever happened . " Nick felt like a sliding mote within a kaleidoscope aboard a spinning spacecraft above a turning constellation within a limitlessuniverse . " If Mayo was lying , " he articulated slowly , " then who did find Joe Diamond for the man who bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . Confusion hit Nick like a stomach cramp . Then he stood outside himself : he saw a Nicholas Thirkield sinking into a bog , too hopeless ever to be able to put the whole thing together . " Nineteen years ago Frank Mayo was the usual run of successfulAmerican big crime executive . He probably would have gone on to lead one of their corporate units called a " family , " but nineteen years ; ago , iii 1955 , there was a dramatic change inMayo 's position , his power and his fortune . 1 ssentially , you **26;1119;TOOLONG had you to say to each other , after all , once the indispensable topic of weather  --  very seasonable , very unseasonable  --  hadbeen disposed of ? If it was through Claire that you met Mrs. Fennelly , the auspices would be still less favorable ; the pretty daughter would encourage you to believe , quite wrongly , that her mother was not merely old but senile . " Poor lamb ! " Claire would say , leading you into the celebrated lemon-yellow , silk-walled dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see what comes of being treated like a member of the family ? I 've put you on Mother 's left , but it wo n't be too bad  --  General Dodd , who adores Mother and is exactly her age , is on her right , and they 'll be nattering away at each other from start to finish . Moreover , I 've taken care to put the latest in blond bombshells on your other side . Such breasts , and they say she screws like a rabbit . " It will serve as a footnote to " rabbit " to mention that Claire was in the habit of describing all women under the age of thirty as bombshells and of endowing them with appetites as unappeasable as she liked you to assume hers were . In fact , her appetites were not all that urgent . Once you became her lover , it was startling to discover how easily she could be satisfied , with the supposed fierceness of her lust deteriorating , from one moment to the next , into girlish gratitude , complete even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among others , few people ever slept with Claire for long . Her bitchy conversation contained more ardor than her slender , honey-colored candy bar of a body , and the best of her love-making might well consist , for you , of the provocativeness with which , on her first date with you , she lured you on and then refused you . She played to perfection the role of the lascivious puritan tease ; the rolep29of a pleasing pagan bed-companion appeared to be beyond her . Or so the common gossip went , and Claire was not above vouching for its truth . " I keep being told I 'm absolutelyrotten in bed , " she would say , in her lovely voice . " I blame it on my terrible upbringing . The simplest things are coming to me last . " As for Mrs. Fennelly 's mind in age , it was far from approaching dotage . Her responses in conversation were acute and fearless , and in the course of her incessant joustingswith Claire and Nicky she gave as good as she got . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter and grandson of so many more years in which to have mastered the ruthless tactics of the only child . She had been trained in a hard school , which is to say in no school at all . In the South , in the late nineties , Lily Larkin 's adoring parents were quick to perceive that the quality of education available in the usual public and private schools could only harm their exquisite child ; they chose to educate her at home , with the help of a succession of governesses and tutors  --  Fraulein this and Mademoiselle that , to teach her German and French ( not to mention such skills as sewing a fine seam and painting admirable forget-me-nots upon porcelain ) , and an occasional itinerant professor soand-so , to provide her with a smattering of history , mathematics , and philosophy . Lily never passed an hour in a classroom or schoolyard , never acquired a chum , never knew what it was to walk home from school through the autumn twilight , kicking at fallen leaves and holding hands with the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been a lonely little girl , but looking back upon those years Mrs. Fennelly would say that she remembered not a single unhappy moment . " My blessed mummy and daddyp30thought only of my good , " she said . " I was raised in a house of love . " " You make it sound , dear Mother of mine , " Claire said , " as if you had been born in a brothel . " When Mrs. Fennelly lost her temper , she took care to lower her voice . She said , " Your remarks are often less amusing than you suppose . If you were capable of being a fiftieth as devoted to Nicky as my parents were to me , Nicky would be a very happy child . And we know , do we not , that he is not a very happy child ? And we know why ? " So little had Mrs. Fennelly missed , in youth , the roughand-tumbleof school life that she attempted to provide Claire with an upbringing identical to her own . But times had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up their lives to little charges in great houses , and in the end Mrs. Fennelly decided to take Claire abroad . In Europe they would be able to locate suitable instructors on , so to speak , their home grounds , in settings that would be an education in themselves . Mrs. Fennelly was , besides , newly widowed , and Europe was the conventional solace of widows of wealth and breeding . There was another advantage to going to Europe , not to be spoken of before Claire . The late Mr. Fennelly was about to be the center of a scandal , and the farther away Mrs. Fennelly and Claire were when the scandal broke , the better . More than most widows , Mrs. Fennelly was eager to obliterate every memory of her husband . She had not much liked him in life , and she had found reason to dislike him intensely in death . Having no means of his own , the self-important little man had appeared content to live on an allowance granted him by Mrs. Fennelly from the ever/increasing resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His heart and as much of his purse as he could manage had been elsewhere . For the payment of household expenses , the Fennellys had long made use of a joint checking account , and it turned out , upon Mr. Fennelly 's unexpected death ( he was stung by a bee , and the sting so frightened him that he suffered an immediate , fatal heart attack , keeling over without a word into a nearby rosebush ) , that he had been transferring thousands of dollars a year out of their joint account and into an account unknown to Mrs. Fennelly . It was an account that he had opened in the name of his mistress , also unknown to Mrs. Fennelly . When the family lawyers broke the news to Mrs. Fennelly that her late husband was not merely a thief but a philanderer , she was quick to act . She had his body exhumed from the Larkin family plot and placed in a plot at the farthest possible distance from it , in a section of the cemetery filled with nondescript newcomers ; she then ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mistress . She swept Claire off to Paris , and when , from time to time , the child had occasion to speak of her father , Mrs. Fennelly would purse her lips and say , " That is a closed story . " She was glad that she had trusted her feelings and behaved harshly toward the mistress . She believed in punishment , for herself and everyone . The only time her blessed daddy had ever whipped her , for some tiny transgression , she had felt an overwhelming gratitude to him . Afterward , how they had hugged each other ! Mrs. Fennelly and Claire spent several years abroad . Claire learned bits and pieces of four or five languages , speaking them mostly in the infinitive tense ; she learned to cook a variety of national dishes , which soon converged intop32a single careless international approximation of shepherd 's pie ; and she learned exceptionally good manners . Unlike her mother , she collected plenty of chums , for the Fennellys moved from hotel to hotel in season , and hotels offer even greater opportunities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Claire had crushes on scores of girls , met in summer in the windy belly of some huge beached monster of a seaside hotel , or in winter by an open fire in the lobby of a dark Alpine inn . She would flirt with these gawky transient girls , using only her marvelousgreen eyes to make them want to touch her and be touched by her . The most satisfactory adventure was to bring them to the point of seduction without a word having been spoken ; that way , one remained in jeopardy of rebuff up to the last possible moment . Claire liked , above all , to take chances ; the greater the risk of failure , the more exhilarating one 's success . The conquest of older girls was obviously more thrilling than the conquest of younger ones ; it was , perhaps , in the course of making love to older girls that she acquired the habit of saying " Thank you " in that breathless , babyish voice . In her late teens , with reluctance , she began to save more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricked her into that unwelcome deprivation , by threats that she later discovered to be without substance . They were importunate lovers , greedy for their own good ; what they wished to secure was immediate and uninterrupted possession of her . If only they had been content to have her without trafficking in her ignorance ! Men , they said ( speaking as if not for themselves , and yet claiming to speak for all men ) , would find her undesirable if it became known that she slept with women . For a time , she dared not disbelieve them , but soonp33enough she learned that the facts were otherwise : without exception , her sleeping with women excited men . Indeed , it often turned them into better lovers than they had hitherto known how to be ; some silly schoolboy notion of the forbiddenbecame their infallible aphrodisiac . Women lovers needed no hint of something illicit to arouse them ; they sought from Claire what every lover seeks from another  --  to be the best beloved  --  and the sex of their rivals was a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lied to her at that critical moment in her life , and it may have been in part to avenge herself upon them that she would appear so ardent in the opening stages of a courtship and then prove so passive in the deed . When she boasted of being rotten in bed , it was men she was thinking of having disappointed and not women . Nicky Gault , the third only child in the family , may well have wished to imitate his grandmother and mother in escaping school , but he was born too late . If times had changed between Mrs. Fennelly 's generation and Claire 's , they had changed even more between Claire 's and Nicky 's . It was no longer imaginable that a child should be educated at home ; still more unimaginable if the child was a boy . Men had careers to achieve , and , in the Fennelly-Gault world of gentlemanly making good , a career began , not with the last school that one attended , but with the first . At six , Nicky entered Hubbard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . The school occupied a hideous yellow-brick building in the East Sixties , with a cagelike exercise yard on the roof and a smell of disinfectantin the tiled corridors that would always make Nicky feel slightly sick to his stomach . He was a good-lookingp34little boy , very thin , with his father 's large nearsighted dark eyes and dark hair and his mother 's honey coloring . His grandmother feared that Nicky 's slightness prefigured an eventual lack of height  --  how irritating it would be if that long-dead popinjay of a Fennelly grandfather had managed to impose his diminutive body on a grandson he had never seen ! Though Nicky gave the impression of being highly intelligent , in his first tests he scored so badly that Mr. Phimister , headmaster of Hubbard , felt obliged to summon Claire to a grim early-morning discussion of the problem . From behind the usual clouds of pedagogical pipe smoke , he warned her that if Nicky were to prove incapableof measuring up to the high Hubbard standard , the just and merciful thing would be to remove him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would describe as a borderline case , " Phimister said , with the air of a man who has given considerable thought to the inventionof the word " borderline . " " But he 's only six ! " Claire cried , in her most enchanting voice . She had made up so prettily  --  and at such an hour  --  in order to please Phimister . She smiled radiantly at him , thinking , Ah , what a miserable , sexless little shit you are . Phimister said , " Here at Hubbard we do n't think of six as all that young . We might have hoped to do a better job with Nicky if "  --  Phimister worked his hands , kneading an imaginary ball  --  " we 'd had the shaping of the lad at four . " As things turned out , Nicky did well enough at Hubbard to be kept on , though he was never to do as well as was expectedof him . From the start he was oppressed by a sense of being considered a failure even when , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a success : he got adequate grades , he played games wellp35enough to get by without being scorned , he wrote an occasionalarticle , no lumpier than those by his fellows , for the weekly school newspaper . He was a dutiful child but not a happy one . He wore a continuous , wary smile , listening to other boys ' jokes with patience , and volunteering none of his own . On every term report , one or another of his teachers was sure to write " Always well prepared but seems unwilling to participate in impromptu discussions . " Once or twice a year , the school psychiatrist would call him in for a chat . " Something of a loner , are n't you , Gault ? " he would ask , giving the little boy  --  at eight , at ten !  --  the dignity of a manly last name . " Sir ? " " Do n't mix much with the other boys  --  that sort of thing ? " " Oh , I do n't know , sir . " " Weekends , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to yours ? " " Weekends , one day I go with my father and the other with Mother . Sometimes Dad takes a friend and me to a ball game . " A fresh tack , hoping to catch the boy off guard : " I hear you like snakes . " " Yes , sir , very much . " " You keep some as pets at home ? " " Not as pets , sir . " " Aha . I stand corrected . The scientific view . What do you feed them on ? " " Mice , sir . " " You raise mice , too ? " " Yes , sir . " " And what do you feed the mice on ? " " I try to give them a balanced diet . "  | " Healthy mice make healthy snakes , is that it ? Ha , ha ! " The boy stared . The psychiatrist scribbled a note to himself : " Mutilated sense of humor . Perhaps a hint of latent autism here ? " " How does your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't mind . " " Sensible mother . " " Yes , sir . Is that all , sir ? " " Dear me , Gault , have I been keeping you from some more important engagement ? " The psychiatrist gave a hearty laugh , but the most that the boy could provide in response was a wan smile . Rigid . Holding everything in . Oh , that damnable infantile anal retentiveness ! How common it was among the rich ! " Yes , yes , Gault , that 'll be all for now . " Scribble , scribble , scribble . " Have a good day ! " During Nicky 's years at Hubbard , the family situation remained astonishingly stable : nobody was being born or dying , nobody was becoming very rich or very poor . Time passed with only the rudimentary punctuation of birthdays and holidays , and so seemed scarcely to pass at all . Mrs. Fennelly was entering her seventies  --  an age after which , for women , there is little medical or other reason that they should ever die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkin place in western North Carolina , surrounded by servants as old and liverish as herself , whom she bullied and who were quick to return her unkindnesses blow for blow . Having been divorced from Nicholas Gault the autumn that Nicky entered Hubbard , Claire bought the old Harlow house on Gramercy Park and spent several years contentedly reconstructing the interior and furnishing it with what she called " amusing bits , " meaning the choicest of English and Irish eighteenth-century porters ' chairs , huntp37tables , partners ' desks , and Chippendale wine coolers and knife boxes . Old silver , china , and pewter flowed in a glintingstream into Gramercy Park from London , Dublin , and Madison Avenue . Claire enjoyed living alone with Nicky in their huge , echoing doll 's house , full of such charming toys . She liked being divorced and answerable to no one  --  liked it so much , indeed , that she came to like Nicholas Gault as well , thinking of him as the instrument of her freedombecause he had consented to give her a divorce and forgetting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . But , as to that , she believed the failure of the marriage to have been entirely her fault . She had married Nicholas in part because he had curly hair and skin that tasted like Necco wafers , and in part because he had so much wanted her to do so . He had been like a child in the touching pertinacity of his pleading . She ought not to have given in to him  --  to one as ready to experimentas she had always been , what could be so novel and compelling about the taste of Necco wafers ? About simple begging ? Especially since she was no longer a schoolgirl , no longer even a very young woman . She was thirty-one , and she had never been married . Well , and so there it was : that was , of course , the chief reason that she had married him . She had wanted the experience not so much of being married as of having been married . It was a relationship that she felt an intense curiosity about and not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marriage vows as she repeated them , they might have been in Choctaw . Thus it befell that Gault , believing himself to be the beneficiary of her kindness , became her victim . Four years later , she had Nicky , and again it was a question less of wanting a child than of wanting the sensation ofp38having had a child . It was motherhood that she was determined to take the measure of before it was too late , as once she had been determined to take the measure of marriage . The defect of motherhood was that its consequences remainedadamantly present , requiring to be dealt with , while marriage was but a piece of paper , canceled by a second piece of paper . She had been hard on Gault and she was often hard on Nicky ; it took her a long time to forgive him for surviving the experiment in which he had played a leading role . The years in Gramercy Park were the most tranquil of her life . She indulged herself to the full , aware that in doing so she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , conventionally nice . She stared at her image in the great gilt mirror above the drawing-room mantel . In the depths of the intricately carved frame of the mirror , elderly mandarins holding parasols sauntered through latticedpavilions , dreaming that they were butterflies . The mantel and mirror  --  all that survived of a red-brick Georgianhouse in the ferny depths of Sussex  --  had come up at auction in London , and Claire had outbid the richest shipping magnate in the world in order to make them hers . The gilded mandarins were her household gods . Merely to look at them made her feel as if something pleasing and entirely unexpected was just about to happen . Behind Claire 's reflection in the dusk of the two-hundred-year-old glass lay reflected the drawing-room windows , and through the windows , still more duskily , could be glimpsed the reflected park , with its high black iron palings and green parterre . Claire bowed to her image among the mandarins , and said , " Well ! So I am quite a nice person , after all ! " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this high opinion of herself.  |p39Every  summer , the three of them would travel abroad . Tirelessly , the ill-assorted little band rummaged about in the attic of Europe , seeking the ideal place in which to spend a holiday . There was certainly no chance that they would find it . Being so different in age and temperament and being , moreover , so eager to quarrel over any topic that came to hand , how likely was it that they would ever be willing to share a common opinion of a house , a town , a district , a country ? That would be , for them , like playing tennis with the net down . Their purpose was not to find the ideal place to visit , but to dispose , one by one , of the ideal places suggested by others . Much of the relish that Mrs. Fennelly took in travel consisted of ridiculing what her friends had found reason to praise ; for her part , Claire would side with the friends against her mother , while Nicky would weigh the advantages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother , now with his mother . It made an exhilarating game , in which sooner or later blood was sure to be drawn . They traveled in style . On the earliest of their summer excursions , Mrs. Fennelly would have her Rolls shipped to some port convenient to their eventual destination , but as the number of ships crossing the Atlantic declined , it occurredto her that it would be wise to maintain two Rollses  --  one for use in the States , the other for use abroad . Bailey , her chauffeur , was shipped back and forth by air . A sullen , elderly black man , Bailey was indispensable to Mrs. Fennelly ; she treated him like a slave and he responded like a slave , storing up his resentment of her possession of him to spend upon others . Summer after summer , Bailey managed to conduct the little party safely across Europe , speaking no language except English , and of English only a handful ofp40curt words of abuse . In his hotel room at night , he would master the portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . Once under way , he would stop at intervals to check the route with passers-by . He would indicate with a finger on the map some sought-for village or town , and all he wished in reply was the passerby'sfinger pointing in the correct direction . If , out of kindness , the passer-by attempted to add a few helpful words , Bailey would make a fist in his face . " No goddam foreigner goin ' to give me shit ! " he would say , and stalk back to the Rolls . Sometimes the passer-by would have an understandingof English and sometimes not ; in any event , the sudden violence of the old man would sink uneasily into memory as something that might not actually have happened ; perhaps the angry figure , so black inside his black uniform , had been only an apparition , created by some trick of summer heat and shimmering sunlight . " What on earth did that rude man say to you ? " Mrs. Fennelly would ask when Bailey got back in the car . " Do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say . " Veezelee , here we come ! " Fennelly , Gault &; Son spent one of their summers in a high-roofed , ochre-colored villa on the Brenta Canal , a few miles from Venice . The exterior of the house had changed little since Palladio had designed it for a wealthy merchant family , some four hundred years earlier . A few bathrooms had been tucked here and there in the walls  --  when a toilet was flushed , pipes shuddered and snapped all over the house  --  and the lofty interiors were illuminated at night by dim , unshaded electric-light bulbs , which dangled at the ends of long cords in odd corners of the rooms , not because they were useful there , but because the ceiling had provedp41easy to penetrate at those points . The canal in front of the house had also scarcely changed in the course of time . It had been known to stink in the sixteenth century , and it certainly stank in the twentieth , when Mrs. Fennelly , Claire , and Nicky made their way down the steps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years earlier , out of an abandoned landing stage . In Palladio 's day , the canal had been full of flotsam that , being mostly of wood , soon rotted away and sank from sight . The flotsam that Mrs. Fennelly and her family observed was made of plastic and remained immortally buoyant ; syringes , fragments of kitchen utensils , and chubby dolls ' arms and legs bobbed in the rushes along the banks of the canal . Handkerchiefs pressed to their noses , the family agreed that it would not be wise to risk eating out of doors . Instead , they took their meals in a clammy basement dining room , with serpents of punk burning in saucers along the floor to keep at bay mosquitoes so big that by candlelight they cast shadows like miniature aircraft up and down the table . The villa on the Brenta was not a success . Mrs. Fennelly was unable to imagine what her friends the Hetheringtons had seen in the place , renting it year after year . Claire admitted that the house was inconvenient , the staff unmanageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffocating , but she liked the sense of being a part of ancient , prodigal , sensuous Venice . " I am a red-haired courtesan , " she said . " I have a lovely big bosom out of Veronese . A dozen swarthy lovers wait to leap into my bed and suck my nipples . I sell my favors to the highest bidder . " " No doubt you would have enjoyed a great success , " her mother said . " Your gifts lie in a different direction from mine . "  |p42A  disappointment equal to that of the Palladian villa confrontedthem one summer in Norway , where , in the mountainssome two hours ' drive from Oslo , they rented an estate that had been laid out to resemble an eighteenthcenturyvillage . A dozen or so log farmhouses and barns had been plucked from sites farther up in the mountains and scattered as if at random on a grassy hillside looking out over a lake as blue as Como . The owner of the estate , a rich American of Norwegian descent , had taken care to equip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could be very snug under those quaint sod roofs , one could sweat in luxury in the ancient , electrified sauna . The estate had at least one advantage over the villa on the Brenta ; there were no mosquitoes , perhaps because the temperature remainedat an arctic level throughout their stay . There were also no neighbors , and this was not an advantage . Except for the servants on the property , it appeared that the entire district was without human life  --  indeed , without life of any kind . From the pretty flowered terrace , nothing could be seen to move anywhere in the vast prospect of fields and birchwood and sky . No sailboat ever broke the smooth surface of the lake ; its waters were so icy that anyone falling into them would survive for fifteen minutes at most . Goats and cows roamed at will somewhere on the mountains that rose behind the estate , but even they could not be seen and patted into neighborly tameness ; the constant far-off tinny clanking of bells heightened the lonely look of the nearby empty pastures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves . Claire gave them instructions with the help of an English-Norwegian dictionary ; they were eager to please , but she understood not a word they said to her in their harsh seesaw tongue . Bailey sat among them at night ,  |p43drinking  aquavit and abusing them with sour gusto . He would roar at them that they were a bunch of goddam lowlifeblond blue-eyed bastards , and they would smile and fill his glass . He was the first black they had ever seen , and they found him charming . Mrs. Fennelly recalled that the people who had recommendedthe estate had described it with rapture as " unspoiled . " Glaring down the hillside toward the exquisite , unusable lake , Mrs. Fennelly said , " A place that has nothing in it capable of being spoiled is not entitled to be called unspoiled . It is time we made other plans . " She and Claire quarreled over which of them had first proposed renting the estate ; Nicky sided with Claire in putting the blame on Mrs. Fennelly , who retired to her bedroom in tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bake as she idly made love to it . Nicky was of an age to be engaged in sexual adventures of his own ; no doubt the sauna served him as it did her , as a secret , makeshift , personal trysting place . The three of them bickered at dinner over where they might go next . Bailey could drive them to the airport at Oslo , then take the Rolls on , by ship , to some handy port in southern Europe . They heard Bailey ranting away drunkenly in the kitchen ; for his sake as well as theirs , they must make good their escape as soon as possible . Claire put in a call to an old lover of hers , who lived on a big farm near Malaga . He had often invited her to come and stay with him en famille . Their affair had taken place many years earlier , and it was rare for them nowadays to make love ; it would certainly be no hardship to them to be merely devoted friends for as long as her mother and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mingle her sex life and her family life , especially during the weeks of the long summer holiday . She had tried that ex/periment once or twice in the past , with unlucky results . Claire 's old lover was delighted to hear from her . They must come to Malaga at once . The house was full of delightful people . There was a cottage on the grounds that would be exactly right for them . There was even a cottage for Bailey and a shed for the Rolls . How old was the boy by now ? Thirteen ? He would enjoy the tennis court , the Ping-Pong tables , the swimming pool . There were bridge players and backgammon players for her mother  --  she was please to give his affectionate regards to the old bitch . As for Claire , he would make love to her all night . No ? Not the way it was going to be this time ? Very well , he would keep on the girl with whom he had been consoling himself all summer . She could neither read nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could do so  --  but she had an incomparable body . Every inch of it was covered with almost invisible golden down , which here and there became fleece . Delectable . Claire would have to see for herself . He would expect them within twenty-four hours . Off they went , joyously squabbling , their threatened summerrestored to promise . Mrs. Fennelly at eighty , though to the casual eye she might look as well as ever , saw signs that age was nicking away at her . She felt changes of temperature more than she used to , and would carry a shawl with her even in the hottest weather . She had no use for the findings of medical science and all the fiddle-faddle of statistics  --  she knew for a certainty that drafts and wet feet gave her colds . For that reason , and therefore not alone because she enjoyed disagreeingwith Claire , she expressed grave doubts about an adventure that Claire was eager to have them undertake.  |p45From  some new acquaintance at a dinner party , Claire had got wind of a marvelous old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong enthusiasm , she was bound that Mrs. Fennelly , Nicky , and she should spend a month 's holiday there . In a querulous voice , Mrs. Fennelly wanted to know if it was n't the case that it did nothing but rain in Ireland . She would come down with rheumatism , sure as fate ; it was in the family . " Mother , what nonsense ! There 's lovely sun . " As to the prevalence of rain or sun in Ireland , Claire knew no more than her mother . But their ignorance was a point in favor of the adventure ; Ireland was one of the few countries left in Europe that neither Claire nor her mother had ever visited . It was time that they got it under their belts . People were constantly raving about how pretty and little visited it was , especially in the West Country ; this was Mrs. Fennelly 's golden opportunity to discover that people were wrong and tell them so . Moreover , Nicky at fifteen had added to his passion for snakes a passion for horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no snakes in Ireland , but there were certainly tens of thousands of horses . Where could one hope to ride better ? If the boy behaved well , perhaps Claire might buy him a hunter there . Ireland had still another claim upon them . For the first time in all their holidays , this summer Nicky was to be supplied with a companion , and the companion 's preferences would have to be taken into consideration . The companion had been selected at the request  --  indeed , at the express command  --  of tiresome little Mr. Phimister and his no less tiresome colleague , the school psychiatrist . According to them , Nicky 's tendency to be a loner had increased to an alarming degree . Unless the tendency was checked andp46reversed , the consequences might well be dire . Nicky must be brought out of himself at all costs , and this was unlikely to happen as long as he was obliged to spend another summerin the company of  --  Mr. Phimister broke off , knocking the dottle from his pipe into the palm of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Phimister would yield to no one in his admiration for her , but she was eighty , was she not ? And Claire herself , again not to put the matter too bluntly , was , was she not . . . ? The dottle was deftly transferred from hand to wastepaper basket . Mr. Phimister put it to Claire that the ideal companion for Nicky would be some extroverted , healthy young athlete , a few years older than Nicky , whom he could look up to and emulate . There were hundreds of such splendid young men studying on scholarships in colleges throughout the country ; they would like nothing better than to spend a holiday in Europe and at the same time pick up a few hundred dollars in much-needed cash . Claire had only to drop a note to the proper party at Harvard , Princeton , or wherever she pleased , and arrange a few interviews . From the point of view of the Hubbard School , it would be helpful if the companion were able to tutor Nicky in geometry and English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgoing , energetic . Claire regarded Mr. Phimister with astonishment . What on earth , she wondered , did that little gray slug know of sunlight , except to scuttle out of it ? Following Mr. Phimister 's instructions , Claire conducted several interviews , one of which proved highly successful . The interview took place in the small study off the drawing room in the house on Gramercy Park . The candidate was a twenty-year-old undergraduate at Yale named John Kelly . What an amusing name , Claire thought  --  it will hold itsp47ground ably enough against Nicky 's formidable Nicholas Van Sinderen Gault IV . He was a sturdy young man , with light-blue eyes , curly black hair , and a snub nose , which even now ( for the season was early spring ) had a surprising patch of sunburn at its very tip . Claire and John Kelly sat alone in the cozy little room , over tea and sandwiches , and of course she could not resist flirting with him . She lay back in depths of flowered chintz , behind the winking tea things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette smoke . Perhaps the smoke would serve to take a few years off her age ; no doubt John thought of her as being a hundred . " You 're never called Jack ? " " No , ma'am . " " You must surely be Irish , with that coloring ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Lots of brothers and sisters ? " " That , too . " " Where do you come in the family ? " " Three older , three younger . " " Oh , God ! That does n't give you claustrophobia ? " " No , I like it . " " Ever been to Ireland ? " " Never been out of this country . " " Do you think you might find it amusing to spend a month there ? " " Sounds great . " " You might even discover a long-lost Kelly cousin or two , tucked away under a hedge somewhere . " " That 'd be great , too . " Plainly , conversation was not going to prove John 's strong point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most innocent level , an easy conquest , but his credentials in re/spect to geometry , English , and disposition were impeccable . Nicky liked him at once , which is to say that he volunteered afterward that John was O.K. ; it was as much praise as Nicky bestowed on anyone . John and Nicky met in the study , formally shaking hands and staring each other in the eye . As they exchanged the wary monosyllables of the young , it became obvious that they would get on better without the burden of Claire 's presence . She excused herselfand from her bedroom put in a call to her mother in North Carolina . " My dear , our problems are solved . I 've found the most darling boy for Nicky . Very straight arrow and with the nicest blue eyes . And there is only one condition to his coming with us  --  a pleasant condition , almost an omen . He 's Irish , and it turns out that he had already set his heart on catching a glimpse of his ancestral domain this summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Never said a word ! What a suspicious nature you have . " " It will rain every day . " " The sun will shine . John Kelly says so . " " Is that the young man 's name ? You know I do n't like Irish names . " And with reason : the name Fennelly could only be Irish , and one of the many things for which Mrs. Fennelly would never forgive her cockalorum of a husband was his causing her to lose her maiden name , almost as precious to her as her virginity . Lily Larkin was so charming , all honeysuckle and camellias ; Lily Fennelly might have been the daughter of some coarse immigrant family , newly come upon its lace curtains and not yet at ease with them . The European Rolls , having wintered in the south of France , was shipped by sea to Ireland . As for Bailey , he wasp49shipped by air from North Carolina , and when the little party of four arrived at Shannon , there he stood at the airportexit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much to grumble at in Ireland : having to drive on the left-hand side of the road ; having to drive on roads that were far too narrow and abruptly winding for a Rolls ; having to drive among a people who appeared to favor fowl over cattle , cattle over pedestrians , and pedestrians over motorists . He would be able to be in radiant bad temper from morning to night , with the advantage of there being always a pub at hand , with an assured audience of morose and mostly silent listeners . They drove up through mild Clare , sea-green Galway , the heights of Connemara . A mist hung over the stony fields , and the sun seemed always upon the brink of bursting forth , but it never did . Ireland was a tiny country of immense distances ; everything was much farther away than Bailey 's road maps indicated , because of the difficulty of the terrain . From time to time , they stopped by the wayside for a thermos of tea and some Boland biscuits . In the distance , an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke from a turf fire smoldering in some hidden cottage . Mrs. Fennelly held out a hand from under her shawl ; acidly , she affirmed that she felt raindrops . Claire called attention to the fact that her body was casting a shadow on the graveled roadway ; ergo , the sun must be out . Nicky refrainedfrom taking sides in these trifling disputes . They had lost their savor for him , largely because he was so busy imitating John . Meanwhile , Bailey would take advantage of the recess to stalk off into the bracken to relieve himself . With every year , the frequency with which he performed this errand increased and the trouble he took to disguisep50its purpose diminished . More than once , Mrs. Fennelly had to complain that he was not only visible but audible . " Farther , Bailey , farther ! " she would call out to him , in a shrill , birdy voice , and Bailey , legs spread , would roar back with relish over his shoulder , " Too late , ma'am , too late ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny , outgoing , and a coiled spring for energy . He was a natural athlete , unhappy only when he was obliged to sit still . While others rested , he was busy doing knee bends and sit-ups and push-ups . Though he enjoyed all sports , basketball was his favorite . Whenever the family stopped for tea , John jumped from the car and starteditjogging , Nicky at his side . As he jogged , John would dribble an imaginary basketball in front of him or between his legs , then suddenly break away and start shooting hoops in the direction of an adjacent tree  --  swish ! swish !  --  the imaginary ball never so much as touching the rim of the imaginary basket , In a makeshift form of fox-andhounds , John and Nicky would see how far ahead of the Rolls they could run in the course of a tea recess ; their reward would be the astonishment of Bailey and the ladies over the distance they invariably managed to cover . As the boys would come into sight far along the road , Mrs. Fennellywould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Nicky . John is built like a truck , Nicky a watch . The differencecould be very dangerous . " " You and your imagination of disaster ! It never sleeps . " " My father had a very weak heart when he was still only in his twenties . " " Grampa lived to be seventy-four . " " But , then , he always took such wonderful care of him-self. "  |p51Bailey  would stop the car and the boys would tumble joyously aboard . " My dear young heroes , " Claire would say , " you smell like a locker room at Yankee Stadium . " John would look abashed and Nicky proud . Irritated with Claire  --  sweat was not a permissible topic of conversation  --  but seeking to achieve the last word , Mrs. Fennelly would address herself to her grandson : " How your mother can know what such a locker room smells like is her secret . " The demesne of Plumes lay a few miles south of Sligo . It occupied most of a long peninsula that ran far out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with steep , rocky cliffs to the north , where the great storms broke in winter , sending icy sea spray hundreds of yards inland . Between the Gothic cottage that served as a gatehouse on the public highway and the mansion overlooking the sea was a weedy ribbon of drive , perhaps five miles in length . Once , the drive had run pleasantly enough among open fields and meadows , but early in the nineteenth century some hard-pressed ancestral Merriot , hoping to recoup the family fortune , had gambled what little remained of the fortune upon the planting of conifers  --  hundreds of acres of pines and firs , for which , he imagined , his descendants would bless him as they drew a splendid annual income from the wise harvesting of timber . Nothingof the sort had happened , or was likely to happen , and if the ancestor was thought of at all , it was in order that his name be damned , not praised . From one generation of Merriots to the next , the plantations had been savagely ransacked for the payment of damages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been famously litigious ) and were now left to grow untended . Winter gales blew down uncounted thousands of trees , which , labor being un/available to salvage them , were left to rot on the ground ; subsequently , fires would break out in the dead timber and spread into neighboring stands of living trees . The present generation of Merriots had no money with which to put the plantations in order . They could only shake their fists in despair over the wild growth that kept stealthily creeping in upon the main house . By now , even on the brightest days the towering firs cast a darkness downward over the lawn , upward against the sky , filling the air with a palpable green gloom . Claire had taken care to telephone Plumes the day before , announcing their imminent arrival , and Major Merriot had seemed to say most heartily  --  the connection was bad  --  that everything would be in readiness for them . The arrangements for a month 's rental of Plumes had been notably informal , Major Merriot being loath to put anything in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what anyone else had put in writing . Weeks passed before a letter from Claire would receive an answer , and then the answer was likely to be but a word or two scrawled in whatever empty space the Major had managed to find at the bottom of Claire 's letter : " Good . " " Will see to . " " July 10th will be excellent . " As the Rolls made its way through the demesne of Plumes , rocking like a Spanish caravel whenever it struck a rut or bump  --  " Goddam this road , " Bailey exclaimed , " shaking my poor old baby to pieces ! "  --  Mrs. Fennelly observed that the outlook struck her as distinctly Carpathian . " It would come as no surprise to me , " she said , " if Major Merriot should turn out to be a lineal descendant of Count Dracula . " " Ah , Nicky ! John ! " Claire said . " Would n't that be lovely ?  |p53A  vampire instead of a leprechaun ? " It was not much of a joke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for theirs ; she was trying to keep her spirits up . This Irish adventure , if it failed , would be known to have been entirely her fault . The drive ran up a gradual slope between the dark firs and came out upon a paved courtyard directly in front of an immense pile of reddish-gray stone  --  a somber eighteenthcenturymansion , with a lichenous portico and upwards of a hundred small-paned windows placed at regular intervals along its gaunt facade . Seated on the broad front steps , ruffling the neck of an Irish wolfhound , was a slender , middle-aged man in a Norfolk jacket . The jacket was of a color that almost matched the house , and the tweed had plainly been woven for him with that match in mind . The man stood up as the Rolls swung round in front of him , and it had scarcely come to a stop before he opened the rear door , bowed , and said with a smile , " Merriot here . Welcometo Plumes ! " " How kind of you , " said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Major Merriot was a charmer , and she had no intention of being charmed by him . Claire , of course , given her tastes , might be in his bed within a week . " This is my daughter , Mrs. Gault , with whom you have corresponded , " Mrs. Fennelly said . " My grandson , Nicky . Our friend John Kelly . And this is Bailey . " " Good Irish names , " said the Major , unaware that he had struck an ideally unsuitable note . In haste , protectively , Claire said , " What a beautiful place ! " ( Her heart sinking : it was not in the least beautiful . ) " I had no idea of its size . " Merriot spoke in short bursts , not unlike his writing . " Far too big . The staff complains . Not , however , I trust , to you . "  |p54He  gestured vaguely toward the nearby woods . " My wife and I. In a cottage yonder . During the course of your stay . " He drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will be available to help you in any way . " Merriot led the way up the broad steps to the open front door . In front of them glimmered in its own marbly dusk a vast three-story-high hall . On the stone flags of the courtyardbehind them , as Bailey began the familiar task of unloadingthe Rolls , they heard the first patterings of rain . Nothing about Plumes was as Claire had imagined it would be . A sunny Georgian mansion set among smooth green lawns , with a blue sea at the foot of the garden  --  that had been her Plumes , the Plumes she had sketched with delight for her mother and son in the months before their arrival , and the reality was hard to adjust to . The house was a tomb , and not alone because of the hollowness of the family 's footfalls along the paved corridors , or the sound of their voices echoing bleakly in the high-ceilinged rooms ; it was a tomb also in the scantiness of its furnishings . In their daily explorations , they were astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal held a sufficientquantity of beds , chests , chairs , and dressing tables , the remaining twenty-odd bedrooms had long since been stripped to the walls ; tatters of draperies hung at the permanentlyshuttered windows , and the dainty paw marks of innumerable generations of mice were etched in the dust of the bare floors . Of the big downstairs rooms , the drawing room , the dining room , the library , the billiard room , and the so-called morning room were still habitable , as was the shadowy enfilade of kitchen , butler 's pantry , scullery , laundry , and storage rooms that made up the service wing ,  |p55but  the ballroom , which had most of a wing of the house to itself , and a dozen or more other rooms intended for entertainmentwere carpetless , pictureless , and without a stick of furniture  --  grand , desolate chambers , with crystal chandeliersbagged in rotting muslin , waiting in vain in a continuoustwilight throughout the years for doors to be flung open and crowds of merrymakers to come tumbling through . How many years they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could tell with precision . Major Merriot had been selling off family things from the very day that he came into possession of his inheritance at the age of twenty-one , and Horne reckoned that that event had taken place thirtyfouryears and seven months earlier . Horne himself had been among the family things that the Major had inherited , and by now he was much more nearly the archivist and historian of Plumes than a mere keeper of its keys . Horne and Bailey would sit for hours in a grottolike basement room beneath the kitchen , looking out through barred windows onto a sunken areaway high with weeds and mossy refuse . They would face each other at a deal table , with a bottle of whiskeybetween them , and exchange tales of their long lifetimes of enslavement . Horne was happy to say that the Major had been the best of masters , and Bailey was happy to say that Mrs. Fennelly had been the worst of mistresses . Each took pleasure in the other 's unfamiliar mode of viewing things  --  Horne startled Bailey with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , and Bailey startled Horne with his affectation of contempt for the human race in general and for his crosspatch employer in particular . Over the whiskey , they became in a short while fast friends . They were the same age , and they were lonely . By the time a bottle of the Irish was finished of a late summer 's evening ,  |p56they  were , though they did n't know it , as near as might be in each other 's arms . The family 's explorations of the house were a necessity laid upon them by the weather . No outdoor activity was possiblein the days following their arrival at Plumes , for the rain that had begun falling as they entered the house continued to fall without intermission from that moment forward . Its persistence was uncanny . Day after day , they woke to a slur of rain washing , not in rivulets , but in ropes of water down the panes of their bedroom windows . Winds from far out in the Atlantic shook the wet ivy that gripped the house ; from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way down a flue and send smoke curling out into the room , a wraith that smelled of both sea and fire . Mrs. Fennelly and Claire were served breakfast in bed by a stout housemaid named Agnes , distinguished for tiny , red-rimmed eyes and a mountainous disarray of gray , brown , and yellow hair . Nicky and John took breakfast in the dim nave of the dining room , perched on chairswivern-backed , lion-footed  --  worthy in scale of a race of giant kings . Horne encouraged them to consume large quantities of oatmeal , eggs , bacon , coarse brown bread , and milk , on the grounds , repeated every morning , that they were growing boys . ( Orange juice was unknown at Plumes . " There were orange trees in the conservatory when I was a lad , " Horne said . " They were meant to be looked at , not squeezed . " ) Bailey ate his breakfast in the kitchen , within arm 's reach of the immense stove upon which the cook , Mrs. Begley , kept several iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porridge , one for water for tea , and one for soup , which , though its flavor altered but little from day to day , every day on the handwritten menup57prepared by Home bore a different name . Horne , Mrs. Begley , and Agnes were all that remained of the large indoor staff that had once filled the attic of Plumes . The other two members of the present indoor staff were maids of perhaps half Agnes 's weight and years . They were flibbertigibbets who refused to live in . They preferred cyclingover from a nearby village , and the hours they kept were so unreliable that debates about them provided the main topic of conversation belowstairs . " Listen whilst I give those two tarts a piece of my mind , " Horne would say to Bailey , and without putting it into so many words he would succeed in expressing his conviction that at least once upon every journey to and from Plumes the girls were off their bicycles and under a hedge with some lustful lout of a farmer 's son . The girls accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that they were virgins and that all night in their movie-riddled dreams they burned with longing not to be . Nowadays , the outdoor staff consisted of a gardener and a groom . Such lawn as the forest had not yet invaded the gardener kept in rough order with a cumbersome horsedrawnmower , which clanked and whimpered and chewed at the grass instead of cutting it . The groom was on hand to attend to the horse and to observe with resignation that his neglect of his duties had caused fifteen of the sixteen box stalls of the stables to be sealed off with cobwebs ; heavy with dust , the webs ran from post to post and in them hung the withered corpses of hundreds of long-dead spiders and their uneaten prey . Nicky and John were hopeful that , if the weather were ever to clear , a couple of horses could be rented from some fox-hunting farmer in the neighborhood . The Major , on one of his earliest visits to the house ,  |p58had  assured them that there would be . No difficulty . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two box stalls for occupancy and to lay in fresh straw and feed . It was the first strenuous work he had been called upon to perform in a decade ; daily , he pointed out that stable dust was well known to give him asthma and that many a good man with asthma had waked up one morning to find himself dead . Until the horses could be brought in , Nicky and John contented themselves with devising a variety of indoor games . The billiard room became their sports center . Here , for an hour every morning , they jogged in place , did pushups , and Indian-wrestled on the threadbare carpet , out of which from time to time emerged a startled moth . When they took off the cover of the pool table , they discovered that the green felt surface had sprouted spores from dampness . Perhaps the spores were the beginnings of mushrooms , perhaps not ; the naturalist in Nicky gave way to the games player in John , and with one of Mrs. Begley 's scrub brushes they swept the felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table was unexpectedly exposed . Balls and cues were found and a pool tournament was organized , in which the Major , Horne , Bailey , John , and Nicky were participants . Only the Major had ever played pool before , and he had not played in thirty years . With his usual competitiveness , John spent hour after hour in hard practice and acquiredsufficient skill within a week to outscore the Major . Nicky was beside himself with pride in John 's victory , and the Major appeared not to take his humiliation too much to heart . " Very good show , " he said , shaking John 's hand . " Thank you , sir , " John said , with an embarrassed air . He was sorry to have beaten an older man , but he wouldp59have been sorrier still to have been beaten by him . For John , winning was the first rule of life ; he was sometimes impatient with Nicky for not seeming to recognize a rule so obvious and so easy to follow . " Somebody has to lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , " Yes , but not you , not me ! Losers are dead and they do n't even know it . " Nicky thought otherwise , but he loved John too much to say so . Because it was the first time he had been in love , he could n't be sure how far one was allowed to go in the matter of disagreements . He would have to find his way . It appeared that everything about the feeling of loving somebody included having to find one 's way from one treacherous moment to the next . And this made one happy , as the solving of any difficult puzzle does . As for John , if he happened to notice that Nicky loved him , he never gave a sign . There had always been Nickys who looked up to him and loved him , and there always would be . It was something no more remarkable to him than the sweetness of the air he breathed . Major Merriot was a small , shapely man , with graying hair and a limp  --  the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a horse many years earlier . The old injury gave the Major no pain , except in winter , but it made it impossible for him to wander long distances about the countryside , as he had once liked to do . He had made Horne his companion in those days ; they had had high old times together . Nicky asked Horne what it was that the Major did , and Horne replied , " He is a gentleman . " That , Nicky saw , sufficed . It was after his accident that the Major had married . The girl was a cousin of his , daughter of anp60invalid parson in a neighboring parish . Those Merriots , Horne indicated with some delicacy , were even poorer than the Merriots of Plumes , who were the Merriots . With still more delicacy , Horne indicated that the Major must have been hoping for an heir , but nothing of the kind had occurred . A painful subject . On the Major 's death , Plumes would pass to a nephew , a brilliant young man who , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also doing very well in a big bank in London . The lad knew where his responsibilities lay . Fifty years from now , Horne said , his old face alight , Plumes would again be the finest holding in all of the West Country , from Donegal to Galway Bay . In the first few days of the family 's stay at Plumes , the Major was reluctant to make frequent visits to the house . Claire asked him to bring his wife round for cocktails a day or so hence , and at first he demurred . " Must n't be underfoot , you know . Your house now . " Still , he accepted the invitation when Claire proffered it for the third time  --  " My wife says you 're extremely kind . We do n't get to see . As many people as we ought . For her sake , you know . She 's very young . " Promptly at six , he and his wife were ushered into the morning room by Horne . " Major and Mrs. Merriot , " Horne said gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Kate Merriot was small like her husband , but with ample flesh on her bones ; her body moved freely inside a trifle of a dress , offering itself to the world as if unclothed , and she shook hands with vigor . Claire had learned from Horne that Mrs. Merriot was twenty years younger than her husbandwhich is to say that she must be somewhere in the middle thirties ; even for a woman of that age she looked exceptionally young . The Major was all self-effacing de/corum ; his charm lay in part in his being so difficult to confronthead on . One pursued him and made him turn round and give one the benefit of those shy , unprovokable brown eyes . His wife was insouciant . Her grace as she swung round the room , openly sizing up her new acquaintances , made a pleasing demand on one 's attention . How she must have rejoicedto escape the invalid parson ! Liking her at once , Claire said , " We 're making your morning room into our morning-noon-and-night room . We find it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , but this is where we live , too , do n't we , love ? " Kate Merriot said . " It 's why the chairs are all sat out and the sofa springs so disgustingly disemboweled . " " Very hard use . The furniture gets , " said her husband , with a glance toward Mrs. Fennelly . He would not wish her upset by the vividness of his wife 's figures of speech . No fear  --  something about the Merriots had put Mrs. Fennelly in a good mood . She had held them somehow to blame for the weather and the chill with which she was threatened , but she sensed now that they , too , were victims and would always take her side . She said , " It 's a charming room . Once upon a time , it must have enjoyed a delightful view of the sea . " " The view 's still there but for those rotten damn trees , " Kate said . For that was the pity of it : the house had been sited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby scruffy growth of seventy-year-old poplars . The sea view from the morning room had once been thought especiallyfine ; early nineteenth-century travelers in Ireland had given the room and the view a certain celebrity . The room was lit by a semicircular bay in the Gothic style . Sixp62pointed windows looked out over a graveled terrace to the poplars , whose highest branches were alive with rooks , damnably cawing . The embrasure of the bay was a step above the rest of the room and had something of the air of a memorial chapel in some tiny country church . On seeing it , Claire 's first thought was that it was in want of an altar ; characteristically , she then thought that it would prove the ideal place in which to install a bar . With her gift for improvisingmuch out of little , that afternoon she helped John and Nicky carry in from the laundry an old flatiron-scarred wooden table , which she covered with a bed sheet that fell on all four sides to the floor . On the table she placed a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some silver candlesticks , an ice bucket , and a score of gleaming , assortedtumblers and goblets and wine glasses . The fire on the hearth at one side of the room cast a yellowy glow into the depths of the silver and glassware in the embrasure ; more light fell into their depths from the candles on the bar itself . Standing in the room , one looked past the place of libation , winking with reflected firelight and candlelight , out into the cold rain that marched in slanting pencil strokes across the lawn and pelted the windows , and one felt as snug and warm and safe as if one were in the cabin of some stout ship at sea . Kate clapped her hands in admiration . " Ah , how lovely , how reassuring that bar is ! Why did we never think , Richard , trolls that we are , of inventing such a thing ? " " Have n't the touch , " said the Major . " One has to have . The touch . " Kate said , " If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub of vodka , thumbing my nose at the world . " " My wife can say , " said the Major to Mrs. Fennelly , " extraordinary things . "  | " You 'd catch your death , " said Mrs. Fennelly , that sensible woman , tightening her shawl about her shoulders . Reaching up , Kate took John 's face between her hands and gave it a close scrutiny . " You 're as Irish as Paddy 's pig , " she said . " I hope you 'll like it here . " " We 're having a great time , " John said , feeling his cheeks ablaze against the smoothness of her palms . " Are n't we , Nicky ? " It was a cry for help , John 's first cry , and Nicky said , " Let 's you and me go get some Cokes . " He tugged at John 's sleeve and began to draw him backward out of the room . Claire said , " Dear John  --  be an angel and bring us back some cheese and biscuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Merriots she added , " Adorable boy ! My Nicky worships him . " Nicky ought to have been furious with his mother for telling the truth to strangers and therefore seeming to value the truth so lightly , but instead he felt grateful : more important to him than anything else was to hear the words spoken that he could not speak himself . He hoped that John had heard them and would let him know  --  oh , sometime , somewhere !  --  that he had heard . " These days , being so poor , we drink mostly wine , " Kate said , " but I dote upon spirits . Gin  --  oh , God , what bliss ! " She held a bottle aloft , turning it round in the candlelight . " Richard , love , I 'm going to ask Mrs. Gault to make me a Martini and so must you . " Claire said , " Just what I was planning to make for Mother and me . Major , why do n't you do the honors for all four of us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but you Americans . " He gestured apologetically toward Mrs. Fennelly ; what a blithering idiot he was ! He took pains to speak slowly inp64order not to make clumsy errors , and yet he always made them . Not for the world would he wish Mrs. Fennelly to suppose that he thought of her first as an American and then as an individual . " Have very different ideas . To ours , about proportions . " " When we were married , Richard used to make Martinis two to one . Perhaps it was that and not poverty that caused us to try wine instead . " Claire caught Kate 's eye ; at that instant they were ready to form a secret society , the sole purpose of which would be to play agreeable pranks on the world . The society would have but two members . " This first time , " Claire said , " let me make us all a nice American Martini . Next time , we 'll ask you , Major , to make us a nice Irish one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recognized a note of exultation in Claire 's voice that in the past had often spelled danger . It was Mrs. Fennelly 's guess that the Major was somehow in need of protection and that it might be up to her to provide it . She had grossly misread his character at their first meeting and was therefore in debt to him . He was anything but the professional charmer she had taken him to be ; his charm had a fear of failure in it  --  had , like his leg , suffered some irremediable injury , which had kept him from ever venturing as far afield as he may have wished to go . That could have been one of the reasons for his marrying his cousin  --  a course that Mrs. Fennelly regarded as always most unwise . The cases she could cite in Carolina ! She saw that within a week Claire would be infatuated with Mrs. Merriot and would not rest until Mrs. Merriot was infatuated with her . For once , Claire 's headlongways left Mrs. Fennelly unperturbed . Those two could take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the Major remained content . " I warn you , Major Merriot , " Mrs. Fennelly said , " my daughter is an unscrupulous woman . It amuses her to get people drunk . " " People get themselves drunk , Mother , as you very well know . The Major looks as if he must be every bit as well disciplined as you . " On her way to the bar , Claire had the temerity to clap the Major lightly on the shoulder . A sisterlygesture , though Mrs. Fennelly , observing it , feared otherwise . Well ! she thought , but I , too , have my weapons ; no one shall take advantage of him in my presence . Mrs. Fennelly had no reason to worry ; it struck Claire as inconceivable now that when she had begun corresponding with Major Merriot over the rental of Plumes she had speculated on whether the man who wrote such curious , crabbed replies to her inquiries might prove worthy of having an affair with . She stood beside Kate at the bar , pouring gin into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far was that the world was full of wonders and that one was constantly tempted to underestimate their number . She had flung herself into dozens of affairs , fearing always , and always falsely , that her share of the world 's wonders was just about to be used up . She had the feeling that the woman beside her knew more about the infinity of wonders in the world than she did , and more , too , about how capriciously they were distributed  --  Kate , buried here in the west of Ireland , while she , Claire , had the run of every city on earth ! She permitted a tincture of vermouth to fall into the shaker and then filled it with ice . She could sense Kate 's eyes studying her hands as she worked , and for a moment it appeared possible  --  no ; certain : oh , Christ , make it certain  --  that Kate would bend over and kiss them . Claire 's hands trembled , waiting . She picked up the shakerp66and swung it slowly back and forth like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four stemmed glasses , she thought , dismissing the fantasy of her kissed hands . Ice in the glasses . If indeed it had been a fantasy . Four strips of lemon peel . She emptied the ice from the glasses and poured out the Martinis . Their color was the palest whitegold . The leftover gin and vermouth went into the second shaker ; it was the cardinal rule of Martini-making that there be no dilution . Knowing even that much , she was surely not the worst hostess in the world . She rubbed the rims of the glasses with the peelings , then squeezed them and dropped them into the drinks . Handing one to Kate : " You be mine . " A beat . Two beats . " My official taster . " " Oh , God ! Delicious ! " " You , Major . " Claire handed him his drink , then carried a drink across the room to where Mrs. Fennelly sat stubbornlyerect by the hearth . " And one for my dear old suspicious mother , who has never been drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ashamed of , " said Mrs. Fennellyto the room at large . " I will not grovel to Claire because I have led a respectable life and she has not . " " Hear , hear , " said the Major , then bit his tongue . He had been reckless again . Getting ready to applaud the first part of Mrs. Fennelly 's statement , he had not anticipated the reference to Mrs. Gault 's private life . " I beg your pardon , " he said to Claire . " No , no , Mother is perfectly right ! I am a scandalous person . " Those words were for the Major , but the rest were not : " You touch me at your peril . " " Moreover , " Mrs. Fennelly said , determined to hold the Major 's attention , " I intend to go on being respectable . " The Major thought it over  --  how likely was it that thisp67remarkable lady would be lowering standards at her age ?  --  and then risked a second " Hear , hear . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Mrs. Fennelly 's chair . " Ireland , " he said , " is a good place . To stay sober in . If you can stand it . " He tasted his drink for the first time . " Ah , Jesus , Mary , and Joseph ! " he burst out , in a cataract of speech . " Ah , that 's a beautiful Martini , that is . " Claire and Kate sank simultaneously into the cushions of the disemboweled sofa , whose springs rang out sharply in protest . Nicky and John tramped in from the kitchen bearing trays : cheese and biscuits for the grownups , peanut butter and jelly and brown bread for the growing boys . Claire lifted her glass above her head , holding it in both hands as if it were a chalice . " To ourselves ! " she said , and the four adults drank . A few moments later , she added , " To each other ! " and again they drank . For the second time that afternoon she caught Kate 's eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked to take chances , true that the greater the risk of failure the greater the exhilaration of success . There were emotions she had felt in childhood that she would never outgrow with age , and that was one of them . From the fireplace , unexpectedly , Claire heard her mother chirping , " To each other ! " and the Major replying , " Hear , hear ! " Nicky and John had seated themselves cross-legged on the floor , with a checkerboard between them . Checkers was the one game at which Nicky could invariably defeat John . It was distressing to Nicky not to play the fool and let John win , but John could tell as if by instinct when an adversary was not fighting his hardest ; he would have despised Nicky if Nicky had ever done less than his best . Their two heads almost touched above the checkerboard ; they had shut outp68the murmur of adult voices , the sh-h-h of the rain on the French windows . Claire and Kate lay back in the sofa , hands almost touching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fennelly , that accomplished conversationalist ( she who could hold her own in Venice and Bar Harbor ) , was drawing out the Major about local sights . She assured him that she was a born sight-seer , and so was Bailey . As soon as the weather cleared , she wished to organize a series of short daily excursions in the Rolls . Bailey liked castles best and , after them , ruins , but great houses would do very well ; such natural wonders as waterfalls and caverns were of no interest to Bailey or herself . She was counting on the Major to help her make plans . He said he would be delighted to do so . She was also counting on his joining them on any expeditions that might prove of interest to him . That was most kind : in recent years he had missed such expeditions very much . Mrs. Merriot must come as well , of course . Alas , the Major feared that his wife did not share his enthusiasm for the West Country and its illustrious past  --  pirates , shipwrecked Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that his chief companion in the seeking out of local lore had always been old Horne . It was Horne who had fished with Yeats at the trout pool here at Plumes . Horne remembered Lady Gregory driving up in a wicker pony trap from Coole to fetch Yeats home ; he did a capital imitation of Lady Gregory 's vexation with Yeats for having fished so long when he had poems to write . Mrs. Fennelly was delighted to add Horne to their little band of explorers . There would be plenty of room for him on the front seat beside Bailey . They got on splendidly with each other . Perhaps Bailey would let Horne help him with the road maps , several of which , to Bailey 's indignation , had turned out to be in Gaelic.  | " Crown my king , " Nicky cried , in a stricken voice , in the bearable misery of love . Claire sprang up to pour another round of drinks . At first the Major protested that they must n't outstay their welcome . Mrs. Fennelly said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and from the depths of the sofa Kate called out to him that there was no need to hurry away  --  as soon as Mrs. Begley had dinner ready , she would make sure that Horne announced the fact and they would take an immediate departure . " Mrs. Begley keeps us . All on schedule . A holy terror , " Major Merriot said , and held out his glass . As Claire was filling her glass and Kate 's , she noted a sudden change in the sound of the wind . She stood in the embrasure , feeling as eager and greedy as a child . She wanted to be out running barefoot in the storm ; she wanted also to be indoors , among these people in this room , with the fire burning and the gin lovely inside her . And she was like a child , too , in her satisfaction with herself ; she was glad she had green eyes and a slender body , glad to be desirable , glad to be falling in love . " Listen , my God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined Kate and Claire in the embrasure , peering out : six Noahs at six windows , waiting for a sign . Where the kitchen wing projected at an angle from the house , they could see Horne and Bailey at one window , Mrs. Begley and Agnes at another . The rain had almost stopped , but the wind was rushing in now at gale force off the sea . It screamed in the trees and tore at the ivy along the window frames . A gull was blown past the kitchen wing , struck a corner of the house outside the morning room , and fell onto the waterlogged terrace . Nicky was all for plunging out and rescuing it , but before he could do so the gull picked itself up and , evidently abandoning hopep70of flight , waddled off , head down , slowly inland , away from harm . Something cracked in the direction of the sea . One of the high , leafy poplars swayed violently to and fro , as if it were the only tree among so many that had been singled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooks ' nests , its topmost branches bent , bent , and then could bend no more ; the entire tree was lifted up , hurled sidelong , and uprooted , a ball of sticky , wet earth rising out of the turf at the base of the trunk as the upper trunk struck and shudderedalong the ground . Another tree was leveled and then another , until within a few minutes some twenty or thirty trees lay scattered in a debris of leaves , branches , and hairy roots across the lawn . In the gap caused by the fallen trees , they saw for the first time what the builders of the house had intended them to see  --  the great gray spume-covered Atlantic , thrashing at the foot of the cliffs of Plumes . A thread of yellow light broke and widened and then vanished in the western sky . " Tomorrow , " said the Major , " you will see the sun . " Claire raised her glass . " One last toast , " she said . " Mother ! " Nicky said , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious for the frequency of her toasts ; she proposed them on every possible occasion , public and private . Birthdays , holidays , picnics , weddings , christenings  --  it scarcely mattered so long as a glass was at hand . In the lemon-yellow dining room of the big house on Gramercy Park , she would have hurled her glass into the fireplace ; here at Plumes , until she had had the opportunity to lay in her own supply of glassware , she would resist the temptation . " Now , Nicky , " Mrs. Fennelly said . " Let your mother have her little toys . As you have yours . "  |p71John  said , " Here it comes  --  the beginning of the end ! Damn it , Nick , I never learn . " " Johnnie , you do ! You 're getting better every day . Look at all the men you still have ! " John 's words astonished Claire . For they were hers . She had uttered them silently just before he spoke : the beginning of the end . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the same moment , but it was likelier that she had put them into John 's mind by thinking them  --  by charging the snug room with them , as it was charged with firelight and the sour odor of coal smoke and the sweet smell of their bodies . She had been thinking that this evening marked , for her mother and Nicky and her , the real beginning of their holiday ; and then she had thought that it almost certainly marked the end of their holidays together . She had thought it coolly , without the least taint of melodrama ( she who in the old days would have doted on a scene  --  would have uttered the dread words aloud in hopes of making their flesh creep ) ; she would keep the thought to herself . Tomorrow , the Major had said , there would be sun . If he were right , the boys had a dozen projects ready to undertake . The Major would help them to rent a couple of likely horses . The gardener would help them to lay out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sneezing groom had volunteered to assist them in rigging up a basketballcourt in the carriage shed . They would be sending off to Dublin for a basketball and a hoop and a backstop , and if the carriage shed should prove too small for their purposes , the Major had proposed that they mark out a court in the shuttered ballroom . Mrs. Fennelly and Bailey would be plotting the first of their excursions . Perhapsp72Horne would take them to see the burial place of his old fishing companion in Drumcliff churchyard  --  Bailey was very keen on graves . If the weather was warm as well as sunny , there would be bathing on the beaches that bounded the southern portion of Plumes . Claire imagined herself lying on the sand beside Kate , their bodies baking . Her honey color would turn brown , then bronze . The skin of Kate 's body would be very white , and they would have to take great care that she did n't burn . They would fix up a makeshift shelter of parasols and lie beneath it , reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all those shining days to come , and of course it could not , and she said , " To the happiest summer of our lives ! " " Mother , how soppy ! " Nicky said . " On the contrary , " said his grandmother , " I call that a very nice toast . " " Hear , hear , " said the Major . Kate was content to remainsilent , tasting the gin , delicious on her tongue and lips . Except for the boys , they were all a little drunk . They were drawing close . They watched in wonder as , despite its great weight , a twenty-foot-high sphere of broken green branches bowled past the windows , driven uphill by the gale . It was becoming a night of signs . After dinner , John and Nicky wanted , they said , to go out and clamber about on the rocky cliffs , feeling valiant and endangered . They wanted to rescue from the murderous Atlantic who could guess what  --  a gull ? a wrack of seaweed and broken spars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes together . " Can we go , Mother ? " " We 'll see . " " Johnnie and I have to know right now ! " " Imperious Nicky ! " He was coming to have his father 's face , and tonight , for the first time , he pleaded with thep73same ardor . Poor Nicholas Gault , he had got his way in the end ; much good it had done him . Nicky would be wiser , in part because he was her son . Of course she liked him . Of course she admired him . Someday perhaps they would be friends . " Then , yes , " she said . " Take care , " said the Major , " you do n't drown . Give Plumes . A bloody bad name . " Horne stood in the doorway : " Madam , dinner is served . " " ' In a few minutes , Horne , " said Mrs. Fennelly . She wore a mask of total sobriety ; very convincing it was . She was making an effort . The facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have our guests to say good-bye to . " For a moment they all stood about shaking hands and saying , " Good night ! Good night ! , " unwilling to let the party end . Claire had foreseen correctly that Plumes would be the last of the houses that the three of them would visit together . Throughout the fall and into the winter , for no reason that her doctors could agree on , Mrs. Fennelly began to fail . She became rickety , and in her pride she would not conceal from Claire and Nicky that the usual miseries of age were closing in on her . She noted the progress of her decay with interest and described it ably . She was certain she would not be leaving Carolina again . If Claire wished the European Rolls as a gift , she was welcome to it ; otherwise , Mrs. Fennelly would put it up for sale . She was thinking of selling the American Rolls as well . Bailey , she wrote , had never been so disagreeable ; she was retiring him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farthest possible distance from the main house . In the late winter , turning over in bed , Mrs. Fennellyp74felt her hips crack , neatly and without pain . She spent several months in bed , wearing one or another of the pretty lace bed jackets that Claire kept sending down to her from New York . They spoke often on the phone , as they had always done , but curiously there was less and less to say . Having no future to make plans for and discuss , they bored each other with their small talk . As Mrs. Fennelly saw death approaching , she was surprised to discover that she had no urgent messages to impart . She was relieved that she would die before she had had time to grow dotty  --  one of her oldest friends had recently picked up a miniature Yorkshire terrier and placed it with care in a whirring Waring blender . She had a mild stroke and then a second and more severe one . She could remember the German word for " oak tree , " taught her in childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch she could not remember her daughter 's name . Eichbaum , but not . . . ? For a week or so there were nurses round the clock ; bed trays , bedpans . She phoned Nicky at school . He was tongue-tied , as he always was on long-distance . She spoke with a show of crispness and took care to say " Good night " to him and not " Good-bye . " She was drowsy and abstracted ; it was proving easier to let go than she had expected . The last thing she ever saw , through half-shut eyes , was one of her nurses stealing a bottle of perfume from her dressing table . And the last thing she thought was how remarkable it was that it did n't seem to matter ; there , she thought , that 's dying for you . A private funeral ceremony of mumbled psalms and prayers was held in the big front room of the Larkin house , after which Claire and Bailey took Mrs. Fennelly 's ashes out into the rose garden . Bailey scattered the ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nightfall would flush from the petals . Nicky did not attend the funeral . It would have been foolish to snatch him out of school with the end-of-term examinations only a few days off , but the possibility of doing so never arose  --  Nicky said flatly that he would not go . " I do n't believe in funerals , " he said . Claire said , " Neither do I. Skip this one and then skip mine . " " Did Grandma leave a lot of money ? " " The lawyers have n't told me yet , but the answer is sure to be yes . " " If she left some to me , I want to go to Indonesia this summer . " " Darling , whatever for ? " " There 's a kind of salamander there I want to look for . Nobody 's seen it for years . We might be the lucky ones who rediscovered it . " " We ? Is this an invitation ? " " John said he 'd come , if I could swing the money part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have him for a friend . " " I know . " So Nicky 's days as a traveler with her were ended . He was getting ready to become whatever he had it in him to be  --  a naturalist , a scamp , a nobody . It would be motherly in her to admire him and she wished to do so , but she found it difficult . Nicky 's unformedness had given her nothing to get a grip on , and now that he was taking form at last he would not be held . How little she had learned about him over the years ! That he liked snakes , that he liked horses . That he liked , so it now appeared , salamanders , if salamanderswere different from snakes . Rummaging about in thep76library at Plumes , Nicky had discovered in an old book on the fauna of Ireland that the country had no woodpeckers , voles , or common shrews , though it had an abundance of smooth newts and natterjack toads . He had been so proud of bringing them the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was n't a mother entitled to more than a few bleak facts of nature on which to base her admirationof a son ? Having so little gift for parenthood , Claire and Mrs. Fennelly had been helpless not to do Nicky harm ( " We know , do we not , that he is not a very happy child ? And we know why ? " ) . Nevertheless , he had survived , as Claire herself had survived , by a hundred ruses of accommodation ; the ignominy of his years of subjection was at an end . With the help of John , and of all the other Johns to come , this gloomy boy might grow up into quite a happy stranger . In that case , Claire and he would find firm ground for friendship ; she had always sought out happy people . Her luncheons and dinner parties were famous not only for their food and wine but also for their merriment . It was possible that Nicky and she might yet become friends ; though not probable . She hardened her heart against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she caught herself , marveling that she dared to pass judgment on something she had scarcely known . In all the years of their bickering , how often had the three of them ever risked drawing close ? Was n't it once only , in the green fastness of Plumes ? And now she was alone . The words had a grim sound , but she was far from feeling grim . In the drawing room of her house on the Park , under the great , glimmering mirror , she said aloud in celebration , " I am alone . " People would be asking her how she could bear to rattle around by herself in all those empty rooms and shep77would answer that she looked forward to enjoying the emptiness for a while ; there would be plenty of time later for her to fill the house with parties . She looked up at the golden mandarins , her household gods , whispering old secrets among themselves . She felt exalted . Her mother was dead . Her son was rushing away from her into the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to the simplest things last . And so she was . And it was not too late.  |p78The  MischievousSinfulnessof Mother CoakleyEven in old age , Mother Coakley was as round and smoothskinnedas an apple . In her billowing black habit , she had the air of being about to be caught up in a gust of mountain wind and carried aloft to the sunny corner of heaven that had long been set aside for her . Not that she was in any hurry to go . She loved God , but she also loved life . " He knows where to find me when the time comes , " she said to Father Naylor , the chaplain of the convent school . " Sure , I have n't budged from this spot in fifty years . " Father Naylor had a weakness for drink , which was a problem especially serious for a priest . He had a second problem  --  one that , again because he was a priest , was scarcely less serious than the first . It was a horror of death . He was revolted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person made him ill ; on more than one occasion , performing the last rites , he had fallen unconscious beside the bed . As a parish priest out in the world , he could never avoid this horror . In his eyes , the best thing about the convent school was that it was filled with laughing , teen-age girls , who looked as if they would live a thousand years.  |p79The  Bishop 's theory in placing Father Naylor in the school was that keeping him away from the one problem might keep him away from the other . The Bishop was a kind man , but a trifle simple-minded ; his theory had yet to be verified . Mother Coakley was well aware of Father Naylor 's attitude toward death , and that may have been the reason that she chattered on about it  --  she was convinced that it was good for people to have their noses rubbed in things they did n't wish to face . Besides , there was a touch of malice in Mother Coakley , for all her virtue . The obvious misery of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be many and many He has to scour the world for , " she said to Father Naylor , " but not me  --  the moment He whispers my name , I 'll be up and away , leaving not a pin behind . " It was true that she was a quick little thing ; if she moved in death as she had always moved in life , her guardian angel would be hard pressed to keep up with her in the race to heaven . On earth , her most notable manifestations of speed were on the tennis court . Despite the Mother Superior 's hints of disapproval  --  hints that by anyone else would have been taken as commands  --  Mother Coakley liked playing tennis with the younger convent girls . The court was on the crest of a hill behind the ramshackle wooden buildings that made up the convent chapel and school , and what seemed in the Carolina town in the valley below an agreeable summer breeze approached , on that dusty oblong of rootribbedand rocky court , the force and temperature of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot or cold . Gathering the full skirts of her habit into her left hand , she scampered about the court like ap80frantic chipmunk , letting her veil float out behind her in ghostly disarray and only just showing the tops of her high black shoes . She had learned to play tennis as a novice at the mother house in France , no one knew how many years ago , and she played it unexpectedly well . Like most people who learned the game in the early years of the century , she had little interest in rallying . She was prepared to lose point after point in order to attempt a ruthless high-bounding put-away or a cut shot that would drop ever so gently and venomously over the net ; when she had done so , the ball being unreturnable , Mother Coakley would drop her racket and clap her hands in unaffected delight . She had no use for the conventional courtesies of tennis . If she failed to return an opponent 's serve , she never called , " Good shot , " but , screwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " Drat it ! A six-year-old could n't miss a serve like that ! " As she played , her cheeks grew more and more deeply suffused with blood ; they went from pink to red to purple , and this was so alarming to her opponents that it impaired their game . They began to lose points out of fear of having to witness a massive cerebral hemorrhage right on the court . Mother Coakley took advantage of their fears by scorning them . She never heeded suggestions that it might be wise for her to rest for a few minutes between sets . " I always get to look like this , " she would say , panting heartily . The French crispness of tone taught her at the mother house in Dijon would slur away into the soft Irish brogue of her earliest childhood . " Sure , I looked like this in the cradle . Did n't the doctors and all despair of me ? Do n't give it a thought . Come take your beating . " Sinful Mother Coakley  --  base taunts were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outright cheating , she was unscrupulous in her desire to win . Where words would help her , she used words ; where delaying tactics were needed to confound an adversary , she would fall back upon one or another of a host of ignoble tricks . A favorite trick was the manipulation of her habit , with its numerous layers and mysterious fastenings . Luckily for her , she belonged to an ancient order , which felt no need to be in fashion ; the Mother Superior in Dijon had affirmed that gear which had been a la mode in the saintly thirteenth century might well be judged worthy to outlast the licentious twentieth . " Le genou , c'est le communisme , " she had written to Rome , and Rome had yet to contradict her . At a moment of crisis , with the score at , say , forty-love , Mother Coakley would astonish the server by suddenly retreating to a point back of the baseline and plunging both hands deep inside her habit , to adjust some strap or placket that had presumablygone askew . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interruption of that kind . Mother Coakley also made cunning use of her rosary , which , stuffed carelessly inside her belt at the start of a set , would work itself loose and flail about her waist until , with tears of excitement streaming down her cheeks and wisps of clipped gray hair showing at the sides of her wimple , she would be obliged , with a shout , to stop playing . " If I did n't , Lord love us , I 'd strangle myself on my own beads , " she said . " But for them , I 'd be happy to go on playing till dark . " Perhaps so and perhaps not so  --  it was nearly always the case that Mother Coakley used her beads as an excuse to stop playing while she was still ahead but had plainly begun to lose ground.  |p82Pride  ( wishing to be the best player in the convent ) , envy ( wishing to possess another player 's backhand ) , and greed ( wishing to keep the court when her allotted time was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain from year to year . In the months when frost and snow and the muddy rains of spring made the court unplayable , Mother Coakley was in and out of the confessionalin a matter of seconds and was finished with her penance so fast that , by the calculations of other nuns in the chapel , it could have consisted of little more than a token " Hail , Mary " or two . But in high summer and in the long , golden days of the Carolina autumn , the length of her stay in the confessional and the amount of time it took her to say her penance were the subjects of much whispered comment . Some of the younger nuns would dare to tease her about this as they made their way at night up the steep , worn stairs to their cells . " What a temper Father Naylor must have been in today ! " they would say . " To think of his making you suffer so because of his migraine . " " My penance is none of your business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation . " Kindly respectthe secrecy of the confessional . Vous connaissez les regles . " It happened that " migraine " was the nuns ' word for Father Naylor 's hangovers , which were prolonged and overlapping , and Mother Coakley took care to defend his good name as well as hers . " It strikes me as curious , " she said , " that at the very moment when you are expected to be contemplatingyour own no doubt manifold sins , and bitterly regretting the anguish they have caused Almighty God , you can find time to speculate upon the imaginary failings of others ! " She might be old , but her tongue was as sharp as her feet were nimble . The young nuns stared at her in lovep83and admiration : she was who they would like to become in the course of the long journey leading to their promised bridegroom . It was Father Naylor who was given the shock of his life when , late one windy October afternoon , he rounded a corner of the chapel and caught sight of a nun lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and knelt beside her . Even from a distance , something about the round shape of the body had let him know that it must be Mother Coakley . For once , her little face was as white as paper . Her racket lay where it had fallen ; the two or three balls with which she had been practicing shots against the backboardhad rolled this way and that , unregarded . Summoningall his courage , Father Naylor reached out and touched her forehead ; it was cold . Awkwardly , he called her name , knowing there would be no answer . He took out the vial of holy water that he carried with him always and sprinkled a few drops over the body . If there was the least faint tick of life left in her anywhere , it would be worthwhile giving her conditional absolution , and he did so . He was trembling with hangover and still more with fright . He had squandered his strength in the act of touching her ; now he was faced with the task of picking her up . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint ; then there would be two of them lying there on the court . He took out something else that he carried with him always : a flask of whiskey . He unscrewed the cap , tossed back an ounce or two above Mother Coakley'sunmoving face , screwed the cap back firmly into place , and returned the flask to his pocket . She would not have liked him to be afraid of her . She would have given him a good scolding for his cowardice . She would have madep84him rub his nose in it . But she would n't have minded his taking strength from the whiskey . Father Naylor worked one hand and arm under Mother Coakley 's neck and his other hand and arm under her bent knees . Slowly he lifted her and then , finding the burden easy , got to his feet and started for the convent . To anyone who did n't know the nature of his burden , Father Naylor would have seemed a jaunty figure , striding across the lawn in the clear dusk . The wind was freshening ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradled her in his arms as if against the cold . She did n't like winter to come , because it put an end to her tennis . She took the game seriously and seriously deplored her moral lapses in respect to it . She faced her sins  --  pride , envy , greed  --  head on and struggled to avoid them . Envy was the worst . Envy was her implacable foe . More than once in the confessional they had agreed that the best way for her to outwit her enemy would be for her to improve her skill . That was why she had been out at the backboard : she had been practicing for spring . He gave her a little toss in his arms ; oh , but she was light ! Like a bundle of feathers . And he was not afraid.  |p85Too  Late to Marry , Too Soon to DieThey sat at a table in one corner of the bar . For almost a month now they had sat every night at the same table and ordered the same number of drinks and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something under fifty . He was getting fat and his thin blond hair had darkened to the color of tobacco stain . The girl was twenty-six or twenty-seven , tall , white-cheeked , and pretty . She had straight black hair and blue eyes , and when she and the man spoke together her voice seemed somehow lower than his , perhaps only because it was steadier . " Want to hear the one about a man with a harelip trying to get fitted for a suit at Brooks Brothers ? " he said . And when she shook her head : " Anything to keep you from sitting there looking so goddam solemn . " " I 'm not solemn , I 'm merry . I 'm looking at all the merry people at the bar and thinking how merry they are . " " They 're a bunch of old rummies . " " Five old rummies , one young sailor , and three middleagedwomen with sagging bottoms . " They finished their drinks , and at a sign from the manp86the waiter went to the bar and fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man with gold-rimmed bifocals and a chin that hung ajar , easing his dentures , and his worn shoes went slap-slap over the sawdust-covered floor . The girl 's mouth was exquisite . She sipped her drink and shuddered and said , " I wish your china would break and your silver would be stolen and your house would burn down . I wish your wife and children would go on a five-year trip to the moon . And sometimes I wish you 'd go with them . " " We 're having one of our better evenings , are n't we ? " the man asked . The young sailor left the bar and entered the men 's room , directly across from their table . " A beautiful merry sailor , " the girl said . " With such nice merry eyes . " " He 's going to be sick . " " Poor lamb . I 've been watching him . He 's all alone in this rotten place . " " Why do n't you ask him home with you ? Tuck him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea ? " " I wish I could . " " For Christ 's sake , why not ? " " For one thing , there 's Ellen . " " You and that girl . People will talk . " " It was her apartment . She found it . I could n't afford it alone . " " I 'd pay her share . " " Oh , no , you would n't . " " Meaning you do n't think I would , or you would n't let me ? "  | " Something like that . " They could hear the sailor being sick behind the thin pine door . " Besides , " the girl said , " he 'd think I was a tramp . Quite an elderly one . " " Talking old age now , you 'll be a number-one bore at thirty . " " Give me a quarter . " " Not if it 's for that goddam song . " " Just once more . " " Number-one bore right now . " " Then I 'll ask the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the table , and the girl , picking up a quarter , walked to the jukebox beside the bar . She made her selection and drifted back across the room in a half dance , taking her time . She sat down , patting the man 's hand . " Ah , but it 's the lovely song , " she said , in a false brogue . " Too late to marry , too soon to die . ' " The record was loud and brassy ; it seemed to go on and on . The sailor came out of the men 's room as the record ended . He looked pale under his tan , and surprised and offended by what had happened to him . The girl said , " Sit down a minute . Before you fall . " The sailor teetered over them , glancing uncertainly back and forth between the man and the girl . The man took a drink and then , looking not at the sailor but at the girl , said , " You 're sick . Better get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got twenty-four hours . " The sailor was still so young that he was willing to walk away without making trouble , but he was also eager to carry some memory of a risky and gallant shore incident to sea with him . " Listen , mister , " he said , " it was her who started talking , not me.  |p88If  you want to make something out of it , I 'll be right up there at the bar . " The man smiled and said , " O.K. , sailor boy . " " And do n't call me sailor boy , hear ? " " O.K. , sailor . " And then silently , for the girl to see : " Boy . " The sailor ducked his head , frowning with an almost imperceptible fuzz of brows . " Excuse me , " he said to the girl and walked slowly , with a pallbearer 's dignity , back to the bar . The girl said , " God , what a shit you are . " The man finished his drink . " I let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? " " Mean , mean , mean , mean . You wanted me to speak to him for your sake , did n't you ? To set it up for you , so you could spit on him ? " He shook his head . " So I could see what you 'll be doing here this time next month . When Carol and the children come back to town , and I ca n't sit holding your hand every night in the week . " " Please , " the girl said . " Ah , please . You did n't have to tell me that . " The mascara she had brushed onto her lashes earlier in the evening had begun to print itself in straight wet lines against her upper lids . " Time to go home . " " To your neat , narrow little bed ? " " Narrow it is , neat it is n't . " " ' It 's early yet . Ellen will think we 've had a row . " " Ellen does n't know anything about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She only knows there 's someone . She thinks you 're tall and lean and dark , and can bring a girl off by just looking at her . " She took his hands . " There . Now we 're even . "  | " Finish your drink , " the man said . " You 're angry with me . Very well , then , I 'm sorry . " " Now you 're being childish . " " All right , fine , I 'm being childish . I 'm being anything you say . Only say you 're not angry with me . " " I 'm not angry with you . " " And you 'll see me tomorrow ? " " SI'l1 see you tomorrow . " The waiter came up to their table . His feet throbbed in his shoes , and his eyes looked dazed back of his goldrimmedbifocals . " Want your check ? " he asked , fumbling with a greasy pad , and it was as if he were saying , " Ah , for the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you quarrel in bed as well as here ? " The man said , " Bring us a couple of more drinks . " The waiter nodded and turned away , his shoes dragging in the soiled , two-day-old green sawdust . " I wish it were over , " the girl said , and that was the moment , though she was n't to know it till later , when , between one drink and the next and without another word spoken , her wish came true.  |p90The  TriumphTo Mrs. Battle and her daughter Edith , the issuing of the invitations to the tea was in itself a considerable event . This annual party was the point on which their year and their world revolved . As soon as the forced gaiety of Christmas was over , they started looking forward to the great day . Edith was fifty , Mrs. Battle seventy-three . In the last ten years they had grown to look like sisters . Both had flat cheeks , large chins , and thin gray hair . And when either one of them spoke of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same tones of courage and regret with which they spoke of their life in the city , so many years back now , or of the house they had later owned on the Torrington road , or the furniture and friends they had been forced to sacrifice . Edith and Mrs. Battle always set aside one whole day of the first week of January to walk down to the drugstore in the village and buy paper , envelopes , and a fresh bottle of ink . It took an hour or more to make a choice among Mr. Crabtree 's sleazy samples of stationery . Edith and Mrs. Battle sat down on the high stools at the soda fountain andp91took off their gloves to rub each sheet between their fingers . " If you 'd only told me we were out of paper , dear , " Mrs. Battle always said , " I could have written to Tiffany 's for the usual . The dies are there . " They tested two or three bottles of ink before they found the particular shade of light blue they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the next week , when they could no longer bear to leave the paper untouched , Edith and Mrs. Battle would carry the telephone book up to their small , square room on the second floor of Mrs. O'Connor 's boardinghouseand copy from it a list of possible guests . This , together with a list of their friends outside the village , totaled nearly a hundred persons . After twenty years , the Battles knew perfectly well whom they intended to invite , but it was a sacred custom to savor and reject the remainder , name by name . " What about Mrs. Roger Shipstead ? " Mrs. Battle would ask on the first day , her finger happening to rest against that name in the book . Edith would say , " We 'll write it down , in case . " On the following day , when they began to prune their list of the more obviously distant acquaintances , Edith would say , " I 've Mrs. Roger Shipstead here . " Mrs. Battle always pretended to waver  --  " Let 's wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cut Mrs. Shipstead from the list . " We 've never had her , you know , " she would say , and Mrs. Shipstead would drop from their thoughts for another year . The list took shape finally as the Battles had known it would . They were always careful that , of the twenty-five invitations they sent out , eighteen would be to those acquaintances in New Haven and New York and Philadel/phia and Washington who were certain not to attend but who bore uniformly distinguished names . One was a former governor of Connecticut ; one was the president of Yale ( whoever he happened to be  --  the Battles were an old Yale family ) ; one an elderly gentleman who , in Hoover 's time , had been minister to one of the Scandinavian countries . The remaining invitations were always sent to a handful of friends in the village , who never thought of refusing them , and to perhaps one new friend , by way of adding a sense of risk to the occasion . The risk this year was Mrs. Paraday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , whose vigor appalled and attracted Edith . She said whatever she pleased and gave the impression that all her life long she had done whatever she pleased . Mrs. Battle asked , " Who are her people ? " and Edith answered , " None living , I believe . " " That fails to answer my question . " " New York , " Edith said , then risked adding , " Old New York . " " I do n't believe it for a moment . What was her maiden name ? " " I ca n't recall her having mentioned it . " " And no wonder . Irish blood there , you mark my words . " Mrs. Battle had a low opinion of the Irish . There was something the matter with their blood . In that respect they were very like the Poles and the Spanish and the blacks . " People who touch pitch  --  " Mrs. Battle said . " I warn you not to go running after Mrs. Paraday . " " I , who 've never run after anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be with the clear understanding that she is very much on probation . " " She 's not my Mrs. Paraday , and if you 're going to carryp93on like this , I 'd a thousand times rather not have her at all . " " Fiddlesticks ! " said Mrs. Battle , her old heart afire with jealousy . " You 've a crush on her , that 's all . The sooner you get over it , the better . " Edith burst into tears , and for forty-eight hours , living in the same room , sleeping in the same bed , they spoke not a word to each other . The inconvenience of silence at such close quarters and the need to get on with the preparations for the tea party caused them at last to come to terms ; and by then each felt that she was forgiving the other . As usual , the writing of the invitations took scarcely an afternoon . " Mrs. Robert Gardiner Battle and Miss Edith Nevins Battle , " Edith wrote down , again and again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home Monday , January twenty-seventh , four to six . R.S.V.P. " Then , with Mrs. Battle sitting on the bed and calling out names in a voice charged with excitement , Edith addressed the twentyfiveenvelopes . The next morning they walked down to the post office to buy the proper number of stamps from the postmaster . This made it possible to show him some of the letters addressed to New Haven and New York and Philadelphiaand Washington , since they always affixed the stamps at his window and even asked him to weigh one of the letters to make sure that it had sufficient postage . Togetherthey dropped the invitations , with slow caution , into the brass-plated slot in the wall . All through the next week they received at least two letters of regret a day . " Is n't it a shame ? " Mrs. Battle said , reading one of them . " Mrs. Amory writes from Washington that she and the Senator have promised themselves for dinner on Monday . " In the end they received , as they did each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia and Washington , and seven letters of acceptance from their friends in the village . On the morning of the tea , they dropped in at the bakery shop and purchased three dollars and fifty cents ' worth of sandwiches and cakes . Then they hurried back to the house to make ready the front parlor . At noon , Mr. Atwood , a middle-aged bachelor who worked at the Brown Lumber Company and was the most presentable of Mrs. O'Connor 's five other boarders , obligingly brought in wood for a fire and laid it with his own hands . Edith carried the canary down from upstairs to give the room a more homey look . They dared not remove Mrs. O'Connor 's portrait of the late Pope from its place of honor above the mantel , but , as former members , during their New York days , of the Brick PresbyterianChurch , they diminished his presence by setting a bowl of bittersweet before the picture . They went without lunch in order to give themselves time to bathe and dress . Mrs. Battle always wore a lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . She had bought it at Altman 's fourteen or fifteen years before , but , as she often said , " The material 's so much better than what you can get nowadays , it would be criminal to think of giving it away . " Edith wore a dress she had bought in Winsted some years back . With the changes she had made in it this year , it looked almost like new . At four o'clock , with a card table crammed with plates , cups , and Mrs. O'Connor 's green porcelain teapot , and a cozy fire burning on the hearth , the Battles sat down and waited for their guests . They were so moved by the occasion that they could scarcely speak . No one ever came before five.  |p95The  room clinked with china saucers and cups . The fire on the hearth cast skeins of smoke over the partly empty plates of sandwiches and cakes . Next to Mrs. Battle sat Miss Day . She , too , had lived in New York and knew many of the people Mrs. Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered times , she still kept three servants in the green-and-lemon-colored house on the hill . Beyond Miss Day sat Mrs. Urbino , the nice Italian Dr. Urbino 's wife , who showed by her silence how grateful she was for being asked to the Battles ' tea . On the other side of the room , Edith , together with Mrs. Reuben Clark , who was eightyfour , and her granddaughter , and Edith 's friend Mrs. Paraday , kept up a drumfire of whispers and giggles . Mrs. Battle felt that the annual tea was a great success . " My parents could remember Brooklyn , " Miss Day was saying , " before the Bridge . I hate to think what age that makes me , but they could . It was like the open country in those days , all woods and brooks and sandy shore . And the nicest people ! " " Why , in those days , " Mrs. Battle said , sitting as straight and motionless on her little wooden chair as a queen on a velvet throne , " in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been dreamed of . They did n't exist . If anyone had dared to live in a village like this , a hundred miles from New York , they'd 've been thought quite mad . " Mrs. Battle lifted her teacup lightly in her mottled hands . The canary fluttered and scolded in a cage above her shoulder as she talked . " My mother was a Nevins  --  one of the oldest of the old Brooklyn families . When I was a little girl , we lived on Washington Park South , in the loveliest home , with a long green garden that I always think of as full of pompons and cosmos and nettles . We had a coachp96house covered with lattices at the end of the garden , and I remember the horses my father kept there  --  two black ones with white feet and white stars on their foreheads . He called them Gog and Magog . " " What a marvelous memory ! " Mrs. Urbino said . It was almost the only remark she had made all afternoon . " Later , the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was about ; money was as much a mystery to me then as it is today  --  and my father had to surrender everything he owned , but he refused to give up his horses . " Mrs. Battle drew a slow breath , building a stage of silence under her voice . Each year she enjoyed this moment more . For this was how to live : tea , cakes , friends , a fire , a story . " He went down to the coach house the morning we had to move away . He said good-bye to the horses and lifted a pistol out of his pocket and shot them dead , just where they stood in their stalls . My mother and I were waiting for him on the front stoop and we heard the shots . He could n't bear to do anything else . " " Imagine living in Brooklyn today and having such a memory ! It would be horrible , " Mrs. Paraday said , and burst into prolonged laughter . Wave on wave , the sound rose in the crowded room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cage . Mrs. Battle lifted the lid of the teapot , studied the black tea , and replaced the lid . In all the times she had told that story of her father 's horses no one had ever followed it with a less appropriate remark . She smiled , all courtesy . " Do have another cup of tea , Mrs. Paraday , " she said . " Such a cold day . " Mrs. Battle pressed her hands to her eyes for a moment . The last of the guests had gone . Edith and she had repeatedp97for the last time the words " Do drop in again very soon , " which everyone knew better than to believe . They lifted the plates from the table and carried them down the dark hall to the kitchen . Mrs. O'Connor was there , preparing supper . " How was the party ? " she asked . " Were you both the pride and joy of the day ? " " Everything was just as it should have been , " Mrs. Battle said . It was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . The Irish were nothing if not pushy . Nevertheless , today she could afford to unbend a little . " We have to thank you for the use of the room . And for your plates . " " Why should n't you have the use of the room whenever you want it ? " Mrs. O'Connor asked . " The rest of the boarders only use it at night , the big tramps in their dirty shoes ! " Edith and her mother found the stairs exhausting . Mrs. Battle lay down on the big double bed . She did not wish to hear Edith launch out on a long chatter of distress over Mrs. Paraday . Edith could be remarkably obtuse at times . In ordinary circumstances , apologies would certainly have been called for and , after due consideration , accepted , but these were far from ordinary circumstances . Mrs. Paraday 's gaucherie had made any further relationship between Edith and her an impossibility . She had proved herself , and not alone in the Battles ' eyes , a total outsider . Word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all over the village by nightfall : the clumsy grossness of the guest , the unfaltering magnanimity of the hostess . Surely Edith ought to see that apologies would open the door to discussions that no longer needed to take place . Mrs. Battle had played her trumps superbly . She had taken every trick . She was still a match for any of them . She heaved anp98artificially loud sigh , as a signal that she was falling asleep . That would keep Edith from bothering her . She lay there listening to her daughter as she fluttered nervously about the room . After so many years , the least sounds were easy to identify . A faint chck ! was Edith hanging the canary 's cage back on its accustomed hook . After a minute or two , finding himself at home between wardrobe and shoe rack , the bird would start singing . Just so , just so . Wrapped in glory , Mrs. Battle , pretending to fall asleep , fell asleep , and so never saw her daughter 's tears.  |p99SignsFather  Ryan opened the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He blew a drift of coal dust from the sill , then set his palms against it and leaned into the night . The air was hot . Rain was falling noisily on the tin roof , silently on the almost invisible statue of Mary crowningthe chapel . Between the house and the chapel , a bank of red Carolina clay had been cut to frothing gullies ; now and then a sizable stone would be washed free by the scouring water and would set off down the valley . The first day of the downpour , Father Ryan had said to Buck , his altar boy , " Now the heat is bound to break . Winter 's coming at last . " But Buck had said , " Hit do n't make no difference about the rain . Rain 'll just gobble up the air . " And that was what the rain had done . Father Ryan felt as if he had been drowning minute after minute for five days . From the open window , he looked out across the town . Hundreds of dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hillside , in the white section of town . Here in the black section , about the new Franciscan school and chapel , a handful of yellow lights swam in the dark . Fatherp100Ryan wondered , maybe for the thousandth time , how he was ever to learn what lay in the light of those lamps . This was missionary country  --  there were said to be fewer Catholics in Carolina than there were in China . With the rain falling and the roads growing impassable , he had had to dismiss classes two or three days before the proper time for Christmas vacation . The children had vanished without a trace into their sullen , unpainted , inscrutable shacks . Buck , who had been Father Ryan 's first convert , had missed Mass this morning for the first time . Unless the rain stopped soon , it was plain to Father Ryan that his year 's work might go for nothing  --  might go , he thought , unable to resist the grim joke , straight down the drain . Buck was sixteen , which was two years beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had trained him as an altar boy . This had turned out to be such excellent strategy that it caused Father Ryan to suffer an occasional twinge of conscience . He was thirty-three , and he believed in conversionby reason rather than example . Still , it was a fact of life that if what Buck called " rollin " Catholicism was good enough for Buck , it would be good enough for scores of young people in the neighborhood ; if it was n't , it would n't be . Simple and sometimes shameful were the means by which souls could be won for God . So far , Father Ryan had achieved what his superiors regarded as an exceptional success in the community , but he knew better than they did that it was all in continuous jeopardy . Watching the rain stream from the overhang of the tin roof , trying to draw a breath of the sour night air , Father Ryan noted without self-pity that he had no clear proof of his success . He stood alone on Christmas Eve in an empty house , beside an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the world thatp101lay about him was not his world and that it might prove , in the end , impenetrable . Had n't there been tens of thousands of black converts in Africa in the seventeenth century ? Had n't they built their own cathedrals in the jungle , and had n't they been presided over by their own archbishops and cardinals , appointed by the Holy Father in Rome ? And had n't the continent reared back and swallowed up the whole enormous , prosperous enterprise , church , priests , and laymen , leaving not the least word of God behind ? Father Ryan shook his head at his temerity  --  that was what living alone did for a man ! He had just narrowly escaped comparingthis dreary little pinpoint of a coal-mining town in the Smokies with all of West Africa . Still , if they had nothing else in common , they had this : that no one  --  especially no stranger  --  could ever hope to put a lasting mark on them . Father Ryan tightened his grip on the sill . He was living alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely , and that was a greater hardship . There had been an old monk at the seminary who sometimes at night , after he had a drop taken , would sigh and say that he was lonely , lonesome , and alone . Father Ryan used to wonder how he distinguished between " lonely " and " lonesome . " Perhaps there was a difference , and perhaps he was about to find out what it was . Tonight in the North , where Father Ryan had grown up , the snow would be lying deep in the yards or piled high beside the roads by the big plows . The air would be cold and sharp , the sky crowded with stars . Candles would be lighted in the windows of houses . Through the windows you could see trees covered with tinsel and ornaments , trees glittering with tiny bulbs . Father Ryan remembered seeing , a year or so earlier , a spruce higher than the house in frontp102of which it grew , and every branch of the spruce had been covered with lights . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary and the Child , and the moonlighthad fallen ice-blue , like satin , over Mary 's head and cradling arms . Up North , Father Ryan had seen Christmas in the faces passing him in the street . He had heard it in voices speaking while doors were opened and closed against the cold : " Come in , come in ! How good of you to stop by ! " " I ca n't stay . But I had to tell you merry Christmas . " He had been actually shaken by the sounds of Christmas , standing under the brassy amplifiers in the city park : " Oh , little town of Bethlehem , how still we see thee lie ! " In his room in that Northern parish house , Father Ryan had arranged , last year , his private Christmas celebration . He had set a shoe box on its side on the table beside his cot . He had covered it with pine twigs broken from shrubs growing around the house . He had placed inside the shoe box a plastic Jesus and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placid cows . When he had gone shopping that morning , he had had money enough to buy either a set of shepherds or a set of Wise Men . He had weighed the decision with care , while the girl behind the counter tapped with her painted nails on a hill of sparkling snow . Father Ryan had chosen the shepherds . They had seemed closer to him than the Wise Men , with their proud names and gorgeous raiment . That night he had propped the shepherds upright by the infant Jesus . Then he had knelt in front of the shoe box to say his rosary . For the moment , the rain appeared to be slackening . Father Ryan heard water foaming and chuckling in the gullies and circling the open foundations of the house . Hep103heard a report that might have been a shot fired at a rat in a nearby shanty , or a car backfiring . Somewhere down the slope a tethered donkey began to bray . Then the rain came down once more , through the sieve of heat , on the slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and glanced about his barren study . No wreaths , no creche , no twinkling lights . So many hundreds of miles from home , he had lacked the will to improvise a Northern Christmas . Besides , he had promised himself that , coming among these people , he would follow their customs . They had outwitted him by apparently having none . Ah , damn them , he thought , for shutting their doors in my face ! His supposed success among them was n't worth a straw for as long as he did n't know what they were thinking and feeling . No doubt they were using him by letting him win an occasionaltrophy for the Church from among their children . This was as it should be , because he was there to be used  --  it was a part of his giving himself to God to be used and not to know at the time , or perhaps ever know , whether he had been used for good or ill . It was the bleak misery of the not-knowing that created a loneliness beyond aloneness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drunken old monk had been hinting at and taking care to conceal from the young seminarian running full tilt at God ? No wonder that people who gave themselves to God were constantly on their knees to Him , begging for a sign . It was among the gravest of temptations and among the hardest to resist . Father Ryan heard a second report , followed by a sound of voices . Beyond the roof of the house and chapel , a faint glow colored the sky . It looked like a fire , which in thatp104neighborhood was a commonplace . Nearly every week a faulty stove set ablaze one of the paper-roofed shanties that surrounded the chapel ; within an hour or two nothing would remain but the brick piers on which the shanty had stood and the teetering chimney to which the stove had been attached . Leaning from the window , Father Ryan watched as the glow faded and then returned , closer to the chapel and much brighter than before . A yellow flare lighted the road in front of the house . He saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at him , and he called out , " What 's happened ? Is it a fire ? " Ankle-deep in mud , the boys surged under his window . He saw that Buck was in the lead , his bushy hair glittering with raindrops , a pine torch in his right hand . They shouted , " Merry Christmas , Father ! " and a dozen firecrackers explodedin the darkness above their heads . " Buck ! " he said . " What is this ? " His temper was short these days . He felt a wave of anger mounting in him . " What kind of crazy stunt are you kids staging ? " Buck 's eyes gleamed with pleasure . He lighted a fuse with his torch and sent a firecracker looping off to explode beyond the crowd . Buck said , " Do n't you all know how to celebrate Christmas up North ? " " You 're damn right we do ! " He glared down at Buck . It was as if in his anger he were bent on turning his first convertinto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Saviour , not the Fourth of July ! " The moment he uttered the words , he saw that he was being the biggest fool on earth and he bent down out of the window and said , " Buck ! Quick ! Give me one ! " Buck pulled a six-inch salute from his pocket and said , " We saved this little old baby just for you . " He handed thep105salute up to Father Ryan , then lifted his pine torch to the sill . Father Ryan held the fuse against the torch . It sizzled for a moment from dampness , then began to hiss . He felt again , remembered from boyhood , the incomparable thrill of time running out , of one 's having to act in haste and yet with perfect control . " Watch this ! " he shouted , and with all his strength he hurled the salute toward the chapel roof . It climbed up , up , up through the streaming dark , its fuse faintly spiraling , and then burst in a sheet of white flame over Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm , five minutes after the siren in the town hall had begun its keening , the smallest of the four barns was a yellow kettle of flames . It was still possible to see in the midst of the fire the outline of a burning truck . It was surmised that the old Ford , on being driven into the barn , had backfired , kindling its load of hay . Now , with , a roar , the fire was beginning to spread . More and more volunteer firemen kept arriving . The chief of the department was said to be shopping in Lakeville , and old Dr. Harley , who was eighty-nine , had not yet reported ; the rest of the men were happily sizing up the ground and looking for water . The pumper , which had been taking part in a parade in Canaan , arrived with flags and bunting and driven by a Pilgrim Father . Beside him , filling the valley with the clangor of the bell , sat a painted Indian . The nearest water lay high on the hill behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not make the grade . Francis Nolan , the plumber , took over the wheel . He was a black-haired Irishman , and he looked , as hep107sent the shining red-and-chromium chariot against the slope , like a god in armor , but the pumper remained unheroically mired . Francis swore . His curses echoed across the fields and among the trees . The firemen tugged and thrust against the wheels until the pumper began to rock ; then slowly it slid back and down the hill . Dick O'Brien , the grocer , still in his apron , with a pencil over his ear and a yellow pad in his pocket , began to pay out the hose . It would have to be carried up the hill by hand . In the meantime , as the crowd gathered , the smallest barn burned to its skeleton . Between the last of the flames and the charred timbers , the blue September sky opened in squares . Everyone was waiting for the gas in the truck to explode ; the explosion , when it finally came , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy with leaves , crashing in a woods . Then the timbers fell , wall by wall , laying themselves out precisely across the scorched ground . The owner of the farm , a man with one arm , did not seem concerned . He stood under a nearby tree , pointing out with seeming good humor to everyone who passed how clumsily the volunteers lifted the heavy hose . He held in his single hand a big silver watch , timing the destruction of the barns . The house was two hundred yards away , out of the direction of the wind , but , for double assurance , two farm hands were dousing the roof with water handed up to them in tin milking pails . Another barn caught fire . The flames were so high and strong that they swallowed the barn , with its stored-up hay , in one immense burst of fire , making bright loops of light through the loft , orange and yellow and white . One minute the roof was solid black shingle ; the next , it began to curl , and candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onep108wide , coppery blaze . The heat reached out to shred the leaves on branches twenty yards away . A rabbit darted from under the burning floor , his white tail bobbing . He wheeled , panting , at the feet of the crowd and stared at the burning barn , and then , as if he suddenly realized that home was where he wanted most to be , plunged back into the smoke . Everyone in town had heard the siren or had caught sight of the smoke lifting above the hills . Mrs. Abley , an elderly paralytic , had been driven over in her Cadillac to occupy a place in the front rank . The volunteers had to circle her car with the hose to reach the barns . A dozen young girls , in halters and shorts and dark glasses in spite of late September , paraded before incurious boys . One mother had brought her baby , wrapped in blankets . Dr. Hill , the distinguished surgeon from New York , went about picking up the late apples from under the trees in the orchard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hill . They straightened the hose into easy curves , set it free of kinks , and attached the wide nozzle . Twenty minutes had passed since the siren began . All three remainingbarns were by now smothered in smoke . Mr. Degnan , the butcher , his apron spotted with hamburger , his straw cuffs at his elbows , brushed back the hair that no longer grew on his bald scalp and directed two of the youngest volunteers to carry the hose first to the third barn and then to the fourth . There was now no hope of saving the second , which was shaking in readiness to fall . " It 's coming ! " The words , shouted from the top of the hill , fell in the clear air through the upland meadows , through the clover , through the orchard , and along the greenp109plateau . And then the water , as it poured down , began to quicken the hose . The white case turned and quivered under the firemen 's hands , and , finally , with a spurting kick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hiss , a black cloud that dirtied the sun , and the flames fell back . Ladders of every size and kind were brought forward . The volunteers mixed in confusion with the crowd and the ladders were set up , lifted away , and set up again . Boys picked up rocks and tossed them against the windows of the biggest barn so that the firemen could send the water into the loft and against the roof , but the draft made by the broken panes served only to feed the fire . This biggest barn was the pride of the town . It had been built in 1888 , and the date was worked into the slate roof and carved into one of the stones of the immense granite foundation . It bore geometric designs in the shingles of the side walls . It also had a cupola with stained-glass windows and a gilt cow weathervane . It held quarters for the farm hands as well as a loft for hay , stables for horses , and a wide basement for the cows . The horses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses galloping off , snorting , into the orchard , the cows staring back reproachfully , without alarm . The firemen soaked the walls of the barn till the steam rose and glittered in the sun . The third of the barns suddenly collapsed , the south wall falling outward over Tom O'Connell , the garageman . The square of timbers dropped about him , boxing the ground at his feet ; he leaped out over the blackened grass without a word , without turning his head . The crowd was beginning to get bored . The worst of the blaze seemed over and apparently the big barn was certainp110to be saved . The younger boys crawled up on the pumper , asking questions of Francis Nolan and hammering at the silver bell , and the girls in their halters began to shiver as the wind strengthened . Mrs. Abley was driven away . The mother carried her sleeping baby home to its crib . The owner of the farm stood alone , saying nothing , simply waiting . As the firemen worked on and as the flames continued to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real-estate dealer , was supposed to have said that she had only last week sold the farm to a couple from New York . That explained the calmness of the one-armed man . This couple was planning to move an old house from Winsted to a site by the pond at the top of the hill . Accordingto Mrs. Clennan , the couple would n't have minded losing the present house , because it was such a fright  --  early twentieth century and in very bad taste ; but their architect , who had been up to see the farm only yesterday , had fallen in love with the barns . He would be heartbroken . He had planned to make of them the most charming , the most delightfulEarly American group . Another rumor had it that the architect had intended to tear down the barns the very first thing , and now the couple from New York would be able to collect insurance on what they had wanted to get rid of . In these matters , the truth was always a long time in coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At seven o'clock only the firemen were left , still stubbornly washing down the walls with water , stamping out the little tongues of flame that were constantly spreading across the grass . At eight o'clock they wound up their hose . The job was done . They were not hungry  --  the fire had taken their appetitesaway . They talked for a minute or two about thep111fire , and then Francis Nolan climbed into the driver 's seat . The pumper churned , choked , and sputtered . Here in this meadow in the dark , with the ruins smoking behind them and their beds lying ten minutes ahead of them , they were out of gas . They walked in silence to the road to stop the first approaching car.  |p112The  Sunflower KidJustin Kelly stepped from the low doorway of the house into the yard . His wife called to him from the kitchen , " Where you going , Just ? " and without turning his head he answered , " I got to give Jimmy his walking papers . " The kerosene lantern in his hand threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was six o'clock on a cold October morning , and the grass through which Kelly walked was tipped with rime . Kelly crossed the yard , rolled aside the barn door , and stood motionless for a moment , listening . He could hear the stock impatiently rattling their stanchions in the cellar under his feet . A rat scampered across the loft ; dust sifted through a knothole . The loft was filled with hay , which gave heat and a sweet smell to the barn . Kelly walked through the harness room and knocked on a batten door in the far wall . " Jimmy ! " he shouted , then kicked at the door . " Up , you big ape ! " When Kelly opened the door , his shadow , cast by the lantern in his left hand , blotted out much of the little room . Kelly raised the lantern over his head . The room held onlyp113an iron cot , a chair , and a chest of drawers . The single high square window in one wall was sealed with newspapers . A tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay curled with his legs almost touching his chin . The light of the lantern gleamed on his blue cheekbones and open mouth . On the bare floor beside the bed were scattered four or five brightly colored comic books : Harry and Margie , The Goldnut Family , The King of Mars . Kelly yanked at the covers of the cot , and Jimmy opened his eyes , unseeing . He lay with his cropped head on the lumpy pillow . Gradually Kelly came into focus in the pools of Jimmy 's eyes . " Boss , " he said . Then his eyes widened , he was awake at last , and he swung his big feet onto the floor . He was dressed in long gray winter underwear and woolen socks . He got up and pulled on denim trousers and a soiled brown shirt . He shoved his feet into his shoes , not troubling to lace them . Whenever he got into trouble , his first ruse was to try playing the clown . He would be the dumb nigger who never did anything right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ai n't saying it 's past five ? " " Past six . " Towering over Kelly , Jimmy rolled his eyes and groaned . " After I went and promise to be careful ! " He bent down and fumbled under the pillow . His hand cupped an oldfashionedalarm clock with a bell and ringer fastened to its top . " The clock Mis ' Kelly give me . Set right for five . " Kelly said , " No use , Jimmy . I 've warned you fifty times . " Still playing the clown , Jimmy spoke with exaggerated slowness , doling out the words : " I must have reach out in my sleep and shut it off . I must have dream I was up and tending the cows and chickens and building a nice coal fire in the kitchen for Mis ' Kelly . "  | " I ca n't help that . Pack what 's yours and clear out . " " I only doing what Mis ' Kelly say . Like she say I got to read more . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeak on " do . " " I do read more . " Kelly stamped on the comic books . " Not her fault if you stay up all night reading junk like this . I 've warned you twenty times in the last three years . This time I mean it . I want you out of this room and off the farm by ten . " Jimmy took note that the number of times that Mr. Kelly claimed to have warned him had dropped from fifty to twenty . The change might be a sign . He was quick to read signs . " I 'm a good worker , " he said . " You know you wo n't find no better worker'n me . I belong on this farm . " " Young Polsky down the road has been after me for work all fall . I 'll drive over and pick him up before we leave for the fair . He knows the kind of work I expect . I 'm not like Carter , over Riverton way , who plays at farming . Who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need a man I can trust . " " And you ca n't trust Jimmy ? " " You see I ca n't , goddam it ! You 're big and you 're strong , but putting a head on you was a waste of time . " " I 'm a lazy good-for-nothing nigger , and that 's a fact . " It cost Jimmy no more to condemn himself than to praise himself ; the important thing was to keep Mr. Kelly talking . It had always worked before , but this time Kelly turned and walked through the harness room and out of the barn . The sun , not yet risen , was beginning to lighten the sky beyond the hills . It would be a fine day . Jimmy followed Kelly , carefully shutting the barn door behind him and picking up stray bits of paper as he crossed the yard . " You and Mis ' Kelly 'll have an awful nice time at thep115fair , " Jimmy said , as if nothing had happened between Kelly and him . Kelly stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your breakfast . Mrs. Kelly 's baking a cake , so keep your big hulk out of her way . " Kelly lifted the chimney of the lantern and blew out the little butterfly-winged tongue of flame . " We 'll be leaving the minute I get hold of Polsky . " " Mis ' Kelly and her cakes ! " Jimmy said . " She 'll be winning first prize till she 's a hundred ! You got your basket of Mclntoshes all shined up ? " " It 's a wonder , Jimmy , you do n't choke on all that crap . " " Sir ? " A foot higher than Kelly , Jimmy seemed to hang there against the sky . His breath was whiter than smoke in the still air . He was waiting for a sign , and it did n't come . " That hokum , that dumb-nigger crap . You 're broke , I suppose ? " " Yes , sir . " " I 'll pay you up to the end of the month , is that O.K. ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . Do n't throw it away like every other cent you ever had . " Then , in a voice less harsh but no less unforgiving : " Maybe you 'll amount to something , maybe you 'll do better somewhere else . Learn to stand up for yourself , once we stop coddling you . " " The thing is , Mr. Kelly , I been figuring to stay right here . I do n't want to do better somewhere else . " But Kelly had not heard him out . He had slammed the kitchen door shut without a word . There were times when it did no good to play the clown . Those were bad times , but the times afterward were worse : the times when there was nobody left to listen.  |p116Jimmy  was carrying feed to the chickens when he heard Mr. Kelly drive out of the yard . He crouched at one of the low windows of the coop and watched the little red pickup truck raising a cloud of dust along the lane . When the truck reached the state highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the Polsky place . Jimmy shook his head . He was beginning to feel sick to his stomach . He was hungry , and when he was hungry he felt sick , but this was a different feeling  --  it had more pain in it , and less ache . He had to milk the cows and turn them out to pasture , he had to put down fresh bedding for the horses , he had the stinking coop to clean . The feeling in his stomach was like the one he used to feel when he was a child , walking alone on a road at night , under big trees . They were trees full of goblins , and you could see the goblins ' faces grinning at you through the scary undersides of the leaves . Even when you did n't see them , the goblins were there . Someone was calling his name . It was Mrs. Kelly , and maybe she was bringing good news . She was nearly always on his side , and she might have talked Mr. Kelly out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen times . He clambered out of the coop and up a narrow flight of stairs to the first floor of the barn . Mrs. Kelly was waiting for him outside his bedroom door . She smiled and brushed back her thinning gray hair with one hand ; in the other hand was a bundle , neatly wrapped in brown paper . " Well , I heard , Jimmy , " she said , and went on smiling and fussing with her hair . " That 's all right , ma'am . " " I 'm sorry . " " Now , do n't go getting yourself upset . " A big  --  no , an enormous  --  idea had just entered his mind , and it pleasedp117him very much . " People , they keep saying , Jimmy , I want you to come and work for me , ' and all along I been saying , I like it fine just where I am . ' But lately it seems like the pestering 's been getting worse than ever . " He felt a moment of panic ; the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt up out of nowhere into his head and again the stream rushed and tumbled forward . " You know Mr. Carter over in Riverton ? Nicest farm around that town ! Well , he sweet-talk me into it . You be happier with a change , Jimmy , ' he said . You never stay in one place so long before . Time you made something of yourself . Time you got ahead in the world . ' " Mrs. Kelly said , " Time to get ahead in the world  --  that always sounds so lovely ! " She dipped her hand into a pocket in her apron and brought out a roll of bills . " This is your month 's pay , Jimmy . Mr. Kelly left it for you in five-dollar bills . He thought you 'd think twice before spending them if they were all in fives . Dollar bills , they just slip through your fingers . " She handed him the roll . " That 's a lot of money , Jimmy , " she said . " I 'll stick as tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mud . " Mrs. Kelly handed him the bundle , glancing as she did so at Jimmy 's soiled shirt . " A couple of old shirts of Mr. Kelly 's , " she said . " You 'd better put one on before you go to your new job . I 've packed two or three pairs of socks and a suit of long underwear , practically brand-new , that shrank too small in the waist for Mr. Kelly . And I wrapped up some cookies and a nice piece of store cheese in a wax paper inside the underwear . In case you get hungry . " " No more hungry for Jimmy , ma'am . I 'm on my way . " " Hungry ' reminds me  --  come along in and have yourp118breakfast . There 's a cake in the oven that I have to keep an eye on . " " I sure hope it wins you first prize , Mis ' Kelly . " " Jimmy , I declare ! " They both saw that the difficulty of saying a formal good-bye would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could feed him and lucky that he liked to be fed , Mrs. Kelly turned and started for the house and Jimmy followed her . Mrs. Kelly 's eggs and bacon  --  the Kellys ' own eggs , the Kellys ' own bacon  --  could n't be matched by any eggs and bacon in the whole wide world . After breakfast , cleaning out his room in the barn did n't take Jimmy long . He threw his old shirts and socks into the rusty wire incinerator behind the barn and put on his lumber jacket and fleece-lined leather cap . Sorting out on the cot his collection of comic books , he found that he had thirty-seven in all . He wrapped them up in a bundle and tied them with a stout length of string . The weight of the bundle would be a nuisance , and yet it made him proud . There was an awful lot of reading in that bundle . He drew on a pair of heavy gloves and feinted a few hard blows with them , like a boxer feinting as he waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish all his chores before he left , but Jimmy saw now that there would n't be time . What if Mr. Kelly were to come back with young Polsky when he , Jimmy , was still at work on the chicken coop ? Jimmy had no intention of encountering Polsky . He wanted the boy to think he had gone off in his own car , with a couple of big suitcases on the back seat . Besides , why would n't cleaning out the chicken coop be a fine job for Polsky to start on ? If he was n't used to the smell , it would make him good and sick . Jimmy grinned to think of Polsky scraping the chicken droppings off the wooden perches and shovelingp119them up off the concrete floor . All that greeny-gray shit ! Glory be ! The kid was in for a surprise . Jimmy had just started down the lane with a bundle under each arm when he saw the red truck turning in from the state highway . He ran back into the apple orchard and lay down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jimmy could see the Polsky boy sitting very straight on the seat beside Mr. Kelly . He was short , with yellowy hair and a pug nose . " Little old puny , " Jimmy said aloud . When the truck swung around in back of the house , Jimmy got up and ran along the lane to the highway . The sun was over the tops of the highest trees by now . Jimmy figured that it must be nearly eight o'clock . His shoes crunched in the soft gravel of the highway shoulders . He felt he could walk a thousand miles . No need to walk more than a few  --  the moment he told Mrs. Kelly the lie about Mr. Carter wanting him on his farm in Riverton , the proposition began to seem a reasonable one . It was as if he would n't have been able to think of it if it had n't been capable of being true . No two ways about it , the Carter farm was the place for him . A showplace , Mr. Kelly had called it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter there was always room on a farm for a good worker . Besides caring for the stock , he could mend walls , pour concrete , whitewash cellars , shingle roofs . He was as strong as any man he had ever met ; once , on a bet , he had lifted four eighty-pound sacks of cement , feeling his guts churn in his belly as he did so . Well ! He would ask Mr. Carter for a job , and Mr. Carter would say , " Jimmy , it 's a deal . " The sun was hot for October . After he had walked four or five miles along the Riverton road , Jimmy wanted to takep120off his lumber jacket , but because of the two bundles there was no way to carry it . He decided instead to walk more slowly . He counted his steps all the way up to a hundred , then started over again . He kept a finger bent for each hundred steps he walked . Once he had used up his ten fingers , he stopped counting . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming along the road behind him , but he knew that there was n't much chance of his being picked up , unless it was by somebody who thought he was still working for the Kellys . The cars that shot past him were driven by strangers . Even the farmers ' trucks looked as if they had come from a long ways off . Jimmy noticed that most of the trucks had a lot of children packed in among calves , chickens , and baskets of fruit , and finally it dawned on him  --  they were on their way to the fair ! He grinned and waved to them as they went by ; some of the children waved back and some of them thumbed their noses at him . At every step , Jimmy could feel rubbing against his leg the roll of bills in his trousers pocket . All fives ! Maybe after he got his job from Mr. Carter he would go on to the fair . He would give himself that little treat . He had never been able to go , since , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave Jimmy behind in charge of things . Jimmy imagined himself going into Riverton and buying himself a new suit of clothes for the fair . Then he imagined how he would stroll into the fairgrounds as free and easy as if he were the first selectman of Riverton , nodding right and left and saying a pleasant hello to all those strangers . He would make his way up to the front row in the tent where the judges were taking a bite or two out of Mrs. Kelly 's cake , or rolling a bit of crumb between their fingers , orp121even sticking their noses into the cake and sniffing it ( for Mrs. Kelly had told him that the smell of a cake was mighty important to judges ) , and Mrs. Kelly would see him there and her eyes would pop . She would n't be able to say much of anything because of the judges and the people watching , but she would be thinking that he had made a million dollars , all in one day . And then he would go into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apples . Mr. Kelly had told him that the judges used a magnifying glass  --  a magnifying glass !  --  to look for the least little blemish on those shiny Mclntoshes . Pretty soon Mr. Kelly would see him there among the judges , and then his eyes would pop . " What on earth are you doing here , Jimmy ? " Mr. Kelly would ask , and Jimmy would answer , " Happen I find myself free , Mr. Kelly . I thought I 'd just drop in and see how our little old apples is making out . " The expression that would come over Mr. Kelly 's face when Jimmy spoke of " our " little old apples ! Jimmy was delighted with the image he had conjured up . He thought hard about it in order to make himself forget the heat of the sun and the way his feet were beginning to hurt inside his shoes . When Jimmy reached the bridge that stood on the outskirts of Riverton , he turned right , off the highway . He followed a path down through some willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself on a dead log , he took off his gloves , lumber jacket , shoes , and socks . He wiggled his toes , then dipped them into the water . The water was much colder than he had expected and made his feet sting . Jimmy lifted his feet and rubbed them to bring the blood back to the surface . He glanced back and forth between his lumber jacket and the two bundles . If he was going to carry the lumber jacket , he would have to get ridp122of one of the bundles . Jimmy stared at the comic books tied with string and shook his head . He could n't let them go . He had been a couple . of years collecting that much reading . They were old friends by now  --  Maizie Spinach , Shultzie , and Emerina , blonde vixen daughter of the King of Mars . Jimmy opened the bundle that Mrs. Kelly had given him . In it were two white shirts , three pairs of socks , and a suit of long underwear . Wrapped in wax paper inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen cookies and a hunk of yellow cheese . That part of his problem was quickly solved . Jimmy swallowed the cookies and cheese in alternate bites . In five minutes the food was gone . He scooped up some river water in his hands and drank , to take away the heavy taste of the cheese . Then he sat down on the sand with his back against the log and thought . He felt sleepy , but he knew that there was n't time for sleep . By the end of half an hour , he had made a plan . He stood up and stripped off his trousers , soiled shirt , and old gray underwear . He would have liked to give himself a nice bath in the river , but the water was too cold . He was glad now that Mrs. Kelly had made him take a bath the week before . He drew on the long underwear that Mrs. Kelly had said was practically new . It felt prickly , the way new woolen underwear always did . If it had been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even smaller for Jimmy . Where it hurt him most was across his broad shoulders , so Jimmy picked up a sharp piece of stone and scratched a hole in the shoulder seams of the underwear . He tugged at the hole until he had widened it into a rip . That made the underweara lot more comfortable . Jimmy put on the three pairs of socks , one on top of the other . He put on both of thep123white shirts , leaving the collars unbuttoned . He had to wear his old denim trousers for the time being , but as soon as he got into Riverton he would be able to buy new ones . With the three pairs of socks on his feet , it was impossible to lace his shoes . He made up his mind to buy some new shoes in Riverton  --  shiny black ones with long pointed toes , of the sort that Mrs. Kelly had never let him buy . Jimmy piled his old shirt , socks , and underwear into Mrs. Kelly 's paper bundle and threw the bundle into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoelike object  --  downstream under the bridge and out of sight . Jimmy knew better than to try buying a suit in the best part of town . He avoided the main street of Riverton and followed the only other important street block after block until , where the town petered out into open fields , he came on a shop with a weather-beaten black-and-gold sign reading , GENTLEMEN'SFURNISHINGS . Over much of this sign had been hung a cheap canvas makeshift sign , which read , THRIFT SHOP . BUY HERE AND SAVE . To one corner of the canvas had recently been affixed a sheet of cardpaper , on which someone had crudely hand-lettered the words WELCOME , FAIRGOERS ! PRICES SLASHED . In the open air on either side of the doorwayto the shop , scores of suits and overcoats hung on galvanized-iron racks . As Jimmy walked up and down in front of the racks , hoping to attract attention without demandingit , an old man shuffled into the doorway . He seemed dazed by the sun . He raised both hands to screen his eyes from it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a cigar between the fingers of one hand . " Just looking or looking ? " he asked . " Looking , " Jimmy said.  | " You 're outsize , " the old man said , in an accusing voice . This remark was followed by a spell of coughing and spitting , through all of which he took pains not to lose the long ash of his cigar . " Outsize , " he said at last , catching his breath , " is not so easy . " The old man riffled along the cuffs of the jackets of the suits , reading the price tags . He hoisted from among its fellows on the rack a suit of brightgreentweed . " A lovely , " the man said , turning it about in the sun . The suit seemed to blaze there , like green fire . " Boston cut . You like it ? " Jimmy nodded . Of course he liked it ; he had never seen such a beautiful suit . Within fifteen minutes , after little bargaining , Jimmy had bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the shop . He had also bought a silk necktie and a pair of shoes that were every bit as black and sharp of toe as he had longed to have them be . His roll of bills might be terribly reduced  --  when the old man totted up the cost of the three items , Jimmy felt his heart contract  --  but the results were worth it . Staring at his reflection in the triple full-length mirror inside the shop , Jimmy reasoned that he had not thrown away a penny of his precious money . On the contrary , he had made a good investment . He took off one of Mr. Kelly 's shirts and , buttoning up the collar of the remaining one , put on his new necktie . He could not get enough of staring at himself ; he flexed his elbows and knees , he bowed and smiled at his three selves . He felt transformed . There would be no more clowning Jimmy now . He was a big man in a green suit and black shoes , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was what the old man had called him , and outsize was what he planned to be . The old man fitted Jimmy 's extra clothing and his bundlep125of comic books into a neat cardboard box . This was perhaps to be the old man 's one transaction of the day . He had put out a sign welcoming fairgoers , but none were likely to come by  --  the direct route to the fairgrounds lay on the other side of town . The sale had put the old man in a good mood . He was sorry that the suit was too small and would give poor wear , but his conscience was clear : it was the largest size he had in stock . " On your way to the fair ? " he asked Jimmy . " Yeah , but first I got to see a Mr. Carter about my new job . " " Carter that owns the big farm out east ? " " That 's him . Where I 'm going to be . " He was too proud  --  oh , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too proud !  --  to seek directions . " Coming into town , seems I got myself turned round , " he said . " The Carter place . . . " He stood hesitating on the threshold , ready to turn either left or right ; it was like him in his transformation to be able to learn things without having to ask . " Straight out of town a good four miles . Last place on your left before you get to the fair . Fairgrounds is one of the old Carter meadows . In this town it 's all in the family , and the family it 's all in is Carter . " The old man coughed and spat and drew happily on his cigar . That was one of his favorite jokes ; it had lasted him a lifetime . " See you later , " he said to Jimmy , waving him good-bye . " Have n't missed a fair since I was ten . Danbury is n't a patch on what we got up here . " Jimmy stopped to rest at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of the valley that lay in front of him were scattered five or six farms . Beyond the last of the white farmhouses , through the blue haze thatp126hung over the valley , Jimmy could make out a Ferris wheel slowly turning , turning . The sun winked and glinted on its swaying gondolas . A crazy quilt of colored tents and sheds lay all round the base of the wheel . The road along the valley was filling up with cars and trucks . Jimmy lay back against the trunk of an oak tree and caught his breath . It was hard work walking in a new suit and new shoes , but it was worth it . Almost everyone who had driven by him had turned and stared , and some of them had waved . The Kellys in their little red truck had driven past him without recognizing him , and that had pleased him more than anything . A car pulled off the road onto the green knoll where Jimmy was resting . For several minutes after the driver had turned off the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old horse clearing its head and chest after a long uphill pull . The car was evidently very old ; it was much higher than an ordinary car , and above the open back seat rose a ten-foot-high plastic figure of a woman . Or , rather , it was a figure of two women , one inside the other ; the bigger woman was outlined by red neon tubes , and the smaller one by blue , and the face of the woman in red was frowning , while the face of the woman in blue wore a sultry smile not unlike that of Emerina , daughter of the King of Mars . Jimmy picked up his jacket and cardboard box and strolled across to the car . Seated behind the wheel , the driver had just started eating his lunch out of a paper bag . He was wearing a large white sombrero , a white leather vest , and high white leather boots . He had a white beard and the brightest blue eyes that Jimmy had ever seen . " Hi , there , cowboy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Cowboy ! What you use for eyes ? "  | " Do n't get your Dutch up , cowboy . I 'm not a cowboy either . " Adroitly , he kicked open the right front door of the car with the heel of his boot . " Like a lift to the fair ? " " I got to stop off first at a farm down there . But I could use a lift . My feet 's burned up . " " Climb in , cowboy . Dump it right there . The name 's Buckley . " " Sir ? " " William H. K. Buckley , D.M.M. " Jimmy had never heard anyone speak so fast ; the words sputtered and popped . " Sir ? " he asked again . " Doctor of Medical Mineralogy . A little specialty of mine . " Jimmy scrambled up onto the high front seat of the car , placing his jacket and the cardboard box carefully beside him . " Split a sandwich with me , " Buckley said , reaching into the bag , fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts , paper wrapping and all . " Tuna fish , " he said . " Nothing like the natural oils of the tuna to keep the lower bowels well lubricated . " He bit heartily into the sandwich , and , with his mouth full , urged Jimmy by repeated nudges and winks of the eye to do likewise . Buckley was ready to talk again when his mouth was scarcely half-empty ; bits of bread and tuna flew through the air as he spoke . " I sell a product , " Buckley said , " that is guaranteed to take ten pounds of blubber a week off any man , woman , or child in the country . That 's where mineralogy comes in . Mineralogy means stone , or the next thing to it , and my product is ninety-five per cent water and five per cent crushed limestone . You drink my product , cowboy , you 're drinking stone ! No wonder the fat falls off ! " Buckley reached into the paper bag and brought out an orange , which , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers , giving a half to Jimmy and plunging the other half into his mouth . A few moments later , he was ready to continue ; flecks of orange dotted the windshield . " Before I got into calories , I used to be in oils . That 's how I learned about tuna and the like of that . Christ , I used to scare people half to death , talking about their lower bowel . Diet is the big pitch nowadays . I sell this little product here "  --  he handed Jimmy a bottle out of the glove compartment of the car  --  " that costs a dollar a pint . Deadliest appetite killer known to medical science . One spoonful of this and you want to spit on your food ! Take a look at the rig over the back seat . " Jimmy turned his head as Buckley flipped a switch on the dashboard . The bigger of the two female forms was outlined in flamingneon . " I call her Fatty , " Buckley said . He flipped a second switch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon , appeared the smaller form . " I call her Slim , " Buckley said . A third switch , and an electric sign over Fatty and Slim began to blink the message , FAT-OFF , FATOFF , FAT-OFF . " Before and after , " Buckley said . " Testimonials from coast to coast . Potbellies pour off the fatties like grease off a skillet . Not that you need it , but would you care to try a bottle ? " Jimmy said he would be glad to . It was the least he could do by way of thanking Dr. Buckley for his share of the lunch . Lifting his jacket from the seat , he took care that Dr. Buckley should catch sight of the roll that he drew from the pocket of the jacket . He had only twelve dollars left , but the amount was in one-dollar bills , and he fluffed them out as much as he could . Without haste , he peeled a dollar bill from the top of the roll , then slippedp129the roll back into the pocket of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of Fat-Off to somebody at the Carter place ; he certainly did n't want to take any medicine that would kill his appetite . " Why , good Lord , I meant to let you have it as a gift , " Buckley said , tucking the dollar into his vest . He started the engine and swung the big old car back toward the road . Jimmy could hear the plastic figures of Fatty and Slim squeaking above the back seat as the car cleared the ditch at the edge of the shoulder . " You got quite a roll there , cowboy , " Buckley said , keeping his eyes on the road . Jimmy leaned back against the seat , grinning . If there was anything he was sure of , it was that this was the happiest day of his life . Here he was , in his new green suit and black shoes , riding along in a big open car with a doctor who would give you the shirt off his back . You could tell by the expression in the doctor 's bright-blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why not ? Driving around the countryside , heading from one fair to the next , maybe going South in winter  --  Glory be ! Some people had all the fun ! Jimmy wished that Mr. and Mrs. Kelly had not already gone on ahead to the fair . He would have liked to have them drive up alongside Dr. Buckley 's wonderful car so he could wave to them . " Yeah , I got me a pocketful , " Jimmy said . He could not resist adding , in a casual voice , " They mostly fives . " The road had begun to level out along the valley floor . Jimmy could make out the top of a bandstand in the fairgrounds ; it vanished at a bend in the road , and Jimmy sat forward to catch his first glimpse of Mr. Carter 's farm . At that moment , Dr. Buckley swung the car over ontop130the shoulder , angrily hammering the steering wheel with his fist . " Now , goddam it to hell ! " he said , thrusting the sombrero back off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Irish ! I could feel it jumping right out of my hands . " " You got yourself a flat ? " " Take a look at that left rear tire , will you , cowboy ? " Jimmy jumped down from the car and examined the left rear tire . It looked sufficiently full of air to him , and it felt hard to the pointed toe of his shoe . Jimmy crouched to look under the car , and a blast of hot , suffocating air shot without warning from the rusty exhaust pipe . Jimmy choked , trying not to swallow . The tires of the old car spun savagely on the shoulder , throwing gravel up into his eyes . He fell back on his hands , shouting . By the time he had scrambled to his feet , the big car was two or three hundred yards down the road , weaving wildly in and out of traffic . A few seconds later , it had vanished behind a grove of maples . Jimmy shouted , " You got my coat ! You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You got my money ! You got my money ! " Though he knew it was hopeless , he started running after the vanished car . What else was there to do but run ? Shouting was hopeless , too , but he would have kept on shouting if he could . He had no breath left for it ; after the first five minutes , he was too exhausted to run . His heart was hammering not in his chest alone , but , so it seemed , everywhere in his body . He could feel it hammering in his ears , his mouth , the back of his head . His new green trousers had cut welts across his thighs ; his feet were afire inside the new shoes . He stood as close as he dared to the stream of traffic , trying to make one among all those cars stop and pick him up . He called out to them , but they could not hear his words ; nor couldp131he hear theirs when they called back , though by their gestures he could tell that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was unable to run , he was scarcely able to walk . He felt his eyes stinging with dust and sweat . The once cold October-morning air had turned unexpectedly hot and close . It was like midsummer . Jimmy noticed an ample white farmhouse standing on a rise across the road . Before he could read the name lettered on the tin mailbox , he knew whose house it would prove to be . Carter 's place , where he had been going to get his lovely job . Jimmy blinked , only half seeing the big house , the long red barns , the blue metal silos . The showplace . The truth was that there would never have been a job for him there , never in a million years , but he would have asked . Now it was no matter . The job  --  any job  --  would have to wait . He had to reach the fairgrounds and get back his money and jacket and bundle of comic books . Jimmy walked on in pain past the Carter farm . He could hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music seemed to come out of the trees in front of him . Jimmy bent down and took off his shoes . There was blood on his socks , blood smeared on the inner lining of his shoes . The soles of his feet were too sore to touch . The people in the cars and trucks that sped past , catching sight of him in socks and holding his shiny new shoes in his hand , laughed and pointed him out to others . He rounded a fringe of woods and there , filling a thirty-acre meadow , was the fair . The crowd at the fair was much bigger than Jimmy had anticipated . It was going to be a hard job finding anyone in such a mob . He would have to look for Dr. Buckley 's car and for FAT-OFF winking on and off above it . A highp132wire fence surrounded the fairgrounds . Scores of cattle and sheep were lined up inside the fence , waiting to be judged . He saw their owners standing watch over them , polishing the brass tips of the cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of the six big tents in the fairgrounds had a sign hanging over the entrance flap ; he could see one that said CHICKENS , another that said PRODUCE . Jimmy followed the line of the fence until he reached the entrance gate . There were wooden booths on each side of the gate , and signs in the barred windows of the booths said ADMISSIONFIFTY CENTS . EXHIBITORS ADMITTED FREE . A tall manwith a badge was standing between the booths , watching the double line of people edging slowly through the gate . Jimmy felt uselessly in his pockets for money . He stood there without moving , letting people brush against him or try to jostle him out of their way . He walked up to the man with the badge , holding his shoes behind him ; that way , the man might not notice that he was in his stockinged feet . " Excuse me , Officer , " he said . " ' I just been robbed . " The man with the badge kept his eyes on the crowd . " Sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , sir . " " You mean you 're not sure ? " " No , I am sure . " " Happen to know the name of the fellow you claim robbed you ? " " Buckley . " " Doc Buckley ? " " Yeah , him , that 's the one ! He pick me up in his car and then he rob me . Took my money and my new coat and a bundle of reading I got . " " Doc 's been coming here for years . " For the first time , the man looked straight into Jimmy 's eyes . " Very well likedp133around here , Doc is . If you do n't want those pretty white teeth of yours knocked down your throat , better not tell anyone else what you told me . " " He took everything I got . And just drove off . " " On your way , sonny-boy . I got a job to do . " " I want my money . " The man with the badge glanced down then at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze on the crowd and brought the heel of a shoe down on top of one of Jimmy 's feet and twisted the heel back and forth and , still smiling , said , " Now , beat it . I 've had just about enough from you . " Jimmy turned and limped up the road beyond the gate . He felt pain flooding up and down the length of his leg  --  new pain raging all round and through the old . Inside the fence stood a long canvas booth with netting down each side and across the back . A man in dirty chinos and a checkered cap was standing behind the booth , pouring himself a drink . He caught sight of Jimmy as he threw back his head to swallow . Holding the bottle in one hand , he walked over to the fence . " Want to see the fair ? " he said . " Want to get in without spending four bits ? " Jimmy nodded . " I 'll give you a job , " the man said . " Two bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger I had ran off last night . A nice , easy nigger job . All you got to do is use your head . " " Meaning what ? " " Meaning ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies . If you can use the money , I 'll pass you in . " The man was smiling , and his smile meant something that Jimmy could n't understand . He said , " No , thanks . There 's something else I got to do . " Jimmy followed the fence along the road to where itp134turned at right angles and ran across the narrow end of the meadow . The fence led him through a tangle of mountain laurel and hardhack , but he was still in sight of the gate ; he could see the head and shoulders of the man with the badge . Finally , he reached the river . The fence paralleled the bank of the river for several hundred yards . It was useless to try and climb it there , because a number of picnickers were seated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence had been opened where the river broadened and grew shallow , but farmers were standing there wateringtheir oxen and horses ; there was no hope of sneaking past them unnoticed into the fairgrounds . Jimmy fastened the laces of his shoes together and hung them around his neck . He rolled up his green tweed trouser legs and started wading across the shallow part of the river . The water was icy . Twice he slipped over boulders , bruising his fingers as he caught himself . He sat down on a boulder in the middle of the river to get back his strength . Floating on a waterloggedbranch below him was a pair of faded denim trousers . Jimmy rubbed his palms against his thighs . He knew the feeling of those old pants well enough . Caught in the twigs of the branch were the soaked , many-colored pages of a comic book . As Jimmy watched , the branch turned over in the current and was swept away . Another comic book lay in the black mud along the riverbank . Jimmy swallowed . He climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the fence with both hands . He saw a few feet beyond him a place where the bank dropped away under the wire mesh of the fence . Dogs had made a hard , regular track there , and the track led on into waist-high laurel on the far side of the fence . Jimmy crawled to the opening and squeezed himself on his bellyp135between the bank and the fence . He had always been so proud of how strong he was , and now he felt so weak , so weak . Once he had got inside the fence , he lay face down on his hands and caught his breath . In a minute or two , he sat up and put on his shoes and rolled down his trousers . He got to his feet and walked quickly out of the laurel into the crowd . Anyone seeing him might have supposed that he had been relieving himself in the bushes ; no harm in that . But no one had seen him . He was safe . Jimmy walked through the fairgrounds , keeping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen was taking place in a wide dirt pit beyond the bandstand . A yoke of oxen was tugging at a wooden boat filled with roughly squared-off chunks of granite . A sign at one side of the pit said PRESENT LOAD , 4450 POUNDS . A farmer was cutting the oxen across the flanks with a long thin whip and cursing them . Farther on , a man and a woman in silver tights were roller-skating on a platform high above the crowd . Jimmy had almost reached the gate when he caught sight of Buckley . He was standing on a little stage in front of his car , with bright-red Fatty shining behind him . Jimmy stopped on the outer edge of the crowd that had gathered around Buckley . " I ask you , " he was saying , " who would be Fatty if she could be Slim ? " He pressed a switch in his hand and Fatty went dark as Slim came flickering on in saucy blue neon curves . " You ask what makes you fat , ladies and gentlemen ? Simple enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what kills appetite ? Fat-Off ! A harmless product of Mother Nature . Successfully recommended by this physician a thousand times , in a practice extending from coast to coast . Never lost a thin patient ! Never kept a fat one ! Try your sample bottle of Fat-Offp136today ! Thank you , ma'am ! Thank you , sir ! " The crowd shifted and began to move away as Buckley hopped down off his little stage and began a lively bottle-by-bottle sale to the latest group of Fat-Off converts . Jimmy edged closer and closer . Buckley looked up from making a sale and saw Jimmy standing there . His bright-blue eyes went blank . " That 'll be one dollar , " he said , holding out a bottle . Jimmy said , " I got to have my money . " " Get lost , cowboy , " Buckley said . " You thought I had a big roll , " Jimmy said , " and they was n't anything but ones . Twelve bucks , Mister ! You just ca n't steal that little from a nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , sharply . Jimmy saw the man at the gate turn and look toward Buckley , who jerked a thumb in Jimmy 's direction . The man started away from the gate , and now he , too , was whistling . Jimmy ducked his head between his shoulders and ran . He tried making a zigzag half circle through the fairgrounds  --  with his blistered feet , he knew he could never outdistance them running in a straight line . Besides , he was in a cage , so straight lines were dangerous ; the meadow was fenced , and there was only the entrance gate and that one break in the fence by the river , too far away for him to reach undiscovered . Running head down , he found himself in front of the long canvas booth with the netting down the sides . He had almost stumbled over the legs of the man with the checkered cap , who was sitting sprawled in front of the booth with his eyes closed . An empty bottle lay on the counter . Jimmy could smell fear coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shook the man by the shoulder and said , " Mister ! I want that job ! " The man opened his eyes . He was drunk and contentp137and no longer in a hurry to make a deal . " You got yourself in trouble , black boy ? " he asked . " I got to get out of this crowd . Give me the job . " " Getting so late , would n't be worth more than a dollar an hour to me now . " " You say , " Jimmy said . The man stood up , steadying himself against the counter , and led Jimmy down the side of the booth . A narrow flap hung open at the end of the booth . Jimmy and the man stepped under the flap . In front of Jimmy was a wall of padded canvas with a round hole in the middle . There were two worn leather grips on each side of the hole . The man said , " All you got to do is stick your head through the hole . You can grab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll look for you here . These hicks 'll try to bounce some imitation baseballs off your head . Most of the time they 'll miss . The balls are a little tough , but they wo n't kill you . " Jimmy hesitated , and the man started to turn away . " It 's you who 're in trouble , smart ass , not me . " " All right . " Jimmy stuck his head through the hole in the padded canvas . The front of the canvas was painted with broad yellow petals radiating from the hole . Jimmy took the two leather grips and stared straight ahead . It was hard to keep his head up ; the starchy canvas at the top of the hole cut into the back of his neck . The man in the checkered cap was setting out rows of balls on the counter at the front of the booth . When . he finished setting out the balls , he picked up a megaphone and in a high flat voice started shouting , " Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid smack on the old bean !  |p138Three  balls for a quarter ! Test your aim ! Test your skill ! Try out that old baseball arm ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Hurry ! " Jimmy felt the sweat pouring down his face . He could taste the salt of it on his lips . A couple of men sidled up and dropped quarters onto the counter . The bigger of the two men threw the first ball . It struck the padded canvas a yard over Jimmy 's head . Then the big man threw two more . They both missed Jimmy 's head . " Goddam ! " the big man said . " But I 'm gaining on it . " The other man threw his three balls easily , taking careful aim . The third ball hit Jimmy on the forehead . Jimmy flinched , feeling the sting of the leather against his skin . The big man dropped another quarter on the counter . " By God , if it takes me all day , " he said . The man with the cap shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's pretty good ! Ca n't even clip the Sunflower Kid ! Ca n't even get close ! Ca n't throw ' em hard enough ! Step right up and test your skill ! Three for a quarter ! " The big man threw the first two balls very hard and fast . The man beside him said , " Take it easy , Carter . Do n't try to kill the guy . " Carter , Jimmy thought . He saw the big man throw the third ball , and he saw the ball coming at him . He ducked his head . No use . The ball smacked against the side of his head , along his cheek . The skin was cut . Jimmy could feel the blood against his cheek , and the air cooling his blood . Jimmy could hear Carter saying , " By God , I hit him ! I really got the son of a bitch ! " The two men walked away , laughing . Jimmy shook his head , trying to keep the sweat out of his eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the booth . They glanced at him for a moment , then glanced away . They were swallowed up in the crowd . Jimmy ducked as three boys started throwing balls at him . The balls thudded into the canvas all round him . Two of them struck him on the top of his head . His hands gripped the worn handles . His knees were shaking so hard that he could n't stand . He slumped against the canvas . A lot of people were coming out of the exhibition tents beyond the booth . The judging was over , Jimmy guessed ; the people would be wanting to have some fun . The faces in the crowd grew blurred . Out of the blur emerged a face he recognized ; it was the face of the old man at the store in Riverton . He was running a skinny white hand over his face and smiling . He placed his cigar carefully on the edge of the counter and picked up a ball . Jimmy tried to keep his eyes focused on the man , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls struck him in succession . Jimmy hung against the canvas . A voice he knew cried , " Just ! " Jimmy tried to call to Mrs. Kelly , but his voice was gone . Besides , the canvas was pressed against his throat ; he could scarcely breathe . Then he heard two voices outside the back of the booth . One of the voices belonged to the man with the checkered cap , and the other voice was Mr. Kelly 's , and they were arguing about money , Then the talking stopped . Jimmy hung against the canvas and waited . There were so many things to ask , if only everything did n't hurt so much . He had to be sure to ask Mrs. Kelly about her cake . That was one thing . And there was something else , if he could remember it . He felt somebody lifting him under the arms , and he stumbled across the field with someone'sp140arm across his back . At first he could see only the trampled grass under his feet ; then he saw the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailgate rattling down . The bed of the truck held a few inches of hay , covered by a tarpaulin . He lay on the tarpaulin , drawing his legs up close to his chin . He could hear the Kellys talking on the front seat of the truck . " If we drop him off at the hospital , " Mr. Kelly said , " they 'll patch him up , and in a day or two he can be on his way . If we take him home , we 'll never get rid of him . " " But , Just  --  " " I know . Goddam it , I know ! I 'm taking him home . " They were wrong . He was too weak to tell them , but they were wrong . He was n't that Jimmy  --  their Jimmy  --  any more . He would rather have gone to the hospital than back to the farm . As soon as he was well enough , he 'd light out so fast they 'd think he flew . They had n't seen what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the store at Riverton , bowing and smiling . The truck started out of the fairgrounds , and at every bump his body hurt anew . A smell of apples came up out of the hay . That was the other thing he would have to remember to speak of . Mr. Kelly 's apples . He felt himself slipping into space . He felt a darknessclosing over him . Nobody had to worry about him any more . He was so full of pain and so content . For a while there , he had thought it the happiest day of his life , and maybe it would be , maybe it was.  |p141My  earliest memory is of my father becoming an old man . He and I are in a room I have never seen before . It has varnished matchwood walls and a wooden ceiling , and from a pole in a doorway hangs a portiere of iridescent sea shells . The room is cold and smells of damp . My father goes about opening windows to let in the fresh summer air . The sashes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he strikes the frames again and again with his plump fists . Once the windows are up , a breeze from the Sound makes the shells on their knotted cords rustle dryly together , and I run to part them . I want to be first to see what is on the other side . But it is a jumble of shadows , and for a moment I hold back , my fingers among the shells . " Go ahead , Tim , " says my father . " There 's nothing there . " His saying it has put something there , and I choose a shell and spin it round and round on its cord , as if that were what I had run across the room to do . My father stands at one of the windows , the sky behind him , his face a blur . I make out the top of his pink bald scalp and the fringe of curling gray hair above his ears.  | " Go on , " he says . " It 's just a room . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . What are you afraid of ? " Round and round goes the pearly shell . " Not afraid . " " A big boy like you ! " It is still daylight outside , but the room is darkening . My father 's body seems to swell and swell against the window . Kate and my mother are unpacking the car and piling luggage by the locked back door . Because I am younger than Kate and have behaved so well on the long trip from home , I have been given the treat of entering the house alone with my father . " There 's something there . " " Now , Tim , " says my father . " We wo n't have any of that , will we ? " " There is . I saw it . " " Do n't lie . " " I 'm not . I really did see something . " " A bear ? A witch ? A goblin ? " " Something . " " Cowards and liars , " says my father , " are the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn that , the better . " I remember how he came smiling across the room at me then , getting bigger and bigger until everything else in the room was blotted out . He picked me up under the arms and thrust me face forward through the shells . My back was pressed against his fat belly and I tried to hit him across the face , but my arms would n't bend right . I kept hitting air , and he kept laughing and lifting me higher and higher into the shadows and saying , " Nothing , see ? Nothing ! Nothing ! " At last I hit him , and he stumbled and let me go . I fellp143sidewise into a shadow that was more than a shadow . It was a table , and I struck the edge of it above my eye and burst out crying . My father bent down in the dark , groping for me with outstretched hands , then picked me up and carried me into the other room . He sat in a wicker rocker and bounced me on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said in a loud voice , " No , boy , no ! It 's all right . Do n't yell . " But I went on yelling , partly because my forehead hurt and I was uncomfortable in his lap , and partly because I wanted Mother and Kate to find me there , with him to blame for my misery . Sure enough , in a moment they hurried up the front steps and into the dusky room . Mother took me away from him , and as soon as she had tucked my head into the safe place between her neck and shoulder , I stopped yelling . " Poor baby ! " she said , marching up and down the room and swaying under the weight of me . " What happened to my baby ? " " An accident , but he 'll live , " said my father . " He knocked his head against something in the dining room . " Mother held me away from her . " Look at that bump ! " she cried . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a bump ! " Then she hugged me closer than before , and the thought of how my skin might have broken and the blood gushed over everything made more tears come . I squeezed them out against her soft white neck . Kate danced about Mother and him and me and said , " What do you mean , accident ? What kind of accident ? How come ? " " Now , now ! Water over the dam , " said my father . " Let 's finish opening the house before dark . Those windows were the devil . " " Only , it was n't an accident , " I said.  |p144Kate  could always guess when I had more to say . She tugged at my feet in the folds of Mother 's skirt and said , " What was n't , Timmy ? Tell me what ! " They were waiting for me to speak . I held the words in for as long as I could , and when I could n't hold them in any longer , I said , " He dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was ready to be angry with him then and there . It took her no time at all to get angry , or to get over being angry . " What on earth were you doing with my Bumpo ? " He was hoping to catch my eye , but I would n't look at him . " We needed some light in there , " he said , ducking his head toward the portiere of shells . " God knows where the lights are in this old dump . " " There 's only gas , " Mother said . " The agent told us that in March . They have n't run the electric wires to this end of the beach yet . We thought it would n't matter . " I did n't want Mother drifting off onto that subject , and I moaned a little into her neck and brought her round . She crossed to the doorway and , parting strands of amber shells , peered into the room . " You sent poor Tim in there alone ? " she asked him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's you who 've taught him to hate it , if he does , " my father said . " You 're worse than any child about the dark . " He was still trying to catch my eye , but I would n't let him , and he said , " We both went in there . I was holding him up to see if he could find a light , and he fell . " " He said you dropped him . " " I say he fell . " " Phil , Phil ! You 're always so hard on them . " " Hard ! " he said . " They 're spoiled from morning to night , and you know it . "  |p145He  had n't told Mother the truth , and I was n't going to tell her the truth either . I wanted her out of it , so that whatever was going to happen would be only his and mine . I said to Mother , " Let me down . " She would have held me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her body and said , " No ! Let me down ! " She opened her arms and I slid out of them to the floor . I said to Kate , " Look at Daddy 's hands . What he did to them . " " Poor Daddy ! " Kate said . She ran to him and patted his reddened hands . He stared at me over Kate 's head , wondering what I would say next , and I stared back . " Poor Phil ! " Mother said , her voice like Kate 's . My leavingher had made her give up being angry with him . " You do rush into things so ! We 'll be here all summer . There 's no need to kill yourself . " " The windows had to be opened , " he said . " The house was a grave . " " Darling , how awful you make it sound ! I think it 's a very nice house . " " I love it , " Kate said . " Love it , love it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate had forgiven him , but he could n't make out whether I had forgiven him . " Tim , " he said , " what about helping me get the back door unlocked ? And a fire going in the kitchen stove ? " If I agreed to help him , I would seem to be forgiving him , but if I did n't agree to help him , he might ask Kate instead . I said , " All right , " thinking of " All right " as weaker than " Yes . " He reached out to touch me , and for a moment I let his hand rest on my head . Then I asked him , " Which way 's the kitchen ? " He nodded toward the portiere . " That way . " " All right , " I said again , and plunged through the shells.  |p146The  shadows on the other side were deeper now than ever . From their darkness , I looked out through the rocking and rustling shells into the twilight of the room I had left . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not see me . My father called to me to be careful , and when I failed to answer , he said sharply , his voice rising , " Tim ! Where are you ? " I called back to him out of the shadows , " Here ! What are you waiting for ? Come on ! , " and at last he came toward me , but how slowly , holding one hand before his face , like an old man afraid of getting hurt.  |p147In  any organization above a certain size , whether it be a pension-planning company of the sort I work for here on Fifth Avenue , or a law firm down on the Street , or an architects ' collaborative out in Westchester , if the sample contains a minimum of from fifty to a hundred people , it is safe to predict that among that number will be found at least one specimen of what I call the classic loser . Now , the proportion of classic losers to be found in the population as a whole is , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken pains to screen out every loser , classic or otherwise , so the presence of even a single specimen is a cause for wonder to the other employees and a greater cause for chagrin to management . Nevertheless , in my experience no organization has ever succeeded in reaching the statistical goal of what we may call zero losers . Why should this baffling situation arise and why does it remain an insoluble problem ? The question is well worth asking in the light of the fact that the classic loser will stand out with such a vividness of unsuitability that one would expect him  --  or , though far more rarely , her  --  to be rejected by Personnelp148the very moment he steps across the threshold . What are the powers-that-be thinking of when they hire such an obvious misfit ? Or are they simply not thinking ? The answer , I believe , is that they are indeed thinking , but that the classic loser has the power to alter people 's thought against their will . His sorry demeanor and the evidence , readily vouchsafed by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an uncanny fashion , his credentials ; he is accepted not because he is desirable , but because he is , for the time being , irresistible . He parades his naked weakness as if it were a kind of armed strength . The display of old wounds amounts to a method of hypnosis , in the presence of which the skills acquired in a lifetime of coolly assessing one 's fellows are suddenly rendered trifling . Personnel , so quick to expose the hidden places in the lives of ordinary candidates for jobs , stares with fascination upon the sad man without secrets . I mentioned that the classic loser is irresistible for the time being , and this is because it is in the nature of the hypnotic state that it cannotcontinue indefinitely ; still , for as long as it does so , what a menace it represents to any well-knit group ! For the role of the loser is precisely the reverse of the ancient role of the scapegoat , upon whom once a year the sins of the tribe were ritually heaped and the scapegoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loser , it is not the sins of the many that are concentrated upon him , but his sins that are scattered among the many . He poisons the once healthy air and diminishes the energies of the entire establishment . He will move on at last  --  the classic loser always moves on at last , in effect choosing to sacrifice the tribe he has adopted before the tribe has found any adequate means of sacrificing him  --  but the infection he leaves behind will in nearly every instance require many years to purge.  |p149Of  the handful of losers I have encountered in the course of my long career with this organization , most have moved in and out of our highly efficient little whirlpool with a merciful speed , vanishing after a while as if they had been so much mere soiled and ineffectual foam . But they were not foam , or not altogether , and it is sometimes the case that long after their departure an obituary of one or another of them will appear in the New York Times  --  an obituary whose importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's connection with our firm . It may turn out that few of us who read the obituary will be able to remember a word that the dead man spoke , or even perhaps what he looked like : was he the hawk-faced little man who used to flatten himself like the crushed corpse of a crow against the wall of a corridor when anyone passed him , though the corridor was wide enough for two big men to pass in comfort ? Or was he the sour blond boy who spent much of the day in a nearby bar , writing his calculationsin cramped wheels of equations along the circumferenceof innumerable cardboard beer coasters , which he would gather up at nightfall and deposit in the catch basin at the corner of Fifty-seventh Street and Fifth Avenue ? ( We had assumed of the blond boy that he was out interviewing clients ; his stay with us was , for a loser , unusually brief . ) Scores and hundreds of faces pass in an office and blur in memory , and the names affixed to them are blotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other , it is because it was a portion of the only genius he possessed to make me feel guilty for disliking him . It was a guilt I had no reason to feel  --  had I not the right to dislike a dislikableman ?  --  and yet I go on unreasonably feeling it to this day . I perceive that even writing about him now , so long after his death , will not lessen my guilt . He has mep150locked in an embrace that nothing as simple as his death or the passage of time can release me from . It was his gift to gather a person in against the person 's will and then never let go ; I will try to tell the truth about the Loser , but not in the hope that I can slough him off at last . He was lame . One had to feel sympathy for him because of that inescapable burden , and it did n't occur to any of us in the organization not to feel it , at least for a time . ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly thought to be cold fish ; I can only protest that it is not so . ) I have always assumed that the head of Personnel hired the Loser in part because of his disability ; I have assumed , too , that the Loser was well aware that this was one of the reasons he had been hired . For it became plain early in his sojourn with us that , whether consciously or unconsciously , he trafficked in his lameness . His limp was much more pronounced on the days when he was in need of encouragementthan it was on the days when he was not . I would see him approaching a colleague 's door for help , and his gait would be almost literally tumble-down ; leaving the colleague'sdoor , his gait would be close to normal . Moreover , with a cunning that one could n't fail to admire , he managed to make the low quality of his work a function of his lameness . He was a careless handler of statistics , who sought constantly to borrow the other statisticians ' work notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the condition of his legs ; how , then , did he contrive to trick us into feeling that if we did n't admire his work we were despising him as a cripple ? It was a blackmailthat he practiced with mastery in half a dozen forms . One of the most contemptible of these forms was the device of praising a colleague above his worth , at the same timep151flagrantly abasing himself . One would cringe at the extravaganceof his compliments  --  an analysis of a retirement plan for a bottled-gas handlers ' union can not be dealt with as if it were a canvas by Matisse  --  and one would cringe equally at the intimacy of his confession of self-loathing . He would come up to me , I remember ( very close up to me , for it was among his disagreeable mannerisms to make every encounter an eyeball-to-eyeball affair ) , and assure me that never in a thousand years would he be able to write a presentation as excellent as one of mine . It was a remark that presented difficulties . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of work that reached a certain level of competence was far beyond the Loser . On the other hand , for this very reason the compliment , despite its immense thousand-year scale , was a tiny one . To make matters worse , the Loser , though he happened to be speaking the truth , was the last man on earth by whom one wished to be judged . Even less did one want to be warmly congratulated by him . I would feel his valueless praise fastening itself to me like some odious poultice , but any protest on my part would be in vain . He would hail it as demonstrating that my modesty was a match for my great gifts ; more slovenly glop of commendationwould come flooding in on me . Worst of all was the fact that he really did admire me and really did deplore his ineradicable second-rateness . He saw plainly enough that he was not fit to succeed , but to insist that the rest of us see this , and then that our seeing it be a means of his making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blackmail , and so was his indirectly conveying to the rest of us that if we did n't consent to his becoming a peer , we would be forcing him to become a pariah . All or nothing , said the silent , outrageous threat : there was to be no middlep152ground . That is not how offices of our high reputation are run  --  the middle ground is where the greater part of our work is accomplished , and it is a perfectly honorable place to be  --  but none of us could bear to pronounce anathema upon him ; he was , alas , a member of the human race , and we were still mesmerized by his past miseries . ( So much for our being cold fish ! ) And so he trapped us one by one into a seeming friendship with him . We became unwilling accomplices of his mediocrity . He linked arms with ours and smiled his classic loser 's smile and said how great it was that we were all toilers together in such a wonderful institution . If how losers get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of mystery in it , how losers get fired is also curious and worth examination . In our shop , the word " fired " is nearly always too strong a term for the actual event , which in most cases consists of having reached the last , negligible step in a series  --  of facingthat point of dissatisfaction at which both the company and the employee are equally grateful for a parting of the ways . In the case of the Loser , however , there was an abrupt and identifiable proximate cause , which was an injudicious act of hubris on his part . It appeared that his private life , about which I knew very little , was every bit as ramshackle as his professional one , about which I was getting to know more than I wished to . In the brief time that he worked for the company , the Loser was , as he put it , between marriages , and the moment came when , deciding to cut corners for financial and perhaps other reasons , he simply moved into the office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in retrospect , he actually set up a form of light housekeeping on the premises . The gall of thep153man ! His cubicle was too small to contain a couch , and there must have been many a night when , with some of the partners working late , he could n't avail himself of the couch in the reception room . Perhaps he slept at his desk , or perhaps he stretched out on the linoleum-covered floor ; nor am I beyond supposing that from time to time some poor loser of a girl took pity on him and let him share the sweaty dishevelment of her bed . His desk , as I was later to learn from the office manager , was transformed into a sort of chiffonier  --  odds and ends of ill-pressed clothing filled the drawers , and an overcoat and a pair of galoshes were kept wrapped in a plastic shopping bag in the knee space of the desk . He brought in an electric hot plate , which he kept concealed in a large orange cardboard letter file . Other files held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marmalade and peanut butter . The blotter on his desk grew soggy ; it became a Sargasso Sea of cookie crumbs and specks of cheese . For the first time , the office had a mouse . No doubt the Loser had brought it in with his groceries , in a brown paper bag from the nearest deli . The mouse throve on the Loser 's leavings and , for all I know , became his pet . These distasteful domestic arrangements were to be revealed only after the Loser , true to the temperament of all losers , went too far and by choice became the agent of his doom ; which is to say that he expanded his territoryto include the men 's room . We might never have noticed that he brushed his teeth and shaved there and  --  I trust  --  treated himself to an occasional early-morning sponge bath ; what attracted the attention of no less a person than the chairman of the board and gave us a sufficient reason for discharging the Loser was an incidentp154that resulted from his having the nerve to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle of strings from the mirror above the sinks to the stanchions supporting the toilet-booth doors and suspend from these strings an assortment of newly washed hose , boxer shorts , shirts , and handkerchiefs . Doing his laundry early on Saturday night , before setting out on his weekly spree ( we do not spy on our employees , but there are people about whom it is difficult not to acquire information ) , he would take care to have the laundry down and out of the way before anyoneturned up on Monday morning . Unfortunately , his schedule did not allow for chance visits to the office  --  especially not a chance visit by the chairman , who , on his way home late one Saturday evening from a supper party at " 21 , " had his driver stop off at our building ; it had occurredto him that he might as well pick up some papers that he would be needing to study in preparation for a conference being held the following week . The chairman located the papers in his office and then , passing the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly but also the most efficient of men , thought to take advantage of his opportunity . He pushed open the door , perhaps a trifle vehemently  --  for all his age , he is a man impulsive to the point of brusqueness  --  and the door struck the outer reaches of the Loser 's cat 's cradle of strings . Down on the chairman 's carefully barbered head as he stood in the dark and fumbled for the light switch fell the great soft web of the Loser 's dripping-wet underclothes . It can not have been pleasant , pulling the clammy , unknown things off one 's face and shoulders ; nor can the wetness seeping from the papers into the chairman 's Weatherill evening jacket have improvedmatters . Worst of all must have been the discovery ,  |p155once  the light had been turned on , of what those clammy things were . I have heard that the chairman spent a sleeplessnight and a raging Sunday ; be that as it may , the gravely hung-over Loser had left our employ by Monday noon . Two office boys filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the sidewalk outside the building . It was a week before the mouse was caught , and by then it was half-dead of hunger.  |p156RemembranceRosemary  brought the news home at noon , as proudly as if it had been an A in arithmetic . " Want to know something ? " she asked , sitting down to lunch , and when her mother said , " What is it , dear ? , " she answered , between mouthfuls , " Mr. Hubbard 's dead . " " Oh , no ! " Mrs. Lawrence said . " Our Mr. Hubbard ? " Rosemary nodded . " I saw one of those funny-looking flower things on the door and Katie was just closing the door and I asked her . He 's dead , all right . " " Poor man , I did n't even know he was sick . " Rosemary , who was ten , had not often possessed informationof value . She paid it out little by little as she ate . " He was n't sick , he just died , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " He was awful old . " " He must have been eighty . I ca n't imagine the neighborhoodwithout him . " " Eighty-six . Katie said he went to sleep and never woke up . " " Poor Mrs. Hubbard ! What on earth will she do without him ? "  | " She still has Katie and Jox . " Katie was the Hubbards ' housemaid , and Jox was the Hubbards ' dog . " That 's true . But she and Mr. Hubbard  --  they 've lived in that house so long . They 've never not been there to-gether . " " Maybe I better write her a letter . " " That would be nice , dear . " " Now . " " No , no , finish your lunch first . " " I want to write it now . " " You sure you know what you want to say ? " With shining eyes , scornfully , Rosemary said , " Of course ! Writing 's easy . " In three or four minutes , she was back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrawled over from top to bottom . " You can look at it if you want to , " she said to her mother , neither holding the letter out to her nor withdrawing it . Mrs. Lawrence took the letter , which read : Dear Mrs. Hubbard : So sorry to hear about Mr. Hubbard . We all loved him and you so much . I even overherd some people say you were the wonders of this whole town . And you are . And even now , when one sunbeam has gone from the sky , there are fifty of yours left up there to shine for us . Remember I am thinking of you . Your friend , Rosemary LawrenceMrs . Lawrence gathered Rosemary in against her . " Darling , it 's beautiful , " she said . " Oh , pooh ! " Rosemary said . She adored praise.  | " I think you must be the lovingest child that ever was , " her mother said . " I 'm glad we named you just what we did . " " Whatever that means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to have you , " Mrs. Lawrence said . " In a famous play that you 'll see someday is a girl who 's very sad and is scattering flowers over the stage , and she says , There 's rosemary , that 's for remembrance . ' And I named you for remembrance , and you are . " " Oh , pooh ! " Rosemary said again , this time without pleasure . She did n't understand about the play , but she saw that her mother 's eyes were full of tears , and she hated that . Taking back the letter , she folded it and stuffed it into an envelope . " I 'll leave it under their front door on the way to school , " she said . " We got a big test this afternoon . All about the stupid colonies . " The test was n't really until the next day ; she had told the fib to distract her mother , but , for once , fibs did n't work . " I wish she could have known you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so proud . " Rosemary thrust herself away from her mother . " I 'd never have told you about Mr. Hubbard if I 'd known you were going to be such a crybaby about it , " she said , and ran straight out of the house to keep her mother from kissing her good-bye.  |p159It  will be telling you more about a club I belong to than about me when I say that , as a lawyer , I 'm apt to be looked down on by the other members . Artist members of the club are particularly skeptical of giving us lawyers the run of the place , but they 're by no means alone in their prejudice  --  even the architects appear to consider themselvesbetter than we are , though it beats me how a follower of that dog-eat-dog profession could possibly stick up his nose at anyone outside it . Such distinction as we lawyers may have acquired in the world is beside the point in the Parnassus ; there we are simply people who are not " creative , " whatever that anomalous word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt of innumerablenot very witty jokes . Still , there are times when , far from being looked down on , we come close to being looked up to . These occasions are familiar enough in any club : some nasty little mess , usually involving both money and an infraction of club rules , arises and must be dealt with as quickly and quietly as possible . Oh , then how eagerly we 're sought out and begged  --  with many a flattering word about our special competence in manipulating people andp160keeping confidences  --  to clean up the mess , report its cleaning up in a discreet whisper to the powers that be , and leave not a trace of the mess or our secret labors behind ! More than once in my twenty-odd years in the club , I 've been called on to do such a job . The last time was only a couple of weeks ago , and , to put it far more temperately than it deserves , I 'm still of two minds about it . As a lawyer , I like to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do it in this case , and the sensation is novel and unpleasant . No doubt the affair has troubled me more than it should have , because it marks one of my rare failures . ( I risk sounding vainglorious when I use the word " rare , " but the truth is that my failures , both at the bar and away from it , have been exactly that . After all , the record has been piling up for a good many years now , and can be examined . ) I notice among the younger men in the club a tendency to belittle the competitive spirit , but I was brought up believing in it , and I still do . I like to succeed at things ; what 's more important , I hate failing at them . Frankly , it irks me to have failed so conspicuously in respect to Johnny Pinkham . I gather that I am not  --  or not yet  --  a laughingstock in the club , but I feel like one . I feel outwitted . A certain small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , but the money does n't matter . My annoyance springs from my having been exposed to ridicule in an episode that I strongly preferred to play no part in . It will be a long while before I can be forced to play such a part again . I say " forced , " and the term is not too strong , for , in my opinion , the board of governors , of which I am myself a member , did wrong to drag me into the very middle of the affair . To make an Irish bull , I ought n't to have beenp161dragged into it , because I was already there . Pinkham was an old friend of mine  --  I had , indeed , put him up for the club . To the board , this fact and the fact of my having dealt successfully with similar club matters were reason enough for placing the whole burden of Pinkham 's case on my shoulders ; to me , however , these facts were precisely the reason for not having the burden placed there . As Pinkham'sproposer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potentiallysubject to two thoroughly contrary temptations ; one threatened injury to the club , and the other threatened injury to Pinkham . Either I might be tempted to whitewash him in order to protect my reputation as a judge of men , or I might be tempted to blacken his name unduly in order to punish him for having implicated me in a club mess . Needless to say , to a man of honor both of these temptationswere bound to remain potential , but , knowing human nature , the law has seen fit to remove all such temptations from the ordinary processes of adjudication , and even in private matters they ought not to be lightly disregarded . Moreover , as a lawyer I had already rendered the Parnassusa sufficient number of unrecorded services ; in my modest , " uncreative " way , I had done my share to keep the club the fine institution it is . I tried to beg off on these grounds , and the president said , affecting to speak to the board at large but staring at me across the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty work , and it is a tradition in the club that , wherever possible , this particular dirty work be done by a friend . " Having given in to the president  --  for all his jokes and stories , there is iron in the man , and few people manage to refuse him what he really wants  --  I rang up Pinkham in the country and arranged to meet him at the dhib inp162the following week , on the occasion of his next visit to town . It appeared that he would be taking a late-afternoon train back to Connecticut that same day , so , at some inconvenienceto myself , I agreed to come up to Gramercy Park a little before three . It meant leaving Wall Street a couple of hours early and throwing away the best part of the afternoon , but I had no choice ; as far as I 'd let Pinkham know , our meeting was to be entirely social , and I was afraid that if I made difficulties about the time , he would suggest , in his amiable way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the so-called Red Room of the club ( " so-called " because it was long ago painted white and gold ; the clubhouse was once a private mansion and is old enough to be full of such booby traps for new members ) . It is a rather forbidding room , and few members of the club ever go into it , so it was an admirable place for our encounter . I expected Pinkham to be late and had armed myself with a copy of Country Life and , though it was by no means my usual hour for having a drink , a long Scotch , but he surprised me by being on time . This made me more uneasy than ever about my task . His punctuality was , I thought , a pretty good sign that he suspected why I 'd invited him to stop by . We often saw each other in general gatherings at the club , but it had been a couple of years since we had had a private drink together . Catching sight of me at the windows , Pinkham rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half expected him to vault the couch that lay between the door and me . Would he never slow down , I wondered , never act his age , which was surely past fifty by now ? The curious thing was his being all of a piece in his youthfulness . Some of us , as we grow older , contrive to remain youthful inp163one or two respects , but rarely in many ; Pinkham was remarkablefor the fact that his body , his manner , his interests , his very way of thinking were all those of a playful , intelligent undergraduate . Furthermore , it apparently cost him no effort to keep these diverse aspects of himself up to the same bouncy mark . I would have liked to think that his legs ached from running up to the club 's third-floor dining room two steps at a time , as he always did , but I was sure they did n't suffer the slightest twinge . Instead , it was my legs that ached as I rode up in the elevator and thought of how his legs ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm for new people , new books , new works of art was as spontaneous now as it had been at twenty . Pinkham was a sculptor , and it 's been my experience of sculptors that they tend to go sour a lot earlier than the rest of us . For all I know , this is a hazard of the profession  --  maybe there are n't enough juicy commissions to go around these days , or maybe the gaps between the different schools of sculpture have become so great that they 're no longer schools but armed camps . ( I owe that witticism to our president ; it is one of his good things . ) Whatever the reason may be , it strikes me that sculptors speak more disagreeably about the new men coming up than painters and writers do , and a thousand times more disagreeably than lawyers do . But I except Pinkham . I do n't know whether he was a firstrateor second-rate sculptor , but I know he was a generous one . There was what can only be called a sweetness about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was itself intrinsically young . I had yet to see in him a trace of that tired miserliness of feeling that people have in mind when they call somebody patronizing . But that , of course , is my point : Pinkham never wasp164tired , never had to fake a freshness he did n't feel . Even in respect to his memory ( my own began to decay in my twenties and is now a daily embarrassment to me , not only professionally but at home ) , Pinkham remained a marvel of undiminished alertness . The impressions he took in might have been each of them a first impression , they were so clear and ineradicable . It was unheard-of for him to repeat a story or fail to recall the name of a person to whom he had been even casually introduced . In the nature of things , this made him a very desirable member of the club , and I had often been congratulated on having proposed him . It was unnatural for a man to be as pleased with simply being alive as Pinkham appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his pleasure in life seemed to all of us in the club the truest thing about him . We may not have understood what made him tick  --  I , for all our years of friendship , certainly did n't  --  but we were grateful for his joyous presence amongst us ; though he had been a member for only five or six years , which is a very short time indeed as time inside the club is measured , he was well on his way to serving as our model of a perfect Parnassian . Yet here I was in the Red Room , waiting , at the request of the other members of the board of governors , to ask him to resign . " You 're looking very well , Edward , " he said , and the formality of this  --  for I am nearly always addressed as Eddie  --  I took for a clue to how much he suspected . " I 'm fine , " I said . " A little overweight but fighting it . What 'll you drink ? " " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch . "  |p165I  knew I would feel better if he had a drink in his hand . I said , " You ca n't let me drink alone . " " Is that a Scotch ? All right , I 'll have one , too . " I banged a bell and ordered a Scotch for Pinkham . ( Bells are another booby trap in the club . Though they all look pretty much alike , some must be banged and others twisted to make them ring , and it takes a man years to distinguish bangers from twisters . ) It seemed wise to keep off the reason for our meeting until after his drink had arrived , but Pinkham would have none of it . He was always so open and offhand that it was impossible to build any polite constructions between oneself and him . Ordinarily , one did n't want to , though as a lawyer I may note that I 've a higher opinion of such constructions than most people appear to have nowadays . " Never been in this embalming room before , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly-feeling . " " Oh , I like it , " I said , thinking that if Pinkham had felt an air of unfriendliness , it must be mine and not the room 's . We can never be sure how much of even our most carefully disguised emotions we emanate ; it was certainly true that I was feeling unfriendly , and it was possible that he detected it but mistook the source . Unfriendly , and with good reason , for had n't he let me down in the shabbiest possible way ? I was justified in my irritation , no doubt of that ; yet I did n't want him to become aware of it . The interview promised to be painful enough as it was . " I come in here a lot , " I said . " Especially when I 've some heavy reading to do . " Pinkham ducked his head at the Country Life in my lap . " Do n't let me stop . you . " That was his way of being droll.  | " Heavy , ' I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You buying a place in England ? I pick about three a week out of those front pages . Usually in the Cotswolds . And always with a walled garden . " " Are n't they beautiful ? But England must be getting very rich  --  the prices have been going up at a terrible rate . Even in my imagination , I ca n't afford anything but old rectories . " " Oh , I never worry about the money part ! " Pinkham exclaimed , taking his drink from the waiter . " That 'd spoil the fun . " Over Pinkham 's conventional , not very strong protest , I signed the chit for his drink . He had given me the perfect opening , but I could n't make out whether it had been given to me on purpose ; his face was a merry , boyish blank . " Now that you 've brought up the subject , " I said . Still blankly and merrily , he asked , " What subject is that ? Houses ? England ? " " Money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Johnny , listen . This is serious . I 'm sore as hell at you because of money . " Maybe I 'd been wrong in thinking he knew why I 'd asked him to the club . His ingenuous protest sounded entirely real . " Eddie ! What on earth have I done ? " " For one thing , you 've been extremely rude to my friend John Stanley . " " Stanley ? I do n't even know him , so how can I have been rude to him ? " " Stanley is the club treasurer . " " Oh , my God ! You 're talking about my bills . " " I 'm talking about the fact that you 've been in arrears on your dues for a solid year and in arrears on various housep167charges for at least eighteen months . And have n't had the courtesy to answer a single one of the three perfectly nice , polite letters that John Stanley sent you , asking you either to pay up in tow or , if you could n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying up little by little . " " Where the hell did you get all this inside poop ? " " I 'm on the board of governors . At our regular meetings , matters of this sort come up . Last time , you came up . " " Oh-oh . Very embarrassing for poor Eddie . " " Well , damn it , it was ! And all the more so because you were not a routine case . Nearly always it is a question of some poor old boy who 's been retired on a diminished incomeand ca n't make ends meet but who hates to give up coming to the club for a drink now and then . When those old boys get in too deep , Stanley babies them along as best he can , sometimes in open defiance of the club rules . He 's a kind man , Stanley ; he truly is . But in all my time on the board , there 's never been a case like yours , where a person has not only run up a big bill but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has deliberately refused to give any explanation of his conduct . " " So your kind Stanley 's turning ugly ? " " You 're damn right he is . We all are . Who the hell do you think you are , anyhow ? " I had begun to lose my temper , or , rather , I was making no effort to control it . I was trying to shock Pinkham into perceiving the enormity of what he had done , and I calculatedthat with him , as with a certain kind of flippant but vulnerable witness in court , my own obvious emotional involvement would produce such a shock . " John Pinkham , Esquire , who was , is , and ever shall be your old friend , till debt us do part . " Just for a second , I 'd forgotten the question to which hep168was replying , and the thought flashed through my mind that he had gone insane ; then I remembered , and said , " Spare me your rotten jokes . " " All right , " he said , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch round and round in his hands . " No jokes . " It was surely up to him to speak , but he appeared to feel no obligation to . He sat there unabashed , forcing me by his silence to move on into the unpleasant country ahead . " Talking about you at the meeting , Stanley was a lot nicer than you deserved , " I said . " He said that for all he knew you were traveling about on different jobs and had n't receivedyour mail . He said we were all aware of how scatterbrained about money matters our artist members were apt to be . " " But you were able to assure him that , in fact , I had n't been anywhere . " " Somebody asked me that , and of course I had to tell the truth . Not that Stanley did n't already know . He had the dates of all the chits you 'd signed  --  he could see for himselfyou were still running up bills at the club . Why the devil did n't you answer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I tried . I just could n't think of a thing to say . " " Nonsense ! You could have apologized and paid up . " " That 's where you 're wrong , Eddie boy . That 's precisely what I could n't do . " " Why not ? " " Oh , how pleasant it must be to be married to a rich wife and never , never have to learn the score . " Once on the defensive , a certain kind of witness always resorts to personalities . Still , it was a curious remark forp169Pinkham to make . He had himself been married at one time to a rich wife , and since I had handled his end of the divorce , he must have realized , even as he was speaking , that his words would bring his past into my mind . If my wife was rich , his wife had been far richer , and he had not been above accepting a considerable settlement from her , disguisedas a fair division of properties they had held in common . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I assure you I 've always been able to earn a very good living on my own . " " Yes , but you 've had Barbara 's big , fat income behind you . You 've never had to make a buck in your life . Never not had a buck . " " All this is neither here nor there . " " No ? It 's by way of saying I did n't have a dime and therefore could n't write to your friend Stanley . " " That was the thing to write . It was what he was waiting for , in order to help you . " " You think it 's all that easy to say to a perfect stranger ? If that 's how much you know , do n't get riled when I mentionBarbara 's dough . " " Other people have had to write him . " " Other people are n't me . " Now I was controlling my temper and not finding it easy . " If what it comes down to is your being so goddam special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " It comes down to just that . " " I do n't believe you mean it  --  no sensible man believes that about himself . Nor do I believe it about your being broke . After all , I used to know something about your affairs . "  | " That was a long time ago . I 've never been very good at hanging on to things . " " I would n't have asked you to join the club if I 'd thought you could n't afford it . " " I could at the time . I 'm hoping I can again . You know what sculptors ' commissions are  --  it 's a hell of a long time between the big ones . Uncle Sam seems to have run out of military cemeteries that need a couple of hundred thousand bucks ' worth of bronze and marble . As soon as I can , I 'll pay up here , as I 'll pay up at all the other places in town  --  Brooks Brothers , Abercrombie  --  that carry you forever when things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extraordinary how much he did n't know , and yet it was he who had accused me of being ignorant of life  --  of never learning the score ! " Owing Abercrombie is one thing , owing this place is another , " I said . " Not paying your bills is something you just do n't do in a club . Now it 's too late . " For the first time , I felt I had got inside that youthful , smiling surface . " What do you mean , too late ? I never said I would n't pay . I want to pay , for God 's sake ! " " Johnny , I told you this was serious . You would n't answer Stanley , and he was obliged , under the club rules , to report your case to the board of governors . Now they 've asked me to speak to you . " " O.K. , so you 've spoken to me . Many thanks . And you can report back , if that 's what they want , that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have n't any money , I do n't see how you can turn over any kind of leaf . " " Goddam it , I 'll go to a bank right now and borrow enough of the lousy stuff to pay off the club . Will that satisfy you Scrooges ? "  | " New debts for old ? " " That 's my lookout , is n't it ? " " You keep refusing to listen to what I say . Of course I want you to pay off your debt to the club , and of course it 's none of my business how you get the money to do it , but even though you pay up , it 's still too late . This is n't prep school , you know . What the club is asking for is n't an improvement in your conduct , it 's your resignation . " Then , at last , he stopped smiling . The smooth surface had begun to break up . His face was that of any middleagedman , and when he tried to reconstruct a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed not merely middle-aged , but old . This sort of sudden change is n't as rare as many people think . I 've often seen it happen in court , when a jury brings in an unfavorable verdict . The uttering of a single word is enough to transform a man , and why not , if the word happens to be one that will alter his whole life ? At the start of my interview with Pinkham , the uneasiness had been on my side ; now it was on his . Those blazing blue eyes had , I thought , a distinct flicker of panic in them . He said , " Now you 're the one that 's telling jokes . " " On the contrary , I 'm in deadly earnest . I have been all along . Ca n't you be clear about the situation ? You 've been acting like a spoiled ten-year-old , you 've been an irresponsible brat , but God knows I 'm still your friend and would rather a thousand times not be telling you this  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake , Eddie ! " " But the board has requested me to tell you you 've no choice except to resign . " He put down his glass and said , " Let 's have another round . " He twisted the bell , but nothing happened . " Damnp172these f a l things ! " he said . " If I live to be a thousand , I 'll never barn . " Then he banged the bell and , as the waiter approached , gestured to him that we would like two more of the same . " Tell me , do I write this famous letter before or after paying up ? " he asked . " I 'm sure you know the etiquette . " " The best arrangement would be to write the letter and enclose with it a check in payment of your total indebtedness to the club . Then the board can vote to accept your resignationat the next meeting and the incident will be closed . " " Incident , ' Eddie ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a harsh one . " " You keep saying kind . ' Stanley 's kind , you 're kind , I suppose the whole board is kind . And discreet , as well ? " " As to that , nobody in the club will ever know anything . " " Except that I 've resigned . I ca n't help hoping that somebodywill notice that . " " I was about to say how much you will be missed here , Johnny . You were certainly one of the most popular members of the club . " " Were . ' I see what you mean by kind . ' " " Do n't make this any more difficult for me than it is already . You know how much I personally will miss you in the club . And how proud I 've always been of your popularityamong the members . If I 'd been a different sort of person , I 'd have been bound to be quite openly jealous of you . In my twenty years here , I 've made nothing like the mark you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them words . " How he spoiled things ! But I kept on . For his sake , I wanted to leave nothing unsaid . " If I 'd known about your troubles earlier , if you 'd dropped me the slightest hint , Ip173might have been able to straighten the whole thing out . The business of your being broke  --  I 'd have been glad to help you over that hurdle . " " Thank you for that , too . " I could n't resist adding , " With my money , I may say , not Barbara 's . " " I 'm sorry I said that . " " No matter . " " You say you might have helped me . I do n't suppose you could help me now ? " " Financially ? I 'm certainly willing to talk it over and see what we  --  " " Nothing that simple . It just occurred to me that you might be kind enough , generous enough , to practice a little hanky-panky for my sake . " I did n't like it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle grimly , I said , " Go on . " " Suppose I borrow some money today and pay off my debt here , then drop out of sight for a week or two , and at the next meeting of the board you explain that you have n't been able to get in touch with me and therefore have n't been able to ask me to resign . Then Stanley pops up and says , Well , anyhow , the little so-and-so is all paid up . ' And you say  --  could n't you say ?  --  In that case , since Pinkham does n't know of the action we took at our last meeting and has had the decency to clean up this mess on his own , is there any possibility of our forgetting the whole thing , of not asking the poor fellow to resign , after all ? ' Adding , if you felt up to it , I think I can promise on his behalf that the problem will never come up again ' ? " It was I who had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shocking me . I felt nowp174that I had seriously misread as much of his character as had been open to my observation . It struck me that back of the boyish openness , the generous high spirits , there must lie a distinct talent for duplicity . That gift was far from being merely youthful ; the only word I could find to apply to it was " feminine . " Women tend to solve problems in what they call a sensible or practical fashion , which is to say without regard to morality , sailing past all abstract questions of right and wrong as if they were the sheerest irrelevancies . I had n't expected to find that tendency in Pinkham , and I said , " Do you honestly think I could do such a thing ? " " Now , Eddie ! " he said . " Do n't go climbing up on your high horse ! " " The governors made a certain decision , which I was requested to carry out . That 's what I 'm doing now , as justly as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world to say such a thing , Pinkham said , " I 'm not asking for justice , Eddie . I 'm asking you to do me a favor . " " Which I tell you I ca n't do . " " Wo n't do . " " Must n't do  --  is that any clearer ? " " I should think it would be pretty awkward sometimes having such goddam high principles . " " It 's awkward right now , but the principles are still there . " " Poor Eddie . I 've put you through a lot , have n't I ? " The waiter set down our drinks , and Pinkham reached for the chits , and , with a show of lightness but intending a warning ( for I know how even the most loyal of club servants gossip belowstairs ) , I said , " Johnny ! The drinks are on me. "  | " No , no , this time they 're mine , " he said , and reached up to take a pencil from the waiter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick a public fight with you , " I said , indicating the waiter as best I could with a raising of my eyebrows , " but the fact is you ca n't sign for anything here any more . " He had crouched forward to scribble his name on the bits of paper the waiter had put on the table between us . Now , as he watched the waiter pick them up and carry them away , he maintained the awkward posture , intent and yet helpless-seeming , of a paralytic waiting to be shifted from one chair to another . Slumped forward like that , he looked a hundred years old . It was a hard moment for both of us , and , to hurry us past it as tactfully as possible , I raised my glass and said the first thing that came into my head : " Votre sante ! " " Sante , " he mumbled , with a sidelong glance of surprise , then , " Thanks for the libation . Much obliged . " " Do n't be silly . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our club drinks are notoriously strong , and tossing them down like that , no matter what the provocation , is always a fool thing to do . Pinkham got slowly to his feet . " So long , Eddie , " he said . " I 'm off to the bloody bank . " As he stood there , two things  --  my own evocation of the happiness he had once brought us and the look of him slumped in the chair and sloshing down that far too powerfuldrink  --  prompted me to wonder if there was any as yet unconsidered way out of the mess . In my experience , this sort of question reaches the surface of the mind only when an answer to it has already been prepared somewhere in the depths . No sooner did I begin to consider the problemp176afresh than a possible solution occurred to me . It was one that could n't have occurred to me before the start of our interview , because it was the interview itself that had provided the necessary ingredients . What if Pinkham were to pay up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that meeting , I were able to make a statement , disturbing but not too specific , about the condition I had found him in ? A statement that would make the other members of the board sympathetic to rejecting his resignation ? I would have to say something that was n't a lie , and therefore would n't betray the board 's confidence in me , but that would nevertheless rehabilitate Pinkham in their eyes . What would such a something be ? Plainly , something to do with health . I could tell them , and not with a bad conscience , that I had reason to believe he had undergone some kind of obscure emotional breakdown in the course of the past year , evidence of which I had detected in his speech , his manner , his very eyes ; that this breakdown had led to his deplorable irresponsibility in respect to money and his still more deplorable rudeness in respect to John Stanley ; but that I felt sure ( here I could mildly hint at having received a medical opinion ) that , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the board would have nothing to fear in future from our brilliant and high-spirited friend . . . . Yes , I thought , I might just bring it off . It would be worth trying , and , as a born advocate , I would be interested to try it . On several grounds , I could n't let Pinkham in on my plans . Circumstances might make it impossible for me to attempt it , or I might attempt it and fail , in either case causing him bitter disappointment . A worse hazard was Pinkham 's taking offense at my belief  --  the honorable basis for my solution to the problem  --  that , by George ,  |p177there  was something a little odd about him . Pride is a curious emotion , flaring up at the most inappropriate moments , and Pinkham might flatly refuse to let me plead his oddness before the board . Though I was thus prevented from offering him any reason to hope for a reprieve , much less a full pardon , I had to make certain that he sent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview was on a Wednesday , and the board was to meet on the following Tuesday . Stanley , that naturally forgiving man , would need a day or two in which to begin to forget Pinkham'soffense before his case came up . It seemed obvious that the fastest way to get the money to Stanley would be for me to lend it to Pinkham . Breaking the awkward silence , I said , " Do n't tell me if you do n't want to , but how much will you be needing ? " " I must owe three or four hundred here  --  " " Three hundred and seventy-six fifty , to be exact . " He stared , then went on . " So maybe I 'd better ask the bank for five . They 'll think I 'm good for that , wo n't they ? " " Of course . But let me handle it instead . I 'll give you a lot better terms than any bank . They pretend to be charging six per cent , but it 's closer to twelve . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need it , and at no interest . " Then he said something that fitted very nicely into my plans . I grant it was the sort of teasing remark with which any sensitive person might reject an offer that he was nevertheless grateful to have heard a friend voice ; still , it could also be cited as establishing a certain emotional imbalance on the part of the speaker . " I 'd much rather stick a bank with a bad debt than you , " he said . " I would n't feel free to step in front of a bus or fall off a bridge or have any fun at all if I owed money to a friend . " I noted , for my own purposes , this sufficiently clear threatp178of suicide , then brushed it aside . " I 'd really like to do it , Johnny . " " I do n't know when I could pay it back . " " I 've said it does n't matter . " " You do n't think five sounds like too much ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shrugged then , as if on an unexpected impulse of surrender . I suppose I 'll never know whether this had been his intention from the start . At the time , I felt sure I had prevailed on him to accept the money against his better judgment . Perhaps a little inflated by this victory , I reached for my wallet , fished a blank check from it , and made it out to Pinkham in the sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars . " Somehow , that always seems a rounder sum to me than six , " I said . " No , no ! It 's too much ! " " I want it that way . " " This is more money than I 've seen in ages . You 're tempting me to run amuck . " " Nonsense , " I said . " I 'm not worried about that . " Pinkham took the check , folded it , and put it away in a trousers pocket . I understood that it would have been impossible for him to thank me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have begun to take effect that soon , but he walked as if it had . In the doorway , he swung about , and , poor as the light in the Red Room always is , I was able to make out the look of incredulityon his face . " My God , Eddie ! " he said . " What on earth 's the matter ? " " I 've forgotten his name . " " Whose name is that ? " " Your kind friend . The one I 've been so rude to . "  | " Stanley . John Stanley . " Then he smiled and said the last thing I was ever to hear him say in the club : " So this is what it feels like to forget things . " I brought with me to the meeting of the board on Tuesday evening a sheet of foolscap bearing some notes for the talk I planned to give on Pinkham . My assumption was that John Stanley would first report to us that Pinkham had paid his debt to the club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before putting the matter of this resignationto a motion the board might wish to hear a word or two from me . This was the usual practice in these affairs and would provide me with an ideal opportunity to save Pinkham 's life in the club . I knew pretty well what I was going to tell them , and I think  --  though again this may sound vainglorious  --  that I would have swept them off their feet . My rough notes will indicate the nature of the proposedoration better and more fairly than I , in my disillusionment , can now do ; they go as follows , verbatim : Such episodes always painful . This episode especially painful to me . Pinkham a most charming fellow . Soul of clubbability . Our twenty years of friendship . Proud to put him up for the club . Bask in reflected glory . No doubt of his standing in the Running up large bills here . Our beloved treasurer 's tactful promptings.  |p180All  in vain . Inexcusable rudeness . Nevertheless , if any excuse , this was it . Pinkham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the club a mere mask of the real person . His brightness all for us . Darkness and despair within . Too proud to reveal this darkness . Easy perhaps for doctor to detect . Discovered by me after long probing . Terrible look in Pinkham 's eyes . Air almost of madness . Threat of suicide . Horror at having to leave club . Shame at having offended Stanley . My question . Admittedly most irregular , but my judgment perhaps worth something in these matters . Could n't we find it in our hearts , one way or another , to table poor Pinkham 's resignation ? Give him a second chance ? Make all the difference in the world to him . Fresh start . New career . I personally to vouch for him . Best tribute to values of club life . Values of the Parnassus in particular . So precious to all of us . As I say , I 'm sure my talk , presented with an adequate amount of feeling , would have sufficed to restore Pinkham to the good graces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Stanley was late getting to the dinner , and I had no chance to consult with him beforehand . When the presidentcalled on him for his report , he got up and mentioned , in his matter-of-fact way , among half a dozen items of no particular importance , that he had heard nothing from John Pinkham since our last meeting , that Pinkham 's debt was still outstanding , and that , unless I had something to suggest to the contrary , he would like to hear a motion to the effect that Pinkham be dropped from the club roster therewith . The president said that his recollection had been refreshed by the treasurer 's remarks and that he now remembered having asked me to solicit Pinkham 's resignationat the last meeting ; would I care to speak on that point ? I would n't . The fact was that I was too astonished to speak . I could only shake my head and throw up my hands in a gesture of helplessness . Under the circumstances , this was the wisest thing I could have done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had been able to say anything . The president called for a motion , which was made , seconded , and carried  --  unanimously , I may add . The next morning , I received a letter from Pinkham , which I append . You will note from it that he had managed almost overnight to regain his accustomed bouncy high spirits . How he can have written the letter after what passed between us in the Red Room I do n't hope to understand . I 've said that I feel outwitted , and the letter will show why . EDDIE , OLD COCK ! Well , I cashed your fat check and then could n't resist paying off a lot of nasty little debts up here in Connecticut , including the local grocery store and the water company and the phone company and the lightp182company , and after that I ordered a lot of clay from a place that does n't grant me credit any more and that took a big dollop of cash , and before you could say Jack Robinson , I had gone straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penny left over for the poor old club . Kiss its brownstone walls good-bye for me . I 'll miss those dear old coots and I hope they miss me . I realize , though , that I got out in the nick of time . I was actually growing old in there ! Clubs do that , I guess . You seemed such a damnably serious old-maid fussbudget sitting there lecturing me the other day . I thought , my God , my poor Eddie ! Is that what the club can do to a man ? I know I 'm a wretch to have pulled this fast one on you , but if you had any idea how merry I am this morning , setting to work here  --  ! As the fellow said , if I felt any better , I 'd be dangerous . Your wicked but not very contrite , J. P. , Esq . P.S. Apologize most profusely to the treasurer on my behalf . I swear I 'll pay him sometime . P.P.S. Stanley his name is . John Stanley.  |p183In  the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an impassive little girl named Harriet , took all their meals in the big , formal dining room of the Connor place on Prospect Hill . They were waited on by one or another of a series of couples  --  Axel and Olga , Peter and Della , George and Daisy  --  all of whom appeared ideally unselfishand hard-working during the early months of their tenure and who then lurched unsteadily downward into shiftlessness and debauchery . Or , rather , one member of the couple always did so , for by some fixed law of complementaryopposites , if the woman were capable and sedulous , the man was a drunk ; if the man liked nothing better than to sit up until midnight polishing silver or transforminga portion of the cellar into a playroom for Harriet , the woman would be whoring away downtown , in some steamy hotel bedroom available by the hour . The only perfect couple that Connor and Harriet ever encountered were Jack and Larry , who gave them five years of impeccable , cheerful service . Though Connor would n't have thought twice about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly never have thought of them as lovers , he was wary of hiring two men ; he subsequentlytook care to speculate as little as possible upon the nature of their private lives . It turned out that they were very quiet up there on the third floor , which they had to themselves . Connor knew so little about homosexuality , including even the appropriate descriptive terms , that he always referred to his perfect couple behind their backs as effeminate . As to that , he was half-right . Jack was a sweetfacedlittle nest builder and thus a natural consort for the virile bully-boy , Larry , who , foaming with curls from head to foot , was often to be found serving breakfast with half a dozen bloody Band-Aids affixed to his face . His explanation was always the same : he had been set upon by a gang of black drug addicts from the North End . " But I gave as good as I got , " he would say , with a ghastly smile . The chances were that he was telling the truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity of manifesting this bent at home by falling in love and threatening to leave Larry . After the first noisy fight that they had ever inflicted upon Connor and Harriet , it was discovered in the morning that Larry had strangled Jack to death with the silk cord of his dressing gown . The event was a terrible shock to the Connors . Neither father nor daughter had ever been so close to the consequences of raw emotion before ; Connor at sixty and Harriet at twenty-one were like untutored children , and this evidence of what lust and jealousy could lead to made them sick to their stomachs . The crime was a three-day wonder in the town . Connor 's personal misery was scarcely diminishedby the degree to which he had been made conspicuousas the employer of a murdered , to say nothing of a murderee  --  was he as prudent a man as bankers arep185supposed to be ? Not to mince words , was Connor soft on fairies ? Was it possible that he himself  --  ? Oh , dear , no , but for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met on the street or in the bank was thinking , Oh , dear , yes . The murder was by far the greatest melodrama in which the Connors had taken part . The second-greatest came ten years later , but the world would have been far from consideringit in a class with a celebrated crime  --  it was simply a few moments of minor domestic crisis , and when those moments had passed , there was no outward sign that nothingwould ever be the same in that house again . The circumstances in which the crisis arose had at least an indirect connection with Jack 's death . For in the distress engendered by the murder and its attendant publicity , Connor and Harriet had shrunk from the ordeal of selecting successors to Jack and Larry ( who , tried and sentenced , was reported to be having a good time in state prison : it was his sort of place ) . Connor and Harriet had acquired more than enough evidence that satisfactory couples were impossible to find and that even adequate single servants were in short supply . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in being pinned down to a job . She certainly did n't need the money , and her volunteer work at the hospital and elsewhere gave her a sufficient sense of keeping busy . She proposed that she assume the task of running the house , calling on such daily outside help as might prove necessary . Big as the house was , there were only two of them , after all . They pictured their servantless status as a pleasing , if perhaps only temporary , adventure . They would be like babes in the wood , with no one but themselves to answer to.  |p186Very  early in the experiment , they gave up taking their meals in the dining room , which was at an irritating distance from the kitchen and was , in any event , a gloomy cave , paneled in mahogany and hung with large paintings of dead fish and animals . They enjoyed exploring the unfamiliar territory of the kitchen and its appendages . It was a lark for them to learn where pots and frying pans were hung and where the crocks of raisins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they mastered , little by little , the eccentricities of the ancient gas range . After a few months , the playful feeling of camping out gave way to a sense of the drudgery of preparing meals and serving them ; they began to cut corners , omitting butter plates and unnecessary knives and forks and pretending that , for their health 's sake , they no longer had any interest in desserts . Connor failed to notice the extent to which they had altered their arrangements . Whenever Harriet happened to make some reference to what had begun to seem their former grandeur , he would look up in astonishment from the chipped enameled-iron kitchen table and say , " Oh , come , this is n't so bad ! It 's nice and snug , and it saves time . " Though Harriet had never done so , she might have repliedthat they had little reason to save time . Connor was a vice-president of the local First National Bank , and , as such , he had scarcely enough work to occupy a full day . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chores that it amused him to perform  --  rolling the trash cans from the kitchen door to the street , or returningthem from the street to the kitchen door , and , in season , fussing over his small rose garden and the shrubbery surrounding the house  --  never used up more than an hour . By six he had read the evening paper , washed his hands ,  |p187and  was waiting to eat supper . Afterward , when the dishes had been dried and put away , he went upstairs to his bedroom and turned on the television . There , with a blanket over his knees , a sports magazine in his lap , he sat until midnight , dozing and waking , waiting until it should be late enough to undress , take out his teeth , and go to bed . Harriet 's day was hardly more eventful . Since they had shut off the third floor , and only two of the five bedrooms on the second floor were ever in use , she finished cleaning the house by noon . Having warded off the plumpness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lunch of lettuce and cottage cheese , she went downtown to do some shopping . One or two afternoons a week she went to a movie . Her father regarded going to movies while the sun was shining as a species of crime , and unless it happened to be raining , Harriet never told him of her debauch . Every Friday she had her hair washed and set at the most expensive of the local beauty parlors . Though she experimented from time to time , she was so conscious of being over thirty that she invariably ended with a neat bun of hair at the base of her skull . Once a month she had a manicure , but since her father referred to other women 's red-enameled fingernails as claws , she was careful to ask for a colorless polish . Friday was the most rewarding day of the week , not because of her visit to the beauty parlor , but because of the reason for that visit . Every Friday night Harriet had her date . It was always with the same man , Roger Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a year or so past forty and had never been married . It was understood that he had heavy expenses , not alone because he had to support his widowed mother but also because there was a shadowyp188defective aunt or uncle to be supported in an institution somewhere . He was exceptionally tall and exceptionally thin and he looked as if , tapped sharply on the belly button , he would buckle like a bridge in a high wind . His face seemed to have more features than were absolutely necessary ; this was an optical illusion , based on the fact that his eyes , ears , nose , and mouth had been gathered into the lower portion of his face , on the foundation of an inassertivechin . He was full of small talk , not in the least malicious , and it pleased him to be able to make Harriet laugh . Andrews 's visits followed a precise schedule , perhaps natural in a teller . He would arrive at the house at eight o'clock , dressed in a blue suit and wearing the polka-dot tie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrews would ring the doorbell once , very gently ; Harriet 's father , having stayed downstairs in order to performhis once-a-week function as host , would be waiting for him just inside the door . The door would fly open in Andrews 's face . " Why , hello , young man ! " Connor would say , in a tone of friendly surprise . Andrews would say , " Good evening , sir , " and then , " Is Harriet in , sir ? " and Connor would say , " I think so , Roger . Just a minute and I 'll go up and see . " Harriet would be waiting in the doorway of her room , fully prepared for the evening . Conventional in everything , she always had it in mind to follow the principle that a man should be kept waiting for at least ten minutes , but within five minutes she would be running down the stairs to greet him , feeling her freshly washed hair with her fingertips and smiling her still-girlish smile . For she was glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , " Hello , Harriet , " andp189she would say , " Hello , Roger , " and then her father would call down to them from the head of the stairs , " Now , do n't stay out too late , you two " or " Do n't be coming in at all hours . And do n't forget to turn off the porch lights . " Harriet and Roger had been going out every Friday for a couple years now , and they had never returned to the house later than half past eleven , but her father always repeated this advice in the same half-mocking , half-admonishing tone . As soon as Harriet got home , she took off her dress and hung it in her bedroom closet , which smelled of sachet and naphthalene . Then , in a bathrobe and slippers , she would go downstairs and prepare for her father a second supper of sandwiches and hot chocolate to make up for his having had to spend the evening alone . She arranged everything daintily on the tray , and her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all that bother for him ; he was n't a bit hungry . Harriet would answer that it was n't any bother and that she hoped it would help him to have a good night 's sleep . The fact was that the chocolate gave Connor a restless night , but he was too grateful for Harriet 's thoughtfulness to put an end to the custom . One Friday evening Connor was seated in the big wing chair in his bedroom , listening to the news he had heard four or five times over , when at eleven twenty-five Harriet opened the front door . She locked the door behind her , snapped off the porch lights , and came upstairs . Hearing her footsteps , he busied himself with a magazine . When she stopped at his door , he asked her , " Have a nice time with Roger , dear ? " With his teeth out , " nice " tended to become a drunken-sounding " nyshe . " " Fine . "  | " Go to a movie ? " " M-m-m . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Coke . " Something in his daughter 's voice caused Connor to glance up at her . Living at close quarters , they had long since given up seeing each other clearly  --  it was a mercy not to be burdened from day to day with the intimate topography of a face . Riffling the pages of the magazine with a show of alertness , he said , " I wonder if you have n't been trying to do too much lately ? I mean with the houseworkand all ? " " Nonsense . " Alert , alert ! The threat of trouble always made him sleepy . He could scarcely hold his head up . " Well , but you do n't look well . Maybe we ought to try getting hold of some servants again . " " It is n't that . " Then something else , which was either to be explored or it was not . He would much rather it was not . " Shades of Axel and Olga ! " he said . " And Peter and Della  --  rememberthem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter keep a flock of chickens in the back yard . He cared a damn sight more for those chickens than he did for Della . " " I 'm sure . " " And Jack and Larry  --  oh , Lord ! " But he must n't begin on them . Though they had provided Harriet and him with so many delightful occasions , it was impossible to describe the means by which they had brought those occasions about . There was a mystery for Connor in their capacity to makep191themselves and other people happy , out of ingredients that did n't bear examination . Were n't they lustful , jealous , depraved ? Yet they had made stolid little Harriet clap her hands with joy ; they had made Connor feel half his age and only half a Puritan . To think that the pleasant times for the four of them had had to end with the cord of a dressing gown , a face bulging blue-purple over the foot of a bed ! " Now , if there 's anything between you and Roger , " Connor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Harriet would be as quick as he to perceivethe falseness of , " and I would n't be surprised if there was , after all these years , why , out with it ! If you 've been thinking of me instead of him , if Roger wants you to marry him and you 've been afraid of leaving me alone in this big old house , you can dismiss that thought from your mind this very minute . " He stood up , the magazine slipping off his knees , and crossed the room to her , moved by his words , by the immensity of the sacrifice he was prepared to make . " I 'll get along fine , " he said . " You do n't have to worry about me . " Harriet stared at him , wetting her lips . She tried to laugh again , but the sound broke in her throat , with the sullen unbecomingness of a burp . She said , " He has n't asked me . Is n't that ridiculous ? Is n't that the funniest thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she turned and hurried down the hall to her room . Connor started to follow Harriet , then heard her bedroom door slam shut behind her . After a moment or two he walked down the long , curving flight of stairs to the front hall . He snapped on the lights in the hall , the dining room , the butler 's pantry , and the kitchen . He opened the breadbox and gathered up a handful of crackers , took a bottle ofp192milk and some cottage cheese from the icebox , poured the milk into a glass , spread the cheese on the crackers , returnedthe milk bottle and the cheese to the icebox , and set the glass and crackers on a tray . He would have liked to prepare some sandwiches and hot chocolate , but it was literally the case that he did n't know how . He was unable to cover the tray with a doily because he did n't recall where the doilies were kept . Balancing the tray with care , he stopped to snap off the lights in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed the stairs , the milk spilled from time to time over the top of the glass and one of the crackers fell from the tray to the floor . He carried the tray to Harriet 's door and knocked with the back of one hand . He could hear Harriet crying inside the room , and he felt himself beginning to cry as he stood there rapping on the closed door , the discolored tray in his hands . " Harriet ! " he said . " Now , Harriet ! Let your old dad in ! "  |p193When  John Lawrence was a new father , twenty-odd years ago , he was fairly good at making up stories , but somewhere along the line he lost the knack . At forty-six , he was a full forty-two years older than his son Charles , and his powers of invention were n't what they had been in the days when he used to hold Charles 's older brother and sisters spellbound . As a last child , Charles was , of course , especially doted on . Every moment with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut a distinguished figure in his son 's eyes . He certainly did n't fail him out of impatience or laziness , as , in his youth , he occasionally may have failed some of the other children . If he failed Charles in respect to storytelling , it was because he simply could n't help it . Charles slept late , while John Lawrence left the house early and was away all day . Charles 's bedtime was thereforeLawrence 's only opportunity to make a good impression on him . Nightly , Mrs. Lawrence scrubbed Charles to a high pink shine and got him into pajamas and tucked him between the sheets and  --  told him a story or two ( herp194powers never failed ) and sang to him and kissed him a dozen times on ear and chin and nose and foot and neck and back of neck . His enormous eyes were heavy with sleep . He lay on the outermost verge of slipping off ; all that was required was that his father ease him along with a rousing tale , as any ordinary father could and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary father . For him , the stories refused to flow . The gift had gone . For almost a year , Lawrence floundered his way through this tiny hell of parental failure . Night after night , he would be summoned upstairs , and Charles would pat the place on his bed where Lawrence was to lie . " Tell me a story , " Charles would command , and Lawrence would begin , " Once upon a time . . . " Instantly , he would feel his throat constricting , his tongue growing dry , and a terrible lassitude sweeping in over him . Every start was a false start ; the castles he conjured up proved all too easy to storm , and the giants inside them had nothing horrible to say . No sooner had the portcullises rattled up on their great chains than John Lawrence would yawn and ask , " And then what do you suppose happened ? " A moment later , he would lift himself on one elbow and stare blindly down through the dark at the ardent creature beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had fallen asleep . But Charles was never asleep ; irritation with his father would have goaded him into nervous wakefulness . " Go on ! " he would say . " Ca n't you see I 'm waiting ? " In the end , it was Lawrence who would wind up drugged with sleep , while Charles would have regained the energeticbrightness of midday . Mrs. Lawrence would have to be called on to stir up her husband and soothe her son , and she did n't know which was the harder task . Surely , the Lawrences told each other , there must be some solutionp195to the problem that hung so forbiddingly over them , but as things turned out , it was Charles and not his parents who found it . One night he broke into his father 's first " And then . . . and then " to ask , " What if I tell you a story ? " Already sleepily : " That would be great . " " Which do you want to hear about  --  Christopher Robin or Robin Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , once upon a time , in a deep , deep forest , there lived a man named Robin Hood . And he loved to kill people . " Suddenly wakeful , John Lawrence said , " That does n't sound like the Robin Hood I know . " " This is a made-up story . One day Robin Hood took his bow and arrow and  --  zing  --  he shot the sheriff and then  --  zing !  - -  he shot Friar Tuck and then  --  zing !  --  he shot Little John . " In a voice blurred with pleasure , Charles said , " He shot everybody in the whole forest , is n't that a good story ? " and at once fell fast asleep . The next night , Charles again volunteered to tell his father a story , and John Lawrence chose to hear about Christopher Robin instead of Robin Hood . " Well , once upon a time , in a deep , deep forest , there lived a boy named Christopher Robin , " Charles said . " And he loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse  --  bang !  --  and his bear  --  bang !  --  and his mother  --  bang !  - -  and his father  --  bang ! " The bangs grew softer as the story went on , and at the last bang , Charles sighed deeply and fell asleep .
