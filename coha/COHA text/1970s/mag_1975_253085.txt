What is it like to work a 36-hour shift ? That is precisely how long Dr. Edward Condon , 28 , was on virtually continuous duty " recently at New York City 's 970-bed Elmhurst Hospital as part of his internship . The log of his prolonged " day " : <P> Assigned to a ward that was designed for 40 patients but is sometimes crowded with 50 or more , Condon reported for duty at 8 a.m . He immediately began taking blood samples from patients , then at 9 a.m. broke off to accompany a resident as he stopped at patients ' bedsides . At 11:30 he wolfed down a sandwich and spent the rest of his lunch hour in the library reviewing patients ' records to prepare himself for teaching rounds , when he would tour the ward with an attending physician . From 4 p.m. , when the tour ended , until dinnertime , Condon continued his morning routine . <P> Condon had planned to share the overnight duty with another intern , covering the ward from 6 p.m. to midnight while his colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his partner watched the ward . But at 7 p.m. the hospital admitted a heart-attack victim , and Condon 's plans quickly changed . While the other intern took over the ward , Condon and the resident administered powerful drugs and oxygen to the patient . When he failed to respond , they inserted a tube in his windpipe to assist his breathing . In an effort to ease the burden on the patient 's heart and lungs , they drew off some of his blood and then infused only the red cells back to him over a period of several hours . Condon stayed with the patient until his condition stabilized at 7 a.m. then tried unsuccessfully to catch a catnap on a stretcher . At 8 a.m. , after a three-minute breakfast of toast and coffee , he was back in the ward starting another day . <P> At 6 that evening , as Condon prepared to leave for home , he learned that despite the intensive care , his heart-attack patient had died . The intern then had to call the patient 's family , notify them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Condon admits that such hectic shifts are not routine , but feels that for him they occur too often . He believes that tired physicians may overlook things in their examinations and " minimize the symptoms . " He argues that , while fatigue is bad for a physician , it is even worse for his patient .
