It was , after all , a predictably mercurial meeting of the Arab League . As long as the television lights were turned on and the TV cameras were running , leaders of 20 Arab states ( plus the Palestine Liberation Organization ) who gathered at league headquarters in Cairo spoke glowingly of Arab solidarity . Once the switches had been turned off , however , the conferees stopped smiling and disappeared into closeted quarters . There for two days they argued bitterly about the plan to end Lebanon 's bloody 18-month civil war that had been agreed on at an Arab summit in Riyadh , the capital of Saudi Arabia ( TIME , Nov. 1 ) . At that meeting , the league members most involved in the Lebanese cease-fire - Lebanon , Egypt , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the P.L.O.-had agreed to a new 30,000-man peace-keeping force and to enforce the Cairo accord of 1969 , which constricts Palestinian movement within Lebanon . <P> The main problem in Cairo was that too many of the Arab states distrust each other 's intentions in Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 21,000-man Syrian force that President Hafez Assad had dispatched to Lebanon ; initially sent to impose an armistice between the warring factions , the Syrians later sided with the rightist Christians in battles against the Moslem leftists and their Palestinian allies . In Riyadh , the Arab leaders agreed that some or all of the Syrian troops would be part of the new peace-keeping force , which is to be bankrolled largely by the Saudis ( estimated cost : $90 million in the first six months ) and supervised by Lebanese President Elias Sarkis . <P> That plan ran into difficulty in Cairo as soon as the meeting was brought to order . Iraq 's Foreign Minister Saadun Hammadi , whose government had sent 2,000 troops into Lebanon on the Palestinian side , demanded the full withdrawal of Syrian forces from the country . He denounced the Riyadh pact authorizing them to become part of the post-armistice force . Hammadi 's demands plunged the first major Arab summit in two years into a bitter dispute . <P> Syrian Uniforms . In the end , however , the clout of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overwhelming political power in the region , Syria , which currently has the military strength , and Saudi Arabia , which has the money , hung together to insist on ratification of the Riyadh agreement . Syria 's President Assad , who until the Riyadh meeting had been at odds with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , spoke glowingly of " this good land of Egypt " and praised " my brother Sadat . " Lebanese Delegate Najib Dahdah attacked Hammadi for interfering in the internal affairs of his country-ignoring the fact that Syria has interfered considerably more than Iraq . In the end , the Arab League members-with Iraq voting against the Riyadh endorsement-agreed on a plan that will allow Lebanon 's President Sarkis to choose soldiers from any state that offers them . So far , troops have been offered by Saudi Arabia , North and South Yemen , the United Arab Emirates , Sudan , Libya and the P.L.O . The expectation is , however , that when the force is finally drawn up , the bulk of its members will be wearing Syrian uniforms .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
