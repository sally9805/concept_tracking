My kite rises to celestial regions , My soul enters the abode of bliss . - Buddhist monk , 9th century A.D. <P> <P> Kites have dared the heavens for thousands of years , pacifying the gods , protecting souls , relaying lovers ' messages , celebrating the seasons . Frorn the Chinese Han dynasty through the space age , kites made of leaves , paper , silk and now plastic have also been used to catch fish , spy on enemies , send signals , divine the weather , explore the atmosphere , photograph the earth , tow boats , advertise corsets , drop bombs and loft men and women into the wind . In the past decade the kite , the honorable ancestor of all aircraft , has colored American skies in vast numbers , dazzling hues , and sufficient shapes , sizes and forms to fill catalogs of bliss . <P> Sales of kites soar higher every year , seemingly resistant to economic downdrafts . Manhattan 's Go Fly A Kite , the first kite store to open in the U.S. , in 1965 , grossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 90 such stores nationwide . Valerie Govig , 43 , editor of Kite Lines , the only U.S. magazine devoted to the pastime , sees " an increased sophistication and appreciation of kites as an art , a science and an adult sport . " An estimated 150 million kites will be sold this year . People turn out in ever greater profusion for such events as the Great Boston Kite Festival in mid-May and the Smithsonian Institution 's March Kite Carnival in Washington , D.C.

" A major attraction of kiting is that it is a peaceful pastime in which competition evokes more ahs than urrghs . It can also be one of the least expensive of sports . The traditional two-stick diamond costs only about 500 ; its major maker , the 56-year-old Hi-Flier Manufacturing Co. in Decatur , Ill. , sells millions of them yearly . An exotic 45-ft. dragon made of Mylar costs only about $8 , while a large tetrahedral model sells for $20 . ( On the other hand , fancier , higher-flying kites can cost up to $2,000 . ) A 500-ft. - long , 30-lb. - test string costs about $1.25 . <P> Unlike almost any other sport , kite flying involves no standardized equipment or rules ; it appeals equally to the mystic and the scientist , the fresh-air buff and the do-it-yourselfer who devises and builds his own bird of balsam and plastic .
