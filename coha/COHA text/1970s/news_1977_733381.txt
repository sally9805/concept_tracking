txt WARREN THUNDER was n't fighting just for the money , the $100 he 'd get for going into the ring . He was fighting for more than that , for a beginning . He 'd just turned pro three months ago . This would be his second pro fight . He 'd been working out every day for it . Up every morning at 9:45 a.m. to run in the dark before he left his sleeping wife and kids for his job at the factory . Straight home after work , then over to the Hamlin Park gym until 8 p.m . In bed by 10 . No smoking . No drinking . Ile was strict about those things . THIS FIGHT , Tuesday night , was a chance for a beginning . Another step toward that elusive thing called glory . And so while tile lights of the Aragon burned bright outside , beckoning to the steam of men flocking toward it , WarClose-up With Anne Keegan ren Thunder , the Indian fighter , the kid who had polio that once crippled one leg , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd weighed in at 147 ? welterweight . And he 'd be fighting four rounds as a beginning pro . His was the second fight on the bill . A trainer named Carlo Serie had vol .. unteered to work his corner this night because Thunder had no one . " And , " said Carlo , " I like the kid . He 's got guts and a lot of heart . " THUNDER CAME Into the ring in his black robe with an Indian chief 's head pictured on the back . The minute the bell sounded , he and a boxer named Floyd Pearson went at it . The crowd loved it . That 's what they 'd come for . It was a night away from the wife and from television . A chance to make some noise , drink some booze , and see some action . The two welterweights gave it to them . And when the first round ended , people were on their feet . It was the only standing ovation that night . Carlo jumped into the ring , coiled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunder , sponging him , talking to him . Thunder had taken a lot of punches in the face . HE WANTED Thunder to stay In closer . Pearson had a longer arm , a longer punch . He wanted Thunder to stay in closer so the other guy could n't deliver . The bell . And the two went at it again , slamming each other , pummeling each other . They are welterweights and they move fast . There was none of the bumping and clinging and slow motion of the heavyweight fights to come . Suddenly Thunder 's nose was bleeding , red oozing slowly from his nostrils . And then Pearson connected and Thunder was down , his face on the ropes , one arm pulling himself up . He waited while the referee counted , and at five he staggered up . He was on his feet and he shook his head ? clearing it from the blow . THE REF SAW it and shook his head , too . And called the fight . The crowd booed . Thunder shook his head again ? this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a technical knockout . And for Thunder , the night was over . He 'd lost his second pro fight . But he 'd gained a trainer . Carlo liked him and wants to work with him . " The kid 's got courage , " Carlo said . " lie 's got guts . He does n't quit . In Hill business you got two things . You got boxers and you got fighters . " A BOXER is like All  --  a guy who runs and sticks and moves .. Thunder , he 's a fighter  --  a guy who stays on you all the time . Thunder 's just beginning . lie 's just coming up . " So he lost one . Boxing is a rough business . Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you . But give him six months and when I get through with him , this old Thunder is going to lie dangerous . " " 1 do n't really know why I keep boxing , " Thunder said . " Except I love it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casper Trainer Carlo Sarlo ties Warren Thunder 's gloves before a fight in the Aragon . " I grew up with seven brothers on the reservation , " says Thunder . " And with all those brothers you have to learn to fight . When they went to the gym , I went too . " He went the distance - to a new beginning // grew up with seven brothers on the reservation , and with all those brothers you have to learn to fight . When they went to the gym , I went too . " He went despite the polio that at the age of 2 made one leg smaller than the other . But he kept up with his brothers . And ran for miles on the trails through the woods , building his leg up . " WHEN WE moved to Chicago to live I started boxing with my brother Vaughn , " he said . " We heard about the CYO , and we took the bus to the gym . But it was too far for us . " So we put a punching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I won my first CYO fight and so did my brother . So we had to fight each other . " We met in the ring and he said , ' Well , do you want to fight and give them a show or do you want to toss a coin ? ' I said , ' Let 's fight and give them a show . ' " " I 've been doing that now for 10 Close-up years . I 'm 26 now . And I feel good boxing . One year I stopped and I did n't feel good until I got back in the ring . I 'd do it even if there was n't any money in it , " Thunder said . " Bur THERE 'S always that hope you might make it big . There 's the glory maybe . But there 's the fight . I like it . ' When I get in the ring I block out everything . All I hear is my wife 's voice . It 's like I zoom in on her somewhere out there yelling , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to box some more . I 'm going to fight until they drag me outta the ring . " Warren Thunder , Indian fighter , did n't win his second fight . But then he was fighting for more than just money . He was fighting for a beginning . And he got that .
