Minutes away from the Gulf of Mexico , on the manicured grounds of the Ringling Museums sits a theater unique in all of North America . The Asolo ( pronounced Ahs-olo ) is an 18th century Italian wooden court theater , transported board by board in 1951 from the Old World to the New . Elegant , intimate , enchanting , with a triple tier of embossed balconies , the Asolo was the great Duse 's home theater , and playgoers of a bygone day included Chopin , George Sand and Robert Browning . <P> During the past few years , under enterprising and dedicated leadership , Asolo has achieved full professional status . Unlike most U.S. regional theaters , Asolo operates on a genuine rotating-repertory basis , and with 94% of its 322 seats sold for the season , the only problem for a Sarasota visitor is how to get in . Some current offerings : <P> Going Ape by Nick Hall . Five doors do not a Feydeau farce make . But in this world premire , Playwright Nick Hall , 30 , must be credited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stuck more tenaciously to the great French farceur and depended less on college humor and parodies of old ' 40s movies . However , Going Ape is truly zany . The hero , Rupert Yaeggi ( Dennis Michaels ) , is a kind of Candide in reverse . He has decided that this is the worst of all possible worlds , and he has opted to commit suicide . <P> This proves to be no easy matter . For one thing , Rupert is constantly attended by a delectable nurse , Miss Deaton ( Pamela Lewis ) , to whose charms he seems immune but to whose weird logic he succumbs . No suicide till the plumber comes to fix the hot water , she tells him . But he does n't intend to scald himself to death , he argues . Non sequitur follows non sequitur . A trio of international jewel thieves arrives , but they also do quick-change sequences as Indian priests , complete with cobra and waxwork replicas of Captain Blood , Buffalo Bill and Marie Antoinette . As may be guessed , a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is infectious , and at play 's end Rupert is too pooped to take his own life . <P> The New York Idea by Langdon Mitchell . Though this comedy of manners was first presented in 1906 , it is by no means spavined with age . It is the genre itself that has disappeared . We have grown accustomed to situation comedy , sight-and-gag comedy and black comedy . But the last instance of a social comedy based on an assured upper class was probably Clare Boothe Luce 's The Women , and that play is now 40 years old . Essentially , the New York idea is divorce and , slightly more scandalously , the notion that divorced couples can be amiable friends . <P> Cynthia Karslake ( Pamela Lewis ) and Vida Phillimore ( Barbara Reid ) are the gay divorcees . Cynthia has become engaged to the ex-Mr . Phillimore ( Kelly Fitzpatrick ) , and Vida is on the prowl for the ex-Mr . Karslake ( Steven Ryan ) . What ensues is a flirtatious game of verbal Ping Pong and musical beds . The Asolo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idea , but perhaps an extra bow should go to Pamela Lewis as a sportive Cressida of the drawing room and the racing paddock .
