For former Oriole Superstar Frank Robinson , who is now with the California Angels , the return to Baltimore 's Memorial Stadium for the first time in two years was something of a homecoming . Less than two miles away , however , Johns Hopkins University was host to Navy in another homecoming game that outdrew the Orioles at the gate- 8,200 fans to 7,177 . Robby and the Orioles need not have felt slighted . The big campus contest was nothing so mundane as baseball . It was America 's oldest organized sport : lacrosse . <P> Ever since the ancient Indian game was introduced in Baltimore , it has been as much a local institution as crab cakes and H.L. Mencken . Each spring the city 's schoolboys break out their lacrosse sticks the way kids in other cities limber up with Louisville Sluggers . At Johns Hopkins , foremost of the more than 100 U.S. colleges now competing in the sport , lacrosse is the No. 1 athletic attraction , drawing twice as many spectators as football and basketball combined . Thus it is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the N.C.A.A tournament this week with a strong chance of winning their 30th national lacrosse title . <P> Lacrosse , as one aficionado puts it , is " basketball played on a football field with a club and a slow whistle . " The ten-man teams are constantly on the move , passing and catching the hard rubber ball in the triangular nylon net at the end of their sticks . The game puts a premium on speed , deception and the kind of guts it takes to run a gauntlet of flying sticks and wing the ball at the 6-ft. - sq. goal at 100 m.p.h . <P> The modern version of the game follows the spirit if not the rules of the old tribal pastime . Called lacrosse by French missionaries because the curved hickory sticks reminded them of a bishop 's crosier , the game as played by Iroquois braves or Blue Jay undergrads is more riot than religious rite . Civilization and 300 years have brought such refinements as helmets and shoulder pads . Even so , the basic game plan still holds that the next best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . Johns Hopkins Coach Bob Scott , a former Army ranger , says that football has its more jarring moments but that " lacrosse is rougher than any other sport , including hockey . " <P> At most Johns Hopkins ' homecomings , the old grads gather in the Lacrosse Hall of Fame , which is attached to the fieldhouse , guzzle National Bohemian beer and reminisce about the glory years , like 1932 when the Blue Jays won the Olympic lacrosse title in Los Angeles before a throng of 80,000 . The beer was flowing as usual this year , but the talk was about Junior Jack Thomas , an All-America who is considered the school 's most explosive scorer since Assistant Coach Joe Cowan starred for the old blue and black in the late 1960s.
