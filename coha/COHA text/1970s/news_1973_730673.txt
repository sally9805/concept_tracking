txt The U S Government is about to require that unsafe baby cribs be banned from the marketplace . The action will come in the form of a directive from the Food and Drug Administration setting a number of safety standards for cribs , including the crucial one : a narrower distance between vertical slats on crib sides . The action , soon to be announced , comes in the wake of prodding by Sen. Charles H. Percy ( R ) of Illinois and after stories about unsafe cribs appeared in a number of newspapers , including this one . The principal safety problem has been that there is too much space between the vertical side slats of some cribs , which permits infants ' bodies to slip through . Because heads can not slip through , however , strangulation can result . Problem identified The problem first was identified in 19'ai ny the National Product Safety Commission , which estimated that 200 infants are killed by strangulation each year due to unsafe crib design . The commission labeled unsafe wooden cribs one of 16 unreasonable household hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years to require that all cribs be safely designed and made . The FDA is circulating a draft of its proposed cribs safety standards : It is expected to be made public in a few weeks , The draft sets the maximum distance between slats at 21/4 inches ? the distance recommended by FDA 's bureau of child safety . If the FDA follows Its recent procedures , the mandatory safety standards may be in effect within a few months . In the opinion of consumer advocates , leaving the problem for the baby-furniture industry to solve has not worked . That is why Senator Percy prodded the FDA earlier this year in search of government action . Following the product safety commission 's report in 1970 , industry representatives agreed on a voluntary standard of 314 inches between side slats . But by the FDA 's count , 15 percent of cribs subsequently made did not conform to this standard . Additionally , an aide to Senator Percy spot checked cribs in several Washington area stores recently and found that about 50 percent did not conform to this voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards . He was concerned that crib-safety issue might languish for several years while the new Product Safety Agency was becoming acquainted with this and other consumer issues . Established by Congress last year , the new agency this spring is to assume responsibility for crib safety and other product safety issues . Senator Percy has received a return letter from the FDA explaining that data received from several surveys and studies now " have provided us with appropriate technical data to develop meaningful safety requirements for cribs , " The FDA letter concludes , " We believe the Food and Drug Administration is moving as rapidly as possible to develop comprehensive safety requirements for cribs " *Pleitse turn to Page 12 *Baby-crib rules // However , sources insist it was the Percy letter and the press stories that prodded the FDA into prompt action . According to one informed estimate , the FDA action probably was speeded up by two or three years . The proposed FDA standard for slat spacing of 21/ inches is stiffer than even consumer advocates had hoped for . If that is the final standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed , the FDA standard would govern a number of other safety areas . Among other things it would require that there be no splintered wooden areas ; no sharp hardware ; no toys , decorations , or other attachments that do not meet federal safety standards . And there is good news for perspiring fathers charged with assembling cribs . Under the proposed standards , each packaged crib must contain assembly instructions , parts , drawings , and specification .
