THE EDUCATION OF EDWARD KENNEDY by BURTON HERSH 510 pages . Morrow . $10.95 . <P> In a campaign year cluttered with political biographies , as well as rehashes of the Kennedy years , this overweight volume might have been passed by . But the clawing among Democratic candidates for the presidency , and then the shooting of Governor Wallace , have brought the Kennedy tragedy to mind , along with the role that Edward Kennedy may yet play at next month 's convention . <P> The author , a sometime novelist and freelancer , is unusually sensitive about both the Senator 's political and personal history . He is also a rather flamboyantly bad writer , a reporter who demands equal time for his metaphors and his research . He uses unprecedented candor in dealing with his vulnerable subject , going into Kennedy 's drinking and domestic troubles along with his congressional achievements . For his part , the Senator cooperated , granting access to his office and his friends-a course of action that in the long run will probably be no more politically damaging than diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally agreed that the post-Chappaquiddick Edward Kennedy is an even more effective and increasingly powerful Senate liberal . He is also conceded to be the best natural politician of the whole remarkable clan-less remote than Jack , far less abrasive than Bobby , and with an unfettered , spontaneous brio all his own . Hersh quotes a family friend as saying that Jack " went weak with pleasure " watching his young brother press flesh with the public . <P> Ted 's political lessons were learned in Jack 's campaigns , and later in his own quest for a Massachusetts Senate seat . Hersh savors the local pols who were momentarily crucial to Kennedy . Their quaint political world was to achieve national prominence during the Senator 's unfortunate 1964 attempt to get Family Retainer Francis X. Morrissey confirmed as a federal judge . That whole public pratfall-the admission of double legal residences and nonexistent law courses-is played out here , but Hersh can offer no real explanation for it beyond misplaced family piety . <P> Indeed , Ted Kennedy 's story sometimes seems to be a race between slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it fell to Ted to tell their paralyzed father . It took him a day to bring himself to do it , as it did later to report the accident at Chappaquiddick . The most crushing tragedy , of course , was Robert Kennedy 's death . Hersh points to the " strain of rather unusual male tenderness , a kind of unabashed motherliness that crops up among Kennedy men . " As the youngest child , Ted loved " high jinks and excited fun and a good many drinks sometimes . " His secretary notes that the long hospital stay after his own near-fatal plane crash was the first time in his life that Ted was truly alone .
