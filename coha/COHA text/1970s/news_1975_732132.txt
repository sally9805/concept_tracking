txt America 's hamburgers to be cooked by the sun ? Solar heat collectors sprouting from the roofs of America 's fast-food chains ? Not yet ? but maybe . One fast-food chain ? Burger King Corporation ? has just broken ground in New Jersey for an experimental **25;1326;TOOLONG restaurant which will get much of its heat from solar collectors on the roof It will also have a system designed to recycle waste heat from its broilers . The chain is trying to hold down energy costs . If it succeeds , and other food chains follow suit , it could provide the kind of large market for solar energy that might bring costs down and bring them within reach of the average homeowner . Ground was broken in Voorhees Township New Jersey , this month for an experimental Burger King , equipped with solar energy collectors which track the sun across the sky and a " scavenging " system designed to recover waste heat from the burger broiler. // ? *Sunburgers ' coming ? L'ontinued from Page 1 " America can no longer function on the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennet , the comp ? ny 's vice-president of engineering . He readily admits that the wealth which has increasingly been slipping out of Burger King 's hands into the profits of the oil companies was a key factor in the decision to try sun power . His company estimates that their energy costs will increase by 20 percent this year alone . The experimental restaurant will cost 30 percent more than the average to build but " it is expected that the extra cost of energy-related equipment will be justified if current trends continue . " The solar collectors are of a fairly sophisticated design , intended to provide the energy for heating during the winter and air-conditioning in the summer . In addition , about half the waste heat from the broiler will be recycled . Today there are over 16,000 fast food outlets in America . Marketing analyses have indicated that this may grow to 25,000 by 1979 . If the combination solar energy and heat ? recycling systems cuts operating costs significantly , solar collectors could begin appearing between McDonald 's golden arches or next to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might be possible to buy a " sun burger " broiled in a solar oven and wrapped in recycled aluminum foil .
