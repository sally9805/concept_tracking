&gt; When student tuition-loan programs began expanding during the 1960s , they seemed a sensible solution to the problem of soaring education costs . The loans , backed by state and federal authorities but issued by private institutions at 7% interest , came due within a year after the student left school and were repayable within ten years . Now , to the dismay of financial authorities , the delinquency rate is soaring ( as high as 9% in the case of one major bank , compared with a standard adult rate of only 2% ) . The reasons most commonly cited : jobs are hard to find , and some students are simply loath to work or to pay debts . To track down delinquents , the Department of Health , Education and Welfare has assigned 58 new sleuths , but some culprits may be hard to find . When the Bank of America prodded one ex-student about laggardly payments , all it got in reply was a photo of him huddled naked in some northern cave . <P> &gt; Given a little time to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the average Princeton man , ten years out of college , would earn more than $20,000 , prefer Marlboros ( if he smokes ) , German cars and Jack Daniel 's , live in a colonial home decorated in contemporary style , wear his hair longer than he used to , and choose Richard Nixon over any Democrat. * He might even guess that 41% of Princeton 's class of 1962 have tried drugs , or that 24% have tried extramarital sex-all deductions confirmed in a ten-years-later booklet just issued by the class . Who would imagine , though , that the average member of the class of 1962 is able to attend only 0.5 Tiger football games a year ? <P> &gt; Pleasant surprises are nice , particularly if they apply to national disaster areas such as reading ability , and a " pleasant surprise " was just what Dr. J. Stanley Ahmann of the National Assessment of Educational Progress reported after he glanced over the results of his group 's federally financed $15 million effort to test how well U.S. youngsters can read . There was some doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider , for example , this question for nine-year-olds : " Complete the sentence with the words that make the most sense : The boy wanted ( a ) a new ball ( b ) under dinner ( c ) rode his bike ( d ) to the circus ( e ) stopped raining ( f ) I do n't know . " Some 17 % missed it . Sniffed Dr. William Furlong of the National Reading Center : " The questions may tell us more about the testers ' expectations than the kids ' ability to read . " <P> * And prefer TIME to any other magazine ( 45% ) .
