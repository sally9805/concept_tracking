of the one generally heard around the present White House : " Anything will work if the President wants it to work ? if he insists on it working . In my judgment , however , OMB has such a strong responsibility to control the spending of money that it 's not in the best position to make a final presentation of a matter to the President . Its responsibility to keep spending down and income up is so dominant that there has to be somebody else , some other staff , to look at all the other aspects of programs and proposals that require money . " One of many related questions is whether any President nowadays can do without a chief of staff , regardless of whether he uses that name for the function . A Carter associate who thinks a President can is Matthew Coffey , one of the President-elect 's chief talent hunters . Coffey , who was Lyndon Johnson 's deputy personnel director , argued for a greatly reduced and simplified White House staff in a memorandum to Carter last June . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chief of staff is a terribly effective way to do it . It gives a President the opportunity to stand back , view things for himself , make up his own mind . The other way , everything comes to the President through a filter , and that filter by its very existence tends to control and screen the information that gets to the President . " Gerald Ford , a simple man with a natural preference for simple procedures , refused for a while to call Donald Rumsfeld a chief of staff and insisted on styling him a coordinator . Mr. Ford at length realized that he had to have somebody to track what his other assistants were doing and that Rumsfeld in fulfilling that function was in fact the President 's staff chief , as Cheney is now . President Carter may be expected to come around to it , too . I went one evening recently to the National Archives in Washington to hear a lecture by John Toland , the author of the much-publicized book , Adolf Hitler . When I find myself at such occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there : since I am not sure why I have gone , I study their faces and dress to try to understand why they have come . One of the answers that I found by the end of the evening was disconcerting , even if not unexpected . Although I have glanced through it , read some of the reviews , and heard several people talk about it , I have not read Toland 's book . But it is not the book I am discussing . It is the evening at the National Archives , and what he said during it . After all , the subject of Adolf Hitler is of some importance ; and it is also important how the image of him in the popular mind is created , a generation after his death . According to his record , and by his own admission , Toland has had no training as a historian . I hoped to hear from his lecture why we should trust his picture of Hitler , and this indeed was what he chose to discuss . He was introduced by an unnamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly men and women who seem naturally bent to be theadministrators of the cultural institutions of the state . We were told that Toland is a " historian-reporter . " It is necessary to create such a hybrid , of course , only because Toland can not be introduced as a historian . Whether he is a reporter is also open to question , but perhaps not so pressing a concern . We were then told that the historians proper might question ? as some already have ? the validity of Toland 's methods ; and we were told this , of course , with a dismissive sneer at the historians . What fuddy-duddies that they should care about the standards of their discipline ! What cur ? mudgeons that they should insist on the observance of certain rules in the sifting and weighing of evidence ! Was I really hearing this concession to vulgarity in the National Archives ? Toland rose , the stage left to him . He is engaging in a way : a member of the genteel classes who has fallen on good times . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual in such a place , but on seeing our faces he had decided that this was not required , and he could be more familiar and anecdotal . I took this as an insult , but the rest of the audience did not stir . He then said that he had not been trained as a historian , but had " sort of backed into history ; " and with that he began the story of his life at much the same length if not with the same gripping mastery as Edward Gibbon in his autobiography . To cut a long story short ? which he no more did in his lecture than he has done in his book ? the " first two million words " that he wrote in his life ( stories and novels and plays ) were not published . He then turned to what he calls history , because he did not have to " make up a plot : " the plot was ready-made for him . At this moment , I thought of the dramatic moment when Gibbon determined to write The Decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a ready-made plot he had suddenly come across ; he had made up the plot , and it seized him . A man who " backed into history " because he did not have to " make up a plot , " is a man who has not the slightest idea what history is . As he spoke , I began to smell the charlatan ? on stage in the National Archives . All of this has to do with the kind of picture Toland gives us of Adolf Hitler , and how far we can trust it . The contemporary English philosopher , Michael Oakeshott , has said that " the only makers of history are the writers of it . " We know very little about what happened in the past ; we even know very little of what happened yesterday ; and perhaps least of all do we know much about what happened the day before yesterday , the kind of time-span within which Toland works . All that we know of the past , distant or immediate , even of yesterday , are a few records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doings and sayings of a few people . The rest has vanished . The historian must therefore make up the story of the past ; he must invent the plot . In inventing that plot , he must be true to all the facts that are available to him , and to his own perception of them ; he must not bend the facts . And , since he is making up the plot , it is all the more important that he should be held to the strictest methods of collecting and examining the documents and other testimony on which he must rely , and of selecting those which he will put in evidence , even those that obstinately resist his own thesis . That is really what the academic discipline of history is ? or should be . By his own account of his own methods , Toland is not inclined to observe much strictness in the collection and examination and selection of his evidence . Remember that he has taken as his subject one of the most fearful men who has ever held the apparatus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pursued ambitions that must threaten the very existence of civilized life : a man of whom poets such as Dante or Milton might have foreborne to write , and Gibbon might have said that there was nothing much yet for the historian to discern . I am not saying that this need have stopped Toland from his exercise , or even that there is not material in his book that is useful , but merely that we must be cautious of the picture that he gives . He has boasted , his publishers have boasted , that he talked to 250 eye witnesses . Good for Mr. Toland ! But this kind of claim is meaningless . Perhaps if he had interviewed 251 , the evidence of the previous 250 would have been blown out of the water . But during his lecture he produced another figure that multiplied my suspicion . He said that he had taken evidence from 125 of the people " closest to Hitler . " ( Notice the rounded figures : he talked to 250 people altogether , and exactly half of these were among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uttered the figure , my mind reeled . There simply are not 125 people " closest " to any man , especially to one in Hitler 's position . There were n't 125 people " closest " to Moses , or to Nero , or to Genghis Kahn , or to Catherine the Great , or to Napoleon , or to Franklin Roosevelt , and there were not 125 " closest " to Hitler . Moreover , many of those who were indeed " closest " to Hitler are now dead , and have been for some time , beyond the techniques of what is today called " oral history . " So he went on , talking about the rag-tag-and-bobtail of the " eye witnesses " he interviewed ? most of them people who shared Hitler 's guilt with him ? and I only sat up again when he said that he had tracked down ? in Baltimore I think it was ? the reports of an American agent describing his conversations with Hitler 's sister . Such precious evidence , said Toland ; and the audience oohed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction . But most people would surely look with extreme suspicion at a report from any secret agent describing his conversations with Hitler 's sister . Agents have a way of making up stories to please their masters , like Our Man in Havana . They discover secret weapons that do not exist , report contacts that they have not made , and invent important people who do not exist . " Not many people even know that Hitler had a sister , " Toland said blithely . Well , damn it ! perhaps history so far has been right , and she did not really exist as a person who is historically significant , or whose opinions are worth hearing . If she was so much out of the limelight that " not many people know that Hitler had a sister , " then one can well imagine how she might have made up marvellous stories when at last an agent showed an interest in her . The man who introduced Toland said that he had a way of going to sources that others had not thought of . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the sources are . It reminds me of a wine-tasting , to which I went in Washington a few years ago , of " some lesser known wines of Burgundy . " Three friends and I went from vintage to vintage until , when we left , we all said together that now we knew why they were the " lesser-known wines of Burgundy . " I feel much the same about many of Toland 's " eye witnesses . " Eye witnesses of what , anyhow ? In the preface to his book , he lists among those whom he interviewed , not only men such as Speer and Manstein and DOnitz , but Hitler 's secretaries , his chauffeur , and his pilot . One has to ask : what is their evidence worth ? A chauffeur may observe certain kinds of behavior of his employer in the back of the car ; he has no way of placing that behavior in a more than superficial context . Secretaries are not often the most reliable observers of their bosses . So one could go on . Judging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by SS Colonel Otto Skorzeny , a devoted executor of Hitler 's will to the end , and still a faithful admirer of his fithrer . " I liked him , " said Toland gaily , " I liked him for that . " But then many of those he interviewed were unquestioning doers of Hitler 's command ; and I could not help feeling , as he lectured , that it was like asking Dick Swiveller for an unprejudiced account of the character of Fagin . Or again , he made much in his lecture of Hitler 's relations with Ramon Serrano Surier , the Minister of Interior for Franco ; but as he listed some of the testimony that supported his interpretaion of that relationship , he dropped the name of Samuel Hoare , the British ambassador to Spain during the war . Now , there is no doubt that Hoare did a good job in helping keep Spain from joining Hitler ; but no one whom I know who has seriously studied that period would be inclined to take the evidence of Hoare ? co-author of the Hoare-Laval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Ethiopia ? without submitting it to the severest cross-examination . The character of the evidence is vital , because Toland said more than once during the evening that his purpose was to get away from the picture of Hitler as a " monster , " and to show that he was a human being " like the rest of us " , and as a human being was capable of " these things . " What things ? Toland talked mostly of the Final Solution , and he implied , to the point at which it was all but explicit , that Hitler 's real guilt was merely that he had carried out what many of us have imagined in our own hearts . But this is false . It is not merely that most of us do not have the power to execute a Final Solution ; most of us are incapable of imagining a Final Solution as something that a moral being would carry out , even if we had the power . When one talks of Hitler as evil , as apart from the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but of what he was capable of imagining . There is one girl in the Charles Manson story , as it is given in Helter Skelter , who was as much under Manson 's spell as the others , but who refused his ultimate demand : she would not kill for him . Precisely because she also was weak and corruptible , she stands out in the end as a triumphant human being , unable to imagine herself killing as Manson wished her to kill . The whole effect of Toland 's thesis is to deny what was still human in her ; and no amount of psychological explanation or personal history can explain the others and diminish her individual moral resource . In answer to questions , Toland twice turned aside puzzled inquiries about the possibility that " evil incarnate " sometimes walks the earth . " I do n't know what ' incarnate ' means , " he said glibly . " Next ques ? tion . " Most of the questions were appeals for titillation , for snippets about Hitler 's private life , his sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the audience had been found : human atrocity was being reduced to the level of lascivious tittle-tattle . He also turned aside a question about the state of mind of the German people at the time . Yet to separate Hitler from the economic , social and cultural condition of the German people is not only absurd , it is unhistorical . He had material on which to work . When someone asked about the anti-Semitism of the Ger ? mans , he again gave an answer which made me draw my breath : an almost flip suggestion that anti-Semitism in the mind did not matter if it was not translated into deeds . As in his book , Toland suggested that some of the methods of the Final Solution had been inspired by the American treatment of the Indians ; and by the British , he went on ; and did I really here him say , by the Chinese ? What all of that is meant to prove , one does not know . To be inspired by earlier evil is not a justification of carrying it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in someone who purports to be writing history to equate ? or seem to equate ? Adolf Hitler with General Custer , Auschwitz with Wounded Knee . And a young man in the audience , whose question identified him as a Nazi , found comfort in what he heard . During the late 1960s that sensitive writer , Renata Adler , complained that all the evil things that men do were being reduced in our discussion of them to the single level of atrocity ; and if we went on doing this , she said , our moral sense would be finally atrophied . She was right . To talk of the American intervention in Vietnam as genocide was a shoddy trivialization . But Toland was doing much the same , in a different way . Actual atrocity , and the willingness of an entire people to acquiesce in it , were being exorcised . I came out of the lecture , and went with a friend to Blues Alley , to eat and drink , and to listen to its jazz ; and why not eat , drink , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the very soul of this century has been waved away as with a wand ? At 1 a.m. , we left the jazz and drove round Washington , with the top open . There was the Capitol gleaming on its Hill ; there were the monuments to Washington , to Lincoln , to Jeffer ? son . There was a city whose population is 80 percent black , and whatever the indecencies perpetrated against the blacks in 200 years , the Final Solution had never been contemplated . It was not even contemplated in the case of the Indians , whose virtual extermination was the result largely of terrible improvisations , rather than of settled purpose . Why should we tolerate the equation of Hitler with the rest of us , and of nations that have grown morally slack with nations that manage to remain morally alert ? This may not have been Toland 's intention ; he seems a decent enough hack . But it is the inevitable conse ? quence of his methods and his lack of understanding of what he does . For listen to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecture . " My book has no thesis , " he says , and quotes one of Graham Greene 's characters : " The greatest saints have been men with a normal capacity for evil , and the most vicious men have sometimes narrowly evaded sanctity . " Toland then sums up Hitler for us : " Deprived of heaven , Adolf Hitler chose hell ? if , indeed , he knew the difference between the two . To the end , obsessed by his dream of cleansing Europe of Jews , he remained a Knight of the Hakenkreuz , a warped archangel , a hybrid of Prometheus and Lucifer . " This is bunk , it is dangerous bunk , and it is perverse . It is also a thesis , whatever Toland 's disclaimer , as vulgar as one would expect from someone who takes Graham Greene as his moral counsellor . We are all agreed that the time has come for a fresh start in our national life . The task I have set myself on this occasion , which I hope will mark that start , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable , or even requisite , in inaugural addresses . I shall not speak of sacrifice , pride , decency , honor , courage ? though we shall need all of those treasures in plenty . I have looked back to find the reasons for the need for national renewal . I have searched the administrations of my predecessors , not for political blunders , not for failures , not for crimes , but for moments of desperate honesty that by their very intensity might give clues to our need . One such moment haunts me . Honesty from Presidents is more apt to be heard at the end than at the beginning of their terms , and it was just before the expiration of Dwight Eisenhower 's time in office when he uttered a warning that was most surprising , coming from him . In his farewell TV and radio address to the American people , President Eisenhower said , " In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of John Hersey 's most recent book is My Petition for More Space ( Knopf ) . unwarranted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex . . . . We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes . . . . " The more I have thought about this warning ? so uncharacteristic of that dull , fair-minded President ? the louder it has sounded in my ears . It was like a wild cry of pain , for he was a lifetime soldier , a golf and bridge crony of powerful businessmen , a Republican not famous for startling and unorthodox insights . The danger must have stared him in the eye so starkly that he was forced to blurt out the alarm . The course our history has taken since that time shows , alas , that the warning has not been adequately heeded . The Bay of Pigs , the Cuban missile crisis , the great bog of Vietnam , the struggles in the Middle East , and two administrations that have been , to say the least , business-oriented have led to just what Eisenhower feared ? the domination of our polity by the web of forces he had had to deal with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , president of General Motors , was widely misquoted as having said , in testimony before a Senate committee holding a closed confirmation hearing on his appointment as
