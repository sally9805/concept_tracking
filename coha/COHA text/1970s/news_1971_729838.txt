txt A deadlock over foreign aid , the last major obstacle to adjournment , . was broken today as Congressional leaders agreed to bypass a Senate amend'went on , the withdrawal of American troops from Viet , narn . ? Under the : plan worked ? Otit by Democratic and Republican leaders , : Congress , instead of passing a foreign aid bill , will put through a stopgap resolution permitting spending for foreign economic and military assistance tog continue at an annual rate of about $2.6-billion until March 15 . With the agreement , it appeared that the first session of the 92d Congress could adjourn as early as next Monday , although it will more likely be Tuesday or Wednesday before all , legislative business can be completed. : Pressure Front Wives Privately , some members con fessed that they were under pressure from their wives to remain in town until Wednesday so that they could attend White House Christmas receptions that President Nixon has arranged for the first three days of next week . As Congress began clearing its legislative calendar for adjournment , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ override President Nixon 's veto of a bill that would have provided a vast network of day care centers and other . services for the nation 's children . The vote , 51 to 36 , fell 7 short of the two-thirds required to override a veto . The veto was Mr. Nixon 's ninthall of them on domestic measures  --  and was the seventh to be sustained . ( iThe Senate passed and sent to the White House legislation authorizing $1.6-billion over the next three years for an expanded research attack on cancer . The Senate also passed and sent to the House legislation authorizing $142-million over the next three years for dental care for children . 9The House passed legislation extending the President 's authority to control wages and prices for one year , until April 30 , 1973 , The bill , an essential element in President Nixon 's economic stabilization program , now goes to a SenateHouse conference to resolve differences between it and a Senate version . 11The Senate passed and sent to the White House a supplemental appropriation bill providing $3,4-billion for various Government agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling on spending , had become deadlocked between the House and the Senate over an amendment , sponsored by Mike Mansfield , Democrat of Montana , the Senate majority leader . The amendment would have established as national policy the total withdrawal of American forces from Indochina in six months , contingent only upon the release of American prisoners of war , In a House-Senate conference committee , House conferees had refused to yield to Senator Mansfield 's demand that an up-or-down vote on his amendment be permitted in the House . In return , the Senate leadership , in the absence of an authorization bill , refused to permit a Senate vote on a House-passed foreign aid appropriation bill , which provides the money for the programs . At a meeting this morning called by Hugh Scott , Republican of Pennsylvania , the Senate minority floor leader , House and Senate leaders decided , over Senator Mansfield 's continuing opposition , to bypass the Vietnam issue . Programs Continued Instead of either an authorization or appropriation bill for the current fiscal year , which , ends next June 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably on Monday , would pass a so-called continuing resolution permitting foreign aid spending until March 15 at about the ' same rate as last year , The resolution would also contain authority to provide military credits to Israel ' for the purchase of weapons , including Phantom jet fighters . The decision was a rebuff to the Senate , and in particular its majority leader , in its efforts to assert a role in the formulation of foreign policy . It was a victory for the Administration and the House in the intense maneuverings that have developed since the Senate over a month ago first killed and then revived the foreign aid bill . In effect , the Administration got several hundred million dollars more . for foreign aid than it would have if an appriation bill had been passed . The $2.6-billion rate is about $900-million less than the amount requested by the Administration , but with the heavy cuts already approved by a Senate Appropirations subcommittee , it appeared that , at most , any appropriation bill would have provided about $2.2-billion . Restrictions Are Deleted In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments that the Senate wrote into the foreign aid authorization to curb the power of the executive branch . One would have required an nual - authorization of the State ' Department 's budget , thus giving the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee a greater legislative hold over the department . Another , in a novel use of Congressional power over the pursestrings , would have provided that the foreign aid funds could not be spent until the President reH leased various ' funds for domestic programs that he has impounded . In recent days , Senator Mansfield has been urged by some of his colleagues to yield on his Vietnam amendment in order to preserve the other restrictive amendments and ? thus help establish the principle of Congressional co-equality with the executive branch . Compromise Ruled Out But Senator Mansfield , who acknowledges that he has become " somewhat singleminded " on the issue , refused to yield , thus ruling out a compromise with the House . Senator Mansfield 's bargaining position was critically weakened when ? Senator Allen J. Ellender , Democrat of Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave next week on a trip to Antarctica , agreed with House leaders on a continuing resolution to break the impasse . Until that point , Senator Ellender had been declaring his opposition to any more continuing resolutions for the foreign aid program on the ground that they were undercutting the authority of the Senate and its legislative committees . In the leadership meeting , Senator Mansfield continued to express his opposition to a continuing resolution and to renew his demand for a House vote on his Vietnam amendment , which was again rejected by House leaders . But Senator Mansfield made the crucial concession that , he would permit the continuing resolution to be considered by the Senate in the closing hours of the first session . As majoritt leader , he has the right to determine which legislation will be considered . Senator Mansfield later told reporters that he ' regarded the decision as " a rebuff to the Senate " but explained that , because of the ' weary , adjournment-minded mood of Congress , he saw little reason to pursue his fight for the Vietnam amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adjournment pressure to push a continuing resolution through the Senate . Meanwhile , it was apparent that with his veto of the child development program that was sustained today by the Senate , the President had complicated his future relations on domestic issues with the Democraticcontrolled Congress . The acrimony of the debate preceding the vote suggested that he may have imperiled the liberal support he needs for passage of his welfare.reform program , which includes a far more modest child care component . Democrats , in the debate , described his veto action as ' cruel , " " outrageous , " " hysterical , " " illogical , " " capricious , " and " Mickey Mouse . " The criticism was stirred by what the Democrats viewed as an unnecessarily critical veto message in which Mr. Nixon protested what he characterized as " fiscal irresponsibility , administrative unworkability and family-weakening implications " in the bill . The last charge had been emphasized in right-wing literature circulated in recent weeks in opposition to the bill . Senator Gaylord Nelson , Democrat of Wisconsin , angrily accused Mr. Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
