CONVERSATIONS WITH WILLIE by Robin Maugham Simon &; Schuster ; 188 pages ; $10 <P> When he died in 1965 , William Somerset ( Willie ) Maugham was the most famous writer in the world . Eighty million copies of his books had been sold , his plays were performed worldwide , his work had led to several memorable movies , and some 80 of his short stories had been adapted for television . At his famous Villa Mauresque , he employed one of the best cooks on the Riviera , dined off silver plates and entertained royalty . Yet he was miserable . What was wrong ? Everything . Or so this instructive and melancholy memoir by Nephew Robin Maugham would have us believe . <P> " My success means nothing to me , " Willie said not long before he died , in one of the many cries of anguish that fill this book . " All I can think of now are my mistakes . I can think of nothing else but my foolishness ... I wish I 'd never written a single word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The author 's greatest regret was his marriage . The disastrous union had taken place half a century before , to a woman he felt had tricked him into an alliance that violated his basically homosexual nature . " You see , I was a quarter normal and three-quarters queer , but I tried to persuade myself it was the other way round . That was my greatest mistake . It flattered me that Syrie should throw herself at my feet . She told me that she cared for me more than anyone else in the world ... I was so vain and stupid I believed her . . . But she ruined my life . " <P> It is hard to see how . During most of the twelve-year marriage , Maugham was hardly a husband . He was most frequently off with Gerald Haxton , a handsome young American he had met during World War I. Full of charm and liquor , in nearly equal measure , Haxton was difficult but necessary , an ideal complement to Maugham , whose lifelong stutter made him shy and withdrawn . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night drinking with the local planters and lawyers and then repeat their tales to Willie , who would fashion them into stories . When his lover died of tuberculosis in 1944 , Maugham was incurably stricken . " For 30 years he had been my chief care , my pleasure , and my anxiety , " he told Robin . " Without him I am lost and lonely and hopeless ... I am too old to endure so much grief . I have lived too long . " <P> And so he kept saying , on and off , for the next 20 years . He tried to prolong his life with injections of goat hormones , and at the same time lamented his longevity . As he reached toward 90 , Willie was constantly lionized , and he just as constantly complained , " Why ca n't they let me die ? " On one occasion he compared his life to a party . It was " very nice to start with , but has become rather noisy as time has gone on . And I 'm not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , he wrote down his Uncle Willie 's conversations with full knowledge of their historical value , and there is no reason to doubt his accuracy . <P> But there is a reason to doubt Maugham 's own memories , tinctured by old age and ill health . A man as intensely unhappy as he claims to have been when he was 90 or 91 could not have written so much for so long . At the tired end of a long party , it is hard to remember how much pleasure it gave most of the way .
