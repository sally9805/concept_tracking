Chartered helicopters still waited to carry copy to distant printing plants , but those $108-an-hour air taxis were being kept only for emergencies . For the first time since the Washington Post 's pressmen went on strike and sabotaged nine presses early this month ( TIME , Oct. 13 ) , the paper was able to turn out a full 550,000-copy edition in its own plant last week . The pressmen 's walkout has been joined by three other Post unions , but the nation 's eighth largest morning paper seemed to be adjusting to the siege remarkably well . <P> It now is clear that the paper had long been making preparations for a confrontation . Rising labor costs have helped reduce the paper 's share of profits for the Washington Post Co. from 64% in 1970 to 38% in 1974. *Publisher Katharine Graham last year assigned her vice president for finance , Mark Meagher , as general manager of the newspaper , instructing him to restore its sagging fortunes . Says she : " I want to win a Pulitzer Prize for management . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Knight chain , have concentrated their efforts on the Post 's labor costs , which are scheduled to rise by $5 million this year alone . Despite union opposition to labor-saving machinery , the paper bought new photographic composition equipment and began installing it in administrative offices two floors above the pressroom . It also started training about 125 employees to produce the paper during a walkout . Much of that instruction was received at the Newspaper Production and Research Center , an impressively equipped printing school in Oklahoma City supported by the Post and 200 other papers and known among union members as a " school for scabs . " Indeed , the center was organized largely by a newspaper production manager who had driven printing unions from the nearby Daily Oklahoman and Times ( combined circ. 272,177 ) in the 1950s . <P> Doubled Salaries . The Post made certain its unions were aware of these precautions , and last year a union representing 700 typographical workers softened their opposition to automation , allowed the company to begin regular use of photographic composition equipment , and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were not a party to the agreement , the Post wanted to limit the overtime system that enabled some workmen to double their $15,000 base salaries ; the pressmen resisted , their contract expired , and they walked out . <P> The Post does not seem anxious to have them back . Although the strike is costing the paper as much as $100,000 a day in lost advertising and extra logistical expenses , Meagher has been arguing for the company 's " right to publish , " and he plans to file a civil suit for damages against the employees who trashed the presses . Although the American Newspaper Guild is insisting that the editorial employees should join the other unions in supporting the strike , the Post unit of the Guild has voted 270 to 251 not to do so . A number of journalists say they will keep working even if that vote is later reversed .
