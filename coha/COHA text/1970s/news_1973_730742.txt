txt Boycott or no boycott , dollar-a-pound hamburger through mid-July is the outlook for American shoppers . But prices will likely drop this fall . The auctioneer 's chant at Social Circle this week told the same story over and over : Cattle prices , despite a seven-day meat boycott , remain stubbornly high . Cattlemen , buyers , auctioneers , and feed-grain specialists gathered around the semicircular pit of the auction barn at Tri County Livestock Company here predict the first significant price breaks should come in July . By autumn , prices should fall considerably . The U.S. Government , meanwhile , reported that the nation 's economy advanced at a rapid rate of 14.3 percent during the first quarter of the year ? with inflation soaring at a rate of 8 percent . The cattlemen and others also had a message for housewives now talking about a longer , two-week boycott in May . // *Boycott or not , meat supply falls short and prices stay high // Looking at the underfed , bony cattle being prodded across the pit , they asserted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse time for the consumer . A May boycott , for the same reasons , probably would be just as ineffective . Rangers and buyers explain that all winter the cattlemen have been faced with soaring grain prices . Soybean meal rose as high as $260 a ton in Georgia , an 80 percent increase . Some cattlemen just could n't afford it . Their steers and heifers went on a diet of hay , and the herds coming to market now show the effects . Some animals are 200 pounds and more underweight . Now the Georgia hills are blushing with spring , covered with thick , green grass which , without , cost , can add hundreds of pounds to cattle in a few months . So despite high prices , and regardless of consumer boycotts , ranchers are not inclined to part with their herds until mid-summer . By fall ranchers , say the herds will be fattened , cattle will be plentiful , and prices should fall considerably . The decrease could be even greater if feed-prices do not drop , for farmers will not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case . That could result in a real market glut and even lower prices . Oversupply recalled Also forcing prices down will be the normal cycle of cattle supply , with the supply rising as it does every eight years or so . During the most memorable oversupply situation , in 1963-64 , prices for choice steers fell as low as 19 cents a pound . A number of cattlemen were forced out of business . Cattlemen are stung by criticism that they are somehow responsible for the current high prices . " It 's as simple as supply and demand , " says Torn B. Dally , owner of an auction barn . Mr. Dally and others point to a plethora of bad new 's from the farm front , in addition to the foremost factor of feed costs . Weather in the Southwestern U.S has killed more than 350,000 head of cattle in recent weeks . Government price regulations and threats have scared ranchers into withholding some cattle from market . A government crackdown on the growth-encouraging chemical DES in January has reduced meat output 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says cattleman Millard Braswell of Athens , Ga . Without saying whether the government was right or wrong on the DES issue , Mr. Braswell says , it must be recognized that without the chemical , the price of production has gone up . Someone has to pay for that . Nor did the first housewives ' boycott necessarily help the situation , Mr. Braswell notes . The boycott , he says , caused " an overreaction on the producers ' side , " which has helped further tighten supplies . Before the boycott , Mr. Braswell says , We had already entered a period when more cattle would normally'be coming to market . But the boycott plugged the pipelines and caused temporary shortages around the country . ' ' As a result of the first boYcott , Mr. Braswell says that several cattlemen he knows who were expanding production rather rapidly now have stopped . Mr. Dally , the Tri County owner , says the ironic thing about the boycott was that prices had apparently peaked March 1 anyway , a full month before . After than , prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 80 cents to 68 cents ? and have stayed right there so far .
