HOPE AGAINST HOPE by Nadezhda Mandelstam. 431 pages . Afheneum. $10 . <P> <P> " Madness in great ones must not unwatch 'd go , " said Claudius as he sent Polonius to eavesdrop on Hamlet . The prince of petulance had his problems , not the least of which was that he was an excellent poet who could not keep his mouth shut . Compulsively putting the truth into unforgettable images and rhythms is indeed a form of madness that tyrants have always feared . <P> Osip Mandelstam , one of modern Russia 's best poets , was touched with such divine madness . Born in 1891 , he became an Acmeist , one of a group of poets who reacted against the excess vagaries of the Symbolists by celebrating the palpability of things in clear , earthy language . Although the son of a Jewish leather merchant , Mandelstam was most at home in classical Christian humanism . A rose was a rose because of its petals and perfume , not because it stood for something else . <P> And a butcher was a butcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Purge , Mandelstam did a wild and unheard-of thing . He wrote a poem about Stalin , and even read it to a group of literary friends . It began : <P> We live , deaf to the land beneath us , Ten steps away no one hears our speeches . <P> It went on to describe the dictator in images redolent of death , decay and sickness . Stalin 's " fingers are fat as grubs , " his " cockroach whiskers leer , " his laws are like horseshoes to fling " at the head , the eye or the groin . " One version of the poem ended with Stalin savoring every execution like a raspberry . <P> Some poem . Some razzberry . In those days-and for a decade to come-people disappeared forever behind the walls of Moscow 's Lubianka Prison for much less . Inevitably , Stalin heard about Mandelstam 's poem . Yet it was not until 1934 that he had the poet arrested . Even then , it was difficult to do away with a man as acclaimed as Mandelstam . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result was that Mandelstam was released and exiled with his wife to live as best he could in the provinces . For three years , he was officially " isolated but preserved . " Then , in 1938 , at the height of the purges , Mandelstam was rearrested and sent to a labor camp near Vladivostok . He died there at 47 , starved , frozen and justifiably paranoid . <P> Hope Against Hope is Nadezhda Mandelstam 's recollection of the four years during which she and her husband wandered as nonpersons through the small cities and towns of Russia . They were harassed by officials , plagued by spies , kept from steady work and forced to borrow , beg and live in the corners of cold rooms . Their constant companion was the realization that they could be arrested at any time for any reason . " Give us a man and we will make a case " was a big office joke among the secret police .                   @ @
