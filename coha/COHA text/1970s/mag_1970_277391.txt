On Gia Long street in the seamy port of Qui Nhon , South Viet Nam 's third-biggest city , two troopers from the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade halted their three-quarter-ton truck . Whether they stopped to shift their load , as they said , or to grab a beer or a whore , is beside the point . Within minutes , one of a legion of larcenous Vietnamese urchins surrounding the truck had made off with a fire extinguisher . <P> For 15 minutes , the American G.I.s drove around looking for the thief . Then they came roaring back down Gia Long street . A 15-year-old student named Nguyen Van Minh was sitting on a fence outside the Tay Son High School , smoking and reading as he waited for his afternoon classes . From the back of the U.S. truck , a soldier raised his M-16 and sent a rifle shot into the boy 's forehead . Minh slumped forward , the back of his skull blown away . " His brain broke out , " said a stunned eyewitness . <P> Hate-Filled . It should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Minh resulted in two cathartic days of rioting by the hurt , hate-filled Vietnamese . Hostility has long been festering in South Viet Nam , on both sides . The Armed Forces Radio exhorts G.I.s daily not to toss cans at Vietnamese motorists . U.S. officials have never denied the existence of a contingency plan in case the withdrawing Americans have to shoot their way to the beaches through hostile South Vietnamese . <P> After the shooting of Nguyen Van Minh , Vietnamese police and American M.P.s quickly halted the truck involved . Pfc . Matias Yzaguirre Jr. , 22 , a Mexican American from Brownsville , Texas , was sent to the Danang stockade , charged with negligent homicide . Shock among Minh 's schoolmates turned to outrage when U.S. officials insisted that the shooting had been accidental . " It was no accident , " said a witness . " He wanted to shoot the boy . " <P> Before long 1,500 students were demonstrating in the streets of Qui Nhon beneath a quickly scrawled sign in uncertain English : BAD YANKEE GO HOME . The signs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The provincial chief , Colonel Nguyen Mong Hung , urged the students to remember that " without the Americans , you would have no school at all . " But he was hooted down , and the crowd overturned U.S. vehicles and wrecked bars and restaurants frequented by Americans . The demonstrations were finally dampened by drenching rains , a curfew and unsympathetic Vietnamese troops . <P> In Effigy . Among those at Minh 's Buddhist funeral was the senior U.S. civilian adviser , who paid funeral costs , provided vehicles to take the cortege back to Minh 's native village for burial , and paid the family compensation of 100,000 piasters ( $250 ) . Meanwhile in Saigon , 280 miles to the southwest , as many as 600 demonstrators showed their sympathy for the slain boy by donning white mourning headbands and burning President Nixon in effigy .
