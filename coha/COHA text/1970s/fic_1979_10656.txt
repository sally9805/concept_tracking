to heed instantly her call and to accept patiently the short poles at their shoulders . This season she owned five dogs but one will not travel with the family this winter or ever again . A crippling mystery had used up the true-dog , creature-friend of Ahbleza 's boy-seasons . This one 's legs now lacked the strength to carry her across the camp circle and Napewaste had decided to leave her at the warm ashes of the campfire . Ahbleza , hearing , put food and water nearby the dog , and while he avoided touching this pathetic creature , he permitted himself a long look into the dog 's eyes . And looking , he saw more than a dying four-legged friend . This true-dog , his mother 's dog these many winters . But who dares say that he ceases to remember those boy-with-pup seasons ? Who dares say that he will not sense the passing of his youth in this aching moment of letting-go those wonderful boy-seasons of encircling affection ? The creature wobbled onto her legs , her tail starting to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling horse waiting nearby ; he rode off not once looking back . The same morning Ogle sat at the dead ashes of his lodge-fire and cheerfullychided his family . " All of you . . . all daughters-of-the-shell and crawling while different women step lively . Whatever will happen if someday you need break camp before a pursuing enemy ? " But the good-natured hunter will not frighten his wife and daughters and women-relatives into a scurry ; not another tiyospaye owns more robes , more bundles , more things they will pack , more evidence of diligence . And so they stopped to watch Wanagi , who , riding in among the horses and drags , approached Tonweya . " I see a new scout in the tribe , " he called , his voice loud for the relatives ' hearing . " They call this youth truthbearer now , and so each one knows in what manner he protects the people . " " Wahn . " Softly but certainly Tonweya permitted himself the man-sound that acknowledges surprise , wonderful surprise . But why will the wapiya come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacincala , his young sister , began speaking to Cankuna , her phrases directed at Tonweya . " My mother and my sister Cuwe say that these moccasins belong to my brother . " Shyly she made her speech , quickly she put the gift-pairs in Tonweya 's hands . The youth , accepting , saw that all his family now gathered around him . He looked straight forward , but his eyes , in the manner of a scout , observed each one who stood in the little half-circle . " A scout carries wasna when he goes out and so I fill a meat sac for you . " Iku 's wide mouth shaped into a glad smile as he handed his nephew this present . Gnuska , next to approach the youth , offered a single long feather . " Stripp401this one and make yourself a waverer . " The warrior 's oppressive bearing softenedmomentarily and his lips twisted in a small smile . " Ride out , my son , ride out where a scout belongs . " Ogle , his father , had spoken and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that they accept him as scout ? Tonweya 's surprise gave way to joyous wonder . But where , Pasu , the naming-uncle and a most remarkable scout ? And what about different scouts ? Will they also accept him ? He shall find out . Letting go the horse he had intended to ride , Tonweya leaped on the black runner , moving swiftly out onto the plain . This fast one will carry him beyond those many families already on their way , carry him far out in front , where he will find the scouts who look out for the bands . Passing Ahbleza , the new scout raised a hand , his thumb proudly gesturing his good news . But he had not resisted a boylike yell , a joy-filled laugh . Coming abreast the leaders , he saw that Istakpe , the Kiyuksa peaceman who wore an eye patch , carried the fire in a pte-horn . And that at the true front walked those four they call wakicunsa , the deciders . He slowed his horse ; he will ride carefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , who perhaps stop him , send him back . But not a man turned as he went forward . And so he remembered back to the day when he had ridden as an uninvited moccasin-carrier . Why shall they look at someone they know will come along ? He smiled to himself and urged the horse into a run once again . Near the bottom of a butte , Tonweya caught up with the scouts . Now , he told himself , he shall learn whether or not these truthbearers recognize him as one of their own . Here rode the six outstanding scouts in the tribe , in any tribe , a group he will join most proudly . Po and Wasu , immediately front and riding as a pair . Po , who knows many ways to confuse a pursuing enemy ; Po who often acts as decoy . Twice Po prevented an attack on the Mahto camp ; the warriors say so . And Wasu , the big man who on one occasion entered an enemy camp , jumping noisily into the midst of their games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anyone . While taking enemy horses Wasu , they say , makes loud noises with his nose or from his bottom . But in his own village , Wasu remains quiet , never joins in the contests or dances , never calls attention to himself . Also riding as a pair , Pei and Pasu . Pezi , a man not tall , not husky , but hoh , what cunning . His friends say that he will slip into an enemy camp and stay among the lodges ; the enemy never find him . They say he remembers himself as spirit hovering over the enemy camp , discovering that which the enemy intends . Yet a most different man in his own camp ; here he talks and acts rough . Nor will he wear in his own village the bunch of pte-grass , his protecting-mystery , which he ties in his hair whenever he goes out scouting . And now Pasu , the man with a nose similar to the one on a wingfiapper . The bird-with-two-voices often makes crude observation regarding this big/nose  --  or so Pasu tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closeness to pte-pazo , the grasshopper who points out the grazing pte , and his understanding with those wingeds who lead him to the browsing wapiti . Good-natured Pasu ; truly all creatures treat with this man as a relative . And finally those two scouts , brothers they call look-alikes , those two who ride legs touching . Even their names the same : Cekpa . And so they stay together , work together . One will stand on a ledge near an enemy camp pretendingthat he laments , while his brother sneaks down from the ridge , lookingand listening in the shadows of enemy tipi . Tonweya cleared his throat but none of the six turned to see who approached . The next moment Pasu 's thumb gestured an order that obviouslyincluded his nephew Tonweya . And so the youth , in company with the scouts , began riding up the butte . Halfway Pasu halted the group , giving directions . Each man , Tonweya learned , shall stay at an assigned position until the people catch up . Then each one shall move to the lookout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , anyone discovering pte , will send signs , " Pasu instructed . Next , he gave Tonweya his position ; the newcomer shall stay here , the scout Pei on the high point of the same butte . Now Pasu led down the other scouts , Tonweya watching to see where each man turned off . Presently one man rode out of line , going south . This one , Po , the one scout who carried his lance erect , in the manner of a warrior . Next , the twins broke away , going toward the north . Tonweya had recognized the pair easily , a single thick braid hanging down the back of each one , hair too heavy for the wind to lift . Exactly where Wasu turned off and at what place Pasu will locate , Tonweyahad not seen , but something he knew : Mahto scouts protect the moving people front and sides . And guarding their backs , members of the Cante Tinza , the brave-heart lodge , this group riding always at the rear of the line . Tonweya felt grateful toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this butte made him comfortable , similar to the vision-seeking with Ahbleza on the ledge above him . Looking up now , he saw Pezi 's lean body , the man 's dark red form against the white of the cliff and the clear deep of the sky , a magnificence that quickened his pride . Then , looking back onto the plain , he saw the people , a long , colorful stripe meandering across the vastness of summer-weary grass , a tribe who moves as a family toward the sheltering back of a great reclining mound , that which they call the black mountain , the black hills . Here , on separate streams , the bands shall camp this winter , the hills providing water and wind-shelter and meat for the body , energy and inspiration for the spirit . And so Tonweya turned , looking toward the path ahead , setting his eyes on the responsibility he had accepted , vowing to keep safe these trails thatp403lead the people to and from this great uplift , their earth-mother . These trails and whatever different ones the Lakotah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail to the black hills in the company of leaders , men with influencing-power ; one wide moving line five men across , the five principal Titonwan horseback , each leader on a horse of different color . Here Zuzueca on a shining black seed-horse , and next Mnisa , riding a big red ; here Isna , principal man of the Kuya , on his white horse , and next Hinyete , the Siyo , sitting up on a sand-yellow . Olepi marveled his observation : four colors symbolizing four directions , perhaps meaning that in a different season these horses scatter , tearing the tribe assunder , the people bleeding ? And what of himself , the Mahto leader who sits a spotted horse , a creature red and white ? Suddenly Olepi remembered himself at the sungazing , the wind owning the power to blacken the sky , black sky trying to shatter him with a streak of crooked light and a frightening noise . The people had run , scattering , but Olepi had stayed , thongs tying him back and breast to four poles ; Olepi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking again at the one on the black horse , Olepi imagined a black warrior-shapewith many eyes flashing , something man yet not-man . But the next moment this shape became the familiar , Olepi gazing at the dark-skinned Zuzueca as if truly he looked upon Iktomi in disguise . For certainly he had glimpsed momentarily this Kiyuksa as something harmful to the tribe . A secondlook and he had seen a challenge in Zuzueca 's treachery , not to him but to his son , Ahbleza . Black , symbol of the power that piles up clouds , brings rain , makes grass . Black , symbol of the power that brings the wakinyan rumbling out of the clouds , hunting something to destroy . Black , symbol of power and overpowering . Zuzueca , his skin almost black ; Zuzueca riding a black horse , perhaps symbolizing his power to make or break the tribe . Zuzueca , a power but one not to trust . Ahbleza rode enjoying every moment of this move toward the black hills , the young warrior displaying a gaiety unusual to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he had used this creature in a show of tricks . Inviting the little boys who played at the edge of the traveling line of people to take aim at his horse , Ahbleza bet these youngsters that not one of their blunt shafts will so much as graze Tatezi . A group of big boys , noticing , had come up to test their skill also , but Ahbleza had kept his horse a dancing target outside their reach . After a while he stopped this game for different stunts , many girls watching him now . He ran his horse slowly while he made seven leaps to the groundp404and up again all in rapid succession . But the unusual thing , he jumped on facing backwards as easily as facing front . Different youths had similar acts but he had two tricks that none yet had tried . And when a certain young woman begins to notice , he will demonstrate ; he will perform something reallyspectacular . Waiting for this one , he hooked his heels under Tatezi 's belly-band , then running the horse very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child who ran across his path . But always he let down the child most carefully , watching the little one totter off before he quirted the horse into the next daring run . Some children , seeing the fun in this game , purposelystood in his way , but for all the abrupt stops and dodging , not once had he lost control of self or horse , never coming close to any sort of upset . From a place among the women , Winkte viewed Ahbleza 's performance as something resembling a dance and so this one composed a song to remember Ahbleza 's graceful maneuvers horseback . And the people , hearing , cheered the composer and the rider . Never before had Ahbleza strutted before women and now he grew amazinglybold . He whipped up and down the line , his hand grabbing up hair ornaments , feathers , old moccasins  --  anything a moving people drop along the way . And then , his arms full , he bent and picked up a quilled strip with his teeth . The next moment , he threw open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moccasins , and pieces of hide fluttering down , a colorful fall of discards . For now he saw the one he will have witness his most impressive trick . The young woman 's mother rode ahead , a child in the baby-carrier she had hung on the front of her tall wood-seat . The daughter led a horse loaded with bundles , and an old woman , walking alongside the young one , guided a horse who dragged tipi covers . Ahbleza had made certain that he had everything assembled for his act and so the approaching women saw four horses lined up in front of the young warrior . One long , long cord went around the jaws of these creatures , Ahbleza commanding all when he commanded one . And so , giving a tug on the cord , he moved off this group together ; jumping onto the near horse , he soon urged the four into a fast run . Now he jumped from the back of the one to the next in line until he reached the outside horse . Here he leapt to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs , the four creatures staying abreast . Making his return , he leapt over the back of one , then stood facing the next one 's tail . Many persons stopped to watch as Ahbleza now slowed , then turned these horses . Starting his ride back down the line of people , he rolled in the manner of a hoop , arms and legs taut as he flung himself sideways over and up , over and up . Certain ones who observed threw a hand across their mouth , men and women whom not only will Ahbleza amaze with his brilliant exhibition butp405who will marvel that this shy and modest young man demonstrates his skill boldly , openly . Again jumping from one to another , Ahbleza released each horse separatelyuntil he reached the fourth . Now swerving in close to the young woman for whom he had put on the show , he lifted her up to a place in front of him , his arms tight across her breast . His thighs directed the horse , the two riding toward a secluded point back of some boulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One more moment the young warrior held on to the struggling woman ; then her teeth bit into his wrist . Letting go one hand , he pulled on the braids hanging down her back . His grasp on her hair tilted her face and so he saw her eyes , something big and full of fear . Suddenly he remembered the woman in the enemy lodge from whom he had taken moccasins . " I will not hurt you . " He sat amazed at his own words ; he had spoken as if to a captive whom he decides not to kill instead of to the only woman around whom he ever had put his arms , ever wanted to hold . Puzzled , even embarrassed , he looked on her face ; slowly his fingers let go her hair . He saw that her head bowed , that she sat unmoving . He spoke most quietly . " Perhaps . . . perhaps you know that I . . . I watch you . " He waited for a sign saying that she understood him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on her braids , but gently . " I like you , " he said softly ; " I like you very much . " She jerked up her head now and , facing away from him , she murmured certain phrases , something which will stun the young man , hurl his heart to the ground . He got down from the horse but the young woman stayed on ; he will lead her back to mother , grandmother , who wait along the trail . Ahbleza felt an overwhelming desire now to ride back among the herders at the rear of the camps , but the instant he left the woman with her relatives , the warriors had crowded around , their eyes laughing , their voices teasing . But they came admiring . Ahbleza demonstrates a new way for approaching a young woman , snatching her up on a horse and dashing off , ignoring the old women who shout threats at him . Certainly , Ahbleza 's way , something more exciting than a meeting along the water-trail or sitting in a tree half the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain someone to sneak out the lodge . But above the laughs and the cheers , the old women had rasped out at Ahbleza , their tongues wagging alarm for all girls , all young women . Mothers , they screeched , will hunt strings for tying their daughters thighs after this approach wherein a leader 's son takes a woman beyond their supervisingeyes . What girl dares feel safe , they raged , now that a certain young warrior puts such notions into the heads of other young men ? Scarcely aware of banter and harangue , the son of Olepi reflected thep406young woman 's sad-soft message : her brothers and uncles agree that Mnisa will make a good husband and so she will respect their wishes . She will go into the old man 's lodge as his third wife when snow comes . Am I the only one in the tribe , Ahbleza asked himself , who knows not of this woman 's pledge to her relatives and to Mnisa ? And will my foolishness make trouble between Mnisa 's band and the Mahto or between my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-and-seven winters and leader of his camps , regard a youth ten-and-seven as someone too insignificant to notice and so ignore the whole thing ? Shamefaced , Ahbleza went about collecting the four horses he had used , ones he had helped his uncle Huste gentle , horses he had borrowed for his act . He will lead the four to a place at the back of the line and he will hide in their dust for a while . But before he had moved these horses to the rear , someone came riding up , speaking boldly and flashing him an admiring look . " The son of Olepi teaches the warriors something . " Ahbleza instantly looked away . Why will Hinzi , properly indifferent to his presence in the lodge , choose to violate custom now ? Custom will not permit him rudeness toward his father 's young wife  --  this woman but three winters more than he  --  but neither will custom demand that he make answer . And so he stood pretending that the wind carried off her words before ever he heard . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discomfort . For reasons of her own . When she had gone , Ahbleza went to the back as he had intended , offering the horse-herders his help . But again someone came riding to see him , someonepainted yellow and wearing a skin neckpiece . This person carried the two-lash whip of the Tokala clubmen , this man a member of the Tokala lodge and one of ten akicita in control of the traveling villages . Ahbleza looked up unsmiling at the horseback , someone who calls himself Pella since the day he permitted the Tokala to pull out hair from the sides of his head . Pella , son of Ogle , brother to Tonweya , someone toward whom Ahbleza sensed a growing disdain , someone who had changed his name from Gnuska to Pella but who had kept the same disgruntled nature . Pella spoke now , his tone mocking : " My friend , I hear that I miss somethingextraordinary . But while you put on a show I , a Tokala , attend to my work " The red paint covering Pesla 's mouth will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " he jeered , " includes keeping the children in line but your fancy games with these little ones makes difficult my task . " He swung his whip casually " For the good of the moving camps you shall refrain from using Titonwanchildren  --  and Titonwan women  --  for demonstrating your skill . " Ahbleza held on to himself ; the ridiculing words shall pass in silence . And now he watched Pella ride off , the man 's fingers tight around the longnotchedhandle of his whip , a whip-bearer who aches for something  --  orp407someone  --  against whom he dares raise the Tokala whip . And until Pella fulfills this compulsion , let everyone stay out of this clubman 's path . The Tokala , riding away from his unsatisfying encounter with Ahbleza , pondered the rules of his lodge . Certainly his interest in belonging to an akicita-lodge bears on something more than watching over children and dogs in a traveling camp ; any grandmother will handle these things . Nor will the settling of loudmouth quarrels excite him ; any peaceman who carries a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip-bearer  --  a vacancy occurring shortly before the bands moved toward the hills  --  they had asked if he understood the power of the whip . But when he had answered saying that a whipcarriershall lash the legs of any member who refuses to dance or the back of any Titonwan who resists an akicita 's command , the pipe-keeper had regarded him sternly , then reviewed the purpose of the Tokala-lodge . " Each Tokala , " the pipe-man had said , " shall consider himself a peacekeeperat all Titonwan gatherings  --  hunts , moves , ceremonies . But watching over camp will not answer why the Tokala form a brother-lodge . " The clubmanhad paused but his eyes had remained on the new member , on Pella . " Hear me . The Tokala pledge their help to the old and to cripples . They hold up the honor of a tribe which boasts that none starve and that all own robes . They remember woman 's high place and so they treat kindly their wives , also women captives . " The speaker , turning from Pella , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to a lodge-brother , never takes away anything from a lodge-brother , neither horses nor women . But the rules say that if a brother-Tokala lacks a wife , those members with more than two women shall offer one to the lonely man . In this manner members provide for wives who seek diversion , but nothing happens without consent all around . " When the pipe-keeper had finished , a different one had spoken ; the drumcarrierhad made clear the meaning of the whip . " The two who carry whips , " he said , " act as an example . They keep all lodge rules , all camp rules . The whip-men sit as head akicita in the Tokala lodge . But he who keeps good conduct among the members shall conduct himself in proper manner , in and out this lodge . Let the whip-bearer regard the whip as a symbol of self-discipline . " They had presented the whip to Pella after these speeches , and he had pounded the earth vowing bravery and truth whatever occurs . Now , again riding up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make something occur and so put into effect his vow . Before trees pile their leaves on the ground and crackle underfoot , he will sneak out alone and make a quiet approach into an enemy camp . He will carry the Tokala whip but he will act in the manner of a lance-bearer . And something more : he will test the truth of the pipe-keeper 's speech , allp408that talk about Tokala members with more than two wives and the man who has none . The man , amazed , stared at Pegla ; then he spoke : " You have many chances among the young women in camp , fine women who as yet never speak with a man . They want a strong young warrior like yourself . So why take a woman already wife , four winters my wife ? " " I dare not take her from you , my brother Tokala , as you know . I am here asking that you give me the woman . " The unusual request had confused the husband . True , the Tokala rules to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing , but never , to his knowing , will anyone use this privilege . Perhaps a man will offer a wife , but what manner of man will come asking for this favor ? He tried to recall something which disputed the whip-bearer 's demand . And demand , ' the word for this insult . " You soon will own one more horse . . . two more horses , if you desire . " Pegla spoke brazenly . The man 's quick gesture scorned the offer . What manner of person trades a wife for a horse or even considers such things ? Perhaps the blood-families of two young people who show their desire to raise a lodge exchange horses in honor of the mating-pair , but never will a man secure a wife through a present of horses to her people . " The woman has a say in this arrangement . " The husband 's voice tightened . " None forces a woman against her desires . When this thing happens , everyone suffers . " " Everyone suffers when a husband holds on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off into the darkness , away from the cunning that made him feel trapped . " I see , " Pegla said now , " that my Tokala brother will not oblige me in this favor . And so I wonder whether he keeps all different pledges he makes when he becomes Tokala . They say he has more horses and more wives than any other member . They say he owns more horses than the leaders of his tribe . And that he holds on to three women . " The husband answered sharply : " Tell me of a rule that says one man shall not possess more than another man . " " Apparently my akicita-brother remembers not that a Tokala pledges help to the weak and any have-not in camp . What about the blind or someone suffering an injury or the woman who lacks a meat-provider for her small children ? When a man becomes Tokala he pledges that his possessions shall flow out in the direction of true need . " But perhaps you never discover these lodges in need and so you will appreciatemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man answered nothing , and so after a little wait Pegla spoke again . " Hoye , my friend , I agree . I and you talk enough . They permit nothing angry between lodge-brothers and certainly a Tokala never threatens his brother . "  |p409The  young warrior placed his hand briefly on the man 's shoulder but feelinga stiffness , he smiled and moved toward his horse . Attempting indifference , the husband made a final reply . " I will speak to the woman . If she accepts , look for her to bring you moccasins . " He turned abruptly and went back into his lodge . And Pe  --  la rode off certain that within the next two , three days he shall own a wife . Wipatawin listened carefully to her husband 's words . He had tried to keep anger out his voice but she understood that even the two day 's wait after his talk with Pegla had not cooled his temper . But certainly he had spoken to the point : Pe  --  la wants her . Go to him if she wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living here four winters and a sister to the original wife . She stood tall , a proud-walking person and owning a most pleasing voice for song . And so the Tokala-lodge had invited her to become one of their four women singers . Wipatawin had not borne the husbanda child and so she took pleasure in honoring him in this manner , as wife of a Tokala member to whom the lodge taught their songs . But during this summer 's encampment the husband had taken a third wife , this new one unrelated to the other two women . And now Wipatawin , the middle wife , sat uncertain of her position . But she kept on with her singing , a source of much pleasure , and she had not made any complaints . She had come to know Pegla during those song-teaching occasions in the Tokala-lodge , the young warrior coming not to sing but to listen . Once , twice she had observed his glances but she had not looked for something . He had appeared to enjoy her singing and she , learning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's endurance . They say that one who offers himself for this painful experience usually goes out of the lodge before they finish pulling hair from one side . But not Pesla . But why Pegla will want her , a woman already wife and three winters more in age than this warrior , she will not understand . Certainly none call her unattractive but neither will they regard her as really good-looking . Perhaps Pegla likes a tall woman . . . or a good singer . . . or perhaps she owns a power for attracting men she not yet recognizes . But she will remember also that her husband takes a third wife this summer and that he bluntly tells her , go to Pegla if she desires . And so , crawling into her sleeping robes , Wipatawin lay pondering whether to stay or go , whether to live as middle-wife in the lodge of a kind-face man or to sit alongside Pesla , the one wife in the lodge of a cruel-face man . Perhapsa change will bring her a child and so fulfill this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . . . for a while . Or so says any woman who makes such a change . Napewagte , keeping to her place in the line of travel , rode at the front of her tiyoSpaye , a woman properly attentive not only to these five relatedp410lodges but to all twenty-and-nine lodges that make up the Mahto band . Meaning the two hundred persons  --  four Mahto villages  --  who keep an orderlyline each day , raise a neat camp each night . Children , horses , even the camp-dogs traveled in a manner that made Napewaste proud . Ina had said that never will she remember her sister in a more contented mood than duringthis walk to the black hills . Now the people crossed a stream and Napewaste looked back at her daughter Kehala , who , leading a horse piled tall with bundles , entered the water guardedly . " Shallow water , " she called to the girl , her own heavily loaded horse midstreamand the water barely to the creature 's shanks . A second backward glance satisfied Napewaste that Unci also made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swam the rivers , waded the streams . And so she came now , moccasins in hand , keeping close to Ina , whose horse dragged poles . Only the one , Napewaste told herself as she reached the opposite edge of the stream , refuses to stay with her own family . Hinziwin had preferred to keep company with a group of girls who rode imprudently near the warriors , their giggles aimed at attracting the young men . Hinzi 's favorite companion , a bold-eyes flirt , sat ready to return any young man 's glance , to encourage any youth who looked her way twice . " Your friend displays little modesty , " Napewaste had said , but the admonishingphrase had slid off the young wife like rib-bones skimming on ice . " I regard this friend as a sister , " Hinzi had answered , tossing her head and jingling the long string of shells which decorated her hair . " Perhaps my sisterfriendwill live in this lodge one day . " She had touched the shining beads looped around her neck . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Laughing , she had run off . For a while Napewaste had thought about the shining beads and those fine skins which made up Hinziwin 's gowns . She recalled the young wife 's enthusiasmover these hides while Olepi had sat within hearing , but she rememberedalso those many complaints about aching fingers while Hinzi worked on these skins . Eventually Napewaste had taken over this work , her expert hands softening , whitening the hides , then fastening the pieces together , forming the gown . But when she had offered to quill the wings  --  something she truly enjoys  --  Hinzi had grabbed the gown ; her sister-friend , she had said , will decorate the shoulders . Napewaste 's designs appear nice enough , glances and gestures had told , but Hinzi 's girl-friend colors the quills brightly and she dreams the most exciting patterns . When next Napewaste had seen this gown , she had bowed her head . Kehala at age eleven proved a more competent quiller than the one who decoratedHinzi 's gown . Apparently this girl-friend will know nothing about splicingwhen one uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in many places ; the gown will need most careful handling . But the young wife had neglected this gown , showing her usual indifferencep411toward cleaning off stains , never using suds or powders that keep garments fresh and neat , never out looking for cannakpa , those **30;6515;TOOLONG , that help remove grease spots . And so Napewagte , unwilling that Hinzi 's disregard for appearance embarrass the family , mended and cared for all of Hinzi 's robes and gowns and moccasins but the young woman never had shown any sign of gratefulness . Even so , Napewagte found herself wishing now as often before that Hinziwinhad come into her lodge as daughter , as someone to whom she dared give her affection , dared protect . But protect from whom , the woman will not know . " Why stand here ? You belong in the lodge with the other women . " Olepi , coming from a smoke with the leaders , had discovered Hinziwin waiting for him along the dusky path ; he neither looked nor sounded pleased . " Perhaps my husband will enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenders . " Hinziwin 's voice matched the appeal in her eyes . They rode out a little distance from the overnight camp , stopping near a wooded place . Here , the young woman jumped from her horse with the ease of a boy . Sitting , she smoothed the ground at her side . " If my husband will sit also , I shall tell him something . " The man dismounted but he remained standing , waiting . " I speak about the son of the Mahto leader . " Olepi stood as before , his silence disturbing ; and so the woman spoke quickly . She told of Ahbleza 's tricks horseback , hinting that the young warriorput on this act for her approval . When Olepi kept silent , she glanced at his face . And now something made her wish she never had begun the story . She hurried on , wanting to reach the point at which Ahbleza rode off with a girl whom everyone in camp knew had pledged herself to Mniga . " I know nothing about this woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olepi 's feet and reached out to touch his moccasin . The man moved his foot away . " What more gossip will you bring ? " He spoke mildly but he had not looked mild . Suddenly the woman let go her growing irritation . The affectionate tone dropped out of her speech and her eyes flashed contempt . " I bring you my own gossip . I will have you know that I am neither water-carrier nor errand girl for those women in your lodge . I am your wife and I will not have a bunch of old women telling me whom I dare choose for friends and in what manner I shall decorate my gowns and clean my robes and brush my hair and all those other things . I will take care of myself and whatever belongs to me , but I will not work in any tipi Napewagte manages , an old prude who never wants me to have any fun . But I happen to know that she will sneak and trick to get something . "  |p412A  spark flashed in the leader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits the hunter 's wife when your son wants a wingbone whistle . As usual , she manages things and so Ogle persuades you . . . " Olepi interrupted , his voice mild as before . " You talk too much . " Getting on his horse , he signed that the woman mount and follow him . Never had Hinziwin felt remorse or apprehended difficulty beyond her powers for handling ; certainly her attractive face and appealing manner favorablyimpressed even those persons who knew to look out for her cunning . But not before now will she have a chance to discover the true extent of her power . And so , riding along back of this resolute man , she imagined in what manner he will treat her impudence . Will he consider cutting off her pretty hair and gashing her arms with a knife ? Or perhaps he leads her toward a lonely place where he will cut off the tip of her nose , even cut out her tongue . They say a man will deface a disrespectfulwife , especially a woman he adores . Hinziwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently Olepi had considered none of these punishments . He simplyled her back to camp , then told her to put up her own lodge  --  and fast . And before dawn she shall get the thing down and prepare to move out in company with members of the family  --  and she shall walk with the family . And so , alone in her little tipi this night , a vexed Hinziwin regretted that she had not said more to Olepi against the sister-wives or about his son Ahbleza . Whatever he will attempt with stick or knife and whatever she will try in an effort to protect herself she will find preferable to this thwarting of her scheme , this omission of a challenge that tests her persuasive powers . She began to cry but soon used up her tears ; instead of acting like a child , why not sit calm and ponder woman-ways for distressing a man , perhaps something which involves his son , something to make the people talk behind palms and fans . Then certainly Olepi will remember about cutting off the tip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife at the camp 's edge , had returned to the nearby knoll where a little while back he had sat talking and laughing with relatives and friends . He came here now neither for talk nor laughter ; he wanted quiet and loneliness and a pipe for comfort . The man , riding far front of the space on which his son had performed with the horses , had missed Ahbleza 's exhibition . And perhaps Napewaste had walked far back in the line ; certainly she had said nothing about this demonstration of skill . Perhaps she chose not to mention this act , her reticencerelating in some way to Hinziwin and the young wife 's pretense that Ahbleza put on his performance especially for her . Or perhaps the incident concerning the girl whom Ahbleza had grabbed up embarrassed Napewaste and discouraged any talk about this show . Certainly Napewaste never acted in any sneaky , tricky way , the woman never holding back something . . . . Olepi gazed at his pipestem in a moment of self reproach ; he had permittedp413himself to dwell on Hinziwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows Hinziwin 's ways . Or will he really know this woman ? Will any man ever reallyknow any woman ? Perhaps woman , the only true mystery that man ever shall encounter . Tonweya laughed . From here  --  his new lookout point  --  he had seen his people appear on top a rise , the bands catching up with the leaders , the travelersresembling a great stretch of trees along a ridge , as if all the standingpeopleon earth suddenly grew in this one place . But his second look showed him that these standing-people tumbled downhill  --  people , horses , dogs amass , everyone slipping , rolling , sprawling down together , the dust of their slide similar to a great yellow smoke signal that tells of their approach . He had imagined those proud-walkers at the front encouraging the people to make a game of this descent , the whole starting down together , each one trying to stay on his feet and reach bottom without a scratch . And he had imagined the laughter as they started , certain ones clowning , different ones holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses neighing . The young scout leaned back against the sky , his own laughter joining theirs , the distant laughter as real as if he heard . Wasu cooked small meat over a handful of embers , his only warm food since the people began traveling west toward a winter campsite . And according to his notched stick this will mean he had lived six days on wasna , scoutfood . He turned the meat slowly and shifted his position to catch the smell , half the pleasure of eating in the teasing smoke . Slapping his belly , he sat back and looked at the sky . The air seemed different , something more than the haziness common to the changing season ; the midmorning sky appeared drowsy in an unfamiliar way . Wasu stood and , moving away from his fire , sniffed the four directions for burning grass . Suddenly he kicked aside the roasting meat ; using his robe , he smothered the fire in the manner that makes a thick signaling smoke . Some distance away Po , lifting himself out of his nest , breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . Using spit , he moistened the inside of his nostrils . He sniffed the south in short , quick sniffs . Next thing , he began twirling a fire , something with which to signal the people . The look-alike scouts prowled the dry , crackling brush north of Wasu 's watch . One of these two , lifting his chin , used his face for a pointer . He called his brother 's attention to a pale red reflection in the sky The twins climbed a rise for a look toward the south . Pasu lay , eyes closed , quiet as a sleeping rattler on a butte . But now his hand moved slowly onto his belly ; he scratched , brushing off a little bug thatp414tickled his skin . And now he stretched himself , kicking and rolling like a young horse . He sat up and , reaching for a piece of wasna , chewed slowly on this scoutmeat . But suddenly he stopped chewing ; he stared at a far-distant redness , something that curled across the sun-dried earth . Looking under his palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he saw only the narrow red stripe that meandered over the yellow plain , among the dark , dark red patches of pte-grass , around the patches of bald ground . The people saw Pasu 's signal , his puffs of smoke telling that an impetuous wind moves a grass fire swiftly , a fire that intercepts their path . And now the leaders , seeing smoke-clouds arise from different high points , counciled these messages , contemplating ways to step around the fire . But the experienced advised an instant face about ; start firing a strip of the ground over which the people already pass . Let everyone work , the clubmen supervising . Let children help the women pull up grass , pile up roots . The stretch of plain these people burn will stop the approaching flame and the black earth soon will cool . But once the bands move again , they shall remember that smoldering chips hold fire a long while , as much danger in burned feet as in burned thighs . The people started their work at once , the fire now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-tenders stayed with the snorting herd , but different youths sneaked out to use their arrows on the little creatures who fled before the flame , the singed and lame an easy target for a boy . But the clubmen , watchful in every direction , came up quickly , restraining these game-makers , sending these youngsters back to work on the fire-line . And so the young discovered that when a people walk dangerously , the one gives way to the safety of the whole . Pezi , keeping close to Tonweya as from the start , interpreted Pasu 's robewaving : " I shall hunt streams and grassy ground , anything the fire skips . The bands will need these places for the horses . I go , you stay . Wait for the people ; ride awhile with those scouts at the rear . " Tonweya 's heart soared ; he will see his brother-friend and his family . Perhapshe will get a night 's sleep in his mother 's lodge and a taste of her cooking . The wind that sent this grass fire blew good onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for him ; wind , a friendly force , a message-carrier . Ogle settled against a pile of robes and sucked on his pipe ; Cankuna and her daughters , having stacked the meat bowls , took places on the opposite side of this traveling tipi , their eyes smiling gladness at Tonweya 's return . And the youth , gazing at his crossed legs , sat waiting for the speeches that will welcome him into the lodge as a visiting son , a son who sleeps in lookoutswhile the bands travel . The sight of his family  --  everyone here but Pegla  --  along with three bowls of the most wonderful soup his mother ever had made , proved remarkablyp415comforting , and yet the young scout 's keen ears sensed a strain , the welcomingtalk slow to come . Ogle had drawn twice on the pipe and now he offered Tonweya a smoke , his act a surprise to this son if not to each one sitting around him . " This lodge , " Ogle said quietly , " shelters but one blood-son . " He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother takes a wife . " His father 's tone , not the news , disturbed Tonweya ; the man had spoken as if he announced one of the four tragic losses instead of this glad news . Or will Ogle hint at something contrary ? Until this moment Tonweya had understoodhis brother 's absence as meaning that Pesla eats in the akicita-lodge , but now he wondered which woman Pe  --  la had taken for wife ; he waited to hear his new relative named . " A Tokala member offers your brother one of his wives , " Ogle said . " She sings for the Tokala . . . the tall one of the four . " The hunter 's inflection dismissed more talk of Pesla ; the man wanted to hear Tonweya speak now , parents and sisters eagerly awaiting words about that which impresses this son as he commences work , as he becomes ears and eyes and nose for the tribe . But on his sleeping robe in his mother 's lodge this same night , Tonweya had pondered his brother 's choice . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a one-alone woman , someone who never belongs to a different man ? He , Tonweya , will want a one-alone woman if ever he mates . But will a scout really have need of wife ? Not often will he eat , sleep in camp ; why a woman ? Before he slept , he remembered again the food his mother had prepared for him , comparing that which she cooked to wasna , scout-meat . Why not a woman , he decided , and fell asleep smiling . WASU HAD cut five more notches in his stick ; for eleven , twelve days they had traveled toward the sheltering hill . But not as many people walked in this line now . The Kiyuksa had dropped out far back , and the Kuya  --  these people scattering into three different snow camps  --  had left the line two , three days before . The MniSa village , looking for a thickly timbered stream , strung along far to the rear . The travelers had experienced two big hunts as a tribe , and the plain hadp416yielded generously of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the round yellow moon and the rain-birds all agreed that the people separate ; what one camping ground ever will support all Titonwan during moons when nothing grows , when the herd hides and many creatures sleep , when everythinggoes under the snow ? The leaders had guided their people along a safe path , neither attacks nor fear of attacks . Three Titonwan had died , two old men and one old woman , persons who had found travel difficult , who gladly let go , who chose to roll off the drags . But now the people walked within three , four days of their winter campground , grizzly butte not far off , many attractive sites between here and the lonely rise . And so the Siyo discovered relatives already encamped along kills-himself creek , and the Okandada , seeing that the Siyo will stop near these people , walked only a half-day beyond . But the Mahto went on to the foot of the great butte , perhaps memories of previous camps at this site pulling the band into the sheltering shadow of the steep , steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain Mahto remembered that whoever climbed to this level saw the starting-place of the horizons . And the women viewing these ledges remembered that the moons above this cliff signify menin-the-lodges , the contented season . Children who glanced up recalled those stones they had carried to the branches of a fragrant tree growing on the hillside , stones that related in some mysterious way to the invisibles . Or so their parents had told . Ahbleza , lifting his eyes to the butte , remembered himself as a spirit , somethingdrawing on the energy here , strengthening the will , freshening the power . Gazing at the top , he felt himself lifted above the butte , standing now as on a cloud , acknowledging the wonder not of hills and horizons but of his own indestructible spirit . Tonweya , smiling up at the tree-topped summit , recalled his people as he had seen these travelers back on the ridge , like a great forest . But he saw also the earth out of which this wondrous butte grew , and seeing , he knew himself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people approaching the butte saw the scout , saw Tonweya , a lithe form poised between grass and billowing cloud , a lone mediator between earth and sky . On different occasions Wanagi , approaching the butte , had seen this hill as perhaps most Mahto saw  --  an abrupt intrusion on the calm of the plain . Now , suddenly , he glimpsed not butte but the power that constructs a butte , a thrust of fire from under the earth that disturbs the original stone-nation , displacesthe boulders , relocates the pebbles , separates stone-families . The next instant his memory sent him back ten-and-seven winters to the night of Peta 's dying , to the fire song he had beaten out on his breast ; from above , he had sung , someone tells of fire under the earth.  |p417And  then he remembered that during these seasons , these seventeen , eighteenwinters , he had lived drawing upon gkan , the spiritual vitality . And that , without knowing exactly when , he had recognized himself as stable ; he had become a man of habitual spiritual awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that on top of this hill he shall receive the sacred-stone songs . Wait , his familiar-voice had told him , wait until you see that place whereon you choose to meet your soul . Here on this butte , he answered now , I choose to meet my self . The earth owns two good days , one visible and one invisible ; the earth owns two good days , one the body senses and one the spirit visualizes . The earth owns two good days , one the reasoning identifies and integrates and one the spirit desires and absorbs . And on the day man recognizes his power to overlap these two , he owns the earth ; the grandfathers had said so . The butte welcomed the wapiya ; each thing Wanagi touched or sniffed , heard or saw on this hill agreed with him . He had reached the flat top before midday . The earth had lent him one of her two good days and the sun had thrown him strings of light on which to climb , hand over hand , ledge to ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had awakened at his approach and , rolling out around his feet , had called him grandfather . ' He had answered , saying grandchildren . ' A gentle wind had led him among the squatting trees until a certain one had whispered his name , calling him Wanagi , spirit-man . Smiling he had stopped here and , brushing aside tree-droppings , had widened a space of bare earth . And then he had performed a little dance on the cleared ground , his pipestem swinging in his hand . He had brought the stem but not the bowl ; he had brought the important piece of the pipe . And now he sat gazing out onto the plain where dark patches and white curving lines awaited his definition . But he recognized only the yellow silence . Everything blends , he told himself ; I sit between two seasons , old summer and young winter ; I sit on a day that joins each side , a day that feels warm , smells cold . I am here at midday between day and night suns ; I sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man neither young nor ancient . He reached out his hand , propping the pipestem against a boulder . He will not need the song that brings about favorable conditions ; he had heard agreement and seen silence and felt his spirit stir . He had progressed from mere perception of spirit growth to a definite realization of his spirit-body . I am here to recognize my proportions . I am here to experience my spiritualbirth . I am here to see my self born . He flung aside the piece of pronghorn hide that covered his shoulders ; he lay hack on the hard ground . Ta to iciya wo ; I return to the source.  |p418At  once the shelter tree patterned his face and breast with shadow paint and the wind came back to stand guard . Haun-n-n . He exhaled slowly , letting go his body . I shall come back regenerated , he told the earth . Haun-n-n . Exhaling yet more slowly , he let go his thoughts . Casual sensations replaced his usual alertness , his reason granting quiet and space for impressions coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle the brush , to prevent his complete abandonment . He shall maintain a subdued awareness of his surroundings when he transfers the controlto his spirit , when he goes somewhere different . And now he assembled his ultimate self in a rush of exaltation that united his strength with the overstrength , that located him in the realm of unencumberedvitality and desire . Wani . . . su . . . ogna . . . wanisugnaLiving . . . seed . . . shell . . . sourceWoman taking-on-life woman between two realms , woman growing-a-life . . . water-life . . . water-baby . . . at the source . Sound more felt than heard , a swinging sound as of tall , leafy trees swaying , sound that disappeared slowly as Wanagi sensed a presence , perhaps more than one presence , hovering over him . Something , someone , moved around , trying to attract his attention ; movement more felt than seen , shadowybut friendly movement . He felt a little uncomfortable at having nothing on him but himself . He tried to sit up but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gently , an encouraging touch that gave energy to his newborn spirit-body . He sat up , his head wobbly . Like a baby . He , a baby now ? He , born anew ? But he had desired to see his birth . " You will see your soul but not yet . " Dimly he heard his thought answered . Suddenly aware of his rapid growth on this level , his spirit-body already advanced from infant to youth , Wanagi stood erect . But his nakedness startledhim and his feebleness chilled him . Puzzled , he waited for someone to instructhim in what manner he shall draw upon the energy that surrounded him , Someone ? He looked around , but his sight , out of focus in this realm , permittedhim to see only that which concerned his own growth . And seeing the grandfathers ' will not contribute to his progress . And so he understood to listen for any voice that will guide him . One spoke now , the tones clear , the words certain : " Instead of steps , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self forward . " Wanagi moved , a current of thought propelling him along , the motion surprising , pleasing . But he used up his energy quickly . Repeating the same thought  --  his desire to advance  --  he moved again . But not far ; he had difficulty breathing.  | " You breathe differently here . Try a wide , full breath in place of your familiarlittle short ones . " Wanagi tried the big , aching breath . He discovered that moving about on his own volition , breathing in this different manner , induced a feeling of hunting for something he very much wanted . Suddenly he knew : he hunted nourishment . " The nourishment you take here , " a voice told him , " you retain . The proportionsyou collect act creatively on each other even as meat and berries act on your flesh-body . " When Wanagi asked about seeing , ' the answering voice felt like a smile . " You already know sight as an inferior sense . When you want to see somethingdistant , you move along . Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone through brightness of spirit . " The voice went on : " You now understand something of the conditions of your spirit-body . As you grow into these conditions , you reach comprehension . But until you feel familiar with your superior consciousness , move gently , proceed slowly . " Wanagi 's spirit-body had attained the age of his visible self . And he had absorbed the realities of a different element for conversion into earth activity . And now he heard a voice telling him to go back . " You come here for contact with the motivating source of your existence . You make this contact and so the invisibles shall funnel more life-giving perceptionto the visible realm through you . " Go back . Your shell , lying on the butte , awaits you . " Wanagi opened his eyes to sun and warmth . A little wind , whirling up a dust , danced across his breast , and his pipestem , leaning against the boulder , whistled at him . He sat up , listening more closely , now aware of a song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my four villages ; the moon , coming down , says so . You will see my four acts ; the sun , coming down , says so . " Sitting quietly as before , legs crossed , Wanagi heard the song twice . He had memorized the words and now he aspirated the tones . He stood . He walked around the boulder , fingering the depressions , rubbing his hand over the rough places where the stone , in frequent turns from frost and heat , had peeled . Bending down , he picked from the ground a spiraling , cone-shaped stone shell . Then , turning over the slab that lay next to the fossil , he saw a second shell projecting from the edge , not as big but identical in shape . He smiled , remembering those many seasons he desperately had wanted to receive the stone symbol , something to prove his contact with the invisible grandfathers and to ascertain his reliability as wakanhca , the true-seer . Hep420held those stones in his hand now , the precious shell-form that symbolizes contact with life from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever shall own . Precious shell-form ? Or will he mean the precious life-form that once lives within these shells ? Suddenly he heard a word , not one he ever had used , yet something strangely familiar : wanisugna . The next instant he remembered the invisibles telling him to go back , that his shell awaited him on the butte . His own body ? Or these stone shells ? Either one a covering for a seed , a life ; either one something to outgrow ... He hung the pronghorn hide from his shoulders and began his descent of the butte , his pipestem in one hand , the stone shells in the other . Regenerated and joyful , he moved briskly , the pebbles scattering underfoot , racing him downhill , calling him grandfather . ' And he answered , saying grandchil-dren . ' Stone , earth-elemental , on and under the ground , in water and in sky ; stone , constantly in touch with the sun ; stone , moving with a purpose , compellinga desire to identify with the will of the invisible grandfathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the life-force at each person'slevel of vision.  |p423PTE  , SLOPES black with pte . Tonweya lay on his belly , looking down on the many gullies leading into the narrow valley , grazing ground for the big herd . He sent a breath of thanks across the ridges , grateful to ptepazo , the grasshopper with the waveringlong horns who had pointed out the meat . A little while past , the young scout had held gently , between his thumb and finger , one of these black ground creatures . " I will keep you , grandfather , " he had told the grasshopper , " until you point out pte . My ears pick up a soft snuffling but I will not travel five suns with the wind in my face and sit contenton counting three hundred . I await the rumble of the summer gathering , females and fathers and young , blunt-horns and curved-horns and four-teeth . Perhaps one ridge now separates my four-legged brothers and me , but which ridge ? Use your black horns and show which hill I shall climb . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape waved long feelers over a black back . " I see that you possess eyes but where , your ears ? " Then ptepazo , gracefully sweeping forward his long horns , twisted these wavers south , pointing south even when the scout turned his captive around and around . Tonweya had dropped the creature into the grass . " Let none of the wingeds find you before snow , " he had murmured and begun to run in the directionpointed out to him , a man on his way to the mingling herds . The summer had grown old , the berries black-ripe , but this day smelled young and fresh . And everywhere something sang  --  in the gullies , the grasses , the sky . The life-force also flowed strongly through the scout 's heart , telling him that until a person lives a day like this one , until he hears his own voice in a great silent cry of joy , he dares not die . Tonweya , twenty-and-one , a scout who knows the earth as his to cherish and honor and protect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on his bellyp424until he lay in position to see without anyone seeing him . Then , lifting his head , he had glimpsed the black hillsides . When he looked again he had wanted to shout his gladness but not a sound had broken from his lips , not a stone had scraped under his toe . He lay a long while observing the herd , gathering facts for his report . But now , as cautiously as he had approached the high ledge , he withdrew and began his return journey over the dry white plain to pahamni ridge . The quick trail back demanded two day 's running , and so he had paced himself , jogging without stops to the most distant object on his horizon , then walking awhile , alternating his stride to conserve his breath . On the wide flat he covered himself with his robe , stooping and moving slowly , a discernible form , yet something that resembles pte . During the seven winters since his vision-seeking , Tonweya often had run long distances , enduring to the finish , rushing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . Not once had he needed to sneak in after dark , nothing to tell . Not Tonweya ; he stayed out until he found the herd . For three seasons now he had worn two waverers , the mark of a scout they recognize , the stems of these two feathers stripped up to the white tip , something to simulate the waverers , the long horns of ptepazo  --  or pte woyaka as some of the young scouts will say . But he had not earned this honor quickly . Not a man in the tribe , the grandfathers had said , holds more importance than the scout , whose truth determines the safety of the people , whose trust determines survival for the one , for the whole . The youth-vision perhaps confirms a desire , they had told , but a vision will not strengthen a man 's naturalpowers nor give him a fit body . Only the practice of pure truth makes a man dependable and only an exacting use of ears and eyes and nose sharpens his senses . And only urgencies truly empower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this run , Tonweya told himself ; if a Witapaha discovers my tracks , I will need gullies and boulders as much as I need feet . He had recalled an event four winters past when certain Titonwan had gone south with a party of Sahiela to trade with the Witapaha on the shell river . But after two , three trades something had provoked a quarrel between a Sicangu and a Witapaha , a Titonwan war club killing the Witapaha . Next day , the embarrassed Sahiela had watched their Titonwan friends drive away their Witapaha friends , the Witapaha women crying out for someone to stop the fight . The Witapaha , they say , always try to stop trouble before things go too far , but neither those cries nor the Sahiela gift-offerings had affected the irate warriors . And so this affair had finished off any efforts toward a peace with the Witapaha , any more attempts at trading with these people . The round moon rose , brightening the scout 's trail , but now he needed to keep a careful watch on his shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night when the moon sits round , not a cloud in the sky.  |p425But  whom will they raid ? Scarcely the encampment at pahamni ridge . And yet a scout never surmises anything . He had proved apt at discovering pte , and now he wanted to prove his competence at locating whatever the people will regard as important to their safety , their serenity . Actually he had located an enemy only once , his experienceinvolving an Oyatenumpa family , something that had occurred back three seasons . While scouting pte , he had come upon these Oyatenumpa , a family of eight who traveled using one horse for comfort , using camp-dogs to drag their scanty possessions . Observing signs neither of hunt nor raid , he had imagined that these people went out on a visit . But a scout lives with fact , not imagination , and so , creeping along back of the travelers for a half-day , he had noticeddetails : one baby , two children , and two women ; three men protected the group . They had not walked in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men had smoked a friendly pipe , and he had stood near enough to view one of the women while she played with the baby . He truly had enjoyed watching this family until he remembered whom he watched . Here , a people not Titonwan yet they traveled on Titonwan trails . And whatever the reason that had brought the group , he needed to regard these Oyatenumpa as an enemy and to report their presence to the bands . Before he had turned back toward camp he had contemplated capturing one of the girl-children , someone to give to his mother , someone to stop her grief for the small daughter long gone from the robe on her back . But he had not dared the risk of snatching a child from under seven pairs of eyes . And so he had run back with his report , then gone out again before hearing the council 's decision . He had learned afterwards that Pesla had joined the Mahto warriors who , locating these Oyatenumpa , had brought back the horse and three scalps  --  man , woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered from Pesla 's lance , the son of Ogle lending the woman 's hair to his sister Cuwe for the celebration dance but making a gift to his mother of the little girl 's scalp . Suddenly Tonweya wished that he had not recalled this incident , this Oyatenumpafamily whom they had killed ; the recollection had acted to shake up his belly in a most disturbing manner . But now a heavy smell on the night air told him that he approached a place of quiet water . And so he decided to linger alongside the stagnant pool , an unattractive rest stop but a place to drop his unpleasant memory and renew his strength for the distance he will run before dawn . The next moment he saw two tiny points of light , tiny spots that glowed up dimly from bare ground , that moved slowly toward the toe of his moccasin , Hoh ! a child of Iktomi , the many-legged little creature who hunts in the night . " Iktomi , hear me . The flying-mystery kills you . " Speaking softly , the scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the specks of light disappeared before he let the weapon fall.  |p426And  so what happens ? Never permit Iktomi to cross your path , they say ; kill Iktomi with a stone but never silently . Remember that Iktomi tricks everyone . But will this attractive crawling creature really bring on a black-dog and the scolding little old grandmother bird who , working together , will drive off the pte that he , Tonweya , locates ? Such acts in keeping , the people tell , with Iktomi 's treacherous ways . Dropping to his knees the scout hunted the wet grass but he saw nothing more of those six tiny gleaming eyes , two on top and four under . The only thing around now , those annoying lump-raisers . And so scratching his arms , slapping at his shoulders , he started out again at a jog ; he intended to reach pahamni before Iktomi put any schemes to work . And he intended to avoid any more remembrances of past seasons , past experiences . Enough that he concentrate on keeping his shadow small and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The people looked from under the edges of their tipi  --  the covers raised to permit a midday breeze  --  and saw the skinny legs of Eyanpaha as the crier passed by , the man 's strong voice a contrast to his bony shins and knees . Throughout the seasons he had remained the favorite mouth in the tribe . And now he announced the approach of a scout who came running zigzag towardcamp , a good sign as everyone knew . " He protects you . Remember this thing and make him gifts . " The crier sang out his advice . Many persons hurried out from their lodges , going toward the center , but the old men , leaning against the tipi covers during the midday heat , waited for a howl from the ridge ; not until the scout gives this signal will they get up and shuffle toward the center lodge . On hearing Eyanpaha , the four deciders had sent someone to pile up chips in front of the big tipi while they put on their shirts and paint , each one makinghimself presentable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing their leaders assemble , came forward now and many girls moved slowly toward the center , more than one girl eager for a glimpse of Tonweya , more than one woman waiting to see if he will glance her way . Suddenly everyone sat alert ; they had heard a howl in the near distance . At once five men , affixing pte-horns to their heads , started walking toward the edge of camp . Tonweya waited on the ledge after sending his signal . Let the summershirtsprepare the center for his report ; let the people gather for his arrival . But certainly he shall rush in as if ten Psa come close on his moccasins ; everyonelikes to see a scout puffing , likes to watch a scout who races in short of breath . Now the people saw the horn-wearers meet the scout and the scout begin his dash . Next thing , Tonweya stood close by , his breath coming in big gasps ,  |p427his  appearance more that of a handsome youth who had won a foot race than that of a scout ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard from his unceasing travels on foot , moved up to tight thighs and a flat , tough belly . His fine narrow shoulders seemed designed to slip easily through thick groves and brush , and his slender but strong arms hung neither too short nor too long for the many uses to which a scout put his hands . His proportions brought admiration now as always from his own , from a people who never had lacked for evenly proportioned men . But Tonweya had not noticed the flattering murmurs . His dark eyes , calm and unchanging , had sighted the chips and , spurting forward , he kicked aside the pile and dropped to one knee . A trilling arose from where the women stood , the trills perhaps as much for his good-looking face as for his discovery of meat . Not a man among the Titonwan owned such a nose . This feature , neither hooked nor curved down , lengthened moderately and in shapely form . But Tonweya , understanding his nose only as a tool for smelling , knew that a beak like the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on most faces will not impair the smelling-power . Only one personal feature will Tonweya regret : his small ears tightly set against his head . Nakpa cikcika the people say , making a comparison with the creature who swims carrying a stick . But he had observed that a man 's ears grow in old age and so he looked for a nice big flapping pair when his winters reached fifty , sixty . Ogle , eyes proud , watched his son kneel in the formal posture of a scout who awaits the pipe from his leader 's hands or from any one of the honorablemen sitting in the half-circle . " Whatever you see , you see for the good of the people ; the nations depend upon your eyes . Your word means life to these families . " Olepi spoke , holding the stem which had touched lips around the circle , but Tonweya understood that he shall enact certain things before they put the pipe to his lips . " They will not call you child but they will say that you grow up among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see anything of the prowling true-dog or the feeding pte when you go to the hills . Tell me at what place you stand and see something good . Tell me and make me glad . " Having spoken the ceremonial phrases , Olepi swung the pipestem toward the scout . Tonweya drew a mouthful of smoke and so made his pledge to speak the truth , the whole truth . He remained on his knee , none of him moving but his thumb . " I start from where I now kneel . I go to the fork in the river and follow up the branch to the place lodgepoles grow . Here I see something old , his horns with scars and breaks . I look on a grandfather who travels a lonely trail . " I cross two dry streams and come to a hill . Here I see two more old ones with the thick horns and cracks at the tips but these two stand guarding . I lay my ear to the ground . The earth rumbles.  | " From the next rise I see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the pte watch . Two fight and I see their heads touch and hear the crash of this meeting . " But this herd will not make the great rumble I hear and so I go on . " Tonweya paused ; he wondered whether the leader accepted his report . He had not heard the familiar hai ' from the crowd nor any hau , hau ' from the headmen . They never will embarrass him with questions but certainly they will humiliate him with silence . " Perhaps on the opposite side of this small herd you see good . Report . " Olepi 's tone hinted that the scout gave detail they not yet called for . And so Tonweya omitted the story of his circling these pte and he left out any mention of the grasshopper who pointed out the proper ridge . Instead he spoke his discovery briefly : " On the far side , a bellowing . I come near a big herd , more than one band and certain pta yet choosing mates . " Now the young man heard glad sounds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great herd from on top the next ridge , " he said . " I see nothing but pte on the hillsides . " His thumb twice made the sweeping arc of a greatgreatcircle , his arm lifted high as his reach . " Hau , hecitu yelo . " Olepi had accepted the scout 's report . At once the leaders called out , shouting hoye , ' the people taking up this noisy cheer when they learned that two thousand grazed in the herd . Tonweya had reported big herds on different occasions but never before had he gone out alone and discovered this many pte . And now Olepi asked that the scout tell all things he had experienced on this occasion alone in the hills . Young pride warming his blood , the youth began his description . He spoke of the many lateral gullies entering the narrow valley . He told of the dry stream and the curly grass scorched dark yellow . The bands graze not lookingup , he said , and certain pte not yet fatten ; sucking-young keep their mothers thin . And certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many little black-hairs in the herd , their fluffy hides indicatingmore than one winter . His far-flung gaze had revealed spiked-horns and curved-horns and pte who had hunted grass under six different snows . The people shall see plenty of soft yellow fat and hard white tallow , many mature and many young in the herd . Tonweya 's listeners heard each detail with grateful ears , but more than one old hunter smiled inside his cheek at the scout 's exuberating account of this herd 's makeup . Certainly his touching the pipe pledged Tonweya to truthful speech and perhaps one with unusual eyes will distinguish pte of four winters from the six-winters females , but even the most experienced hunter will take a second look before he dares differentiate . But what really counts , this scout tells clearly where the bands graze , their vastness and actions . And so hunters , old and young , again will shout praise for all this good that Tonweya reports.  |p429When  this noise came to a finish , the crier commenced his walk around the encampment , the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paint your horses . Paint yourselves . Go out and make meat . " The people scattered , men returning to their lodges to prepare for the hunt , each one also listening for the herald who will run through camp naming the clubmen in control of this surround . Tonweya had hurried past the softly laughing girls and the smiling young women whose dark eyes and pretty gestures invited his attention ; he had not stopped until he came to the lodge Tunkasila kept for the scouts . Here , food and a sleeping robe awaited the truthbearers who sought undisturbed rest after a long run . Here , also , hung the notched stick which kept count of the sleeps he had stayed away . " I return , grandfather . " Tonweya dropped to his knee before the old one , the man in his sixty-fifth winter and sitting close by the fire on a day too warm for a robe . The old scout lifted his head and Tonweya remembered with difficulty that the glittering eyes into which he looked briefly saw next to nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick . You return bringing news of a great herd . But you speak telling the people the age of this herd . Will you count the teeth of certain pte ? Will you see the yellow stains on the shiny surface of different teeth and so you know the herd-fathers ? " Tunkasila had astounded his listener . The old man had not appeared at the center for the scout 's report and from this distance he will hear only the cheering . " You view gullies and hillsides and the grazing pte . You look and look ; you intend holding on to this picture , this whole picture . But you travel two days , and while on this run you recall different experiences , something which takes away from the picture you carry in your head . " Tunkasila had talked gesturing with his thumb ; now he closed one hand over the other . " When you return to the picture in your head , " he said , " you perhaps see blunt-horns as curve-horns . And what about the pta choosing mates ? Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pte or will you say that he mounts not more than two ? " Tunkasila 's dim eyes seemed as piercing as Wanagi 's most demanding stare . " Keep looking straight , grandson ; never let your eyes narrow down on any specific thing if you intend holding on to the whole . " The old scout , lifting his hand , again gestured with his thumb . " I once see with eyes as strong as yours . And so I know that the herd grazes as you report . I know that soon the people will sit eating fat and backfat as you describe . " Tonweya always felt good in the old man 's presence . He admired Tunkasilaas much as he respected him . Tunkasila who never hints his loneliness for the trails nor for the wife who goes from his side two winters past . Unci dies standing at her digging-stick , a swelling in her arm but nothingp430more than this sudden lumpy redness . Soon afterwards Tunkasila had asked that someone wrap her bones tightly in a red bundle , something for him to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scout-lodge , Tonweya had walked onto the campground , where he came into understanding with an enduring importance . He saw a people sharpening their hunting knives in response to that which he reported . He saw boys bringing in the runners and seers preparing the inipi . He heard women talking of new lodgeskins , singers talking of new drum-skins , and warriors talking of neck skins for new shields . He , Tonweya , describes the hillsides as black with pte , his thumb showing this herd as twice the great-great ten  --  twenty hundred  --  and meaning that they dare kill  --  kill without regret  --  more than three hundred pte during this surround . He , Tonweya , reports , and the people , acknowledging him as truthbearer , act on his words , his signs . At this moment the lives of two hundred and thirty lodges  --  twelve hundred Titonwan  --  depend upon his honor , his truth , alone . He , Tonweya , scout , ears and eyes for the tribe . Cuwe sat demurely in the family lodge awaiting her brother Tonweya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braids , decorated with hair-ties , hung long as her arms . At seventeen , she had attracted the attention of three , four young men but she had ignored Pesla 's hints that she stand under the robe with a certain warrior . Pella looked for warrior-blood in those new relatives coming to him when his sisters chose husbands but neither Cuwe nor Tacincala , now fourteen , had shown any real interest in leaving the family lodge . Tacincala sat at this moment next to Cuwe , the young one pale in contrast to her sister 's dark skin . She watched Cuwe 's manners carefully , imitating this tall , proud young woman in every way she dared . And so , Tonweya coming into the lodge now , she lowered her eyes the same as Cuwe . The scout perceived at once that they had prepared for his visit , his sisters composed and quiet and his mother 's hands idle . Nor will he see another man here . His , a hunter 's family and so father , brother , uncles , all prepare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the family tipi  --  the same as any different lodge . After a proper silence Cuwe spoke softly , her words directed at her mother 's ears . " Perhaps someone will tell my brother that I am glad he sits here . I . . . " She had more to say but Tacincala made the giggling sound . Cuwe nudged her sister and the awkward little laughs ceased . But Tonweya , picking up a ladle , had begun speaking , using the scoop as something through which to talk in the manner of one who finds himself alone with women-relatives . " I am glad that two gentle young women welcomeme in this lodge . " Again the giggling , again abruptly stopped.  |p431Tonweya  smiled . " Now that evening comes , perhaps along the water-trail a young man waits for my sister , someone who desires that she speak with him . " Cankuna heard the speech with pleasure . She had long wished that her son Tonweya , not her son Pesla , had the say as to Cuwe 's choice for husband . Tonweya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which concerned his sisters , while Pesla looked out for a personal gain . But Cuwe had heard the scout 's phrases with a tiny ache . Will this brother for whom she holds most high respect also want her making a lodge of her own now ? Will he , like Pesla , feel need for a new relative with an important name ? More giggles interrupted her thoughts . And now Tonweya turned his speech in the direction of this second sister . " My young sister soon will hear the flute , the wood singing for her ears alone . But perhaps her giggles will frighten the young man and his flute out of the tree . " The scout sounded teasing , but Cankuna understood that he gently chided his sister . And now the mother helped out everyone ; she changed the talk to something different . " Perhaps I please your brother , " she said to the young women , " when I tell that each sister cooks something to his liking . If he desires they will fill his bowl . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . But Cuwe sat on , her head respectfully bent as before . She chose to rise in a most graceful manner , not so much as a finger touching the ground when she moved from sitting position to standing . When the three , going to their cooking fire , had stepped outside the lodge , Tonweya leaned against a backrest . He stretched out his legs and yawned . The scout had stayed with Tunkasila only long enough to drink a bowl of soup ; he had decided to return to Cankuna 's lodge for his rest . Now he sat wondering which thing he desired the more : meat or sleep . He closed his eyes , but a scratching on the tipi cover aroused him instantly . He smiled ; he knew that Ahbleza had come . Go-to-the-back . Tonweya 's gesturing thumb offered the son of Olepi the place of honor at the rear of the lodge . The scout saw that Ahbleza carried the short-stem pipe ; he understood that his brother-friend came here for a different sort of talk . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informal pipe . Cankuna , not her daughters , brought the food into the lodge and in two bowls . The woman , looking at Ahbleza , permitted herself the silent greeting of eyes , her glance telling this slim , attractive young warrior that they had missed his presence here during those seven , eight days her son Tonweya stayed in the hills scouting for pte . Then , putting down the bowls , she went out of the lodge , leaving these two to whatever they will talk over , smoke over , each one a man and strong in his views . But , walking away from herp432tipi , she remembered a boy with brushes and paint and a hide to mark on , a boy who shyly had shown her pictures of horse and true-dog and pte unlike any drawings she had seen . " The white one , not among these pte . " Always the scout said this thing when he came in from the hills and the two friends met . And always this same ceremony : cutting leaves for a smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement , and finally this eating together , the first mouthful dipped from each other 's bowl . And on each occasion Tonweya silently had wished that his next scouting for pte will bring the white one of Ahbleza 's boy-seasons into the picture . So his brother-friend will know that the little white fluff-hair of fourteen , fifteen winters past yet lives , that the weathers will not daunt her , neither the cold that strikes her face nor the hail that pelts her back . The dust will not blind her and the wakinyan , the flashing sky , will not cut her down ; instead she enduresthe same as the man Ahbleza , twenty-and-four winters , endures . Looking up from his thoughts , Tonweya glanced at his companion . " My brother ! " Nothing had prepared the scout for the distraught expression . But even as he stared his amazement , Ahbleza 's face cleared ; whatever the young warrior suffered now disappeared from view . Ahbleza spoke calmly : " Will not two who share a vision also share the silentthought ? " But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , the group sitting to talk about the hunt . And so they will recall amusing stories of past hunts , the men shaking out their laughter . The brother-friends , neither one in the mood for joking , went out of the lodge at a moment when their leaving interrupted none of the gaiety . Together they walked past circles of children and parents who gathered at the evening fires , past horsebacks who sat arms folded , past the lodge of a pretty young woman where a line of five , six warriors waited , each man eager for a moment of daring  --  talk or touch  --  with this certain one . The two took their horses from the herd inside the camp . Mounting , they remembered those days when they had ridden legs touching , when , together , they had raced the wind . Now moving slowly , Ahbleza slightly front , they rode toward the edge of camp . And beyond . Approaching a hummock , they heard Wanagi 's song , the man sending his breath for the good of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , careful that they not become a disruptive influence . The sacred-man knew who rode wide of his knoll . Nor will he marvel that they pass here on an evening when he desires most strongly to counsel these two , to provide help for this pair , for the one who rides serenely into the dusk not yet aware that his people will try to break him . And for him whop433rides alongside , for Tonweya , who not yet knows that he shall put upon Ahbleza the most strain of all . Or will he , Wanagi , prove the most harsh toward this young man next to his heart ? He , wakanhca , a stone-dreamer who advises the principals of this tribe that they try the son of Olepi beyond those trials they set for Shirtman ; he , Wanagi , a true-seer , who perhaps makes this testing of Ahbleza also a testing of Wanagi . Certainly he stands here now , robe and loin-cover on the ground , a naked body with a resonant voice that commands the power for holding on to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any desire to comfort or to caution Ahbleza , from any act of interference with this man 's growth , with any man 's growth . Not far from the hill where Wanagi stood , the brother-friends had jumped off their horses onto a patch of sandy earth , a quiet place for personal talk . Ahbleza sat as always , legs crossed , and Tonweya lay back on his elbows , legs stretched front . But the scout 's easy sprawl had not hidden a concern ; he gazed earnestly into his friend 's eyes . Ahbleza permitted the scrutiny , his face lacking paint , nothing on his clean , smooth skin to hide whatever troubled him . But sensing that his show of calm proved as disturbing to his friend as his look of distress , the warrior managed an appreciating smile . " My friend , " he said , " you make yourself important to the people . " He had not intended the hint of envy in his voice . " Perhaps I will see this importance more clearly when I find the white pte ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I need the white pte , she will find me . I am not needing this one now . " The scout rejoiced at this reassurance . And then suddenly he realized that which disturbed him about Ahbleza : never before had he known the young Mahto to act uncertain . Ahbleza , the one man who walks a certain path , who goes everywhere with certainty . Until now . Ahbleza spoke on : " Your work as scout earns the praise you hear . I am proud of you , misun . " He paused . " But I also work . I also report herds and find enemy camps . And I put afoot an enemy , take his horse . Truly , I earn enough stripes for covering one arm and half the second . " I rescue the hurting and twice I fight the enemy hand to hand . For these things they grant me a red cross and a red hand on my robe . " His own words had set his eyes on fire , his tones crackling . " Certain marks I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-and-red horse-track ; I am not looking for a wounding of my horse . Nor am I yearning for the red feather of a personalinjury . " He sat silent for a moment , the burn disappearing from his eyes , the stonehardnessmelting off his face . " I am not reciting my honors to impress you , misun . Nor will anyone deny me a song or the pictures on my robe . But the puzzling thing . .. "  |p434Tonweya  saw the look of confusion and heard the embarrassment . But why this speech , the scout not yet comprehended. . . the puzzling thing sits in the manner of those persons noticing  --  or refusing to notice  --  me . Not one person praises me , not one . Not one tells me through look or gesture that they approve all I accomplish . The leaders say nothing that will encourage me along the path I choose . " I look upon different ones whose earning falls short of mine , ones whose steps trail my steps , and I hear the headmen singing their praises before all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small trilling , namely Ogle 's wife and my sister . " Tonweya , watching the clouds lose their sundown colors , remained silent . As Ahbleza spoke he had turned his gaze from the warrior 's face to the ground , then to the sky ; he will endure anything but the return of that distraughtlook to the brother-friend 's face . Seldom in camp , the scout knew nothing of the half-hearted manner in which they presented Ahbleza his honors . But hearing that which the warrior told now , he suspected jealousy . Perhaps certain ones , seeing that Ahbleza advances rapidly , grow resentful . Or perhaps certain persons in the new bands that join the Titonwan hoop dislike Ahbleza , persons big enough to influence the people . True , Tonweya sat lacking any knowledge of intrigue . The shifting of families into different bands or the shifting of bands into different tribes  --  and the reasons for these moves  --  never had interested him . He worked for whoever lived in the winter camp , in the summer circle , and his work consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . But certainly he had seen enough to know that Zuzueca , leader of the Kiyuksa , and Olepi , leader of the Mahto , held little respect for one another . Ahbleza 's voice , again bitter , broke the silence . " The leaders look through me whenever I come among these principals . And when I recite my accomplishments , I feel as if I am dancing in snowdrifts . " Ahbleza 's slender fingers pressed against his forehead . " Your father shuns you also ? " Tonweya asked gently . " My father acts similar to the others . " " And Wanagi ? " " Wanagi appears not to recognize me . " Ahbleza named different ones : Hehaka , Wambli Okiye , Cetan , Iku , Zola , Icabu , Hehlogeca , his uncles Huste and Lek  --  i . " I will talk until dawn before I name every one who refuses to recognize me . Some persons pull their robes to their eyes and so identify me with the suspicious . " Tonweya grew uneasy . " Perhaps my father will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they regard you as a son in my mother 's lodge . . . . " Tonweya stopped , the scout aware that Ahbleza had gone beyond the place where he will seek friendly council in any lodge . So why not change to some soft talk about women . . . But Ahbleza spoke again . " I decide something , misun , " he said , his tonep435once more warm , familiar ; " I shall stay outside the akicita-lodges . I admire the clubmen but I see a lone path for myself . I am not a joiner and so I will not offend anyone . I am not a person who wants control over something or someone , not on the moves and not on the hunts . I travel this far alone and I shall go on without help from any warrior-lodge . " " The wakan-dreamers keep a lodge . . . if one dreams of the branchedhornor pte or the true-dog , " Tonweya murmured . " I have my dream , " Ahbleza answered smiling . " The headman-lodge will come after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . " Certainly my father and different ones grow aware of my desire to stay outside , whatever the group . They understand . . . " Ahbleza cut off his words . Will these honorable men truly understandhim or will a silent acceptance mean that they accept his decision but disapprovingly ? Will they imagine that he puts himself above any man in these akicita-lodges , even above the leaders ? That he lacks the true-humility ? If so , some unwise phrasing , some foolish gestures bring on this untrue impression . And yet they turn their backs before ever he hints or speaks his decision . Perhaps a strange mischief hovers over him ? But now Ahbleza the one to perceive the need for a change in their talk , Uncrossing his legs and drawing up one , the warrior held his knee comfortablybetween palms and clasped fingers . " Tell me , " he said gaily , " what new secrets will the four-legs and your winged friends share with you these days ? " " Nothing new , " Tonweya answered promptly ; " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimicking the big black-bird , this voice so cleverly imitated that Ahbleza easily translated the sounds into I find food ' and fly away ' and come and chase the grows-a-horn . ' And now Tonweya , laughing at himself , told that once , while watching a grows-a-horn , he had wondered whether this great hushed-wing really turned his head all the way around . But something not so easily discovered had puzzled the scout recently : the tall-ears seem scarce , all small creatures suddenlyscarce . Once before this happens , he said , the tall-ears disappearing and the traveling-dogs letting their young die . And finally Tonweya told about iktomi with the glowing eyes , the one that escapes . " Perhaps he runs off to find the head iktomi and so they scheme mischief during the tribal hunt . " Ahbleza smiled ; he had thoughts about the hunt but not of omens . " At sunrise , misun , a whole camp moves . Your word alone sends out these hunters . " Tonweya jumped to his feet . " And I ride this night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds . I need sleep before I go . " He walked toward his grazing horse , but halfway he turned , calling to Ahbleza : " When next I see you , I talk about women . " " When next I see you , " Ahbleza called back , " you will not talk at all You will sit gorging on fresh hump. "  |p436This  same evening Olepi sat alone , pipe in hand , a man determined to rid himself of those irritations which in recent seasons had lumped into a painful sore . He had become convinced that Zuzueca , leader of the Kiyuksa , prepared to take over as headman of all Titonwan . " But the loudmouth reckons without my son , " Olepi muttered , then instantlysaw a second thought take form : Zuzueca had considered Ahblezaanddismissed him . And why not , Olepi asked himself now ; Ahbleza discourages invitations from any of the akicita-lodges , the very ones whose support he shall need if ever he intends to lead the band . And who will Ahbleza encourage as companions ? None but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter  --  but not the son of a warrior ; Tonweya , a loyal friend and a fine scout but , like Ahbleza , a man who sits indifferent to the clubmen 's lodge . In what manner , then , will Ahbleza make those connections that procure him enough voices in council ? Pipe smoke curled over Olepi 's arm as he ponderedhis son and certain powerful young women among the Lakotah . The father had seen more than one pair of eyes sparkle whenever Ahbleza walked through camp ; the son need only to choose and take . And if his choice alreadybelongs to someone ? Annoyed that he permitted these thoughts , Olepi tried to look in other directions ; instead he remembered that even Hinziwin 's smiling eyes followed Ahbleza 's graceful body and that once he had felt compelled to warn her . " Remember whom you call husband , " he had told Hinziwin . " Say nothing foolish , " she had answered boldly , " and sit at ease ; your son will find the proper woman . " Perhaps if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he never had struck a woman . But the Mahto leader had not come to this place to entertain thoughts of Hinziwin ; he had come to drain a lump of misgivings . And now he refilled his pipe ; perhaps , sitting out here alone on hard , cold stone , he shall see the pictureclearly and so understand why Mnisa wears off the grass between his own and Zuzueca 's lodge and why Mnis'a joins the Kiyuksa leader in his effort to gain control of the tribe . And whether or not Wanagi overworks this thing of testing Ahbleza for the staying-power . Slowly but certainly Zuzueca and his Kiyuksa had changed over from irregularsummer visitors to prominent members of the tribal hoop ; slowly but certainly these custom-breakers had pushed into the family circle , Zuzueca consistently referring to his camp as the original Titonwan and pointing to his brother I  --  takpe as proof : will not everyone know that Istakpe , now in his sixties , dreams in the black hills as a youth ? The Kiyuksa counted fifty lodges now but their noisy disputes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zuzueca found nothing distressing about these outbursts ; on different occasions the clubmen had heard him ap/prove a warrior 's manner of shouting at wife or dog in the same startling tone . I approve the man , Zuzueca had said , who brings trembling among his own relatives ; imagine his impact on an enemy . But when the Kiyuksa leader heard that Olepi had ridiculed this point of view , his lips had curled . " A loud tongue and fast arrows equip a man for leading war parties far more effectively , " he derided , " than a quiet voice and the soft touch of paintbrushes . Observe who inspires followers . " He had glanced toward the horns of the summer hoop , where the Okandada raised a camp of seventy-four lodges . True , the Okandada follow a most vigorous man now : Tanazin . Oowe  --  ica had died leaving a son not yet of warrior-age . And so the people had turned to the son of a different man , a man who had led a division of the Okandada until Oowegica had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man  --  Tatanka Naiin  --  had joined the Kiyuksa , but his son , Tanazin , had returned to the Okandada ten winters past when he took a wife in this band . And now , at thirty-five , Tanazin led the Okandada  --  or Oglalahca , to use the band 's new name . The change in leaders had seemed a proper occasion for renaming the band . Why not a name , they had said , to recall those winters when their grandfathers scatter dust and grow maize ? Or , as the old persons in the band say , why not a name to recall those seasons when their grandmothers scatter dust ' in a different manner and so prevent any planting ' of seeds ? Why not rename this band Oglalahca , the original Oglala ? Certainly the new leader sits above Zuzueca when they speak using that rare word first . ' Tanazin , a direct descendant of the original Tatanka Naiin , the first man ever to hold on to the pipestem that Pte-woman brings to the Dakotah . And a son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether or not the Kiyuksa claim differently . Oglalafica , seventy-and-four lodges , the most lodges in any Titonwanband ; Oglalahca , a name to wear proudly . And Tanazin , the Mahto leader told himself , provides Zuzueca with a loyaltyinside this Oglalafica band , a kinsman tie through Tanaiin 's mother , not a close tie , but something that the Kiyuksa certainly will exploit . And the Siyo ? Olepi smiled thinly ; the Mahto and Siyo bands always had maintained most pleasant relations but during recent winters problems within the Siyo family had restricted any real exchange of confidences . The people had wavered between loyalty to their leader Wacape , who appeared slowing down , and a desire to follow Hinyete , the outstanding camp leader . But then Wacape had decided for his Siyo ; accepting his debility , he had retired in favor of the competent warrior-peaceman Hinyete . Similar to a defeated herd-father , Wacape had taken a place at the edge of the council circle and from this outpost he stood watching Hinyete ; he waited to see whether the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , strong young families . He knew that Hinyete needed many things going his way if he intended to regain a strong position in the hoop . Siyo and Kiyuksa eachp438raised fifty lodges , but Zuzueca apparently looked for Mni  --  a 's camp to join with his ; certainly the Kiyuksa had dismissed Hinyete and the Siyo band as competitors for the campsite at the horns of the circle . " But let the slithering grass creature take a second look at the grizzly , " Olepi said aloud ; " let Zuzueca remember the meaning of Mahto . True , Tanainand his Oglalahca show the most warrior-power now . And I stand next . I , Olepi , lead a band that raises fifty-and-six lodges , that claims sixty warriors . But I know that not one dares predict where the power will sit even a season hence . " Ahbleza 's uncertainties had gained a new hold during the talk with Tonweya ; riding back to the village , he suddenly became as pta who rushes at whatever wounds him . He reached for the knife at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the creature tensed for combat . But before a war cry rose in his throat , Ahbleza managed to catch hold of whatever possessedhim . Slowly his fingers let loose the knife , his legs letting go their frenzied clutch on the horse . The anger moved off , the moon 's round light touching on a face impassive as stone . The horse walked among the lodges , the rider looking to the ground but seeing only his thoughts . Perhaps the people intend that he suffer anger and so win a fight against an invisible mischief . Perhaps they intend that he teach himself ways for overwhelming lust , overcoming pretense , attacking envy . Perhaps they will not scheme at testing his nature but scheme at making him test himself . And so he shall let the people see that nothing they devise proves more exacting than the demands he places on himself ; let each one grow aware that he prepares for the Shirt . " The Shirt-owner , " he whispered , " an unshakable man . I will show the people that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sleeping robe disdainful of Olepi and his son . The husband had chosen this night before the hunt as an occasion for spoilingher fun and shaming her in front of friends ; he had sent her to the tipi at the moment she seemed most likely to win a bet on the hand game . Ten outstanding players in camp and four visiting Sahiela had gathered to play **30;6547;TOOLONG and each team had won five countingsticks . Deft hiders and fast songs had aroused spectators and players , everyonenear to bursting with excitement . The Sahiela had provided the little bird-shape wood that lay in the hider 's covered palm as he crossed and recrossed his hands above , then back of his head , then down in front of his feet , each swift move anticipating someone 's pointing-stick , someone 's guess . But suddenly the piece of wood had dropped out of the hider 's hand . Instantlysomeone had made use of this break in the game to act in a manner long delayed ; Olepi , speaking loud enough for everyone to hear , had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipi . " You appear sleepy . Go now and you will not disturb any one . "  |p439The  man had surprised her . She had not looked for Olepi in the crowd of warriors outside Zola 's lodge , in the group of young men whose glances encouragedthe betting . But Olepi had come and he had spoken . And so she moved away gracefully , the comforting murmurs of her companions more irritatingthan the husband 's attempt to humiliate her . Certainly , she had told herself , her women-friends recognize that which Olepi intends but will they understand his objection to her presence here ? The man wants either Ina or Napewaste in attendance whenever she goes out of the lodge . But those two act strict as old grandmothers about her ways of having fun . " They say that I am twenty-and-seven winters , " she had muttered to the old person who accompanied her back to her tipi , " and I know two women this same age who have grandchildren . So why will this fool woman Napewasteinterfere with my pleasures ? " Embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps Napewaste tells Ahbleza 's father that I make too many bets and so he comes looking for me . Truly , that woman brings on my difficulty . " But lying now on her sleeping robe , she found different thoughts . Perhaps Olepi yet brooded over her impudence when he hinted for an answer about the way young women regard his son . She giggled . " Why not ask me in what manner I regard Ahbleza . " Her hand smoothed the hair on the robe beneath her body as she gave herself to reflecting on this young warrior . One day soon she shall approach Ahbleza again , letting him see her admiration for his handsomeness and his quiet ways . Seven winters pass but certainlyshe remembers riding up to him after his demonstration on four horses , her eyes glowing praise . True , he rejects her approach , but on this next occasionshe intends to make her willingness more apparent . She , Hinziwin , now really-woman and ready to respond to Ahbleza 's tautness , in his body and on his face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve to shoulder and arm he owned the strength to push the most powerful bow . And his voice , soft as a woman 's in the lodge , turned out a cry  --  or so they said  --  that chilled the enemy . She understands why he avoids the paintbrush now ; also the reason for his indifference toward women . Olepi sees his son as a man among men , and so Ahbleza , seed of Olepi and inheriting the father in spirit and flesh , dares look upon only that which challenges his prowess . Hair like Olepi 's hair , she whispered to herself , heavy and long below his shoulders , hanging loose or at the back , a wide strip of horsehide holding these strands together . A body like Olepi 's body , slouching elegantly one moment , tensing for action the next . But unlike Olepi , never a boast on Ahbleza 's face , not even the paint of a boast . Certain ones say that Ahbleza looks and walks proud , but she , Hinziwin , sees something different . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoverwithin himself that which she sees . She will give him a true-reason for self-pride.  | " TIK AHPA . Tire-down . " The crier 's song had brought down all lodges before sunrise . Wanasapi ; the tribe hunts . The same governing-four who had ordered the breaking of camp at dawn also had named the Ihoka , a recently formed clubmen 's lodge , to control the hunt . After three , four seasons of observing these akicita who gave the hunts their full concern , the council had recognized the existence of the Ihokalodge ; the members had proved expert organizers . The people  --  two hundred and thirty lodges  --  moved out in their usual order , deciders and leaders front , twelve hundred Titonwan following . And managing the whole procession , four Ihoka horsebacks bearing whips . But far back of the horse herds , beyond the dust , rode those clubmen  --  Cante Tinza  --  who always guard the rear , whose members come exclusively from the Oglalahca band . On the second day the people discovered the Ihoka as most strict . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young boys to break out of line and chase after whatever they saw running , too swiftly for any women who desired stopping to beat the thorny brush that held on to the tart red berries . And certainly too swiftly for those travelers who looked for dancing or gambling at each night 's camp . " Put on your loads , " the crier called out whenever the people delayed at a rest stop . Dashing back and forth , the Ihoka whip-bearers demanded that the people stay close , not spread out as they usually walk . The Titonwan pass near any unpleasant incidents . During the third day of travel the deciders chose eight hunters  --  men who owned remarkable runners  --  to kill meat for the feeble and for those women and children who lacked a provider . Ahbleza had yearned to hear his name among these honored hunters but the summer-shirts had looked over his head when they chose the eight for this work . And then a tiny throbbing had begun in his cheek as he remembered the many horses he had made useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gifts to cripples and incompetents . " But if they wait for me to present my horses to influential voices in the council lodge , they wait for/ever . Never will I trade my horses for favors . " He had hissed the phrases inside his mouth , then ridden on , his face closed to everyone . Now , on this sixth day , the travelers saw two of their scouts riding across the near ridge , the two coming forward from opposite directions , signaling much meat . Soon afterwards , the principal Ifioka sat smoking with the deciders and then the people heard the crier announce a new formation . The hunters shall make rows , ten men wide . In front of these men , a row of Ihoka , thirty men across . And any hunter who tries to ride ahead of these Ihoka , they will knock off his horse . " Take care of your dogs , " the crier shouted to the women and children . " Any dog who runs out of place , they kill at once . " Everyone understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to raise the heads of pte . And any man who loses the meat for his people shall suffer the same as any dog who runs out : scare away pte and you never eat again ; the Ihoka had said so . Before the sun passed middle , scouts came running in , the deciders receivingthese truthbearers with a glowing pipe . And after the one had spoken , the people knew that the herds grazed as Tonweya had reported . Mostly they fed on the valley bottom in bunches of twenty or more , but some pte grazed spread thin and low on the slopes . The slow ones lay around in groups but all pte awaited the hungry people . Someone began a song that told the people to prepare a hunting camp where they stood ; the herd , over the next rise . Let those persons staying in camp spread branches on which to pile meat and make drying-racks and prepare cooking fires ; let those persons who file out after the hunters lead pack horses and bring knives and wear garments that show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ihoka began talking . The hunters shall separate into eight groups at the bottom of the second ridge , he said , and two Ihoka clubmen shall ride as watchers with each group . At a signal from the Ihoka leader  --  the man swinging a robe twice around his head  --  the hunters shall pour down the gullies into the valley ; they shall spread on each flank of the wind but the one downward from the herd . When finally they surround the pte , one group shall swing in , closing this gap on the windward side , the head clubman signaling the start of the chase at this same instant . And this clubman'sshout , the only man-sound from when the hunters start out to the moment of attack . An experienced hunter knows , the voice went on , that he shall ride in on the herd at a slant , not straight on , and that the pte will run a circle that slowly tightens . Each man shall chase whatever one he sees fit , but let him pick out a fat one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men jumped onto their runners , but most persons had chosen slim young boys to ride these horses as far as the ridge , an easy load that preserved wind for the chase.  |p442Ole|pi  , obeying the Ihoka the same as any man who hunts , chose a place in line . Then , looking around , he observed that Ahbleza stood back as if to remain in camp . Angered , the Mahto called out to him , " Will I see someone disdain work that brings meat to the lodge where he sleeps ? " The father 's reproach acted on Ahbleza similar to a blow , something that knocks in mischief . Instantly the warrior resolved to carry out the scheme he had contemplated on discovering that the deciders had ignored him ; he shall provide for someone on this hunt . And if not for the old and weak , then for someone young , someone who yet grieves a father 's death . He signaled to young Oowegica . The youth , in his twelfth winter , came up quickly ; he had imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack horse . Instead the unsmiling warrior spoke saying that the boy shall ride Ahbleza 's runner in the surround . For a moment Oowesica stood staring ; then his eyes flashed joy . But before the youth jumped horseback , Ahbleza offered advice , quickly reviewed the important things . " The dust will blind , but soon everything clears and you will see your way to the yellow fluffed-hairs . But finding yourself back of a big female who runs straight , aim at the small ribs , forward and down through the paunch . Runningalongside a curved-horn , throw your arrows at the shoulder . " The youth jumped horseback , but Ahbleza held on to the thong : " Shall you notice one who looks sideways , head shaking and tail switching , let this horse act without your guidance . He knows pte . He runs fast , dodges quickly . He keeps his ears moving and watches the group in front . " Glancing toward the hunters , Ahbleza let go the jaw-cord : " Hold on to this thong in whatever manner comes easy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the string at your middle  --  but guide only with your knees . " He smiled slightly and turning , stroked the neck of his pack horse . " I will ride this one . " The lines had formed , two hundred men ready for the chase . " I and you join the hunters . Make meat . " Instantly Ahbleza sat horseback . And now warrior and youth dashed toward an opening in the line . At the bottom of the second ridge those hunters who had worn leg-covers stripped to loin-flaps and moccasins . A quirt hung at the wrist of each rider , and in one hand each man held his bow ; in his other hand , five , six arrows . Certain gestures assigned the men to their groups ; more hand-talk sent the hunters to the heads of different gullies . And yet more unspoken orders started the meat-chasers down into the valley . The clubmen who waited on the ridge saw the men fanning out on the flat . They saw the pte , heads up and snuffing ; they saw tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumble of fleeing hoofs , the bellows of resentment and confusion , and then they heard the hunters yelling , their cries offor each kill echoing up the draws.  |p443Persons  who followed out after the hunters listened to those same glad shouts and , urging along the pack horses , remembered their work : the cutting up of those great warm bodies . True , the hunters separate the big joints , making certain that the sinewy sections stay intact for drying . But the cutting , wrapping , loading they leave for different hands . Napewagte moved quickly over the trail , the women of her lodge hurrying to keep up . " Perhaps some of this shouting means two more skins for your new tipi , " she called to her daughter Kehala . Ten moons back , Kehala had brought a man into the family lodge , the young woman 's choice pleasing to everyone . Her husband : the youth whom Wanapin had raised , Yuza , the brave boy captured during a raid on Psa camps fourteen winters past . During his many seasons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter , bow-maker , not unusual in any one of these occupations but competent to take a wife . Napewagte had welcomed the pair as members of her lodge , Yuza showing himself eager to make meat for his wife 's family and glad to join his horses to her parents ' herd . But Kehala , discovering after two , three moons as wife that she takes-on-life , had begun to hint for a lodge of her own . She held on to seven skins as a start for her tipi cover , and Napewagte , while reluctant to see these cheerful young persons go , had offered whatever more in cover-skins her daughter needed . The hunt now in progress will take care of Kehala 's wants , Napewagte told herself , providing that three , four more hides will satisfy the proud young wife . And something more : the new tipi will stand ready for use before the snow if she , her sister Ina , and Kehala work together on the hides that Olepi and her daughter 's husband bring in this day . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even this morning , watching the three make ready for the work on the hunting ground , she had called out , " I see that your son and his father will have enough hands cutting and packing meat . I shall wait here , ready with water and fresh moccasins when the man arrives . " Napewagte 's response had come quick and firm . She had answered speakinga name two wives not sisters often used toward each other but her intonationhad hung devoid of respect : " Teya , your memory deserts you . I am the one attending to the husband 's wants after a hunt . Ina will look after the meat and you will rub down his horse . And while you sit here waiting , put up the drying-rack and bring wood to the fire . " Napewagte had started off , Ina and Kehala in back , each woman leading a pack horse . And so they , if not Napewagte , had heard Hinziwin 's mocking laughter . But those phrases coming after the laugh , had not reached their cars . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , ' " Hinziwin had giggled . Halfway to the meat , Ina spoke that which irked her : " Will she look upon the blood from skinning pte as more offensive on her gown than on mine or yours ? "  |p444Na|pewaste  said nothing . Her dislike of the young wife , she often told herself , bears not so much on the woman 's laziness as on a sense of fear and envy . If ever Hinziwin births a girl-child , will not Olepi give more of his heart to Hinziwin ? As for envy ? If not envious of Hinziwin 's girl-shape and fresh young look and strangely exciting hair and eyes , then truly resentful . Certainlythe woman looks almost as young as on the day Olepi brings her into Napewaste 's lodge , looks almost as young and behaves almost as shamefully now as thirteen winters past . But certainly Olepi favors his young wife , whatever he pretends . On arrival at the hunting ground the women heard sad news : one hunter killed , a second man injured . The dead , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured man , he who had attempted to rescue the endangeredhunter . The dead man 's horse had stepped in a hole , the rider thrown and trampled ; his crushed breast had gurgled noisily but he had not lived to open his eyes . The injured hunter , knocked to the ground , had tried to sit up and ignorepain , but they had needed to lift him onto a drag ; even so the pezuta Huhupiye foresaw a quick healing . And so a wailing rose up in one place , a trilling in a different place ; they wept for the dead and sang for the recovering man . Cheers also filled the air , praise for young Oowesica . The youth had dodged a prime male who turned out in front of his runner . Witnesses said many good things about this Oglalahcarider and the horse , but they had not mentioned who owned , who had gentled this runner . And yet someone had come forward reporting that he saw the son of Olepi chasing pte , not horseback but on his own legs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the meat . The man had reported accurately . Before the ride down the gully , Ahbleza had tied his hair in a knot and unsheathed his knife . Reaching the bottom of the draw , he had jumped off the pack horse and sneaked toward a group of pte , his eyes on the big fat meat , on three who lay down . Hearing the cry that signaled the hunters to attack , he had dashed toward one of those lazy pte . The creature had scrambled onto her legs but her slow start had given him his chance . He soon had caught up and , slashing at the back legs , had brought her onto her foreknees ; the next instant his arrow had struck her lungs . He had cut his meat alone , then gone to help with the family kills . And whom will he see at once , her hands fluttering in an effort to appear useful , but Hinziwin . The whiteness of her new gown and the colorful decorations at her neck , on her arms , made her conspicuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father ignore this woman 's lack of respect for work and overlook her many imprudent acts , her inviting glances in the direction of almost any young man in camp , not excluding himself . Suddenly annoyed that he permitted Hinziwin to attract his attention  --  perhaps one reason why she had come  --  he turned from everything but the enormous shape in front of him ; he began skinning his father 's third kill.  |p445He  stripped back one half , then the second half . While removing the insides , he realized that the dead hunter 's obligation to provide for the infirm went unfulfilled . He dropped his knife and walked to where the deciders sat together , the tragedy raising a cloud that hung over their hearts . Ahbleza spoke flatly , his eyes unsmiling . " I offer meat in the place of his and so none shall starve . I desire putting my kill on the pile for the old and slow . " If his offense in the eyes of the honorable ones arose from a shortness of gifting , then let these four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything . Not a head turned , not a sound reached him but the sucking on pipes . He stood his place , arms folded , his eyes cold upon these summer-shirts who apparentlydecided once more against him . Now one of the four looked up : " The Ihoka receive meat . Different ones provide . The old and slow will eat . " Ahbleza returned to his work , his cheek hollows again throbbing . Obviouslythey regard him unbecomingly aggressive , his offer crude . But why ? Why ? A new wail spread through the air ; the women had discovered a pte with short forehairs . Whoever kills this one , they cried , will see a relative dying soon . At once the hunter spoke up claiming that he had killed from the rear ; he had seen nothing unusual about this one 's appearance . He had selected her quickly  --  a fat pte  --  and not until the finish of the chase had he discovered that he struck down something awesome . " Neither I nor any different Lakotah , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people remember that only if they eat of this meat will someone die . " Even so many persons threw dark glances at the unfortunate hunter , looks and gestures that hurried the Ihoka whipmen into the crowd around him ; they intended to renew calm before excited relatives began taking sides . Leave this pte , they advised , for the prowlers in the sky . Toward evening the stay-behinds in camp saw the pack horses coming in , the meat slung across their backs or folded inside the pte-skins , and tied on top those big bones full of sweet marrow . And they saw the deciders and the Ihoka and the Cante Tinza stopping at the council lodge , sitting down alongside a great spread of branches . Here these men will look for the hunters to throw off choice meat  --  hump and tongue  --  as they ride by , something in return for managing the surround , for putting the hunters into a position that permits the killing of three hundred pte . Napewa  --  te entered her lodge with Olepi . Proudly she removed blood-wet moccasins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she brought water , and when he had washed his feet , she dusted his toes with powder . She watched him wipe off other signs of the hunt and when he stood clean , she handed him a robe.  |p446He  lifted her face to his gaze and brushed her cheek with his palm . And when finally he sat leaning against his backrest , the woman hurried outside where Ina kept up the fire , heated stones for boiling water . But Hinziwin , not Ina , pushed meat onto the pointed sticks and laid more twigs on the burning wood . And Kehala , wearing a fresh gown , tended the cooking paunch , a sixth stone hot and ready for the near-boiling water . Kehala waited eagerly to speak of the two pte her man 's arrows had dropped , but Napewaste stood looking at Ina , who washed down Olepi 's runner . " I ask that Ina cook and that Hinziwin take care of the horse . " Hinziwin tossed her head flauntingly . " I hear you but I take enough turns at rubbing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want peace in your lodge , say nothing more about who cooks this meat . " Her voice took on a sly , warning tone . " I am not complaining to Ahbleza 's father . This man never will sit with a cover over his head while his wives quarrel about who cooks . He knows that Napewaste will remember her obligation to keep the lodge calm . A man always puts his old woman to this use . He remembers you as forty-and-one winters . And so I choose to go out and help cut meat . And now I choose to kneel here and cook . " " Stay at the fire and keep turning the meat . " Napewaste forced herself to speak quietly . But Hinziwin , seeing the woman slice thin a piece for the embers , watched warily . Her eyes said that this jealous old bone perhaps secretly intends to destroy a young wife 's good looks with this same meat knife and so she will stay on guard . Napewaste waited for the slice to cook black , then took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kehala had kept silently at her work but she saw that Hinziwin neglected the roast . The attractive young woman watched for someone , and when Ahbleza came up , Kehala understood for whom Hinzi watched . And now this one with the yellow strands in her hair seemed regretful that someone already had rubbed down the warrior 's runner and taken care of his pack horse . Perhaps her nature changes , Kehala told herself ; perhaps Hinzi really wants to help skin and scrape and cook but my mother misunderstands her . Certainly anyone who remembers Ahbleza in this kindly manner shows sign of turning helpful . Over in Cankuna 's lodge , Ogle sat in the center of much pleasing talk . The hunter 's famed arrows had stopped the breath of seven pte ; he had killed the most meat . His wife and her sisters gathered around him now , pulling off his moccasinsand feeding him warm soup . He joked with his joking-relatives and made more of their attentions than he made of Cankuna 's efforts . But the cheerful woman , knowing her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the meat and hides brought here . Her many women relativesp447and growing daughters helped with everything , and so Ogle never considered taking a second woman . More than once Cankuna had felt in sympathy with Napewaste ; will any woman really want a second wife in the tipi , sister or not ? Until the previous winter , Cankuna never had experienced any difficulty in her lodge . But then Pesla had brought his mother a sullen-eyed Palani captive , someone they call Winu . This young woman , perhaps sixteen winters , not yet practiced her captor 's dialect , and so they had given her none of the privileges they grant any captive who starts talking Lakotah . Even now Winu struggled with hides and meat , unloading horses and separating the cuts , while all other members of this lodge sat talking and laughing with Ogle . In the center lodge four deciders , thirty Moka , and a group of Cante Tinze had feasted on hump ribs flavored with melted backfat and on boiled tongue and cold liver . The hunters had provided generously ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth for the Ihoka sang out . " I have more than I eat . " The crier , speaking with the approval of each member , began to move through the encampment , inviting the people to come to the center for meat . Many persons came , not so much for the meat but to hear the Ihoka singers , to listen to songs of praise for those men who had killed and given away . Some ears waited for a song about Ahbleza , whose legs had run down pte and whose loan of a runner had carried an Oglalahca youth on a rewardingchase . But this song remained unsung . Ahbleza , attending neither the family feast fire nor the Ihoka sing , had separatedfrom the crowds as if he belonged to the dead hunter 's grieving tiyospaye . But the son of Olepi had not joined the sorrowing ; instead he sat alone , a wind-worn boulder for his backrest , a young man watching evening darken into night , watching a sky that began to flame with mystery . On such a night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky . Hanhepiwakan , Ahbleza mused , a truly mysterious-night when such colors stream across the sky ; a good night , he told himself , to ponder something that now seems to contradict meanings in that most noticeable rank : wica  --  a iyotanyapi , man they esteem most highly , the Shirt-owner , prime example . Four persons out of the whole tribe , the wise ones had said , who live the example of that which makes a people proud ; four living examples for the people to observe and perceive the effect . And then to decide , each one for himself , whether or not to follow this example . And who selects these four ? Members of the Pta-lodge , headmen whose winters count to forty or more . And who up to now owns such a Shirt ? On whom will this headman-lodge agree ? Two , only two . Wanapin , a Shirtman . And Cetan . Why these two ? Why give Shirts to Wanapin and Cetan and not to two more such persons ? Will something mysterious decide this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ahbleza glanced again at the sky . But he will not hunt answers in these colors ; instead , he chose to review his impression of two men who seemed to him as deserving as Cetan , as Wanapin . Why not a Shirt for Hehaka ? Or Iku ? Hehaka , once a warrior but for many more seasons a peaceman . Hehaka had led parties where none had fallen hurt or dying ; he had given away horses . Now , at sixty-and-nine , Hehaka danced these acts and so the headmenremembered . Certainly Hehaka held on to his memory  --  he kept a reliablewinter count  --  and yet the Pta-lodge had not named Hehaka for a Shirt . Iku , thirty-and-four , originally a Sicangu ; Iku , someone to whom more than once they had lent the summer-shirt . Born twelve winters after his brother Pasu , the young Iku had chosen to live with Pasu and his Sahiela wife who raised their lodge among the Mahto ; Iku , who had selected his wife from this Mahto band and who now sat proudly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior in the Tokala-lodge , a man who says that he will see himself naked-dead on the fighting ground before ever he will walk around camp in a robe made of bribes . But the Pta-lodge had not named him Shirtman . And now Ahbleza recalled certain phrases in the Shirt-owner 's pledge : the people shall recognize the Shirtman as a living symbol of peace , an example of mildness . Yet they speak of the Shirtman as a warrior , as a generous man , as a whole man ? Perhaps he , Ahbleza , needs to examine meanings here , the meaning of warrior , of generous , of whole . But will not everyone know what warrior ' means , generous ' means ? And what means whole man ' if not that a man shall speak his thoughts and perform his acts with the whole of himself  --  spirit and body ? Or will he , Ahbleza , not know what warrior means ? Perhaps he knows not what anything really means . He , son of Olepi , who once walks certain , now sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of restraints , a man who fathers one child , not more than two . They look for a man who has-not instead of a man who has . Has-not what ? Has-not many wives , has-not many children ? Has-not many children ? Yet they say generate ? They say that the Shirtman shall make feasts and own many ladles , that he shall give away many horses and so act that his children people the earth . ' So will the Shirtman generate something that only a wakanhca understands ? Whole man ? They call the wingflapper  --  symbol of a Shirt-owner  --  half warrior , half peaceman . Half means half , whole means whole ; will they see the Shirtman as whole ' in a manner which he , Ahbleza , not yet understands ? Will they describe Wanapin and Cetan as whole ' and say in the next breath that Hehaka , Iku , Hinyete lack something ? And that Ahbleza not yet strives for wholeness and so they ignore him ?  |p449Ahbleza  looked at the northern sky ; perhaps the same grandfathers who inspire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flicker far out in space . And here decide who shall own the Shirt . If so , let these invisibles noticethat he , Ahbleza , determines to earn this honor and that nothing  --  nothing  --  shallstop him . THE DEATH of one hunter and injury to a second had distressed those akicita responsible for the hunt . And not a man regretted those misfortunes more than Pes1a , pipe-keeper for the Ihoka . But his , a most different reason . He had intended to enact his song at the dance that usually took place after a tribal hunt . Instead they had sung only hunter songs and afterwards had listened to a bereaved family who wailed half the night on a nearby knoll . Many persons , glancing at Pegla this same evening , had seen his face darken but , familiar with this warrior 's nature , they had disregarded his querulouslook . Instead , they had remembered his most recent act of bravery , marveling again his unprecedented visit to the Palani . But members of the Tokala-lodge who looked at Pegla had recalled something different . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tokala lance six winters past . And that none had suspected Pesla 's scheme on that ceremonial occasion . The Tokala always used persuasive songs in getting someone to take hold of their clubman-lance , a commitment which meant , more often than not , losing one 's scalp . But Pesla , maneuvering into the conspicuous position , had reached for the lance at once ; he had not waited for the songs or the pipebearer'sharangue on the obligation and the risk . The Tokala warrior who previously had held the rank of lance-carrier never hurried into anything . And so certain members had poked fun at his delay , his slowness in making use of the lance . But when Pegla went at him , friendly persuasion had become stern ridicule . At once the warrior returned the lance and the gifts he had received on becoming lance-bearer . He also had withdrawn his name as a member of the lodge ; the Tokala had lost a good man . And so the rank of lance-bearer opening up , Pe  --  la had grabbed hold.  |p450The  next sunrise saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leading a raid on the Oyatenumpa . A foot-going party of seven , they had returned horseback , two scalps fluttering on the Tokala lance . Afterwardsmany braves sought a place in any party Pegla led , but Pegla preferred slipping out at night with two , three friends . Once when Sluka had asked to go , Pegla had hinted that Sluka held a more useful place among the news-actors than among warriors and that he , Pegla , intended to provide him with many choice items to enact . Pegla had ceased to attend meetings in the Tokala-lodge soon after they installedthe next in line for the rank of lance-man . Not that he had asked out but that he appeared only rarely at their feasts ; he had chosen to advance himself through a clever new scheme . The camp gossips had known exactly when Pegla , having lived as husband to Wipatawin four winters , began to notice another woman . Sharp-edged and unrestrained , these tongues usually proved the torment of the village . But they had not made Pegla squirm ; instead , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their unkempt lodges and not one had dared call out to him as they dared shout at some youth who suddenly gave attention to his hair . But within their own circle they had croaked about Pegla and the pretty young daughter of a Sicangu family , a young woman who knew the Ihoka songs , who sang for the Ihoka lodge . Wipatawin had smiled when the rumors reached her , but friends had known this smile as something for persons outside the lodge ; they suspected that Wipatawin had discovered why Pegla chose her and so she had come to know him as a man who will use any scheme to gain prestige . True , Wipatawin had blamed herself when , after two winters as his wife , she had not borne a child . Pegla had used her often enough  --  and roughly  --  but she had given him nothing to show for all the strength at his groin . Once he had reached far up inside her and , spreading two fingers , had pressed around and around until she had pulled desperately on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he had said , his black eyes narrowing . But she had lain unknowing of any different way to act . Soon afterwards , Pegla had feasted a principal one from among the Sicangu , a man with strong ties in the Titonwan hoop . When Wipatawin had come for the empty bowls , Pegla had spoken in her ear ; she shall wait on her sleeping robe , he told her , until they finish the pipe . Then the husband shall go from the lodge and the visitor with white hairs in his wispy strands shall crawl in alongside her . Wipatawin had listened , her heart aching ; she had heard stories about these old men . " Remember that he honors you , " Pegla had whispered , " and see that you please him . " He lifted her face to his cruel eyes . " Hide your distress . You provide me nothing . Why concern yourself that this old man will seed you something . " During their fourth winter together Wipatawin had made known to herp451husband that she takes-on-life . Pesla will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of himself and proud of his woman . But before the child ever came , he had begun looking at someone in a manner to set old tongues wagging . And then Wipatawin had made some desperate moves . One evening Pesla , entering the tipi , saw that she had not cooked ; he had given her a reproving glance . " Why shall I cook for you ? " she had said quietly and started out of the tipi . Pesla had jerked her arm , stopped her going . " Why cook for a man who notices a different woman ? " She had spoken her answer to the cold face that confronted her . Even so , she had waited ; perhaps she will feel his touch on her cheek , in her hair , his hand telling that she belongs to him , his true-wife , the woman who soon brings forth his child . " If you refuse to prepare food for me , I discard you as my wife . " His tone had brought her eyes swiftly back to his face ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will go to the drum and when everyone listens , I will say that I throw you away . " " You will not remember the child inside me . " Her throat had gurgled a moan . " And you will not remember my empty belly , " he had mocked . Wipatawin had not looked for him to answer concerning a different woman , but neither had she prepared for his threat to throw her away . And certainly he had spoken as one who wanted to rid himself of an unwanted woman and an unborn child . The woman 's arms had dropped to her sides . Going to the food which she had cooked but covered from his sight , she had filled a bowl . Setting down this meat , she saw that he had turned his back to her . She had crawled out of the tipi wondering where to go , her swollen awkwardnessnot something she cared to display in a different lodge . The next day she had brought Pesla a bundle ; she offered the child wearily . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bundle and looked at the small thing lying on the hide . When he handed back the infant , he had said only that the water-sac hung empty , the woodpile diminished , the soup cooled . Let her get back to her work ; he will stay . and provide . The girl-baby had grown fat and smiling during the snow moons . Wipatawinhad played with her tiny daughter and listened for Pesla 's step . They call winter the season of men-in-the-lodges , ' but seldom , a man in Wipatawin 's lodge . Then , before the snow melted , Pesla had announced that he intended to bring a certain young woman into the tipi . Wipatawin shall call the new woman teya . ' Certainly these two wives will get along as sisters ; the young woman , similar to Wipatawin , possesses a nice singing voice . Wipatawin had not answered him . But one crisp , bright morning soon afterp452this announcement , she had carried her baby to Cankuna 's lodge , asking that the good woman sit with this child while she goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandchild , had played rolling-aballwith the little one and afterwards had sung a sleep-song . But the child , instead of napping , had lain whimpering softly . But even as the grandmother felt around for whatever disquieted the baby , a loud wailing nearby the lodge had brought the woman out into the slush of melting snow . " See that none steps on my little granddaughter , " she had called back to Tacincala . Beyond the line of tipi Cankuna had seen two men who carried a big bundle , a crowd walking back of these two . But before she had moved another step , someone had come up alongside , someone who stood , many tears falling . And then a second woman , also crying , had given Cankuna the sorrowful news . The men carried Wipatawin 's body , she had told ; the new mother had strangled herself . The muddy snow beneath the tree showed sliding marks and so they knew that Wipatawin had dropped to her knees , the thong she had tied around her neck and to a branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seemed to lose her senses ; she had heard neither the grief-cries nor the comforting-sounds for the murmurs that sympathized with the warrior-husband Pala , who this same day had returned from a raid . But after a moment 's shock , she , mother to Pegla , had remembered her son 's lodge as one where two of the four great tragedies strike , two coming at once : a wife dying and a child in want of the mother 's breast . Emitting a wail , Cankuna had used her knife to cut off her braids . Dropping the hair onto the ground , she had turned back toward her lodge . The two women at her side had walked in close ; knowing that Cankuna intended to slash her arms and legs , they stayed to watch for any excessive bleeding . Hearing the story about Pegla 's return from a horse-taking , certain persons had wondered at the man 's pressing need for horses ; only something most urgentsends out a warrior before the sun dries the soggy earth . Will Pegla 's out-of-season raid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renowned warrior-hunter who had formed the Ihoka-lodge in the Titonwan camps , had held on to his uncertainties about a man whose wife hung herself . Not that he suspected every hanging ; he knew that some women chose not to endure a second wife in the lodge and that this sort of woman took her despondency to the trees , where she died with the help of the standing-people . But in Wipatawin 's suicide , floka had wondered something different : perhaps Pegla 's cruel eyes drive his wife to the woods ? He had known Ogle a long while and he respected all members of the hunter 's family  --  but Pegla . He granted that none lived more daringly , more boldly than Pegla , but he had asked himself whether or not the Ihoka-lodge wants a man of Pela 's disposition ; why not deliberate ?  |p453The  Ihoka bore a resemblance to the Tokala-lodge , differing in that the Ihoka , originating as a group whose activities centered around the chase , invited in young hunters along with warriors . Igna 's camp had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Iloka had learned of their lodge from a visiting uncle , the same old man for whom Pegla once had requested that Wipatawin perform outstanding courtesies . Looking for something to distinguish his new lodge , Iloka had decided that all members pair off , each pair painting alike . As for singers , he had chosen four young women who never had known-a-man . But if any one of the four accepted a husband , this man  --  providing he so desired  --  became a member . Aware that undesirables perhaps gain entrance into the group by this path , Iloka had proposed that a singer 's choice for husband receive the unanimousconsent of the lodge . For this reason the woman Lowansa , on announcing her intention to acceptPegla as husband , had endured a long wait before all Ihoka consented . Truly , Lowansa had considered giving up her rank as a singer with the Ihoka and returning to her mother 's lodge in the Sicangu camp ; she had wanted to avoid embarrassing the brother-lodge . Members had recalled rumors concerning Pegla 's methods in securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands acting to break her neck ; they intended to move cautiously . But different ones had spoken up saying that they had watched the warrior walking about camp in a frayed robe , the man obviously grieving his dead wife . And in answer to those members who strongly hinted that Pegla will not deserve another wife , they asked why Wipatawin had not thrown out his things ? A dissatisfied woman will put outsideher husband 's weapons and so empty her lodge of him . But what about Pegla as a warrior ? Who acts as Pegla acts and comes back in one piece ? A man finding himself in a tight place perhaps maneuvers out of his situation , but who goes looking for tight places ? Who but Pegla ? Will the brother-members not agree that their lodge-dance calls for Ihoka to mimic the grimacing flat-face who digs-with-mouth ? So why not Pegla for a member , a man all-fight , a man who looks and talks as if he will kill any Titonwan who dares disturb the meat before a tribal hunt ? And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gif thorses , presents his dead wife 's relatives with all but four of the horses he takes on that daring raid , the man out alone on melting snow , slippery ground , something most warriors never risk . IIoka had differed . " I look for a man , " he had said , " who comes into the Ihoka-lodge with clean hands . " Silence had greeted his view and so he had spoken saying that at forty-andfivehe outlives a place in any akicita-lodge . Founder of this brother-group , the Ihoka , he now retires . But he looks for his lodge-brothers to carry on in true Ihoka custom . Not one member had raised a persuading voice against Iloka 's resignation ; instead they quickly had approved Lowansa 's choice . And they had agreedp454that as soon as these two become husband and wife , they shall gift the pair in a most elaborate manner . And that Pegla shall become a member of the Ihoka at once . Soon afterwards they had held a singers-feast , the four young women presenting their difficult songs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the warrior who keeps looking at her ; if she wants him , the Ihoka lodge also wants him ; they will welcome Pegla on the day he becomesher husband . The morning after this feast Pegla had received an invitation to eat in the tipi with Lowansa 's people , who had appeared suddenly in the Mahto camp . Lowansa , a single daughter in a Sicangu family of four sons , had visited in the Mahto villages the summer before the suicide . Accepting an invitation from Hoka and his Mahto wife , she and her parents had agreed to stay throughout the warm moons . Lowansa had sung for clubmen in Igna 's camp , a group whose songs Hoka had borrowed when he formed the Ihoka-lodge . And the man had looked for Lowansa 's knowledge of the phrasing to prove helpful in rehearsing women singers for the new lodge . Lowansa had given her whole heart to the singing group . And so Hoka had encouraged the young woman  --  her relatives permitting  --  to extend her visit into the next season . But certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek out Lowansa ; truly , his dislike for Pegla had reached the point where he ceased to visit Ogle  --  one way to avoid meeting the hunter 's son , who had returned to his mother 's lodge . Then , discovering to what length things had gone , he had rushed a message to the young woman 's family . And these persons , sensing I3oka 's concern , had started for the Mahto villages at once . Pegla had eaten with the Sicangu family . And the next day he had tied two horses , their red-and-white patches matching , outside the Sicangu lodge , two big horses of ordinary color alongside . One morning soon afterwards , Lowansa had appeared at Cankuna 's lodge ; she had come to let the warrior know what pleasure his gifts had brought her whole family . And she had come in proper manner , bearing a bowl of soup , signifying that she accepts him as the one before whom she gladly will set the soup bowl each morning . She had placed the bowl at Pegla 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , gently , alongside him . Then , before he had emptied the bowl , he had begun speaking , his voice soft , almost coaxing , his hand holding onto her hand . " Perhaps you will go away with me . . . now . " Startled , Lowansa had remained silent . " I speak . I listen for an answer . " His tone , while not unkind , had lost any softness . And most certainly his eyes had revealed what answer she shall make . Even so , Lowansa had sat hesitant ; people of good name hold ceremoniesp455for these important events . " My father and brothers will see you . After you eat again with my family , perhaps . . . " " Your father and brothers accept the horses , four horses speaking for me . Your relatives know that I desire a place as son and brother to your people . And husband to you . " Pesla 's hold on her hand had tightened . " I . . . I need to find a young woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and look for one . " " You will find a singer to take your place after I and you return , " Pella had said smiling . " My parents and brothers have something they desire to give . . . . I know that the Ifioka will offer useful things . . . presents for . . . " Lowansa had demurred . " They will offer gifts when I and you come back , when you raise your own lodge and have a place for these things . " The woman had hunted more reasons for delay . Yet she knew not why . Finally she had remembered something : perhaps Pella will discover that he dislikes her smell or taste . And so he will bring her back after two , three nights away and at the next big gathering announce that he chooses not to keep her as wife . But she had not dared ponder this thing ; instead she had remembered that her brothers called him bold and that the Ifioka had approved her choice . And that the girls in camp said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found herself shivering . She had wished that this man , suddenly a stranger , let her go back to the family lodge and reflect upon this thing . But her moment for saying so had come and gone . Pella had led her toward his favorite horse , a second horse waiting . As she mounted the one tied to his , she had wondered what different move she yet dared make . Riding toward the edge of camp she had glanced around ; she had marveled that not a person seemed to notice her , none concerned that she rode off with a man . " Sit easy , " Pella had said quietly . " I am not taking you far away . " He had slapped his horse sharply and the one Lowansa rode also had jumped , almost as if this creature had felt the same stinging quirt . Pella had run the horses , but , as he had said , they shall not go far out , not even beyond view of the lodge tops . He rode smiling and he had smiled when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment his eyes had narrowed , his under lip shaping into a cruel line . Lowansa 's horse had shown fear at the billowing flap of her gown when she had bent forward to pat the creature 's face . The woman had jumped off , neither thrown nor frightened . But Pella had grabbed the horse 's jaw-cord ; swiftly he had tied the front feet . Then , holding on to the thongs of his quirt , he had struck the creature with the wood handle . Lowansa , hearing pain-cries and seeing blood ooze , had begun to wail her sympathy with the horse : " You whip enough . "  | " I decide , " Pesla had answered , but he had flung down the quirt . " I will not come here to whip horse or woman . " He had tied his horse to brush , then walked to the sandy stream nearby , enough water in the creek to splash his face and shoulders . Rubbing the drops from his arms , he had called to Lowansa . But she had stayed where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes laughing . Gently he had slapped her bottom . " Get the fear off your face , my praise-earning one . The horse will not need a second whipping and you never will need the first . " He took her hand . " Come . " As she stood alongside him at the stream , he had bent and scooped up water , lifting her gown to splash a handful high up between her legs . Next he had led her toward a path of shady summer coolness where they had sat on soft grass , berry brush circling their retreat , lodgepoles overhead , tops touching , sun shining through the branches . Lowansa saw the man 's hand touching on the grass , the fingers dark and strong . And then she had felt herself pushed gently down until she lay on her back , Pegla 's arm across the breast of her gown , his fingers stroking her neck . She had remembered back to those three occasions when he had held his robe around her . He had spoken like someone who visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not making her shiver . And he never had tried to discover her taste , something she had heard about during talks with her grandmother . She had closed her eyes ; the man 's hand had moved onto her face , followingalong the line of her forehead and cheeks , his touch saying that he regards her as a pretty woman . She had not opened her eyes but she had known when he leaned over her . And then the hand that had lain across her had begun stroking wherever her body curved , something she had felt through the gown . The fragrance of grass had intensified and different growing things had pushed forward their warm scents ; something within her had begun to throb . His hand , hunting under her gown , had found the throbbing place . The protecting thong around her thighs seemingly had loosened and she had twisted about as if refusing this personal invasion . But the earth had sided with the man , pressing as hard against her back as Pesla , now on top , had pressed against her front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had blinked open her eyes . The next instant he had flung up her gown , half her body exposed to his gaze . And then she had learned the strength of his arms ; he had pulled her on top himself , up to his mouth , where he had tasted her for sweetness . Rolling her back on the ground , he had spread her legs ; and so she had discovered the strength of his hands . And then she had known hardness and push and pain , all in the same moment . She had seemed floating away , unknowing where ; and so she had shed a tear . Stars had drifted past , each tiny bright sun beyond her reach . She hadp457tried once and again to touch even one and when they all had disappeared , she had laughed a crazy little laugh . The air had seemed filled with a strange new fragrance , something more than flower-smell , more than creature-smell . And gazing up at the dark heads of the tree-people , she had touched her own face and hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had seen where Pesla lay as if asleep . She had reached out her hand and touched him , touched something wet and sticky that now belonged to her . The man , feeling her touch , had smiled . Not opening his eyes , he had reached over his hand and touched where his hardness had visited her , touched something wet and warm that now belonged to him . And so the warrior had made Lowansa his wife . These two had not returned at once to the encampment ; instead they had gone visiting among the Sicangu , the woman 's relatives welcoming the pair in their lodges , gifting this man and wife with robes and hides and meat and a horse-and-drag for carrying back these gifts to the Titonwan hoop . Everywhere they went , Pesla had appeared eager to keep his wife within sight . Lowansa , seventeen , had worn a colorful tie around her gown , something to show off her pleasingly wide hips below a small waist and fully ripe breasts , her shape and pretty face certain to attract glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , custom permitted crude joking betweenPesla and certain ones among his new affinal relatives , jokes that had led to much teasing , laughing . The son of Ogle had displayed a remarkably good nature , and Lowansa , seeing none of the frightful temper he had turned on the horse , had begun to wish that Pesla stay with the Sicangu , that they raise a lodge here on the earth-smoke . Then suddenly Pesla had spoken , the warrior saying that they shall start back ; they had lived away from the Mahto camp from round moon to round moon . And so the next day , the two had begun traveling north . The Ihoka lodge had given a feast for Pegla and his wife upon their return , and the pair had received a tipi cover along with many different gifts . And so Lowansa had everything she had wanted for a lodge , from backrests  --  even a bone backrest for Pesla  --  to painted containers , perhaps enough meat folders and robe-holders for the next two , three winters . Joyfully the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , then waited for Pala to bring his little girl , the daughter of his dead wife , into her lodge . But he had not brought the child . When she had asked for a reason , he had answered saying , " You will give me a son and perhaps a daughter . Let the girl stay in my mother 's lodge . " He had mentioned his mother 's apparent pleasure in her grandchild and he had told of the many ways this little one resembled the small daughter who had died choking . Lowansahad not dared say more.  |p458Soon  the young woman had discovered that her husband stayed easy to live with only when things went entirely his way . But let him lose his meat during the chase or hear someone dispute one of his schemes and then his anger boiled as on the day he had whipped the horse , a glare in his eyes and a growl in his throat . Certainly she had endeavored to please him . Her grandmotherand mother had taught her that a wife shall accept the husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man asks that a certain woman becomes his wife , custom gives that woman the privilege of refusing for her own reasons . But once she accepts a man , she accepts his nature and without intent of making change , neither in the man nor in the child who shall bear a piece if not the whole of his nature . Lowansa had noticed also that Pesla 's most disagreeable moods came after he attended a meeting in the Ihoka-lodge ; in some mysterious way these clubmenhad a way of arousing his surliness . The woman had made a true observation . The man returned from each gathering of the Ihoka in a temper that invariably upset the tipi ; they had not promoted him to the rank he desired . Rattle-carrier , club-owner , lance-bearer  --  he had held those ranks in the Tokala and he intended to hold a more impressiveplace among the Ihoka . They used his wife as one of their singers and they had honored him with many gifts ; yet at the feasts he sat alongside the ordinary members . And they had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable to painting exactly as he painted ; to walk in the Ihoka procession he needed to find one person willing to imitate him . This rule and one more rule the Ihoka emphasized : the members shall live as brothers , none quarreling nor giving reason for a quarrel . They had hinted more than once that Pella especially remember this never-quarrel rule . The warrior had awaited , then , the old-summer feast at which they gave promotions , but they had not promoted him . And so four days afterwards , Pella had walked away from camp , taking along a party of four . The group had known only that they headed toward the Palani villages , perhaps a raid for horses and a demand for maize . Certainly none had suspected that Pella hurried north to the maize-planters ' camp in search of smoke for the Ihoka pipe . The Ihoka , when preparing a pipe-bowl , desire cuttings from leaves which once had their roots in a Palani village . Such leaves , the members told , make a sweet smoke , and whatever tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable . This same thing , they said , applies to woman . A water creature had provided the original smoke for the Palani pipes  --  or so their legends hint  --  and after a while the tribe had offered seed from their plantings to the Psa and the Titonwan . The Psa had made use of this offering , but the Titonwan had not troubled to scratch the earth and wait for the sacred stalks ; instead the Titonwan went on using a red bark handy in every camp , peeling the wood thin and curly for quick drying . But these peelings called for the taste of Palani leaves and so each Lakotah party going amongp459the Palani for trade or to loot brought back a twist , something to cut and mix with the red bark . Not Pesla . He had schemed to bring himself into prominence among the Ihoka provided that he and his party managed a safe return ; he intended to bring back whatever the Palani keep under guard pertaining to their pipes : stalk , leaf , root , seed . His four companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not wanted different ones along . The warrior had invited two Ifioka  --  drumkeeperand lance-bearer  --  and he had invited Nuge , the horsecatcher . The fourth member , a youth desiring a certain young woman but lacking the war honors , had accepted eagerly . Pesla had picked these men carefully , each one holding an exact place in the scheme but none aware of his assignment until within sight of the enemy 's mound-lodges . Going out on foot , they had imagined what Pesla wanted each one to imagine : they go out raiding for horses . The group had covered ground quickly , moon and weather helping . Then at a rest stop near the Palani camps , the leader had revealed his intent and given instructions . Nuge 's eyes had brightened ; he had seen at once where the party needed an expert horsecatcher . The two Ifioka had sat amazed at Pe  --  la 's slyness : the man had advanced his group beyond the point of anyone 's return , anyone 's pretense at an ominous dream . But the drum-keeper had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking sharply at Pe  --  la , " you will remember that if an Ifioka falls , his brother-akicita go at once to his help . " " I remember , " Pesla had answered dryly . " And you will remember , my brother-akicita , that none in the parties I lead ever falls . " The leader 's cold eyes had turned contemptuously on the fourth member , but the youth 's look had said that he will follow Pala to the finish , even jump over a cliff if the leader calls for such a jump . The pipe emptied , Pesla had hurried his party forward . The man led , not looking back ; why turn to see if they come ? He had known when he decided on these four that they will listen to him , each one for his own reasons . The youth had crept toward the smoke-leaf patches outside those ditches that protected the Palani villages . Stakes and brush surrounded the plantings , and here the young brave had crouched to keep watch . His , a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nuge had gone off in another direction , Their work , someplace different , but they also had a most important assignment ; Pesla had said so . The leader and the lance-man , hunting a place to hide on the open ground , had seen neither tree nor stone big enough to lend a shadow while they watch for Nuge 's signal . And so these two had needed to sit remarkably quiet while they waited out the night , the moon round and teasing . And never a cloud to offer relief for their cramped legs , stiff necks.  |p460At  dawn four Palani women  --  two old ones , two young  --  had climbed through the broken stakes and onto the planted ground . They had come for a morning 's work , to cut leaves and stem and make up bundles . The young , daughters to the two women , had talked and giggled while they sliced down the stalks , hacked off leaves . And so the mother of one had advised that her daughter attend to work or the men will have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . They lie on mats and scratch their heads and . . . " The girl had made this much answer when suddenly somethingcut off her words . A hand had covered her mouth and a knife lay across her throat . At the same moment a strange voice in awkward Palani accents had told the startled women that they shall not cry out ; one sound and the knife cuts off the girl 's head . The same voice had gone on saying different things in a roughly spoken dialect but the meaning had come through clear and fast . The astounded workers then saw that the two enemy who had sneaked up stood naked as their own men on a warm day . But noticing the lance in the hand of one , their astonishment had turned into fright . Next thing , they had heard the voice telling that many Titonwan warriors hide inside this staked place , branches shielding each one . If the women look  --  moving only their eyes  --  they will see where branches sway gently . These warriors carry arrows for throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers consider asking for help . The Titonwan sit impatient as any Palani for something in their pipes . And on this occasion the Titonwan come after bundles of smoke , not twists . Pesla had taken his hand from the girl 's mouth . " Start your foolish chatter as before . Say nothing suspicious . " The warrior had spoken these phrases fluently ; let these women know that he will understand everything they say . " Gather up the stalks . Carry these bundles to where someone leads you . " When the women 's arms embraced a full load , the youth had come from back of the osiers and , slipping among the burdened ones , had begun directingthe bundle-carriers toward a slope of ground . The rise concealed captors and captives from the view of anyone who walked through the village but not from the sight of some sharp-eyed Palani who sat atop his mound-lodge . Or from the sight of anyone who kept a day-watch over the gatherers . And so Pegla , staying in the enclosure , had made certain that whoever looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvers nor glimpse the crouching form in their midst : he had sent the lance-man to walk joking and laughing at the front , as something to distract . The drum-keeper and Nuge had stood guarding the place these women put down their bundles , each man holding a horse , a hand on the creature 's nose to prevent cough or snort . Here the youth stayed , tying the bundles onto the horses , the drum-man helping in this work while Nuge calmed the horses . But the women , as instructed , had returned with the lance-bearer to pick up more loads , the naked Ihoka walking front as before.  |p461Pella  had stayed hidden in the enclosure until they had removed all bundled stalks and leaves . Instructing the lance-bearer to hold the women back of the slope along with the horses , the warrior had waited for the five to reach this place safely . Then , openly and naked and alone , Pella had walked away from the planting-ground . He had moved slowly , climbing the slope in full view of any villager who looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marveled such daring . But when he had come alongside the horses , Pesla 's eyes had reflected displeasure ; why only two horses when he had advised five ? He had glared at Nuge , but the horsecatcher and drum-keeper , instructed to start out once they tied all bundles horseback , had sat ready to go . And so Pella had waved off these two even as he began scheming for the escape of the three remaining members of the party , three persons without horses and facing open , flat ground . And the sun halfway up the side of the sky . As the horsebacks rode off , Pesla 's quick gestures had signaled that which he had taken only moments to decide . And so they had killed the two old women , the knife making quiet work on one , the lance on the second woman . And before the look of terror had faded from either pair of dead eyes , the killers had lifted their scalps . Then , while the red edge of the knife held the two young women in stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed women 's gowns . Swiftly they had cut the sinew halfway down and so made something to pull over a man 's shoulders and stretch to below his knees . Pella had tossed one to the youth , motioning that he shall wear this garment . The secondgown , Pella had put on himself . The lance-bearer , daring to wear nothing that restrains , had stood naked as before . The three had started out , the girls nudged along , Pella muttering threats in their ears . But before this group had taken many steps , the camp-dogs had begun running out , yapping noisily and chasing after the escaping raiders . Acting on his own choice , the lance-man had hung back to throw stones , but his attempt to drive off the dogs had proved futile . He had estimated ten dogs to every Palani and that half the pack had rushed out after the Lakotah ; neither knife nor lance will silence this many dogs . Pella , his eyes unnaturally bright and his face strangely colorful , had managed to shut out any distractions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack horses grazing in the near distance , legs loosely tied to prevent wandering . And certainly Pala knew ways for urging such horses into amazingstrides , into a lope that carries a man swiftly away . But in what manner will he reach these creatures ? Walking in a woman 's gown hampered his movements . He had smiled grimly at the sight of the young man who stumbledalong in front of him . Then , suddenly , he had seen the next moveHe had spoken to the girls , not daring to risk signs ; he knew that the yappingdogs had directed some eyes to the flat beyond the slope " What happens to the old women , happens to you if you signal the village . " But the girls , walking alongside him , had seemed numb . He had needed top462arouse these two instantly . " Attend . Bring horses here . Bring two pack horses or you will bleed on this ground . " To his relief , the girls had hurried toward the grazing herd ; they had not looked back nor signaled an alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or more of these creatures snapping at the lance-man 's moccasins , the Ihoka not deigning to notice . And then Pesla , his eyes roving the earth front and sides , had seen that a man approached , someone who moved toward the awkwardly advancing group . Perhaps a horse-tender , he had told himself , someone who comes in from a night 's watch over the herd ? Or perhaps a scout who will notice each detail and see that these two women ' walk in the manner of men and that they wear Titonwan moccasins , a scout who will signal instantly to the mounds . And so Pesla had known that within the next moments either he and his companions become horsebacks or they try making their way back to the center of the Palani village , to the big mound that grants safety to any stranger who reaches this lodge before the villagers kill him . Either way , the chance not much . The girls , leading two horses , had moved reluctantly toward Pesla . Or so the warrior had viewed their approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Titonwan ; certainly they schemed to delay the horses . But standing close to danger always had exhilarated Pala ; he had intended to make the most of this experience . Tearing off the woman 's gown that covered him , he had sprung forward , then run bounding toward the horses . " Mount or die , " he had yelled in a dialectneither Palani nor Lakotah but instantly understood . " Keep together , " he had shouted as the girls mounted . Rushing up , he had leapt onto the back of the near horse . He had caught the girl rider as she started to fall , pulling her into place front of him . Forcing this horse against the side of the second , he had given a kick which sent the second horse into the path of the lance-bearer . And the Ilioka , grabbing hold the mane , had jumped up in front of the girl . The Lakotah youth , hopping along as if he wore leg-ties , had tried to reach this same horse . Suddenly he had pulled his woman-gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pesla had seen the lance-bearer strike the Palani girl , knocking her off the horse . The next instant the youth had jumped up back of the Ihoka . The approaching Palani man , near enough to see what occurred , had given a warning cry and run back after one of the pack horses ; apparently he had intended to give chase . All these happenings had acted upon Pesla in a manner that incited him to grab on to yet more danger . Whirling his mount , he had rushed at the girl whom the lance-man had knocked down , someone injured but struggling to get on her feet . Scarcely slowing his horse , Pesla had swooped down , his sharp knife lifting hair from the shrieking , crumbling form . Then , kicking hisp463horse into a startled run , he had held aloft her bleeding scalp , his war whoop bursting in the ears of the near-crazed captive he held in front of him , this one clinging to the mane and gurgling foolish laughter . The lance-man and youth , riding double , had stayed ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him shouting , telling wind and sky that he viewed all Palani as women born to provide for the Titonwan , to plant and bundle smoke for the Lakotah , to grow maize and squash and to mold colorful beads into ornaments for their proud enemy south . And they had heard him fling foul taunts at the Palani who chased after him . Pella had rejoiced at the noise that came from across the ditches ; he had known that he aroused the whole village . He had pictured even the most lazy jumping up from their mats and different ones rising up from where they squatted on the men 's ground , everyone suddenly aware that the Titonwan had carried off their bundles of smoke and killed three of their women and captured one ; five Titonwan raiders , one a youth , accomplished all these things . Pella had imagined the Palani winter count along with the Lakotah remembering this event , the picture saying only that Pella and four warriors visit the Palani in the moon of yellow leaves . For a while Pella had ridden indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse . He had schemed to throw her at the enemy if anyone among the pursuers had come close or to drop her somewhere along the trail . But noticing the sky-color beads along the edges of her gown , he had found new thoughts . Why not the beads for Lowansa , he had asked himself , and the girl for his mother , another pair of hands in Cankuna 's lodge , another back to bend over hides , bend down for wood ? He had turned the girl 's head for a view of her face . And even as he had laughed into her terror-stricken eyes , he had seen that once they wash off the thick dust cover , they shall find a face almost respectable . Wisely , then , he will take her to his mother 's lodge , not to Lowansa ; enough that one wife hangs herself when he mentions bringing in another woman . Applying quirt and heels harshly and unrelentingly , Pella had used up his horse before he had reached the place of reunion with the other four members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke-leaves on their horses , the lance-man , and the youth . But he had not sensed any concern ; he had seen the Palani turn around , none choosing to pursue , the maize-planters perhaps suspecting a big party of Titonwan at the edge of the flat . And so , leaving the horse to limp off somewhere or to die where standing , the warrior and girl had walked the short distance to the meeting place . And as they walked , Pella had imagined a spectacular return to the hoop , each member of his party wearing victory paint and singing . And once back in camp he had imagined more songs and much dancing , the bands marveling that which Pefila and his companions had enacted . And finally , those members of a certain akicita-lodge pondering in what manner they shall award one who brings bundles of smoke direct from the Palani to the piecep464of flat wood on which they cut for their pipe . And Lowansa , their favorite singer , managing the hint that awards Pegla a most high rank among the Ihoka . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which he had envisioned on the day he had determined to make Lowansa his wife . The Ifioka had welcomed brother-members on their return from the smoke-leaves raid , songs of praise for each one . Certainly the lance-bearer had fulfilled his rank ; certainly the drum-keeper had brought new pride to the Ifioka . As for Nuge , the Ihoka intended to invite him into their lodge next summer . And a certain young brave , one who had used his knife to take hair , now had dared approach the lodge where lived the young woman he wished to make his wife . Listening to the recital of Pesla 's acts , many Ifioka had recalled their misgivingsconcerning this new member , these persons quick to sound assent when the Ihoka whip spoke saying that Pesla had earned the one important rank open at the moment : keeper-of-the-pipe . The drum-man had approved loudly , almost too loudly . Among the Ifioka the drum-keeper , not the pipe-keeper , sits on the governing council . Knowing that they will award Pesla something , he had desired seeing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat below him , he dared refuse Pesla 's invitations without offending the warrior . And truly he chose never again to go out with this one , Pesla 's schemes too daring for his blood . Lowansa 's hand had reached eagerly for the shining beads , but her eyes had stayed on the Palani girl who stood at the tipi flap awaiting someone sayingwhere she belongs . Lowansa had not wondered that Pala visited the Ifioka lodge before returning to his own after the raid , but she had puzzled why he waited outside her tipi with a strange girl , someone whose head drooped , whose hands clutched the sides of her gown . " My wife , " Pesla had said smiling , " I see you looking at each thing I bring back . But now see what I prize most . " He had flung a scalp , stretched on a little hoop , at her feet . Stooping , Lowansa had picked up the hair , her eyes again turning toward the girl . " I consider offering you two scalps for the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had glanced briefly at the captive  --  " shall keep her hair . She has more use as a helper in my mother 's lodge than as a scalp on the pole you carry to the dance . " Lowansa had sympathized with the girl . " If my husband permits , " she had murmured , " I will bring his captive water for washing and a fresh gown . " Pesla had not permitted . " Let her find the stream and look after herself . She will not risk running away . But more important I weary of the smell of Palani . I prefer looking at my wife , who brings water and new moccasins forme.  |p465And  so Lowansa had attended to those things that Pella desired on his return . Afterwards the man had leaned against his backrest and begun the story of his raid on the Palani . The story Lowansa had heard on the day Pella returned from the Palani camps , she had heard again and again  --  at the scalp dances , in the Ihokalodge , and always in her own lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling her husband 's story , each one reciting the events exactly as Pella recited , inflection and gestures the same whoever spoke . Now , after a winter and a summer of these repeats , she had begun to find the story a bore . Occasionally she managed to escape a retelling , but whether or not she sat listening , always she saw someone who compelled her recollection of Pesla 's experience ; always somewhere near , the Palani woman they had named Winu . Sullen and silent , Winu cast an onerous shadow in Cankuna 's lodge , acted on Lowansa as an irritant . Another person hearing the Pella story repeated and repeated had grown weary of the recital and the extravagant praise that accompanied each recital . Ahbleza had seen Pella raised up in a new warrior-lodge , had watched Pella riding in front of each hunting camp , had observed Pella moving forward in the center lodge , finally to that side where the important warriors sat , next to the truly big voices in council . Pella , someone who had exhausted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abused kinsmanprivileges , broken kinsman-rules , and schemed beyond decency . Certainly , Ahbleza told himself , many different persons observe that Pella makes up his own rules . So what happens that the wise and honorable in the band acclaim the aberrantand reject the custom-abiding ? Will the **26;6579;TOOLONG toleratea permissiveness that he , Ahbleza , not yet understands ? Will the leaders say that he , Ahbleza , walks clinging to old ways while different warriors advancealong some new path ? Will a change occur in the warrior-image ? What about Wanagi ? Certainly the sacred-man will see that something changes , something that will not relate to the grandfathers now or back at the beginning . Or will Wanagi change along with the change ? Ever since the season of Ahbleza 's vision-seeking , Wanagi and the son of Olepi had experienced little contact , Ahbleza quick to perceive the sacredman'sindifference toward him . Even so , the warrior had wished more than once for the sort of visit they had enjoyed in the past . But aware of the unlikelihood of more such meetings , Ahbleza had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand barefoot on sun-warmed stone . Here he had demanded that one among the invisibles lend him understanding ; he , Ahhleza , someone who demands to know why the Lakotah change , what things this changing improves.  |p466THE  TITONWAN bands , each snuggling along the warm back of the earthmotherhill , welcomed the snow season . Not only will their own bands competein the ice-games but this winter they shall enter into contests with the Sahiela . These friendly people had clustered their lodges on a nearby stream , the two tribes within easy visiting-distance , the black hills embracing the two different tongues . But any Titonwan going out to mingle with his Sahiela neighbors discovered a drooping tribe , none with the spirit for racing over the hard ground or sliding rib-bones . They had lost their laughter , not even the heyoka bringing smiles into their camps . Thirty-and-two Sahiela warriors , all brothers in an akicita-lodge , had died fighting on muddy creek this summer past . Not twenty Sahiela women wore hair long enough for braiding and all Sahiela displayed grief-marks . Soon those wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Titonwan villages , visitors had told , the women coming to show their sorrow-scars . And the warriors who accompany these women , intend holding out a red-stem pipe , each man 's face a plea for Titonwan help when they take revenge , when they move against the Psa . And so the Titonwan , recalling that the Sahiela once come to their assistance , began to consider a position . Mahto warriors and their wives along with people from the Siyo and Oglalahca went to visit the Sahiela camps , the women of these tribes mingling their tears , the men heating up their blood . But certain Titonwan sat with the old Sahiela , choosing to listen in on peace talk , the son of Olepi one of this group . Here Ahbleza learned more about the Sahiela rules for living together , more about the Sahiela plan that provides for a council of forty-and-four , persons who advise for ten winters before different ones take their places . " This way the people see forty-and-four councilmen , each one giving unsparingly of himself . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose yet one more who keeps a remembrance of things happening in the past . This rememberer acts to relate whatever the council contemplates top467something similar that occurs in past seasons . And so the counselors and four principals make their decisions knowing what most likely will happen . " The old one who had spoken had used his eyes and hands to help along his tongue ; he seemed eager that his visitors understand . Ahbleza had sat most attentive to this speaker . He recognized the Sahiela camp circle as twice the lodges in the Titonwan hoop ; the Sahiela owned the strength on the plain . So if he listens closely to this old man , perhaps he shall discover the source of Sahiela strength , discover whether the power resides in those four arrows sacred to the tribe or in those fifty different acts that make up their thanks-offering ceremony or in this governing plan which a woman brings to the Sahiela . " Tsistsistas , " the old one said now , " Tsistsistas , the true-name of this tribe whom the Lakotah call Sahiela . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lakotah said that they heard this swishing-sound in all the Sahiela speech , a swishing they likened to the scraping noise of grass stalks . But the meanings in their words interested Ahbleza , not the sound . A Tsistsistas , the speaker said next , regards nothing more important than the comfort of those persons in a lodge without the husband-father , a lodge wherein the enemy cuts down the provider . And along with this concern for a family in need of assistance , a Tsistsistas recognizes the importance of keepingpeace within the band . Let a man speak softly , act gently in his own village , but let him remember himelf as grizzly once he goes out among the enemy . Looking on the strong face of him who spoke these things  --  a grandfather who had sat in the council of forty-and-four  --  Ahbleza decided that these Sahiela , in the manner of the Lakotah leaders , also wait and see what the day demands , a man wholly peaceful or wholly warlike depending on whether he sits with family or walks out to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself , he will come into a clear understanding of what the Lakotah look for in a Shirtman . " The fifth man , he of the remarkable memory , " the Sahiela revealed now , " tells that the Tsistsistas once live on stony ground , tall-ears hopping and bounding all around , also many fat skunks during the old-summer moon . And so the people pile up stones for shelters and kill those small creatures for meat and coverings . " When finally the Tsistsistas travel , they live for a while on barren earth , where they use the name sandhill-men . ' Next , they move alongside certain big lakes ; here they eat the food that swims . And instead of wood for fire , they burn the tall grass which they tie into long bundles . And here , slender branches of the white-wood provide their shelters . " Afterwards the Tsistsistas wander into the woods . They carry clubs and bows and kill big meat . But a different tribe carries firesticks , something that keeps the Tsistsistas at a distance and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsistsistas cross onto the short grass . Here they settle down in earth lodges along certain streams . They plant maize along quill creek perhaps fifty winters , along earth-lodge creek half as many . Twice during these planting seasons Tsistsistas and Lakotah camp together . " And now Ahbleza understood that the Sahiela had wandered even as the Dakotah , Lakotah had wandered and in similar manner : from stony earth to barren ground to trees , from dry to wet , from warmth toward cold , from the hills onto the flat . Perhaps the Sahiela grandfathers and the Dakotah grandfathershad met in those ancient seasons of traveling everywhere . And then Ahbleza remembered that the Oyatenumpa captives told stories of their grandfathers who had moved around and that the Witapaha captives recited similar stories . Will all tribes travel this earth from the day they make feet ? Legends told that all the creatures had roamed the earth until each nationhad found a place with which they sensed agreement . And that even the seeds had blown with the wind until , finding where they wanted to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakotah , neither creature nor seed , perhapshad experienced something more marvelous : perhaps all tribes exist as one tribe at the beginning , one great people who live without an enemy . Returning to Napewaste 's tipi , Ahbleza had pondered his visit with the old Sahiela . The man had mentioned a tribe who live where the sun rises , a people with a governing council of fifty , certain women in the tribe selecting these men , one woman acting as observer , ' keeping watch over any new man among the fifty . And now , wanting to know more about this eastern tribe  --  these Wasuhula  --  the warrior decided to make frequent visits to the Sahiela camps , talking with his peers but listening also to the wise old ones . And something more : within this camp , unlike his own , he dared anticipate a warm welcome , courteous attention . The next day Ahbleza sat with members of the Barelegs family , with their shield-maker and his son . The young man , near Ahbleza 's age , had carried the shield into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his infant grandsonwill carry this same shield , not as something that turns aside lance or arrows but as power born of one man 's vision and passed along generation to generation . " See the war-bird 's feathers and those grizzly claws hanging on the shield , " the old man demanded . " These things lend swiftness and toughness but only to him who knows the song that comes with the shield . " Afterwards Ahbleza talked with persons of a different family who also owned a shield , a Sicangu family who had lived a long while with the Sahiela and spoke two tongues  --  Sahiela and Lakotah  --  persons who informed the son of Olepi that many tiyospaye owned shields but that a man will know only the shield-song of his own village . The power , then , not in the shield but in the vision that provides the song ? But I , Ahbleza , am a man with a vision ; why will I not own a song for exercisingmy power ? Perhaps Wanagi denies me something , perhaps he gives Tonweya a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason ,  |p469Ahbleza  sat scheming a visit with Wanagi during which he shall demand answersas to his own vision , his own powers . Then calming himself , Ahbleza decided to visit the lodge of his warriorfriend , a friend of his boy-seasons . None called this person Moksois now , perhaps none remembered different names he had used during his youthwinters . But everyone knew his man-name : Ohkohmkhowais . Meaning traveling-dog , ' the Sahiela said . And so a Lakotah shall call him Miyaca . Miyaca had greeted Ahbleza with a boylike smile that said they shall begin their talk as they always had begun their play , the two picking up wherever they had left off . And so their words and gestures concerned horses , none among the Sahiela a more remarkable horsetaker than Miyaca . But the horses Miyaca took came most often from the ungentled herds running in the sandhills , not from the gentled herd outside some enemy camp . " Not that I am reluctant when they ask that I join a party going out to raid the Pani , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing those creatures who roam the sand . Or obtaining my horses through trades with the Witapaha as you name the island-butte tribe . I also trade with the rattle-tail people  --  Sintehla-wicasain your tongue . Such horses put a vigor in the blood of my herd . " Next , Miyaca began describing his recent experience on the river of hides , Witapaha and Sintehla and Mahpiyato along with certain Sahiela families , all making one great winter village . And twice  --  twice  --  ten thousand horses in this same camp . Ahbleza sat uncertain that he comprehended this many horses in one place . Yet he had heard that the Sintehla brought back from the true-south as many as ten hundred in a single raid . He envied Miyaca his winter in this trading village of six , seven hundred lodges , a gathering that will not welcome Titonwan ; the Lakotah had made enemies of two of these tribes . Silently the friends smoked a second pipe , then Ahbleza spoke abruptly : " I am not accepting any invitations to join a warrior-lodge . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce a similar decision . But Miyaca made surprising answer : " Perhaps my friend lacks none of those things a warrior-lodge provides . Perhaps he considers that he has enough . " Enough ? " Ahbleza 's response came too quickly . The Sahiela 's eyes widened slightly . But then his hands expressed the meaning as if the alien tongue had made difficult Ahbleza 's understanding of the word . Enough of anything , he signed . Enough honors , enough horses , enough friends , enough meat . His lips formed a pleasant , easy smile . But Ahbleza sensed that Miyaca had meant something different . " Perhaps you lack but one important thing . " Miyaca 's hands repeated his words ; he wished to make certain that the Lakotah comprehended . " You not yet take a wife . "  |p470Ahbleza  smiled . " Not yet . But I see this comfortable lodge and so I know that you find a good woman . " The Sahiela answered speaking softly : " Perhaps soon you will sit alongside a certain woman and so you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused ; he again used sign-talk to emphasize his speech . " If you find difficulty choosing from among your own pretty women , my friend , I know of many modest , quiet ones among the Tsistsistas . " He leaned forward , looking strongly into Ahbleza 's eyes . " The people will make you a good Tsistsistas . " Ahbleza understood that Miyaca honored him . The Sahiela had seen something in the son of Olepi that had brought forth a rare invitation : Miyaca proposes that Ahbleza take one of their women and so come into the tribe . The warrior 's eyes acknowledged the honor even as he answered Miyaca . " Certainly I shall look for a woman who walks proudly as your women walk . And who knows ? Perhaps I shall find a woman who mixes Lakotah and Sahiela blood , her father of one tribe , her mother of a different tribe , a daughter who possesses the most desirable characteristics in my tribe and yours . " Ahbleza laughed shortly . " O'ko wayelo . I only make noise . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a little drama of the story he had decided to tell . " I will not pretend , " he said , using gestures . " I encounter such a woman as I describe when I recently visit a Lakotahfamily who lives with your tribe . Her father , a Sicangu ; her mother of a family whose speech sounds like your speech , a family you call dwellers-onthe-ridge , ' or perhaps you say stay-back-on-a-ridge ' people . But , whatever her band , never will I have this woman . Not even if she speaks fluently my tongue and your tongue . For her two young sisters live also in the lodge and I am not bold enough to entertain three women at once . " Ahbleza rose to his feet . He liked to separate from a friend with smiles , if not laughter . And now he saw a smile that began in Miyaca 's eyes . " Any warrior I know , " Miyaca teased , " waits in line outside a young woman 's tipi , wondering whether she will grant him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friend , sit inside a tipi that shelters three young women , any one of whom gladly will go with you . Things come too easy for you . " Walking back to his own camp through the biting cold , the Mahto warrior felt the smile fade from his lips . Things come too easy for him , his warriorfriendMiyaca says . But Miyaca knows not of the ignoring , the indifference he endures among his own . Perhaps you have enough , Miyaca tells him . True , he has enough , enough of this tribal testing or whatever they call this treatment that pounds at his lacks . Will they decide that I lack courage , he asked himself now , when they discoverthat I listen to peace talk in the Sahiela camp ? Or that I lack daring for reason that , until now , I prefer my mother 's lodge to one of my own ? If so , let these testers observe closely when I join the Sahiela who avenge theirp471dead . And if afterwards anyone says I hang on to fears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters , something that really takes courage . A rush of shame prickled his neck . His thoughts , something in which a foolish boy perhaps indulges but not a man with a great vision to guide him . Truly , the day arrives when he needs talk with Wanagi . Wanagi had listened . He had heard that which Ahbleza said and that which the warrior had not said . When Ahbleza spoke of not owning a song , the wapiya advised that he remember why a man sings . And who will stop him from composing his own song ? And then a long silence had filled the space between these two who smoked , the warrior seemingly unaware that Wanagi replenished the bowl twice , the sacred-man smoking the third pipe alone while his guest gazed into the fire . When finally Ahbleza spoke again , he spoke firmly : " I will accept only that which I understand . Everything different , I call mystery and wait for under-standing . " Wanagi , making answer , used surprisingly soft tones : " Certain things a man shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed a little sigh . " The son of Olepi not yet convinces me that truly he has enough . " Enough ? Ahbleza 's heart jumped . His Sahiela friend had hinted that he has enough of everything . But what means enough ' when this word sits alone ? Will he misunderstand meanings in his own tongue also ? Aroused , Ahbleza replied heatedly . " I say I have enough , enough of enough . I have enough of distant faces and rude backs . I have enough of disrespectfrom ones who call me relative , call me friend . I have enough of personswho dare imagine that they decide whether or not I ever shall own the Shirt . I  --  I  --  will decide about the Shirt . I will decide this thing and everything that happens to me . " Again Wanagi responded in soft , even tones : " The son of Olepi will not hear me when I say that he has not enough . " Now Ahbleza 's eyes filled with puzzling . But after a moment he spoke : " Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , trailing down my back . Even the Sahiela knows that I have enough horses , enough . . . " He stopped himself . " Perhaps you , my father-friend , will tell me where I lack ? " Quickly , gladly , Wanagi 's answer came . And in a single word : growth . " Growth , " he repeated , and passed the pipe to Ahbleza . A good had come from this talk with Wanagi , a good to which Ahbleza had not tried to give name ; he simply enjoyed the effect . And so for a while he walked oblivious to any slights ; he intended to make the most of the remaining snow moons . He joined now in the winter games , whipping the cones on icy ground , trying to outbump , outspin the young boys . He threw the short horn-tippedp472feathered sticks and hurled the long sliding-wood , trying to outdistance the young braves . And he played hoop-and-pole with men old and young who found their fun in rolling wood-circles on bare , hard earth . The women spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even on his unsmiling days the eyes of the young looked after him or tried to fit into the steps he left on the snow . And when he sat horseback , men and women glanced up . But never will he wear something that draws attention to himself . Not wanting to rattle when he walked , he never tied strings of shells at neck and knees . He kept his person bare of ornaments and his face  --  but for his returnsfrom war  --  bare of paint . He arranged his hair simply , the heavy strands clumped and tied at the back , some hair falling forward over his shoulders . He pushed a wingbone into the thick portion , one fluffy feather hanging from the bone and showing back of his ear . Moccasins , loin-cover , robe he wore proudly , but only his robe truly marked him . Not another man in the Titonwan camps wore a robe that picturedhorses who lope or prance or rear up , each creature in true-color . Only Ahbleza had painted blood-red the expanded nostrils of horses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decorated his robe with horses who show the strain and sweat of the chase or with horses who lie down or appear in a roll , a black tail and mane to identify the ordinaryhorse . The people long since had discovered that Ahbleza intended to resist the flat picture and so they had become accustomed to his shapely look-alive horses , not scrubs but true Titonwan horses  --  smooth , vigorous , alert creatures . And none dared say now that Ahbleza 's bold brush will bring harm to this warrior or his horse or to anyone riding in his party . Truly , certain warriorshad wondered whether Ahbleza 's power came directly from the earth 's paint-stones , the brush his protecting-mystery . But Olepi never had taken this view . The snow moons melted away , and Ahbleza sensed an impatience with himself ; he hunted ways to demonstrate that he recognized growth as the grandfathers defined growth . Not enough growth , Wanagi had said ; not enough growth . And where will man grow but in the spirit , into the Whole . What new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces the Whole ? In what manner shall he act and so expand that which they call the true - self ? Will proving generous widen his true-sight ? Giveaways demonstrate generosity , but horses , robes , such gifts  --  merely the symbol . Perhaps if he searches the truth back of these generating acts . . . ? Search for the truth ? The grandfathers say that truth flows in gently ; they say that spiritual growth happens slowly , nothing a person will recognize until a change comes through one of his senses , usually the sense of feeling . Afterwards different senses will tell him something.  |p473But  perhaps he will find the guidance he needs in a review of his youth 's vision . Why seek a vision if not to possess an enduring guide ? The red-stem grasses  --  grass that pte never eats  --  sat tall on the plain , brightening the vastness , renewing someone 's intentions . And so the Sahiela prepared to move the sacred arrows against the Psa . Why wait for old summer , the true-season for raids ? Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now while the influence of a winter 's visiting between Tsistsistas and Titonwan endures . Everyone goes . The arrows move and so everyone moves . Will the Titonwan move with the Tsistsistas and their sacred arrows ? Zuya , a big party of Titonwan will go . Takpe , the Titonwan understand ; they go out for blood . They will ride toward the powder river remembering the creek where thirty-and-two Sahiela stand off the Psa for two days . But die in a hand-to-hand fighting . Never before will Ahbleza see women preparing to fight . And when he heard that these Sahiela women rival the men as fighters , he smiled back at something which , fortunately , he had voiced only to himself ; taking ten Sahiela sisters will not mean ten wives in the lodge but instead one big war party . This laughter at himself had acted as a strengthening force , and when he rode out with the warriors , he rode as if he alone carried the trust for this revenge . The Lakotah sat camped on one side of the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the edge signaled that he had clubbed down a Psa . At once the avenging party rushed out ; they intended to discover the Psa camp before dark . At dawn they attacked a village of one hundred lodges . But their war whoops had brought out only stumbling old men and some middle-age persons . The Psa warriors had gone out looking for Sahiela blood , a handful of competents staying back to protect women and children . Yet one of these Psa , defending horseback , had proved brave as any young warrior . Three Sahiela finally cut him down , but he had heard their cheers before he fell . A Sahiela woman-warrior , the third person to touch his dead body , had cut off his arms . Her brother 's arms and legs , she told , had hung from the side of a Psa 's horse for twice seven days while this enemy danced his scalp along with the scalps of thirty-and-one more Sahiela , The fighting had not finished in the Psa camp . While the Sahiela and Titonwanwent about gathering up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable women and children  --  warning cries reported the return of Psa warriors . At once the avengers jumped back on their horses . Sweeping down on these unsuspecting Psa , they killed many , many more of the enemy than the thirty-and-two they had gone out to avenge . Ahbleza returned from the fight with nothing more than the red feather of a wounding to show that he had entered in the avenging . An enemy lancep474had gashed his side deeply , but he had stayed horseback , his arm pressed tightly against the wound . The bleeding had weakened him , a fall not unlikely had he remained in combat . But moving out of the way , he gave help to certainSahiela who , unfamiliar with the enemy 's tongue , experienced difficulty in chasing off the old Psa women , unwanted as captives , viewed as nothing more than extra mouths to feed . Afterwards he had returned to the edge of the fighting ground , his eyes on one man . He had seen Tonweya leave his place among the scouts and rush into the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bore down on the Psa , the brother-friend exhibiting the same boy-spirit he had displayed during his youth-encounter with the Palani . But now Tonweya maneuvered his attack skillfully , putting to use the awareness of his man-seasons . They say that a scout fights when they need him in a fight , but on this occasionTonweya had looked for a fight , for a chance to warm up his blood . Or so the scout had laughed off his impetuous entry into the avenging . But when the warriors told their kills-stories at the dance-fires , two men spoke saying that they had seen Tonweya strike an enemy with his hand . And so the leaders called on this scout , asking that he recite his act . Tonweya , obliging , heard a long trilling and loud cheers at the finish of his dance , but his real joy came when he saw Ahbleza 's approving eyes . " I speak , now you tell something , " Tonweya demanded . The scout had returned to the ridge after he had struck the Psa ; he knew nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ahbleza 's side . The warrior 's lips curled perceptibly , his expression bearing a remarkable resemblance to his father . " Shall I say , misun , that I am slow at eluding the lance of one too old for the Psa war party ? Shall I stand proudly in this dance circle and tell that I chase some old Psa women out of their camp and herd pretty young girls into the captives ' line ? Your glance touches on my wound but you look , misun , at an injury too small for remembering . " " They will not give the red feather for a scratch . " " Perhaps not , but will you hear the leaders asking that I recite ? " " I ask . And I am someone who leads . " Olepi 's sudden appearance had not startled these two , but his look , which hinted at finding boys in mischief , annoyedthe warrior-son . When Ahbleza seemed not to answer , the Mahto spoke again : " Perhaps you will let a father tell what they say about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained silent . " I hear , " Olepi began , " that my son rides a path through the middle of an enemy who stand defending their lodges . He carries neither shield nor lance . The old Psa who wounds him comes out looking for a fight to the death . Someone recognizes this old Psa as a leader they recently displace . " My son holds together a bleeding side while maneuvering his horse beyondreach of curious eyes . Sitting alone , he treats his injury . Next thing , he rides alongside the Sahiela , helping run down Psa who try to escape . " Mostly true , but not the whole story , Ahbleza grimly recalled . But for anp475eagerness at seeing myself the big man in this show , the old Psa 's lance never will touch me . I am aware of whom I attack , but I intend never to receive a wound . And so I act to avoid injury instead of instantly knocking down a desperate old enemy warrior . Ahbleza had not spoken this recollection , but Olepi , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall influence this warrior at the moment , neither he nor Tonweya . The man stood enclosed , an invisible hoop shutting out everyone , everything . And so father and friend , saying nothing more , wisely moved away . The tribes had ridden back from the avenging most noisily , the clubmen cheering loudly all warriors who had killed , the Psa captives wailing loudly for all killed Psa , moans and cheers blending with wails and songs when the night 's dancing began . But once these grieving Psa women dried their tears and started talking in their captor 's tongue , they had much to gain . Always these tribes make wives and daughters of such captives , the Psa women receiving the same respect they accord any woman who lives in Lakotah or Sahiela villages . For never will man disregard the meaning he gives to woman : one-whosits-most-high ; wife , one-who-sits-above . Wankanl yanka , one-who-sits-above ; wakanka , wife . While different men contemplated taking a wife or making a daughter from among these Psa captives , Olepi lay on his robes remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dared throw away one of his three wives . Certainly he will discard the woman in a ceremonial manner , he told himself , a separation that will gain him not only approval but prestige . A tribal leader , they say , shall remember himself as one who gives-away , who limits himself to the bare essentials . So the people see him giving away horses and hides and meat , but if the people see him giving away a wife , they see that he gives away something that sits above everything . THE VICTORY-CELEBRATING came to a finish and the Sahiela moved off , these people taking most of the captives , half of the horses . And now the Titonwan bands came together in an intimate hoop , the women raising their lodges nearp476the river of the thickwoods , a place between the black hills and the big mudwater . Isna , favoring this campground , brought his Kuya band into the circle again this summer . And now he looked for a permanent place in the hoop . Olepi , hearing that the Kuya wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kuya together will keep Zuzueca and his noisy relativesfrom winning a place at the horns . The Oglalafica held on to this distinguishingsite , Tanazin a strong leader , but if ever the Oglalahca lose the position , Olepi intended to see his own band , not the Kiyuksa , in this place . Mni  --  a 's band , as always , raised lodges near the Kiyuksa , but these redwaterpeople once again came as Sicangu visitors , and so they lacked any true power among the Titonwan . And if Olepi manages to draw the Kuya leader  --  a man with many strong families back of him  --  to his side , who will dispute the Mahto when he demands the horns ? The Titonwan seated more men in the center lodge this summer than ever before and so they tied together three big tipi , forming an impressive half-circle . And again the akicita-lodges required considerable space , these groups locating their tipi as from the start : Tokala and Iyuptala at the back , Cante Tinza and Kangi Yuha at opposite sides . And for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoop , these clubmen occupying a site near the Kangi Yuha . All five lodges of clubmen had begun collecting feathers and paint , hides and rattles for their ceremonies , each group also waiting to hear whom the center lodge had chosen to watch over the encampment . At the moment the Iyuptala prepared for the sash-wearers ' ceremony . The two who presently owned the sashes had fulfilled their obligation during the recent attack on the Psa . Not that an enemy camp empty of warriors providedmuch of a proving ground , but as anyone who ever wore the sash will say , the real courage shows in the resolve to stake one 's self . Certainly the sash-wearers who now resigned had not looked for a mild test but neither had they regretted that their stakeout occurred in an almost empty camp . None of the members yet knew who will wear the sashes next , but Olepi had proposed that the Iyuptala welcome Isna as sash-wearer . Pointing to himself as an Iyuptala whose voice they had respected for ten winters , the Mahto leader had urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had asked that the members overlook those customs that apply to a young man who becomes a pledge ; certainly they will not send out Isna for meat , something he shall snatch off a drying-rack , nor will they have him run errandsin the manner of a boy-brave . And why not these acts , certain ones had asked . They see Isna as a strong leader among the Sicangu , but let him show himself as a strength among all Titonwan . If the man has good intentions , he will perform whatever acts they require of any pledge and will not consider age or prestige as something that grants him privileges . Eventually the members came to an agreement ; they will inform I  --  na thatp477the lodge desires him as sash-man . Recognizing his importance among Lakotah , they offer him instant rank in this akicita-lodge , this brother-lodge of principal Titonwan . And so they ask that he send feathers and quills for use on something he will wear , an act that will signify his acceptance . Next day the Iyuptala herald , acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing happened . Olepi grew impatient when five , six days passed . He wondered whether this man had received different invitations , the Tatanka-lodge perhaps asking Igna into their group , this headman-lodge whose members yet ignore Olepi , the Mahto leader eligible for eleven winters now . Olepi dared not show his distress in front of the Iyuptala , but in his own tipi he had maintained neither the impassive countenance nor the controlled speech . He twice complained when women-friends came to sit with Napewa  --  teand Ina ; these women talk too much , he said . But he lingered inside the lodge if only to differ with whatever anyone said . " Perhaps I and you wisely take this work to another lodge , " Ina told Napewastequietly ; " talk and laughter displeases someone . " But Napewaste , who had lived the most seasons with Olepi , refused to let his mood drive her out of the tipi . She answered her sister cheerfully : " He will turn , " she said , her hands rubbing the skins she softened for summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going someplace different . Then came the day when the Mahto 's dark mood proved too much for this true-wife . He had pushed aside the new moccasins Napewaste had made him for the Iyuptala ceremony , had spoken sharply . " Why not make me a pair that fit ? These moccasins pinch my toes . " " I am unaware that my husband 's foot grows . " She had not intended disrespect , but neither will any woman who prides herself on knowing , at a single glance , the true length and width accept such criticism graciously . " Change your talk , " he said brusquely , " or you become a woman whose husband throws her away . " Napewaste 's fingers tightened on the skin-piece in her hand . " I understand , " she said , her voice unnaturally brittle , " that custom approves a woman who puts her man 's things outside the lodge when his moods displeaseher . " At once Olepi arose , going out of the tipi . Alone now , the woman 's foolish words came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin-piece but they refused to work . And after a while her shoulders slumped , a moan breaking out of her heart as she bent to the ground . Olepi slept four nights in Hinziwin 's little tipi but not to his young wife 's delight . His presence interrupted her visits with women-friends and her games with distant relatives who stayed for the summer . And he sent her on many errands , demanding that she return promptly.  |p478  " Who keeps you away from this tipi ? " he asked one morning . " Will you meet women on the water-path as lazy as you ? " And then he sat her down to making new moccasins , something he wanted to see her finish before dark . She began her work pouting , then resorted to a little whimpering . When Olepi looked her way , she used her amazing eyes to hint that he remember the pleasure her body always gives him . And so he took the unfinished work from her hands . And she , relieved of something tedious , spread herself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawn abruptly , his suddenjerk making her wince , her wandering attention quickly brought back to the man lying at her side . From the start the Mahto had made Hinziwin understand in what ways he liked his pleasure and until now she had proved a most satisfying mate . But an indifference had entered into her manner with him , and while he knew his power for putting a stop to this negligence , he suddenly wondered whether he cared enough to trouble himself . Turning his back to her , Olepi recalled the way Napewagte even now responded to his touch . Too eagerly , perhaps ; a woman shall remember herself as the submissive one . Then why will he go reluctantly to Ina 's robe ? In her he finds the truly submissive . But always Ina showed a fear of him and , disliking fear in anything  --  warriors , boys , dogs , women  --  he found himself tempted to use her harshly . And so he stayed away from Ina 's robes but for the occasional visit that custom demands when a man takes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked , so far as he knew , none of a young man 's potency ; any woman will lie proudly with him . Not exactly any woman , certainly not one who runs loose , but any woman of good family . And so why not someone among the Kuya ? Who says only one way for making a brother of Igna , for gaining a loyalty , for strengthening a tie between Mahto and Kuya ? Since Ahbleza rejects the akicita-lodges and so refuses important connections , why not his father acting to increase the prestige of the Mahto band ? For Igna to become his brother through the Iyuptala , one way ; discarding a woman in his own lodge and taking a Kuya wife , a second way . But he will use this second scheme only if Igna refuses the Iyuptala invitation ; not gladly will he throw off one woman only to take on a different one . Even now he will wonder what happens to his reasoning that he finds himself with three wives . His irritation flared again ; why consider that Igna will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning to look at Hinziwin , wondering why he found her wanting on this occasion . The woman , sensing that she had displeased the man , began slowly and immodestly to pull up her gown , to her neck ; she will expose a gleaming nakedness , breasts firm and tall , flat belly , shapely legs . And not so much as a scratch to mar her fine , smooth skin . Let him look ; owanyake waste . Hinziwin , twenty-and-eight and certain of herself as a joy to view.  |p479She  felt a strong leg flung across her slender thigh , then a familiar hardness . Eyes closed , she hid the woman-power smile ; let him imagine that he subdues her and not the other way around . Olepi had walked directly from Hinziwin 's tipi to the Iyuptala meeting place . Approaching the lodge , he saw a group of women famous for their quilling . His heart quickened ; perhaps Isna had brought hides and quills to these women and so they decorated something for the Kuya leader . Coming close , Olepi saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh side of a robe . And now Olepi smiled . The Kuya , deliberatelyslow , finally had showed with hide and trimmings , the man remembering to bring also the wing and tail feathers from a rain-bird , something important to the Iyuptala costume . And so Isna evinced his intention to make ceremony the next three mornings in front the Iyuptala-lodge , to appear with glowing embers on his palm and to lay those embers on a pile of sweetgrass . And on the fourth day , at sunrise , to make use of this sweetgrass smoke for purifying a new robe , an Iyuptala robe . Afterwards , the Kuya leader dared look for the Iyuptala-lodge to honor him as a new member , to mention his name in speeches at an Iyuptala feast . But one man , Olepi told himself , shall walk away from Isna 's honoringfeastcarrying a leg and foot of the rain-bird in the fold of his Iyuptala robe . And his lodge-brothers , seeing this sign , will know that this man  --  leader of the Mahto camps  --  endures that which tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife , a woman for whom he feels great fondness . They will say that Olepi demonstrates outstanding loyalty to the bands : he lets go a desirable woman , the tribe replacing this wife in his affection . They will say that anyone will let go a horse or a herd of horses in the name of a relative they choose to honor but only a most strong man will let go a wife in the name of the tribe . Or so Olepi answered an obstinate spirit who kept telling him to recognize his act as that of an ambitious leader ; that Olepi , remembering his age , grows weary of waiting for an invitation into the headman-lodge and so he uses this extreme to recreate his image as a tribal father , as someone who earns a place in the Pta-lodge , in the Tatanka-lodge , a place he awaits eleven long winters . A man discarding a wife who bores him will hit the drum during a break in the dancing and then announce the separation . But the man who vows to perform the throwing-wife-away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members had said so . They say that a man performing this ceremony demonstrates a remarkable will . They say that man takes woman for but one natural reason : making-achild . And so whoever dares not let go his woman after she bears once or twice , responds more readily to impulse than to reasoning , something that flatters neither the husband nor the wife.  |p480Truly  , these akicita ask , will any man sit ready for war once he starts living with woman , his belly never empty , his robe always warm , his moccasins without holes ? Will not such comforts soften him and so he goes out reluctantly , the rigors of the warpath not as enticing as in those seasons when his companions , men only ? Or perhaps he will not often go out , claiming that he sleeps with his wife on the night before a war party , his presence on the warpatha risk to himself and the warrior-group . Will a man , once he mates , ever really stay outside the influence of woman ? Certainly say the Iyuptala , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead the ceremony honors the woman . For a man who demonstrateshis will-power in this manner , dares throw away only a wife he truly , truly esteems ; the more desirable the woman , the more praise-earning his act . But who , Olepi had asked himself , shall decide the most desirable wife in a lodge that shelters more than two wives ? Who but the man wearing the moccasinsknows which pair fits comfortably , which pair drags ? The soft-voice woman who keeps an orderly tipi , who cooks and quills and mends will give the appearance of a good wife , as will the modest , neat woman who attends to the child . But a man wants a wife in whom he sees more than a lodgekeeper , more than a child-tender . When a man sits alongside but one woman , he needs decide only whether to keep or discard . But when he sits alongside three women , the people observeclosely whom he discards . And a man who uses the throwing-away ceremonyto rid himself of a distasteful wife but claims something different loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man of standing , then , who ceremoniouslythrows away a wife shall make certain that the people recognize the greatness of his intention to become as a father to the people as a whole . OLEPI STAYED three nights in the Iyuptala-lodge . Then , after witnessing the next to final day of Isna 's ordeal , he returned to his own . He had decided to ask Napewaste to ride with him through the midmorning brightness ; perhaps they will discover a fragrant glade , a nice place to rest or talk . Or in some way prepare her for that which he intends . Seeing the man approach the tipi after seven sleeps away , Napewafite made herself remain attentive to her work on the hide , to the quick , glancing blowsp481she struck with her whitening-tool . But her fast heart warned of a need for invisible help if the husband returned only to remove his things from her lodge . Now , aware that moccasined feet stood close , she awaited the voice that will lift her face . When he spoke , his phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw silent thanks to whatever kind spirit had sent Olepi back to her lonely self . She smoothed her hair , changed her gown , and then , getting on her horse rode close behind as Olepi led the way out of the village and along the treelinedstream . Before the cooking fires had cooled , these two had come riding back . The woman went inside the tipi at once , but the man turned his horse and rode slowly toward the woodpile where he had seen Ina loading herself with sticks , her horse already burdened . Here he stopped , helping the woman spill off the wood , then gesturing that she mount her horse and follow him . At a hidden place among trees that bordered a sandy creek , his eyes orderedher down . And now she stood wondering why he brought her here , what thing he will ask of her next . Raising her face to his look , she suddenly recalled the day he had asked her into the lodge as his third wife . He took her hand kindly now and led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew for what reason he wanted her here . They lay together on warm clay , his manner gentle . And so she dared enjoy herself as never before , her body experiencing more pleasure than in those seasons when she sat as the one wife in a Sicangu lodge . But she lacked the forwardness to tell Olepi , when finally he pulled her to a sitting position , that she gladly will linger on this sandy clay for so long as he will hold her . But they sat only a little while , the woman silent , this day mysteriously bringing back memories of her daughter who had died before becomingwoman , a pretty girl who never had known what exquisite joy the womanbodywill give the woman-spirit , a joy that Ina herself had not fully recognizeduntil now . Laying aside these memories , Ina had smiled as she sat fingering the sand . Olepi had called her a fading woman , saying that she worked herself too severely . Now , her cheeks glowing , she saw him spit onto crumbling redstone , making the paint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told her . She pressed her fingers fondly to his wrist as he made the red smudge on her skin ; she remembered that a husband paints the wife he esteems . But on feeling his hand pull away , she sensed those familiar trembles returning . Not for reason of any unkindness but that he had displayed , instead , an effort at kindness , almost as if he intended never to see her again . Olepi separated from Ina at the place he had met her , the woman staying to collect the load of wood she had dropped on his arrival . The Mahto leaderp482returned to the Iyuptala-lodge , to eat with the members , to sit for a pipe . Or so Ina had understood him to say . The two sisters ate disinterestedly this evening , neither one talking . Then , having wiped clean their bowls , they began to prepare food for the Iyuptala feast next day . Together they cut up tipsila for boiling , Napewaste filling the containers in which these roots and the meat will cook , the woman deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove certain pieces of meat at the moment of tenderness . Ina had begun different work ; she squeezed the fresh , plump ten-seed berriesfor their juice . Next , using a fine root-powder of her own making , she thickened the juice , pouring slowly , avoiding lumps ; soon after sunrise , she will prepare the meat-balls for floating in this sauce . Before dark , Ahbleza and Tonweya came in from a little hunt , the two offering their kills for the feast . They threw down the tails of five who swimwith-stick , not enough meat for an Iyuptala feast day but something to blister , then peel and cut in small pieces for boiling with the prairie-root . And so the wives carried their work from evening into night , the son and his brother-friend sitting for a smoke with Leksi , the young men listening courteously to the old man 's recollections . But Ahbleza sat also aware of his mother , the young warrior observing apprehension in her movements , a concernon her face . But why , he will not understand . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having reviewedthe installing ceremony , awaited the drum-keeper 's approval ; they gave this good old man who never had killed anyone the final say on the affair . But the drum-keeper chose instead to talk about a new rank in the Iyuptala-lodge , advising that they introduce the rank of whip-bearer at the ceremony next day . Different lodges have this rank , he said , but none use the whips in the manner he will propose . The old man proceeded with details , the young members alert and showing a real interest . But Olepi grew impatient with the drum-keeper 's harangue ; the Mahto had a different place to visit before this night turned old . And yet he who had put up Isna 's name as one of the new sash-wearers scarcely dared walk out on a meeting that concerned the installation . And so when Olepi eventually left the Iyuptala to walk among the lodge-shadows toward a certain little tipi , even the rain-birds had ceased hooting . The little tipi , empty ; Hinziwin , not here . Olepi glanced around for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay stopped his searching look ; Hinziwin will not return for three , four days . Nor will he reach her  --  a woman isnati  --  in any way . He stayed for two , three more looks around her tipi . Here , a gown she had discarded , something thrown to the ground for want of cleaning . But thenp483Hinziwin never had troubled to remove fat or berry stains ; always she left the cleaning of her gowns to Napewaste or awaited the offer of skins for a new one . Also on the ground , those moccasins he had demanded she finish at once , moccasins yet without bottoms . But will he not take the pair from her hands to use her in a different way ? Usually this disorder annoyed him , but not now . Instead he stood center in this pathetically small lodge , remembering her slim red-yellow body , pretty as a turning leaf . He saw her eyes at the moment a laugh broke through her delicatelycurved lips . He seemed to hear that laughter now even as he smelled the fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remember those yellow strands in her hair that gave her the name Hinziwin ; Hinziwin , Hinzi , mitawin . He wondered who had made this loud cry . Then understanding , he became angry with himself . And so he gazed calmly upon each personal item  --  her gown , moccasins , hair-ties , the robes where she slept  --  until he saw these things with complete indifference . But stepping out of the tipi , Olepi knew that this feeling he called indifference he shall more properly call numbness , perhaps craziness . For even now he told himself to give up two wives before ever he throws away a certain one . Walking toward the edge of camp , in need of aloneness , he remembered that they will jeer a man who reclaims a woman he once discards . But the thought will not disturb him . For one thing , he had not told anyone of his intention to perform this ceremony , and so , if he wished , he dared put aside the whole scheme . But if I take this step and throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suffer any regret . Whatever different ones imagine , I never shall give up that which I desire but for something I desire more . And so I act knowing that above all I want to sit in the Tatanka-lodge . I see this discarding-wife ceremonyas the most startling way to show to what extent I will go in demonstratingmy loyalty to the tribe . Yet I gain nothing if someone hints that I use this ceremony as a cover for quitting a woman I find distasteful . And so I shall make certain that the wife I discard appears in the eyes of the tribe  --  if not my own  --  the woman most difficult to let go . In the eyes of the tribe ? Once before , he had tried looking out on someone with the eyes of the tribe only to discover that man shall look inward when he wants a true answer . He stopped at a boulder along the trail and , leaning his back against the stone , he pondered himself . Only now will he recognize that when he performsthis ceremony next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns him a place in the Tatanka-lodge . For when he discards this woman  --  knowingall along which wife he will throw away  --  he truly becomes as an old herd-father . And perhaps as lonely.  |p484Iyu|ptala  . For more than twelve winters these lodgemen had raised their big tipi at the rear of the summer hoop ; Iyuptala , they had said , at the back and facing the entrance in the manner that a family seats the honored guest . Iyuptala , the akicita-lodge that had originated the throwing-wife-away ceremony ; Iyuptala , they had said , the most demanding lodge in the hoop , attractingonly the most enduring of warriors . Olepi , a member for more than ten winters . The Iyuptala had welcomed the whole encampment at the installation of the two new sash-men but perhaps the prominence of the one  --  everyone seemed to know that Isna , the Kuya leader , had accepted  --  accounted for the tremendous turnout this day . None of the spectators had any difficulty picking out Iyuptala members ; they either sat in front of the akicita-lodge or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone had said , will introduce youths , age fourteen and fifteen winters , whom the lodge had agreed to take in as new members . Olepi , among those Iyuptala who sat , remembered that his preference limitedthe Iyuptala to men of rank , not boys , but most voices had spoken for young blood . The Mahto leader once looked forward to seeing his own son an Iyuptala , but Ahbleza had expressed his disinterest in joining any lodge . And so the Mahto wondered now whether Ahbleza even sat watching . Certainly he knew that his father , a pipe-man , will present the sashes and recite a killing . But knowing and caring , two different things . Olepi put a hand wearily to his mouth . He longed for the finish of this affair , perhaps the final Iyuptala ceremony for him . He had come in from the edge of camp at dawn , going directly to the brother-lodge . Here he had painted his forehead in the manner of an Iyuptala , then taken his place to await the ceremony . In keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any Iyuptala eaten for four days . They awaited the feast for the initiates , but Olepi knew that he will not sit at any feast this day . He looked among the women but saw none of his own , not even Kehala . Then he remembered : one wife , isnati , dared not attend , and the other two wives perhaps had gone looking for extra meat bowls , attending to whatever pertained to the feast . But now he saw the herald rising , going forward to meet someone . In the near distance two men walked slowly toward the lodge , a tiny smoke curling up from the embers sitting on their palms . The sash-man ceremony had begun . Napewaste had not kneeled with the women at the cooking fires this morningnor had she walked with those relatives who went out to collect bowls . Ina had glanced up surprised on hearing her sister ask that Kehala take the feast food to the men . Then , observing that Napewaste stayed on her sleepingp485robe , cheeks unpainted , Ina 's surprise became concern ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lay exhausted . But after accompanying Kehala to the feast ground , then working in Napewaste'splace as bowl-stacker , fire-tender , Ina wondered something different : will Olepi hint at his recent pleasure with the sister-wife ? And Napewaste , suddenly jealous , intends staying inside her lodge until Olepi comes looking for her ? Never before had Ina considered competing for the husband 's attention , but now , the only wife helping with these feast preparations , she schemed to make herself henceforth more attractive to the man . Her lodge empty , Napewaste pulled out the strong cord she had hidden beneath her sleeping robes . Her head bowed as she struggled with the ache in her throat and the cry in her soul ; certainly , she told herself , a woman will not grieve her own death . She had made her decision even before she sat eating meat with Ina the previous day , even before she had left the glade after Olepi gave warning . She will not desire living if she loses him . And will Olepi not hint at this thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to prepare her for a surprising act , something that will occur during the Iyuptala ceremony ? Truly he intends discarding a wife and certainly he implies Napewaste . What different woman will he mean when he talks about not wanting to offend a wife and mother , someone he trusts will understand why he acts in such manner . The woman had not answered Olepi in the glade , nor had he said anything more all the while they sat together , his hand covering hers . But she had discoveredmany new thoughts about Olepi during that silence , each one making her sad for herself and for him . Olepi , she had remembered , came on earth as all newborns come , hunting the love each infant knows to look for . But an enemy had carried off Olepi 's true-mother , the only one to shine-a-light that he will recognize at birth , identifyas love . Different breasts had fed him , and so , growing up , he had sensed fondness for some persons , esteem for others . But lacking the true-mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving love as the ultimate joy  --  Olepi not yet realized that which love most fully empowers : self-respect . Napewaste had reflected only briefly her own life ; enough that she bore a son and raised a different woman 's daughter , enough that she lived forty-andtwowinters , more than half her seasons as Olepi 's wife . And certainly none will grieve her dying but a handful of old women to whom Olepi will give presents in return for a day and night of proper wailing . Or so Napewaste , the death-cord in her hand , saw the picture . But now , before she lifted her head , someone gently pulled on the cord in her grasp , someone whose moccasins she recognized . And so she knew that Ahbleza stood here.  |p486For  a long moment the son gazed into his mother 's face , all those unspoken things of his young-man seasons in his eyes : a gratefulness for her understanding of his strange ways with brushes and horses and warriorlodges , a respect for her many good ways , her skillful hands . His look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform , but his eyes refused her the privilege of this choice ; he will not permit that this woman take her life . He touched her fingers , waiting for each one to unbend , for the cord to drop into his hand . And now he gestured that she come with him . And she , as one walking in a dream , followed where he led . She found herself taking a place among the women who gathered near the Iyuptala-lodge . She heard a familiar voice and knew that Olepi spoke to the encampment , but she closed her ears to his words . She noticed that certain men received sashes and feathers and robes , but she stood unheeding which men became new members . If anyone observed that the wife of Olepi acted as one stunned and that her son stood curiously nearby the women-group , they had not made gossip . But who will notice these two ? All eyes watched the new Iyuptala or those singers who now approached the drum . Eight men stood around the big red Iyuptala drum  --  four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that supported the drum , and four known as **30;6640;TOOLONG . Almost at once they began singing but they had not touched the drum ; they waited for the old drum-keeper to step forward and strike the hide and then present a horse to someone . Her heart despairing , Napewaste also awaited the drum-keeper . She had looked once , fearfully , toward the half-circle where the Iyuptala sat , their painted faces stern and unfamiliar . Above their heads a stuffed rain-bird perched on a branch , something they used during a thanks-offering . But the bird seemed to stare at her and so she had looked away , a new chill in her heart . But the man who approached the drum , not the old keeper ; instead Olepi came forward , beater in hand . Hunhunhe . Many persons mumble surprise but not all ; this same instant Ina understood the unusual tenderness of Olepi 's visit . Her hand went over her mouth ; shocked and frozen to her place , she stared at the man alongside the drum . She saw his body pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She saw his cold face , something neither sun nor fire will warm on this day . She saw the wood in his hand , the small piece of stick he will throw toward the men saying : this piece for my wife , for the sister of the mother of my son . Whoever catches the stick gets the woman Ina . She wanted to run , to hide and lose herself forever . But she stood unmoving , not certain whether she had imagined that Olepi spoke these phrases or whether the man really had told his desire to discard her . Her eyes on the lit/tle stick , she waited unbreathing for the husband to lift his arm and throw the wood anywhere , for anyone to catch . Napewagte saw nothing ; her head had bowed at the rumble of the drum . Help me , her heart begged the powers . Give me strength , my mother the earth and my grandfather the stone . Make me strong and so I shall endure that which husband and son ask of me . Slowly she lifted her drooping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood to Igna , leader of the Kuya and new member of the Iyuptala . Napewagte 's quavering little cry told that she saw Olepi using her as he will use a horse , as a gift for someone whose favor he intends to secure . The woman 's eyes sought Ahbleza as if in some mysterious manner the son will stop this thing . But Ahbleza stood smiling . Napewagte 's hand covered her mouth even as her sister Ina remained with hand clasped over lips . Ahbleza approves that which his father decides ? He will see his father discard his mother , the son smiling while Napewagte enduresthe cutting of her heart into strings ? And will he keep on smiling when the Iyuptala walk through camp after the feast and sing the throw-wife-away song ? Her head again dropping , she recalled the words of this song : My son 's mother , you listen not . And so you go . ' " This stick , " she heard Olepi say now , " for my wife . A new Iyuptala will send this one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ina put her fingers in her ears but Napewagte suddenly raised her eyes , her fears mysteriously gone . The strong voice of the Mahto seemed unchanged as he named the woman he will give Igna . " The one they call Hinziwin comes to you . " Igna , a cunning in his eyes and a smile on his lips , accepted the stick . And Olepi , his face like stone , stepped toward the back of the Iyuptala-lodge , four Iyuptala walking close to him . Napewagte had managed to stay on at the feast , her hands ladling and carryingmeat , setting down bowls . But only her hands , alive and caring . Ina went at once to the lodge of relatives , where she planned to stay awhile ; she chose to avoid Olepi and her sister for the next two , three days . And she wanted tongues wagging neither at her nor about her . After the feast , everything clean and orderly , wives and mothers of the Iyuptala sat as a group to watch husbands and sons perform the lodgedances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not stayed . She returned alone to the family lodge , where she stared dully at the tipi lining and pondered in what manner Hinziwinwill receive this news . Or perhaps , she told herself , the woman already knows . And cries and cries . Then , before Napewagte had tied down the lodge flap for a night alone , the gossips had reached her . Covering her head , Napewagte made known that she closed her cars to their tattling , but two old women , coming directly from a visit with Hinziwin , had persisted in their talk.  |p488  " She says that now all know whom the husband desires painfully , the only wife he dares let go and so win praise , " they cackled . " She says that he honors her . He sends her to a man more powerful than himself . " Napewaste remained covered and so the two old bones finally ran off laughing shrilly , foolishly glad that something had occurred to break the usualness of an old woman 's day . But certain young women , coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp whispering a different story , nothing like the one the two old torments had told . They understood that the Mahto leader had grown too old to please Hinziwin but that Hinziwin , not the sort of woman to put a leader 's things outside her lodge and so embarrass him , had made the man agree to this way of separating . Hinziwin , surprised that so many women walked the sheltered path to her retreat , had tossed her head at the sympathizing looks and sent back her messagesfor the village . But once alone , crouched in the customary position of a retreating-lodge , she leaned on her arms and hunted something comforting . Her throat ached from the tiny sobs she had swallowed . He will not dishonor me , she told herself once again . The people will say that he honors me . I am his desire , not the overripe old sack they call Ina . I remain his desire , even above Napewaste , the mother of his son . For a moment she considered Ahbleza . I will approach this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , she whispered ; I will enjoy lying with a young warrior for a change . Then she remembered ; Olepi gave her to Isna . So why grieve ? She will not lack for ornaments and gowns in the lodge of the Kuya leader . And soon she found a most exciting thought : Isna now wears the Iyuptala sash . And not always will an Iyuptala walk away from the earth whereon he stakes himself ; occasionally he dies where he stands . Which Olepi remembers . Most certainly Olepi schemes to reclaim her . They praise him for his couragein discarding her , but who will hold anything against a man who takes back his gift when he learns that an enemy kills her new owner ? Who will want to see Hinziwin suddenly without a provider ? For a while she experienced a feeling of true regard , almost affection , for Olepi . And so , her heart light again , she quickly slept . The ranking Iyuptala had assigned two , three members to stay the next two nights in the akicita-lodge with Olepi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mahto 's thoughts from the woman he throws away . But neither these watchers nor the watched appreciated the arrangement ; they simply endured the custom . Whatever his companions imagined , two desires sat back of Olepi 's staring eyes this night and neither one concerned reunion with Hinziwin . He wanted the principals of the Pta-lodge to recognize that he had thrown away ap489woman he desired to keep and he wanted Isna to understand the prize he had received . Attentive to these two things , Olepi had tried to close his ears to the ridiculoustalk going on around him , something about finding him a replacement for Hinziwin . Certainly he needed none of these reassurances from babbling Iyuptala ; if he saw a desirable woman  --  Lakotah , Mnikoozu or enemy-captive  --  hewill take her and without anyone 's help . He regretted that custom demanded his staying in this lodge two nights , two nights of harangue from so-called protectors . Napewaste , sitting these same two nights in her tightly closed lodge , seemed nothing more than a robe hunched over an empty fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he kept not a wife but the mother of his son . His heart 's true desire : Hinziwin . But why pretend that this thing surprises her ? From the beginning Olepi saw the pretty girl as an exciting and diverting child-wife , something he had not sought in the woman he originally chose . Then , while Hinziwin ripened into a nice-looking woman , she  --  Napewastefattenedinto something old and slow . Not that she wanted to change places with Hinziwin  --  she will prefer dying to seeing herself a throwaway or living as wife to any different man  --  but why will Olepi carefully hand Hinziwin to a man who this same day accepts the sash ? Everyone knows what happens to most sash-wearers . Men-with-short-lives , the Iyuptala call these warriors and pledge protection of their wives if the husband never returns . A pipe-keeper in the Iyuptala acts as a protector of all Iyuptala wives ; Olepi sits responsible for the safety of these women during the summer camps . And so the Mahto remains , if not the husband , certainly Hinziwin 's protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he keeps me for my good hands at cooking , scraping hides , holding awl and quills . But I will have him want me as on that day when first he bathes me . I will have him smile at me as he smiles at Hinziwin . He says once that he will not enjoy himself if I go out of his sight . Now I am wondering whether he hunts someone to bring in Hinziwin 's place . Truly I will not endure those ten-and-five seasons with Hinziwinbut for the comfort a daughter and my sister lend . Now Kehala raises her own lodge and my sister talks of visiting her son 's family next winter . And so I will sit on my robes listening for the feet of him I call husband . And when he comes perhaps I dare beg for a little tenderness . But if ever he brings to this tipi flap another woman . . . Her imagination had taken hold and , seeing herself neglected and unwanted , she began a foolish crying . She had untied the tipi flap only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had covered her head and walked , unrecognizing and unrecognized , to the women 's ground . Now a third dawn aroused her . The Iyuptala walked through camp at sunrise , the men singing praise for Olepi . The food-passer stands waiting at thep490Iyuptala-lodge , they told , with many bowls . He invites each Mahto warrior to feast with a man who throws-wife-away . Napewagte heard but without new pain or a recurrence of the old . After a while she moved her legs , stiff from her long sitting . She will rise and go , as always , for water and wood . And she will keep on making fires and preparing hides while Hinziwin , moving into a different camp , will keep on playing at these things . She smoothed her unbrushed hair in a disinterested manner , then reached for the water-sac , the container that Hinziwin never had filled but at someone'srequest . Even now the sac , holding dead water , had a stale smell . Suddenly the woman withdrew her hand , her eyes glaring at the sac on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next thing , she had slit the waterskin , the contents dripping onto the ground . Instantly she experienced a most strange satisfaction . She stooped and untied the tipi opening ; she stepped outside . Here for one startled moment she envisioned Olepi in the man who sat with his back to her lodge , the tipi flap closed against his entering . But then she saw that the man who rose , who walked away not once looking in her direction  --  this man not the father but the son . Ahbleza went away knowing that he dared give up his watch . Any danger of another attempt with the neck-cord had passed ; his mother had endured that which had seemed unendurable . Napewagte stood like one upon whom dawn burst before the morning star gave notice . She understood now that the robe she had pulled over her head and the covering she had wrapped around her heart those two days had shut out a wonder . She had neglected to recognize herself not only as the one wife who bore Olepi a child but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generating self . Through the seasons Olepi had given many horses , robes , meat , and now he gave a woman he cherished as a way of showing generosity . But he had created none of these things ; only through Ahbleza had he proved himself a generating force . And then only as an accomplice . And so she vowed to live content with that which Olepi offered , her heart a healing thing , her resolve already firm . She shall go on performing her work , and when finally Olepi sees that young men take his place in the war parties , he will find use for her as a companion . For certainly they had shared many experiences these twenty-and-six winters since the day he had made her a wife . Let the people sing praise for the Mahto and the woman he discards , she told herself ; let everyone cheer and make noise . But the truly wonderful things , the great mysteries , move quietly . Who will hear the sun climb the sky , hear the grasses push up ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound , yet what different thing on all this windy earth gives the Lakotah more protection than these silent keepers of the tribal good.  |p491Remembering  , she shall stay glad for quiet hands and quiet heart and quiet tongue . Stepping back inside the lodge , Napewaste located a big waterskin , one that always had smelled fresh . Next , she changed gowns and then , loosening her hair , she carefully brushed and braided the strands . She touched her cheeks with red . And now she stood presentable , ready to go along the path to wood and water . SUMMER WANED , the warm , fat moons thinning , the pte growing new hair against the threat of cold . And now members of the Tatanka , the Pta-lodge , came together for their once-a-season feast . In Napewaste 's tipi someone watched these headmen file toward the center , where they will hold their ceremony , where they will eat and dance and smoke . And announce any new members . Olepi waited , the resigned wait of a final chance ; if they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they never will take him into the Tatanka-lodge . Ahbleza 's heart reached out to his father on this day . Sitting with Olepi for a smoke , the son had observed an unnatural quiet about the man . When someone came looking for Napewaste , when old Leksi received a caller , Olepi had not so much as glanced up from his pipestem . But now , abruptly and without signal , someone jerked aside the lodge flap and stepped boldly into the tipi , someone whose appearance demanded respect . Slowly the Mahto leader turned his eyes toward this intruder . He saw the headwear that marks a Pta-member , a headpiece made from the hide of an old herd-father , horns attached and painted red . And he saw other things that mark a headman : daubs of white paint on middle-aged shoulders , arms , and breast , and a white lance in the big-belly 's hand . Olepi stood , but nothing will hurry him . For ten-and-one winters the Mahto had waited for this moment and he intended to enact superbly each meaningful gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , the Mahto returning his steady gaze . Next , an arm painted white reached out , touching the unpaintedp492Mahto on the shoulder ; the big-belly snorted in the manner of pta , waiting for Olepi to respond with a similar sound . And then the white-painted one guided Olepi out of the lodge and toward the center-place , where members of the Tatanka sat looking for this leader of the Mahto villages , this important Titonwan . And Ahbleza , seeing these two go , threw his heart to whatever power had granted his father this lifelong wish . Many eyes saw Olepi enter the council lodge ; many hearts rejoiced that the Tatanka had lifted the lodge flap to this man . But in one tipi the news embittereda certain woman , her shapely mouth twisting unpleasantly , her eyes clouding . " He throws me away and so the Tatanka receive him . " Igna answered shrewdly : " If I throw you away , will they make me a Pta-member ? " Instantly Hinziwin regretted her outburst ; already she had learned that they will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this lodge . She dropped gracefully to the ground in front of the man ; she pulled off his moccasins . She began to rub his foot between her palms in the manner a man enjoys . " The Iyuptala , " she murmured , " will make you a pipe-man . Soon after the Kuya leader wears his sash in a fight , they will name him pipe-bearer . " Isna 's scornful lips curled disapproval at her unbecoming entry into his affairs , but Hinziwin , bent over his foot , escaped the look . Nor had she understood that which he now told her . " The Iyuptala set aside certain rules for me . They will not risk my loss . " He spoke curtly , pulling away his foot . " Put back the moccasins . I go to the center , where Olepi feasts with the headmen . I like this Mahto whatever your wish that I see him differently . " Toward evening Hinziwin had gone with a group of women to watch the Tatanka perform their ceremonial dance . Silently she had marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly anyone who closely observes the Mahto will have reason to laugh in her face if ever again she says that he grows too old for a young wife ; even now the most attractive women in camp smile at him . Tonweya had stood alongside Ahbleza during the dance , and now he spoke , not turning his eyes . " You , my brother , will dance with these men one day . " Only if I get fat at my middle . " He had not dared a serious answer , not with the situation unchanged ; the leaders looked through him as before , his voice in council yet unnoticed . " Your father joins the lodge , nothing fat about his belly . Truly , he owns the body of a brave . " The scout 's eyes followed the dancing men , whop493bellowed and snuffled and butted each other after the custom of pta ; only Olepi appeared graceful . " Perhaps they give up on my father . Perhaps they delay his invitation these many winters waiting for him to fatten . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances at those big-bellies when you have something much more exciting within view . " He pointed his thumb at a certain young woman . " And this one , not the only good-looking woman in camp . Among those captive Psa-women , I see . . . " " So take one , " Ahbleza smiled . " What woman wants a scout for husband ? I am rarely in camp and any tipi smothers me . " " Let the woman decide if she wants a scout for husband . " " What woman ? " Tonweya asked lightly but not depreciatingly . " Whatever one you decide . " Suddenly Tonweya 's smile faded . " Something I will ask you , cinye . The people say that a dreaming-pair shall share a woman even as they share a vision . They say that whatever woman you choose I shall regard as a distantwife . But I am not certain that I understand this phrase my soul and your soul cast shadow on each other ' as the meaning of distant-wife . " Ahbleza , also unsmiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  --  brother  --  yet custom will not permit your saying hankasi '  --  sister  --  to a woman I make wife . You dare not joke with my woman nor I with yours . So perhaps you see why the grandfathers decide on this expression of respect , mitawanagi nu nitawanagi sakib aiyohanswicaye , ' but only for use between brother-friends who become a dreaming-pair . " Whether or not Tonweya really understood had seemed unimportant at this moment and so the two had returned their attention to the gifting that followed the dance , many persons presenting horses in Olepi 's name . Presently they led a white horse into the center , the herald announcing that this snow-white one now belongs to Olepi . Each Pta-member , he told , shall own a white horse , not for war but in memory of war , a horse whose white flanks shall carry a picture-record . The Mahto , accepting this symbol of rank , jumped horseback . For a moment he sat tall before the crowd , his dignity and fine-looks commanding the tribe 's respect , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living always the warrior , a man who will know a warrior 's day for dying . He will look on the face of the crowd and see each one granting him that which he knows he earns . And so when Olepi turned his horse to ride slowly toward his lodge , the people also turned toward their lodges ; the Mahto 's movements seemed like the closing ceremony , not only for the Tatanka but for the summer camp . But certain ones , seeing the people break for the winter season , remembered that once again the headmen had put off naming a new Shirt-owner . Will this thing mean , one observer had asked himself , that the Titonwan stopp494growing the sort of man who rises shoulders and head above the crowd , who will hold up the enduring good for everyone 's viewing , who will stand conspicuous as a tree on the plain , his roots in earth 's untrampled truth ? Will this thing mean that the Lakotah never again will raise a Shirtman ? ANOTHER WINTER sat in the past ; again the bird-with-two-voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lakotah encampment . Grass and sky these days seemed the same color , give or take away some light , and all that moved on foot or wing either heard or made a song . So earth will renew her own after a long , cold sleep . Eyanpaha moved more slowly among the lodges than in those seasons when he had teased the boy Mahtocigala about his fat-puppy-of-a-horse , but the old man 's voice , unchanged . This morning he had sung out clear and strong that the Kuya had come , Isna 's band the last ones to arrive . The people had wintered on the muddy-water , the only group to go back to the big river for the snow moons . And now Ahbleza walked with his father to the Kuya 's camp , Olepi wanting to smoke with the returned leader , Ahbleza choosing to visit with his friend Tasunkekokipapi . The son of Olepi had heard that Tasunkekokipapi now headed a village and also sat as pipe-man for the Kangi Yuha , an akicita-lodge which had originated in the Kuya band . He desired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the smile on Ahbleza 's face vanished during the talk with his friend . The Kuya warrior told that Isna 's camp on the muddy-water had stood near the new trading lodge and that the stink and noise around the traders had offended many families . Tasunkekokipapi had decided to leave camp and raise his lodge a half-day 's walk up the sica , the tricky stream long familiar to the Mahto . Five , six lodges of related persons had followed him and had set up their own winter village . During the cold moons these families had spoken their desire that he keep the village , that he become leader . Tasunkekokipapi mentioned only briefly the burning drink for which many Kuya made trades , but Ahbleza had heard enough to understand that not all goes good in the Isna camp this past winter , the yellow-water as always a big troublemaker . In a different tipi Olepi and Isna smoked , the Kuya avoiding any referencep495to the deadwood lodge . Remembering the Mahto 's bitterness toward all white traders , Isna had talked mostly about seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunching center on the ice , bracing for the slide , and getting to the opposite side safely . But he told that he had not seen even one pte all the way from the big river to this camp . Olepi listened but he also sat observing changes in the Kuya : a difference in Isna 's eyes and a sullen quiet among those people who unpacked their drags alongside the Kuya 's lodge . Usually women chattered and laughed as they performed this work , but Igna 's women walked averting their faces . And when the Mahto left the leader 's tipi , he noticed that one woman covered her head at his passing . Recognizing this woman 's walk , he understood that Hinziwinchose to avoid any meeting of the eyes . True , the woman had hidden her face ; she had not wanted the Mahto to see the change . Perhaps an orderly camp this summer , she had told herself , will return her glow , but until this happens she will not go anywhere without a cover over her head . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated whose voice managed the Kuya lodge . Rapping Hinziwin across the legs with a digging-stick , she had put a stop to pouts and complaints . And so Hinziwin , always eager to go somewhere outside the lodge , hunted excitement among the startling new things which the whiteman-trader had brought to his deadwoodshelter on the muddy river . But here her pleasures turned into somethingrevolting . The whiteman , discovering her appeal , had found something to demand in trade if ever Isna came looking for a drink . Isna had come looking for a drink , and soon Hinziwin had heard the Kuya demanding that she visit the trader at dusk . But when the whiteman approached her , she had shuddered at the sight of the lusting eyes and hairy breast . She had torn at the repulsive beard , but her fight had acted to intensifyhis desire , to give him overwhelming strength . When finally he had thrown her back to Isna  --  the Kuya leader lay drunk on the ground outside the trading-place  --  she had clung to the husband 's body until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks back to camp , where Wiyukcan Mani huddled in trembling fear . Hinziwin had not gone near the trader 's lodge again , but Isna went often , trading for the yellow-violence and drinking himself crazy . Perhaps , WiyukcanMath had said , when the moon of making-fat appears and they move off this place , Isna will live good once more . And so the two wives had found a thin comfort in each other 's company while they waited for this darkness to pass , for the snows to melt , for the band to start walking toward that great heart-shaped mound , the black hills . Three , four days after the Mahto 's visit in the Kuya lodge , members of Napcwa4te 's family who sat at the morning soup , heard a scratching on the tipi . But everyone looked for callers these days . Akicita-pledges and their warrior-brothers had begun making the rounds , collecting hides , skins , paint ,  |p496and  feathers in return for the watch they shall keep on the summer encampment . And certainly they scratched most often on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , desiring something to distribute among the aged and blind and among those women who lacked providers . But on hearing these scratches , Olepi neither rose nor reached for the notched stick which signified a horse . Instead he made a sound that welcomedtwo clubmen from the Kangi Yuha , akicita who , on entering , stood arms folded , their faces painted black , their eyes on Ahbleza . The warrior glanced from his father 's face to the clubmen , then back to his father ; a pulsing began in his cheek . For one crushing moment he wondered whether his friend Tasunkekokipapi had perpetrated this scheme , forcing him to demonstrate that never will he join an akicita-lodge . But the next moment he sat puzzling who will trick him , who will send these clubmen here , these two who gesture with their whips ? Bursting anger , Ahbleza jumped to his feet ; he walked between the clubmento the akicita-lodge , but his tight mouth warned of something desperate . Seeing whom the clubmen accompanied , a crowd followed these three to the Kangi Yuha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuouslyempty , a short lance in the near ground . Into this vacancy , the clubmennow tried to push Ahbleza . The son of Olepi saw the short lance , the stick they formally had wrapped with hair , and so he understood what his acceptance demanded of him . He jerked off the clubmen 's hold on his arms ; his eyes blazed scorn at the Kangi Yuha singers who began a song about the honor that comes to anyone who takes hold of this lance . Who will dare this impertinence ? Who will dare challenge his choice to stay outside the brother-lodges ? Who will dare embarrass him , make him appearfearful of the lance ? And then , startlingly as stone that cracks in a fire , he knew who dared : his father . Olepi knows about the scheme yet says nothing to discourage this discomfitingexhibition ? His father hears him say more than once that he will not make ties with any warrior-lodge . Or will his father stand alongside the persuaders ? Olepi makes a gift of Hinziwin to the Kuya , in whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use his son to help along connections with I  --  na 's camp ? Eyes glaring , Ahbleza moved out of the clubmen 's reach . But now other Kangi Yuha stood in his path . The warrior whirled around ; he stared at the seated members , at Tasunkekokipapi , who held onto the quilled pipestem , the man 's face devoid of any show of emotion . At a signal the lodge-singers began a new persuading song . " Danger in front , " they said , " you walk out meeting . " Danger in back , you turn around facing . " They sang as one voice , their tones entreating : " Something difficult you will perform . Uncertain you live . "  |p497Ahbleza  looked anything but uncertain , and so these voices had not held together . Breaking off , their song dropped to the ground . Now came those members obligated to step forward with a mouthful of pleas . And next the herald , a lance-bearer 's song on his tongue-tip . But almostat once they all backed off . Losing patience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries this thing too far . Let the son of Olepi remember that the Kangi Yuha honor him ; to what different warrior will they give this second , third chance ? Again the two clubmen took hold of the warrior ; again they tried to push him into the lance-seat . But Ahbleza seemed not to notice these persons ; insteadhe glared at the lance as if the weapon had made the appeal . And now someone from back of the crowd , aware that Ahbleza intended to shake off the clubmen once more , stepped forward ; he spoke calmly : " My son , I bring the white horse , symbol of my most important rank . The horse belongs to you when I see your hand grasp the lance . " Who empowers this craziness ? Who dares try to coerce him ? Their shuns accustom him to a lonely path ; why try to push him now ? His eyes hostile , his body trembling and ready to leap , he faced Olepi . What manner of father will try to bribe his son ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bribe ? Who says he shall honor any man  --  father , or not father  --  for whom he loses respect ? A strange darkness closed in on Ahbleza ; he struggled to stay on his feet , to hold on to his senses , to answer things that seemed not to have answers . Will he dare say that he loses respect for his father before he knows truly why Olepi offers the white horse , why the man entreats his son to accept the lance ? The Lakotah give a name to that which they not yet understand ; they say mystery . And a Lakotah accepts mystery as mystery until he knows . Ahbleza felt a shudder passing through him , touching his body everywhere . And then the floating darkness lifted ; laughter , his own laughter , brought back the light . And now , before the astounded Kangi Yuha members became incensed at the sound of this laughter , Ahbleza acted ; he reached for the lance . " Men , " he shouted , " I take your lance . I go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I invite each man of the Kangi Yuha to join this war party . Come along and watch . Or come along and fight . " The crowd , amazed at the sight of Ahbleza suddenly holding aloft the weapon , murmured their apprehension . The son of Olepi speaks boldly , but will he remember that all Tokala die on that one occasion when the lodge members go out as a group ? Will Ahbleza ignore that which happens to the Sahiela lodgemen who ride out together ? The picture-record tells the story of what occurs when Hehlogeca and thirty lodge-brothers encounter the Psa . And if Ahbleza will not remember these things , let the Kangi Yuha remember for him and so refuse to take this risk either as fighters or spectators.  |p498But  the Kangi Yuha members already stood , each one cheering Ahbleza , each one signifying his willingness that this lodge go out as a whole , the new lance-bearer their leader . And now , as if in answer to Ahbleza 's challenge , the herald from the centerlodge appeared , the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy . A big party of Psa head this way , he called ; they come in daylight , they come to plead for something , perhaps for their women , captives among the Titonwan since the moon of the TitonwanSahielaattack on their people . At once the Kangi Yuha lodgemen sent up a new yell ; what difference why this enemy comes ? Perhaps the winds carry Ahbleza 's laughter to Psa ears and so Ahbleza will start we course of events . " Paint yourselves . Prepare for whatever shall occur . " They answered Ahbleza 's shout with more loud yells , the crowd joining in with cheers and trilling . And Olepi , looking upon the person of his son , decided that nothing more magnificent than this view of Ahbleza , lance-arm lifted , ever shall confront the Lakotah . Alongside the Kangi Yuha lodge Ahbleza darkened his skin with the black powder and fat which these akicita-warriors wore whenever they fought or danced . And to this place Olepi led the white horse ; let Ahbleza remember the gift that awaits his return . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding your horse against the enemy . I want the people to know that I honor my father 's bribe . But afterwards I will return the horse to your herd . " Ahbleza mixed a second handful of the burntwooddust and fat ; he kept his eyes on the bowl . Olepi appeared not to notice the word bribe , ' but he had not tried to hide his amazement and concern . Why will Ahbleza choose to ride an unfamiliar horse and one of a color that makes the horseback an easy mark ? Why this foolish risk ? " You prove your bravery in accepting the lance , " he said quietly . " I take the lance to show the people that I honor my father 's wish . But this act leaves me without honor for myself . " The Mahto reached out his hand , touching his son 's shoulder . " Why this talk ? They present you a lance and each one pledges that he will ride out with you . Yet you find nothing honorable here ? " Gently Ahbleza withdrew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know my way . I am not one for the akicita-lodges , yet you , my father , scheme this thing . " Olepi 's eyes narrowed . " The people wonder , " he said , " why my son stands off from warrior customs . But now they see that the akicita place you in a most demanding rank ; the Kangi Yuha trust you with the lance . What more honor will you ask ? " " I ask that you and they honor that which I choose . " Ahbleza stood painted and ready to ride , but he waited another momentp499alongside Olepi . " My father , hear me . I observe that the same truth sits back of all you ever say to me : that a man shall reason and choose . And that other persons will respect his choice , whether or not they agree . " From you I hear of the path which each man shall discover for himself . You say that a man shall walk firmly on this path . But now , seeing me act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and a horse . " Ahbleza turned to mount . Olepi answered quickly , sharply . " What path will you take that mine and yours divide ? " Looking into his father 's face , the son spoke the truth he long since had recognized . " Your words and your act tell me that you want not bravery but only a show of bravery . I dare refuse the akicita-lodge  --  something not one other Lakotah yet dares  --  but this thing counts for nothing in your eyes . Yet when I take the lance  --  something any Lakotah will dare  --  you cheer this show of courage . My father , come with me . I will give you that which you ask ; I will give you the most exciting display of bravery you ever shall wit-ness . " Lance in hand , Ahbleza jumped horseback . " Anpetu kin le oyate wamayakapikte lo , " he shouted ; " this day the people see me . " Whirling the white horse , he dashed into the midst of the painted , yelling Kangi Yuha ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter , a one-man show , a show this son puts on for his father . Many persons , responding to the war cries and trilling , accompanied the warriors who now moved across the camp circle , thirty Kangi Yuha in the party , their whoops more like sixty . Ahbleza , keeping far front , had found reason to marvel : the white horse responded to his touch unlike any horse he ever rode ; not even Tatezi reacted this quickly . And so he recalled that occasionally a man will exert tremendous power over his mount . Such a man , in a running fight , will use up his horse and ever after they call his horse crazy . ' Perhaps my father shall own a crazy horse after this ride , he told himself , for I shall empty this one of everything . Before the Kangi Yuha had caught up with him , Ahbleza saw someone coming up fast ; the next instant he recognized Tonweya . " I go out . I face the Psa . Tell me anything you know , " Ahbleza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse will not sweat before you meet the enemy ; thirty-and-six come back of me , swift horses between their legs . They come , foreheads bare of paint . They carry bows but not lances . " Whatever surprise Tonweya experienced on encountering the son of Olepi in this strange situation  --  Ahbleza racing front of a war party and carrying a Kangi Yuha lance  --  the scout properly concealed . " Tell the camp . " Ahbleza gave a startling yell . " The power rides with me . I will show the people something . "  |p500The  akicita-lodgemen came close behind the lance-bearer now , and , hearing his yell , they followed him down the slope , into the bowl-like valley . Tonweya hurried toward the encampment , but the bands had not waited for more news . The people had come rushing out , scrambling to the top of the slope for a good view . And now they stood covering the rise , men and women and children looking out over the wide valley , seeing the enemy 's dust . Apparently more than thirty Psa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise approach from the opposite side of the trees . Excitement shook the spectators . One Titonwan warrior suddenly saw the location as a good place for rivalrybetween warrior-lodges ; Pala had begun to incite the men of the Ihoka-lodge , shouting that they also belonged in this fight . " Let the whole tribe act as witness ; let each person see for himself who dares touch the enemy , " he cried . " Let the people discover in which warriorlodgethe bravery sits . " Certain Ihoka had disagreed with Pesla . The head clubmen for this summer'sencampment , they told , sit watching for anyone who closes his ears to caution , who intends to dash down the hill . This fight belongs to Ahbleza and to the lodge whose lance he carries ; the elected watchers give orders that none interfere . Ahbleza had halted his party on the near side of the woods ; he had seen his chance to give the people , along with his father , the spectacular about which he had boasted . And so he intended to hold the Kangi Yuha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Psa  --  now alerted for a fight  --  coming either through the woods or around . A smile tickled inside Ahbleza 's cheek . A show they want , a show he will give . And he shall make up for whatever he lacked on that occasion when an old Psa-man had ripped open his side . This day he will make the rips and from whatever spot he stakes himself . He saw the warriors shift uneasily on their horses . He spoke calmly : " Show patience , my friends . This enemy chooses a day-visit and so they see those Lakotah on the ridge , but they will not look for a war party waiting here . " Suddenly Ahbleza raised his lance-arm as when he had accepted the lance . " I smell the stink of Psa hair . The beggar comes out of the woods . Look at him . Takpe . " The son of Olepi gave the blood-chilling whoop that usually froze an enemy , putting a man in line for arrow or club . But the Psa came riding straight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars . And so the contest began , horsebacks riding in every direction , men shrieking insults , reaching out to strike with bow or palm . Ahbleza , carrying only the lance , tried to maneuver into an open place where he dared jump down and make a stand . But always one of his own men rushed in front of him , a lodgeman in his path and interfering with hisp501chances at every turn . True , these Kangi Yuha rode pledged to help him but not until he had thrust the lance into the ground and stood alongside . And now he made his bold cries at his own . " Get out of my way , " he shouted . But none seemed to listen . Then suddenly one who had ridden interferencefell limp , dropping off his horse ; an arrow intended for Ahbleza had pierced a different man 's breast . Instantly Ahbleza whipped around to pick up the hurt or dying Kangi Yuha , but another lodgeman already lifted the struck body onto his horse . What happens here ? Will they deny me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the most dangerous position in the fight . At once three Kangi Yuha rode in protectingly . The Psa had begun to scatter , running back toward the woods . Aware of the many Lakotah who moved around on the ridge , they perhaps looked for many more warriors to rush out from this yelling throng . And so , reaching the trees , two Psa now rode back and forth , a sign of retreat . Whoops of victory rose from the slope and certain Titonwan came riding down onto the flat , all relatives of the fallen warrior , persons anxious to know whether the man lay wounded or killed . Ahbleza stayed back on the fighting ground ; horseback , he sat unmoving , the lance across his thighs . They never once had granted him an opening , a place to make his stand . And the look on faces riding past him confused him even more . Will they regard him as some mystery who suddenly appears but will not fit into the Lakotah scheme ? Or will he imagine all this strangeness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , or will he stand out as some weird sort of prize ? Perhaps this day , this experience , ties in with the strange way the headmen react to him these many seasons , this whole thing enough to overwhelm a man . Then he saw that Pegla , who had ridden forward to meet the fighting men , turned from these warriors to speak to him . The harsh face wore a curious smile . " I see , " he said , " that you , the daring leader of this party , returns safe , yet a certain brave man , one of your protectors , lies choking on his own blood . " Abruptly as he had approached , Pesla rode off . So the Kangi Yuha also use him for something . But for what ? Will they deprive him of joy in combat or prevent any honors ? Certainly they will not see a man receiving wounds , perhaps dying , in their attempt to humble a different man ? Reluctantly Ahbleza started toward the crowd that surrounded the injured Titonwan . The fleeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued . They had viewed this encounter as something similar to an exciting ball game , some persons even making bets . The pezuta had signaled that the hurt warrior recovers , and so , when the Psa had begun to run off , the Lakotahspectators whooped victory ; the enemy had accepted defeat . But one little group of women  --  Psa captives not yet adopted into the hands  --  had kept their eyes on the distant woods ; they had wondered whether a husband , son , or brother rode among those retreating horsebacks.  |p502And  now one in this huddle , speaking her own dialect , made known her musing . " Why will they run off ? " she said ; " they count the most men and none gets hurt . Perhaps this fight goes on again . They remember that Psawomenwatch , and so they also desire putting on a good show . " Her listeners looked uncertain . Turning away , they started back to their lodges . And then the woman who had spoken called softly , " Look . They come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahbleza had not yet reached the group who surrounded the reviving brother-member , but he saw that these Kangi Yuha suddenly looked up , their smiles disappearing . Next thing , he heard the whoops of an enemy who returns . And now Pesla dared take command of a party , Ihoka and Kangi Yuha warriors mounting , racing out on the flat , bows and lances along on this ride . But riding far front , Ahbleza . And who will stop him now ? The wind slapped the warrior 's face , but he had the breath to encourage his horse . " The fight belongs to me and to you , friend , " he shouted . " Use your nose . Avoid the holes . I will not want the people seeing me fall . " The wingbone whistle tied in Ahbleza 's hair hummed in his ear . " I hear you , " he said , " now you hear me . " Raising the lance he began a song . The Psa , riding a zigzag line , approached noisily , shouting defiance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new advance . Not again will they who come peacefully , retreat ; they return as warriors ready to die . And so the Psa regretted seeing only one horseback ride out , one man on a white horse . But truly this one man came directly , swiftly , so swiftly that he seemed to fly . Perhaps a violator of sacred custom rode out , making this death-ride in self-reproach . For certainly this man shall die . " Hanta yo , " Ahbleza sang ; " wakanya hibu welo "  --  " Clear the way ; in a wonderful manner I come . " His song and his ride , the same : fast , fast , increasinglyfast . " Hanta yo , wakanya hibu welo . " The horse reacted to the rider 's voice , the creature 's withers and loin , flank and belly rippling to the beat . " Maka kin le mitawa "  --  " I own the earth . " The horse burst into new life , and Ahbleza knew the power of this horse as his to claim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I own the earth and so I come . " The wind tore at the man 's hair , flinging the black , loose strands over his shoulders ; the wind lifted the horse 's mane , making streamers of the long white hairs . The man sensed a loan of power , from stone on and under the ground , from the wind in four directions . " I own the earth , " he sang and knew that he spoke the truth . " Hanta yo , hanta yo . " " Clear the way , clear the way . " The Psa , ceasing their yells , wondered now whether they faced the mostp503powerful of contraries , a man who dreams not of the zigzag streak between clouds but of a bolt straight down and up , sky to earth to sky . But once this mystery-dreamer comes inside reach of a Psa bow , he shall lose his voice for song , for his song of defiance . For what different song will this crazy rider sing but his final demand for power ? " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor made his death-ride ; instead he came remembering himself as a sacred arrow aimed at the heart of things . " Hanta yo . Hanta yo . " " Clear the way . Clear the way . " And now to the man the Psa slowed their horses ; something magnificent held this enemy to a walk . Power , mystery , something to marvel rode here , perhaps a wambli-bird on the back of a pronghorn , something they dared not treat as man . They sat unmoving . Perhaps this rider owned an unknowable power ; certainlyhe never looked back to see whether more of his tribe followed him . He simply came . Alone . Two , three Psa warriors set an arrow to the bowstring , but they seemed to lack the strength to push the bow . They heard his song more clearly now and certain phrases they understood . And so a shiver of uneasiness passed through these warriors who sat waiting . But waiting for what thing , they will not know . " Hanta yo ; wakanya hibu welo "  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maka kin le mitawa , ca hibu weld '  --  " I own the earth and so I come . " The song had emptied Ahbleza of old power ; now silently , quickly he filled with the new , his person reborn , the beginning revisited in an instant , in a flash of truth . Ahbleza , as First Born , unrestrained and breathing joy ; original man , looking at his hands , picking up stone , breaking off wood , making something to protect himself . Ahbleza , as Second Born , as young brother to First Born , naked and in conflict with hoof and wing , young brother who shall assert the supremacy of man over creature . Ahbleza , as man-traveling , as man who discovers Iktomi , a trickster , whereverhe goes ; as man always in conflict with Iktomi , a mischief-maker . Ahbleza , as Lakotah , the family ; as Titonwan , living on the plain ; as Mahto , the grizzly band . Ahbleza , as Ahbleza the observer , as the power for owning the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized this man and horse , something an invisible power generates , all the grandfathers back to the beginning making this ride , a spirit-force the Psa dare not contest . And so , before this onrushing power  --  in the shape of a horseback  --  crushed the whole party , one Psa warrior managed a yell of alarm . His cry scattered the men , sending each one on a frenzied run hack toward the woods.
