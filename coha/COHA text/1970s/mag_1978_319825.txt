TRIBUTE by Bernard Slade <P> Considering the alternative , dying has a lot to recommend it . In recent years screenwriters and playwrights have even found it an unexpected source of dark and cathartic humor . Bernard Slade , the author of the long-running comedy Same Time , Next Year , is the first , however , to write about it as if he were composing humorous jingles for Hallmark cards : " Out but not down . " <P> His hero , Scottie Templeton ( Jack Lemmon ) , is a charming , but irresponsible public relations man with a bad case of leukemia . Scottie 's one gift has been his ability to make people happy , and in his last days he tries to reconcile with the one person he has made miserable , his son , Jud ( Robert Picardo ) , whom he abandoned in the divorce settlement . He amuses Jud with jokes and funny costumes , finds him a girl ( Catherine Hicks ) , and smothers him with affection . But Jud , a 20-year-old fogy , refuses to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonja Henie she was a great actress , " he remarks in one of the play 's best lines . <P> So it goes , and eventually both Scottie and the audience wonder why he keeps trying so hard to gain back this obnoxious kid 's affection . But win he does , and midway through the second act Jud is organizing a tribute to the old man in a Broadway theater . Unfortunately , the play falls apart about the same time , and when Scottie 's turn comes to take the stage , he can only say : " You see be fore you a man who has absolutely no finish . I 'm not kidding . I do n't know how to get off . " Playwright Slade might better have spoken the lines himself . His play does not end , but slides to a bathetic conclusion in unsightly puddles of tears and sweat . <P> The other actors supply the tears , but most of the sweat comes from Lemmon , who gives his best performance in years . It is comparatively simple to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , that most elusive of all qualities , is much harder . Dropping all the irritating mannerisms that have marred his recent movies , Lemmon makes the task seem like ease itself . He is a better actor than he usually allows himself to be , and if it does nothing else , Tribute has restored him to the profession . <P> <P> - Gerald Clarke
