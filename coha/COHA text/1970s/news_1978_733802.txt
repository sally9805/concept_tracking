txt With the ink only just dry on the Aug. 12 China-Japan peace treaty , Japanese businessmen and officials are losing little time in stepping up the already considerable economic cooperation between the two countries . Several official and private Japanese delegations are embarking on trips to China to negotiate the sale of steel plants , petrochemical complexes , offshore oil exploration , and , more important , the mechanics of financing such large purchases by Peking . The stakes are high . China 's complete plant purchases in the next decade are expected to reach about $30 billion . The competition for such massive technology and plant transfer is fierce between Tokyo , Bonn , and London , with the Japanese clearly on the inside track . In spite of a recent highly publicized sale of computers and other sophisticated electronic equipment , United States banks and businessmen are on the sidelines of this trade bonanza because of the lack of full diplomatic ties with Peking and the freezing of mutual assets since the Chinese Communists came to power in 1949 . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years and crude oil imports from China to increase six times in the coming 12 years . A report by the Tokyo-based Yamaichi Research Institute predicts the annual turnover of Sino-Japanese trade will rise to $7.35 billion in 1981 , compared with the 1977 total of $3.49 billion . The turnover for the current year , based on the first six months ' record , is expected to be $5.6 billion . // From page 1 Japan sets out to build China trade Earlier this year Japan and China entered a private eight-year agreement ( 1978-85 ) worth $20 billion under which China will export oil and coal to Japan in return for industrial plants and technology . To pursue these long-term deals , Japan 's International Trade and Industry Minister , Toshio Komoto , plans to go to Peking in September . He also is slated to discuss the proposed joint exploration of offshore oil in the Po Hai Gulf , about 200 miles from Peking . The groundwork for the joint venture was laid in July between Peking and the semiofficial Japan Petroleum Corporation . ? Cooperation sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cooperate in his grand design to increase Japan 's yearly imports of Chinese crude to 50 million tons in 1990 , about one-eighth of its estimated total oil imports in that year . ? Japan will be importing 7 million tons of Chinese crude this year . Japanese power companies are not too keen on Chinese crude because its heavy wax content requires extra outlays on refining equipment . As China 's capability to pay for plant purchases is largely dependable on the export of oil , Japan may yet be able to persuade electric companies to go along . However , Chinese demands for machinery exceed their capacity to pay by exports ? oil and other traditional items ? and their hard currency reserves . Therefore , foreign governmental bodies and private banks will have a role in financing such trade . In principle , Peking does not accept foreign loans . So far its purchases have been under suppliers ' credits , which are expensive , withthe foreign commercial supplier bearing the risk . Bank deposits accepted ? But in recent months the Bank of China has indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could pay for the purchases from the countries concerned . Britain 's Standard and Chartered Banks and Lloyds Bank have been negotiating to deposit $100 million each with the Bank of China . West German banks are also in the process of making large deposits . Japanese banks already hold some deposits with the Bank of China and Mr. Komoto is expected to offer more . A delegation of Japan 's Export-Import Bank now is in China to sort out the possibility of low-interest government-backed loans ? or deposits ? to the Bank of China .. As the scale of deposits is high , Japanese commercial banks are even talking of syndicated deposits . With their high credit rating among banking circles . the Chinese are known to be bargaining for favorable rates of interest . While the bankers talk money , more . Japanese businessmen and their political allies are also going to China to persuade the authorities to come to a quick settlement . The Japanese Association for the Promotion of International Trade , which is in the vanguard of China trade , is sending its chariman . Aichiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . Soka Gakkai , the 10-million member religious group , whose political arm , the Komeito Party . has close ties with the Chinese , is also sending its Chief . Daisaku Ikeda , to Peking next month to lobby for business . And more visits are likely to beat the expected West European onslaught for similar deals with China .
