txt Letters Letters Nixon Interviews : Reactions to Session One To the Editor : Richard Nixon 's performance Wednesday evening reminds me that Checkers is alive and well and living in San Clemente . After three years I had hoped his unedifying legacy would lie buried and forgotten in the luxurious San Clemente mausoleum . I would n't begrudge the man a quiet retirement even though he has persisted in admitting no guilt in the Watergate matter . But he wo n't submit to a decent burial . He resurrects himself as publicly as possible . Free of legal consequences , he exposes the stinking corpse for profit-seeking vultures to pick over . The most voracious of them all is the self-cannibalizing Mr. Nixon himself . RUTH CRAIG Pelham , N.Y. , May 5 , 1977 ? To the Editor : Nearly three years ago , Richard M. Nixon resigned from the office of President while still insisting that he was not guilty of involvement in the Watergate cover-up . Tonight he was still not able to face the truth , try as David Frost might to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not lying to us , but rather that he was telling us a truth which he had contrived so that he could hang on to the last shred of self-respect he has . And , after watching him for half an hour , I am perfectly happy to let him do so . It is cruel to ask a human being to let down his/her face in front of the world , especially in a world which is increasingly threatened with pollution , overpopulation , starvation and a technology so advanced that it could wipe us out tomorrow if someone were to push the wrong button . Why , then , did not David Frost tonight demand that the people who have in their hands the power to do something about these problems answer to their failure to do so , answer to the fact that they are acting so as to make these threats increasingly worse ? Perhaps it is because we feel a need to absolve ourselves of any responsibility for the world and to pass the buck on to a man who can do us no ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of his least harmful feats ) . It is time for us to put the past in its proper perspective and deal with the present . Donis B. Beerone New York , May 4 , 1977 ? To the Editor : If Nixon hoped to gain anything besides money from the David Frost interview on Watergate , it probably was pity . Well , he has mine . I feel compelled to pity any man who is so lacking in personal pride that he will go voluntarily on television , retell the same old lies ( but this time with a tough interviewer who can answer them ) and so re-expose himself to the contempt and scorn of the country , just for the sake of money . Nixon said he would never grovel . What he did last night was far more demeaning ? to himself and to the nation . Nixon has reached a new low . Not content with disgracing the Presidency On Extending City Rent Curbs To the Editor : The same casual political cynicism that has helped bring our city and our state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss in recent years of hundreds of thousands of jobs and the abandonment of hundreds of thousands of structurally sound housing units , has now effected the extension for four more years of current rent control and rent stabilization regulations . Flying in the face of every study , every report. , every analysis made by s.ny reputable group ( the Commission , the Sternlieb Commission , the Rand Institute , the Company , etc. ) the Legislature has continued to play its dangerous and destructive housing game . With abandonment of 30,000 to 40 , - 000 units per year for the past several years ; with new housing starts in the city at 3,800 for 1975 , 5,800 for 1976 and about the same projected for 1977 ; with the conversion of rental units to co-op at a total standstill ; with roughly 70 percent of our Mitchell-Lama developments in default on real estate taxes and/or mortgage debt service , and with the financial community united in its belief that mortgage investment in New York housing is a " no-win game , " some degree of statesmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Government will at sonic point realize that housing policy is the political " litmus paper " that reveals the level of responsibility of our local political leaders , and that appropriate pressures be brought to bear the next time New York officials are forced to go hat in hand to Washington for aid . DANIEL ROSE Chairman , Housing Committee Real Estate Board of N.Y . New York , April 27 , 1977 while in office , he continues to besmirch it in his shameful enforced retirement . Seemingly , there is no limit to his gall , but there ought to be an end to our endurance . Is n't it we said to him , as Cromwell said to the Rump Parliament , - In the name of God , go " ? CHARLES W. V. MEARES New York , May 5 , 1977 To the Editor : I am sure that most Americans would be embarrassed to see Mr. Nixon getting down and groveling on the floor . No ! Never ! Instead , Mr. Nixon could soothe his troubled Quaker heart by donating the entire proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduction possibilities , too . He would n't have to give a penny of the proceeds to the Government . CHARLES E. MARTIN New York , May 5 , 1977 ? To the Editor : Mr. Nixon 's television appearances usher in a historical process that should lend perspective to Watergate and culminate in a many-sided evaluation of his Administration . Meanwhile the miasma of a nearpathological Nixon-hatred is still with us . Nicholas von Hoffman ( no Nixon fan ) describes it thus in " Penthouse " for March : " Since the dawn of the mass-media age , no other American President has gotten the treatment . Nixon did . . . . The media has reviled and degraded Nixon with everything from accusations of cheating on his income tax , to sexual impotence , to broad hints that he 's gay . " Such malevolence is the real Watergate scandal . Hardly less nauseating than this witch hunt is the pretense that it was all a Galahad-like quest for purity and truth . Here are bottomless depths of hypocrisy inhabited by creatures compared with whom Pecksniff , Tartuffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times of April 25 , William Safire , citing Victor Lasky 's blockbuster of a book , " It Did n't Start With Watergate , " observes that " the crimes , lies , and abuses of power " antedating To the Editor : In his April 26 column " Rebates or Revenue ? " Tom Wicker appears to assume that the rebate of an excise tax cancels the consumer 's incentive to economize on the taxed commodity regardless Of whether the amount of the rebate is or is not related to the amount of consumption of the taxed commodity . This view is incorrect . When an excise tax is imposed ( or increased ) on purchases of a commodity , the rise in the price of the taxed commodity to consumers has two effects that are analytically distinct . First , the purchasing power of the consumer 's total money income is reduced by the fact that he can buy less of his total accustomed market basket of goods and services . This effect , which economists call the " income effect , " tends to reduce the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small if the taxed commodity does not account for a large part of his expenditure , The second and more important effect conies from the rise in the price of the taxed commodity relative to the prices of other things the consumer buys . This relative-price effect , which economists call the " substitution effect , " tends to induce the consumer to shift some of his consumption from the taxed commodity to other commodities or to increase his saving . This effect is generally by far the larger of the two effects . If the amount of the rebate to conthe Nixon era by several years " beat anything that happened before or since . " And what were the paladins of the investigative press doing while these abominations were going on ? You guessed it . They were covering up for their pet politicos . In any calculus of moral values , tt will not do to deny Mr. Nixon every form of " tu-quoque " easement while winking at the vicious double standard of his enemies . What justice is there in selective punishment ? What high morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated victim for destruction ? The final grotesquery is that we do not know to this day whether Mr. Nixon was ( 1 ) guilty of anything more than running into some legalistic mumbo-jumbo and ( 2 ) the target of a conspiratorial cabal . Perhaps the historical process now in motion will answer these questions , just as the Dreyfus case was cleared up in France . T. DumoNr New York , May 4 , 1977 ? To the Editor : I read all about the " Watergate Affair " and I listened to Mr. Nixon yesterday on television . And after all the research  --  I still do n't know why there was a break-in , what they were looking for in the Democratic headquarters and what happened to the 18-minute gap on the tape . There is still a cover-up . How long will it continue ? FELICE HERZL Bronx , May 5 , 1977 ? To the Editor : Listening to the first David Frost Nixon interview , it seems to many of us that a far sadder thing for this nation is played out now by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Watergate . The exPresident had over two and one-half years to reflect and consider all aspects of his behavior during that period , and now , when he had perhaps a final opportunity to do an immeasurably valuable service for the country , he has chosen instead to whine , to obfuscate , to attempt in self-serving argument to blur unassailable records of fact . What an Immense opportunity for this man to have risen above himself , to have acknowledged how any of us can deliberately do great wrong , to have given us all , and our children , a historical lesson in humility and to facing up to our human flaws , whatever our position in life . CuNrote L. Toms Suffern , N.Y. , May 4 , 1977 ? To the Editor : After an hour and one half of listening to the David Frost interview of former President Nixon , I believe Nixon himself summed the entire Watergate matter up in a nutshell when , at the very end of the interview , he admitted he did not handle the affair very well . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have burned the ( expletive deleted ) tapes . HERBERT LEVINE Flushing , N.Y. , May 4 , 1977 sumers Is not related to the quantity of the commodity that they , individually , buy , the rebate may offset the income effect , but it does not offset the rise in the relative price of the commodity , so the substitution effect remains . An individual consumer whose pre-tax purchasing power is restored by the rebate still has an incentive to economize on the taxed commodity . So far as I know , the Administration has not proposed tying the amount of the rebate to the amount of individual consumers ' gasoline consumption . The only proposed link is between the aggregate tax revenue and the aggregate rebate . Such a rebate would not reduce the incentive of the consumer to economize on gasoline except to the minor extent that it restored the purchasing power of his total money income and enabled him to maintain his total consumption . The economic purpose of a rebate unrelated to the amount of the recipient 's post-tax consumption is to offset the income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual consumer with the same total purchasing power while giving him an incentive to economize on gasoline . This incentive would remain , even if the rebate to an individual consumer exceeds the excise tax he pays , so long as its amount is unrelated to his gasoline consumption , WALTER S. SALANT Senior Fellow Emeritus The Brookings Institution Washington , May 2 , 1977 Gasoline , Taxes and Rebates
