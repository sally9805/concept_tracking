" Irrational and indefensible and inexcusable and inexplicable . " That was Ted Kennedy 's own assessment of his behavior ten years ago at Chappaquiddick Island after the automobile accident in which Mary Jo Kopechne died . <P> Ever since , he has been burdened by the events of that night . It was the chief issue that kept Kennedy out of the 1972 presidential race and that caused him to abandon plans to run in 1976 . Now Chappaquiddick is again an issue , and one that is already being used against him . Twice Jimmy Carter has alluded to it . Republican John Connally has been blunter . " I never drowned anybody , " Connally retorted when asked by a reporter about scandals in his own past . <P> Events on that night of July 18-19 , 1969 , began with a cookout at a rented cottage on the island , which lies just across the channel from Edgartown on Martha 's Vineyard . <P> The partygoers were Kennedy , five other men and six women . The women were all in their 20s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours over drinks , snacks and charcoal-broiled steaks , Kennedy and Kopechne , 28 , left in his black Oldsmobile sedan . He claimed later that they intended to return to their separate hotels in Edgartown for the night . However , he headed in the opposite direction , toward a deserted beach . He drove down a bumpy dirt road and plunged off narrow , humpbacked Dike Bridge into Poucha Pond . Kennedy managed to extricate himself from the car , which lay upside down in about six feet of water ; Kopechne did not . <P> The Senator said that he dived several times in an attempt to rescue her but the current was too strong . Giving up , he walked more than a mile back to the cottage and told two old friends , Joseph Gargan and Paul Markham , about the accident . All three drove back to the bridge in another car . Gargan and Markham dived unsuccessfully after Kopechne and then drove Kennedy to the harbor . <P> Because the ferry to Edgartown had been shut down at midnight , the Senator swam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He changed into dry clothes and spoke briefly to the innkeeper . Gargan and Markham , meanwhile , returned to the cottage for the night . Following Kennedy 's instructions , they told no one about the accident . <P> Next morning , Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at the inn . They returned to Chappaquiddick at about 9 a.m. and entered a shack near the ferry slip , where Kennedy tried in vain to phone a family friend , Attorney Burke Marshall . At that point , Ferryman Richard Hewitt asked if they knew about the wrecked car , which had been discovered by some fishermen . Hewitt later testified that Markham replied , " Yes . We just heard about it . " Only then did Kennedy go to the police station and report the accident .
