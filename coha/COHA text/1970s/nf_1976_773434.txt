txt more terrible even than his father Nabopolassar , succeeded him ( 144 A.U.C. , 610 B.C. ) . Born and bred in pride and always occupied with war , this prince made prodigious conquests in the east and the west ( 147 A.U.C. , 607 B.C. ) , and Babylon was threatening to enslave the world . This threat soon affected God 's people . Jerusalem fell prey to the haughty conqueror , who took it three times : the first time at the beginning of his reign , and in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim , whence we date the beginning of the seventy years of the Babylonian Captivity , foretold by the prophet Jeremiah ; the second time ( 155 A.U.C. , 599 B.C. ) under Jeconiah or Jehoiachin , the son of Jehoiakim ; and the last time ( 156 A.U.C. , 598 B.C. ) under Zedekiah , when the city was completely devastated , the Temple burnt to the ground , and the king taken as a captive to Babylon , together with the high priest Seraiah and the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captives were the prophets Ezekiel and Daniel . We also count among them the three young men whom Nebuchadrezzar could not force to adore his statue and who were unharmed by a consuming fire . Greece was flourishing ( 160 A.U.C. , 594 B.C. ) , and its Seven Sages were making their mark . Some time before the last devastation of Jerusalem , Solon , one of these Seven Sages , gave laws to the Athenians , founding liberty upon justice . Also , the Phocaeans of Ionia brought their first colony to Marseilles . Tarquin the Elder , king of Rome , having subjugated a part of Tuscany and embellished the city of Rome with magnificent works , ended his reign ( 176 A.U.C. , 578 B.C. ) . In his time the Gauls , led by Bellovesus , occupied in Italy all the regions adjacent to the Po ( 188 A.U.C. , 566 B.C. ) , while his brother Segovesus led another swarm of the nation deep into Germany . Servius Tullius , successor to Tarquin , established the census or counting of citizens according to their distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered like an individual family . Nebuchadrezzar embellished Babylon , which had become rich from the spoils of Jerusalem and the East . It was not to enjoy them for long . On his deathbed ( 192 A.U.C. , 562 B.C. ) this king , who had decorated it with such magnificence , saw the coming ruin of his superb city . His son Evil-Merodach ( ( Amil-Marduk , who had made himself hateful by his debauchery , was king for a short time only and was killed by his brother-in-law , Nergal-sharuzur , who then usurped the kingdom ( 194 A.U.C. , 560 B.c . ) . In Athens , Peisistratus also usurped the sovereign authority ; he was able to preserve it for thirty years in the face of many vicissitudes and even to pass it on to his children . Nergal-sharuzur could not tolerate the power of the Medes , who were becoming stronger in the East , and declared war against them . While Astyages , son of Cyaxares I , was preparing for resistance , he died , leaving the conduct of the war to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom Daniel calls Darius the Mede . As general of his army , he named Cyrus , the son of his sister Mandane and of ambyses , king of Persia , whose country was subject to the Median mpire . The reputation of Cyrus , who had distinguished himself in rious wars under his grandfather Astyages , united most of the ings of the East under the banners of Cyaxares . He captured roesus , the king of Lydia , in his capital city ( 206 A.U.C. , 548 B.C. ) nd enjoyed his immense wealth . Then he also subdued the other ( lies of the kings of Babylon ( 211 A.U.C. , 543 B.C. ) and extended his le not only over Syria but also deep into Asia Minor . Finally , he arched on Babylon , took the city ( 216 A.U.C. , 538 B.c. ) , and anded it over to his uncle , Cyaxares . Touched as much by his laity as by his exploits , the latter gave him in marriage his only aughter and heiress . Under the reign of Cyaxares , Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a number of celestial visions in hich so many kings and empires passed before him in such anifest form , was given another revelation ( 217 A.U.C. , 537 B.C. ) , - ? ncerning the famous seven weeks by which the times of Christ and c destiny of the Jewish people are explained . They were weeks of ars , so that they contained 490 years ; and such a manner of ? unting was familiar to the Jews , who rested in the seventh year as ell as on the seventh day . Some time after this vision , Cyaxares died ( 218 A.U.C. , 536 B.c. ) , did Cambyses , Cyrus ' father . In succeeding them , this great man , yrus , joined the hitherto obscure kingdom of Persia to the kingdom the Medes , which he had considerably increased by his conquests . Thus he became the uncontested master of the East and founded the greatest empire the world had ever seen . But the most important fact for the sequence of our epochs is the decree this great conqueror handed down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration of God 's Temple in Jerusalem and of the Jewish people in Judaea . We must pause for a moment at this point , which is the most involved of all ancient chronology because of the difficulty in reconciling secular and sacred history . No doubt you will already have noticed , Monseigneur , that what I tell you about Cyrus is quite different from what you have read about him in Justin , for Justin does not mention the second kingdom of the Assyrians at all , any more than the famous kings of Assyria and Babylon who are so renowned in sacred history ; moreover , my account hardly tallies with what that author tells us about the first three monarchies : that of the Assyrians , ending with the person of Sardanapalus ; that of the Medes , ending with the person of Astyages , the grandfather of Cyrus ; and that of the Persians , beginning with Cyrus and destroyed by Alexander . To Justin , you might add Diodorus and most of the Greek and Latin authors whose writings have come down to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the one I have chosen as being more consistent with the Scriptures . But those who are surprised that in some instances secular history is rather inconsistent with sacred history should also note that it is even less consistent with itself . The Greeks have written about the actions of Cyrus in several different ways . Herodotus mentions three ways in addition to the one he followed himself ; and he does not say that the latter is based on older or more trustworthy sources than the others . He also remarks that the death of Cyrus is told in different ways and that he has chosen the one that seemed the most probable to him , without giving it any further authority . Xenophon , who was in Persia in the service of the younger Cyrus , the brother of Artaxerxes ( also called Mnemon ) , was in a position to learn at closer range about the life and death of the older Cyrus from the annals of Persia and the traditions of that country . Anybody who has any knowledge of ancient history will not hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skillful captain Xenophon to Ctesias , * the author of legends ? whom most of the Greeks have copied , just as Justin and the Latins have copied the Greeks ? and even to Herodotus , however judicious he may be . What determines me in my choice is the fact that Xenophon 's history , more coherent and more probable in itself , has the added advantage of being more consistent with the Scriptures , which , because of their antiquity and the relations of the affairs of the Jewish people with others in the East , would merit being preferred to all Greek histories , even if we did not know that they were dictated by the Holy Spirit . As for the first three monarchies , what most of the Greeks have written about them has seemed doubtful to the wisest men of Greece . Plato shows in general , using the case of the Egyptian priests , that the Greeks were completely ignorant of ancient history , and Aristotle classifies those who have written Assyrian history among the legend-tellers . The reason is that the Greeks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious Greeks with ancient stories , they based them on confused memories which they simply put into an agreeable order without giving too much consideration to truthfulness . And certainly , the way in which the first three monarchies are usually arranged is obviously legendary . For having made the empire of the Assyrians perish under Sardanapalus , these writers bring the Medes onto the stage and then the Persians , as if the Medes had succeeded to all the power of the Assyrians and as if the Persians had established themselves by ruining the Medes . But , on the contrary , it seems certain that when Arbaces stirred up the Medes against Sardanapalus , he did no more than to liberate them ; he did not make them masters over the Assyrian Empire . Herodotus distinguishes the age of their liberation from that of their first king , Deioces ; and , according to the most skillful chronologists , the interval between these two ages must have been about fifty years . Furthermore , it is known from the unanimous testimony of that great historian and of Xenophon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time attributed to the empire of the Medes , Assyria had some very powerful and widely feared kings , whose empire was destroyed when Cyrus took Babylon . If , then , most of the Greeks , and the Latins who follow them , do not mention these Babylonian kings ; if they give no consideration to this great kingdom when they talk about the sequence of the first monarchies ; if , finally , their works show us almost nothing of those famous kings , Tiglath-Pileser , Shalmaneser , Sennacherib , Nebuchadrezzar , and so many others who are renowned in the Scriptures and in eastern histories , the fact must be attributed either to the ignorance of the Greeks , who are more eloquent in their narrations than painstaking in their research , or to our loss of the most documented and exact parts of their histories . And in fact Herodotus had promised a special history of the Assyrians , which we do not have , either because it was lost or because he did not have time to write it . But we may believe that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second Assyrian Empire , since even Sennacherib , who was one of them , is mentioned as king of the Assyrians and Arabs in books by that great author which we do have . Strabo , living at the time of Augustus , reports what Megasthenes , an ancient author and near contemporary of Alexander , had left in his writings concerning Nebuchadrezzar , king of the Chaldaeans : he believed him to have crossed Europe , gone into Spain , and carried his arms as far as the Pillars of Hercules . Aelian mentions Tilgamus , who is certainly the Tiglath or Teglath of sacred history , and in Ptolemy we have an enumeration of the princes who have held the great empires , among whom we find a long list of Assyrian kings who are unknown to the Greeks but whom we can easily fit into sacred history . If I wanted to report what is told us in the annals of the Syrians , in a Berossus , an Abydenus , a Nicolaus of Damascus , my discourse would become too long . Josephus and Eusebius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others which existed in their entirety in their days ; and their testimony confirms what we are told in the Scriptures concerning the ancient history of the East , and particularly the history of Assyria. // As for the monarchy of the Medes , which most of the secular historians count second in their enumeration of the great empires , and separately from that of the Persians , it is certain that the Scriptures always join them together . You can see , Monseigneur , that quite apart from the authority of the Holy Writ , the very order of the facts shows that we must look to it . Before Cyrus , the Medes , though powerful and eminent , were overshadowed by the greatness of the kings of Babylon . But since Cyrus had conquered their kingdom by the united forces of the Medes and the Persians , whose master he later became through a legitimate succession ? as we have noted , following Xenophon ? it seems that the great empire he founded must have taken its name from both these nations . Therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one and the same thing , although the glory of Cyrus gave the name of the Persians preeminence . It is also possible to think that , since the Median kings had extended their conquests in the direction of the Greek colonies in Asia Minor before the Babylonian war , they were therefore known to the Greeks , who attributed to them the empire of greater Asia because they were the only ones known to them among all the kings of the East . Yet the kings of Babylon and Nineveh , more powerful but less known to the Greeks , have been almost forgotten in the fragments of Greek histories that have come down to us ; and so the entire span of time elapsing between Sardanapalus and Cyrus has been given to the Medes alone . Thus , it is no longer necessary to make such an effort in order to reconcile secular and sacred history on this point . For regarding the first empire of the Assyrians , the Scripture mentions it only in passing and names neither Ninus , the founder of that empire , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successors , because their history has nothing in common with that of God 's people . As for the second Assyrians , most of the Greeks have either completely ignored them or , not knowing enough about them , have confused them with the first . If , therefore , anybody cites as evidence those Greek authors who arrange the first three monarchies according to their fancy and make the Medes succeed to the ancient empire of Assyria without mentioning the new one which the Scriptures show as so powerful , we have only to reply that the Greeks did not know anything about that part of history and that they are just as contrary to the most careful and learned authors of their own nation as they are to the Scriptures . To solve the difficulty in one word , then , the sacred authors , who were closer in time and space to the kingdoms of the East and who , furthermore , were writing the history of a people whose affairs were so intimately connected with those of the great empires , could , on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed them . If , however , we insist upon upholding this famous order of the first three monarchies and if , wishing to give to the Medes alone the second place which is traditionally assigned to them , we make them masters over the kings of Babylon , allowing , however , that the latter freed themselves after about 100 years of subjection ? even then we are , in a way , still saving the sequence of sacred history , but we are hardly in agreement with the best secular historians , who are confirmed by sacred history in that it always unites the empire of the Medes with that of the Persians . There is another reason for the obscurity of these ancient histories which I must explain to you . These oriental kings assumed several names or , if you prefer , several titles which came to be used as their proper names and which various peoples translated or pronounced in different ways , according to the various idioms of their languages . This fact necessarily makes histories of such antiquity , for which there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confusion of names must have caused a great deal of confusion about events and persons , and this is the reason for the difficulty of placing into Greek history the kings named Ahasuerus , a name as unknown to the Greeks as it was well known to the peoples of the East . And who , in fact , would believe that Cyaxares was the same name as Ahasuerus , composed of the word Ky , that is , lord , and Axares , which obviously comes out to be Axuerus or Ahasuerus . Three or four princes have borne this name , although they also had others . Thus there is no doubt that Darius the Mede could have been an Ahasuerus or Cyaxares , and everything tallies for giving him one of // these two names . If we had not been warned that Nebuchadrezzar and Nabocolassar are only one name or the names of one and the same man , we could hardly believe it ; and yet it is certain . It is a name derived from Nabo , one of the gods that was worshiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings in various ways . Sargon is Sennacherib ; Uzziah is Azariah ; Zedekiah is Mattaniah ; Jehoahaz is also called Shallum ; So , or Sua , is the same as Shabako , king of Ethiopia ; Asaraddon , who is differently pronounced Esar-haddon or Asorhaddan , is called Asenaphar by the Cuthaeans ; it is believed that Sardanapalus is the same whom some historians have called Sarac ; and by a whim for which we can not account , the same king happens to be called Tonos-Concoleros by the Greeks . We have already noted that Sardanapalus was probably Sardan , son of Phul or Pul . But who knows if this Phul or Pul , who is mentioned in sacred history , is not the same as Pileser ? For one of the ways of varying these names was to shorten them , to lengthen them , or to end them with different inflections , according to the structure of the languages . Thus Tiglath-Pileser , that is , Tiglath , son of Pileser , could be one of the sons of Phul who , more vigorous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire that was taken away from his family . We could establish a long list of eastern kings , each one of whom has had several different names in different histories ; but it is sufficient to be aware in general of this practice . It is not unknown to the Latins , among whom titles and adoptions have created a multiplicity of names . Thus the titles Augustus or Africanus became the proper names of Caesar Octavianus and of the Scipios ; thus the Neros became Caesars . There is no doubt about this , and a longer discussion of such an obvious fact would be useless to you . Those who are surprised at the infinite number of years the Egyptians give to themselves I refer to Herodotus , who precisely assures us , as we have seen , that their history shows some accuracy only since the time of Psammetichus , that is , 600 or 700 years before Jesus Christ . And if anybody is concerned about the length of time that is usually given to the first empire of the Assyrians , he only needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he is followed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus , the most learned of historians , and by Appian . And those who , after all that , still feel too restricted by the ordinary calculation of the years to fit in all the events and all the dates of which they feel sure , can take as much room as they wish in the number of years given by the Septuagint , which the Church leaves to their judgment . Thus they can comfortably fit in all the kings that can be given to Nineveh , with all the years that are attributed to their reigns ; all the dynasties of the Egyptians , in whatever way they wish to arrange them ; and also the entire history of China , without waiting , if they so desire , that more be known about it . Henceforth , Monseigneur , I do not intend to worry you any more with difficulties of chronology , which are of very little use to you . But the one I have been treating was too important to go unexplained at this point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes , I now resume the sequence of our epochs . Eighth Epoch CYRUS , OR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE JEWS Sixth Age of the World As we have seen , it was 218 years after the founding of Rome , 536 years before the birth of Christ , 70 years after the Babylonian Captivity , and in the same year that Cyrus founded the empire of the Persians that this prince , chosen by God to be the liberator of his people and the restorer of his Temple , put his hand to that great work . Immediately after the publication of his decree , Zerubbabel , accompanied by Joshua , son of the high priest Jozadek , led back the captives , who rebuilt the altar ( 219 A.U.C. , 535 B.C. ) and laid the foundations for the second Temple . Jealous of their glory , the Samaritans wanted to take part in the great work ; and even though they mixed his cult with that of their false gods , pretending to worship the God of Israel , they asked Zerubbabel for permission to rebuild God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // their mixed cult and rejected their advances . In their irritation , the Samaritans thwarted their plans with all kinds of tricks and violent actions . About this time , Servius Tullius , having enlarged the city of Rome , conceived the plan of making it into a republic . While he was nurturing these thoughts , he perished ( 221 A.U.C. , 533 B.C. ) through the machinations of his daughter and upon orders from his son-inlaw , Tarquinius Superbus . This tyrant invaded the kingdom , where , for a long time , he perpetrated all kinds of violence . Meanwhile , the Persian Empire was growing . Besides the immense provinces of Greater Asia , the entire vast continent of Asia Minor was under its orders ; the Syrians and the Arabs were subjugated ; and Egypt , so jealously attached to its own laws , received theirs ( 232 A.U.C. , 522 B.c . ) . This conquest was made by Cambyses , the son of Cyrus . A brutal ruler , he did not survive his brother Smerdis by much , after he had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magus Smerdis ( 233 A.U.C. , 521 B.c. ) reigned for a time under the name of Smerdis , brother of Cambyses ; but his imposture was soon discovered . The seven principal lords conspired against him , and one of them was put upon the throne . This was Darius , son of Hystaspes , who in his inscriptions called himself the best and most handsome of men . A number of indications identify him as the Ahasuerus of the Book of Esther , although opinion on this is divided . At the beginning of his reign , the Temple was completed , after various interruptions caused by the Samaritans . Irreconcilable hatred sprang up between the two nations , and there was no greater opposition than that between Jerusalem and Samaria . The time of Darius marks the beginning of the liberty of Rome and Athens ( 241 A.U.C. , 513 B.c. ) and of the great glory that was Greece . The Athenians , Harmodius and Aristogeiton , delivered their country from Hipparchus , the son of Peisistratus , and were killed by his guards . Hippias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power . He was driven out , and the tyranny of the Peisistratids was completely extinguished ( 244 A.U.C. , 510 B.c . ) . After their liberation , the Athenians erected statues to their liberators and reestablished the democratic state . Hippias cast his lot with Darius , finding him ready to undertake the conquest of Greece , and placed his last hope in his protection . At the time he was driven out , Rome also ridded itself of its tyrants . The violence of Tarquinius Superbus had made kingship hateful ( 245 A.u.C. , 509 B.C. ) , and the shamelessness of his son Sextus led to its final abolition . When Lucretia was dishonored , she killed herself ; and her blood and Brutus 's harangues stirred up the Romans . The kings were banished , and the consular empire was established , following the plans of Servius Tullius . But it was soon weakened by the jealousy of the people . In the very first consulate P ( ( ublius Valerius , a consul famous for his victories , became suspect to his fellow citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass a law permitting an appeal from the consuls and the senate to the people in all cases involving the punishment of a citizen . In exile , the Tarquins found defenders : the neighboring kings regarded their banishment as an insult to all kings ; and Porsena , the king of the Clusians , an Etruscan people , took up arms against Rome ( 247 A.U.C. , 507 B.C. ) . Reduced to extremity and almost defeated , it was saved by the valor of Horatius Cocles . The Romans performed great feats for their liberty . Scaevola , a young citizen , burnt his own hand , which had missed Porsena ; and Clelia , a young maiden , astonished Porsena by her boldness . Porsena left Rome in peace , and the Tarquins were left without resources . Hippias , who was championed by Darius ( 254 A.U.C. , 500 B.C. ) , had better hopes . All of Persia was stirring in his favor , and Athens was threatened with a great war . While Darius was making preparations ( 261 A.U.C. , 493 B.C. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsiders , almost destroyed itself . New jealousy had sprung up between the patricians and the people ; the consular power , though already curbed by the law of P. Valerius , still seemed excessive to a people overly solicitous of its liberty . The people retreated to the Aventine Hill . Threatening commands were useless ; the people could be brought back only by the peaceful remonstrances of Menenius Agrippa . But an accommodation had to be found , and it was necessary to give the people tribunes to defend them against the consuls . The law establishing this new magistracy was called the Sacred Law ; and this is the beginning of the people 's tribunes. // Darius had finally struck out against Greece . His son-in-law Mardonius , having crossed Asia , was planning to crush Greece with his numerous army . But Miltiades defeated this immense army on the plains of Marathon with 10,000 Athenians ( 264 A.U.C. , 490 B.c . ) . Rome defeated all the enemies surrounding it and seemed to have only itself to fear . Coriolanus , a zealous patrician and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction despite his services , was plotting the destruction of his country , led the Volscians against it ( 265 A.U.C. , 489 B.C. ) , reduced it to extremity ( 266 A.U.C. , 488 B.c. ) , and could be appeased only by his mother . Greece was not long to enjoy the respite the Battle of Marathon had given it . In order to avenge the affront to Persia and to Darius , Xerxes , his son and successor , and also the grandson of Cyrus through his mother , Atossa , attacked the Greeks ( 274 A.U.C. , 480 B.C. ) with 1,100,000 fighting men ( others say 1,700,000 ) , not counting his naval army of 1,200 ships . Leonidas , king of Sparta , who had only 300 men , killed 20,000 of Xerxes ' men at the pass of Thermopylae and perished there with his men . By the strategy of the Athenian Themistocles , the naval army of Xerxes was defeated in the same year near Salamis . Terror-stricken , this prince went back across the Hellespont ; and a year later his land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces near Plataea ( 275 A.U.C. , 479 B.C. ) by Pausanias , king of Sparta , and Aristides , called the Just , an Athenian . The battle took place in the morning , and on the evening of that famous day the Ionian Greeks , who had just shaken off the Persian yoke , killed 30,000 of their men in the Battle of Mycale , under the command of Leotychides . To encourage his soldiers , this general told them that Mardonius had just been defeated in Greece . This news turned out to be true , either because of prodigiously rapid communications or , more probably , because of a happy coincidence ; and all the Greeks of Asia Minor liberated themselves . Everywhere this nation obtained great advantages ; and , some time before this , the Carthaginians , who were powerful at that time , were beaten in Sicily , to which they wanted to extend their domination at the insistence of the Persians . Despite this setback , they never ceased their attempts on an island so well suited to giving their republic the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination was in the hands of Greece ; but Greece then ( 277 A.u.c. , 477 B.C. ) was looking only toward the East and the Persians . Pausanias had just liberated the island of Cyprus from the Persian yoke ( 278 A.u.c. , 476 B.C. ) when he conceived the plan to enslave his own country . All his projects came to naught , although Xerxes promised him everything ; the traitor was betrayed by the man he loved the most ( 280 A.U.C. , 474 B.C. ) , and his shameful love cost him his life . In the same year , Xerxes was killed by Artabanus , who was the captain of his guards , either because that traitor wanted to occupy the throne of his master or because he feared the reprisals of a prince whose cruel orders he had not executed promptly enough . Artaxerxes the Long-handed , his son , began his reign , and shortly thereafter he received a letter from Themistocles ( 281 A.u.C. , 473 B.C. ) , who , outlawed by his fellow citizens , offered him his services against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such renown and set him up in the grand manner , despite the jealousy of his satraps . This magnanimous king protected the Jewish people ( 287 A.U.C. , 467 B.C. ) ; and in his twentieth year ( 300 A.U.C. , 454 B.C. ) , which subsequently was to become memorable , he permitted Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem with its walls . This decree of Artaxerxes differs from Cyrus 's decree , in that the latter concerned the Temple , while the former concerned the city . Foreseen by Daniel and included in his prophecy , this decree marks the beginning of the 490 years of his weeks . This important date rests on solid foundations . In the Chronicle of Eusebius the date of the banishment of Themistocles is given as the last year of the 76th olympiad , meaning the year 280 of Rome . The other chronologists give a somewhat later date ; but the difference is small , and the circumstances of the times assure the date of Eusebius . They are taken from Thucydides , a very exact historian ; and this serious author , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Themistocles , says that Themistocles wrote his letter at the beginning of Artaxerxes ' reign . Cornelius Nepos , an ancient historian who is as judicious as he is elegant , feels that this date should not be doubted , since it has the authority of Thucydides ; and this reasoning is all the sounder since an even older author than Thucydides is of the same opinion . This is Charon of Lampsacus , whom Plutarch // cites ; and Plutarch himself adds that the Annals , that is , those of Persia , are in agreement with these two authors . Yet he does not follow them without giving any reason ; and the historians who place the beginning of the reign of Artaxerxes eight or nine years later are neither contemporaries nor do they have as much authority . There seems to be no doubt , therefore , that we must place the beginning of that reign toward the end of the 76th olympiad and close to the year 280 of Rome , whence the twentieth year of that prince must occur toward the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , in order to reconcile their authors , those who adopt a later beginning of the reign of Artaxerxes are forced to conjecture that his father had at least associated him with his reign when Themistocles wrote his letter ; so that , in any case , our date is assured . On this foundation , it is easy to make the rest of the calculation , and what follows will show it to be correct . After the decree of Artaxerxes , the Jews set to work restoring their city and its walls , as Daniel had foreseen . Nehemiah conducted the works with much firmness and prudence in the face of the resistance of the Samaritans , the Arabs , and the Ammonites . The people made a great effort , and Eliashib , the high priest , inspired them by his example . Meanwhile , the new magistrates that had been given to the Roman people exacerbated the divisions within that city . Having been shaped by kings , Rome lacked the laws necessary for the proper functioning of a republic . The reputation of Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inspired the Romans to model their rules upon that example ( 302 A.U.C. , 452 B.c . ) . They therefore sent deputies to study the laws of the Greek cities , and especially those of Athens , where conditions were similar to conditions in their own republic . Following this model , ten absolute magistrates , created the following year ( 303 A.U.C. , 451 B.c. ) and called decemvirs , wrote the Laws of the Twelve Tables , the foundation of Roman law . Delighted with the equity they brought to that task , the Roman people permitted them to encroach upon the sovereign power , which they proceeded to use tyrannically ( 305 A.U.c. , 449 B.c . ) . At that time , great disturbances were created by the intemperance of Appius Claudius , one of the decemvirs , and by the murder of Virginia , whose father preferred killing her with his own hands to abandoning her to the passion of Appius . The blood of this second Lucretia awakened the Roman people , and the decemvirs were expelled . While the Roman laws were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law , and Nehemiah , the governor of God 's people , newly established in Judaea , reformed abuses and enforced the Mosaic Law , which they were the first to obey . One of the foremost aims of their reforms was to make all the people , and especially the priests , repudiate the foreign women they had married despite the prohibition of the law . Ezra put the sacred books in order , revising them painstakingly , and brought together the ancient memoirs of God 's people in order to compose the two books of Paralipomena or Chronicles , adding to them the history of his own time , which was completed by Nehemiah . Their books complete the long history begun by Moses and continued by subsequent authors without interruption until the restoration of Jerusalem . The remainder of sacred history is not part of the same sequence . While Ezra and Nehemiah were occupied with the last part of this great work , Herodotus , whom secular writers call the Father of History , began to write . Thus the last authors of sacred history meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it began , the history of God 's people ? to take it only since Abraham ? already comprised fifteen centuries . Herodotus was not in a position to mention the Jews in the history he has left us ; and the Greeks needed to learn only about peoples who became known to them through war , commerce , or some great exploit . Judaea was just beginning to recover from its fall and did not attract attention . In these unhappy times , the Hebrew language began to be mixed with Chaldaean , which was spoken in Babylon while the people were in captivity there ; but Hebrew was still understood by the majority of the people at the time of Ezra , as it appears when he read them the books of the law , " before both men and women ; and all the multitude gave heed unto the law ... because they understood the words wherein they were instructed . " From that time on , Hebrew gradually ceased to be the spoken language . During the Captivity , and later through the necessary contacts with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was rather close to their own and had almost the same structure . For this reason , they changed the ancient form of the Hebrew letters and wrote Hebrew with Chaldaean letters , which were more current among them and also easier to write . Such a change was easily made between two related languages in which the letters had the same value and differed only in form . Henceforth , among the Jews , we find the sacred Scriptures written only in Chaldaean characters . I said that the Scriptures are found only in these characters among the Jews . But in our time a Pentateuch in ancient Hebrew characters , such as can be seen in the medals and other monuments of earlier centuries , was discovered among the Samaritans . This Pentateuch does not differ from that of the Jews , except that it is falsified in one place in favor of holding the public worship on Mount Gerizim near Samaria , where the Samaritans claimed God had established it , just as the Jews claimed it was in Jerusalem . There are some other differences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church Fathers , among others St. Eusebius and St. Jerome , saw this Samaritan Pentateuch and also that our Pentateuch shows all the characteristics of the one they mention . In order to understand the ancient history of God 's people perfectly , we must at this point trace the history of the Samaritans and their Pentateuch in a few words . In order to do this , we must remember that after Solomon , and as a punishment for his excesses , Jeroboam separated ten tribes from the kingdom of Judah under Solomon 's son Rehoboam , forming the kingdom of Israel , the capital of which became Samaria . Thus separated , this kingdom no longer sacrificed in the Temple of Jerusalem and rejected all the Scriptures written after David and Solomon . Neither did it heed the decrees of these two kings , one of whom had prepared the Temple , while the other had constructed and dedicated it . Rome was founded in the year 3250 of the world , and thirty-three years later , that is , in the year 3283 , the ten schismatic tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the Assyrian king Esar-haddon , the Cuthaeans were sent to inhabit Samaria . They were peoples from Assyria who later came to be called Samaritans . They mixed the worship of God with that of their idols , and Esar-haddon gave them an Israelite priest who taught them the worship of the local god , that is , the observances of the Law of Moses . But their priest gave them only the books of Moses , which the apostate tribes continued to hold in veneration , not adding the other sacred books for the reasons we have just seen . Instructed in this manner , the inhabitants of Samaria have always persisted in the hatred of the ten tribes for the Jews ; and when Cyrus permitted the Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem , the Samaritans did everything in their power to thwart their designs , feigning nonetheless a desire to take part in it and claiming to worship the God of Israel , even though they mixed his worship with that of their false divinities . They continued to thwart the designs of the Jews when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the enmity between the two nations persisted . Here we see the reason why they did not change the Hebrew characters into Chaldaeic characters , as the Jews did . They had no desire to imitate the Jews any more than their great doctor Ezra , since they detested them . Therefore , their Pentateuch is written in ancient Hebrew characters , as we have pointed out . Alexander gave them permission to build the temple of Gerizim . Manasseh , the brother of Jaddua , the high priest of the Jews , who embraced the schism of the Samaritans , obtained permission to build this temple ; and apparently it was under him that they began to abandon the worship of the false gods , differing from the Jews only in that they wanted to serve God on Mount Gerizim rather than at Jersualem , as he had ordered . Here we see the reason why , in their Pentateuch , they have falsified the passage where Mount Gerizim is mentioned , for the purpose of showing that this place rather than Jerusalem was blessed by God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples never subsided , and the Samaritans always claimed that their temple should be preferred to that of Jerusalem . The dispute was argued before Ptolemy Philometor , king of Egypt . Having the succession and an unbroken tradition on their side , the Jews won their case in a solemn judgment . // The Samaritans , who , during the persecutions by Antiochus and the Syrian kings , had always joined forces with them against the Jews , were subjugated by John Hyrcanus , the son of Simon , who destroyed their temple of Gerizim but was unable to prevent them from continuing to worship on the mountain where it had stood or to bring this stubborn people to the Temple of Jerusalem for worship . This is why , at the time of Jesus Christ , we still see Samaritans attached to the same cult and condemned by Jesus Christ . Ever since this time , this people has continued to exist in two or three places in the East . One of our travelers has met them and has brought back with him the text of the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is and can understand perfectly why it has remained in the state in which we find it . The Jews lived peacefully under the authority of Artaxerxes . This prince , reduced by Cimon , the son of the Athenian general Miltiades , to a shameful peace , lost all hopes of defeating the Greeks by force and endeavored to profit from their division . Great divisions did spring up between the Athenians and the Spartans . These two rival peoples shared all of Greece between them . The Athenian , Pericles , began the Peloponnesian War ( 323 A.U.C. , 431 B.C. ) , in which his countrymen Theramenes , Alcibiades , and Thrasybulus distinguished themselves . The Spartans Brasidas and Mindarus died in that war , fighting for their country . The war lasted twenty-seven years and ended to the advantage of Sparta , which had obtained the support of Darius , called the Bastard , the son and successor of Artaxerxes . Lysander , the general of the Spartan naval army , took Athens and changed its government ( 350 A.U.C. , 404 B.C. ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful . They gave their support ( 353 A.u.c. , 401 B.C. ) to Cyrus the Younger , who revolted against his older brother Artaxerxes , called Mnemon because of his excellent memory , who was the son and successor of Darius . This young prince , saved from prison and death by his mother , Parysatis , sought revenge , won over the satraps by his infinite charm , crossed Asia Minor , gave battle to the king his brother in the heart of his country , wounded him with his own hand , nd , too soon believing himself victorious , paid with his life for his merity . The 10,000 Greeks in his service made that astonishing the council of Jerusalem and his brother Jaddua demanded , he embraced the schism of the Samaritans . Several Jews joined him in order to avoid similar strictures . He immediately resolved to build a temple near Samaria , on Mount Gerizim , which the Samaritans believed blessed , and to become its priest . His father-in-law , who had much influence with Darius , assured him of the protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . When Alexander became powerful ( 442 A.U.C. , 332 B.C. ) , Sanballat deserted his master and brought troops over to the victor at the siege of Tyre . Thus he obtained everything he wanted ; the temple of Gerizim was built , and the ambition of Manasseh was satisfied . But the Jews remained loyal to the Persians and refused to give Alexander the help he demanded . Resolved to take revenge , he came to Jerusalem ; but he was changed at the sight of the high priest coming toward him with the sacrificers clad in their ceremonial robes and preceded by all the people dressed in white . He was shown the prophecies predicting his victories ? the prophecies of Daniel . He granted the Jews all their demands , and henceforth they were as loyal to him as they had always been to the kings of Persia . While Alexander was making his conquests , Rome was engaged in the struggle with the Samnites , its neighbors ( 428-30 A.U.C. , 324 B.c. ) , who proved extremely difficult to subdue , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman generals . After Alexander 's death , his empire was divided ( 430 A.U.C. , 324 B.C. ) . Perdiccas , Ptolemy , son of Lagus , Antigonus , Seleucus , Lysimachus , Antipater , and his son Cassander ? in a word , all the captains trained in war under so great a conqueror ? hoped to become its master by force . They sacrificed all of Alexander 's family to their ambition ? his brother , his mother , his wives , his children , and even his sisters ( 430-45 A.U.C. , 324-309 B.C. ) . There was nothing but bloodshed , battles , and dreadful revolutions . In the midst of all this disorder , several nations of Asia Minor and surrounding regions liberated themselves , forming the kingdoms of Pontus , Bithynia , and Pergamum . The bounty of the land was to make them rich and powerful . At the same time , Armenia also shook off the Macedonian yoke and became a great kingdom . The two Mithradates , father and son , founded the kingdom of Cappadocia. // But the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , founded ( 431 A.U.C. , 323 B.c. ) by Ptolemy , the son of Lagus , whence we speak of the Lagids , and that of Asia or Syria , founded ( 442 A.U.C. , 312 B.C. ) by Seleucus , whence we speak of the Seleucids . Aside from Syria , the latter realm included those vast and rich provinces of Upper Asia which had belonged to the Persian Empire . In this manner , all of the East came to know Greece and learned its language . Greece itself was subjugated by Alexander 's captains . Macedonia , his original realm , which had given masters to all the East , fell prey to all comers . The children of Cassander drove each other out of the kingdom ( 458 A.U.C. , 296 B.C. ) . Pyrrhus , king of Epirus , who had occupied part of it ( 460 A.U.C. , 294 B.c. ) , was driven out by Demetrius Poliorcetes , the son of Antigonus ( 465 A.U.C. , 289 B.c. ) , whom he then drove out in his turn ( 468 A.U.C. , 286 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time by Lysimachus ( 473 A.U.C. , 281 B.c. ) , and Lysimachus by Seleucus , whom Ptolemy Ceraunus ( 474 A.U.C. , 280 B.C. ) , driven out of Egypt by his father , Ptolemy I , treacherously killed , despite his many kindnesses . No sooner had this traitor invaded Macedonia than he was attacked by the Gauls and killed in a battle he gave them ( 475 A.U.C. , 279 B.c . ) . During the disturbances in the East , the Gauls came to Asia Minor , led by their king , Brennus , and settled in Gallo-Graecia , or Galatia , thus named after them . From there they assaulted Macedonia , devastated it , and frightened all of Greece . But their army perished in a sacrilegious attempt on the temple of Delphi ( 476 A.U.C. , 278 B.C. ) . This nation was stirring everywhere , and everywhere there was discontent . Some years before the affair of Delphi , the Gauls of Italy , who had become the ' terror of the Romans by their continuous wars and frequent victories , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Etruscans ( 471 A.U.C. , 283 B.C. ) . At first they reaped another victory , but they sullied its glory when they put to death some ambassadors . Outraged , the Romans marched against them ( 472 A.U.C. , 282 B.C. ) , defeated them , entered their territory , where they founded a colony , and defeated them twice more , subjugating one part of them and forcing the other to sue for peace . After the Gauls of the East had been driven out of Greece The first of these wars ( 494 A.U.C. , 260 B.C. ) taught the Romans naval warfare . From the outset they mastered an art unknown to them , and the consul Duilius , who fought the first naval battle ( 495 A.u.c. , 259 B.C. ) , won it . Regulus upheld this glory and landed in Africa ( 498 A.U.C. , 256 B.C. ) , where he had to employ his entire army in combatting this prodigious serpent . Everything gave way , and in this extreme peril , Carthage was able to save itself only through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was defeated and taken prisoner ( 499 A.U.C. , 255 B.C. ) ; but his capture gave him greater glory than his victories . Released on parole to arrange the exchange of prisoners , he went to the senate to speak in favor of the law that extinguished all hope for anyone who permitted himself to be captured , and returned to a certain death . Two dreadful shipwrecks forced the Romans to give the domination of the seas back to the Carthaginians . For a long time victory hung in the balance between the two nations , and the Romans almost had to yield . Yet they repaired their fleet . A single battle brought the decision ( 513 A.U.C. , 241 B.C. ) , and the consul Lutatius ( ( Lutatius Catulus ended the war . Carthage was forced to pay tribute and to leave not only Sicily but all the islands between Sicily and Italy . The Romans won all of that island , except the parts held by Hiero , the king of Syracuse , their ally . After the end of the war , an uprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . According to their custom , they were using foreign troops , who revolted for their pay . The Carthaginians ' harsh rule caused almost all the cities of their empire to join these mutinous troops , and Carthage , under a close siege , would have been lost without Hamilcar , surnamed Barca . He alone had borne the burden of the last war ( 516 A.U.C. , 238 B.C. ) . Now his fellow citizens also owed him their victory over the rebels . Still , that victory cost them Sardinia , which the revolt of their garrison opened to the Romans . Fearful of becoming embroiled in another quarrel with Rome , Carthage unwillingly ceded this important island and augmented its tribute . Badly shaken by the revolt , Carthage was planning to reestablish its empire in Spain . Hamilcar went to that province with his son Hannibal ( 524 A.U.C. , 230 B.C. ) , aged nine , and eventually died there in a battle . During the nine years that he // fought there , with as much cunning as valor , his son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was conceiving an unrelenting hatred for the Romans . His ally Hasdrubal was made successor to his father . He governed his province with much prudence and built New Carthage there , which held Spain in subjection . The Romans were occupied in a war with Teuta , queen of Illyria , who practiced piracy all along the coast with impunity . Gorged with the booty she took from the Greeks and the inhabitants of Epirus ( 525 A.U.C. , 229 B.c. ) , she had no respect for the Romans and killed their ambassador . She was soon brought low . The Romans left her only a small part of Illyria ( 526 A.U.C. , 228 B.c. ) and gained the island of Corfu , which she had usurped . Then they made themselves respected in Greece with a solemn embassy , and it was the first time that their power became known in these parts . The great progress of Hasdrubal made them uneasy ; but the Gauls of Italy prevented them from dealing with the affairs of Spain . The Gauls had remained quiet for forty-five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer remembered past losses and began to threaten Rome . In order to attack such turbulent neighbors safely , the Romans assured themselves of the Carthaginians . A treaty was concluded with Hasdrubal , who promised not to go beyond the Ebro . The war between the Romans and the Gauls was fought with passion on both sides ( 530 A.u.c. , 224 B.c . ) . The Transalpines joined the Cisalpines , but all of them were defeated . Concolitanus , one of the Gallic kings , was captured in battle , and Aneroestus , another king , killed himself . The victorious Romans crossed the Po for the first time , firmly resolved to deprive the Gauls of the region around this river , which they had held for so many centuries . Victory followed them wherever they went ; Milan was taken , and almost all of the country was subjugated . In these times , Hasdrubal died ( 534 A.u.c. , 220 B.c. ) , and Hannibal , even though only twenty-five years old , was put in his place . From that moment on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjugate Spain , without any respect for treaties ( 505 A.u.c. , 219 B.c . ) . The complaints of Saguntum , its rates , the Father of Medicine , who made his mark with the others in these fortunate times for Greece . At the same time , the Romans had another kind of philosophy , which had nothing to do with disputations or discourses but consisted of frugality , poverty , and the hardships of rustic life and war . They found their glory in that of their fatherland and of the Roman name , and this finally made them masters over Italy and Carthage . Ninth Epoch SCIPIO , OR THE FALL OF CARTHAGE In the year 552 after the founding of Rome , about 250 years after the founding of the Persian monarchy and 202 years before Jesus Christ , Carthage was subjugated by the Romans . This did not prevent Hannibal from surreptitiously stirring up enemies against them wherever he could ; but these actions served only to involve all his old and new friends in the ruin of his country and himself . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macedonia , an ally of the Carthaginians , was struck down ( 556 A.U.C. , 198 B.C. ) , the power of the kings of Macedonia was severely curtailed , and Greece was freed from their yoke ( 558 A.U.C. , 196 B.C. ) . The Romans decided to put Hannibal to death , still finding him dangerous , even after his defeat . Reduced to fleeing his country , this great captain stirred up the East against them and drew their armies into Asia ( 559 A.U.C. , 195 B.C. ) . His powerful reasoning made the king of Syria , Antiochus , surnamed the Great , jealous of their power , so that he declared war against them ( 561 A.U.C. , 193 B.C. ) . But during that war , he did not follow the strategy of Hannibal , who had brought him into it . Defeated on land and sea , he received the law imposed by the consul Lucius Scipio , brother of Scipio Africanus , and was confined to the Taurus Mountains . Hannibal , having sought refuge with Prusias , king of Bithynia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. ) . The Romans were feared throughNinth // out the world and no longer wanted to tolerate any power but their own . Kings were obliged to give them their children as hostages for their loyalty . Antiochus , later called the Illustrious or Epiphanes , second son of Antiochus the Great , king of Syria , spent a long time in Rome in these circumstances , but toward the end of the reign of his older brother , Seleucus Philopator , he was released ( 578 A.U.C. , 176 B.C. ) . In his place the Romans demanded Demetrius Soter , the king 's son , who was ten years old at the time . In this difficult situation , Seleucus died ( 579 A.U.C. , 175 B.c. ) , and Antiochus usurped the kingdom from his nephew . The Romans became involved with the affairs of Macedonia , where Perseus alarmed his neighbors and no longer wanted to abide by the conditions imposed on his father , King Philip . It was at this time that the persecutions of God 's people began ( 581 A.U.C. , 173 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he turned all his fury against the Jews and aimed at destroying the Temple , the Law of Moses , and the entire nation . The authority of the Romans prevented him from becoming master of Egypt ( 583 A.U.C. , 171 B.c . ) . They went to war against Perseus , who , quicker to undertake something than to see it through , lost his allies through his avarice and his armies through his cowardice . Defeated by the consul Paulus Aemilius ( 586 A.U.C. , 168 B.c. ) , he was forced to surrender to him . King Gentius of Illyria , his ally , had been defeated in thirty days by the praetor Anicius and had just met with a similar fate . The kingdom of Macedonia , which had lasted for 700 years , and for almost 200 years had given masters not only to Greece but to all the East , was reduced to the status of a Roman province . Antiochus ' fury against God 's people was mounting . Here we see the emergence of the resistance of Mattathias , a sacrificer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders for the preservation of his people he gave before he died ( 587 A.U.C. , 67 B.C. ) ; the victories of his son , Judas Maccabaeus ( 588 A.U.C. , 166 B.C. ) , over his numerous enemies ; the rise of the Hasmonaean or accabee family ( 589 A.U.C. , 165 B.C. ) ; the new dedication of the emple , which had been desecrated by the pagans ; the rule of Judas d the renewed splendor of the priesthood ( 590 A.U.C. , 164 B.C. ) ; c death of Antiochus , which was worthy of his impiety and arrogance ; his false conversion during his last illness , and God 's unrelenting wrath directed against this haughty king . His son Antiochus Eupator , as yet a minor , succeeded him under the tutelage of his preceptor , Lysias . During his minority , Demetrius Soter , who was in Rome as a hostage , felt that he might be able to reestablish himself . But he could not persuade the senate to send him back to his country : Roman policies were served better by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's people ( 591 A.U.C. , 163 B.C. ) and the victories of Judas Maccabaeus ( 592 A.U.C. , 162 B.C. ) continued . Divisiveness arose in the kingdom of Syria . Demetrius escaped from Rome ; the people recognized him , and young Antiochus was killed , along with his tutor , Lysias . But the Jews fared no better under Demetrius than under his predecessors . He soon met the same fate : his generals were defeated by Judas Maccabaeus , and the hand of the arrogant Nicanor , which had so often threatened the Temple , was nailed to its walls . But , shortly thereafter , Judas was overcome by a great multitude and died while fighting with astounding valor ( 593 A.U.C. , 161 B.C. ) . His brother Jonathan succeeded to his position and upheld his reputation . Faced with extreme danger , he did not lose his courage . The Romans , delighted with the opportunity to humiliate the kings of Syria , granted the Jews their protection . The alliance which Judas had demanded was concluded , yet no help was forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong support for the afflicted people . The disorders in Syria were becoming more severe every day . Alexander Balas , who boasted of being a son of Antiochus the Illustrious , was put on the throne by the people of Antioch ( 600 A.U.C. , 154 B.C. ) . The kings of Egypt , perpetual enemies of Syria , took sides in these struggles in order to profit from them . Ptolemy Philometor supported Balas . The ensuing war was most violent . Demetrius Soter was killed ( 604 A.U.C. , 150 B.C. ) and left only two princes , still in their minority , to avenge his death . Their names were Demetrius Nicator and Antiochus Sidetes . Thus the usurper was undisturbed , and the king of Egypt gave him his daughter Cleopatra in marriage . Balas , who believed himself to be // above everything , plunged into debauchery and thus made all his subjects despise him . At this time , Philometor judged the famous law case which the Samaritans brought against the Jews ( 604 A.U.C. , 150 B.C. ) . This schismatic people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to join their enemies ; and in order to please their persecutor , Antiochus the Illustrious , they had consecrated their temple of Gerizim to Zeus Xenios , god of hospitality ( 587 A.U.C. , 167 B.C. ) . Despite this profanation , these impious people still claimed , some time later , before Ptolemy Philometor in Alexandria , that their temple should be preferred to that of Jerusalem . The two parties contested before the king , and both pledged their lives to substantiate their claims in terms of the Law of Moses . The Jews won their case , and the Samaritans were given a death sentence , as had been agreed . The same king gave permission to Onias , a member of the priestly family , to build the temple of Heliopolis in Egypt , modeled after that of Jerusalem . But this undertaking was condemned by the entire council of the Jews as being contrary to the law . Meanwhile , there was unrest in Carthage , which was chafing under the rule imposed by Scipio Africanus . The Romans resolved on the complete destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young Demetrius Nicator , now past his childhood , hoped to regain the throne of his ancestors ( 606 A.U.C. , 148 B.c. ) , and the usurper 's decadence gave him every hope of success . As he was drawing near , Balas became disturbed ( 608 A.u.c. , 146 B.c . ) . His father-in-law came out against him because Balas did not permit him to take over his kingdom . The ambitious Cleopatra , his wife , left him in order to marry his enemy , and he finally perished by the hand of his own men after he had lost one battle . Philometor died a few days later from the wounds he had received , and Syria was delivered from two enemies . This time also witnessed the fall of two great cities . Carthage was taken and burnt to the ground by Scipio Aemilianus , who , by that victory , confirmed the name of Africanus for his family and showed himself a worthy heir of the great Scipio , his grandfather . The city of Corinth met with the same fate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consul Mummius utterly devastated that city , the most voluptuous and beautiful of all Greek cities . He brought its incomparable statues to Rome without knowing their value . The Romans knew nothing about the arts of Greece , being satisfied with their knowledge of war , politics , and agriculture . During the disturbances in Syria , the Jews strengthened their position . Jonathan was sought after by both parties , and the victorious Nicator treated him as a brother . For this he was soon rewarded . When there was a revolt ( 610 A.U.C. , 144 B.C. ) , the Jews came to his aid and freed him from the hands of the rebels . Jonathan was overwhelmed with honors ; but when the king felt himself secure , he reverted to the ways of his ancestors , and the Jews were tormented as before . New disturbances arose in Syria . Diodotus , surnamed Tryphon , brought up a son of Balas , whom he named Antiochus Theos and served as his guardian during his minority . The arrogance of Demetrius led to a popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how to profit from the situation and renewed the alliance with the Romans ( 611 A.U.C. , 143 B.c . ) . Everything was going well for him when Tryphon , breaking his word , had him and his children killed . His brother Simon , the most prudent and fortunate of the Maccabees , succeeded him , and the Romans favored him , as they had favored his predecessors . Tryphon was just as faithless with his ward Antiochus as he had been with Jonathan . He did away with this child by means of the physicians , under the pretext of removing a stone which was not there , and then made himself master over part of the kingdom . Simon sided with Demetrius Nicator , the legitimate king . Having obtained his country 's liberty from him , he defended that liberty with armed force against the rebel Tryphon . The Syrians were driven from the citadel they held in Jerusalem ( 612 A.U.C. , 142 B.C. ) and eventually from all their strongholds in Judaea . Thus freed from the yoke of the heathen by Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal prerogatives ; and Demetrius Nicator gave his consent . This is the beginning of the new kingdom of God 's people and of the Hasmonaean dynasty , which remained united with the high priesthood . In these times the empire of the Parthians extended over Bactria and India following the victories of Mithradates ( 613 A.U.C. , 141 B.c. ) , the most valiant of the Arsacidae . While he was advancing toward the Euphrates , Demetrius Nicator , called in by the inhabitants of that region , who had just been subjugated by Mithradates , hoped to force the obedience of the Parthians , whom the Syrians still considered rebels . He gained a number of victories ; but when he was ready to return to Syria , where he planned to crush Tryphon , he fell into the ambush which one of Mithradates ' generals had prepared for him . Thus he remained a prisoner of the Parthians . Tryphon , who had believed himself strengthened by the misfortune of that prince , suddenly found himself deserted by his men ( 614 A.u.c. , 140 B.c . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demetrius , their legitimate king , was in captivity , they gave their allegiance to his wife , Cleopatra , and to her children . But a defender had to be found for these princes , since they were still minors . This task naturally fell to Antiochus Sidetes , the brother of Demetrius ; and Cleopatra had him recognized throughout the kingdom . She did even more : Phraates , the brother and successor to Mithradates , treated Nicator as the king and gave him his daughter Rhodogune in marriage . Out of hatred for this rival , who robbed her of her crown and her husband , Cleopatra married Antiochus Sidetes and resolved to rule by all manner of crime . The new king attacked Tryphon , and Simon joined forces with him in this undertaking ( 615 A.u.c. , 139 B.C. ) ; and the tyrant , defeated in all his strongholds , met the end he deserved . Once master of the kingdom ( 619 A.U.C. , 135 B.c . ) , Antiochus soon forgot the services Simon had rendered him in this war and put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Syria against the Jews , John Hyrcanus , Simon 's son , succeeded to his father 's priesthood , and all the people submitted to him . He sustained the siege of Jerusalem with much bravery ; and when Antiochus was contemplating a war against the Parthians in order to deliver his captive brother , he decided to grant the Jews tolerable conditions . While this peace was being concluded , the Romans , who were becoming too wealthy , found a formidable enemy in the tremendous number of their slaves . Eunus , himself a slave , incited them to revolt in Sicily ( 621 A.U.C. , 133 B.c. ) , and it took all of the power of Rome to put them down . A little later , the succession of Attalus , king of Pergamum , who had designated the Roman people as his heir in his testament , brought dissension to the city . The disorders of the Gracchi began . The seditious tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus , one of the leading Romans , put him to death : the entire senate killed him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to put a stop to the dangerous practice of distributing money , with which the eloquent tribune wooed the people . Scipio Aemilianus restored military discipline , and this great man , who had destroyed Carthage , also ruined Numantia in Spain , the other terror of Rome . The Parthians were too weak to resist Sidetes . His troops , though corrupted by prodigious luxury , were surprisingly successful ( 622 A.U.C. , 132 B.C. ) . John Hyrcanus , who fought alongside Sidetes in this war , together with his Jews , distinguished himself by his gallantry and commanded respect for the Jewish religion when the army paused to give him leisure to celebrate a religious holiday . Everything gave way , and Phraates saw his empire reduced to its former limits ; but , far from giving up hope , he believed that he could use his prisoner to restore his position and to invade Syria . Under these circumstances , a bizarre fate befell Demetrius . He was often released , and as many times retained as prisoner , depending on whether hope or fear had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a fortunate moment , when Phraates saw in him his only hope of diverting Syria , he was definitively set free ( 624 A.U.C. , 130 B.C. ) . This was the turning point . Sidetes , who could sustain his tremendous expenses only by intolerable depredations , was suddenly struck by a general uprising of the people and perished with his army ? an army that had been almost undefeated in the past . In vain Phraates tried to catch up with Demetrius , but it was too late ; he had already reached his kingdom . His wife , Cleopatra , whose only aim was to rule , soon went back to him , and Rhodogune was forgotten . Hyrcanus took advantage of the times . He took Shechem from the Samaritans and completely devastated the temple of Gerizim , 200 years after it had been built by Sanballat . Its ruin did not prevent the Samaritans from worshiping on that mountain , and the two nations remained irreconcilable . In the next year ( 625 A.U.C. , 129 B.C. ) all of Idumaea , united to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , received the Law of Moses and began to practice circumcision . The Romans continued to give protection to Hyrcanus and ordered the restoration of the towns taken from him by the Syrians . The arrogance and violence of Demetrius Nicator ( 626 A.U.C. , 128 B.c. ) did not permit Syria to remain quiet for long . The people revolted ( 629 A.U.C. , 125 B.c . ) . To fan their revolt , hostile Egypt gave them a king , namely , Alexander Zabinas , son of Balas . Demetrius was defeated , and Cleopatra , his wife , who believed that she could rule more absolutely under her children than under her husband , had him killed . Nor did she treat her oldest son , Seleucus , any better when he wanted to rule against her will . Her second son , Antiochus , surnamed Grypus , had put down the rebels ( 630 A.U.C. , 124 B.c. ) ; and when he returned , victorious , Cleopatra ceremoniously offered him a poisoned cup , which he , warned of her deadly intentions , made her drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she died , she left an eternal seed of dissension among the children she had had by the two brothers , Demetrius Nicator and Antiochus Sidetes . In the throes of such agitation , Syria was no longer in a position to interfere with the Jews . John Hyrcanus took Samaria but was unable to convert the Samaritans . Five years later he died , and Judaea remained the peaceful possession of his two sons , Aristobulus ( 650 A.U.C. , 104 B.c. ) and Alexander Jannaeus ( 651 A.U.C. , 103 B.c. ) , who reigned one after the other without being disturbed by the kings of Syria . The Romans left this wealthy kingdom to consume itself and turned westward . During the wars of Demetrius Nicator and Zabinas ( 629 A.U.C. , 125 B.c. ) , they began to move across the Alps ( 630 A.u.c. , 124 B.c . ) . Sextius , having defeated the Salian Gauls , established in the town of Aix ( ( - en- Provence a colony which still bears his name . The Gauls did not defend themselves well . Fabius subjugated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 123 B.c. ) , and in the same year in which Grypus made his mother drink the poison she had prepared for him ( 633 A.u.c. , 121 B.c . ) , Gallia Narbonensis , reduced to the size of a province , was made a Roman province . Thus the Roman Empire was growing , and gradually came to occupy all the lands and all the oceans of the known world . But though the aspect of the republic was made resplendent on the outside by these conquests , it was marred by the unbridled ambition of its citizens and its internal struggles . The most illustrious of the Romans became the most pernicious to the common weal . The two Gracchi , who fawned upon the people , created divisions which ended only with the end of the republic . Gaius , Tiberius ' brother , could not tolerate the thought that this great man had been killed in such a tragic way . Incited to vengeance by impulses that were believed to be inspired by the ghost of Tiberius , he armed all the citizens against one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he died a death similar to the one he had wanted to avenge . Money could buy anything in Rome . Jugurtha , king of Numidia ( 635-41 A.U.C. , 119-113 B.c. ) , tainted with the murder of his brothers , who had been under the protection of the Roman people , defended himself for a longer time by his liberalities than by armed force ; and Marius , who finally defeated him , could gain command only by inciting the people against the nobility ( 648 A.U.C. , 106 B.C. ) . There was a second uprising of the slaves in Sicily ( 651 A.U.C. , 103 B.C. ) , and their second revolt cost the Romans as much blood as the first . Marius defeated the Teutoni ( 652 A.U.C. , 102 B.c. ) , the Cimbri , and the other peoples of the north , who were invading Gaul , Spain , and Italy . His victories over them ( 654 A.U.C. , 100 B.C. ) once again furnished the occasion to propose distributions of land . Metellus , who was opposed to this , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94 B.C. ) , and it took the blood of the people 's tribune Saturninus to end the divisions . While Rome protected Cappadocia ( 666 A.U.C. , 88 B.C. ) against Mithradates , king of Pontus , and while this powerful enemy capitulated before the Roman forces ( 668 A.U.C. , 86 B.C. ) , as did Greece , which had taken his side , Italy , well trained by all the wars it had fought either against or for the Romans ( 663 A.U.C. , 91 B.C. ) , threatened their empire by a universal revolt . At the same time , Rome was torn by the furious struggle between Marius and Sulla ( 666 A.U.C. et seq. , 88-87 B.C. ) , one of whom had terrified the south and the north , while the other was the victor over Greece and Asia . Sulla ( 672 A.U.C. , 82 B.C. ) , who was called the Fortunate , was too // fortunate against his country , which he enslaved by his tyrannical dictatorship ( 675 A.U.C. , 79 B.c . ) . Even though he did relinquish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone wanted to rule . Sertorius , a zealous partisan of Marius , entrenched himself in Spain ( 680 A.u.c. , 74 B.c. ) and formed an alliance with Mithradates . Force was useless against this great captain , and Pompey found that the only way to bring this party to heel was to sow dissension within it ( 681 A.u.c. , 73 B.c . ) . Even a man like the gladiator Spartacus believed that he could aspire to the command . This slave caused the praetors and consuls as much difficulty ( 683 A.u.c. , 71 B.c. ) as Mithradates caused Lucullus . The war of the gladiators became dangerous to the Roman power . Crassus had difficulty in bringing it to an end , and it was necessary to dispatch the great Pompey against them . Lucullus now had the upper hand in the East . The Romans crossed the Euphrates ( 686 A.u.c. , 68 B.c. ) ; but their general , though invincible to the enemy , was unable to hold his own soldiers to their duty . Mithradates , often defeated without ever losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune of Pompey was needed to end this war . When he was sent against Mithradates , he had just rid the oceans of the pirates ( 687 A.U.C. , 67 B.c. ) who infested them from Syria to the Pillars of Hercules . His glory seemed to be at its pinnacle . He was indeed able to subjugate that valiant king ( 689 A.u.c. , 65 B.c. ) and to conquer Armenia , where he had taken refuge ; Iberia and Albania , which supported him ; Syria , which was torn by factions ( 691 A.U.C. , 63 B.c . ) ; Judaea , where the division among the Hasmonaeans left Hyrcanus II , son of Alexander Jannaeus , only a shadow of power ; in short , all of the East . Yet , it would have been impossible for him to triumph over all these enemies without the consul Cicero , who saved the city from the incendiary actions planned by Cataline and his followers , all members of the most illustrious nobility of Rome . This dangerous party was put down by the eloquence of Cicero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , G ( ( aius Antonius . But for all that , the liberty of the Roman people was not more secure . Pompey reigned in the senate , and his great name made him the absolute master in all debates . When Julius Caesar subjugated Gaul ( 696 A.U.C. et seq. , 58 B.C. et seq. ) , he gave his country the most useful conquest it had ever made . A service of such importance enabled him to establish his supremacy in his own country . It was his desire first to equal , and then to surpass , Pompey . The immense wealth of Crassus led him to believe that he could share the glory of these two great men , as he shared their authority . He boldly undertook the war against the Parthians ( 700 A.U.C. , 54 B.c. ) , which was disastrous for him and for his country . The victorious Arsacidae ( 701 A.U.C. , 53 B.c. ) insulted the ambition of the Romans and the insatiable greed of their general with cruel jests . But shame upon the Roman name was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had counterbalanced that of Pompey and Caesar , whom he had thus kept united against their will . His death ( 705 A.U.C. , 49 B.c. ) broke the dike that held them back . The two rivals , who held in their hands all the power of the republic , decided their quarrel at Pharsalus in one savage battle ( 706 A.U.C. , 48 B.c . ) . Caesar won that battle , and in a moment he appeared everywhere in the world : in Egypt , in Asia ( 707 A.U.C. , 47 B.C. ) , in Mauretania ( 708 A.U.C. , 46 B.c. ) , and in Spain ( 709 A.U.C. , 45 B.C. ) . Victorious on all fronts , he was recognized as master in Rome ( 710 A.U.C. , 44 B.C. ) and throughout the empire . Brutus and Cassius felt they were liberating their fellow citizens when they killed him as a tyrant ( 711 A.U.C. , 43 B.C. ) , despite his leniency . Rome now fell ( 712 A.U.C. , 42 B.C. ) into the hands of Mark Antony ( ( Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Julius Caesar and his adopted son , three intolerable tyrants whose triumvirate and proscriptions still make us shudder when we read about them . But they were too violent to last long . These three men divided up the empire . Caesar ( ( Octavianus retained Italy and , immediately changing his erstwhile cruelty into kindness , pretended that he had been swept along against his will by his colleagues ( 718 A.U.C. , 36 B.c . ) . The remainder of the republic perished with Brutus and Cassius . Having eliminated Lepidus ( 722 A.U.C. , 32 B.C. ) , Caesar and Antony turned against each other . All the power of Rome clashed on the sea . Caesar won the Battle of Actium ( 723 A.U.C. , 31 B.c . ) . The forces of Egypt and the East , which Antony had on his side , were // dispersed . He was forsaken by all his friends , even his Cleopatra , for whom he had ruined himself . Herod ( ( the Great , the Idumaean , who owed him everything , was forced to surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was thereby able to hold on to the kingdom of Judah , which had been entirely lost to the Hasmonaeans by the weakness of old Hyrcanus . Everything gave way before Caesar 's good luck . Alexandria opened its gates to him , and Egypt became a Roman province . Cleopatra , losing all hope of being able to keep it , killed herself after Antony 's suicide . Rome received Caesar with open arms ( 727 A.U.C. , 27 B.C. ) , and , under the name of Augustus and the title of emperor , he established himself permanently as the sole master of the B.c . ) ; Ethiopia sued for peace ( 732 A.U.C. , 22 B.c. ) ; terrified , the Parthians sent back to him the standards that had been taken from Crassus , as well as all the Roman prisoners ( 734 A.U.C. , 20 B.c . ) ; India sought an alliance with him ( 739 A.U.C. , 15 B.c. ) ; his strength was felt by the Rhaetians or Grisons , whose mountains were no longer a defense ( 742 A.u.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared him ( 747 A.u.c. , 7 B.c. ) , and the Turk received his laws . Victorious on land and sea , he closed the Temple of Janus ( 753 A.U.C. , 1 B.c . ) . The universe lived in peace under his power , and Jesus Christ came into the world ( 754 A.U.c . ) . Tenth Epoch THE BIRTH OF JESUS CHRIST Seventh andLastAge of the World Thus , we have finally come to the age so ardently desired by our forefathers , that of the coming of the Messiah ( A.D. 1 ) . This name signifies the Christ , or the Anointed of the Lord , and it is due Jesus Christ as priest , king , and prophet . There are differences of opinion as to the precise year in which he came into the world , and it is generally agreed that in reality his birth falls some years before our traditional era . Yet , for greater convenience , we shall go along with everyone else . Without entering any further into the discussion as to the precise year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it occurred about the year 4000 from the beginning of the world . Some place it a little earlier , some a little later , and others into precisely that year . This discrepancy is as much the result of uncertainty concerning the years of the world as concerning the birth of Our Lord . Be that as it may , it was about that time , 1000 years after the consecration of the Temple , and the year 754 of Rome , that Jesus Christ , the son of God in eternity and the son of Abraham and David in time , was born of a virgin . This epoch is the most noteworthy of all , not only because of the importance of this great event , but also because Christians began several centuries ago to count their years from that date . It should also be noted that it roughly coincides with the time Rome returned to the monarchic state under the peaceful rule of Augustus . All the arts flourished in his day , and Latin poetry was brought to its supreme perfection by Virgil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his liberality , but also by giving them free access to his person . The birth of Jesus Christ was followed closely by the death of Herod ( A.D. 8 ) . His kingdom was divided among his children , and the largest share soon fell into the hands of the Romans . Augustus ' reign ended in great glory . Tiberius , whom he had adopted , succeeded him unopposed , and the empire was recognized as hereditary in the family of the Caesars . Rome suffered greatly under the cruel rule of Tiberius , but the rest of the empire was rather quiet . Tiberius ' nephew , Germanicus , appeased the rebellious army , refused to become emperor , defeated the indomitable Arminius ( A.D. 14 ) , and took his conquering army as far as the Elbe ( A.D. 16 ) . Since the affection of all these peoples had brought him the jealousy of his uncle , this barbarian caused him to die ( A.D. 17 ) , either from sorrow or from poison . In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ was baptized by this divine precursor , and the eternal Father recognized his beloved Son in a voice coming from on high . The Holy Spirit descended upon the Savior in // the peaceful figure of a dove : thus the whole Trinity became manifest . Here was the beginning of the seventieth week of Daniel and of the preaching of Jesus Christ . This last week was the most important and the most explicit . Daniel had set it apart from the others as the week in which the Covenant was to be confirmed and in which the ancient sacrifices were to lose their effectiveness . We may call it the week of mysteries . In it , Jesus Christ established his mission and his doctrine by innumerable miracles and , in the end , by his death . The latter occurred in the fourth year of his ministry ( A.D. 30 ) , which was also the fourth year of the last week of Daniel ; so that this great week is exactly cut in half by that death . Thus , a reckoning of the weeks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for us . We have only to add to the 453 years ( from the year 300 of Rome and the twentieth year of Artaxerxes until the beginning of our traditional era ) the 30 years of that era which end with the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius and the baptism of Our Lord , and the two sums will add up to 483 years . Of the 7 years lacking to make 490 , the fourth , which occupies the middle , is that in which Jesus Christ died , so that all of Daniel 's prophecies are visibly enclosed in the space of time he had allotted It would not even be necessary that everything should fit in so neatly , and there is no reason to accept the middle indicated by Daniel with such extreme rigidity . The most careful scholars would be content to find that point anywhere between the two extremes . I say this so that those who would like to place the beginning of the reign of Artaxerxes or the death of Our Lord somewhat earlier or somewhat later should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try to obfuscate a clear thing by quibbles over chronology will desist from their useless subtleties . This much one must know if one is not to be confused by secular authors and if one is to understand as much of Hebrew history as one needs . Further discussions of chronology are of very little use here . Whether the birth of Our Lord must be placed a little earlier or a little later , and whether his later life must be made a little longer or a little shorter is a diversity of opinion that arises as much from our uncertainty as to the years of the world as to those of Jesus Christ . And however that may be , an attentive reader will already be in a position to know that this has no influence on either the continuity or the accomplishment of God 's decrees . We must avoid those anachronisms which confuse the order of events and leave the others to be debated by the scholars . As for those who insist upon finding in secular history the miracles of Jesus Christ and his disciples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , on the contrary , opposed with all its might as something which condemned its ways , we shall speak of their error elsewhere . We shall also see that there are more truths favorable to Christianity in secular authors than one would believe . The only example I shall mention here is the eclipse that occurred at the Crucifixion of Our Lord . The darkness covering all the face of the earth at high noon and at the moment when Jesus Christ was crucified , was taken for an ordinary eclipse by the pagan authors who recorded this memorable event . But the first Christians , who spoke about it to the Romans as of a miracle mentioned not ony by their authors but also in their public records , have proven that neither at the time of the full moon , when Jesus Christ died , nor in the entire year when that eclipse was observed could an eclipse have occurred without supernatural causes . We have the exact words of Phlegon , a freedman of Hadrian , which were quoted at a time when his book was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history by Thallus , who followed him . The fourth year of the 202nd olympiad , singled out in the annals of Phlegon , is unquestionably the year of the death of Our Lord . In a crowning mystery , Jesus Christ leaves the tomb on the third day ; appears to his disciples ; rises to heaven in their presence ; sends them the Holy Spirit ; the Church is founded ; persecution begins ; St. Stephen is stoned ; and St. Paul is converted . Shortly thereafter , Tiberius dies ( A.D. 37 ) . Caligula , his greatnephew , adopted son , and successor , astounds the world with his cruel and brutal madness : he has himself worshiped as a god and orders his statue to be placed in the Temple of Jerusalem ( A.D. 40 ) . Chaerea delivers the world from this monster . Next , Claudius reigns , despite his stupidity ( A.D. 41 ) . He is dishonored by his wife , Messalina ( A.D.41 ) , whom he wanted to have back after having had // her killed . His next wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The apostles hold the Council of Jerusalem ( A.D. 50 ) , where St. Peter is the first to speak , as always and everywhere . In this council , converted Gentiles are exempted from the ceremonies of the ( ( Mosaic Law . This judgment is pronounced in the name of the Holy Spirit and of the Church . St. Paul and St. Barnabas take the council 's decree to the churches and instruct the faithful to submit to it . Such was the form of the first council . In his stupidity , the emperor disinherited his son Britannicus and adopted Nero , Agrippina 's son ( A.D. 54 ) . She rewarded this overly complaisant husband by poisoning him . But her son 's rule was as disastrous for her as for the rest of the republic . What honor there was in this reign went to Corbulo for his victories over the Parthians and the Armenians ( A.D. 58 ) . At this time Nero began the war against the Jews ( A.D. 66 ) and the persecution of the Christians . He was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death St. Peter and St. Paul ( A.D. 67 ) . But since at the same time he was persecuting the entire human race , there was rebellion against him on all sides ( A.D. 68 ) . When he learned that the senate had condemned him , he killed himself ( A.D. 69 ) . Now every army set up its own emperor . The conflict was decided near Rome , and within Rome itself , in a series of dreadful battles . Galba , Otho , and Vitellius perished in these battles . The afflicted empire found rest under Vespasian ( A.D. 70 ) . But the Jews were in dire straits , and Jerusalem was taken and burned to the ground . Titus , the son and successor of Vespasian , gave the world a short-lived happiness ( A.D. 79 ) . His days , which he counted as wasted unless they were marked by some good deed , were ended too soon . Another Nero appeared in the person of Domitian . There was a new persecution . St. John , unharmed by immersion in boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island of Patmos , where he wrote his Gospel ( A.D. 95 ) , thus adding the title of evangelist to that of apostle and prophet . From this time on , the Christians were constantly persecuted , under good as well as bad emperors . Sometimes these persecutions took place on orders from the emperor or because of a specific grudge of the magistrates , sometimes because of a popular uprising , and sometimes following a decree duly handed down by the senate upon instructions from the prince or in his presence . In these instances the persecution was the most widespread and the most bloodthirsty . Thus the hatred of the unbelievers , though always bent on destroying the Church , periodically worked itself up to a new pitch of fury . Church historians count these periodic outbreaks of violence as ten persecutions under ten emperors . Such prolonged suffering never led the Christians to revolt in any way . Of all the faithful , the bishops were always under the most severe attacks . Of all the churches , the Church of Rome was persecuted with the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gospel they preached to the whole world . Domitian was killed ( A.D. 96 ) , and the empire began to breathe under Nerva . His advanced age did not permit him to restore the empire ; but in order to ensure lasting public tranquillity , he chose Trajan as his successor ( A.D. 97 ) . Quiet at home and triumphant abroad ( A.D. 98 ) , the empire never ceased to admire this excellent prince . This was because it was his maxim that his citizens should find him such as he should wish to find the emperor if he were a simple citizen . He subjugated the Dacians and their king Decebalus ( A.D. 102 ) , extended his conquests in the East ( A.D. 106 ) , and gave a king to the Parthians ( A.D. 115 ) and made them fear the power of Rome ( A.D. 116 ) . How fortunate that drunkenness and his disgraceful love affairs , deplorable vices in a great prince , did not lead him to pervert justice ! These fortunate times for the republic ( A.D. 117 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and bad ( A.D. 120-26 ) . This prince maintained military discipline and himself lived a military life of great frugality . He eased the lot of the provinces and supported the arts , as well as Greece , their mother . The barbarians were kept in check by his military power and his authority ( A.D. 130 ) : He rebuilt Jerusalem and gave it his name , whence it came to be called Aelia . But he banished the Jews from Jerusalem , who were perpetually rebellious to the empire ( A.D. 135 ) . This obdurate people found a pitiless avenger in his person . He dishonored his brilliant // reign by his cruelty and his unnatural love life ( A.D. 131 ) . His infamous Antinous , whom he made into a god , casts shame upon his entire life . The emperor seemed to mend his ways and to restore his tarnished glory when he adopted Antoninus Pius ( A.D. 138 ) , who , in turn , adopted Marcus Aurelius , the sage and philosopher . In these two princes we see two fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 139 ) , is always ready to go to war if the need arises . The son , always at war ( A.D. 161 ) , is always ready to grant peace to his adversaries and to the empire . His father , Antoninus , had taught him that it was better to save a single citizen than to defeat a thousand enemies ( A.D. 162 ) . The measure of Marcus Aurelius was felt by the Parthians and the Marcomanni ( A.D. 169 ) , the latter being a Germanic tribe whom the emperor brought to submission just ' E- ' ' before his death ( A.D. 180 ) . The worth of the two Antoninuses made that name the delight of the Romans . The glory of that great name was effaced neither by the effeminacy of Lucius Verus , brother of Marcus Aurelius and his coemperor , nor by the brutality of Commodus , his son and successor . The latter , unworthy of such a father , forgot his teachings and his example . The senate and the people detested him ; and finally his most assiduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor , Pertinax ( A.D. 192 ) , a vigorous defender of military discipline , was sacrificed to the fury of the licentious soldiery ( A.D. 193 ) , which , shortly before , had elevated him to the supreme power against his will . The empire , which the army put up for sale to the highest bidder , found a buyer . The jurisconsult Didius Julianus took his chance in these brazen dealings ( A.D. 194 etc. ) ; it cost him his life . Severus , horn in Africa , put him to death , avenged Pertinax 's death , and , passing from East to West , triumphed in Syria , Gaul , and Great Britain . A swift conqueror ( A.D. 207 ) , he equaled Caesar in his victories but did not imitate his leniency . He was unable to make peace among his children . Immediately after his death ( A.D. 211 ) , Bassianus or Caracalla , his eldest son and a would-be Alexander , killed his brother and coemperor Geta ( A.D. 212 ) in the arms of Julia , their common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought a tragic death upon himself . Severus had won him the hearts of the soldiers and the people by calling him Antoninus , but he could not sustain the glory of that name . The Syrian Heliogabalus , or rather Elagabalus his son ( A.D. 218 ) ( or so he was reputed to be , although the name Antoninus would have given him first the hearts of the soldiery and then a victory over Macrinus ) , very soon became the horror of mankind through his shameful actions , and brought destruction upon himself . His relative and successor , Alexander Severus ( A.D. 222 ) , Mamaea 's son , did not live long enough for the good of the world . He complained that it was more difficult for him to control his soldiers than to defeat his enemies . His mother , who directed him , was the cause of his downfall as she had been the cause of his glory ( A.D. 233 ) . Under his reign , Artaxerxes of Persia killed Artabanus ( A.D. 235 ) , the last king of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East . In these times , the nascent Church spread out over all the earth , and not only in the East , where its origins were ? that is , in Palestine , Syria , Egypt , Asia Minor , and Greece ? but also in the West beyond Italy , in the various regions of Gaul , all the provinces of Spain , Africa , Germany , and places in Great Britain that were impenetrable to the Roman armies . It also spread outside the empire , in Armenia , Persia , India , and among the most barbaric peoples , such as the Sarmatae , the Dacians , the Scythians , the Moors , the Getae , and even to completely unknown islands . The blood of its martyrs made the Church fruitful ( A.D. 107 ) . Under Trajan , St. Ignatius , bishop of Antioch , was thrown to the wild beasts . Marcus Aurelius , unfortunately convinced by the calumnies leveled at the Christians ( A.D. 163 ) , put to death St. Justin , the philosopher and apologist of Christianity . St. Polycarp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was condemned to the stake at the age of eighty under the same prince ( A.D. 167 ) . The holy martyrs of Lyons and Vienne suffered unspeakable torments ( A.D. 177 ) , following the example of their bishop , Pothinus , who was ninety years old . The Gallican church **27;67; filled the whole world with its glory . St. Irenaeus , a disciple of St. Polycarp and the successor of St. Pothinus , followed in his predecessor 's footsteps and died a martyr under Severus , together with a great number of the faithful of his church ( A.D. 202 ) . // At times the persecution abated somewhat ( A.D. 174 ) . When Marcus Aurelius suffered an extreme shortage of water in Germany , a Christian legion obtained a rain capable of quenching the army 's thirst , accompanied by thunderclaps that spread terror among the enemy . This miracle gave the legion the name of Lightning Bolt , or confirmed it . The emperor was moved by this and wrote to the senate in favor of the Christians . In the end , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prayers a miracle which the pagans did not even think of desiring . Other causes as well sometimes temporarily stayed or mitigated the persecution . But superstition , a vice which even Marcus Aurelius could not eschew , popular hatred , and the calumnies leveled at the Christians soon won out . The pagans ' anger was rekindled and the entire empire was drenched with martyrs ' blood . Doctrine went hand in hand with suffering . Under Severus ( A.D. 215 ) and for a short time after him , Tertullian , a Carthaginian priest , enlightened the Church with his writings , defended it in his admirable Apologeticus , and finally left it , blinded by his uncompromising pride and led astray by the visions of the false prophet Montanus . About the same time the saintly priest Clement of Alexandria unearthed the antiquities of paganism in order to refute it . Origen , son of the holy martyr Leonidas , became famous in the entire Church at a very young age and taught great truths , interspersed with many errors . The philosopher Ammonius made Platonic philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagans . Meanwhile , the Valentinians , the Gnostics , and other impious sects opposed false traditions to the Gospel . Against them , St. Irenaeus upheld the tradition and the authority of the apostolic churches , especially that of Rome , which was founded by St. Peter and St. Paul and is the foremost of them all . This was also done by Tertullian . The Church stood firm , despite heresies , schisms , and the fall of its most illustrious doctors . The purity of its ways was so striking that it was praised even by its enemies . The affairs of the empire were becoming embroiled in the most dreadful way . After Alexander 's death ( A.D. 235 ) , the tyrant Maximinus , who had killed him , seized power , although he was of Gothic descent . The senate opposed him with four emperors , all of whom perished in less than two years ( A.D. 236-38 ) . Among them were the two Gordians , father and son , beloved by the Roman people . Although the young Gordian , their son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 242 ) , he had the greatest difficulty in defending the empire , weakened as it was by all these divisions , against the Persians . He had regained many important places from them . But Philip the Arab ( ( Marcus Julius Philippus killed this excellent prince . He , fearful of being overcome by two emperors ( A.D. 244 ) , whom the senate had successively elected , concluded an ignominious peace with Shapur ( A.D. 245 ) , king of Persia . He was the first Roman to give up any territory of the empire by treaty . He is said to have embraced the Christian religion at a time when he suddenly seemed an improved person , and it is true that he did favor the Christians ( A.D. 249 ) . Out of hatred for this emperor , Decius , who killed him , instigated a new persecution , which was more violent than all the others . The Church was spreading everywhere , particularly in Gaul ; and the empire soon lost Decius , who defended it vigorously ( A.D. 251 ) . The reigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 254 ) , and Aemilianus was no more than a passing figure . Finally , the sovereign power was given to Valerianus , and this venerable old man ascended to it by way of all the offices ( A.D. 257 ) . He was cruel only to the Christians . Under him Pope St. Stephen and St. Cyprian , bishop of Carthage ( A.D. 258 ) , despite all of their disputes , which had not broken the Christian community , both received the same crown . The error of St. Cyprian ( A.D. 259 ) , who rejected baptism administered by heretics , harmed neither him nor the Church . The tradition of the Holy See prevailed by its own strength against the specious arguments and the authority of this great man , even though other great men also defended his doctrine . Another dispute was more harmful ( A.D. 257 ) : Sabellius merged the three persons of the Trinity and saw God as only one person under three names . This new interpretation astounded the Church , and St. Dionysius , bishop of Alexandria ( A.D. 259 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heresiarch . This saintly pope suffered his martyrdom soon after his predecessor , St. Stephen . His head was severed ; and he left his deacon , St. Lawrence , to endure even greater suffering . // At this time we see the beginning of the influx of barbarians . The Burgundians and other Germanic tribes ( A.D. 258-60 ) , the Goths ( formerly called Getae ) , and other peoples living around the Black Sea and beyond the Danube came into Europe . The East also was invaded by the Asiatic Scythians and the Persians . The latter defeated Valerianus and later captured him by treason . Having permitted him to live out his life in painful bondage , they skinned him and used his torn skin as a monument to their victory ( A.D. 261 ) . Gallienus , his son and coemperor , precipitated the final and complete ruin of the empire by his effeminacy . The empire was divided among thirty tyrants . The most illustrious among them was Odaenathus , king of Palmyra ( A.D. 264 ) , the ancient city founded by Solomon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barbarians and was recognized there . His wife , Zenobia , marched with him at the head of the armies , which she commanded alone after his death . She became famous throughout the world for having added chastity to beauty and knowledge to valor ( A.D. 268 ) . Claudius II , and Aurelianus after him , restored the affairs of the empire . While they gained resounding victories over the Goths as well as the Germans ( A.D. 270 ) , Zenobia preserved for her children their father 's conquests . This princess was leaning toward Judaism . In order to win her over , Paul of Samosata , bishop of Antioch , a vain and insecure man , expounded his Judaic opinion on the person of Jesus Christ , whom he considered to be purely a man . Having long dissimulated this novel doctrine , he was eventually convicted and condemned at the Council of Antioch ( A.D. 273 ) . Queen Zenobia continued the war against Aurelianus ( A.D. 274 ) , who was not above triumphing over so famous a woman . Constantly embattled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiery and showed that , by adhering to the traditional rules and the traditional frugality , it was possible to move great armies inside and outside the country without burdening the empire . Now the Franks were beginning to make themselves feared . They were a league of Germanic tribes living along the Rhine . Their name indicates that they were united by their love of liberty . Aurelianus had defeated them when he was a simple general , and he kept them in fear when he was emperor . Such a prince made himself hated by his bloodthirsty actions . His wrath was so terrible that it caused his death ( A.D. 275 ) . Those who believed themselves in danger wished to forestall him ; and his secretary , who was threatened , became the head of a conspiracy . The army saw him perish following the conspiracy of so many chiefs . It refused to elect an emperor lest one of Aurelianus ' assassins be put on the throne , and the senate , reinstated in its ancient rights , elected Tacitus . This new prince was venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence of one of his relatives , to whom he gave the command of the army , made him hateful ; and he perished with him in a revolt in the sixth month of his reign ( A.D. 276 ) . Thus , his elevation only hastened the course of h ; s life . His brother Florianus claimed the empire by right of succession , as the closest heir . This right was not recognized , and Florianus was killed . Probus was forced by the soldiers to accept the title of emperor , even though he threatened to impose order . Everything gave way before this great captain ( A.D. 277 ) . The Germans and the Franks , who wanted to enter Gaul , were repulsed ( A.D. 278 ) ; and in the East as well as in the West all the barbarians respected the power of Rome ( A.D. 280 ) . This redoutable warrior aspired to peace , and he gave the empire hopes of no longer needing the soldiery . The army took vengeance for this word and for the severe rules its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the violence it had perpetrated upon this great prince , the army honored his memory and named as his successor Carus , who was as strict a disciplinarian as he had been ( A.D. 283 ) . This valiant prince avenged his predecessor and repulsed the barbarians , to whom the death of Probus had given new courage . He marched to the East with his second son , Numerianus , in order to combat the Persians ; and to his enemies to the north he opposed his eldest son , Carinus , whom he named Caesar . This was the second dignity , and the closest step before reaching the dignity of emperor . All of the East was terrified by Carus . Mesopotamia submitted , and the Persians , being divided , were unable to resist him . While everything was giving way before him , the heavens halted his course with a bolt of lightning . Numerianus wept so much that he almost lost his eyes . But what will not lust for power do to a human heart ! Far from pitying his suffering , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenged this death ( A.D. 284 ) and finally attained the dignity of emperor which he had sought with such ardor . Carinus awakened , despite his effeminacy , and defeated Diocletian ( A.D. 285 ) . But while he was pursuing the fleeing soldiers , he was killed by one of his own men whose wife he had corrupted . Thus the empire was rid of the most violent and debauched of men . Diocletian governed with vigor but with intolerable vanity . In order to resist the many enemies who rose up on all sides at home and abroad , he named Maximianus coemperor ( A.D. 286 ) , but he was able to preempt the principal authority . Each of the emperors created a caesar . Constantius Chlorus and Galerius were elevated to that high rank ( A.D. 291 ) . The four princes found the numerous wars a very heavy burden . Diocletian fled Rome , finding it too liberal , and established himself at Nicomedia , where he had himself worshiped after the manner of the people of the East . Meanwhile the Persians were defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entire kingdoms to the Romans . After these successful exploits , Galerius rebelled and scorned the name of caesar . He began by intimidating Maximianus . A long illness had broken Diocletian 's spirit , and Galerius , though his son-in-law , forced him to give up the emperorship . Maximianus was made to follow his example . Thus the empire fell into the hands of Constantius Chlorus and Galerius ( A.D. 304 ) , and two new caesars , Severus and Maximinus , were created in their stead by the outgoing emperors . Gaul , Spain , and Great Britain were happy , though for too short a time , under Constantius Chlorus . Opposed to levies , and therefore accused of ruining the public finances , he proved that he had immense treasures in the goodwill of his subjects . The rest of the empire suffered greatly under so many emperors and so many caesars . The number of officeholders increased with that of princes , and there were infinite expenses and levies . Young Constantine , the son of Constantius Chlorus , distinguished himself , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glory , that emperor exposed him to new dangers every day . He was made to fight wild beasts in a kind of game , but Galerius was to be feared as much as they . When Constantine escaped from his power , he found his father at the point of death . At this time ( A.D. 306 ) Maxentius , son of Maximianus and son-in-law of Galerius , crowned himself emperor in Rome against the will of his father-in-law , and internal division was added to the other ills of the state . When the image of Constantine , who had just succeeded his father , was brought to Rome , as was the custom , it was denied entry by orders of Maxentius . The reception of their images was the usual form of recognizing new princes . War was prepared on both sides . When Galerius dispatched the caesar Severus against him in Rome , Maxentius trembled in fear ( A.D. 307 ) . In order to alleviate his anxiety , he recalled his father Maximianus . The ambitious old man left his retreat , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to make Diocletian , his coemperor , leave the garden he was cultivating at Salona . Hearing that Maximianus had become emperor for the second time , Severus ' soldiers deserted him . The old emperor had him put to death ; and at the same time , in order to strengthen himself against Galerius , he gave Constantine his daughter Fausta . Galerius also needed support after Severus ' death , and that is the reason why he named Licinius emperor . But this choice angered Maximinus , who , with his title of caesar , believed himself closer to the supreme honor . Nothing could persuade him to submit to Licinius , and he set up his own empire in the East . Galerius was left with almost nothing but Illyricum , where he had retired after he was expelled from Italy . The rest of the East was obedient to Maximianus , his son Maxentius , and his son-in-law Constantine . But Maximianus did not want to share his emperorship with his children any more than with strangers . He tried to expel his son Maxentius from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received him in Gaul , found him equally perfidious . After a number of attempts , Maximianus instigated a final conspiracy , in which he thought he had involved his daughter Fausta against her husband . She was deceiving him ; and Maximianus , who thought he had killed Constantine when he killed the eunuch who had been placed in his bed , was forced to kill himself . A new war flared up , and Maxentius used the pretext of avenging his father to declare himself against Constantine ( A.D. 312 ) , who was marching on Rome with his troops . At the same time , he caused the statues of Maximianus to be // overthrown ; and those of Diocletian , which stood with them , suffered the same fate . The tranquillity of Diocletian was disturbed by such scorn , and he died shortly thereafter , from sorrow as much as from old age . In these times , Rome , still hostile to Christianity , made a last effort to smother it but , in the end , established it definitively . Two years before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considered by historians to be the author of the last persecution , obliged him to hand down that bloodthirsty edict which ordered the Romans to persecute the Christians with more violence than ever . Maximianus , who hated them and had never ceased to torment them , spurred the magistrates and executioners into action . But his violence , extreme as it was , was in no way equal to that of Maximianus and Galerius . New tortures were invented every day . The modesty of Christian virgins was attacked as much as their faith . The sacred books were searched out with the most extraordinary care , in order to extinguish the very memory of them , and Christians did not dare have them in their houses and almost dared not read them . Thus , after 300 years of persecution , the hatred of the persecutors became even more ruthless . The Christians exasperated them by their patience . Other nations , impressed by their saintly way of life , converted in great numbers . Galerius lost all hope of vanquishing them . Stricken by a very unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and died the death of Antiochus , doing penance in the same insincere manner . Maximinus continued the persecution . But Constantine the Great , a wise and victorious prince , publicly converted to Christianity ( A.D. 312 ) . Eleventh Epoch CONSTANTINE , OR THE PEACE OF THE CHURCH This famous declaration of Constantine was made in the year of Our Lord 312 . While he was besieging Maxentius in Rome , a cross of light appeared to him in the air in the presence of all the people with an inscription promising him victory ; and the same thing was confirmed to him in a dream . On the next day he won that famous battle which rid Rome of a tyrant and the Church of a persecutor ( A.D. 313 ) . The Cross was exhibited as the defense of Rome and of all the empire . Shortly thereafter , Maximinus was defeated by Licinius , who was of one mind with Constantine ; and his end was similar to that of Galerius . Peace was given to the Church . Constantine overwhelmed it with honors . Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repulsed by him as well as by his children . Meanwhile , Licinius fell out with him ( A.D. 315 ) and renewed the persecution . Defeated on land and sea ( A.D. 324 ) , he was constrained to leave the empire and finally to lose his life . In this time Constantine assembled in the Bithynian city of Nicaea the first ecumenical council ( A.D. 325 ) , in which 318 bishops , representing all the Church , condemned the priest Arius , who denied the divinity of the Son of God , and created the symbol establishing the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son . The priests of the Roman church , dispatched by Pope St. Sylvester , took precedence over all the bishops in that assembly , and an ancient Greek author includes among the envoys of the Holy See the famous Hosius , bishop of Cordoba , who presided over the council . Constantine attended the session and accepted its decisions as an oracle from Heaven . The Arians concealed their heretical ways and regained his favor by dissimulation . While his valor was maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family was disturbed by the wiles of his wife , Fausta ( A.D. 326 ) . Crispus , Constantine 's son by a previous marriage , found his father inexorable when he was accused by his stepmother of trying to corrupt her . His death was soon avenged : Fausta , convicted of her crime , was smothered in her bath . Constantine , though dishonored by the evildoing of his wife , at the same time derived great honor from the piety of his mother . She discovered , in the ruins of old Jerusalem , the True Cross , which is rich in miracles . The Holy Sepulcher was also found . The new city of Jerusalem , built by Hadrian , the grotto in which the Savior of th , world was born , and all the holy places were adorned with superb temples by Helena and Constantine . Four years later ( A.D. 330 ) the // emperor rebuilt Byzantium , calling it Constantinople and making it the second capital of the empire . The Church , peaceful under Constantine , was cruelly afflicted in Persia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their faith . In vain the emperor tried to appease Shapur and to win him over to Christianity . The emperor 's protection could offer the persecuted Christians nothing more than a secure retreat . This prince , blessed . by all the Church , died full of joy and hope ( A.D. 337 ) , having divided the empire among his three sons , Constantine , Constans , and Constantius . Their harmony was soon broken . Constantine perished ( A.D. 340 ) in a war with his brother Constantius over the limits of their empire . Nor were Constans and Constantius more united . Constans upheld the Nicene Creed , which Constantius opposed . At that time the Church admired the long suffering of St. Athanasius , patriarch of Alexandria and a defender of the Council of Nicaea . Deposed by Constantius ( A.D. 341 ) , he was canonically reinstated by Pope St. Julius I , whose decree was backed by Constans . This good prince did not last long . The tyrant Magnentius killed him through treason ( A.D. 350 ) ; but shortly thereafter Magnentius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In the battle which ruined him ( A.D. 353 ) , Valens , an Arian bishop who had secretly received word from his friends , assured Constantius that the tyrant 's army was routed and told the weak emperor that he knew this by revelation . On the basis of that false revelation , Constantius went over to the Arians . The orthodox bishops were deposed , and all the Church suffered confusion and discord . The steadfastness of Pope Liberius broke down under the tedium of exile ( A.D. 357-59 ) , and the old Hosius , formerly a pillar of the Church , succumbed under torture . The Council of Rimini , so firm in the beginning , finally bent to subterfuge and violence . Nothing was done in the proper form , and the emperor 's authority was the only law ; but the Arians , who achieved everything by such means , were unable to agree among themselves and changed their symbol every day . Thus the Nicene Creed remained in vigor , and its principal defenders , St. Athanasius and St. Hilarius , bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Constantius , occupied as he was with matters relating to Arianism , neglected the affairs of the empire , the Persians made great inroads . The Germans and the Franks tried to enter Gaul from all sides . Julian , a relative of the emperor , halted and defeated them . The emperor himself defeated the Sarmatae and marched against the Persians ( A.D. 360 ) . Here we see Julian 's revolt against the emperor , his apostasy ( A.D. 361 ) , the death of Constantius , the reign of Julian , his just rule , and the new kind of persecution to which he subjected the Church . He fanned the discord within the Church and excluded Christians not only from public office but also from study . Imitating the saintly discipline of the Church , he hoped to defeat it with its own weapons . Punishment was used sparingly and was meted out under different pretexts than religion . The Christians remained faithful to their emperor ; but his excessive thirst for glory brought his downfall ( A.D. 363 ) . He was killed in Persia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successor , a zealous Christian , found the situation desperate and lived only long enough to conclude an ignominious peace . After him , Valentinian conducted the war in the manner of a great captain ( A.D. 364 ) . He took his son Gratian on his expeditions from his earliest youth on ( A.D. 366 et seq. ) , maintained military discipline , defeated the barbarians , fortified the frontiers of the empire , and protected the Nicene Creed in the West . His brother Valens , whom he had made coemperor , persecuted it in the East ; but , unable to win over or crush St. Basil and St. Gregory of Nazianzus , he gave up all hope of overcoming it . Some of the Arians added new errors to the old dogmas of the sect . Aerius , an Arian priest , is known in the writings of the Church Fathers as the author of a new heresy , for having held that priests and bishops are of equal rank and for having judged useless the prayers and oblations the Church offered for the dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligations of the **10;96; Law certain prescribed fasts and to postulate that fasting be always voluntary . He was still living when St. Epiphanius became famous for his history of the heresies ( ( the Panarion , in which he is refuted along with all ) the others . St. Martin became bishop of Tours ( A.D. 375 ) , and tht reports of his saintliness and his miracles filled the world during his // life and after his death . Valentinian died after making a violent harangue to the enemies of the empire ; the impetuous temper for which he was feared by others was fatal to himself . His successor , Gratian , saw without envy the elevation of his young brother Valentinian II , who was made emperor even though he was only nine years old . His mother , Justina , who protected the Arians , was regent during his minority . Astonishing events take place in the space of a few years . The Goths rebel against Valens ( A.D. 377 ) , and this prince turns his efforts from the Persians to putting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just won a distinguished victory over the Germans , comes to his aid . But Valens , who wants to be the only victor , precipitates the battle in which he is killed near Adrianople : the victorious Goths burn him in a village to which he had retreated . Gratian , overwhelmed by administrative duties , makes the great Theodosius coemperor and leaves the East to him ( A.D. 379 ) . The Goths are defeated , and all the barbarians are kept in fear ; and , equally important to Theodosius , the Macedonian heretics , who had denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit , are condemned at the Council of Constantinople ( A.D. 381 ) . Only the Greek church was present at this council , but since it had the consent of all the West and of Pope St. Damasus , it was called the second ecumenical council . While Theodosius ruled with such firmness and success , Gratian , no less forceful or pious than he , was deserted by his troops , all of which were made up of foreigners , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Church and the empire mourned this good prince . The tyrant reigned in Gaul ( A.D. 386 ) and seemed content with his share . In her son 's name Empress Justina published edicts favoring Arianism . St. Ambrose , bishop of Milan , had nothing with which to oppose her but right doctrine , prayer , and patience ; and with these weapons he was able , not only to preserve for the Church the basilicas which the heretics wanted to occupy , but also to win over the young emperor . Meanwhile , Maximus was becoming restive , and Justina found out that no one served her more faithfully than the holy bishop whom she treated as a rebel . She sent him to the tyrant , who was unmoved by his words . Young Valentinian had to flee with his mother . Maximus made himself master of Rome , where he reestablished the sacrifices to the false gods in order to humor the senate , which was still almost entirely pagan . After Maximus had occupied all of the West ( A.D. 388 ) , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodosius , with the help of the Franks , defeated him in Pannonia , besieged him in Aquileia , and left him to be killed by his soldiers . Unopposed master of the two empires , Theodosius gave the Western part back to Valentinian , who did not keep it for long ( A.D. 392 ) . This young prince overly elevated and demeaned Arbogast , a Frankish captain , who was brave and disinterested but in a position to maintain the power he had acquired over the army by all manner of crime . He elevated the tyrant Eugenius , who knew only how to talk , and killed Valentinian , who no longer wanted to have the haughty Frank as his master . This detestable coup was perpetrated in Gaul , near Vienne . St. Ambrose , for whom the young emperor had sent , in order to be baptized by him , deplored his loss and hoped for his salvation . His death did not remain unpunished . A visible miracle gave Theodosius victory over Eugenius and over the false gods whose worship that tyrant had reestablished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to sacrifice him to public vengeance and to quell the rebellion by his death . The proud Arbogast preferred killing himself to asking for the clemency of the victor , which all the other rebels had received . Theodosius , ruling without a coemperor , was the joy and the admiration of the whole world . He was a support for religion , silenced the heretics , and abolished the impure sacrifices of the pagans . He also corrected indolence and did away with superfluous expenditures ( A.D. 390 ) . He humbly acknowledged his failings and did penance for them . He listened to St. Ambrose , the famous doctor of the Church , who reprimanded him for his temper , the only vice of this great prince . Always victorious , he went to war only when it was absolutely necessary . He gave his subjects happiness ; and when he died , he was more illustrious for his piety than for his victories . In his time , the priest St. Jerome , in his retreat at the sacred grotto of Bethlehem ( A.D. 386 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 387 ) . He read all of its exegetes , unearthed all // the sacred and secular histories apt to illuminate it , and , on the basis of the Hebrew original , composed the version of the Bible which all of the Church has accepted under the name of the Vulgate . The empire , seemingly invincible under Theodosius , suddenly changed under his two sons . Arcadius received the East , and Honorius the West . Both of them , directed by their ministers , made their power serve personal interests . Rufinus and Eutropius , the successive favorites of Arcadius ( A.D. 395 ) , who were both equally evil , soon perished ( A.D. 399 ) ; but for all that , things went no better under a weak prince . His wife Eudoxia induced him to persecute St. John Chrysostom ( A.D. 403 , 404 ) , the patriarch of Constantinople and luminary of the East . Pope St. Innocent and all of the West supported this great bishop against Theophilus , patriarch of Alexandria , who ministered to the violence of the empress . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pagan Goth , ravaged Italy . The Vandals , a Gothic and Arian tribe , occupied a part of Gaul and spread into Spain . Alaric , king of the Visigoths , who were also Arians , forced Honorius to cede him the great provinces already occupied by the Vandals . Stilicho , who was greatly disturbed by all these barbarians , defeated them , treated them leniently , came to an understanding with them , broke with them , sacrificed everything to his own interest , and yet preserved the empire he was planning to usurp . Meanwhile , Arcadius died ( A.D. 408 ) ; he had felt that the East was so lacking in loyal subjects that he put his eight-year-old son , Theodosius , under the tutelage of Yazdegerd , king of Persia . As it turned out , the young emperor 's sister , Pulcheria , was able to conduct the affairs of state . The empire of Theodosius was carried on by the prudence and piety of that princess . That of Honorius seemed close to ruin . He put Stilicho to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The revolt of Constantine , the complete loss of Gaul and Spain ( A.D. 409 ) , the occupation and sack of Rome by the armies of Alaric and the Visigoths ( A.D. 410 ) , all were the consequence of Stilicho 's death . Ataulphus , even more enraged than Alaric , sacked Rome once more , and his only thought was to abolish the very memory of Rome . It was the good fortune of the empire that he captured ( ( Galla Placidia , the emperor 's sister . This captive princess , whom he married , calmed him down . The Goths made a treaty with the Romans ( A.D. 413 ) and established themselves in Spain ( A.D. 414 ) , reserving for themselves the provinces of Gaul adjacent to the Pyrenees ( A.D. 415 ) . Their king , Wallia , laid these great plans wisely . Spain showed its constancy ; and its faith was not altered under the domination of these Arians . Meanwhile , the Burgundians , who were Germanic tribes , occupied the region around the Rhine , whence they gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Franks to be forgotten : firmly resolved to make a new effort to open up Gaul , they made Pharamund , the son of Marcomeres , their king ; and the monarchy of France , the most ancient and most noble of all the monarchies in the world , began under him ( A.D. 420 ) . The unfortunate Honorius died childless ( A.D. 423 ) and without making plans for the empire . Theodosius named as emperor his cousin Valentinian III ( A.D. 424 ) , the son of Placidia and her second husband Constantius , placing him , during his minority , under the tutelage of his mother , on whom he conferred the title of empress . In these times , Caelestius and Pelagius denied original sin ( A.D. 411 ) and the grace through which we are Christians ( A.D. 413 ) . Despite their dissimulations , the councils of Africa condemned them ( A.D. 416 ) . The Popes St. Innocent and St. Zosimus ( A.D. 417 ) , later followed by Pope St. Celestine , authorized this condemnation and made it known all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlightened the Church by his admirable writings . The same Church Father , seconded by his disciple St. Prosper , also silenced the semi-Pelagians , who attributed the beginning of justification and faith to the power of free will alone . A century that was so unfortunate for the empire , and in which so many heresies sprang up , was nevertheless a fortunate one for Christianity . No discord was able to shake it , no heresy to corrupt it . The Church , rich in great men , confounded all doctrinal errors . After the persecutions , it pleased God to show the glory of his martyrs for all the world to see : all the histories and all the writings of the time are full of the miracles that took place when their help was sought and their tombs were honored . Vigilantius ( A.D. 406 ) , // who opposed such widespread beliefs , was refuted by St. Jerome and found no following . The Christian faith became more and more secure and was spreading daily . But the Western empire was at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was further weakened by rivalries among its generals . The guile of Aetius ( A.D. 427 ) made Bonifacius , governor of Africa , suspect to Placidia . Unjustly treated in this manner , the governor called Gaiseric and the Vandals from Spain , which they had lost to the Goths ; and when he was sorry for his act , it was too late . Africa was taken from the empire . The violence of these Arians subjected the Church to infinite suffering , and great numbers received the crown of martyrdom ( A.D. 429 ) . Two raging heresies originated at this time : Nestorius , patriarch of Constantinople , divided the person of Jesus Christ , and twenty years later , Eutyches , an archimandrite , merged his two natures . St. Cyrillus , patriarch of Alexandria , opposed Nestorius ( A.D. 430 ) , who was condemned by Pope St. Celestine . Executing this sentence , the third ecumenical council , held at Ephesus ( A.D. 431 ) , deposed Nestorius and confirmed the decree of St. Celestine , whom the assembled bishops by vote called their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , and St. Cyrillus ' doctrine was accepted the world over . After some initial difficulties , Theodosius submitted to the council and banished Nestorius . Eutyches ( A.D. 448 ) , who was unable to combat one heresy without falling into another excess , was just as firmly rejected . Pope St. Leo the Great condemned him , simultaneously refuting him in a letter that was held in veneration everywhere . The fourth ecumenical council , held at Chalcedon ( A.D. 451 ) , where this great pope occupied the first place for his doctrine as much as for the authority of his office , anathematized Eutyches and his protector Dioscorus , patriarch of Alexandria . The letter sent by the council to St. Leo shows that the pope presided over it through his legates , as the head over its limbs . Emperor Marcianus attended this great assembly in person , following Constantine 's example , and he accepted his decisions with the tame respectfulness . Shortly before this Pulcheria had raised him to the position of emperor by marrying him . She had been recognized s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave a son . But the empire needed a master , and the valor of Marcianus brought him that honor . At the time of these two councils , Theodore , bishop of Cyrrhus , became famous ; and his teachings would be unimpeachable if the violent tracts he published against Cyrillus had not been so obscure . He explained them in good faith and was counted among the orthodox bishops . The Gauls were beginning to accept the Franks . Aetius had defended them against Pharamund and Clodio the Hairy ; but Meroveus was more fortunate and established himself more solidly in Gaul about the same time that the Angles , who were Saxon tribes , occupied Great Britain . They gave it their name and founded a number of kingdoms . Meanwhile the Huns , a people from the Meotide Marshes ( ( Sea of Azov , devastated the whole world with an immense army , led by their king , Attila , the most dreadful of men . Aetius , who had defeated him in Gaul ( A.D. 452 ) , was unable to prevent him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retreat to some . Venice rose out of the waters . Pope St. Leo , more powerful than Aetius and the Roman armies , commanded the respect of the barbarian and pagan king and saved Rome from pillage ; but the city was subjected to it very soon thereafter because of the debauchery of its emperor , Valentinian . Maximus ( A.D. 454 ) , whose wife he had raped , found a way to ruin him by hiding his feelings and making a merit out of his complacency ( A.D. 455 ) . Upon his treacherous advice the blinded emperor put to death Aetius , the empire 's only shield . Thereupon , Maximus , the author of that murder , incited Aetius ' friends to seek vengeance and had the emperor killed . Having ascended to the throne by these steps , he forced Empress Eudoxia , daughter of Theodosius the Younger , to marry him . In order to free herself from him , she was not afraid to deliver herself to Gaiseric . Rome fell prey to the barbarian , and only St. Leo was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally the people tore Maximus limb from limb , this sad consolation being the only recompense for their suffering . The situation in the West was becoming more and more embroiled . Several emperors arose and fell almost at the same time . Majorian ( A.D. 456 ) was the most illustrious among them . Avitus ( A.D. 457 ) was hard put to sustain his reputation and saved himself // by becoming a bishop . Gaul could no longer be defended against Meroveus or his son , Childeric , though the latter almost ruined himself by his debauchery . His subjects drove him out ( A.D. 458 ) , but one remaining faithful friend caused him to be recalled ( A.D. 465 ) . His bravery made him feared by his enemies , and his conquests extended far into Gaul . The Eastern empire was peaceful under Leo of Thrace ( A.D. 474 ) , successor to Marcianus , and under Zeno ( A.D. 475 ) , son-in-law and successor to Leo . The revolt of Basiliscus ( A.D. 476 ) was soon put down and caused that emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irretrievably lost . Augustus , son of Orestes , who was called Augustulus , was the last emperor to be recognized in Rome ; and immediately after that , he was deposed by Odoacer , king of the Heruli . They were a people from the Black Sea , and their domination did not last long . In the East , Emperor Zeno was determined to distinguish himself in a completely novel way . He was the first of the emperors to become involved in determining matters of faith . While the semiEutychians were opposing the Council of Chalcedon ( A.D. 482 ) , he published his Henotikon against the council . This was a decree for union which was unacceptable to the Catholics and condemned by Pope Felix III ( A.D. 482 ) . The Heruli were soon driven from Rome by Theodoric ( A.D. 490 ) , king of the Ostrogoths ? that is , East Goths ? who founded the kingdom of Italy ( A.D. 491 ) and who , although of Arian faith himself , permitted the Catholic religion to be observed with relative freedom . Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He followed in the footsteps of his predecessor , Zeno ( A.D. 492 ) , and supported the heretics . In this manner he alienated his subjects ( A.D. 493 ) and could never win them over , even by abolishing burdensome taxes . Italy had yielded to Theodoric . Odoacer , hard pressed in Ravenna , tried to save himself by a treaty which Theodoric did not observe ; and the Heruli were forced to give up altogether . Theodoric held not only Italy but also Provence . In his time , St. Benedict ( A.D. 494 ) , withdrawing to a wilderness in Italy , began to prac jice , from his earliest youth on , the saintly maxims which later became the basis of that wonderful rule accepted by all the monks of the West with the same respect the monks of the East show for the rule of St. Basil . The Romans lost what was left of Gaul through the victories of Clovis , son of Childeric ( A.D. 495 ) . He also won a victory over the Germans at Tolbiac because he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clothilde , constantly urged him to make . She was a member of the royal house of Burgundy and a zealous Catholic , even though her family and her people were Arians . Clovis was catechized by St. Vedast and was baptized at Rheims , with his Frenchmen , by St. Remigius , the bishop of that ancient see . Of all the princes of the world , he alone upheld the Catholic faith and won the title Most Christian ( A.D. 506 ) for his successors . Following the battle in which he killed Alaric ( A.D. 507 ) , king of the Visigoths , with his own hand , Toulouse and Aquitaine were added to his kingdom . But the victory of the Ostrogoths prevented him from taking everything as far as the Pyrenees , and the end of his reign ( A.D. 508 ) tarnished the glory of its beginning . His four children divided the kingdom among themselves ( A.D. 510 ) and continually tried to encroach upon one another . Anastasius was killed by a stroke of lightning . Justin , a man of low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor by the senate ( A.D. 518 ) . He submitted with all his people to the decrees of Pope St. Hormisdas and put an end to the disturbances in the Eastern Church . In his time , Boetius ( A.D. 526 ) , a man famous for his learning as well as for his birth , and his father-inlaw , Symmachus , both of whom were holding very high positions , were sacrificed to the jealousy of Theodoric , who suspected them without cause of conspiring against the state . The king , upset by his crime , imagined seeing the head of Symmachus in a dish that was served to him and died shortly thereafter . Amalasuntha , his daughter , and the mother of Athalaric , who became king upon his grandfather 's death , was prevented by the Goths from giving her son the education to which his birth entitled him ; and , constrained to abandon him to young men of his own age , she watched him going to his ruin , unable to do anything about it . The following year ( A.D. 527 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coemperor . The latter 's long reign was distinguished by the work of Tribonian , the compiler of Roman law , and by the exploits of Belisarius and the eunuch Narses . These two famous captains repulsed the Persians , defeated the Ostrogoths and // the Vandals , and restored Africa , Italy , and Rome to their master ( A.D. 529-53 ) . But the emperor , jealous of their glory but unwilling to share their efforts , was always more of a hindrance than a help to them . The kingdom of France was growing apace ( A.D. 532 ) . After a long war , Childebert and Clotaire , sons of Clovis , conquered the kingdom of Burgundy and , at the same time , sacrificed to their ambition the minor children of their brother Chlodomer , whose kingdom they divided between themselves . Not long thereafter , and while Belisarius was so vigorously attacking the Ostrogoths , their possessions in Gaul were given over to the French . At that time France extended a long way beyond the Rhine , but inheritances created as many kingdoms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under one rule . Its principal parts were Neustria , that is , western France , and Austrasia , that is , eastern France . In the same year that Narses reconquered Rome ( A.D. 553 ) , Justinian convoked the fifth ecumenical council in Constantinople , which confirmed the preceding ones and condemned certain works favorable to Nestorius . These were called the Three Chapters , after the three long-dead authors who were under discussion at that time . The council condemned the memory and the writings of Theodore , bishop of Mopsuestia , one letter by Ibas , bishop of Edessa , and , among the writings of Theodore , those which were directed against St. Cyrillus . The books of Origen , which had agitated the East for a century , were also rejected . This council , though begun with bad intentions , came to a fortunate conclusion and was accepted by the Holy See , which had originally opposed it . Two years after the council ( A.D. 555 ) , Narses , who had taken Italy from the Goths , defended it against the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Austrasian troops . Despite these advantages , Italy did not remain in the possession of the emperors for long . Under Justin II , nephew of Justinian , and after the death of Narses , the kingdom of Lombardy was founded by Alboin ( A.D. 568 ) . He took Milan and Pavia ( A.D. 570 ) , while Rome and Ravenna only just escaped from his power ( A.D. 571 ) ; and the Lombards inflicted the greatest suffering on the Romans . Romo- : ) did not receive much help from its emperors ( A.D. 574 ) , who were tormented on all sides in the East ? by the Avars , a Scythian tribe , by the Saracens of Arabia , and , above all , by the Persians . Justin , who believed only in himself and his own passions , was repeatedly defeated by the Persians and their king , Chosroes . So many losses disturbed him to the point of madness . His wife , Sophia , carried on the affairs of the empire . When the unfortunate prince came to his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he was about to die , he realized the maliciousness of those who had flattered him . After him , Tiberius II , whom he had named emperor , repulsed the enemies , eased the lot of the people ( A.D. 580 ) , and gained spiritual riches through alms-giving . The victories of Maurice of Cappadocia ( A.D. 581 ) , the general of his armies , caused the haughty Chosroes to die of vexation . Maurice was rewarded for these victories with the empire ( A.D. 583 ) , which Tiberius gave him when he died , along with his daughter Constantina . At this time , the ambitious Fredegond , wife of King Chilperic I , caused a general conflagration in France and constantly incited the French kings to cruel wars among themselves . Amidst the misfortunes of Italy , and while Rome was being ravaged by a dreadful pestilence , St. Gregory the Great was elevated , against his will , to St. Peter 's chair ( A.D. 590 ) . This great pope appeased the plague by his prayers ; he taught the emperors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforted and strengthened Africa ; in Spain he confirmed the Visigoths , recently converted from Arianism , and Reccared the Catholic , who had just returned to the bosom of the Church ; he converted England and reformed the religious discipline in France , whose always orthodox kings he exalted above all the kings of the world ; he broke the power of the Lombards ; saved Rome and Italy , whom the emperors could not help ; chastised the nascent arrogance of the patriarchs of Constantinople ; enlightened the whole Church with his learning ; and governed the East and the West with as much vigor as humility , thus giving the world a perfect model of ecclesiastic government . There is nothing more beautiful in the history of the Church than the arrival of the holy monk Augustine and forty of his companions in the kingdom of Kent ( A.D. 597 ) , when , preceded by the Cross and the image of that great king , Our Lord Jesus Christ , they made a // solemn vow for the conversion of England . St. Gregory , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught St. Augustine to stand in awe before the continuous miracles God was performing through his ministry . Bertha , a Frankish princess , won over her husband , King Aethelberht , to Christianity . The kings of France and Queen Brunhilda protected the new mission . The bishops of France also took part in this good work ; and they anointed St. Augustine bishop upon orders from the pope ( A.D. 601 ) . The help which St. Gregory sent the new bishop proved fruitful ( A.D. 604 ) , and the English church took form . Emperor Maurice , having experienced the loyalty of the saintly pontiff , mended his ways , following his advice , and was given the praise truly worthy of a Christian prince when the pope told him that the voice of the heretics did not dare speak in his time . Yet this pious prince committed one serious offense : an infinite number of Romans perished at the hands of the barbarians , since he had failed to redeem them at the price of one silver coin per head ( A.D. 601 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor and his prayers to God , asking for punishment in this world rather than the next . Then we see the revolt of Phocas ( A.D. 602 ) , who slaughtered all of his family before his very eyes ; we see how Maurice , the last to be killed , says nothing in his suffering but the versicle of the Psalmist : Righteous art thou , 0 Lord , and upright are thy judgments . Elevated to the position of emperor by this detestable act , Phocas endeavored to win over his subjects by honoring the Holy See , whose privileges he confirmed . But his sentence was already pronounced ( A.D. 606 ) . Heraclius , proclaimed emperor by the army of Africa , marched against him ( A.D. 610 ) . Now Phocas came to know that debauchery is often more harmful to princes than cruelty ; Photius , whose wife he had corrupted , handed him over to Heraclius , who had him put to death . Shortly thereafter , France witnessed a much stranger tragedy . Queen Brunhilda had fallen into the hands of Clotaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince 's ambition . Her memory was defamed ; and her virtue , so highly praised by St. Gregory , is contested to this very day . Meanwhile , the empire was utterly devastated . Under the pretext of avenging Maurice , Chosroes II , king of Persia , had undertaken to make an end of Phocas . His armies advanced after Heraclius had succeeded Phocas . Heraclius was defeated , and the True Cross was taken by the infidels . Then , in a remarkable reversal , Heraclius won five battles ; Persia was invaded by the Romans ; Chosroes was killed by his son ; and the True Cross was recaptured . While the power of the Persians was being broken in this manner , a greater evil threatened the empire and all of Christendom . Mohammed posed as a prophet among the Saracens , but his people expelled him from Mecca ( A.D. 622 ) . His flight marks the beginning of the famous Hegira , by which the Mohammedans count their years . The false prophet gave his victories as the only proof of his mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means or foul , thus laying the foundation for the empire of the caliphs . To this evil was added the heresy of the Monothelites ( A.D. 629 ) , who , through almost inconceivable eccentricity , though recognizing two natures in Our Lord , wanted to recognize in them only a single will . According to them , the Man did not will anything , so that there was only the will of the Word in Jesus Christ . These heretics were concealing their poison under ambiguous words , and from a spurious love of peace they suggested that one should speak neither of a single will nor of two wills . Such cunning induced Pope Honorius I to treat them with dangerous leniency and to consent to a silence in which both truth and falsehood were suppressed ( A.D. 633 ) . As a crowning misfortune , Emperor Heraclius undertook some time later ( A.n . 639 ) to decide the question on his own authority and proposed his Ecthesis , or Exposition of the Faith , which was favorable to the Monothelites . But in the end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pope John IV condemned the Ecthesis . Heraclius ' grandson , Constans , upheld his grandfather 's edict in an edict of his own called the Typus ( A.D. 648 ) . The Holy See and Pope Theodore opposed his action ( A.D. 649 ) and Pope St. Martin convoked the Lateran synod in which the Typus and the Monothelite leaders were anathematized . St. Maximus , famous throughout the East for his piety and learning , left the court , which was infected by the new heresy , openly criticized the emperors for daring to make pronouncements in matters of faith , and suffered greatly on behalf of the Catholic religion ( A.D. 650 ) . The pope , dragged from exile to exile and always harshly treated by the emperor , finally died in great suffering , without complaining and without abandoning the duties of his ministry ( A.D. 654 ) . Meanwhile , the new English church , strengthened by the solicitude of Popes Bonif ace V and Honorius , became illustrious through-out the world . There was an abundance of miracles and virtue , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking than the saintliness of its kings . Edwin and all his people ( A.D. 627 ) professed the faith that had given him victory over his enemies , and he converted his neighbors . Oswald served as interpreter to the preachers of the Gospel ( A.D. 634 ) ; although renowned for his conquests , he preferred the glory of being a Christian . The Mercians were converted by King Oswio of Northumbria ( A.D. 655 ) ; their neighbors and successors followed in their footsteps , and their good works were immense . The East was going to its ruin . While the emperors were consuming themselves in religious disputes and inventing heresies ( A.D. 634-37 ) , the Saracens invaded the empire ; they occupied Syria and Palestine ; the Holy City came under their domination ; Persia was open to them because of its divisions , and they took that great kingdom without encountering resistance . They entered Africa and soon were able to make it one of their provinces ( A.D. 647 ) ; the island of Cyprus yielded to them ( A.D. 648 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests to those made by Mohammed . Italy , still suffering and helpless , was groaning under the power of the Lombards . Constans lost all hope of driving them out and decided to ravage what he could not defend . More cruel than the Lombards themselves , he went to Rome only to pillage its treasures ( A.D. 663 ) ; even the churches were not safe . He also devastated Sardinia and Sicily . Finally , he had become so hateful to everyone that he perished at the hands of his own men ( A.D. 668 ) . Under his son Constantine Pogonatus , that is , the Bearded , the Saracens took over Cilicia and Lycia ( A.D. 671 ) . Constantinople was besieged and was saved only by a miracle ( A.D. 672 ) . The Bulgarians , a people from the mouth of the Volga , joined the many enemies beleaguering the empire and occupied the part of Thrace now called Bulgaria , which is the ancient Mysia ( A.D. 678 ) . The English church begot new churches ; and St. Wilfrid , bishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friesland . All of the Church received new light from the Council of Constantinople ( A.D. 680 ) , the sixth ecumenical council , where Pope St. Agatho presided through his legates and explained the Catholic faith in an admirable letter . The Council launched its anathema against one bishop famous for his doctrine , one patriarch of Alexandria , and four patriarchs of Constantinople , that is to say , all the authors of the Monothelite sects ; neither did it spare Pope Honorius , who had treated them leniently . After Agatho 's death , which occurred during the Council , Pope St. Leo II confirmed all its decisions and upheld all its anathemas . Constantine Pogonatus imitated the great Constantine and Marcianus when he came to the Council following their example ; and since he expressed the same submission , he was honored with the same titles of Orthodox , Religious , and Peaceful Emperor and Restorer of Religion . His son , Justinian II , succeeded him while still a child ( A.D. 685 ) . In his time , the faith spread to the north ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilian , sent by Pope Conon , preached the Gospel in Franconia ( A.D. 689 ) . At the time of Pope Sergius , Cadwallawn , one of the kings of England , personally went to acknowledge the Roman church , which had brought the faith to his island . Having been baptized by the pope himself , he died in the manner which he had desired . The house of Clovis had fallen into deplorable weakness . Because its princes were so often minors , they had become so pampered that they were unable to stand on their own feet once they were grown up . Hence there was a long line of do-nothing kings , who were king in name only and left all the power to their mayor of the palace . Under that title Pepin of Herstal governed their realm ( A.D. 693 ) and raised the expectations of his house . By his authority , and after the martyrdom of St. Wigbert ( A.D. 695 ) , the faith was established in Friesland , which France had just added to its conquests . St. Swidbert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighboring provinces . Meanwhile , the minority of Justinian had been a fortunate time . The victories of Leontius had broken the power of the Saracens and restored the glory of the Eastern empire . But when this valiant captain was unjustly arrested and released for the wrong reason , he cut off his master 's nose and drove him out ( A.D. 694 ) . The rebel suffered a similar treatment at the hand of Tiberius ( A.D. 696 ) , surnamed Absimarus , who did not last long himself . After his restoration , Justinian showed no gratitude to his friends ( A.D. 702 ) , and by taking revenge upon his enemies he created new and more dangerous ones , who finally killed him . The images of his successor , Philippicus , were not received in Rome ( A.D. 711 ) , because he favored the Monothelites and strongly opposed the sixth council . At Constantinople , Anastasius II , a Catholic prince , was elected ( A.D. 713 ) , and Philippicus had his eyes gouged out . In the same time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the Moors , as the Saracens of Africa were called . Count Julian ( ( of Ceuta called in the infidels in order to avenge his daughter , who was being taken advantage of by Roderick . They came with an immense army , and the king perished ; Spain was subjugated , and the Spanish empire of the Goths came to an end . Again the church of Spain was put to the test ; but , just as it had been preserved under the Arians , the Mohammedans were unable to destroy it . In the beginning they left it relatively free ; but in the following centuries it had to endure great suffering , and chastity as well as faith found its martyrs under the tyranny of a nation that was as brutal as it was infidel . Emperor Anastasius did not last long . The army forced Theodosius III to accept the purple ( A.D. 715 ) . The two were pitted against each other in a battle ; and when the new emperor won , Anastasius was put into a monastery . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their domination beyond the Pyrenees . But Charles Martel , destined to halt them , had become great in France and , though of illegitimate birth , had succeeded his father , Pepin of Herstal , who bequeathed Austrasia to his family as a kind of sovereign principality , and the command of Neustria as part of his office of mayor of the palace . Charles united all of this by his valor . The situation in the East was confused ( A.D. 716 ) . Leo III , the world amidst his grandeur and his victories , took up the monastic life . Therefore , all the power fell to his brother , Pepin . He was able to maintain it by his great merit and decided to aspire to royal rank . Childeric , the most wretched of princes , opened his way to it , adding the quality of a fool to his indolence ( A.D. 752 ) . The French , disgusted with their do-nothing kings and accustomed for so long to the house of Charles Martel , which had given them many great men , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon the response of Pope Zacharias , they felt free and , all the more , absolved from the oath they had sworn to their king , as for the last hundred years he and his forebears seemed to have renounced the right to command by permitting all the power to become attached to the office of mayor of the palace . Thus Pepin was placed on the throne , and the title and the authority of kingship were united . Pope Stephen III ( A.D. 753 ) found that the new king was as eager as Charles Martel had been to defend the Holy See against the Lombards . Having in vain beseeched the emperor for help , he cast his lot with the French . The king respectfully received him in France and wished to be anointed and crowned by his hands ( A.D. 754 ) . At the same time , he crossed the Alps , freed Rome and the exarchate of Ravenna , and forced Aistulf , king of the Lombards , to conclude an equitable peace . Meanwhile , the emperor made war on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ecclesiastic authority , he convoked a sizable council to Constantinople . Yet neither the legates of the Holy See , nor the bishops , nor the legates of the other patriarchal sees appeared there , as they ordinarily did . This council not only condemned as idolatry any honor given to images in memory of their originals ; it also condemned sculpture and painting as arts to be execrated . This was the opinion of the Saracens , whose advice Leo was said to have followed when he overthrew the images . Nothing , however , was said against relics . Copronymus ' council did not prohibit honoring them , and it anathematized those who refused to have recourse to the intercession of the Holy Virgin and the saints . When the Catholics were persecuted for honoring the images , they gave the emperor to know that they preferred the most extreme suffering to not honoring Jesus Christ even in his shadow . Meanwhile , Pepin again crossed the Alps and chastised the faithless Aistulf ( A.D. 755 ) , who refused to abide by the peace treaty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given by this pious prince . He gave it the towns he had reconquered from the Lombards and paid no attention to Copronymus , who demanded that they be restored to him , unable though he had been to defend them . From this time on , the emperors had little credit in Rome , where they were scorned for their weakness and detested for their errors . Pepin came to be regarded as the protector of the Roman people and the Roman church . In a certain sense , this quality has become hereditary to his house and to the kings of France . Charlemagne , Pepin 's son , upheld the Church with as much courage as piety . Pope Hadrian appealed to him ( A.D. 772 ) for help against Desiderius , king of the Lombards , who had taken several towns and was threatening all of Italy . Charlemagne crossed the Alps ( A.D. 773 ) . Everything gave way before him , and Desiderius was handed over ( A.D. 774 ) . The Lombard kings , enemies of Rome and its popes , were destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of King of the French and the Lombards . At the same time , he exercised sovereign authority in Rome itself , in his quality of patrician , and confirmed the donations his royal father had made to the Holy See . The emperors were hard put to resist the Bulgarians , and they tried in vain to support the dispossessed Lombards against Charlemagne . The controversy over the images continued to rage ( A.D. 780 ) . Leo IV , the son of Copronymus , seemed to be less harsh in the beginning ; but he renewed the persecution as soon as he believed himself to be in control . He soon died . Constantine , his ten-year-old son , succeeded him and reigned under the guardianship of his mother , Empress Irene . At this point , things began to take a different turn ( A.D. 784 ) . Paul , the patriarch of Constantinople , declared toward the end of his life that he had combatted the veneration of images against his conscience , and he retired to a monastery . There , in the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Constantinople , separated as it was from the four patriarchal sees , and told her that the holding of an ecumenical council would be the only remedy for this unhappy situation . His successor Tarasius maintained that the question had not been judged in the proper order ; since the point of departure had been a decree from the emperor , an improper council had ensued , while , in matters of religion , it is the duty of the council to initiate the procedure and the duty of the emperors to support the judgment of the Church . For this reason , he accepted the patriarchate only on condition that the ecumenical council be held ; and in fact it was begun at Constantinople ( A.D. 787 ) and continued at Nicaea . The pope sent his legates , and the council of the iconoclasts was condemned . Henceforth we detest them as men who , following the example of the Saracens , accused the Christians of idolatry . It was decided that images should be honored in memory and out of love for the originals ; this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honorary salutation " as opposed to " supreme worship and veneration of the image , or entire submission , " which the council reserved for God alone . Not only the legates of the Holy See and the patriarch of Constantinople in person were present , but also legates of the other patriarchal sees which at that time were occupied by the infidels . Their mission has sometimes been questioned ; but no one has questioned that , far from disavowing their legates , all these sees have accepted the Council without voicing any opposition , and that it has been accepted by the entire Church . The French , surrounded as they were by idol-worshipers or new Christians , whose ideas they feared to confuse , and perplexed , furthermore , by the equivocal term " veneration , " hesitated for a considerable time . Of all the images , they wanted to give honor only to that of the Cross , since it was entirely different from the figures which the pagans believed to be filled with divinity . Yet they kept other images in honored places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining diversity did not lead to any schism . The French finally realized that the Fathers of Nicaea demanded for images only the same kind of worship which , in their own way , they already had for relics , the books of the Gospel , and the Cross . Thus the Council was honored by all of Christendom under the name of seventh ecumenical council . Thus we have seen the seven ecumenical councils , which are held in equal veneration by the East and the West , by the Greek Church // and the Latin Church . The emperors convoked these great assemblies by their sovereign authority over all bishops , or at least the principal ones , who directed all the others and who at that time were subjects of the empire . Public conveyances were furnished to them by order of the princes . They assembled the councils in the East , where they resided , and usually dispatched commissioners to maintain order . Assembled in this manner , the bishops embodied the authority of the Holy Spirit and the Tradition **12;108; of the churches . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which took precedence over all the others , namely , those of Rome , Alexandria , and Antioch . The Council of Nicaea had approved that the bishops of the Holy City should have the same rank . The second and the fourth councils raised the rank of the see of Constantinople and decided that it should be second . Thus five sees were created which in time came to be called patriarchal . Their precedence was established by the council . Among all these sees , that of Rome was always considered to be the first , and the Council of Nicaea used it as the model for the others . There were also metropolitan bishops , who were at the head of provinces and took precedence over other bishops . They were not called archbishops until rather late ; nonetheless , their authority was recognized . When the council was formed , the study of the Holy Scriptures was proposed . Passages from the ancient Church Fathers were read , since they are witnesses to the Tradition ; and it was the Tradition which interpreted the Scriptures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which past centuries had agreed , and no one felt he had the right to explain them differently . Those who refused to submit to the decisions of the council were stricken with anathema . After the faith had been explained , the discipline of the Church was regulated , and canons ? that is , rules of the Church ? were established . It was believed that the faith never changed and that , though the discipline was susceptible to various changes , according to time and place , one should aim as much as possible for a perfect imitation of the early Church . The popes , incidentally , took part in the first councils only through their legates ; but they expressly approved their teaching , and there was only one faith in the Church . Constantine and Irene ( A.D. 787 ) saw to it that the decretals of the seventh council were executed religiously , but in other ways their conduct did not keep pace . The young prince , who had been forced by his mother to marry a woman he did not love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blindly obeying his domineering mother , he tried to remove her from the affairs of state , in which she continued to interfere against his will . Alphonso the Chaste was reigning in Spain ( A.D. 793 ) . By his perpetual continence , this prince deserved his epithet and also became worthy of freeing Spain from the shameful tribute of a hundred maidens which his uncle Maurecat had accorded the Moors . A battle in which 70,000 of these infidels and their general , Mugait , were killed proved Alphonso 's worth . Constantine also tried to distinguish himself against the Bulgarians , but his success was not commensurate with his expectations . In the end he completely broke Irene 's power ( A.D. 795 ) , and , being as incapable of governing himself as of tolerating the domination of another person , he repudiated his wife Marie in order to marry her servant Theodota . In her anger , his mother fomented the disorders created by this great scandal ( A.D. 796 ) . Her guile caused Constantine 's end ( A.D. 797 ) . She gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the clergy by her apparent piety . Finally she was recognized as sole empress . The Romans were contemptuous of this government and turned to Charlemagne , who subjugated the Saxons , repressed the Saracens , destroyed heresies , protected the popes , won the infidel nations for Christianity , restored the sciences and the ecclesiastic discipline , convoked famous councils in which his profound learning was admired , and made the benefits of his piety and justice felt , not only in France and Italy , but also in Spain , England , Germany , and everywhere . Twelfth Epoch CHARLEMAGNE , OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW EMPIRE Finally , in the year of Our Lord 800 , this great protector of Rome and Italy or , rather , of all the Church and of all Christendom , was // elected emperor by the Romans without having sought that honor , and was crowned by Pope Leo III , who had persuaded the Roman people to make that choice . In this manner he became the founder of the new empire and of the temporal greatness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelve epochs I have followed in this condensation . I have presented each one of them with the principal events attached to it . Now it will not be very difficult for you to see the great events of ancient history in their proper place in time and to line up each one of them , as it were , under its own banner . In this condensation I have not forgotten the famous division of world history into seven ages , which is made by the chronologists . The beginning of each age serves us as an epoch ; and if I have brought in a number of others , it was in order to make certain things stand out more distinctly and to develop the sequence of ages more clearly . If I speak to you of the sequence of ages , this does not mean , Monseigneur , that you should scrupulously encumber yourself with all the dates ; even less should you go into all the disputes of the chronologists , which usually involve only a few years . Controversies over chronology , with their scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are not your concern and are of very little use when it comes to enlightening the mind of a great prince . It was not my intention to make fine points in this discussion of ages ; and , among the available calculations , I have followed those that seemed the most probable to me , without trying to guarantee them . Whether the reckoning of the years between the time of the Creation and Abraham should be made according to the Septuagint , which makes the world older , or according to the Hebrew version , which makes it younger by several centuries ? even though it seems that the authority of the Hebrew original should count for more ? is in itself a question of so little importance that the Church , which , following St. Jerome , has accepted the reckoning of the Hebrew version in our Vulgate , has preserved that of the Septuagint in its Martyrology . And indeed , what difference does it make to history whether we lengthen or shorten empty centuries , since , in any case , there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages in which there are important dates have a firm contour and that their division is based on solid foundations ? And even if there were differences of opinions for a few years of these ages , it would hardly ever matter . With regard to the question , for example , whether the foundation of Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ should be placed a few years earlier or later , you are now in a position to realize that this diversity does not in any way influence either the course of events or the accomplishment of God 's decrees . You must avoid those anachronisms which confuse the order of events and let others be debated by scholars . Neither do I wish to encumber your mind with counting the olympiads , though the fact that the Greeks used them makes them necessary to identify the ages . You only need to know what they are in order to have recourse to them when necessary . As for the rest , it is sufficient to keep in mind the dates I have offered you as the simplest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Rome , those of Rome until Jesus Christ , and those of Jesus Christ for the remaining time . But this condensation is not really intended to explain to you the sequence of the ages , indispensable though they are for tying all the histories together and for showing their interrelation . As I pointed out to you , Monseigneur , it is my principal aim to put before you , in the sequence of the ages , the history of God 's people and that of the great empires . These two things move on together in the great movement of the centuries , where they follow the same course , as it were . But in order to understand them fully , it is sometimes necessary to separate them and to examine in detail the things which are peculiar to each . Chapter 1 THE CREATION AND THE EARLY AGES Religion and the continued existence of the people of God throughout the centuries is the greatest and most useful of all things a man can study . It is a noble thing to review the different states of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patriarchs ; under Moses and the Written Law ; under David and the prophets ; from the return out of the Captivity until Jesus Christ ; and , finally , under Jesus Christ himself , that is , under the Law of Grace and the Gospel ; in the ages that expected the Messiah , and in those wherein he appeared ; in the ages when the worship of God was confined to one people , and in those in which , in accordance with the ancient prophecies , it was spread abroad over all the earth ; in the ages , finally , when men , still full of infirmity and grossness , needed the support of temporal rewards and punishments , and in those wherein the faithful , better instructed , are thenceforth to live by faith alone , having their hearts set upon eternal good things and , in the hope of possessing them , are suffering all the evils that can try their patience . And surely , Monseigneur , nothing can be conceived more worthy of God than to have , first of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of his eternal Providence ; a people whose good or ill fortune should depend upon their piety or impiety and whose condition should testify to the wisdom and justice of him who governed them . With this did God begin , and this did he make manifest in the Jewish people . But after having , by so many tangible proofs , established this immovable foundation ? that he alone disposes , as he wishes , all the events of this life ? it was time to raise men 's minds to higher notions and to send Jesus Christ , who was chosen to show the secrets of the life-to-come to the new people , who had gathered from all the nations of the world . 113 // You may easily trace the history of both of these people and observe how Jesus Christ unites them ; since either while awaited or after having come , he has been , in all ages , the consolation and hope of the children of God . Religion has therefore always been uniform or , rather , always the same since the Creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged as the Creator , and the same Christ as the Savior , of mankind . Thus you will see that there is nothing more ancient among men than the religion you profess and that it is not without reason that your ancestors have considered their greatest glory to lie in being its protectors . What a convincing testimony it is of the truth of your religion to find that , in times when secular histories have nothing to tell us but fables or , at most , confused and half-forgotten facts , the Scriptures ? indisputably the most ancient book in the world ? carry us back , by so many precise events and by the very succession of things , to their true principle , that is to say , to God , the author of everything , and point out to us so distinctly the creation of the universe , that of man in particular , the happiness of his first state , the causes of his miseries and frailties , the corruption of the world and the Flood , the origin of arts and nations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind and other matters of like importance of which human histories speak only confusedly , obliging us to seek undisputed sources elsewhere . But though the antiquity of religion gives it so much authority , its continued existence without interruption and without alteration during so many ages , in spite of so many intervening obstacles , shows clearly God 's sustaining hand . What can be more wonderful than to behold religion enduring upon the same foundations from the beginning of the world ? Neither the idolatry and impiety which surrounded it on all sides , nor the tyrants who persecuted it , nor the heretics and infidels who endeavored to corrupt it , nor the cowards who basely betrayed it , nor its unworthy followers who dishonored it by their crimes , nor , lastly , the great length of time , which alone is sufficient to lay low all things // human , has ever been able , I shall not say to destroy it , but to alter it . If we now consider what idea that religion whose antiquity we revere gives us of its object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess that this idea is beyond all human conception and worthy of being regarded as coming from God himself . The God whom the Jews and Christians have always served has nothing in common with the divinities full of imperfection and even of vice whom the rest of the world adored . Our God is one , infinite , perfect , alone worthy to avenge wickedness and to crown virtue , because he alone is holiness itself . He is infinitely above that first cause and prime mover known by philosophers , though they did not worship it . Those of them who pursued the question farthest have proposed for us a God who , finding eternal matter which existed in its own right , as he himself did , put it to use and fashioned it like a common craftsman , limited in his work by that matter and its dispositions , which he had not made . These philosophers were never able to comprehend that , if matter existed of itself , it would not have to await an outside hand to be perfected and that , if God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own almighty will to make whatever he pleased . But the God of our fathers , the God of Abraham , the God whose wonders Moses recorded , did not merely arrange the world ; he created it entirely , in both its matter and its form . Until he gave being , nothing existed but himself alone . He is shown to us as the Creator of all things and as making all things by his word , not only because he makes all things by reason , but also because he makes all things without effort ; and the performance of such great works costs him but a single word , that is , it costs him but to will it . Now , since we have begun it , let us pursue the history of the Creation . Moses has taught us that this mighty architect , whose works cost him so little , wanted to do it in stages and to create the universe in six days , to show that he does not act out of necessity or blind impetuosity , as some philosophers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreservedly , all the rays it has ; but God , who acts by understanding and with sovereign liberty , applies his // power where he pleases and as much as he pleases ; and as in making the world by his word he shows that nothing is difficult for him , so by making it in stages he demonstrates that he is master of his matter , of his action , of the whole undertaking and that he has , in acting , no other rule than his own will , which is always right in itself . This manner of acting on God 's part also shows us that everything proceeds immediately from his hand . The peoples and the philosophers who believed that the earth , mixed with water and assisted , if you will , by the heat of the sun , had , of itself and by its own fruitfulness , produced plants and animals have most grossly erred . The Scriptures have given us to understand that the elements are barren unless the word of God makes them fruitful . Neither the earth , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth the plants and animals which we see if God , who had made and prepared their matter , had not also formed it by his almighty will and given to each thing the seed proper for its multiplication throughout the centuries . Those who see that the plants are brought forth and grow by the sun 's heat might fancy that the sun is their creator . But the Scriptures show us the earth clothed with grasses and all manner of plants before the sun was created in order that we may understand that everything depends on God alone . It pleased this great craftsman to create the light even before he had reduced it to the form he gave it in the sun and stars because he meant to teach us that those great and glorious luminaries , of which some have thought fit to make deities , had in their own right neither that precious and shining matter of which they were composed nor that admirable form to which we see them reduced . In short , the account of the Creation as given by Moses shows us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute power dwell in God alone . Happy , wise , almighty , alone selfsufficient , he acts without necessity , as he acts without need ; never compelled or impeded by matter , of which he makes what he pleases , because by his very will he has given it the foundation of its being . By this sovereign right he turns it , he molds it , he moves it , effortlessly ; everything depends immediately upon him ; and if , according to the order established in nature , one thing depends on // another , as , for instance , the birth and growth of plants depend upon the heat of the sun , it is because the same God who made all the parts of the universe has been pleased to link them to one another and to display his wisdom by that wonderful linking of parts . But nothing that the Holy Scriptures teach us concerning the creation of the universe compares with what they say of the creation of man . Hitherto God had done everything by commanding : Let there be light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters . Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place : and let the dry land appear . Let the earth bring forth . Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night . Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life and the fowl that may fly over the earth . Let the earth bring forth the moving creature . But when it comes to creating man , Moses ascribes to God a different mode of expression : Let us make man , he says , in our image , after our likeness . It is no longer that authoritative word of command but one more mild , though no less efficacious . God takes counsel with himself : God arouses himself , as it were , to show us that the work he is now contemplating surpasses all the works he has hitherto performed . Let us make man . God speaks within himself ; he speaks to someone who creates as well as he , to someone of whom man is the creature and image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by whom all things were made , to him who says in his Gospel , What things soever the Father doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . In speaking to his son , or with his son , he speaks at the same time with the almighty Spirit , equal and coeternal with both of them . Nowhere in the entire Scriptures does anyone but God speak of himself in the plural , Let us make . God himself speaks this way only two or three times in the Scriptures , and this extraordinary language is used for the first time when it is a question of creating man . When God changes his language , and in some way his manner of acting also , it is not that he himself changes ; he shows us only that he is going to begin , according to his eternal counsels , a new order of things . // Thus man , so highly exalted above the other creatures whose creation Moses had described to us , is brought forth in an entirely new manner . The Trinity manifests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose intellectual operations are an imperfect image of those eternal operations whereby God is fruitful in himself . The word " counsel , " which God uses , denotes that the creature about to be created is the only one that can act by counsel and understanding . All the rest is no less extraordinary . Until then we had not seen , in the history of Genesis , the hand of God applied to corruptible matter . But to form the body of man , God himself takes earth ; and that earth , molded by such a hand , receives the most beautiful form that has yet appeared in the world . Man 's body is straight , his head is held high , and his sight is turned toward Heaven . This form , which is his alone , shows him whence he has come and whither he must go . The particular care with which God creates man shows us that he felt a special concern for him , even though everything was immediately guided by his wisdom . But the manner in which he brought forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw it from matter but breathed it in from above . It is a breath of life that proceeds from God himself . When he created the beasts , he said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature , and in this manner he created the sea monsters and every moving living creature that was to fill the waters . He said also , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beasts of the earth . Thus were to be brought forth those living creatures whose life is brutish and bestial and to which God allots no other action than motions dependent on the body . God called them forth from the depths of the sea and the earth ; but that soul , whose life was to be an imitation of his own , which was to live as he does by reason and understanding , which was to be united to him by contemplating and loving him , and which therefore was made in his image , could not be derived from matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful body , but no turning or fashioning will ever make him find in it his own image and likeness . The soul , made after his image and capable of being happy in the enjoyment of him , must be brought // forth by a new creation : it must come from above ; and this is what is meant by that breath of life which God draws from his mouth . Let us always remember that by tangible images Moses showed pure and intellectual truths to carnal men . Let us not imagine that God breathes after the manner of animals ; let us not fancy that our soul is a subtle air or thin vapor . The breath which comes from God and which bears in itself the image of God is neither air nor vapor . Let us not believe that our soul is a portion of the divine nature , as some philosophers have dreamed . God is not a whole that can be divided . Even if God had parts , they would not be created ones . For the Creator , the uncreated being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made , and so made that it is no part of the divine nature but only a substance made in the image and likeness of the divine nature : a substance that will always continue united to him that formed it . This is the meaning of that divine breathing ; that is what the breath of life represents to us . Thus , then , was man formed . From him God also fashions the companion he is pleased to give him . All men are born from a single marriage , in order to belong forever to but one and the same family , however dispersed or multiplied . Our first parents , thus formed , are placed in that delightful garden which is called Paradise . God owed it to himself to make his image happy . He gives one command to man to let him know he has a master : a command relating to a tangible thing , because man was made with senses ; an easy command , because he wished to make man 's life agreeable as long as it was innocent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow : he hearkens to the tempting spirit and to himself , instead of hearkening to God only ; his Fall is inevitable ; but we must consider it in its origin as well as in its consequences . In the beginning God had made his angels pure spirits distinct from all matter . He who does only good had created them all in holiness , and they had it in their power to secure lasting bliss by voluntarily submitting to the Creator . But whatever is derived from nothing is fallible . Some of those angels allowed themselves to be seduced by self-love . Woe to the creature that delights in itself and // not in God ! In a moment it loses all God 's gifts . What a strange result of sin ! Those spirits of light became spirits of darkness ; all the light that was left them turned into malicious cunning . An evil envy now took the place of love ; their original greatness now was only pride ; their happiness was changed into the dismal comfort of finding companions in their misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tempting men . The most perfect of them all , who had also been the most proud , proved the most mischievous , as he was the most miserable . Man , whom God hath made a little lower than the angels by giving him a body , became an object of jealousy to so perfect a spirit ; he wished to draw him into his rebellion so that he might afterward involve him in his destruction . The spiritual creatures had , like God himself , tangible means of communicating with man , who was their equal in the principal part of his being . The evil spirits , whom God was willing to use to test the fidelity of mankind , had not lost the means to maintain this intercourse with our nature , any more than they had lost a certain power over material creation , which had been given them in the beginning . Satan made use of this power against our first parents . God permitted him to speak to them in the form of a serpent , as the serpent was best suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we shall see in a moment . Satan is not afraid that he will horrify them by taking this shape . All the animals had been brought to Adam 's feet in the same way , to receive from him a suitable name and to recognize the sovereign whom God had given them . Thus none of the animals aroused horror in man , because , his state was such that no animal could harm him. * Let us hear now how Satan speaks to man and let us understand his guile . He addresses himself to Eve , as to the weaker ; but in the person of Eve he speaks to her husband as well as to her . Why has God forbidden you to do this ? If he has made you reasonable creatures , you ought to know the reason of everything : this fruit is not poison . Ye shall not surely die . This is the beginning of the spirit of revolt : first , the command is discussed , and then obedience is brought into doubt . Ye shall be as gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through yourselves . Knowing good and evil , nothing shall be unfathomable to you . By these persuasive arguments the deluding spirit sets himself up against the Creator 's order and above his rule . Eve , half convinced , looks upon the fruit whose beauty promised an excellent taste . Knowing that God had given man a soul and a body , she thought that as a favor to man he might also have attached supernatural properties to plants and intellectual gifts to palpable objects . Having eaten of this beautiful fruit , she herself offered it to her husband as well . What a dangerous predicament ! Her example and his desire to please add strength to the temptation : he takes the side of the tempter , who is so ably seconded : deceitful curiosity , a flattering feeling of pride , the secret pleasure of acting independently and according to his own mind allure and blind him : he is willing to put his liberty to this dangerous test , and with the forbidden fruit he tastes the pernicious sweetness of satisfying his mind ; there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his senses , submits to them , and becomes their slave , he who was formerly their master . At the same time , everything changes for him . The earth no longer smiles upon him as formerly ; he shall receive no more from it other than by persistent labor ; the sky no longer seems serene ; the animals , which all , even the most odious and fierce , used to afford him an innocent pastime , assume hideous forms . God , who had made everything for his happiness , in a moment turns everything into his punishment . He who had loved himself so well is now a burden to himself . The rebellion of his senses makes him observe in himself something shameful . He is no longer that finest work of the Creator , which was completely perfect . Sin has created something new that must be hidden . Man can no longer bear his shame and would fain hide it from his own eyes . But God becomes even more unbearable to him . That great God , who had made him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help to his understanding , was pleased to show himself to him in a tangible form . But man can no longer endure his presence . He seeks the deepest recesses of the woods , to hide himself from the presence of him who formerly was his whole happiness . His conscience accuses him before God ever speaks . His woeful excuses complete his embarrassment . He must die ; the remedy of immortality is taken // its pleasing colors , agreeably diversified on a cloud filled with harmless dew rather than with a harsh rain , as an eternal testimony that the rains he would henceforth send would never cause a universal flood . Since that time , the rainbow appears in heavenly visions as one of the principal ornaments of the throne of God , and it conveys the idea of his mercies . The world becomes new again , and the earth once more rises from the depths of the waters ; but in this new world there remains a lasting impression of divine vengeance . Until the Flood , all nature was stronger and more vigorous ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , and their long sojourn on it , had altered the essences it contained ; the air , laden with excessive moisture , strengthened the process of decomposition ; and , the original constitution of the world being thus weakened , the human life-span , which previously had run to nearly a thousand years , gradually decreased ; herbs and fruits no longer had their former strength , and men needed a more substantial food in the flesh of animals . Thus the remains of the original way of life would gradually disappear and vanish ; and changed nature gave man to understand that God was no longer the same to him ever since he had become angered by so many crimes . Moreover , that long life of the first men , recorded in the annals of God 's people , has not been unknown to other nations , and their ancient traditions have preserved the memory of it . Now that death advanced with swifter steps , men felt a speedier vengeance ; and as they daily plunged deeper and deeper into wickedness , it was fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged deeper into their punishment . The change to a diet of meat might alone have intimated to them how much their state was deteriorating , since , while becoming weaker , they at the same time became more voracious and bloodthirsty . Before the Flood , men found food peacefully in fruits which fell of their own accord and in grasses , which in any case would have withered very quickly . This nourishment was , no doubt , some remnant of the primitive innocence and of the mildness for which we were created . Now , for our nourishment , we must shed blood , in spite of the horror this naturally arouses in us ; and all the niceties we // use in setting our tables are scarcely sufficient to disguise the carcasses we must devour in order to satisfy ourselves . But that is but the least of our misfortunes . Life , already shortened , is still more abridged by the violence which sprang up among mankind . Man , who in the first times spared the life of beasts , has now learned not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , immediately after the Flood , forbid the shedding of human blood . In vain , to preserve some vestiges of the primeval mildness of our nature , did he make the blood of animals an exception when he allowed man to eat their flesh . Murders multiplied without measure . I t is true that before the Flood Cain had sacrificed his brother to his jealousy , that Lamech , a descendant of Cain , had committed the second murder , and that quite possibly other murders were committed following those damnable examples . But war had not yet been invented . It is after the Flood that we see the first of those ravagers of provinces , called conquerors , who , spurred on only by t he glory of command , have exterminated so many innocent victims . Nimrod , a cursed spawn of Ham , who was cursed by his father , began to make war merely to establish an empire for himself . Ever since that time , ambition has wantonly sported with the lives of men . I hey went so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glory and the most noble of all arts was to put one another to death . Some one hundred years after the Flood , God struck mankind %%ith another scourge through the confusion of tongues . The common language spoken by the first men and taught by Adam to his children would have remained a social bond when the family of Noah had to disperse throughout the habitable world . But this vestige of ancient harmony perished at the Tower of Babel . This tower may have been attempted by the children of Adam because they were still incredulous and had so little faith in the promise and assurance of God that there would not be another flood that they sought refuge against a similar occurrence in the solidity and the height of that proud edifice . Or it may be that they merely wished to immortalize themselves by this great work before scattering abroad Into all lands , as is stated in the Book of Genesis . In any case , God did not permit them to raise this tower to the clouds , as they had hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the erection of that // bold structure . God brought confusion among them by making them forget their first language . It was at this place , therefore , that the children of Adam became divided in language and nationality . The name Babel , which means confusion , remained attached to the tower in testimony to that confusion and also as a perpetual reminder to mankind that pride is the source of division and discord among men . Such were the beginnings of the world , as the history of Moses describes them : beginnings happy at first , but afterward filled with misfortunes ; always admirable , since related to God , who makes all things ; such beginnings , in short , that we , by thinking them over in our mind , learn to see the universe and mankind as always in the Creator 's hand , brought forth out of nothing by his word , preserved by his goodness , governed by his wisdom , punished by his justice , delivered by his mercy , and always subject to his power . This is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some , by a fortuitous concourse of first particles or , according to the wisest of them , furnishing its matter to its author ; which consequently is dependent on him neither for the essence of its being nor for its original state , and which subjects him to certain laws , which he himself can not violate . Moses and our ancient fathers , whose traditions Moses has collected , give us other notions . The God he has made manifest to us has a very different power : he can do and undo just as he pleases ; he gives laws to Nature and abrogates them when he wishes . If , in order to make himself known in times when most men had forgotten him , he wrought astonishing miracles and forced Nature to depart from its most constant laws , he did so to continue to demonstrate that he was its absolute master and that his will is the only bond that preserves the order of the world . And this was just what men had forgotten . The stability of so beautiful an order now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , that it existed of itself . Thus they were prompted to worship either the world as a whole or else the stars , the elements , and all the great bodies which compose it . God therefore showed mankind a goodness worthy of himself when , upon remarkable occasions , he reversed that order , which not only no longer impressed them , because they had become used to it , but which even // prompted them ? so grossly were they blinded ? to imagine eternity and independence elsewhere than in God . The history of God 's people is attested by its own successive stages and by the religion , not only of those who wrote it , but of those who have so carefully preserved it . It has kept , as in a faithful record , the memory of those miracles and thereby gives us a true idea of the supreme dominion of God , almighty master of his creatures , either to hold them subject to the general laws he has established or to give them others when he deems it necessary by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God whom Moses has shown us in his writings as the only one we ought to serve ; such the God whom the patriarchs worshiped before Moses ' birth ; in a word , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; to whom our father Abraham was willing to sacrifice his only son ; of whom Melchizedek , the symbol of Jesus ( ' hrist , was high priest ; to whom our father Noah sacrificed upon leaving the ark ; whom righteous Abel had acknowledged when he offered him that which was most precious to him ; whom Seth , given to Adam in place of Abel , had made known to his children , called also the children of God ; whom Adam himself had shown to his descendants , as him out of whose hands he had lately come and who alone could put an end to the woes of his unhappy posterity . O excellent philosophy , which gives us such pure ideas of the author of our being ! Excellent tradition , which preserves for us the memory of his glorious works ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uninterrupted succession , from the origin of the world down to our day , they have always preserved so holy a tradition and philosophy ! Chapter 2 ABRAHAM AND THE PATRIARCHS But since God 's people began to take a more definite form under the patriarch Abraham , it will be necessary , Monseigneur , to dwell with you at some length upon that great man . // He was born about 350 years after the Flood , at a time when human life , though reduced to narrower limits , was still very long . Noah had just died ; Shem , his eldest son , was still alive , and Abraham was able to spend most of his life with him . Imagine , then , the world still new and still , so to speak , drenched with the waters of the Flood , when men , so near the origin of things , in order to know the unity of God and the service that was due to him needed nothing but the tradition which had been preserved from Adam and Noah : a tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would have thought that so clear and important a truth could never have been obscured or forgotten among men . Such is the first state of religion , which continued down to Abraham and in which , to know the greatness of God , men had to consult only their reason and memory . But reason was weak and corrupted ; and the farther men became removed from the origin of things , the more confused they were about the ideas which had come down to them from their ancestors . Disobedient or unmannerly children would no longer believe what their decrepit grandfathers had said , since they scarcely knew them after so many generations ; man 's mind had sunk so low that it could no longer rise to intellectual matters ; and since men now chose to worship only what they saw , idolatry spread over the whole world . The spirit who had beguiled the first man now tasted the full fruit of his seduction and beheld the complete result of his saying , Ye shall be as gods . From the moment he uttered that word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God with that of the creature and to divide a name whose majesty consists in being uncommunicable . His scheme succeeded . But men , though sunk in flesh and blood , had preserved an obscure idea of divine power , which maintained itself by its own force but which , mingled with the images that entered men through their senses , made them worship all things in which they perceived any activity or power . Thus the sun and stars , which made their influence felt at such a distance , and fire and the elements whose effects were so universal , became the first objects of public adoration . The great kings and the great conquerors , who were so mighty on earth , and the authors of inventions useful to human life soon after received divine honors . Men now paid the // price for having given in to their senses : the senses decided everything and created , in spite of reason , all the gods that were worshiped on earth . How distant man now seemed from his first state ! And how badly God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him with those perverse inclinations that were becoming more manifest every day ? And did not his amazing propensity to submit to everything but his natural Lord betray too visibly the strange hand by which God 's workmanship had been so deeply altered in the human mind that scarcely any trace of it could be found ? Driven by that blind impulse which swayed him , he sank into idolatry , and there was nothing to halt his downward course . So great an evil made wonderful progress . For fear it should infect all mankind and utterly extinguish the knowledge of God , the great God called from on high his servant Abraham , in whose family he meant to establish his worship and preserve the ancient belief as to the Creation of the universe as well as to the special Providence with which he governs human things . Abraham has always been well known in the East . The Hebrews are not the only ones who look upon him as their father . The Iclumaeans also take pride in the same origin . Ishmael , son of Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They continue to practice circumcision as the mark of their origin , and they have always received it , not on the eighth day , after the manner of the Jews , but in their thirteenth year . The Scriptures inform us that circumcision was given to their father Ishmael at that age , and this custom still prevails among the Mohammedans . Other Arab nations commemorate Abraham and Hagar , and they are the peoples the Scriptures say issued from that marriage . This patriarch %%as a Chaldaean , and those people , famed for their astronomical observations , have considered Abraham one of their most learned astronomers . The Syrian historians have made him king of Damascus , though he was a foreigner and came from the neighborhood of Babylon ; and they tell how he left the kingdom of Damascus in order to settle in the country of the Canaanites , afterward called Judaea . But it is better to observe what the history of God 's people tells us concerning this great man . We have seen that Abraham led the kind of life lived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reigned in his family and with them embraced that pastoral life so noted for its simplicity and innocence , rich in flocks , in slaves , and in money but without land and without domain ; he nonetheless lived in a foreign kingdom , respected and as independent as a prince . His piety and uprightness , which were protected by God , won him this respect . He negotiated as an equal with kings who sought to ally with him , giving rise to the ancient opinion which made him a king . Though his life was simple and peaceful , he knew how to make war , but only in defense of his oppressed allies . He defended them and avenged them in an important victory . He restored to them all their riches , recaptured from their enemies , keeping only the tithe , which he offered to God , and the portion that belonged to the auxiliary troops which he had led into battle . Moreover , after so great a service he refused presents from kings with unparalleled magnanimity and could not bear that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would owe nothing but to God , who protected him and whom alone he followed in perfect faith and obedience . Guided by that faith , he had left his native country to come into a land which God showed him . God , who had called him and rendered him worthy of the Covenant with him , concluded it upon the following conditions : He declared to him that he would be his God and the God of his children , that is , that he would be their protector and that they should serve him as the only God , Creator of heaven and earth . He promised him a land ( namely , that of Canaan ) which was to be a perpetual dwelling-place for his seed and the seat of religion . Now , Abraham had no children , and Sarah , his wife , was barren . God swore to him personally , and by his eternal truth , that from him and that woman should issue a nation that would equal the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea . But now comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations were running headlong into idolatry . God promised the holy patriarch that in him and his seed all those blind nations which had forgotten their Creator would be blessed , that is , recalled to the knowledge of him , where true blessing is to be found . This promise makes Abraham the father of all the faithful , and // his posterity is chosen to be the source from which the blessing is to extend to all the earth . In this promise was included the coming of the Messiah , so often foretold to our fathers , but who was always spoken of as him who was to be the Savior of all the Gentiles and of all the nations of the world . Thus that blessed seed promised to Eve also became the seed and offspring of Abraham . Such is the foundation of the Covenant ; such are its conditions . As a token of it , Abraham was circumcised , a ceremony which was to signify that this holy man and his entire family belonged to God . Abraham was childless when God began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years . Later he had Ishmael , who was to be father of a great nation but not of the Chosen People , which had so often been promised to Abraham . The father of the Chosen People was to issue from him and his wife Sarah , who was barren . At length , thirteen years after Ishmael , that ardently wished-for child came : he was named Isaac , that is to say , laughter , a child of joy , a child of miracle , a child of promise , who shows by his birth that the true children of God are born of grace . The blessed child was already grown and of an age at which his father could expect other children by him , when suddenly God commanded him to sacrifice him . To what trials is faith exposed ! Abraham led Isaac to the mountain of which God had told him and was going to sacrifice that son through whom alone God promised to make him father both of his people and of the Messiah . Isaac bared his breast to the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , satisfied with the obedience of both father and son , asked no more of t hem . After these two great men had given the world so vivid and beautiful an image of the voluntary oblation of Jesus Christ and had tasted in spirit the bitterness of the Cross , they were judged truly worthy of being his ancestors . Because of Abraham 's faithfulness , ( ( ; od confirmed all his promises to him and again blessed not only his family but also , in his family , all the nations of the earth . And indeed , he continued to protect Isaac , his son , and Jacob , his grandson . They followed in his footsteps , adhering like him to the ancient faith , to the ancient pastoral way of life , and to the ancient government of mankind , where every father of a family was a prince // in his house . Thus , amid the changes daily occurring among men , the venerable old ways lived once more in the religion and the way of life of Abraham and his children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same promises he had made to Abraham ; and as he had called himself the God of Abraham , he took also the name of God of Isaac and God of Jacob . Under his protection these three great men began to dwell in the land of Canaan , but only as foreigners and without possessing one foot of land in it , until the famine drew Jacob into Egypt , where his children multiplied and soon became a great nation , as God had promised . Moreover , though that people whom God was causing to be born in his Covenant was to spread by procreation , and though the blessing was to follow the bloodline , that great God did not fail to give them signs of the election of grace . For , after having chosen Abraham from among the nations , among the children of Abraham he chose Isaac , and of Isaac 's twins he chose the younger , namely , Jacob , to whom he gave the name of Israel . The preference shown to Jacob was exemplified in the solemn blessing which he obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an express disposition of divine wisdom . This prophetic and mysterious deed had been prepared by an oracle as far back as the time when Rebecca , mother of Esau and Jacob , carried both in her womb . For this pious woman , disturbed by the struggle which she felt between the children in her womb , consulted God , from whom she received this answer : Two nations are in thy womb , and the elder shall serve the younger . As a fulfillment of that oracle , Jacob had received from his brother the surrender of his birthright , confirmed by an oath ; and when Isaac blessed Jacob , he merely put him in possession of the right which Heaven itself already had given him . The fact that God favored the Israelites , descendants of Jacob , over the Idumaean descendants of Esau , is foretold by this event . This event also foreshadows the future favor of the Gentiles , recently called to the Covenant by Jesus Christ , over the ancient people . Jacob had twelve children , who became the twelve patriarchs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter into the Covenant , but Judah was chosen from among all his brethren to be father of the // kings of Israel and father of the Messiah , so often promised to his ancestors . The time was to come when ten tribes would be cut off from God 's people because of their infidelity and when Abraham 's posterity would preserve its old blessing ? that is , its religion , the land of Canaan , and the hopes of the Messiah ? only in the tribe of Judah . This tribe would give its name to the rest of the Israelites , who were called Jews , as well as to the country itself , which was named Judaea . Thus the divine election can be seen at all times , even in that sensual people who were to be preserved by ordinary procreation . Jacob saw in his mind the secret of this election . When he was about to die and the children around his bed were craving the blessing of so good a father , God showed him the state of the twelve tribes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a few words , and those few words contain countless mysteries . Though all he says of Judah 's brethren is expressed with extraordinary dignity and bespeaks a man transported beyond himself by the spirit of God , yet when he comes to Judah , he rises still higher : Judah , he says , thou art he whom thy brethren praise : thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies : thy father 's children shall bow down before thee . Judah is a lion 's whelp : from the prey , my son , thou art gone up : he stooped down , he crouched as a lion , and as a lioness ; who shall rouse him up ? The scepter ( that is to say , authority ) shall not depart from Judah , and captains , magistrates , and judges born of his race shall be seen until the one who shall be sent shall come , who shall be the expectation of the peoples . According to another reading , which is , perhaps , no less ancient and which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes for whom things are reserved . The rest is as quoted . The rest of the prophecy describes to the letter the region which the tribe of Judah was to possess in the Holy Land . But the last words which we have seen , interpret them how we will , signify nothing else than him who was to be God 's envoy , the minister and interpreter of his will , the accomplishment of his promises , and the king of the new people , that is to say , the Messiah , or the Lord 's Anointed . Jacob speaks of him specifically only to Judah , from whom that Messiah was to issue ; he includes in the destiny of Judah alone the destiny of the whole nation , which , after its dispersion , was to see the remnant of the other tribes reunited under Judah 's banners . All the terms of the prophecy are clear : there is only the word scepter , which the usage of our language might make us interpret as royalty alone , while in the sacred language it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . This use of the word scepter is encountered in every page of the Scriptures ; it appears even explicitly in Jacob 's prophecy , and the patriarch means that in the days of the Messiah all authority would cease in the house of Judah , which implies the total overthrow of a state . Thus the days of the Messiah are indicated here by a double change . By the first , the kingdom of Judah and of the Jewish nation is threatened with its final ruin . By the second , there is to arise a new kingdom , not of one people but of all the nations , of whom the Messiah is to be the leader and the hope . In the style of the Scriptures , the Jewish people are referred to in the singular ( in particular as the people or God 's people ) ; and , when we find the peoples , those who are versed in the Scriptures understand that this means the other nations , who also had been promised to the Messiah in Jacob 's prophecy . That great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish people and of the Christ who is promised to them . It points out the whole history of God 's people , and its result still endures . But I do not intend to make you a commentary on it : you will have no need for that , since by simply observing the continued existence of God 's people you will see the meaning of the oracle unfold itself , and the events themselves shall interpret it . Chapter 3 MOSES , THE WRITTEN LAW , AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PROMISED LAND After Jacob 's death , God 's people sojourned in Egypt until the time of Moses ' mission , that is to say , about 200 years . // Thus 430 years passed before God gave his people the land he had promised them . He meant to accustom his elect to rely upon his promise , confident that it would be fulfilled sooner or later , and always within the time appointed by his eternal Providence . The iniquity of the Amorites , whose land and spoils he wanted to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Abraham , reached the height for which he was waiting in order to deliver them up to the harsh and pitiless vengeance he intended to bring down upon them by the hands of his Chosen People . His people had to be given time to multiply , so that they might be in a position to fill the land that was destined for them and to occupy it forcibly by exterminating its inhabitants , whom God had cursed . In Egypt he wanted them to live in harsh and unbearable bondage so that , when delivered by unheard-of wonders , they might love their Deliverer and eternally praise his mercies . Such was the order of God 's counsels , as he himself has revealed them to us , in order to teach us to fear him , to worship him , to love him , and to wait for him with faith and patience . When the time had come , he heard the cries of his people , cruelly afflicted by the Egyptians , and sent Moses to deliver his children from their tyranny . He reveals himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to any living man . He appears to him in a manner that is as glorious as it is reassuring ; and he declares to him that he is the one who is . All that is before him is but a shadow . I Am , says he , That I Am : being and perfection belong to me alone . He assumes a new name , which indicates that being and life are contained in him as in their source ; and it is under that great name God , terrible , mysterious , incommunicable , that he will henceforth be served . I shall not give you a detailed account of the plagues of Egypt , of the hardening of Pharaoh 's heart , of the passage of the Red Sea , or of the smoke , the lightning , the resounding trumpet , and the frightful noise noticed by the people on Mount Sinai . There God carved with his own hand , upon two stone tablets , the fundamental precepts of religion and society ; with a loud voice he dictated the rest to Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses was given orders to form a venerable assembly of seventy elders , which might // be called the senate of God 's people and the perpetual council of the nation . God appeared publicly and had his law announced in his presence with an astonishing demonstration of his majesty and his power . Until then God had given nothing in writing that could serve as a rule to man . The children of Abraham had only circumcision and the ceremonies which accompanied it as a token of the Covenant which God had made with that chosen race . They were distinguished by this token from the nations that worshiped false deities . Otherwise , they adhered to God 's Covenant because they remembered the promises made to their fathers , and they were known as a people who served the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . God was so strangely forgotten that it was necessary to distinguish him by the name of those who had worshiped him and whose declared protector he was . This great God no longer wished to leave to the mere memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was time to erect stronger barriers against idolatry , which was engulfing all mankind and extinguishing all traces of natural light . Ignorance and blindness had prodigiously increased since the days of Abraham . In his time and a little after , the knowledge of God was still alive in Palestine and Egypt . Melchizedek , king of Salem , was the priest of the most high God , who made heaven and earth . Abimelech , king of Gerara , and his successor of the same name , feared God , swore by his name , and admired his power . Pharaoh , king of Egypt , dreaded the threats of this great God . But in Moses ' time those nations had become perverted . The true God was no longer known in Egypt as the God of all the nations of the world but as the God of the Hebrews . Men worshiped even beasts and reptiles . Everything was God except God himself ; and the world , which God had made to show his power , seemed to have become a temple of idols . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices and passions ; nor must we be astonished at this , for there was no power more inescapable or tyrannical than the power of vice and passion . When man , accustomed as he was to think that everything powerful was divine , felt himself drawn to vice by an irresistible force , he easily came to believe that this force was outside him , and soon made it into a god . Thus it was that unchaste love had // so many altars and that horrid impurities began to be mingled with the sacrifices . Cruelty , too , became part of the sacrifices . Guilty man , racked with the sense of his wickedness and looking upon the deity as an enemy , thought he could not appease him with ordinary victims . He must shed human blood along with that of beasts ; blind terror drove fathers to offer up their children and to burn them to their gods instead of incense . These sacrifices were common even in the days of Moses , but they were only a part of the horrible iniquities of the Amorites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not peculiar to these peoples . It is well known that in all nations of the world , without exception , men have sacrificed their fellows , and there is not a place on the face of the earth where they have not made offerings to those dismal and dread deities whose implacable hatred for mankind required such victims . Amid so much ignorance , man finally reached the point of worshiping his own handiwork . He thought he could lodge the divine spirit in statues , and he so completely forgot that God had made him that , in his turn , he thought he could make a God . Who could believe it if experience did not show us that so stupid and brutal an error was not only the most universal but even the most inveterate and incorrigible among men ? Thus we must admit , to the shame of mankind , that the most important of truths , the truth which the world proclaims , the truth which strikes us so powerfully , was now the farthest from man 's sight . The tradition which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently close to them ? had they been attentive to it ? was ready to vanish away ; prodigious fables , as full of impiety as of extravagance , assumed its place . The moment had come when the truth , so ill kept in the memory of men , could no longer be preserved except in writing ; and since God had already resolved to make his people more virtuous by more specific and more numerous laws , he also resolved at the same time to give these laws in writing . Moses was called to do this work . That great man collected the histories of past ages , those of Adam , Noah , Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and Joseph ? or , rather , that of God himself and of his wondrous acts . He did not need to dig very deep for the traditions of his ancestors . // He was born a hundred years after Jacob 's death . The old men of his time might have conversed several years with that holy patriarch ; and the memory of Joseph , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kings of Egypt , was still fresh . The aggregate lifetime of three or four successive men reached back as far as Noah , who had seen Adam 's children and touched , as it were , the origin of things . Thus the ancient traditions of mankind and those of Abraham 's family were not hard to collect : the memory of them was still alive ; and we need not wonder that Moses , in his Genesis , speaks of things that happened in the first ages as certainties , of which there were still remarkable monuments , both in the neighboring nations and in the land of Canaan . While Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob had inhabited that land , they had erected monuments everywhere to the things that had befallen them . In that land one was still shown the places where these patriarchs had lived ; the wells they had dug in those dry countries to water their families and their flocks ; the mountains where they had sacrificed to God and on which he had appeared to them ; the stones they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tombs in which their blessed ashes rested . The memory of those great men was recent , not only in the whole country , but likewise throughout the East , where several famous nations have never forgotten that they developed from their race . Thus , when the Hebrew people entered the Promised Land , everything there extolled the memory of their ancestors ; cities , mountains , and the very stones there spoke of those wondrous men and of the astonishing visions by which God had confirmed them in the original and true faith . Those who are even a little acquainted with antiquity know how eagerly the early ages erected and preserved such monuments and how carefully their descendants kept alive the memory of the occasions on which they had been set up . This was one way of writing history . Later the stones were shaped and polished ; and , after pillars , statues took the place of the crude and solid masses erected in the earliest times . We even have good reasons for believing that , in the lineage in // which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times were also kept ; for men have always been concerned about this . At least , it is certain that songs were composed , which fathers taught to their children , and that these songs , which were sung at feasts and assemblies , perpetuated the memory of the most outstanding deeds of past ages . This gave birth to poetry , which in the course of time assumed several forms , the most ancient of which is still preserved in the odes and hymns used by all the ancients , and even at present by unlettered nations , to praise the deity and great men . The style of these canticles is bold , unusual , and yet natural in that it is suited to represent nature in its emotions , thus moving on in quick and impetuous sallies , free from the usual connectives which plain speech requires but at the same time enclosed in numerous cadences which add to its strength ; it is a style that surprises the ear , captures the imagination , moves the heart , and more easily imprints itself upon the memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which such songs were most in use was the people of God . Moses mentions a great many of them , referring to them by their first lines , because the people knew the rest . He composed two of this kind himself . The first sets before our eyes the triumphant passage through the Red Sea and the enemies of God 's people , some already drowned and others halfdead with fear . In the second , Moses shows up the people 's ingratitude by celebrating the goodness and wonders of God . The following ages imitated him . God and his wondrous works were the theme of the odes they composed . God inspired them himself , and in fact God 's people are the only ones to whom poetry came by inspiration . In this mystical language Jacob had expressed the oracles which contained his children 's destiny , so that each tribe might the more easily remember what concerned it and might learn to praise him who was as glorious in his predictions as he was faithful in their accomplishment . These , then , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moses , for preserving the memory of things past . That great man , instructed by all these means , and raised even higher by the Holy // Spirit , wrote the works of God with an exactitude and a simplicity which attract faith and admiration , not for him , but for God himself . To the things of the past , which contained the origin and ancient traditions of God 's people , he added the wonders which God had recently worked for their deliverance . For this , he gives the Israelites no other witness than their own eyes . Moses does not tell them things that have happened in impenetrable recesses and deep caves ; he does not speak vaguely ; he gives specific circumstances for everything , like a man who has no fear of being refuted . He founds all their laws and their whole constitution on the wonders they have seen . Those wonders were nothing less than nature changed suddenly , upon different occasions , for their deliverance and for the punishment of their enemies : the sea divided , the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gushing from rocks at the stroke of a rod , the heavens giving them a visible signal to direct their march , and other similar miracles which they saw for forty years . The people of Israel were no more intelligent or discerning than the other nations , who , being wholly given up to their senses , could not conceive of an invisible God . On the contrary , they were as vulgar and rebellious as any other people , or more so . But this God , though invisible by his nature , rendered himself so perceptible by continual miracles , and Moses inculcated these miracles so energetically , that at last these sensual people were willing to be touched by that pure idea of a God who made everything by his word ? a God who was pure spirit , reason , and intelligence . In this manner , while idolatry , so greatly increased since Abraham , covered the whole face of the earth , only the posterity of that patriarch was exempt from it . Their enemies bore witness to this , and nations in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with astonishment : There is no idol in Jacob , neither are there any superstitious omens ; there are no divinations , no spells : the people trust the Lord their God , whose power is invincible . In order to impress upon their minds the unity of God and the perfect uniformity he required in his worship , Moses often repeats that in the Promised Land this one God would choose one place as // the only one where feasts , sacrifices , and all public worship should be performed . In the meantime , until this desired place should be found , while the people wandered in the wilderness , Moses built the Tabernacle , a portable temple , where the children of Israel presented their petitions to the God who had created heaven and earth and who did not disdain , as it were , to journey with them and to be their guide . Upon this principle of religion , upon this sacred foundation , the whole Law was built : a Law holy , just , and good , wise , provident , and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sacred society of man with God . To these holy institutions , he added noble ceremonies , feasts which recalled the memory of the miracles by which the children of Israel had been delivered ; and , what no other lawgiver had ever presumed to do , he added specific assurances that all would go well with them as long as they lived in obedience to the Law , while their disobedience would be pursued with clear and inevitable vengeance . He must have been seconded by God to give such a foundation to his laws , and the result has shown that Moses did not speak on his own . As for the great number of rituals he established for the Hebrews : though they now may seem superfluous , they were necessary then in order to distinguish God 's people from other nations , and they served as a barrier to idolatry , for fear that idolatry would engulf the Chosen People along with all the rest . To maintain religion and all the traditions of God 's people among the twelve tribes , one was chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tithes and oblations , the care of the sacred things . Levi and his children are themselves consecrated to God as the tithe of all the people . Among the Levites , Aaron is chosen to be high priest , and the priesthood is made hereditary in his family . Thus the altars have their ministers , the Law its advocates , and the continued existence of God 's people is testified by the succession of its high priests , which goes on without interruption from Aaron , the first of them . But the excellent thing about this Law was that it prepared the way for one more august , less encumbered with ceremonies , and more productive of virtues . To keep the people in expectation of this Law , Moses assures them // of the coming of that great prophet who was to spring from Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . The Lord thy God , says he , will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me : Unto him ye shall hearken . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lawgiver ? who can he be but the Messiah , whose teachings were one day to rule and sanctify the universe ? The Christ was to be the first to form a new people , to whom he was to say , A new commandment I give unto you ; and again , If you love me , keep my commandments ; and , even more specifically , Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time : Thou shalt not kill ... But I say to you ? and so on , in the same style and with the same forcefulness . This , then , is the new prophet , like Moses and author of a new Law , of whom Moses likewise says , in announcing his coming : Unto him ye shall hearken ; and it is to accomplish this promise that God , sending his Son , makes that divine voice echo on high like a peal of thunder : This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased : hear ye him . It was this prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he erected in the desert . The bite of the ancient serpent , which had spread among all mankind the poison from which we all perish , was to be healed by looking at him , that is , by believing in him , as he himself explains . But why refer here only to the brazen serpent ? The whole Mosaic Law , with all its sacrifices , the high priest whom he establishes with so many mysterious ceremonies , his entrance into the sanctuary , in a word , all the sacred rites of the Jewish religion , where everything was purified with blood , the very lamb immolated at the principal solemn ceremony , that is , at Passover , in memory of the deliverance of the people ? all this meant nothing but Christ , Savior by his blood of all God 's people . Until he should come , Moses was to be read at all meetings as the sole legislator ; and so , * until the time of the Messiah , the people at all times and in all difficulties rely upon Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numa , and the Twelve Tables ; as Athens had recourse to those of Solon ; as Lacedaemon preserved // and respected those of Lycurgus ; so the Hebrew people continually cited those of Moses . And , indeed , so well had the lawgiver regulated everything that there was never any need to make the least alteration in them . That is why the body of Jewish Law is not a collection of different statutes made at different times and occasions . Moses , enlightened by the Spirit of God , had foreseen everything . We see no laws of David , Solomon , Jehoshaphat , or Ezekiel , though all were very zealous for justice . Good princes needed only to enforce the Mosaic Law , and they contented themselves with recommending the observance of it to their successors . The people looked with horror upon any attempt to add or to take away from it one single article . They needed the Law at every moment to regulate not only the holy days , sacrifices , and ceremonies but also all other public and private actions , trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fashion of their dress , and , in general , everything relating to morality . There were no other books in which to study the precepts of a good life . They were to peruse it and meditate upon it night and day ; to collect maxims from it and to have them always before their eyes . It was here that the children learned to read . The only rule of education given to their parents was to teach their children that holy Law , to inculcate it in them , to make them follow it , since it alone could make them wise from childhood on . Thus it was to be made available to everybody . Besides the constant reading which everyone was obliged to give it in private , every seventh year , during the solemn year of remission and rest , it was read publicly and , as it were , promulgated anew at the Feast of Tabernacles , at which all the people assembled for eight days . Moses caused the original of Deuteronomy to be deposited beside the Ark. * But for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time through the malice or negligence of men , besides the copies which circulated among the people , authentic transcripts of it were made , which , being carefully revised and kept by the priests and Levites , were used instead of originals . The kings ( for Moses had well foreseen that this people would at length have kings , like all other nations ) ? the kings , I say , were obliged , by a specific law of Deuteronomy , to receive from the hands of the priests one of those transcripts thus religiously corrected , that they might copy it and read it all the days of their life . // The copies so revised by public authority were held in special veneration by all the people : they regarded them as proceeding immediately from the hands of Moses , as pure and complete as God had dictated them to him . An ancient volume , which was strictly and religiously correct , was found in the house of the Lord during the reign of Josiah . Perhaps it was the original itself , which Moses had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that saintly king and also proved an occasion for bringing that people to repentance . The great results achieved in all ages by the public reading of this Law are innumerable . In a word , it was a perfect book , which , being joined by Moses to the history of God 's people , taught them at once their origin , their religion , their institutions , their morals , their philosophy , everything that tends to regulate life , everything that unites and forms society , good and bad examples , the reward of the former and the severe punishments of the latter . By this admirable discipline , a people newly freed from slavery and kept forty years in a desert , arrives fully formed in the land it is to possess . Moses conducts it to the entrance ; and , being warned of his approaching end , he entrusts to Joshua what remains to be done . But before he died , he composed that long and admirable song which begins with these words : Give ear , 0 ye heavens , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mouth . In this silence of all nature , he at first speaks to the people with inimitable strength and , foreseeing their infidelity , shows them what horrors it will bring . But suddenly he goes beyond himself , as if all human language were beneath so grand a subject ; he relates what God said , and makes him speak with so much majesty and so much goodness that it is hard to say what he inspires most , awe and confusion , or love and confidence . All the people learned that divine song by heart by God 's and Moses ' orders . And then that great man died content , as a man who had forgotten nothing that could preserve among his followers the memory of God 's kindness and commands . He left his own children lost amid the multitude of their countrymen , without any social distinctions and without any special provisions . He has been admired not only by his own people but by all the nations of the world ; and no lawgiver has ever had so great a name among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Law and // all other sacred writers have taken pride in being his disciples . Indeed , he speaks like a master . In his writings one notices a very distinctive quality and a certain originality found in no other writing . In his simplicity , Moses strikes a note so sublime and majestic that nothing can equal it . In the case of other prophets , we feel that we hear men inspired by God ; but in the voice and the writings of Moses , we feel that we hear God himself . Some think that he wrote the Book of Job . The sublime quality of the thoughts and the majesty of the style make that history worthy of Moses . For fear that the Hebrews would become overly proud and would attribute God 's grace to themselves only , it was proper to let them know that this great God had his elect even in the race of Esau . What teaching was more important ? What more useful subject for consideration could Moses give to the afflicted people in the wilderness than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hands of Satan to be tried by all manner of hardships , sees himself deprived of his possessions , his children , and every earthly comfort ; immediately afterward , smitten with a loathsome disease and distracted inwardly by the temptation of blasphemy and despair , he nevertheless shows by his steadfastness that a faithful soul supported by divine aid , amid the most dreadful trials and in spite of the gloomiest thoughts the evil spirit can suggest , can not only preserve an invincible confidence but can even raise itself by its own calamities to the highest contemplation and can acknowledge , in the troubles it endures , the nothingness of man and the supreme dominion and infinite wisdom of God . Such are the lessons taught in the Book of Job . In keeping with these times , we see the holy man 's faith crowned with temporal prosperity : yet the people of God learn to know the virtue of suffering and to anticipate the grace that was one day to be attached to the Cross . Moses had felt that grace by anticipation when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than enjoy the pleasures and plenty of the house of the king of Egypt . From that time on God caused him to feel the opprobrium heaped on Jesus Christ . He felt it even more in his precipitous flight and in his forty years of exile . But he drained the cup of Jesus Christ to the last when , being chosen to deliver that people , he had to bear with its continual revolts , in which his life was often in danger . He learned the price of saving the // children of God and prefigured what a higher deliverance was one day to cost the Savior of the world . That great man had not even the consolation of entering the Promised Land . He beheld it only from a mountain top and was not at all ashamed to record that he was excluded from it by a sin of incredulity , which , slight as it appears , deserved to be so severely punished in a man who was endowed with so great a portion of grace . Moses served as an example of God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful strictness upon those whom his gifts bind to a more perfect fidelity . But a higher mystery is set forth to us in Moses ' exclusion . This wise lawgiver , who , through so many wonders , leads the children of God into only the neighborhood of their land , is himself a proof to us that his Law made nothing perfect and that , unable to give the accomplishment of the promises , it makes us see them afar off or conducts us at most , as it were , to the gateway of our inheritance . It is a Joshua , it is a Jesus ( for this was the true name of Joshua , who by that name and by his office represented the Savior of the world ) ? it is that man , so far inferior to Moses in everything and superior to him only by the name he bears , it is he , I say , who is to bring God 's people into the Holy Land . By the victories of that great man , before whom the Jordan turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sun stands still in the midst of heaven , God establishes his children in the land of Canaan , from which he by the same means drives out the abominable nations . The hatred for these people which he inspired in his faithful kept them far away from their impiety ; the punishment he inflicted on these nations at the hands of his Chosen People filled them with an awe of the divine justice whose decrees they were carrying out . One part of those nations , whom Joshua expelled from their land , settled in Africa , where an ancient inscription was found long after , commemorating their flight and the victories of Joshua . After those miraculous victories had put the Israelites in possession of the greater part of the land promised to their fathers , Joshua and Eleazar , the high priest , with the heads of the twelve tribes , divided it among them , according to the Law of Moses , and assigned to the tribe of Judah the first and greatest share . In the days of Moses this tribe had surpassed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joshua died , and the people continued the conquest of the Holy Land . God wanted the tribe of Judah to be the leader and declared that he had delivered the country into its hands . Indeed , that tribe defeated the Canaanites and took Jerusalem , which was to be the Holy City and the capital of God 's people . This was the ancient Salem , where Melchizedek had reigned at the time of Abraham , that king of justice ( for so his name imports ) and , at the same time , king of peace , since Salem signifies peace . Abraham had acknowledged him as the greatest high priest in the world , as if Jerusalem had even then been destined to be a holy city and the fountainhead of religion . That city was given at first to the children of Benjamin . As they were weak and few in number , they were unable to drive out the Jebusites , the ancient inhabitants of the country , and so lived among them . Under the judges , the people of God are dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . After the death of the old men , who had seen the miracles of God 's hands , the memory of those great works fades away and the universal tendency of mankind draws the people to idolatry . Each time they succumb to it , they are punished ; whenever they repent , they are delivered . Faith in Providence and in the truth of the promises and threats of Moses is gradually becoming firmer in the hearts of the true believers . But God was preparing still greater examples of it . The people demanded a king , and God gave them Saul , who was soon censured for his sins . He resolved at last to establish a royal family from which the Messiah should issue , and this he chose in Judah . David , a young shepherd , sprung from that tribe , the youngest of the sons of Jesse , whose merit his father and family did not realize but whom God found after his own heart , was anointed by Samuel in Bethlehem , his native city . Chapter 4 DAVID , SOLOMON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people assume a more august form . The kingdom is established in the house of David . This house begins with two kings // of different character , but both admirable . David , a warlike conqueror , subdues the enemies of God 's people , whose arms he causes to be feared throughout the East ; and Solomon , renowned for his wisdom both at home and abroad , makes his people happy by a profound peace . But here the history of religion requires some particular remarks upon the lives of those two great kings . David reigned first over Judah , powerful and victorious , and afterward was acknowledged by all Israel . He took from the Jebusites the stronghold of Zion , which was the citadel of Jerusalem . Master of that city , he established there , by God 's order , the seat of the kingdom and of religion . Zion was his dwelling place : he built a city around it and named it the City of David . Joab , his sister 's son , built the rest of the city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied the whole country , and the tribe of Benjamin , few in number , dwelled intermingled with them . The Ark of the Covenant , built by Moses , where God dwelled between the cherubim and where the two Tablets of the Law were kept , had at that time no fixed place . David brought it in triumph to Zion , which he had conquered with the almighty aid of God , that God might reign in Zion and be acknowledged there as the protector of David , of Jerusalem , and of the whole kingdom . But the Tabernacle , in which the people had served God in the wilderness , was still at Gibeon , and it was there that the sacrifices were offered on the altar which Moses had set up . But it was to remain there only until such a time as there should be a temple in which the altar could be reunited with the Ark and in which the whole worship service could be performed . When David had defeated all his enemies and had advanced the conquests of God 's people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and victory , he turned all his thoughts toward the establishment of divine worship ; and upon the same mountain where Abraham , ready to offer up his only son , was stayed by an angel 's hand , he marked out the place God had designated for the Temple . He drew all the plans for it ; he collected rich and precious materials for it ; he dedicated the spoils of the conquered nations and kings to its use . But this Temple , which was to be prepared by the conqueror , was to be erected by the peaceful prince . Solomon // built it on the model of the Tabernacle . The altar of burnt offerings , the altar of perfumes , the golden candlestick , the tables of shewbread , and all the rest of the sacred furnishings of the Temple were patterned after similar objects which Moses had had made in the wilderness ; Solomon added nothing but magnificence and grandeur . The Ark which the man of God had built was placed in the Holy of Holies , an inaccessible place , symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to men until Jesus Christ had opened an entrance into it by his blood . On the day of the dedication of the Temple , God appeared there in his majesty . He chose that place to establish his name and his worship , and it was forbidden to sacrifice elsewhere . God 's unity was demonstrated by the unity of his Temple . Jerusalem became a holy city , an image of the Church , where God was to dwell as in his true temple , and of Heaven , where he will make us eternally happy by the manifestation of his glory . After Solomon had built the Temple , he also built the palace of the kings , the architecture of which was worthy of so great a prince . His pleasure house , which was called the House of the Forest of Lebanon , was equally stately and delightful . The palace he reared for the queen was a new ornament to Jerusalem . Everything was vast in those edifices : the halls , the vestibules , the galleries , the walks , the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . Cedar was the only wood he used in these works . Everything was resplendent with gold and precious stones . Citizens and foreigners all admired the majesty of the kings of Israel . Everything else corresponded to this magnificence : the cities , arsenals , horses , chariots , and the prince 's guard . Commerce , navigation , law and order , together with a profound peace , rendered Jerusalem the richest city of the East . The kingdom enjoyed peace and plenty ; and everything in it reflected the glory of Heaven . David 's wars showed how much toil it takes to attain that glory , and Solomon 's reign showed how peaceable is its enjoyment . Moreover , the exaltation of those two great kings and of the royal family was the result of a special selection . David himself praises the wonder of that selection in these words : God hath chosen Judah to be the ruler ; and of the house of Judah the house of my father ; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for the Lord hath given me many sons ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord over Israel . This divine election had a higher aim than at first appears . The Messiah , who was so often promised as the son of Abraham , was also to be the son of David and of all the kings of Judah . It was with an eye to the Messiah that God promised David he would establish the throne of his kingdom forever . Solomon , chosen to succeed him , was destined to represent the person of the Messiah . And therefore God says to him , He shall be my son , and I will be his father , a thing he never said so emphatically of any other king or any other man . Thus in David 's time , and under his royal offspring , the mystery of the Messiah becomes clearer than ever in glorious prophecies that are brighter than the sun . David had seen him from afar and had sung of him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often , when he meant only to praise the glory of his son Solomon , he was suddenly carried beyond himself and transported far beyond that subject , seeing him who is greater than Solomon in glory as well as in wisdom . The Messiah appeared to him seated on a throne more lasting than the sun and the moon . He saw at his feet all nations , subdued , and at the same time blessed in him , in fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham . He raised his vision still higher ; he saw him in the brightness of the saints and before the daystar , proceeding eternally from the bosom of his Father , a priest forever , and without successor , succeeding nobody , created in an extraordinary manner , not according to the order of Aaron , but according to the order of Melchizedek , a new order which the Law did not know . He saw him sitting at the right hand of God , beholding from the highest heavens his enemies made his footstool . He is astonished at so grand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son , he calls him his Lord . He saw him as God , whom God had anointed to make him reign over all the earth by truth , meekness , and justice . He was present in spirit at the council of God and heard from the eternal Father 's own mouth that expression which he addresses to his only Son : This day have I begotten thee ; to which God adds a promise of perpetual
