txt Letters ELIZABETH EISNER New Providence , N.J.MARIO PEI Glen Ridge , N.J. Letters Think small Hooray for Roger Starr 's article in praise of " Making New York smaller " ( Nov. 14 ) ! We loved our years in New York but yielded to a very amenable suburban area after realizing that a city that unrealistically allots most of its resources to welfare , housing and medical care for the poor has no hope of being decent for the middleclass resident . In the long-run , it would be kinder for New York to press on with family planning for the poor , to remove old , blighted housing so as not to attract more people it can house only poorly but not employ or educate , and to gradually increase its green areas . A smaller dependent population is the first step to building a healthier city . ELIZABETH ELSNER New Providence , N. .1 . Reverse gear There is a more humane alternative to Professor Starr 's solution for New York 's economic plight ; one that would apply not only to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one that would in no way infringe upon the right of the individual not to he forcibly relocated . That is to put into reverse the process whereby the inner cities were created , a process that began immediately after and even during World War II . At that time , the generosity of big-city politicians ( at the taxpayers ' expense , and not always inspired by altruistic motives ) drew to cities and states like New York vast numbers of welfare recipients who found it more expedient to live on $100 a week in New York than on $10 a week in less affluent states ( and who could blame them ? ) . Their influx was a prime cause of migration to the suburbs of taxpayers who grew tired of exorbitant taxation plus neighborhood deterioration and added security risks . If the Federal Government would assume the total wel. fare burden , on a reasonably generous basis but with payments equalized throughout the nation ( like Social Security ) , and with prohibition to the states and local governments to make additional wel , fare contributions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , of their own accord and without any compulsion , move back to their areas of origin ( where many still have roots ) , or to other rural and semirural areas where living costs are lower , the climate and environment more healthful and life conditions generally easier and safer . We have seen this happen in the case of many recipients of Social Security , whose dollar income goes much farther in Florida or Arizona than it does in New York . The active and gainfully employed , on the other hand , would find it better to stay in the cities where their sources of livelihood are located . There they would probably be joined by a good many of those who reluctantly moved out to the suburbs but whose hearts remained in the cities where they were horn and raised . This would lead to renewed and profitable reconstruction of nowdesolate areas , and to rebirth and sound expansion for the cities . MARIO PEI Glen Ridge , N.J. Agri-Bronx ? Why not raze those blighted blocks in the South Bronx and put them into wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And no one will mug or rape a stalk . The farmlands can he taxed . Labor is plentiful . No forced relocation will be necessary . Pollution will be erased . All that is needed is " seed money . " DORIS DIJHL Malverne , N.J. Save the people Roger Starr , in his obsession with " Making New York smaller , " offers a simplistic solution . He fails to see the city in terms of its entire urban area  --  a city of 16 mil . lion , not seven-and-a-half . The effects of the people living in the suburbs are as damaging as those of people living in the ghettos . Without a regional perspective , a smaller New York will be as ineffective as a smaller Newark has been . He gives the impression that the South Bronx and other troubled neighborhoods are nearly empty of people receiving a huge chunk of the city 's income ; while in fact the population is from one to two million , often receiving too few services to even survive . It is a population with nowhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship them to camps in the country ? The areas that actually had but a // . Further reproduction prohibited without permission . Letters // few buildings standing were , with few exceptions , bulldozed into the piles of rubble Mr. Starr so admires , without benefit to anyone . His plan is in fact the same as the Manhattantown Urban Renewal Project on the Upper West Side and the equally devastating Brownsville Housing in Brooklyn , except the housing is to he elsewhere . Are we once again to have good neighborhoods collapse because of increased destruction in the had ? The people who would gain from Starr 's proposal are the real-estate interests he knows so well , not the citizens of the city . It is a proposal based on the exclusive considerations of fiscal financing , not nn the de . tailed planning based on each sector of our economy and on a careful examination of the neighborhoods we have , and the people , that is so desperately needed . NATI IAN WHITING Brooklyn , N.Y . The author replies : One of the persistent New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good for real-estate investors . I can not understand what leads Mr. Whiting to believe that the owners of the abandoned buildings in this city somehow benefit from the thestruction of their property . Nor do I understand why he should think that I advocate that the city should lose jobs and population . The job loss is with us now , much though we may deplore it . The population loss is following and , in my view , will continue to follow . I suggested that the survival of the city 's services depends on our recognizing and compensating for the impact of wealth and population shrinkage on the ability Of the city to deliver those services . Mr. Whiting suggests that New York 's problems can not be solved without reference to the problems of this region . lie should go further . New York is helpless without a thriving national economy , but even with general prospurity , New York requires special attention . In 1598 , its old central cities incorporated their then suburbs of Rich . mond , Queens and the outei Bronx and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlast re , gionalization , I believe . " Where do the rooks go ? " Roger Starr 's " Cambodian " solution to New York 's problems reminds me of the Earl of Lucan during the Irish famine when he pulled down the houses of his starving tenants so as to get them off his land . When asked where they would go , he replied : " When you cut down the trees , where do the rooks go ? " Mr. Starr owes us a more precise answer than , as he suggests , letting , the land lie fallow . Does he propose destroying more agricultural land and greenery to make way for new development ? Or putting the displaced persons into the Sun Belt . drawing down the water table even faster than now , and thus turn the land into a desert ? JOHN E. ULLMANN Professor of Management , Hotstra University Hempstead , N. Y. Bureaucratic horror ? Despite Mr. Starr 's reputation as a bureaucrat par excellence , I ant forced to wonder if he has considered the bureaucratic horror which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is difficult enough for the Department of Social Services to relocate even one family into a new dwelling , let alone the thousands more who would need such service under the terms of his proposal ( especially with a chronically low vacancy rate . ) . The likelihood that a new planned-shrinkage bureaucracy might effectively consume all the supposed savings from Mr. Starr 's proposal was not mentioned in his article . : 5TEVEN nA-1L New York City " Personal City " When Mr. Starr says mat Westway would " put thousands of idle New Yorkers to work , " he fails to add that improvements in mass rail transit will also provide jobs here  --  more than Westway , in fact , because local construction firms are n't especially geared to building superhighways and the fattest contracts would probably go to out-of-town bidders who have the know how and equipment ready to deliver . Second , his assumption that substantial Federal aid to New York City would he re ? girded in Washington as " a reward for profligacy " calls to // Letters // mind the Calvinist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have erred , they did so in trying to create the most humane society On earth . Can a Government that has squandered many more billions in laying Southeast Asia to waste now logically deny that prodigal son at least a slice of the fatted calf ? I truly hope not . Third . in his delineation of the Economic City and the Political City . Mr. Starr overlooks perhaps the most important city , the Personal City : The thousands of private citizens who have organized to upgrade their neighborhoods and provide  --  mostly out of their own pockets  --  many of the services the city can no longer afford , thus broadening its tax base while reducing its expenses . The Personal City attests to New York 's unfailing sound health and will play a key role in its future . JACK MESEROLE New York City Forgiving transgressors Irving Kristol 's " PostWatergate morality : Too good for our good ? ' ( Nov. 14 ) employs the old sophistries . Then : " Distinguished men and women are increasingly reluctant to enter politics . The slightest transgression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaves their reputations stained forever . " The key phrase here is " the slightest transgression . " The ordinary citizen is not permitted the slightest transgression as he goes about his daily chores , hut then justice is not for the ordinary citizen . Why should n't public officials he expected to he above reproach ? Is n't that what is implicit when they aspire to public office ? Until we get that kind of morality , this country will continue to be the captive of special interests . HELENA WF.ICHERT Clinton Corners , N.Y .  - -  - Cheap cop-out ? irving xristoes critique or our post-Watergate morality may intend to help us achieve a more realistic moral stance bal , alas , he ends up with a typical justification for Watergate immorality : You ca n't he good and survive . For example , Kristol says he is against bribery personally , and we may not want to sell arms to foreign countries but " in the end , and inevitably , we 'll have no choice but to sell these governments the armaments they wish to buy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits .. balance of trade at stake . " Granted there are great difficulties in the economics of weaponry , is Mr. Kristol suggesting that there are no other possible solutions to jobs , profit , trade , etc. other than selling arms abroad ? Or is he sneering at the predicted selfinterest of Congressmen , labor and business ? In either case . whoever said moral reform was easy , or that it did not involve change , or that obvious self-interest is the usual harrier to moral reform ? Giving in to difficulties in advance , picturing all attempts at moral reform as simplistic idealism is a cheap cop-out from at least trying some modest moral reforms . WILLIAM A. SPURRIER Redding , Professor of Ethics , Wesleyan University Middletown , Conn . " Crooks are crooks " What the hell do you mean by post-Watergate morality ? Is this some kind of newspeak ? Dammit . morality is morality , honesty is honesty and crooks are crooks . BARTON HICKMAN New York City Inching away There was a serious mistake in " The waves of the future ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exposure during the use of microwave ovens is considerably greater than the quoted statement of Dr. Moris Shore implies . It is highly simplistic and misleading to say that radiated energy decreases as the square of the distance increases . This is true only for point sources  --  i.e. , when the size of the source is considerably smaller than the distance involved . Obviously , radiation does not originate just from one point on the surface of the oven , especially since the wavelengths involved are in the order of several inches . Consequently , it is not trite that at a 20-inch distance Letters from that surface the intensity is 100 times less than at 2 inches . The actual level would depend on the radiation pattern but , in any case , it would he much greater than Dr. Shore 's statement implies . For example : If microwaves were to leak all around the edges of a 10- by-15-inch door ( or through the surface ) with about equal intensity , the energy intensity at 20 inches would he only slightly less than at 2 inches ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City The author replies : Dr. Moris L. Shore , who is director of the division of biological effects at the Food and Drug Administration 's Bureau of Radiological Health , says : " I must disagree with Mr. Mandey that my remark was ' a serious mistake ' or ' a highly simplistic and misleading ' statement . " His statement that inverse square reduction of power density with distance is typical of sources small with respect to the distance in question is , of course , generally true , hut the conclusion he draws from this is not applicable in the case of present household microwave ovens for two reasons . " First , it generally is the case that when a microwave oven emits radiation approaching the limit in our standard he source is geometrically small , typically a slot a few centimeters long at most . We have not seen his hypothetical ase of an oven which leaks significantly all around the edges of the door . " Secondly , within a few centimeters of the ovens surface there are evanescent , or nonradiating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an electricfield-sensing instrument and are included in our tests of compliance . These do not have significant magnitude at greater distances and t hus increase the factor of decrease in measured power density with increasing distance . " In the laboratories of our division of electronic products , a slot approximately seven centimeters long is used to simulate microwave oven leakage for purposes of instrument evaluation . At 2,450 megahertz , the power density emitted by this slot , as measured by an electric-field-sensing microwave power density meter , decreases by exactly the inverse square of the distance between five and 25 centimeters , and should continue to do so at greater distances . " We believe this hehaviorto be typical of the leakage from present-day microwave ovens and , in light of this , my informal estimate that power density at 20 inches would be 100 times less than at two two inches is sound .

Nov. 14 ) portrays dormitory cooking at the State University of New York ( SUNY ) at Stony Brook as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find it so , others of us derive no satisfaction from the experience . Measuring the popularity of dorm cooking against that of the campus food service is not a meaningful test . Many people would rather drive to a delicatessen or restaurant off campus than risk the bad school food service . While in some dorms the " million-dollar program " means adequate cooking and cleanup facilities , Stage XII ( the graduate students ' dorm ) hail too few stoves installed , and for a long time all cleaning up had to be done in bathroom sinks ( this may still he the case . for all we know ) . It has been our experience that even where adequate cleanup facilities are provided . the cooking arras quickly become unspeakably filthy . The fact that this is primarily the fault of our fellow students is no comfort when one is chasing away cockroaches or scraping off someone else 's old spaghetti sauce . Woks are surely fun and easy , hut their increasing use will only make the sanitation problem worse . We who are free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of it .
