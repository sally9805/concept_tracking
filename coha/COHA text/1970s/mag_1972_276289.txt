Things were looking up last week for the nation 's two most important deficits : <P> &gt; The U.S. balance of payments deficit in April was the lowest in nearly a year-little more than $100 million according to estimates by Alan Greenspan , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists . That figure was way down from $1.3 billion in March and $1.6 billion in February , let alone the $8.8 billion payments gap last August . The biggest boon last month was that more U.S. investment funds stayed home instead of seeking a higher return abroad . Some European interest rates have fallen lately . Meanwhile , short-term rates in the U.S. have risen as a result of growing loan demand and a somewhat tighter Federal Reserve monetary policy . Since February , rates of 91-day Treasury bills have climbed from 3.07% to 3.51% , and bank prime rates have gone from a low of 41% to as high as 51% . Short-term interest rates are likely to show a slow upturn for the rest of the year , which should continue to aid the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fiscal year will fall well short of the $38.8 billion projected by President Nixon last January . It will be anywhere from less than $30 billion to $32 billion . The overwithholding of income taxes ( TIME , Jan. 24 ) will reduce the deficit by $6 billion in fiscal 1972 . In addition , the President wanted to spend a lot of federal money in a hurry to help lift the economy , but Government agencies simply could not speed up payments and new orders that fast . Much of the spending that Nixon had hoped for this year will be delayed until fiscal 1973 , which begins in July . As a result , the fiscal 1973 deficit is likely to be higher than Nixon 's originally projected $25.5 billion . Economist Maurice Mann , formerly Nixon 's assistant budget chief , predicts that 1973 's deficit will " significantly exceed $30 billion . " That larger deficit should help the economy accelerate after midyear , but perhaps too much so , heightening the danger of renewed inflation .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
