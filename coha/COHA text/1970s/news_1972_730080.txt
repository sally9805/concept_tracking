txt The mysterious American " middleman " ? who President Nixon says is responsible for at least two-thirds of the soaring price tag of food costs ( which climbed at an annual orate of 22.4 percent in February ) ? in fact does n't always get two-thirds of the total at all . For every dollar you spend on beef , based on October to December , 1971 , U.S. Department of Agriculture figures , only . a little over one-third ? about 37 cents ? goes to the middleman . For a dollar 's worth of pork a little over half goes to the middleman . For oranges , however , its about 75 cents . For frying chickens over 50 cents . In fact , when one talks about middlemen , one is really referring to the hundreds of thousands of people  --  truckers ; feed lot operators ; railroad engineers , brakemen , and switchmen ; warehousemen ; butchers and grocery clerks  --  who make the enormously complicated $120 billion-a-year American food industry work . " That two-thirds figure used by the President is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food processing firm . " Mr. Nixon ca n't single out the farmers as villains or he 'll lose the farm vote . And so far he 's been afraid to bring large food chains under stiff price monitoring because he needs Republican business support . But there 's certainly no big packer or processor 's lobby in this country , so it 's safe  --  and expedient ? to blame the mysterious middleman. " // *Food middlemen beef at label of ' villain ' // Says W. E. Hamilton , director of research for the giant American Farm Bureau Federation , use of figures such as the two-thirds amount going to the middleman is " illusive . " " You can prove anything you want to prove by selecting the figures you need to support your contention . " Whatever the current overall share the middleman gets of the American food dollar as a whole ? which ran to about 60.3 percent in February , up from 59.9 percent in January ? middlemen in fact get diverse amounts of the food dollar depending on the specific food industry involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocery dollar , take what 's happening in the production and preparation of beef ? from hamburgers to more elaborate steak dinners . Rising beef costs are identified as perhaps the largest part of that February hike in meat prices . Beef margins slim In the beef industry , as mentioned , only about one-third of each dollar of steak you eat goes to the middleman . And at each step of the beef process , costs ( including labor , feeding , transportation , slaughtering , machinery , rent , and taxes ) are rising , while profit margins are extremely slim . For the farmer who raises the cattle in the first place there just is n't much profit at all . Overall farm expenses by February 14 , 1972 , according to the U.S. Agriculture Department , were 5 percent higher than the year earlier . One Osage County cattle rancher in the Blue Stem country of northwest Oklahoma , for example , made only about 2.74 percent profit on his $637,000 net investment recently . " I 'm finding that young people today just are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terrible cost , " says Gus McCaslin , a farm writer for the Tulsa Daily World and himself a farmer . Two Oklahoma State University agricultural extension specialists  --  Gale Thompson and Lade Hudgins  --  recently made a study of northeast Oklahoma farmers . Packer also squeezed Based on their findings , the production cost of a steer  --  from the cow-calf stage through the grower phase to and through the feed-lot stage ( when the steer is brought up to a typical 1,100 pounds weight  --  is about $350 . Yet prices at the packer level  --  where the steer is sold for slaughter  --  are running at about $35 a hundredweight in Oklahoma . So that averages out to about $385  --  a gain of perhaps $35 a steer . In many cases , it must be stressed , the feed-lot operator 's margin is far less . The packer who has purchased the steer for the $385 price , and will butcher it for the retailer , has himself had major cost increases of late . Labor expenses alone during the past 20 years , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some packing houses in fact are operating under capacity . " We 're running on about a 1 percent profit margin , " says one Oklahoma packer , who declines to be identified for fear of " government reprisals . " This man says that his labor-machinery costs have skyrocketed . Moreover , the retailer , he says , can pretty well control his sales price : " Ten years ago there were maybe 150 or so major retail buyers in this ? area . Now its done by maybe four or five major chains . That means tremendous leverage on the price bid , to us . " The packer sells the 1,100-pound steer to retailers . But after a weight reduction , the actual weight of the animal is about 693 pounds . Carcass prices during past months have ranged around $53 to $57 per hundredweight , depending on the region . That means a wholesale price of about $395 ? compared to the packer 's outlay of $385 . For the retailer only about 495 pounds of edible beef are left after trimming , which means about 79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholesale price and the sale price  --  running around $1.15 a pound for beef for February , 1972 ? there are soaring labor , transportation , and marketing costs . William Mitchell , president of Safeway Stores , Inc. , argues that supermarkets operate on a " hairline margin " between profit and loss and that the industry has an average net profit of about 0.9 percent on sales . U.S. action awaited For its part the Price Commission ? still committed to the administration 's goal of slowing price inflation to a maximum 2.5 percent annual rate ( instead of the now expected 3.5 to 4 percent rate by year end ) is known to be weighing the possibility of requiring retailers to list all price increases . The commission will shortly hold hearings on food prices . Whether Mr. Nixon will go beyond jawboning in checking soaring food prices ( such as Treasury Secretary John Connally 's recent well-publicized discussion with major grocery retailers ) and eventually bring raw agricultural products under the economic stabilization program is an open question . Such products are now exempt . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though urging certain exporting nations to volutarily hold export to the United States to about 10 percent above quotas . Some administration critics are urging both a total end to food import quotas and sale of surplus crops to ease pressure on food prices . More cattle on hand Moreover , as some items , such as beef become more available in the coming months retail prices are expected to follow a drop in farm prices . There are now about 8 percent more cattle in feeder lots than last year , and this increased supply could help reduce grocery checkout costs . One question , however , is whether a pickup in the economy will tend to boost family meat purchases and thus still aid the inflation spiral . And pork prices  --  which shot up 9.3 percent last month  --  might show a slight increase this summer . Despite the complexity of the nation 's massive food price problem , one fact seems clear , say some economists : ' Middleman " price increments  --  in the beef industry , at least  --  are piecemeal increments and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
