He is the grandson of a slave and the composer of seven operas , eight symphonies and close to a hundred other works . At 79 , with his name in all the right reference books , William Grant Still could justifiably lay claim to the title " dean of American black composers . " Except that he does not choose to . It is not that Still rejects his Negro heritage but that he feels his music has as many roots in Europe as it does in Africa . " If I have an ambition , " he says , " it is to be recognized as a composer . Just that . " <P> Still may get his wish some day . Right now he is going to have to settle for the benefits accruing to him as part of a revival of interest in serious black American music-as opposed to jazz and the blues . Within the past year the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has devoted a week-long festival to Still and other black composers . Columbia Records has issued the first four albums of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still 's Afro-American Symphony ( 1930 ) , a prismatically scored , blues-flavored gem and , incidentally , the first symphony ever written by a black American . Last week in Jackson , Miss. , the only professional black opera company in the U.S. , a 3-year-old group called Opera/South , presented the world premiere of Still 's 33-year-old opera A Bayou Legend . <P> That this opera could have been neglected for so many years testifies to the cruel , often mindless vagaries of musical fashion in the U.S. throughout the past generation or two . Legend is not a great work . It does not introduce any innovations in musical or dramatic style . It could in fact as easily have been written in 1910 as 1941 . It has the directness ( though not the genius ) of Verdi , the misty orchestral hues of Delius and a soulful melodic style that both Puccini and Sigmund Romberg might have liked . Given the longstanding American addiction to the new and different , how could any U.S. opera company take such a throwback seriously ? <P> Today , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as it once did . The reason lies partly in the same craving for nostalgia that in the pop world has brought back Scott Joplin and 1950s ' rock ' n ' roll . Mostly it seems to stem from a foundering of the musical avant-garde and a desire on the part of performers and audiences alike to reassess what was going on while the twelve-tone and electronic boys were holding sway in the academies . <P> In the case of Still , A Bayou Legend reveals him as a kind of American Grieg -a miniaturist gifted with melody , an unerring sense of color and a fondness for the folklore . Although the performers in Jackson were all black , Legend is not especially a black opera , as the composer and his librettist wife Verna Arvey are the first to point out . <P> The story is set in the bayous near Biloxi , not too far from Still 's birthplace in Woodville , Miss . The young Cajun Bazile falls in love with the spectral Aurore , defying the Cajun stricture against consorting with spirits as evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a love she can not understand , betrays her beloved to the village priest . Bazile is hanged . At the moment of his death , Bazile 's spirit is joined with that of Aurore.
