She lights one of the burners on the stove and starts cooking the bacon. ) p. 6 WESLEY ( as he throws wood into wheelbarrow ) I was lying there on my back . I could smell the avocado blossoms . I could hear the coyotes . I could hear stock cars squealing down the street . I could feel myself in my bed in my room in this house in this town in this state in this country .

Cobwebs moving with them . Dust laying on their wings . Decals peeling off their wings . My P-39 . My Messerschmitt . My Jap Zero . I could feel myself lying far below them on my bed like I was on the ocean and overhead they were on reconnaissance . Scouting me . Floating . Taking pictures of the enemy . Me , the enemy . I could feel the space around me like a big , black world . I listened like an animal . My listening was afraid . Afraid of sound . Tense . Like any second something could invade me . Some foreigner . Something undescribable . Then I heard the Packard coming up the hill . From a mile off I could tell it was the Packard by the sound of the valves . The lifters have a sound like nothing else . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Downshifting into second for the last pull up the hill . I could feel the headlights closing in . Cutting through the orchard . I could see the trees being lit one after the other by the lights , then going back to black . My heart was pounding . Just from my Dad coming back . Then I heard him pull the brake . Lights go off . Key 's turned off . Then a long silence . Him just sitting in the car . Just sitting . I picture him just sitting . What 's he doing ? Just sitting . Waiting to get out . Why 's he waiting to get out ? He 's plastered and ca n't move . He 's plastered and does n't want to move . He 's going to sleep there all night . He 's slept there before . He 's woken up with dew on the hood before . Freezing headache . Teeth covered with peanuts . Then I hear the door of the Packard open . A pop of metal . Dogs barking down the road .

Then , far off the freeway could be heard . ( WESLEY picks up one end of the wheelbarrow . He makes the sound of a car and pushes it off right , leaving ELLA alone at the stove watching the bacon . She speaks alone. ) p. 7 ELLA Now I know the first thing you 'll think is that you 've hurt yourself . That 's only natural . You 'll think that something drastic has gone wrong with your insides and that 's why you 're bleeding . That 's only a natural reaction . But I want you to know the truth . I want you to know all the facts before you go off and pick up a lot of lies . Now , the first thing is that you should never go swimming when that happens . It can cause you to bleed to death . The water draws it out of you . ( WESLEY 's sister , EMMA , enters from right . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club uniform . She carries several hand-painted charts on the correct way to cut up a frying chicken . She sets the charts down on the table upstage and arranges them as ELLA talks to her as though she 's just continuing the conversation . ) EMMA But what if I 'm invited ? The Thompsons have a new heated pool . You should see it , Ma . They even got blue lights around it at night . It 's really beautiful . Like a fancy hotel . ELLA ( tending to the bacon ) I said no swimming and that 's what I meant ! This thing is no joke . Your whole life is changing . You do n't want to live in ignorance do you ? EMMA No , Ma . ELLA All right then . The next thing is sanitary napkins . You do n't want to buy them out of any old machine in any old gas station bathroom . I know they say " sanitized " on the package but they 're a far cry from " sanitized . " They 're filthy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . You do n't know whose quarters go into those machines .

ELLA ( back to the bacon ) Well , I do n't know . I did n't make it up . Somebody called them napkins a long time ago and it just stuck . EMMA " Sanitary napkins . " ELLA Yes . EMMA It 's a funny sound . Like a hospital or something . ELLA Well that 's what they should be like , but unfortunately they 're not . They 're not hospital clean that 's for sure . And you should know that anything you stick up in there should be absolutely hospital clean . EMMA Stick up in where ? ( ELLA turns upstage toward EMMA , then changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA They 're for my demonstration . ELLA What demonstration ? EMMA How to cut up a frying chicken . ELLA ( back to bacon ) Oh . p. 9 EMMA For 4-H . You know . I 'm giving a demonstration at the fair . I told you before . I hope you have n't used up my last chicken . ( EMMA goes to refrigerator and looks inside for a chicken . ) ELLA I forgot you were doing that . I thought that was n't for months yet . EMMA I told you it was this month . The fair 's always this month . Every year it 's this month . ELLA I forgot . EMMA Where 's my chicken ? ELLA ( innocently ) What chicken ? EMMA I had a fryer in here all ready to go . I killed it and dressed it and everything ! ELLA It 's not in there . All we got is bacon and bread . EMMA I just stuck it in here yesterday , Ma ! You did n't use it did you ? ELLA Why would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I use a fryer for soup . Do n't be ridiculous . EMMA ( slamming refrigerator ) It 's not in there ! ELLA Do n't start screaming in here ! Go outside and scream if you 're going to scream ! ( EMMA storms off stage right . ELLA takes the bacon off the stove . Slight pause , then EMMA can be heard yelling off stage . ELLA puts some bread in the frying pan and starts frying it. ) p. 10 EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) That was my chicken and you fucking boiled it ! YOU BOILED MY CHICKEN ! I RAISED THAT CHICKEN FROM THE INCUBATOR TO THE GRAVE AND YOU BOILED IT LIKE IT WAS ANY OLD FROZEN HUNK OF FLESH ! YOU USED IT WITH NO CONSIDERATION FOR THE LABOR INVOLVED ! I HAD TO FEED THAT CHICKEN CRUSHED CORN EVERY MORNING FOR A YEAR ! I HAD TO CHANGE ITS WATER ! I HAD TO KILL IT WITH AN AX ! I HAD TO SPILL ITS GUTS OUT ! I HAD TO PLUCK EVERY FEATHER ON ITS BODY ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAKE IT AND BOIL IT ! ( WESLEY enters from left and crosses to center . ) WESLEY What 's all the screaming ? ELLA Somebody stole her chicken . WESLEY Stole it ? ELLA Boiled it . WESLEY You boiled it . ELLA I did n't know it was hers . WESLEY Did it have her name on it ? ELLA No , of course not . WESLEY Then she 's got nothing to scream about .

EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) EAT MY SOCKS ! p. 11 WESLEY ( crossing up to table ) Great language . ( noticing charts on table ) What 's all this stuff ? ELLA Her charts . She 's giving a demonstration . WESLEY ( holding one of the charts up ) A demonstration ? On what ? ELLA How to cut up a chicken . What else . ( ELLA takes her bacon and bread on a plate and crosses up to table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WESLEY Anybody knows how to cut up a chicken . ELLA Well , there 's special bones you have to crack . Special ways of doing it evidently . WESLEY ( turning downstage with chart held out in front of him ) What 's so special about it . ELLA ( eating at table ) The anatomy is what 's special . The anatomy of a chicken . If you know the anatomy you 're half-way home . WESLEY ( facing front , laying chart down on floor ) It 's just bones . EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) THERE 'S NO CONSIDERATION ! IF I 'D COME ACROSS A CHICKEN IN THE FREEZER I WOULD 'VE ASKED SOMEONE FIRST BEFORE I BOILED IT ! p. 12 ELLA ( yelling , still eating ) NOT IF YOU WERE STARVING ! ( WESLEY unzips his fly , takes out his pecker , and starts pissing all over the chart on the floor . ELLA just keeps eating at the table , not noticing . ) EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) NO ONE 'S STARVING IN THIS HOUSE ! YOU 'RE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) SO NO ONE 'S STARVING ! WE DO N'T BELONG TO THE STARVING CLASS ! ELLA Do n't speak unless you know what you 're speaking about ! There 's no such thing as a starving class ! EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) THERE IS SO ! THERE 'S A STARVING CLASS OF PEOPLE , AND WE 'RE NOT PART OF IT ! ELLA WE 'RE HUNGRY , AND THAT 'S STARVING ENOUGH FOR ME ! EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) YOU 'RE A SPOILED BRAT ! ELLA ( to WESLEY ) Did you hear what she called me ? ( she notices what he 's doing , she yells to EMMA ) EMMA ! EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) WHAT ! p. 13 ELLA YOUR BROTHER 'S PISSING ALL OVER YOUR CHARTS ! ( goes back to eating ) ( EMMA enters fast from right and watches WESLEY put his joint back in his pants and zip up . They stare at each other as ELLA goes on eating at the table . ) EMMA What kind of a family is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop him but he would n't listen . EMMA ( to WESLEY ) Do you know how long I worked on those charts ? I had to do research . I went to the library . I took out books . I spent hours . WESLEY It 's a stupid thing to spend your time on . EMMA I 'm leaving this house ! ( she exists right ) ELLA ( calling after her but staying at table ) YOU 'RE TOO YOUNG ! ( to WESLEY ) She 's too young to leave . It 's ridiculous . I ca n't say I blame her but she 's way too young . She 's only just now having her first period . WESLEY ( crossing to refrigerator ) Swell . ELLA Well , you do n't know what it 's like . It 's very tough . You do n't have to make things worse for her . p. 14 WESLEY ( opening refrigerator and staring into it ) I 'm not . I 'm opening up new possibilities for her . Now she 'll have to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'll look back and remember the day her brother pissed all over her charts and see that day as a turning point in her life . ELLA How do you figure ? WESLEY Well , she 's already decided to leave home . That 's a beginning . ELLA ( standing abruptly ) She 's too young to leave ! And get out of that refrigerator ! ( She crosses to refrigerator and slams the door shut . WESLEY crosses up to the table and sits at the stage right end . ) ELLA You 're always in the refrigerator ! WESLEY I 'm hungry . ELLA How can you be hungry all the time ? We 're not poor . We 're not rich but we 're not poor . WESLEY What are we then ? ELLA ( crossing back to table and sitting opposite WESLEY ) We 're somewhere in between . ( pause as ELLA starts to eat again ; WESLEY watches her ) We 're going to be rich though . p. 15 WESLEY What do you mean ? ELLA We 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ? ELLA Never mind . You just wait though . You 'll be very surprised . WESLEY I thought Dad got fired . ELLA He did . This has nothing to do with your father . WESLEY Well , you 're not working are you ? ELLA Just never mind . I 'll let you know when the time comes . And then we 'll get out of this place , once and for all . WESLEY Where are we going ? ELLA Europe maybe . Would n't you like to go to Europe ? WESLEY No . ELLA Why not ? WESLEY What 's in Europe ? ELLA They have everything in Europe . High art . Paintings . Castles . Buildings . Fancy food . WESLEY They got all that here . ELLA Why are n't you sensitive like your Grandfather was ? I always thought you were just like him , but you 're not , are you ? WESLEY No. p. 16 ELLA Why are n't you ? You 're circumcized just like him . It 's almost identical in fact . WESLEY How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both and I could see the similarity . WESLEY He 's dead . ELLA When he was alive is when I looked . Do n't be ridiculous . WESLEY What 'd you sneak into his room or something ? ELLA We lived in a small house . EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) WHERE 'S MY JODHPURS ! ELLA ( to WESLEY ) What 's she yelling about ? WESLEY Her jodhpurs . ELLA ( yelling to EMMA ) What do you need your jodhpurs for ? EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) I 'M TAKING THE HORSE ! ELLA DO N'T BE RIDICULOUS ! DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR YOU 'LL GET ON THAT HORSE ? NOT VERY FAR ! EMMA 'S VOICE ( off ) FAR ENOUGH !

( Pause . She looks at him . ) ELLA Well , maybe she 'll be all right . WESLEY Sure she will . She 's been out on overnight trail rides before . ELLA What a temper she 's got . WESLEY She 's just spoiled . ELLA No , she 's not . I never gave her a thing extra . Nothing . Bare minimums . That 's all . WESLEY The old man spoils her . ELLA He 's never around . How could he spoil her ? p. 18 WESLEY When he 's around he spoils her . ELLA That horse is a killer . I wish you 'd go down there and check . WESLEY She can handle him . ELLA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's an idiot ! They have to throw him down every time . WESLEY Look , where 's this money coming from ? ELLA What money ? WESLEY This money that 's going to make us rich . ELLA I 'm selling the house . ( Long pause , as WESLEY stares at her . She turns away from him . ) ELLA I 'm selling the house , the land , the orchard , the tractor , the stock . Everything . It all goes . WESLEY It 's not yours . ELLA It 's mine as much as his ! WESLEY You 're not telling him ? ELLA No ! I 'm not telling him and I should n't have told you . So just keep it under your hat . WESLEY How can you sell the house ? It 's not legal even . ELLA I signed the deed , same as him . We both signed it . p. 19 WESLEY Then he has to co-sign the sale . Fifty-fifty . ELLA I already checked with a lawyer , and it 's legal . WESLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and you 've borrowed money on it . ELLA Do n't start questioning me ! I 've gone through all the arrangements already . WESLEY With who ! ELLA I HAVE A LAWYER FRIEND ! WESLEY A lawyer friend ? ELLA Yes . He 's very successful . He 's handling everything for me . WESLEY You hired a lawyer ? ELLA I told you , he 's a friend . He 's doing it as a favor . WESLEY You 're not paying him ? ELLA He 's taking a percentage . A small percentage . WESLEY And you 're just going to split with the money without telling anybody ? ELLA I told you . That 's enough . You could come with me . WESLEY This is where I live . ELLA Some home . It does n't even have a front door now .

ELLA This land is valuable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot ? ELLA This is wonderful property for development . Do you know what land is selling for these days ? Have you got any idea ? WESLEY No . ELLA A lot . Tons . Thousands and thousands are being spent every day by ordinary people just on this very thing . Banks are loaning money right and left . Small family loans . People are building . Everyone wants a piece of land . It 's the only sure investment . It can never depreciate like a car or a washing machine . Land will double its value in ten years . In less than that . Land is going up every day . WESLEY You 're crazy . ELLA Why ? For not being a sucker ? Who takes care of this place ? WESLEY Me ! ELLA Ha ! Are you kidding ? What do you do ? Feed a few sheep . Disc the orchard once in a while . Irrigate . What else ? WESLEY I take care of it . ELLA I 'm not talking about maintenance .

WESLEY Nobody 's asking you to ! ELLA Nobody 's asking me period ! I 'm selling it , and that 's all there is to it ! ( Long pause , as they sit there . WESLEY gets up fast . ) ELLA Where are you going ? WESLEY I 'm gon na ' feed the sheep ! ( He exists left . ELLA calls after him . ) ELLA Check on Emma for me would you , Wesley ? I do n't like her being down there all alone . That horse is crazy . WESLEY 'S VOICE ( off ) HE 'S GOING TO KILL YOU WHEN HE FINDS OUT ! ELLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO FIND OUT ! ( pause , as she waits for a reply ; nothing ; she yells again ) THE ONLY PERSON HE 'S GOING TO KILL IS HIMSELF ! ( Another pause , as she stands there waiting for WESLEY to reply . Nothing . She turns to the table and stares at the plate . She picks up the plate and carries it to the stove . She sets it on the stove . She stares at the stove . She turns toward refrigerator and looks at it . She crosses to refrigerator and opens it . She looks inside. ) p. 22 ELLA Nothing . ( She closes refrigerator door . She stares at refrigerator . She talks to herself . ) ELLA He 's not going to kill me . I have every right to sell . Every right . He does n't have a leg to stand on .

She watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed me . ( ELLA shuts refrigerator and turns toward EMMA . ) ELLA What happened to you ? EMMA He dragged me clear across the corral . ELLA I told you not to play around with that fool horse . He 's insane , that horse . EMMA How am I ever going to get out of here ? ELLA You 're not going to get out of here . You 're too young . Now go and change your clothes . EMMA I 'm not too young to have babies , right ? ELLA What do you mean ? EMMA That 's what bleeding is , right ? That 's what bleeding 's for . p. 23 ELLA Do n't talk silly , and go change your uniform . EMMA This is the only one I 've got . ELLA Well , change into something else then . EMMA I ca n't stay here forever . ELLA Nobody 's staying here forever . We 're all leaving . EMMA We are ? ELLA Yes . We 're going to Europe . EMMA Who is ? ELLA All of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EMMA How come ? He 'd like it in Europe would n't he ? ELLA I do n't know . EMMA You mean just you , me , and Wes are going to Europe ? That sounds awful . ELLA Why ? What 's so awful about that ? It could be a vacation . EMMA It 'd be the same as it is here . ELLA No , it would n't ! We 'd be in Europe . A whole new place . EMMA But we 'd all be the same people . ELLA What 's the matter with you ? Why do you say things like that ? p. 24 EMMA Well , we would be . ELLA I do my best to try to make things right . To try to change things . To bring a little adventure into our lives and you go and reduce the whole thing to smithereens . EMMA We do n't have any money to go to Europe anyway . ELLA Go change your clothes ! EMMA No. ( she crosses to table and sits stage right end . ) ELLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . EMMA He 's not . ELLA Why ca n't you just cooperate ? EMMA Because it 's deadly . It leads to dying . ELLA You 're not old enough to talk like that . EMMA I was down there in the mud being dragged along . ELLA It 's your own fault . I told you not to go down there . EMMA Suddenly everything changed . I was n't the same person anymore . I was just a hunk of meat tied to a big animal . Being pulled . ELLA Maybe you 'll understand the danger now . EMMA I had the whole trip planned out in my head . I was going to head for Baja California . p. 25 ELLA Mexico ? EMMA I was going to work on fishing boats . Deep sea fishing . Helping businessmen haul in huge swordfish and barracuda . I was going to work my way along the coast , stopping at all the little towns , speaking Spanish . I was going to learn to be a mechanic and work on four-wheel-drive vehicles that broke down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I 'd learn how to be a short-order cook and write novels on the side . In the kitchen . Kitchen novels . Then I 'd get published and disappear into the heart of Mexico . Just like that guy . ELLA What guy ? EMMA That guy who wrote Treasure of Sierra Madre . ELLA When did you see that ? EMMA He had initials for a name . And he disappeared . Nobody knew where to send his royalties . He escaped . ELLA Snap out of it , Emma . You do n't have that kind of a background to do jobs like that . That 's not for you , that stuff . You can do beautiful embroidery ; why do you want to be a mechanic ? EMMA I like cars . I like travel . I like the idea of people breaking down and I 'm the only one who can help them get on the road again . It would be like being a magician . Just open up the hood and cast your magic spell . p. 26 ELLA What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was dreaming then . Right up to the point when I got the halter on . Then as soon as he took off I stopped . I stopped dreaming and saw myself being dragged through the mud . ELLA Go change your clothes . EMMA Stop saying that over and over as though by saying it you relieve yourself of responsibility . ELLA I ca n't even follow the way you talk to me anymore . EMMA That 's good . ELLA Why is that good ? EMMA Because if you could then that would mean that you understood me . ( Pause . ELLA turns and opens the refrigerator again and stares into it . ) EMMA Hungry ? ELLA No . EMMA Just habit ? ELLA What ? EMMA Opening and closing ? ( ELLA closes refrigerator and turns toward EMMA . ) ELLA Christ , Emma , what am I going to do with you ?

I do n't know where the money goes to but we 're not broke ! We 're not part of the starving class ! ( TAYLOR , the lawyer , enters from down right and watches EMMA as she speaks into refrigerator . He is dressed in a smart suit , middle-aged , with a briefcase . He just stands there watching her . ) EMMA ( into refrigerator ) Any corn muffins in there ? Hello ! Any produce ? Any rutabagas ? Any root vegetables ? Nothing ? It 's all right . You do n't have to be ashamed . I 've had worse . I 've had to take my lunch to school wrapped up in a Weber 's bread wrapper . That 's the worst . Worse than no lunch . So do n't feel bad !

TAYLOR Well , I 've got some business with your mother . EMMA You 're creepy . TAYLOR Oh , really ? EMMA Yeah , really . You give me the creeps . There 's something about you that 's weird . TAYLOR Well , I did come to speak to your mother . EMMA I know , but you 're speaking to me now . TAYLOR Yes . ( pause , as he looks around awkwardly ) Did someone break your door down ? EMMA My Dad . TAYLOR Accident ? EMMA No , he did it on purpose . He was pissed off . TAYLOR I see . He must have a terrible temper . EMMA What do you want ? TAYLOR I told you  --  EMMA Yeah , but what do you want my mother for ? TAYLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a business woman . She 's terrible at business . TAYLOR Why is that ? EMMA She 's a sucker . She 'll believe anything . TAYLOR She seems level-headed enough to me . EMMA Depends on what you 're using her for . ( Pause , as TAYLOR looks at her . ) TAYLOR You do n't have to be insulting . EMMA I got nothing to lose . TAYLOR You are her daughter , are n't you ? EMMA What line of business are you in ? TAYLOR Do you mind if I sit down ? EMMA I do n't mind . My Dad might mind , though . TAYLOR He 's not home , is he ? EMMA He might come home any second now . TAYLOR ( crossing to chair at table ) Well , I 'll just wait for your mother . EMMA He 's got a terrible temper . He almost killed one guy he caught her with . TAYLOR ( sitting in stage right chair ) You misunderstand me . I 'm here on business . p. 31 EMMA A short fuse they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just like him . And his father before him . Wesley is just like Pop , too . Like liquid dynamite . TAYLOR ( setting attach case on table ) Liquid dynamite ? EMMA Yeah . What 's that stuff called ? TAYLOR I do n't know . EMMA It 's chemical . It 's the same thing that makes him drink . Something in the blood . Hereditary . Highly explosive . TAYLOR Sounds dangerous . EMMA Yeah . TAYLOR Do n't you get afraid living in an environment like this ? EMMA No . The fear lies with the ones who carry the stuff in their blood , not the ones who do n't . I do n't have it in me . TAYLOR I see . EMMA Nitroglycerine . That 's what it 's called . Nitroglycerine . TAYLOR What do you mean ? EMMA In the blood . Nitroglycerine . TAYLOR Do you think you could call your mother for me ? EMMA ( yelling but looking straight at TAYLOR ) MOM ! ! ! p. 32 TAYLOR ( after pause ) Thank you . EMMA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting irritated ) I 've already told you ! EMMA Does she bleed ? TAYLOR What ? EMMA You know . Does she have blood coming out of her ? TAYLOR I do n't think I want to talk anymore . EMMA All right . ( EMMA crosses to table and sits opposite TAYLOR at the stage left end . She stares at him . They sit silently for a while . TAYLOR squirms nervously , taps on his attach case . EMMA just watches him . ) TAYLOR Marvelous house this is. ( pause , as she just looks at him ) The location I mean . The land is full of potential . ( pause ) Of course it 's a shame to see agriculture being slowly pushed into the background in deference to low-cost housing , but that 's simply a product of the times we live in . There 's simply more people on the planet these days . That 's all there is to it . Simple mathematics . More people demand more shelter . More shelter demands more land . It 's an equation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new people . We 're lucky to live in a country where that provision is possible . In some countries , like India for instance , it 's simply not possible . People live under banana leaves . ( WESLEY enters from right carrying a small collapsible fence structure . He sets it up center stage to form a small rectangular enclosure . He turns and looks at TAYLOR , then turns to EMMA. ) p. 33 WESLEY ( to EMMA ) Who 's he ? EMMA He 's a lawyer . ( TAYLOR stands , smiling broadly at WESLEY and extending his hand . WESLEY does n't shake but just looks at him . ) TAYLOR Taylor . You must be the son . WESLEY Yeah , I 'm the son . ( WESLEY exits right . TAYLOR sits down again . He smiles nervously at EMMA , who just stares at him . ) TAYLOR It 's a funny sensation . EMMA What ? TAYLOR I feel like I 'm on enemy territory . EMMA You are . TAYLOR I have n't felt this way since the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . WESLEY enters again from right carrying a small live lamb . He sets the lamb down inside the fenced area . He watches the lamb as it moves around inside the fence . ) EMMA ( to WESLEY ) What 's the matter with him ? WESLEY ( watching lamb ) Maggots . p. 34 EMMA Ca n't you keep him outside ? He 'll spread germs in here . WESLEY ( watching lamb ) You picked that up from Mom . EMMA Picked what up ? WESLEY Germs . The idea of germs . Invisible germs mysteriously floating around in the air . Anything 's a potential carrier . TAYLOR ( to WESLEY ) Well , it does seem that if the animal has maggots it should n't be in the kitchen . Near the food . WESLEY We have n't got any food . TAYLOR Oh . Well , when you do have food you prepare it in here , do n't you ? EMMA That 's nothing . My brother pisses on the floor in here . TAYLOR Do you always talk this way to strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . Right on my chart . WESLEY ( turning to TAYLOR ) What 're you doing here anyway ? TAYLOR I do n't feel I have to keep justifying myself all the time . I 'm here to meet your mother . WESLEY Are you the one who 's trying to sell the house ? p. 35 TAYLOR We 're negotiating , yes . EMMA ( standing ) What ? Trying to sell what house ? This house ? TAYLOR ( to EMMA ) Did n't she tell you ? WESLEY She told me . EMMA Where are we going to live ? WESLEY ( to EMMA ) You 're leaving home anyway . What do you care ? EMMA ( yelling off stage ) MOM ! ! ! TAYLOR ( to WESLEY ) I did n't mean to shock her or anything . WESLEY ( to TAYLOR ) Are n't you going to talk to my old man ? TAYLOR That 's not necessary right now . WESLEY He 'll never sell you know . TAYLOR Well , he may have to . According to your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? Who does he owe money to ? TAYLOR To everyone . He 's in hock up to his ears . EMMA He does n't owe a cent ! Everything 's paid for ! p. 36 WESLEY Emma , shut up ! Go change your clothes . EMMA You shut up ! This guy 's a creep , and he 's trying to sell us all down the river . He 's a total meatball ! WESLEY I know he 's a meatball ! Just shut up , will you ? EMMA ( to TAYLOR ) My Dad does n't owe money to anyone ! TAYLOR ( to WESLEY ) I 'm really sorry . I thought your mother told her . ( ELLA enters from left in a dress and handbag with white gloves . TAYLOR stands when he sees her . ) ELLA What 's all the shouting going on for ? Oh , Mr. Taylor . I was n't expecting you for another half-hour . TAYLOR Yes , I know . I saw the car out in front so I thought I 'd stop in early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you meet everyone ? TAYLOR Yes , I did . ELLA ( noticing lamb ) What 's that animal doing in here , Wesley ? WESLEY It 's got maggots . ELLA Well , get him out of the kitchen . WESLEY It 's the warmest part of the house . p. 37 ELLA Get him out ! EMMA Mom , are you selling this house ? ELLA Who told her ? TAYLOR Well , I 'm afraid it slipped out . ELLA Emma , I 'm not going to discuss it now . Go change your clothes . EMMA ( coldly ) If you sell this house , I 'm never going to see you again . ( EMMA exits left . TAYLOR smiles , embarrassed . ) TAYLOR I 'm very sorry . I assumed that she knew . ELLA It does n't matter . She 's leaving anyway . Now , Wes , I 'm going out with Mr. Taylor for a little lunch and to discuss our business . When I come back I want that lamb out of the kitchen . TAYLOR ( to WESLEY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have met you . ( WESLEY ignores the gesture and just stares at him . ) ELLA ( to TAYLOR ) He 's sullen by nature . Picks it up from his father . TAYLOR I see . ( to WESLEY ) Nitroglycerine , too , I suppose ? ( chuckles ) ( ELLA and TAYLOR start to exit off right . ELLA turns to WESLEY. ) p. 38 ELLA Keep an eye out for Emma , Wes . She 's got the curse . You know what that 's like for a girl , the first time around . ( TAYLOR and ELLA exit . WESLEY stands there for a while . He turns and looks at the lamb . ) WESLEY ( staring at lamb ) " Eat American Lamb . Twenty million coyotes ca n't be wrong . " ( He crosses to refrigerator and opens it . He stares into it . ) WESLEY You 're out of luck . Santa Claus has n't come yet . ( He slams refrigerator door and turns to lamb . He stares at lamb . ) WESLEY ( to lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're lucky this is a civilized household . You 're lucky it 's not Korea and the rains are pouring through the cardboard walls and you 're tied to a log in the mud and you 're drenched to the bone and you 're skinny and starving , but it makes no difference because someone 's starving more than you . Someone 's hungry . And his hunger takes him outside with a knife and slits your throat and eats you raw . His hunger eats you , and you 're starving . ( Loud crash of garbage cans being knocked over off stage right . Sound of WESTON , WESLEY 'S father , off right. ) p. 39 WESTON 'S VOICE ( off right ) WHO PUT THE GODDAMN GARBAGE CANS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GODDAMN DOOR ? ( WESLEY listens for a second , then bolts off stage left . More crashing is heard off right . General cursing from WESTON , then he enters from right with a large duffel bag full of laundry and a large bag full of groceries . He 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like it 's been slept in , a blue baseball cap , baggy pants , and tennis shoes . He 's unshaven and slightly drunk . He takes a few steps and stops cold when he sees the lamb . He just stares at the lamb for a minute , then crosses to the table and sets the bag of groceries and the laundry on the table . He crosses back to center and looks at the lamb inside the fence . ) WESTON ( to lamb ) What in the hell are you doin ' in here ? ( he looks around the space , to himself ) Is this inside or outside ? This is inside , right ? This is the inside of the house . Even with the door out it 's still the inside . ( to lamb ) Right ? ( to himself ) Right . ( to lamb ) So what the hell are you doing in here if this is the inside ? ( he chuckles to himself ) That 's not funny . ( He crosses to the refrigerator and opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZERO ! NADA ! GOOSE EGGS ! ( he yells at the house in general ) WE 'VE DONE IT AGAIN ! WE 'VE GONE AND LEFT EVERYTHING UP TO THE OLD MAN AGAIN ! ALL THE UPKEEP ! THE MAINTENANCE ! PERFECT ! ( He slams the refrigerator door and crosses back to the table . ) WESTON I do n't even know why we keep a refrigerator in this house . All it 's good for is slamming . ( He picks up the bag of groceries and crosses back to the refrigerator , talking to himself . ) WESTON Slams all day long and through the night . SLAM ! SLAM ! SLAM ! What 's everybody hoping for , a miracle ! IS EVERYBODY HOPING FOR A MIRACLE ? ( He opens refrigerator as WESLEY enters from stage right and stops . WESTON 'S back is to him . WESTON starts taking artichokes out of the bag and putting them in the refrigerator . ) WESTON ( to house ) THERE 'S NO MORE MIRACLES ! NO MIRACLES TODAY ! THEY 'VE BEEN ALL USED UP ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COME HOME TO REPLENISH THE EMPTY LARDER ! WESLEY What 're you yelling for ? There 's nobody here . ( WESTON wheels around facing WESLEY . WESLEY stays still. ) p. 41 WESTON What the hell are you sneakin ' up like that for ? You coulda ' got yourself killed ! WESLEY What 's in the bag ? WESTON Groceries ! What else . Somebody 's got ta ' feed this house . ( WESTON turns back to refrigerator and goes on putting more artichokes into it . ) WESLEY What kind of groceries ? WESTON Artichokes ! What do you think ? WESLEY ( coming closer ) Artichokes ? WESTON Yeah . Good desert artichokes . Picked ' em up for half-price out in Hot Springs . WESLEY You went all the way out there for artichokes ? WESTON ' Course not ! What do you think I am , an idiot or something ? I went out there to check on my land . WESLEY What land ? WESTON My desert land ! Now stop talking ! Everything was all right until you came in . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WESTON empties the bag into the refrigerator , then slams the door shut . He crunches up the bag and crosses back to the table . He opens up his bag of laundry and starts taking dirty clothes out and stacking them in piles on the table . WESLEY crosses to refrigerator and opens it , looks in at artichokes . He takes one out and looks at it closely , then puts it back in . They keep talking through all this. ) p. 42 WESLEY I did n't know you had land in the desert . WESTON ' Course I do . I got an acre and a half out there . WESLEY You never told me . WESTON Why should I tell you ? I told your mother . WESLEY She never told me . WESTON Aw , shut up , will ya ' ? WESLEY What kind of land is it ? WESTON It 's not what I expected , that 's for sure . WESLEY What is it , then ? WESTON It 's just not what I expected . Some guy came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What guy ? WESTON Some guy . Looked respectable . Talked a real good line . Said it was an investment for the future . All kinds of great things were going to be developed . Golf courses , shopping centers , banks , sauna baths . All that kinda ' stuff . So I bought it . WESLEY How much did you pay ? WESTON Well , I did n't pay the whole thing . I put something down on it . I 'm not stupid . WESLEY How much ? p. 43 WESTON Why should I tell you ? I borrowed it , so it 's none of your goddamn business how much it was ! WESLEY But it turned out to be a hoax , huh ? WESTON A real piece of shit . Just a bunch of strings on sticks , with the lizards blowing across it . WESLEY Nothing around it ? WESTON Not a thing . Just desert . No way to even get water to the goddamn place . No way to even set a trailer on it . WESLEY Where 's the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother anyway ? WESLEY ( shutting refrigerator ) She went out . WESTON Yeah , I know she went out . The car 's gone . Where 'd she go to ? WESLEY Do n't know . WESTON ( bundling up empty duffel bag under his arm ) Well , when she gets back tell her to do this laundry for me . Tell her not to put bleach in anything but the socks and no starch in the collars . Can you remember that ? WESLEY Yeah , I think so . No bleach and no starch . WESTON That 's it . You got it . Now do n't forget . ( he heads for stage right ) p. 44 WESLEY Where are you going ? WESTON Just never mind where I 'm going ! I can take care of myself . ( he stops and looks at the lamb ) What 's the matter with the lamb ? WESLEY Maggots . WESTON Poor little bugger . Put some a ' that blue shit on it . That 'll fix him up . You know that blue stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' that on it . ( pauses a second , looks around ) You know I was even thinkin ' a ' sellin ' this place . WESLEY You were ? WESTON Yeah . Do n't tell your mother though . WESLEY I wo n't . WESTON Bank probably wo n't let me , but I was thinkin ' I could sell it and buy some land down in Mexico . WESLEY Why down there ? WESTON I like it down there . ( looks at lamb again ) Do n't forget about that blue stuff . Ca n't afford to lose any lambs . Only had but two sets a ' twins this year , did n't we ? WESLEY Three . WESTON Well , three then . It 's not much . ( WESTON exits stage right . WESLEY looks at lamb . Lights fade to black. ) @x ( pause , as they work ) They 're probably half way to Mexico by now . WESLEY Who ? EMMA She 's snuggling up to him and giggling and turning the dial on the radio . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs and bragging about his business . WESLEY She 'll be back . EMMA She 's telling him all about us and about how Dad 's crazy and trying to kill her all the time . She 's happy to be on the road . To see new places go flashing by . They cross the border and gamble on the jai alai games . They head for Baja and swim along the beaches . They build campfires and roast fish at night . In the morning they take off again . But they break down somewhere outside a little place called Los Cerritos . They have to hike five miles into town . They come to a small beat-up gas station with one pump and a dog with three legs . There 's only one mechanic in the whole town , and that 's me . They do n't recognize me though . They ask if I can fix their " carro , " and I speak only Spanish . I 've lost the knack for English by now . I understand them though and give them a lift back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump out and look inside the hood . I see that it 's only the rotor inside the distributor that 's broken , but I tell them that it needs an entire new generator , a new coil points and plugs , and some slight adjustments to the carburator . It 's an overnight job , and I 'll have to charge them for labor . So I set a cot up for them in the garage , and after they 've fallen asleep I take out the entire engine and put in a rebuilt Volkswagen block . In the morning I charge them double for labor , see them on their way , and then resell their engine for a small mint . p. 48 WESLEY If you 're not doing anything , would you check the artichokes ? EMMA I am doing something . WESLEY What ? EMMA I 'm remaking my charts . WESLEY What do you spend your time on that stuff for ? You should be doing more important stuff . EMMA Like checking artichokes ? WESLEY Yeah ! EMMA You check the artichokes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMMA Do n't get personal . It 's not nice . You should have more consideration . WESLEY Just put some water in them , would you ? Before they burn . ( EMMA throws down her magic marker and crosses to the pot of artichokes . She looks in the pot and then crosses back to her chair and goes on working on her charts . ) WESLEY Are they all right ? EMMA Perfect . Just like a little boiling paradise in a pot . What 're you making anyway ? WESLEY A new door . What 's it look like ? EMMA Looks like a bunch of sawed-up wood to me. p. 49 WESLEY At least it 's practical . EMMA We 're doing okay without a front door . Besides it might turn off potential buyers . Makes the place look like a chicken shack . ( remembers her chicken ) Oh , my chicken ! I could 've killed her right then . WESLEY You do n't understand what 's happening yet , do you ? EMMA With what ? WESLEY The house . You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' buy this place , but it 's not . It 's Taylor . EMMA He 's a lawyer . WESLEY He works for an agency . Land development . EMMA So what ? WESLEY So it means more than losing a house . It means losing a country . EMMA You make it sound like an invasion . WESLEY It is . It 's a zombie invasion . Taylor is the head zombie . He 's the scout for the other zombies . He 's only a sign that more zombies are on their way . They 'll be filing through the door pretty soon . EMMA Once you get it built . WESLEY There 'll be bulldozers crashing through the orchard . There 'll be giant steel balls crashing through the walls . There 'll be foremen with their sleeves rolled up and blueprints under their arms . There 'll be steel girders spanning acres of land . Cement pilings . Prefab walls . Zombie architecture , owned by invisible zombies , built by zombies for the use and convenience of all other zombies . A zombie city ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 50 EMMA We could occupy it . Dad 's got a gun . WESLEY It 's a Jap gun . EMMA It works . I saw him shoot a peacock with it once . WESLEY A peacock ? EMMA Blasted it to smithereens . It was sitting right out there in the sycamore tree . It was screaming all night long . WESLEY Probably mating season . EMMA ( after long pause ) You think they 'll come back ? WESLEY Who ? EMMA Our parents . WESLEY You mean ever ? EMMA Yeah . Maybe they 'll never come back , and we 'll have the whole place to ourselves . We could do a lot with this place . WESLEY I 'm not staying here forever . EMMA Where are you going ? WESLEY I do n't know . Alaska , maybe . EMMA Alaska ? WESLEY Sure . Why not ? EMMA What 's in Alaska ? WESLEY The frontier . p. 51 EMMA Are you crazy ? It 's all frozen and full of rapers . WESLEY It 's full of possibilities . It 's undiscovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( WESTON suddenly stumbles on from stage right . He 's considerably drunker than the last time . EMMA stands at the table , not knowing whether to stay or leave . WESTON looks at her . ) WESTON ( to EMMA ) Just relax . Relax ! It 's only your old man . Sit down ! ( EMMA sits again . WESLEY stands by awkwardly . WESTON looks at the wood on the floor . ) WESTON ( to WESLEY ) What the hell 's all this ? You building a barn in here or something ? WESLEY New door . WESTON What ! Do n't talk with your voice in the back of your throat like a worm ! Talk with your teeth ! Talk ! WESLEY I am talking . WESTON All right . Now I asked you what all this is . What is all this ? WESLEY It 's a new door . WESTON What 's a new door ? What 's the matter with the old door ? p. 52 WESLEY It 's gone . ( WESTON turns around , weaving slightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he turns back to WESLEY ) Where 'd it go ? WESLEY You broke it down . WESTON Oh . ( he looks toward table ) My laundry done yet ? EMMA She did n't come back yet . WESTON Who did n't ? EMMA Mom . WESTON She did n't come back yet ? It 's been all night . Has n't it been all night ? EMMA Yes . WESTON Has n't the sun rised and falled on this miserable planet ? EMMA Yes . WESTON ( turning to WESLEY ) So where 's she been ? WESLEY Do n't know . WESTON Do n't pull that one ! Do n't pull that one on me ! ( He starts to come after WESLEY . WESLEY backs off fast . WESTON stops . He stands there weaving in place . ) WESLEY I do n't know . Really . p. 53 WESTON Do n't try protecting her ! There 's no protection ! Understand ! None ! She 's had it ! WESLEY I do n't know where she went . EMMA She went with a lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? EMMA A lawyer . WESTON What 's a lawyer ? A law man ? A person of the law ? ( suddenly yelling ) WHAT 'S A LAWYER ? EMMA A guy named Taylor . ( Long pause , as WESTON stares at her drunkenly , trying to fathom it . Then he turns to WESLEY . ) WESTON ( to WESLEY ) Taylor ? You knew ? WESLEY I thought she 'd be back by now . She said she was going out for a business lunch . WESTON You knew ! EMMA Maybe they had an accident . WESTON ( to EMMA ) In my car ! In my Kaiser-Fraser ! I 'll break his fucking back ! WESLEY Maybe they did have an accident . I 'll call the hospitals . p. 54 WESTON DO N'T CALL ANYBODY ! ( quieter ) Do n't call anybody . ( pause ) That car was an antique . Worth a fortune . EMMA ( after long pause ) You wan na ' sit down , Pop ? WESTON I 'm standing . What 's that smell in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They smell like that ? WESLEY They 're boiling . WESTON Stop them from boiling ! They might boil over . ( WESLEY goes to stove and turns it off . ) WESTON Where 's that goddamn sheep you had in here ? Is that what you 're building ? A barn for that sheep ? WESLEY A door . WESTON ( staggering ) I got ta sit down . ( He stumbles toward table and sits at stage right end . EMMA stands . ) WESTON ( to EMMA ) Sit down ! Sit back down ! Turn off those artichokes ! WESLEY I did . WESTON ( pushing laundry to one side ) She did n't do any of this . It 's the same as when I brought it . None of it ! p. 55 EMMA I 'll do it . WESTON No , you wo n't do it ! You let her do it ! It 's her job ! What does she do around here anyway ? Do you know ? What does she do all day long ? What does a woman do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school . EMMA It 's all right if I do it . I do n't mind doing it . WESTON YOU 'RE NOT DOING IT ! ( long silence ) What do you think of this place ? EMMA The house ? WESTON The whole thing . The whole fandango ! The orchard ! The air ! The night sky ! EMMA It 's all right . WESTON ( to WESLEY ) What do you think of it ? WESLEY I would n't sell it . WESTON You would n't sell it . You could n't sell it ! It 's not yours ! WESLEY I know . But I would n't if it was . WESTON How come ? What good is it ? What good 's it doing ? WESLEY It 's just here . And we 're on it . And we would n't be if it got sold . p. 56 WESTON Very sound reasoning . Very sound . ( turns to EMMA ) Your brother never was much in the brain department , was he ? You 're the one who 's such a smart-ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EMMA Yes . WESTON Straight-A 's and you 're moldering around this dump . What 're you going to do with yourself ? EMMA I do n't know . WESTON You do n't know . Well you better think of something fast , because I 've found a buyer . ( silence ) I 've found someone to give me cash . Cash on the line ! ( he slams table with his hand . Long silence , then EMMA gets up and exits off left . ) WESTON What 's the matter with her ? WESLEY I do n't know . She 's got her first period . WESTON Her what ? She 's too young for that . That 's not supposed to happen when they 're that age . It 's premature . WESLEY She 's got it . WESTON What happens when I 'm gone , you all sit around and talk about your periods ? You 're not supposed to know when your sister has her period ! That 's confidential between women . They keep it a secret that means . p. 57 WESLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WESLEY Why do n't you go to bed or something , so I can finish this door . WESTON What for ? I told ya ' I 'm selling the joint . Why build a new door ? No point in putting money into it . WESLEY I 'm still living here . I 'm living here right up to the point when I leave . WESTON Very brave . Very courageous outlook . I envy it in fact . WESLEY You do ? WESTON Sure ! Of course ! What else is there to envy but an outlook ? Look at mine ! Look at my outlook . You do n't envy it , right ? WESLEY No . WESTON That 's because it 's full of poison . Infected . And you recognize poison , right ? You recognize it when you see it ? WESLEY Yes . WESTON Yes , you do . I can see that you do . My poison scares you . WESLEY Does n't scare me . WESTON No ? WESLEY No . WESTON Good . You 're growing up . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than you . Much older . And then you know how I recognized it ? p. 58 WESLEY How ? WESTON Because I saw myself infected with it . That 's how . I saw me carrying it around . His poison in my body . You think that 's fair ? WESLEY I do n't know . WESTON Well , what do you think ? You think I asked for it ? WESLEY No . WESTON So it 's unfair , right ? WESLEY It 's just the way it happened . WESTON I did n't ask for it , but I got it . WESLEY What is it anyway ? WESTON What do you mean , what is it ? You can see it for yourself ! WESLEY I know it 's there , but I do n't know what it is . WESTON You 'll find out . WESLEY How ? WESTON How do you poison coyotes ? WESLEY Strychnine . WESTON How ! Not what ! WESLEY You put it in the belly of a dead lamb . WESTON Right . Now do you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're thick ! You 're really thick . ( pause ) You know I watched my old man move around . I watched him move through rooms . I watched him drive tractors , watched him watching baseball , watched him keeping out of the way of things . Out of the way of my mother . Away from my brothers . Watched him on the sidelines . Nobody saw him but me . Everybody was right here , but nobody saw him but me . He lived apart . Right in the midst of things and he lived apart . Nobody saw that . ( Long pause . ) WESLEY You want an artichoke ? WESTON No . WESLEY Who 's the buyer ? WESTON Some guy . Owns the " Alibi Club " downtown . Said he 'll give me cash . WESLEY How much ? WESTON Enough to get to Mexico . They ca n't touch me down there . WESLEY Who ? WESTON None of your goddamn business ! Why is it you always drive yourself under my skin when I 'm around ? Why is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart ! Very observant ! What 's the matter with you anyway ? What 're you doing around here ? p. 60 WESLEY I 'm part of your offspring . WESTON Jesus , you 're enough to drive a sane man crazy ! You 're like having an espionage spy around . Why are you watching me all the time ? ( WESTON looks at him . They stare at each other for a moment . ) WESTON You can watch me all you want to . You wo n't find out a thing . WESLEY Mom 's trying to sell the place , too . ( WESTON looks at him hard . ) WESLEY That 's who the lawyer guy was . She 's selling it through him . ( WESTON stands and almost topples over . ) WESTON I 'LL KILL HER ! I 'LL KILL BOTH OF THEM ! Where 's my gun ? I had a gun here ! A captured gun ! WESLEY Take it easy . WESTON No , you take it easy ! This whole thing has gone far enough ! It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my back !

( He falls into table and collapses on it . He tries to keep himself from falling to the floor . WESLEY moves toward him. ) p. 61 WESTON JUST KEEP BACK ! I 'M NOT DYING , SO JUST KEEP BACK ! ( He struggles to pull himself up on the table , knocking off dirty laundry and EMMA 'S charts . ) WESTON I do n't need a bed . I do n't need anything from you ! I 'll stay right here . DO N'T ANYONE TRY TO MOVE ME ! NOBODY ! I 'm staying right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lying flat out on it . He slowly goes unconscious . WESLEY watches him from a safe distance . ) WESLEY ( still standing there watching WESTON ) EMMA ! ( no answer ) Oh , shit . Do n't go out on me . Pop ? ( He moves toward WESTON cautiously . WESTON comes to suddenly . Still lying on table . ) WESTON DO N'T GET TOO CLOSE ! ( WESLEY jumps back . ) WESLEY Would n't you rather be on the bed ? WESTON I 'm all right here . I 'm numb . Do n't feel a thing . Feels good to be numb . WESLEY We do n't have to sell , you know . We could fix the place up . WESTON It 's too late for that . I owe money . WESLEY I could get a job . p. 62 WESTON You 're gon na ' have to . WESLEY I will . We could work this place by ourselves . WESTON Do n't be stupid . There 's not enough trees to make a living . WESLEY We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living that way . WESTON Get out of here ! Get away from me ! WESLEY Taylor ca n't buy this place without your signature . WESTON I 'll kill him ! If I have to , I 'll kill myself along with him . I 'll crash into him . I 'll crash the Packard right into him . What 's he look like ? ( no answer from WESLEY ) WHAT 'S HE LOOK LIKE ? WESLEY Ordinary . Like a crook . WESTON ( still lying on table ) I 'll find him . Then I 'll find that punk who sold me that phony desert land . I 'll track them all down . Every last one of them . Your mother too . I 'll track her down and shoot them in their bed . In their hotel bed . I 'll splatter their brains all over the vibrating bed . I 'll drag him into the hotel lobby and slit his throat . I was in the war . I know how to kill . I was over there . I know how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no big deal . You just make an adjustment . You convince yourself it 's all right . That 's all . It 's easy . You just slaughter them . Easy . p. 63 WESLEY You do n't have to kill him . It 's illegal , what he 's doing . WESTON HE 'S WITH MY WIFE ! THAT 'S ILLEGAL ! WESLEY She 'll come back . WESTON He does n't know what he 's dealing with . He thinks I 'm just like him . Cowardly . Sniveling . Sneaking around . He 's not counting on what 's in my blood . He does n't realize the explosiveness . We do n't belong to the same class . He does n't realize that . He 's not counting on that . He 's counting on me to use my reason . To talk things out . To have a conversation . To go out and have a business lunch and talk things over . He 's not counting on murder . Murder 's the farthest thing from his mind . WESLEY Just take it easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sleeping ! I 'm sleeping right here . I 'm falling away . I was a flyer you know . WESLEY I know . WESTON I flew giant machines in the air . Giants ! Bombers . What a sight . Over Italy . The Pacific . Islands . Giants . Oceans . Blue oceans . ( Slowly WESTON goes unconscious again as WESLEY watches him lying on table . WESLEY moves toward him slightly . ) WESLEY Pop ? ( he moves in a little closer ) You asleep ? ( He turns downstage and looks at the wood and tools . He looks toward the refrigerator . ELLA enters from down right carrying a bag of groceries . She stops when she sees WESLEY . WESLEY turns toward her . ELLA looks at WESTON lying on the table. ) p. 64 ELLA How long 's he been here ? WESLEY Just got here . Where have you been ? ELLA ( crossing to refrigerator ) Out . WESLEY Where 's your boyfriend ? ELLA ( opening refrigerator ) Do n't get insulting . Who put all these artichokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He brought them back from the desert . ELLA What desert ? WESLEY Hot Springs . ELLA Oh . He went down to look at his pathetic piece of property , I guess . ( ELLA sets the bag of groceries on the stove , then starts throwing the artichokes out onto the floor from the refrigerator . ) WESLEY What are you doing ? ELLA Throwing these out . It 's a joke bringing artichokes back here when we 're out of food . WESLEY How do you know about his desert property ? ELLA I just know , that 's all . WESLEY He told you ? He never told me about it . ELLA I just happen to know he was screwed out of five hundred bucks . Let 's leave it at that . Another shrewd business deal . p. 65 WESLEY Taylor . ELLA ( turning to WESLEY ) What ? WESLEY Taylor sold it to him right ? ELLA Do n't be ridiculous . ( turns back to refrigerator ) WESLEY How else would you know ? ELLA He 's not the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WESLEY He 's been sneaking around here for months . ELLA Sneaking ? He does n't sneak . He comes right to the front door every time . He 's very polite . WESLEY He 's venomous . ELLA You 're just jealous of him , that 's all . WESLEY Do n't give me that shit ! It was him , was n't it ? I remember seeing him with his briefcase , wandering around the property . ELLA He 's a speculator . That 's his job . It 's very important in this day and age to have someone who can accurately assess the value of land . To see its potential for the future . ( She starts putting all the groceries from her bag into the refrigerator . ) WESLEY What exactly is he anyway ? You told me he was a lawyer . p. 66 ELLA I do n't delve into his private affairs . WESLEY You do n't , huh ? ELLA Why are you so bitter all of a sudden ? WESLEY It 's not all of a sudden . ELLA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . To travel . To see other parts of the world . WESLEY I 'm not leaving ! ELLA Oh , yes you are . We all are . I 've sealed the deal . It just needs one last little signature from me and it 's finished . Everything . The beat-up cars , the rusted out tractor , the moldy avocados , the insane horse , the demented sheep , the chickens , the whole entire shooting match . The whole collection . Over . WESLEY Then you 're free I suppose ? ELLA Exactly . WESLEY Are you going off with him ? ELLA I wish you 'd get your mind out of the garbage . I 'm on my own . WESLEY Where 'd you get the groceries ? ELLA I picked them up . WESLEY ( after pause ) You know , you 're too late . All your wheeling and dealing and you 've missed the boat . p. 67 ELLA ( closing refrigerator , turning to WESLEY ) What do you mean ? WESLEY Dad 's already sold it . ELLA You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at him ! Look at him lying there ! Does that look like a man who could sell something as valuable as a piece of property ? Does that look like competence to you ? Take a look at him ! He 's pathetic ! WESLEY I would n't wake him up if I were you . ELLA He ca n't hurt me now ! I 've got protection ! If he lays a hand on me , I 'll have him cut to ribbons ! He 's finished ! WESLEY He 's beat you to the punch and he does n't even know it . ELLA Do n't talk stupid ! And get this junk out of here ! I 'm tired of looking at broken doors every time I come in here . WESLEY That 's a new door . ELLA GET IT OUT OF HERE ! WESLEY ( quietly ) I told you , you better not wake him up . ELLA I 'm not tiptoeing around anymore . I 'm finished with feeling like a foreigner in my own house . I 'm not afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to kill Taylor , you know . p. 68 ELLA He 's always going to kill somebody ! Every day he 's going to kill somebody ! WESLEY He means it this time . He 's got nothing to lose . ELLA That 's for sure ! WESLEY He 's going to kill you , too . ( ELLA is silent for a while . They look at each other . ) ELLA Do you know what this is ? It 's a curse . I can feel it . It 's invisible but it 's there . It 's always there . It comes onto us like nighttime . Every day I can feel it . Every day I can see it coming . And it always comes . Repeats itself . It comes even when you do everything to stop it from coming . Even when you try to change it . And it goes back . Deep . It goes back and back to tiny little cells and genes . To atoms . To tiny little swimming things making up their minds without us . Plotting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're surrounded with it . It 's bigger than government even . It goes forward too . We spread it . We pass it on . We inherit it and pass it down , and then pass it down again . It goes on and on like that without us . ( ELLIS , the owner of the " Alibi Club , " enters from right and smiles at them . He is wearing a shiny yellow shirt , open at the collar , with a gold cross on a chain hanging from his neck . He 's very burly , with tattooes all over his arms , tight-fitting pants , shiny shoes , lots of rings . He looks around and notices WESTON still lying on the table. ) p. 69 ELLIS A few too many " boiler-makers , " huh ? I keep telling him to go light , but it 's like fartin ' in the wind . ( laughs at his own joke ) You must be the wife and kids . Name 's Ellis , I run the " Alibi Club , " down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( No reaction from ELLA and WESLEY . ) ELLIS Well , the old man knows it , that 's for sure . Down there pretty near every night . Regular steady . Always wondered where he slept . What 's that smell in here ? WESLEY Artichokes . ELLIS Artichokes , huh ? Smells like stale piss . ( bursts out laughing ; no reaction from others ) Never was big on vegetables myself . I 'm a steak man . " Meat and blood , " that 's my motto . Keeps your bones hard as ivory . ELLA I know it may be asking a little bit too much to knock when there 's no door to knock on , but do you always make a habit of just wandering into people 's houses like you own them ? ELLIS I do own it . ( pause ) That 's right . Signed , sealed , and delivered . Got the cash right here . ( He pulls out two big stacks of bills from his belt and waves them in the air . ) ELLIS Fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars ! ( looks at ELLA ) ELLIS That 's what he owes . That 's the price we agreed on . Look , buddy , I did n't even have to show up here with it . Your old man 's such a sap he signed the whole thing over to me without a dime even crossing the bar . I coulda ' stung him easy . Just happens that I 'm a man of honor . ELLA ( to WESLEY ) Get him out of here ! ELLIS ( coldly to WESLEY ) I would n't try it , buddy boy . ( ELLIS and WESLEY stare at each other . ELLIS smiles . ) ELLIS I 've broken too many backs in my time , buddy . I 'm not a hard man , but I 'm strong as a bull calf , and I do n't realize my own strength . It 's terrible when that happens . You know ? Before you know it , someone 's hurt . Someone 's lying there . ELLA This is a joke ! You ca n't buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for his actions ! ELLIS He owns it , does n't he ? ELLA I OWN IT ! ELLIS That 's not what he told me . ELLA I own it and it 's already been sold , so just get the hell out ! p. 71 ELLIS Well , I 've got the deed right here . ( he pulls deed out ) Right here . Signed , sealed , and delivered . How do you explain that ? ELLA It 's not legal ! WESLEY Who does he owe money to ? ELLIS Oh , well , now I do n't stick my nose where it does n't belong . I just happen to know that he owes to some pretty hard fellas . WESLEY Fifteen hundred bucks ? ELLIS That 's about the size of it . ELLA Wake him up ! We 'll get to the bottom of this . WESLEY ( to ELLA ) Are you crazy ? If he sees you here he 'll go off the deep end . ELLA ( going to WESTON and shaking him ) I 'll wake him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unconscious . ELLA keeps shaking him violently . ) ELLA Weston ! Weston get up ! Weston ! ELLIS I 've seen some hard cases in my time , but he 's dedicated . That 's for sure . Drinks like a Canadian . Flat out . WESLEY You say these guys are tough ? What does he owe them for ? p. 72 ELLIS Look , buddy , he borrows all the time . He 's a borrowing fool . It could be anything . Payments on a car . Land in the desert . He 's always got some fool scheme going . He 's just let it slide too long this time , that 's all . WESLEY What 'll they do to him ? ELLIS Nothing now . I 've saved his hide . You should be kissing my feet . ELLA WESTON ! GET UP ! ( She is tiring from shaking him . WESTON remains unconscious . ) WESLEY They 'd kill him for fifteen hundred bucks ? ELLIS Who said anything about killing ? Did I say anything about killing ? WESLEY No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get in trouble that way . WESLEY Maybe you should deliver it to them . ELLIS Look , I 've carried the ball this far , now he 's gon na ' have to do the rest . I 'm not his bodyguard . WESLEY What if he takes off with it ? ELLIS That 's his problem . WESLEY Give it to me . ELLIS What ? p. 73 WESLEY The money . I 'll deliver it . ELLA ( leaving WESTON ) Wesley , do n't you touch that money ! It 's tainted ! Do n't you touch it ! ( ELLIS and WESLEY look at each other . ) WESLEY You 've got the deed . I 'm his oldest son . ELLA You 're his only son ! WESLEY Just give it to me . I 'll take care of it . ELLIS ( handing money to WESLEY ) All right , buddy . Just do n't go off half-cocked . That 's a lot a ' spendin ' change for a young man . ( WESLEY takes it . ) ELLA Wesley , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to ELLIS ) Where do I find them ? ELLIS That 's your business , buddy . I 'm just the buyer . ( ELLIS walks around , looking over the place . ELLA crosses to WESLEY as WESLEY counts the money . ) ELLA Wesley , you give me that money ! It does n't belong to you ! Give it to me ! WESLEY ( looking at her coldly ) There 's not enough here to go to Europe on , Mom . p. 74 ELLIS I was thinkin ' of turning this place into a steak house . What do you think ? Make a nice little steak house , do n't you think ? WESLEY ( still counting money ) Sure . ELLIS People stop in off the highway , have a steak , a martini , afternoon cocktail , look out over the valley . Nice and peaceful . Might even put in a Japanese garden out front . Have a few goldfish swimming around . Maybe an eight-hole pitch-and-putt course right out there , too . Place is full of potential . ELLA Wesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLA turns and sees him . WESLEY keeps counting money . ) TAYLOR Oh . I 'm sorry . I did n't realize you had company . ( to ELLA ) I 've got the final draft drawn up . ( TAYLOR crosses toward table , sees WESTON lying on it , stops , looks for a place to set down his attach case . ) ELLA ( to TAYLOR ) It 's too late . TAYLOR Excuse me ? What 's too late ? ELLA The whole thing . Weston 's sold it . TAYLOR That 's silly . I 've got the final draft right here in my case . All it needs is your signature . p. 75 ELLIS Who 's this character ? ELLA ( to TAYLOR ) He sold it for fifteen hundred dollars . TAYLOR ( laughs ) That 's impossible . ELLA There it is right there ! Wesley 's got it in his hands ! Wesley 's taking it ! TAYLOR He ca n't sell this piece of property . He 's incompetent . We 've already been through that . ELLIS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what your story is , but I suggest you get the fuck outa ' here because this is my deal here . Understand ? This is my little package . TAYLOR ( to ELLA ) Who 's this ? ELLA He 's the buyer . WESLEY ( to TAYLOR ) Too slow on the trigger , Taylor . Took it right out from under you , did n't he ? TAYLOR Well , it 's simply a matter of going to court then . He does n't have a leg to stand on . Legally he 's a ward of the state . He ca n't sell land . ELLIS ( waving deed ) Look , I checked this deed out at city hall , and everything 's above board . p. 76 TAYLOR The deed has nothing to do with it . I 'm speaking of psychological responsibility . WESLEY Does that apply to buying the same as selling ? TAYLOR ( to EMMA ) What 's he talking about ? ELLA Nothing . Wesley , you give that money back ! WESLEY Does that apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert with no water and a hundred miles from the nearest gas pump ? TAYLOR ( to WESLEY ) I think you 're trying to divert the focus of the situation here . The point is that your father 's psychologically and emotionally unfit to be responsible for his own actions , and , therefore , any legal negotiations issuing from him can not be held binding . This can be easily proven in a court of law . We have first-hand evidence that he 's prone to fits of violence . His license for driving has been revoked , and yet he still keeps driving . He 's unable to get insurance . He 's unable to hold a steady job . He 's absent from his home ninety percent of the time . He has a jail record . It 's an open and shut case . ELLIS ( to TAYLOR ) What are you anyway ? A lawyer or something ? Where do you get off talkin ' like that in my house ! p. 77 ELLA IT 'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ! THAT 'S WHAT HE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE A BRAIN IN YOUR HEAD ? ELLIS Listen , lady , I sell booze . You know what I mean ? A lot a ' weird stuff goes on in my bar , but I never seen anything as weird as this character . I never seen anything I could n't handle . WESLEY You best take off , Taylor , before it all catches up to you . TAYLOR I refuse to be intimidated any further ! I put myself out on a limb for this project and all I 'm met with is resistance ! ELLA I 'm not resisting . TAYLOR ( to WESLEY ) You may not realize it , but there 's corporations behind me ! Executive management ! People of influence . People with ambition who realize the importance of investing in the future . Of building this country up , not tearing it down . You people carry on as though the whole world revolved around your petty little existence . As though everything was holding its breath , waiting for your next move . Well , it 's not like that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going ahead without you ! The wheels are in motion . There 's nothing you can do to turn it back . The only thing you can do is cooperate . To play ball . To become part of us . To invest in the future of this great land . Because if you do n't , you 'll all be left behind . Every last one of you . Left high and dry . And there 'll be nothing to save you . Nothing and nobody . ( A policeman appears stage right in highway patrol gear. ) p. 78 MALCOLM Uh  --  excuse me . Mrs. Tate ? ELLA Yes . MALCOLM Are you Mrs. Tate ? ELLA Yes , I am . MALCOLM I 'm sorry . I would have knocked but there 's no door . ELLA That 's all right . ( TAYLOR begins to move to stage left nervously . WESLEY watches him . ) MALCOLM I 'm Sergeant Malcolm , Highway Patrol . ELLA Well , what is it ? MALCOLM You have a daughter , Emma Tate ? ELLA Yes . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What for ? MALCOLM It seems she rode her horse through a bar downtown and shot the place full of holes with a rifle . ELLA What ? ELLIS What bar ? MALCOLM Place called the " Alibi Club . " I was n't there at the time , but they picked her up . ELLIS That 's my club ! MALCOLM ( to ELLIS ) Are you the owner ? p. 79 ELLIS THAT 'S MY CLUB ! MALCOLM Are you Mr. Ellis ? ELLIS What kind of damages ? MALCOLM Well , we 'll have to get an estimate , but it 's pretty severe . Shot the whole place up . Just lucky there was no one in it at the time . ELLIS ( to WESLEY ) Give me that money back ! ( ELLIS grabs money out of WESLEY 's hands . TAYLOR sneaks off stage left . ) WESLEY ( to cop ) Hey ! He 's getting away ! That guy 's a crook ! MALCOLM What guy ? WESLEY ( moving toward stage left ) That guy ! That guy who just ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence man ! Whatever you call it . He sold my old man phony land ! MALCOLM That 's not within my jurisdiction . ELLIS ( to ELLA ) I know he sent her down there . I was n't born yesterday , ya ' know ! He 's crazy if he thinks he can put that kind of muscle on me ! What does he think he is anyway ? I 'm gon na ' sue him blind for this ! I 'm gon na ' take the shirt right off his back ! I was trying to do him a favor ! I was stickin ' my neck out for him ! You just tell him when he wakes up out of his stupor that he 's in bigger trouble than he thinks ! He ai n't seen nothin ' yet ! You tell him .

I deal directly with them all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 MALCOLM I do n't know about that . I 'm here on other business . ELLIS ( to ELLA ) You just tell him !

I do n't know about any of this other stuff . I 'm here about your daughter . ( WESLEY runs off right . ELLA yells after him . ) ELLA WESLEY ! WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? WESLEY 'S VOICE ( off ) I 'M GON NA ' GET THAT MONEY BACK ! ELLA IT 'S NOT YOUR MONEY ! COME BACK HERE ! WESLEY ! ( she stops and looks at MALCOLM ) Everybody 's running off . Even Mr. Taylor . Did you hear the way he was talking to me ? He was talking to me all different . All different than before . He was n't nice at all . MALCOLM Mrs. Tate , what are we going to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should we do ? MALCOLM Well , she has to stay in overnight , and if you do n't want her back home she can be arraigned in juvenile court . p. 81 ELLA We 're all leaving here though . Everyone has to leave . She ca n't come home . There would n't be anyone here . MALCOLM You 'll have to sign a statement then . ELLA What statement ? MALCOLM Giving permission for the arraignment . ELLA All right . MALCOLM You 'll have to come down with me unless you have a car . ELLA I have a car . ( pause ) Everyone 's run away . MALCOLM Will you be all right by yourself ? ELLA I am by myself . MALCOLM Yes , I know . Will you be all right or do you want to come with me in the patrol car ? ELLA I 'll be all right . MALCOLM I 'll wait for you down at the station then . ( MALCOLM exits . ELLA just stands there . ) ELLA ( to herself ) Everybody ran away . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLA jumps . They look at each other for a moment , then ELLA runs off stage . WESTON just stays sitting up on the table . He looks around the stage . He gets to his feet and tries to steady himself . He walks toward the refrigerator and kicks the artichokes out of his way . He opens refrigerator and looks in . Lights slowly fade to black with WESTON standing there looking into refrigerator. ) @x ( to lamb as he folds clothes ) There 's worse things than maggots ya ' know . Much worse . Maggots go away if they 're properly attended to . If you got someone around who can take the time . Who can recognize the signs . Who brings ya ' in out of the cold , wet pasture and sets ya ' up in a cushy situation like this . No lamb ever had it better . It 's warm . It 's free of draft , now that I got the new door up . There 's no varmints . No coyotes . No eagles . No  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about eagles ? This is a true story . This is a true account . One time I was out in the fields doing the castrating , which is a thing that has to be done . It 's not my favorite job , but it 's something that just has to be done . I 'd set myself up right beside the lean-to out there . Just a little roof-shelter thing out there with my best knife , some boiling water , and a hot iron to cauterize with . It 's a bloody job on all accounts . Well , I had maybe a dozen spring ram lambs to do out there . I had ' em all gathered up away from the ewes in much the same kinda ' set up as you got right there . Similar fence structure like that . It was a crisp , bright type a ' morning . Air was real thin and you could see all the way out across the pasture land . Frost was still well bit down on the stems , right close to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about their babies , and that was the only sound . Well , I was working away out there when I feel this shadow cross over me . I could feel it even before I saw it take shape on the ground . Felt like the way it does when the clouds move across the sun . Huge and black and cold like . So I look up , half expecting a buzzard or maybe a red-tail , but what hits me across the eyes is this giant eagle . Now I 'm a flyer and I 'm used to aeronautics , but this sucker was doin ' some downright suicidal antics . Real low down like he 's coming in for a landing or something , then changing his mind and pulling straight up again and sailing out away from me . So I watch him going small for a while , then turn back to my work . I do a couple more lambs maybe , and the same thing happens . Except this time he 's even lower yet . Like I could almost feel his feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . A giant bird . His wings made a kind of cracking noise . Then up he went again . I watched him longer this time , trying to figure out his intentions . Then I put the whole thing together . He was after those testes . Those fresh little remnants of manlihood . So I decided to oblige him this time and threw a few a ' them on top a ' the shed roof . Then I just went back to work again , pretending to be preoccupied . I was waitin ' for him this time though . I was listening hard for him , knowing he 'd be coming in from behind me . I was watchin ' the ground for any sign of blackness . Nothing happened for about three more lambs , when all of a sudden he comes . Just like a thunder clap . Blam ! He 's down on that shed roof with his talons taking half the tar paper with him , wings whippin ' the air , screaming like a bred mare then climbing straight back up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one . Somethin ' brought me straight up off the ground and I started yellin ' my head off . I do n't know why it was comin ' outa ' me but I was standing there with this icy feeling up my backbone and just yelling my fool head off . Cheerin ' for that eagle . I 'd never felt like that since the first day I went up in a B-49 . After a while I sat down again and went on workin ' . And every time I cut a lamb I 'd throw those balls up on top a ' the shed roof . And every time he 'd come down like the Cannonball Express on that roof . And every time I got that feeling . ( WESLEY appears stage right with his face and hands bloody. ) p. 84 WESLEY Then what ? WESTON Were you listening to me ? WESLEY What happens next ? WESTON I was tellin ' it to the lamb ! WESLEY Tell it to me . WESTON You 've already heard it . What happened to your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't ya ' go clean up . WESLEY What happens next ? WESTON I ai n't tellin ' it again ! WESLEY Then I ai n't cleaning up ! WESTON What 's the matter with you anyway ? Are you drunk or something ? WESLEY I was trying to get your money back . WESTON What money ? WESLEY From Ellis . WESTON That punk . Do n't waste your time . He 's a punk crook . WESLEY He ran off with your money . And he 's got the house too . WESLEY I 've got the house ! I 've decided to stay . WESLEY What ? p. 85 WESTON I 'm stayin ' . I finished the new door . Did you notice ? WESLEY No . WESTON Well , you shoulda ' noticed . You walked right through it . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm fixin ' the whole place up . I decided . WESLEY You 're fixing it up ? WESTON Yeah . That 's what I said . What 's so unusual about that ? This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Why do n't you have some coffee and clean yourself up a little . You look like forty miles a ' rough road . Go ahead . There 's fresh coffee on the stove . ( WESLEY crosses slowly to the stove and looks at the coffee . ) WESTON I got up and took a walk around the place . Bright and early . Do n't think I 've walked around the whole place for a couple a ' years . I walked around and a funny thing started happening to me . WESLEY ( looking at coffee ) What ? WESTON I started wondering who this was walking around in the orchard at six-thirty in the morning . It did n't feel like me . It was some character in a dark overcoat and tennis shoes and a baseball cap and stickers comin ' out of his face . It did n't feel like the owner of a piece a ' property as nice as this . Then I started to wonder who the owner was . I mean if I did n't feel like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if the real owner was gon na ' pop up out of nowhere and blast my brains out for trespassing . I started feeling like I should be running or hiding or something . Like I should n't be there in this kind of a neighborhood . Not that it 's fancy or anything , but it 's peaceful . It 's real peaceful up here . Especially at that time a ' the morning . Then it struck me that I actually was the owner . That somehow it was me and I was actually the one walking on my own piece of land . And that gave me a great feeling . p. 86 WESLEY ( staring at coffee ) It did ? WESTON Yeah . So I came back in here , and the first thing I did was I took all my old clothes off and walked around here naked . Just walked through the whole damn house in my birthday suit . Tried to get the feeling of it really being me in my own house . It was like peeling off a whole person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made myself a hot bath . Hot as I could stand it . Just sank down into it and let it sink deep into the skin . Let it fog up all the windows and the glass on the medicine cabinet . Then I let all the water drain out , and then I filled the whole tub up again but this time with ice cold water . Just sat there and let it creep up on me until I was in up to my neck . Then I got out and took a shave and found myself some clean clothes . Then I came in here and fixed myself a big old breakfast of ham and eggs . WESLEY Ham and eggs ? WESTON Yeah . Somebody left a whole mess a ' groceries in the ice box . Surprised the hell outa ' me . Just like Christmas . Just like somebody knew I was gon na ' be reborn this morning or something . Could n't believe my eyes . ( WESLEY goes to refrigerator and looks in . ) WESTON Then I started makin ' coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Like I was coming back to my life after a long time a ' being away . p. 87 WESLEY ( staring in refrigerator ) Mom brought this stuff . WESTON Then I started doing the laundry . All the laundry . I went around the house and found all the piles of dirty clothes I could get my hands on . Emma 's , Ella 's , even some a ' yours . Some a ' your socks . Found everybody 's clothes . And every time I bent down to pick up somebody 's clothes I could feel that person like they were right there in the room . Like the clothes were still attached to the person they belonged to . And I felt like I knew every single one of you . Every one . Like I knew you through the flesh and blood . Like our bodies were connected and we could never escape that . But I did n't feel like escaping . I felt like it was a good thing . It was good to be connected by blood like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an animal thing . It was a reason of nature that we were all together under the same roof . Not that we had to be but that we were supposed to be . And I started feeling glad about it . I started feeling full of hope . WESLEY ( staring in refrigerator ) I 'm starving . WESTON ( crossing to WESLEY ) Look , go take a bath and get that crap off your face , and I 'll make ya ' some ham and eggs . What is that crap anyway ? p. 88 WESLEY Blood . WESTON He took a few swipes at ya ' , huh ? Well go wash it off and come back in here . Go on ! WESLEY ( turning toWESTON ) He would n't give me the money , you know . WESTON So what . The guy 's a knuckle-head . Do n't have the brains God gave a chicken . Now go in there and clean up before I start swingin ' on you . ( WESLEY exits off left . WESTON starts taking ham and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . He yells off stage to WESLEY as he cooks . ) WESTON ( yelling ) So I was thinkin ' about that avocado deal you were talkin ' about before ! You know , joining up with the " Growers Association " and everything ! And I was thinkin ' it might not be such a bad deal after all ! I mean we do n't have to hire Chicanos or nothin ' ! We could pick ' em ourselves and sell ' em direct to the company ! How ' bout that idea ! Cut down on the overhead ! That tractor 's still workin ' , is n't it ? I mean the motor 's not seized up or nothin ' , and we got plenty a ' good pressure in the irrigation ! I checked it this morning ! Water 's blastin ' right through those pipes ! Would n't take much to get the whole operation goin ' full-tilt again ! I 'll resell that piece a ' land out there ! That 'll give us somethin ' to get us started ! Somebody somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert land ! It 's prime location even if it is n't being developed ! Only a three-hour drive from Palm Springs , and you know what that 's like ! You know the kinda ' people who frequent that place ! One of ' em 's bound to have some extra cash ! ( ELLA enters from stage right . She looks haggard and tired . She stands there looking at WESTON , who keeps cooking the eggs . Then she looks at the lamb . WESTON knows she 's there but does n't look at her. ) p. 89 ELLA ( after pause ) What 's that lamb doing back in here ? WESTON I got him back on his feet . It was nip and tuck there for a while . Did n't think he 'd pull through . Maggots clear up into the small intestine . ELLA ( crossing to table ) Spare me the details . ( She pulls off her white gloves and sits exhausted into the chair at stage right . She looks at the piles of clean laundry . ) WESTON ( still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WESTON Oh , they finally caught ya ' , huh ? ( chuckles ) ELLA Very humorous . WESTON You want some breakfast ? I was just fixin ' something up for Wes , here . ELLA You 're cooking ? WESTON Yeah . What 's it look like ? ELLA Who did all this laundry ? WESTON Yours truly . ELLA Are you having a nervous breakdown or what ? WESTON Ca n't a man do his own laundry ? p. 90 ELLA As far as I know he can . WESTON Even did some a ' yours too . ELLA Gee , thanks . WESTON Well , I coulda ' just left it . I was doin ' a load of my own , so I thought I 'd throw everybody else 's in to boot . ELLA I 'm very grateful . WESTON So where you been ? Off with that fancy lawyer ? ELLA I 've been to jail , like I said . WESTON Come on . What , on a visit ? They throw you in the drunk tank ? Out with it . ELLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 'd they nab her for ? ELLA Possession of firearms . Malicious vandalism . Breaking and entering . Assault . Violation of equestrian regulations . You name it . WESTON Well , she always was a fireball . ELLA Part of the inheritance , right ? WESTON Right . Direct descendant . ELLA Well , I 'm glad you 've found a way of turning shame into a source of pride . WESTON What 's shameful about it ? Takes courage to get charged with all that stuff . It 's not everyone her age who can run up a list of credits like that . p. 91 ELLA That 's for sure . WESTON Could you ? ELLA Do n't be ridiculous ! I 'm not self-destructive . Does n't run in my family line . WESTON That 's right . I never thought about it like that . You 're the only one who does n't have it . Only us . ELLA Oh , so now I 'm the outsider . WESTON Well , it 's true . You come from a different class of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't they ? ELLA My grandfather was a pharmacist . WESTON Well , scientists then . Members of the professions . Professionals . Nobody raised their voice . ELLA That 's bad ? WESTON No . Just different . That 's all . Just different . ELLA Are we waxing philosophical over our eggs now ? Is that the idea ? Sobered up over night , have we ? Awoken to a brand-new morning ? What is this crap ! I 've been down there all night trying to pull Emma back together again and I come back to Mr. Hyde ! Mr. " Goody Two-Shoes " ! Mister Mia Copa himself ! Well , you can kiss off with that crap because I 'm not buying it ! WESTON Would you like some coffee ? p. 92 ELLA NO , I DO N'T WANT ANY GODDAMN COFFEE ! AND GET THAT SON-OF-A-BITCHING SHEEP OUT OF MY KITCHEN ! ! WESTON ( staying cool ) You 've picked up on the language okay , but your inflection 's off . ELLA There 's nothing wrong with my inflection ! WESTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the voice . At the heart of things . ELLA Oh , you are really something . How can you accuse me of not measuring up to your standards ! You 're a complete washout ! WESTON It 's got nothing to do with standards . It 's more like fate . ELLA Oh , knock it off , would you ? I 'm exhausted . WESTON Try the table . Nice and hard . It 'll do wonders for you . ELLA ( suddenly soft ) The table ? WESTON Yeah . Just stretch yourself out . You 'll be amazed . Better than any bed . ( ELLA looks at the table for a second , then starts pushing all the clean laundry off it onto the floor . She pulls herself up onto it and stretches out on it . WESTON goes on cooking with his back to her . She watches him as she lies there. ) p. 93 WESTON And when you wake up I 'll have a great big breakfast of ham and eggs , ready and waiting . You 'll feel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those years in bed , once you feel that table . That table will deliver you . ( WESLEY wanders on stage from stage left , completely naked , his hair wet . He looks dazed . WESTON pays no attention but goes on preparing the breakfast and talking as WESLEY wanders upstage and stares at ELLA . She looks at him but does n't react . He turns downstage and looks at WESTON . He looks at lamb and crosses down to it . He bends over and picks it up , then carries it off stage right . WESTON goes on cooking and talking . ELLA stays on table . ) WESTON That 's the trouble with too much comfort , you know ? Makes you forget where you come from . Makes you lose touch . You think you 're making headway but you 're losing all the time . You 're falling behind more and more . You 're going into a trance that you 'll never come back from . You 're being hypnotized . Your body 's being mesmerized . You go into a coma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while to bring you back . A good hard table to bring you back to life . ELLA ( still on table , sleepily ) You should have been a preacher . WESTON You think so ? p. 94 ELLA Great voice you have . Deep . Resonates . WESTON ( putting eggs on plate ) I 'm not a public person . ELLA I 'm so exhausted . WESTON You just sleep . ELLA You should have seen that jail , Weston . WESTON I have . ELLA Oh , that 's right . How could you ever sleep in a place like that ? WESTON If you 're numb enough you do n't feel a thing . ( he yells off stage to WESLEY ) WES ! YOUR BREAKFAST 'S READY ! ELLA He just went out . WESTON What ? ELLA He just walked out stark naked with that sheep under his arm . ( WESTON looks at fence enclosure , sees lamb gone . He 's still holding plate . ) WESTON Where 'd he go ? ELLA Outside . WESTON ( crossing right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ READY ! ( WESTON exits carrying plate off stage right . ELLA tries to keep her eyes open , still on table. ) p. 95 ELLA ( to herself ) Nothing surprises me anymore . ( She slowly falls asleep on table . Nothing happens for a while . Then WESTON comes back on from right still carrying plate . ELLA stays asleep on table . ) WESTON ( crossing to stove ) He 's not out there . Would n't ya ' know it ? Just when it 's ready , he walks out . ( turning to ELLA ) Why 'd he take the lamb ? That lamb needs to be kept warm . ( sees that ELLA 'S sound asleep ) Great . ( turns and sets plate down on stove ; looks at food ) Might as well eat it myself . A double breakfast . Why not ? ( he starts eating off the plate , talks to himself ) Ca n't expect the thing to get well if it 's not kept warm . ( he turns upstage again and looks at ELLA sleeping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was best at talkin ' to myself . Always was the best thing . Nothing like it . Keeps ya ' company at least . ( WESLEY enters from right dressed in WESTON 'S baseball cap , overcoat , and tennis shoes . He stands there . WESTON looks at him . ELLA sleeps . ) WESTON What in the hell 's goin ' on with you ? I was yellin ' for you just now . Did n't you hear me ? p. 96 WESLEY ( staring at WESTON ) No . WESTON Your breakfast was all ready . Now it 's cold . I 've eaten half of it already . Almost half gone . WESLEY ( blankly ) You can have it . WESTON What 're you doin ' in those clothes anyway ? WESLEY I found them . WESTON I threw them out ! What 's got into you ? You go take a bath and then put on some old bum 's clothes that 've been thrown-up in , pissed in , and God knows what all in ? WESLEY They fit me . WESTON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 'd you do with that lamb ? WESLEY Butchered it . WESTON ( turning away from him , disgusted ) I swear to God . ( pause , then turning to WESLEY ) WHAT 'D YA ' BUTCHER THE DUMB THING FOR ! WESLEY We need some food . WESTON THE ICE BOX IS CRAMMED FULL A ' FOOD ! ( WESLEY crosses quickly to refrigerator , opens it , and starts pulling all kinds of food out and eating it ravenously . WESTON watches him , a little afraid of WESLEY 'S state. ) p. 97 WESTON WHAT 'D YA ' GO AND BUTCHER IT FOR ? HE WAS GETTING BETTER ! ( watches WESLEY eating hungrily ) What 's a ' matter with you , boy ? I made ya ' a big breakfast . Why did n't ya ' eat that ? What 's the matter with you ? ( WESTON moves cautiously , away from WESLEY to stage right . WESLEY keeps eating , throwing half-eaten food to one side and then digging into more . He groans slightly as he eats . ) WESTON ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' the chores around the place and you had to do it instead a ' me . But I brought you some artichokes back , did n't I ? Did n't I do that ? I did n't have to do that . I went outa ' my way . I saw the sign on the highway and drove two miles outa ' my way just to bring you back some artichokes . ( pause , as he looks at WESLEY eating ; he glances nervously up at ELLA , then back to WESLEY ) You could n't be all that starving ! We 're not that bad off , goddamnit ! I 've seen starving people in my time , and we 're not that bad off ! ( pause , no reaction from WESLEY , who continues to eat ravenously ) You just been spoiled , that 's all ! This is a paradise for a young person ! There 's kids your age who 'd give their eyeteeth to have an environment like this to grow up in ! You 've got everything ! Everything ! Opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward ELLA ) ELLA ! ELLA , WAKE UP ! ( no reaction from ELLA ; turns back to WESLEY , still eating ) If this is supposed to make me feel guilty , it 's not working ! It 's not working because I do n't have to pay for my past now ! Not now ! Not after this morning ! All that 's behind me now ! YOU UNDERSTAND ME ? IT 'S ALL OVER WITH BECAUSE I 'VE BEEN REBORN ! I 'M A WHOLE NEW PERSON NOW ! I 'm a whole new person . ( WESLEY stops eating suddenly and turns to WESTON. ) p. 98 WESLEY ( coldly ) They 're going to kill you . WESTON ( pause ) Who 's going to kill me ! What 're you talking about ! Nobody 's going to kill me ! WESLEY I could n't get the money . WESTON What money ? WESLEY Ellis . WESTON So what ? WESLEY You owe it to them . WESTON Owe it to who ? I do n't remember anything . All that 's over with now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there . Maybe you 've changed , but you still owe them . WESTON I ca n't remember . Must 've borrowed some for the car payment . Ca n't remember it . WESLEY They remember it . WESTON So , I 'll get it to them . It 's not that drastic . WESLEY How ? Ellis has the house and everything now . WESTON How does he have the house ? This is my house ! WESLEY You signed it over . WESTON I never signed anything ! WESLEY You were drunk . p. 99 WESTON SHUT UP ! WESLEY How 're you going to pay them ? WESTON ( pause ) I can sell that land . WESLEY It 's phony land . The guy 's run off to Mexico . WESTON What guy ? WESLEY Taylor . The lawyer . The lawyer friend of Mom 's . WESTON ( pause , looks at ELLA sleeping , then back to WESLEY ) Same guy ? WESLEY Same guy . Ripped us all off . WESTON This is n't right . I was on a whole new track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . WESLEY They 've got it worked out so you ca n't . WESTON I was ready for a whole new attack . This is n't right ! WESLEY They 've moved in on us like a creeping disease . We did n't even notice . WESTON I just built a whole new door and everything . I washed all the laundry . I cleaned up all the artichokes . I started over . WESLEY You better run . WESTON Run ? What do you mean , run ? I ca n't run ! p. 100 WESLEY Take the Packard and get out of here . WESTON I ca n't run out on everything . WESLEY Why not ? WESTON ' CAUSE THIS IS WHERE I SETTLED DOWN ! THIS IS WHERE THE LINE ENDED ! RIGHT HERE ! I MIGRATED TO THIS SPOT ! I GOT NOWHERE TO GO TO ! THIS IS IT ! WESLEY Take the Packard . ( WESTON stands there for a while . He looks around , trying to figure a way out . ) WESTON ( after pause ) I remember now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my elbows . See , I always figured on the future . I banked on it . I was banking on it getting better . It could n't get worse , so I figured it 'd just get better . I figured that 's why everyone wants you to buy things . Buy refrigerators . Buy cars , houses , lots , invest . They would n't be so generous if they did n't figure you had it comin ' in . At some point it had to be comin ' in . So I went along with it . Why not borrow if you know it 's coming in . Why not make a touch here and there . They all want you to borrow anyhow . Banks , car lots , investors . The whole thing 's geared to invisible money . You never hear the sound of change anymore . It 's all plastic shuffling back and forth . It 's all in everybody 's heads . So I figured if that 's the case , why not take advantage of it ? Why not go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers ? If it 's all an idea and nothing 's really there , why not take advantage ? So I just went along with it , that 's all . I just played ball . p. 101 WESLEY You better go . ( Pause , as WESTON looks at ELLA sleeping . ) WESTON Same guy , huh ? She musta ' known about it , too . She musta ' thought I left her . ( WESTON turns and looks at WESLEY . Silence . ) WESLEY You did . WESTON I just went off for a little while . Now and then . I could n't stand it here . I could n't stand the idea that everything would stay the same . That every morning it would be the same . I kept looking for it out there somewhere . I kept trying to piece it together . The jumps . I could n't figure out the jumps . From being born , to growing up , to droppin ' bombs , to having kids , to hittin ' bars , to this . It all turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept looking for it out there somewhere . And all the time it was right inside this house . WESLEY They 'll be coming for you here . They know where you live now . WESTON Where should I go ? WESLEY How ' bout Mexico ? WESTON Mexico ? Yeah . That 's where everyone escapes to , right ? It 's full of escape artists down there . I could go down there and get lost . I could disappear . I could start a whole new life down there . p. 102 WESLEY Maybe . WESTON I could find that guy and get my money back . That real estate guy . What 's his name ? WESLEY Taylor . WESTON Yeah , Taylor . He 's down there too , right ? I could find him . WESLEY Maybe . WESTON ( looking over at ELLA again ) I ca n't believe she knew and still went off with him . She musta ' thought I was dead or something . She musta ' thought I was never coming back . ( WESTON moves toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turns and exits off right . WESLEY just stands there . WESLEY bends down and picks some scraps of food up off the floor and eats them very slowly . He looks at the empty lamb pen . EMMA enters from left , dressed as she was in Act 2 . She crosses into center , looking in the direction of where WESTON went . WESLEY seems dazed as he slowly chews the food . ELLA stays asleep on table . EMMA carries a riding crop . She taps her leg with it as she looks off right . ) EMMA Mexico , huh ? He wo n't last a day down there . They 'll find him easy . Stupid going to Mexico . That 's the first place they 'll look . ( to WESLEY ) What 're you eating ? p. 103 WESLEY Food . EMMA Off the floor ? You 'll wind up just like him . Diseased ! WESLEY ( dazed ) I 'm hungry . EMMA You 're sick ! What 're you doing with his clothes on ? Are you supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Cheese ? Daddy Bear ? WESLEY I tried his remedy , but it did n't work . EMMA He 's got a remedy ? WESLEY ( half to himself ) I tried taking a hot bath . Hot as I could stand it . Then freezing cold . Then walking around naked . But it did n't work . Nothing happened . I was waiting for something to happen . I went outside . I was freezing cold out there and I looked for something to put over me . I started digging around in the garbage and I found his clothes . EMMA Digging around in the garbage ? WESLEY I had the lamb 's blood dripping down my arms . I thought it was me for a second . I thought it was me bleeding . EMMA You 're disgusting . You 're even more disgusting than him . And that 's pretty disgusting . ( looking at ELLA , still asleep ) What 's she doing ? p. 104 WESLEY I started putting all his clothes on . His baseball cap , his tennis shoes , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like a part of him was growing on me . I could feel him taking over me . EMMA ( crossing up to table , tapping crop on her leg ) What is she , asleep or something ? ( she whacks ELLA across the butt with the riding crop ) WAKE UP ! ( ELLA stays sleeping ) WESLEY I could feel myself retreating . I could feel him coming in and me going out . Just like the change of the guards . EMMA Well , do n't eat your heart out about it . You did the best you could . WESLEY I did n't do a thing . EMMA That 's what I mean . WESLEY I just grew up here . EMMA ( crossing down to WESLEY ) Have you got any money ? ( WESLEY starts digging around in the pockets of the overcoat . ) EMMA What 're you fishing around in there for ? That 's his coat . WESLEY I thought you were supposed to be in jail ? p. 105 EMMA ( crossing back up to table ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLA 'S handbag and going through it ) I used my ingenuity . I made use of my innate criminal intelligence . ( EMMA throws things onto the floor from ELLA 'S pocket book as she searches through it . ) WESLEY What 'd you do ? EMMA I got out . WESLEY I know , but how ? EMMA I made sexual overtures to the sergeant . That 's how . Easy . ( She takes a big wad of money out of pocket book and a set of car keys , then throws the bag away . She holds up the money . ) EMMA I 'm going into crime . It 's the only thing that pays these days . WESLEY ( looking at roll of bills in EMMA 'S hand ) Where 'd she get that ? EMMA Where do you think ? WESLEY You 're taking her car ? EMMA It 's the perfect self-employment . Crime . No credentials . No diplomas . No overhead . No upkeep . Just straight profit . Right off the top . p. 106 WESLEY How come I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because you do n't look ahead . That 's why . You do n't see the writing on the wall . You got ta learn how to read these things , Wes . It 's deadly otherwise . You ca n't believe people when they look you in the eyes . You got ta ' look behind them . See what they 're standing in front of . What they 're hiding . Everybody 's hiding , Wes . Everybody . Nobody looks like what they are . WESLEY What are you ? EMMA ( moving away ) I 'm gone . I 'm gone ! Never to return . ( ELLA suddenly wakes up on the table . She sits up straight . ) ELLA ( as though waking from a bad dream ) EMMA ! ! ( EMMA looks at her , then runs off stage left . ELLA sits there on table staring in horror at WESLEY . She does n't recognize him . ) ELLA ( to WESLEY ) Weston ! Was that Emma ? WESLEY It 's me , Mom . ELLA ( yelling off stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps off table and looks for a coat ) We 've got to catch her ! She ca n't run off like that ! That horse will kill her ! Where 's my coat ? ( to WESLEY ) WHERE 'S MY COAT ? p. 107 WESLEY You were n't wearing one . ELLA ( to WESLEY ) Go catch her , Weston ! She 's your daughter ! She 's trying to run away ! WESLEY Let her go . ELLA I ca n't let her go ! I 'm responsible ! ( Huge explosion off stage . Flash of light , then silence . WESLEY and ELLA just stand there staring . EMERSON enters from right , giggling . He 's a small man in a suit . ) EMERSON Jeeezus ! Did you ever hear a thing like that ? What a wallop ! Jeezus Christ ! ( giggles ) ( WESLEY and ELLA look at him . ) EMERSON Old Slater musta ' packed it brim full . I never heard such a godalmighty bang in my whole career . ( SLATER , his partner , enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's taller than EMERSON , also in a suit . They both giggle as though they 'd pulled off a halloween stunt . ) SLATER Emerson , get a load a'this ! ( giggling ) Did you see this thing ? ( to WESLEY ) What is this , a skinned goat ? WESLEY ( blank ) Lamb . p. 108 SLATER Oh , it 's a lamb ! ( they laugh ) Looks like somebody 's afterbirth to me ! ( they laugh hysterically ) WESLEY What was that bang ? ( They stop laughing and look at WESLEY . They laugh again , then stop . ) EMERSON Bang ? What bang ? WESLEY That explosion . EMERSON Oh that ! That was just a little reminder . A kind of a post-hypnotic suggestion . ( they laugh ) ELLA Who are these men , Weston ? EMERSON ( to WESLEY ) Weston ? You 're Weston ? WESLEY My father . EMERSON ( to SLATER ) Looks a little young , do n't ya ' think ? SLATER ( dropping lamb carcass into fence enclosure ) Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Weston . ELLA What are these men doing here ? ( she moves away from them ) EMERSON ( to WESLEY ) So you 're Weston ? We had a different picture in mind . We had someone altogether different in mind . p. 109 WESLEY What was it that blew up out there ? EMERSON Something that was n't paid for . Something past due . SLATER Long overdue . WESLEY The car . You blew up the car . EMERSON Bingo ! ( They crack up . WESLEY moves upstage and looks out as though trying to see outside . ) ELLA Get these men out of here , Weston ! They 're in my kitchen . SLATER ( looking around ) Some mess in here , boy . I could n't live like this if you paid me . EMERSON Well , that 's what comes from not paying your bills . You let one thing slide ; first thing you know you let everything slide . You let everything go downhill until you wind up in a dungheap like this . WESLEY ( looking out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll go out . It 's just a gelignite-nitro mixture . Does n't burn for long . May leave a few scars on the lawn but nothin ' permanent . WESLEY ( without emotion , still looking out ) Nothing left of the car . p. 110 SLATER That 's right . Very thorough . The Irish developed it . Beautiful stuff . Never know what hit ya ' . EMERSON ( to WESLEY ) Well , we got ta ' run , Weston . But you can get the general drift . ( they start to leave ; EMERSON stops ) Oh , and if you see your old man , you might pass on the info . We hate to keep repeating ourselves . The first time is great , but after that it gets pretty boring . SLATER ( to WESLEY ) Do n't forget to give that lamb some milk . He looks pretty bad off . ( They both laugh loudly , then exit . ELLA is facing downstage now , staring at the lamb carcass in the pen . WESLEY has his back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLA ( staring at dead lamb ) I must 've slept right through the day . How long did I sleep ? ( They stay in these positions facing away from each other . ) WESLEY Not so long . ELLA And Emma left . She really left on that horse . I did n't think she 'd do it . I had a dream she was leaving . That 's what woke me up . WESLEY She was right here in the kitchen . p. 111 ELLA I must 've slept right through it . ( pause , as she stares at lamb carcass ) Oh ! You know what , Wes ? WESLEY What ? ELLA Something just went right through me . Just from looking at this lamb . WESLEY What ? ELLA That story your father used to tell about that eagle . You remember that ? WESLEY Yeah . ELLA You remember the whole thing ? WESLEY Yeah . ELLA I do n't . I remember something about it . But it just went right through me . WESLEY Oh . ELLA ( after pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shed roof and then flying off . WESLEY Yeah . ELLA What else ? WESLEY I do n't know . ELLA You remember . What happens next ? WESLEY A cat comes . ELLA That 's right . A big tom cat comes . Right out in the fields . And he jumps up on top of that roof to sniff around in all the entrails or whatever it was . p. 112 WESLEY ( still with back to her ) And that eagle comes down and picks up the cat in his talons and carries him screaming off into the sky . ELLA ( staring at lamb ) That 's right . And they fight . They fight like crazy in the middle of the sky . That cat 's tearing his chest out , and the eagle 's trying to drop him , but the cat wo n't let go because he knows if he falls he 'll die . WESLEY And the eagle 's being torn apart in midair . The eagle 's trying to free himself from the cat , and the cat wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Both of them come crashing down . Like one whole thing . ( They stay like that with WESLEY looking off upstage , his back to ELLA , and ELLA downstage , looking at the lamb . Lights fade very slowly to black. )
