txt // 89 . Jointing Cardboard Rigid cardboard can be glued ( see 10 ? 26 ) surface to surface , surface to edge , or edge to edge ( see diag. 89. a ) . It can be taped together with paper packaging tape or plastic strapping tape , or scored ( see 88 ) . It can also be slot jointed ( see 61 ) . Layers of cardboard can he laminated and built up to be jointed like wood . For example , two layers of cardboard , one smaller all around and centered on the larger of the two , form lap joints all around ( see diag. 89. b ) . These can he glued or taped to other lap jointed shapes and , if necessary , supported by braces glued into corners for additional strength . Many of the standard wood joints ( see III.E ) can be built up and used in cardboard constructions . 90 . Flexible , Fluted Cardboard Strips Flexible , fluted cardboard , more malleable than the corrugated kind , can be bought in rolls or found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for large appliances . It can be cut into strips with scissors or a knife , bent parallel with the fluting ( cut-scored for folds at right angles to the fluting ) , rolled , curved and coiled , glued , taped , or stapled to itself and to other materials . It is especially useful for making armatures ( see 51 ? 54 and 277 ) and as a base for papier mache , clay , or plaster panoramas or landscapes . 91 . Corrugated Cardboard Cut-apart grocery cartons or sheets of corrugated board available from stationery stores , storage warehouses , and movers can be cut into various shapes with a sharp knife blade or with a coping saw , jigsaw , 91 keyhole saw , or back saw ( see 85 ) . It can be bent parallel to the fluting without scoring . Bends at right angles to the fluting require cut scores ( see 64 ) . Several layers of corrugated board , laminated to each other , are sufficiently strong for large collages , assemblages , and life-size , usable tables , chairs , storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material , building blocks , and toy vehicles on which the child can ride , and life-size doll houses and play stores . Slot construction ( see 61 ) provides greatest strength and flexibility . Tape the edges of finished corrugated board constructions with packaging tape to prevent fraying and separation of the cover papers from the fluting . Corrugated board can be painted like any other paper or cardboard ( see 83 ) . 92 . Cardboard Tubes Cardboard tubes , cut into different lengths with a sharp knife blade , coping saw , jigsaw , keyhole saw , or back saw ( see 85 ) , are useful in three-dimensional design , in assemblages , or as components like table and chair legs in combination with other materials . They can be pasted , tied , taped , or jointed . Semicircular cross-laps can be cut into the ends of cardboard tubes with a saw . Use one such cutoff as a template for marking identical joints into other tube ends . Several tubes , notched in this manner , will fit together like logs used to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube ends can fit to slot jointed flat cardboard shapes ( see diag. 92. b ) . // 93 . Construction Details Cardboard in all its different forms lends itself to bold , abstract design as well as to fine detail , depending on the young craftsman 's purpose , conception , and skill level . Three-dimensional shapes can be built up out of successive layers of smaller shapes , each following a desired contour and glued to the last ( see diag. 93. a ) . Solid geometric constructions can be built with cardboard , following the principles for paper construction ( see 73 ? 82 ) . The cardboard must be cut-scored ( see 64 ) or else the individual shapes taped together with packaging or strapping tape . Lighterweight cardboard can be moistened or steamed and then bent , glued , or nailed in position to hold its shape . To make more complex , convolute , or undulating cardboard constructions ? for a model landscape or bridge , for example ? build up a skeleton framework out of cardboard . When this frame is complete ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard , heavy paper , papier mache , or cloth ( see 48 ? 59 and 90 ) . Similar cardboard constructions can be used as armatures for clay ( see VII ) . 93 Accordion-folded paper and corners of paper constructions can be reinforced with cardboard to give them rigidity ( see 95 ) . Finally , cardboard templates ( see 68 and 123 ) are useful for preparatory work with other materials . 94 . Designing for Cardboard Construction Cardboard is useful and satisfying for both spontaneous and planned design . When making utilitarian objects and others requiring close-fitting parts , it is best to make a paper mock-up first to avoid unnecessary mistakes and cutting . ( See 73 ? 82 and XII for simple layout and design suggestions. ) 95 . Reinforcing Cardboard Construction Cardboard constructions can be strengthened by fitting and fastening wood , lath , balsa , leather , or cloth to joints and other places that require support ( see diag. 95 ) . 96 . Cardboard Colleges Cardboard , fluted board , and corrugated board are versatile materials for collages , used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 111 , 177 , and 300 ) . 97 . Cardboard Assemblages The relative ease and speed with which constructions can be built out of various kinds of cardboard make them ideal for framework and detail in combination with other found and natural materials ( see 28 ) . // K. PAPER SCULPTURE 98 . Formed Paper Relief Table Paper can be sculpted in relief by cutting , scoring , and folding ( see 30-35 , 41-43 , and 60-82 ) , using the same techniques as those required to form fully three-dimensional paper objects and shapes . Such sculpture should not be attempted until the different methods of paper folding , cutting , and scoring have been explored . For spontaneous paper sculpture a wood or heavy cardboard base is essential . Paper shapes can be curved and curled and attached to it with tape , paste , or staples . These shapes can be given three-dimensional detail and texture ( see 63 ) . L. MAKING DECORATIVE PAPERS 99 . Techniques and Methods Paper making is beyond the scope of this book ( see II.A ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see 9-27 ) , printing ( see VIII ) , drawing , and the techniques described below ( see 100-102 ) . Such decorative papers can be used in paper constructions , collages , assemblages , sculpting , and making useful objects , and for bookbinding ( see II.M ) . 100 . Spatter and Stippling Table Prepare thick poster paint mixtures , each color in its own muffin cup . Show the child how to dip sponge or brush into the paint and then dab it 95 lightly onto the paper . The lighter the touch , the more interesting and varied the effects will be . After stippling one sheet with a single color , wash out the sponge or brush , squeeze it dry , and use a second color , as before . A third color and more can be added in turn , either while previous coatings are still wet or after they have dried . A great many different effects and color mixtures can be achieved in this way . ( See also 216 and 319 for additional spatter effects. ) 101 . Ink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several layers of newspaper or onto heavy blotting paper . Moisten the drawing paper with water and sponge . Drop blots of colored ink onto the moistened paper , using the eyedropper . The inks will crawl and bleed , creating a variety of patterns and designs . Several different colors can be used in succession . Additional variation can be achieved by dropping small amounts of soapy water into the design , again using an eyedropper . Do not disturb or move the paper until the water and inks have dried thoroughly . Such moistened paper can also be flooded with watercolor applied with a brush , which is then drawn into with colored felt markers and drawing pens dipped into India ink . These and other " resist " methods ( see 219 and 229 ? 231 ) can be combined with each other . 102 . Marbled Paper Table // Dilute the wallpaper paste with water to the consistency of smooth light cream . Make sure no lumps remain . Pour enough of this mixture into one of the trays so that it covers the bottom to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with turpentine as many of the oil colors as are to be used , one color to each muffin tin cup , using a different tongue depressor to stir each . Using a different eyedropper for each color , drop a little blob of the oil paints into the paste mixture in the tray . Each droplet will spread and form a pattern on top of the surface of the paste , since oil and water do not mix . To achieve swirls of color , stir the paint with a clean tongue depressor . When the oil paint pattern is satisfactory , gently place a sheet of drawing paper on top of the oil-paint-design-covered paste in the tray . Do not submerge the paper , but let it float on top . Tap the top of the paper surface gently with finger or clean tongue depressor to force out air bubbles that might be trapped between paper and paste surface . Finally , lift the paper off the oil paint and paste surface , keeping it as level as possible . Turn the sheet over quickly and place it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agitate the water slightly to help remove any paste that may cling to the paper . Then remove the paper from its bath and let it dry , design side up , on a sheet of blotting paper or a stack of newsprint . Other substances , like oxgall or India ink , dropped into the first , **26;1121;TOOLONG tray , will permit an even greater variety of design effects and marbling . M. BOOKBINDING 103 . Gathering a Signature Books are printed on individual sheets , each containing several pages . Before the type is set the printer lays out a large imposition sheet the same size as the sheet to be printed , on which each separate page is indicated . When printed , the pages on each side of the sheet seem out of order , and many upside down . But each falls into its proper , consecutive place and can be read right side up once the sheet is folded . Each set of pages that fit onto such a sheet is called a signature . Most signatures contain multiples of sixteen pages-32 , 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the book , paper , and printing press . Large books may contain several signatures . To make a scrapbook , sketchbook , or other book , fold large sheets of paper into individual signatures of the required page size , using the suggested folds ( see diag. 103. a ) . Professional bookbinding requires special equipment and considerable strength . To avoid the need for both , young people can punch holes into the fold of each gathered signature , using a hole punch ( see 5 and 178 ) or a grommet die and hammer ( see 6 and 185 ) , or a stapler , and fasten the folded signature with grommets or paper clasps ( see diag. 103. b ) . If more than one signature is required , paste the last page of each to the first page of the next . Professional bookbinders glue , sew , and staple signatures to one another and to the spine of the binding . // Once the signature is folded , gathered , and fastened , slit the remaining folds on the three sides other than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper edges may be slightly ragged but this can be decorative , like the deckle edge of handmade papers . Trimming a signature with a knife is difficult ; do n't try it . In the bindery this is done on a guillotine . 104 . Portfolio Binding Table Lay out each of two covers for the book or portfolio about 1/4 " larger all around than any signature that is to be bound into it . Check all corners of the cardboard covers with a right-angle triangle to assure that they are perfectly square . Cut a strip of canvas as long as the covers are high and 2 " wider than the thickness of the signature or signatures . Paste this strip neatly to the two facing edges of the cardboard covers , leaving a space between them equal to the thickness of the signature plus twice the thickness of a cardboard cover ( see diag. 104. a ) . Fold over the ends of the canvas that extend beyond the spine , double them over , and paste them down . Now open the cardboard covers and canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " wrong " ( undecorated ) side of one of the decorative papers . Cut V-shaped notches at all corners of the boards and spine ( see diag. l04.b ) . Cover the spine with paste and glue it to the paper , 99 making sure to line up the V-shaped notches with the corners of the spine . Next close the covers , and cover the topmost side of one of the boards with paste . Glue the paper flap that extends beyond the spine on that side down to the board . Turn the binding over and repeat this operation on the other side . The reason for pasting the paper to the boards while the cover is closed is that , were they pasted while the cover lay open , the paper might crack at the folds when the book was folded . Now open the portfolio and paste all the flaps down over the various edges ( see diag. 104. c ) . Cut a second sheet of decorative paper , about 1/8 " smaller on all sides than the outside dimension of the book cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . Cover the inside , as yet uncovered boards and spine with paste , and glue the decorative paper to boards and spine . Wipe any excess paste off the paper with a damp cloth . If these are to be covers for a scrapbook , sketchbook , or other book or one that is to be re-bound , glue the first and last pages and the spine side of the gathered signatures to the inside covers and spine ( see diag. 104. d ) . I00 PAPER AND FOIL CRAFT If such a binding is to be a portfolio for loose sheets , prints or photographs , cut flaps out of black linen or construction paper for each of the three sides of one cover ( see diag. 104. e ) , and paste them in place before gluing the second , inside decorative paper to the binding . Holes drilled or punched under these flaps , with leather thong or lacing tied or glued in place , allow such a portfolio to be securely tied ( see diag. 104. f ) . III Carpentry Life without industry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruskin A. BACKGROUND Carpentry invokes the smell , feel , and texture of wood and wood shavings and of hand-held tools . Wood is a vanishing resource despite remaining forests of hardwood trees in South America and Australia and softwood " tree farms " in the northern hemisphere . With the Transcontinental Highway being bulldozed through the tropical jungle of the Amazon basin , those last , untapped virgin stands in the world are in danger of destruction as they become accessible . It will be impossible for a second growth to keep up with the demand . Today 's farming , printing , building , packaging , plastics , and chemical industries eat into the surviving and replanted reservoir of forests at a rate faster than they can regenerate . But trees are not only a source of prime raw materials . They are the major converters of carbon dioxide IO2 CARPENTRY into breathable oxygen . For all these reasons wood will certainly become a treasured commodity once again , used discreetly as a craft material . This will also stimulate a revival of interest in its unique properties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one hundred years ago much of Europe , North America , Asia , and Africa was covered with dense forests . They were decimated by a wasteful burning of wood to clear land for agriculture , for fuel , and for conversion into charcoal for iron smelting and other industrial processes , and by pulping to supply the paper making ( see 11 . A ) and chemical industries . Wood was also the prime raw material used for furniture and common household articles . But since the American Civil War , " anything which hitherto had been made of wood was quickly duplicated and mass-produced in iron . " 46 And with this decline of wood as a precious raw material , the craftsmen who were skilled in transforming it for utilitarian and esthetic purposes became scarce . As a first introduction to carpentry , cardboard ? corrugated and chip ? and the various wall and composition boards are as useful as wood and sometimes more so . They are softer and easier to saw , joint , and work and they are usually less expensive . Therefore many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials other than wood on which carpentry tools can he used ( see II . 1 and J ) . 103 a . Carpentry Tools Today 's production and hobby carpentry involves the use of a profusion of power tools . But the judgment demanded for working in wood requires training in and use of simple hand tools , not only as a learning process for young people but also as preparation for an eventual use of machinery . Sawing , hammering , drilling , jointing , and other operations in woodworking require a familiarity with the characteristics of the raw material that can only be gained from working with hand tools . The miniature power tools often given to children as toys make it impossible for them to acquire a hand-felt knowledge of the material or the coordination and inventiveness that lead to a creative exploration of the unique properties of wood . " For , like the nails on a beast 's paw , the old tools were so much an extension of a man 's hand or an added appendage to his arm , that the resulting workmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to carry something of himself into the work . " 45 There 's a knack to driving a nail with a hammer that , if it becomes second nature , frees a child or young person so that he or she can concen-I04 CARPENTRY trate on the creative aspects of crafts . There are efficient ways of using a screwdriver , a hand drill , or a saw , setting up work , preparing jigs , or making a mortise , so that the process of creation can take precedence over production ( see I.e ) . These operations require experience that , cumulatively , lays the foundation on which more advanced skills can be built . But it 's not enough to give a child a hand tool kit or a workbench . He needs experiences and an outlook that make it possible for him to use carpentry tools imaginatively and with a purpose . He needs to be given raw materials on which to exercise tools , skills , and his own ideas . He needs guidance to enable him to understand that the purpose of the exer-cise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most children 's tool kits are shoddily made . They are intended fo make-believe rather than craft . They foster the delusion that ownership of a profusion of tools makes the craftsman . Hardly any of these kits include materials on which the tools can be used . None offer a program of developmental craft education that encourages the expansion of the child 's abilities . Many include sharp and dangerous tools , like an awl that are inappropriate and useless for the age groups to which they are given . It is important to give a child only one or two tools at a time , togethe with materials on which they can be used . They should be presented so that he or she is encouraged to explore them and be inventive . The child needs a properly illuminated table at which he can work comfortably and safely . He also needs to be shown basic craft disciplines and have some of the possible effects of violating them explained to him . Some parents and teachers are afraid to give carpentry tools to young children . They worry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or create havoc among siblings or furniture . Yet children to whom tools and materials are properly introduced , who are fired with enthusiasm fo creating self-originated ideas and objects , and who are given guidance , are not likely to misuse tools . Only those who are ill equipped and unprepared and have no satisfying craft goals in view tend to scratch away destructively at table legs with toy saws . Besides , as pointed ou earlier , anything is dangerous in the hands of an undisciplined or inex-perienced child . Even an infant 's mallet can do great damage if it is given to a child who has no pounding bench on which to use it . Such a I05 child is naturally inclined to try out his tool on mother 's crockery to see what happens . Tools for children are best bought from educational , jeweler 's , or art supply stores and hardware shops , rather than in toy shops . Most profes-sional tools come in a variety of sizes and weights , some sufficiently small and light that they fit the hands of children mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the handle has been shortened , makes an excellent child 's carpentry hammer . Model mak-ers ' and jewelers ' coping saws and jigsaws fit the hands of any five-year-old . A regular compass , keyhole , wallboard , or dovetail saw or a back saw is far more useful and workable than the miniature cross-cut saws usually found in children 's toy tool chests . And they are much less dangerous . The least expensive , lightweight carpenter 's hand drill is preferable to its shoddy toy counterpart and is no more expensive . Real tools inspire a respect for craft and a sense of purpose and responsibility in children . If tools are presented to children one at a time , the child will eventually posers a complete tool kit that is permanently valuable . He 'll know how and when to use each tool and how to care for it . The next tool can be provided when the child is ready for it and when he knows how to use all other previously supplied ones effectively . A clear division is made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter are safe even for pre-school children unless they are grossly misused . " Sharp " tools require considerable experience , coordination , and self-discipline . Few children below the age of eleven or io6 CARPENTRY twelve are sufficiently mature to use such sharp tools safely unless they have had ample experience with first tools in carpentry and other craft since early childhood , and unless they work under close supervision . b . When to Provide Tools Give the child a new tool only when he can hold it properly . If the smallest or lightest weight professional tool is too heavy or difficult to hold and guide , then the child should not be expected to work with it . The same principle applies to the material . A child mature enough to handle a coping saw may not have the strength and endurance to saw through ' /s " plywood . Give him balsa , wallboard , or soft carboard instead . The chronology in which tools are given is important . Before a child can learn how to use a hand drill , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does not slip when drilled , and how to place scrap lumber under it so that the bottom edges of the holes do n't fray and splinter and the table surface is not damaged . The forethought , planning , and care the child learns will become second nature , not only in the operations detailed in this chapter but also in everyday life and work at home and in school . 1 07 c . Spontaneity and Planning The more advanced forms of carpentry , like all other craft , require planning , measurement , marking , and transfer of designs for parts that are to be sawed , drilled , or jointed . Before a child can be ready for such work he needs ample time and experience with tools and materials that permit spontaneous experimentation . Do n't teach a child how to mark or saw along a straight line , or how to joint or make objects that require numerical or geometric measurement , until he has experienced spontaneous craft . The meaning and purpose of numbers , measures , weights , and proportions can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills , and desire to apply them to creative ends . Carpentry creates the need for an application of measuring and other mathematical skills , and it demonstrates their practical uses . d . Work Spaces Carpentry involves work that can ruin household or school furniture . It is therefore important to provide proper and safe working spaces and surfaces . Most commercially made children 's worktables and benches ( other than those made for school use ) are inadequate , expensive , and last for only a short time . They also take up an excessive amount of space . As an alternative to the trestle worktable ( see I.j ) that is adjustable as the child grows , the table top workbench shown here can be made in any home or school workshop . It can be stored in a closet or on a shelf or stacked in the classroom when not in use . It can be clamped to any child- or adult-size table top to serve wood , metal , leather , and other craft activities . Io8 CARPENTRY e . Safety Carpentry requires some special precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they apply . ( See also I.k , 86 , and 87 . ) Teach the child to be especially conscious of the hand and fingers that hold the material while wood is sawed , drilled , gouged , or chiseled , or a nail driven . Insist that a vise or clamp hold the material to the table whenever possible , instead of holding it in hand . Whenever the child uses sharp tools , chisels , knives , gouges , or even a screwdriver , the hand resting on or holding the material should always be well away from , behind , and out of the way of the stroke of the tool ( see 131 ) . B. FIRST PROJECTS 105 . Play Preparation Table These toys are essential preparation for later craft skills and interests . Piling building blocks on top of one another and fitting pegs to matching holes are not only exercises in coordination ; they stimulate understanding of which shapes fit and which do n't , and of relative sizes . I have detailed elsewhere the most effective methods for introducing wooden blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide them.3 Large plastic or wooden nuts and bolts and sanded wooden slats with holes drilled through them so that they can be bolted together , with a large wooden or small metal wrench to tighten the bolts , and similar toys prepare the child for insights and skills he will need for carpentry as for other craft and learning . A pounding bench is the most useful first tool kit for children one and a half to three years old . Remove all tools but the mallet at the start . Teach the child to hold it near the end of the handle and not near the head , as young children are wont to do . Suggest that he or she keep eyes fixed on the peg to be hammered and the other hand well out of harm 's way . 109 Tack Hammering Table At nursery school or kindergarten age a child who has enjoyed the preparatory experiences detailed above ( see 105 ) should possess suf ficient coordination to use a small hammer to drive tacks into planks . Show him how to start the tack by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work table . He can hammer designs with colored tacks . Nailing Table Do not give young children small-headed brads or common or finishing nails to hammer . They are difficult to strike . Roofing nails have extra-large heads and are therefore especially useful at early ages . Set the child up at his or her worktable or workbench ( see I. j and III . A.d ) or , if the work is to be done at a regular table , make sure that a wooden workboard is provided . Then show the child how to nail lath and tongue depressors to scrap lumber shapes . Demonstrate how a sin gle nail only hinges the lath to the wood ; a second and third nail will hold it firmly . Teach the child to check the length of the nail against the depth of the layers of wood he plans to join before nailing them together so that the nail ends do not protrude beyond the material ( see diag. 107. a . ) . IIO CARPENTRY You may have to show the child repeatedly how the nail must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held between fingers only until the point has penetrated the wood and the nail can stand up by itself ; and how the hammer should be held ( see diag. 107. b ) . Point out that the hammer 's head will strike the nail squarely if he keeps his eyes fixed on the nail 's head . Teach him how to tap the nail rather than hit it hard . Then let him work on his own and discover the different ways of nailing pieces of wood to each other . 108 . The Nail Set Table Once the child is adept at nailing with large-headed roofing nails and tacks , he can be given common nails of various lengths . A nail set can now be added to his tool kit . It will enable him to drive common nailheads slightly below the surface of the wood for a better and safer finish . 109 . Sanding Table Cut the sheets of sandpaper with scissors so that they fit round the wooden blocks . Tape or staple one sheet of each grade of sandpaper to III the blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then let the child sand scrap lumber until it is splinter-free and smooth , using the coarser paper first and then the finer one to obtain a good finish . The child must be shown how to sand with the grain of the wood . This is a good opportunity to point out the different grains of various woods and the difference between the texture and appearance of end grain and that running lengthwise on the board . Show the child how the wood is marred when sanded against the grain . Carpenters generally do not sand wood until the work is finished . However , it is important to safeguard young children from splinters and rough edges and surfaces . An inventory of sanded scrap lumber is useful for a great number of future carpentry projects . 110 . Gluing ( See 9 ? 26 for tools and materials . ) Professional carpenters prefer hot glues , resins , and synthetics for permanently bonding wood . But for use by children and young people most of the recommended pastes and adhesives serve wood as well as paper , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber cement do not bond wood effectively . Commercially available casein glues , mucilage , and acrylics are recommended for children 's carpentry projects . Show the child how to apply a minimum of adhesive and yet cover one or both surfaces with an even coating of glue . Have him wipe away excess glue around joints with a damp cloth before the glue begins to set . Later he can use clamps to hold pieces of wood together while the glue dries ( see 112 ) . The child must learn to be patient and not to disturb glued joints and surfaces until the adhesive has cured completely . I I 2 CARPENTRY 111 . Collages and Assemblages Table The child can nail different shapes of wood on top of and next to one another onto the board , or make an open or partially enclosed hollow framework ( see diag . I l l ) , or combine both techniques . Such construc tions can be accessorized with natural and processed found materials ( see XIV ) . When completed , they can be painted ( see III.G and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 , and 97 . ) C. EARLY YEARS CARPENTRY 112 . Clamping Table Once a child enjoys woodworking , clamping will expedite gluing and other operations . He can then attempt more ambitious projects . The model maker 's or wood hand-screw clamps are optional , but they are essential for advanced carpentry. 113 It does n't matter if the wood is marred or scratched during a child 's early carpentry efforts . Nevertheless it is important to instill care and good work habits as early as possible . Teach the child to keep a scrap of wood or lath between the jaws of any metal clamp he may use and the outside surfaces of the wood that is held . When the wood is protected in this manner , C-clamps can be useful for nailing and gluing . The corner clamps enable the child to join wooden pieces at perfect right angles ( see 120 ) . The model maker 's and wood hand-screw clamps are designed for more delicate work . 113 . The Vise Table Once a child understands the purpose of clamps , he 'll benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at any hardware store and can be attached to a trestle table ( see I.j ) , table top workbench ( see III.A.d ) , or any other worktable . A combination of clamps and vise is the equivalent of several extra pairs of hands . II4 CARPENTRY A light duty , clamp-on metal vise is less desirable for carpentry , though it is less expensive than a carpenter 's vise . If such a metal jaw vise is used for woodworking , be sure to instruct the child in the cautions detailed earlier ( see 112 ) so as not to damage wood surfaces . 114 . The Coping Saw or Jigsaw Table The diagram shows how the coping saw workbench attachment can be made if none is available in local hardware or craft shops . Without it a child will find it difficult to use a coping saw effectively . The project detailed below demonstrates how a young child can use a new tool inventively if the materials are presented properly . Let him or her draw a picture or design onto the paper . Make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawing to the cardboard and trim off any excess paper . Clamp the workbench attachment to the table . Insert a spiral saw blade into the jaws of the coping saw . A child I15 can not cut himself with such a blade while working with it . Show him how to hold the saw by the handle after he is seated before the table . Saw cuts should be made inside the V-shaped notch of the workbench attachment . Then suggest that the child cut the picture into as many small pieces as he chooses . He 'll make his own jigsaw puzzle . Demonstrate how to start the first cut ( and all future cuts ) by moving the saw blade up and down gently against the edge of the material , keeping the blade as perpendicular as possible . Any five- or six-year-old can make such a puzzle without difficulty at one or more work sessions . He can put the cut-apart pieces of his puzzle into an envelope as a gift . Once he becomes proficient in the use of the coping saw , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diag. 114. c ) and other shapes . Note : For other work with a coping saw involving interior cuts , it is necessary to drill a hole inside the area to be cut away ( see 116 ) , large enough so that the coping saw blade can be inserted through it before it is fitted to the saw itself . Then attach the blade to the saw handle and cut away the interior portion . If any blade other than a spiral blade is used , be sure that the teeth of the blade face down when inserted into the coping saw . I16 CARPENTRY 115 . Inlay Table Paste different-colored flint paper onto each cardboard and trim off the excess around the edges . Then , using rubber cement , spot-glue the paper side of one board to the bottom side of the other so that they fit perfectly . Apply the rubber cement wet ( see 21 ) so that the boards can be separated easily later . Now let the child cut into the glued-together boards with his saw as before ( see 114 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . When both boards have been sawed into as many pieces as desired , separate the two layers wherever they remain glued together and clean off the rubber cement with a pick-up eraser ( see 20 ) . Two identical shapes , each of a different color , are now available for each cutoff . The child can use them to make two different inlay puzzles , each a different combination of snug-fitting shapes of the two colors ( see diag. 115 ) . More complex and interesting inlays can be made , using more than two sheets of different-colored paper mounted to cardboard . After rubber cementing them together and cutting them apart as before , each inlay can be reconstructed and pasted permanently to balsa , shirt board , or other cardboard . 116 . Drilling Table Let the child sand the wood to be drilled until it is splinter-free and smooth . Then show him or her how to clamp it into the vise for horizontal drilling of the surface ( see diag. 116. a ) or vertical drilling of the edge ( see diag. 116. b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertical drilling . Place the larger piece of scrap wood behind or underneath the wood to be drilled . It will assure a clean hole and it protects the table or other surface from being penetrated by the drill bit . Insert the 1/4 " bit into the chuck of the drill and tighten it firmly . Then show the child how to mark a small cross on the wood , using try square and pencil , wherever he wishes to drill a hole . Demonstrate how the point of the bit must be placed against the center of this cross , and how to turn the handle of the drill to keep it at a right angle to the wood and assure a clean , perpendicular hole . I18 CARPENTRY After the drill has penetrated all the way through the first layer of wood , give it a couple of extra turns to assure total penetration and a clean hole . Remove the wood from vise or clamp and let the child inspect it . Then allow him to drill as many holes as he wishes . When he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or secure it to the edge of the table with a clamp ( see diag. 116. c ) . Let the child saw off several short lengths with his coping saw . He can then drive these dowels into the holes he drilled into the wood , using his mallet . Due to variations in diameter and possible swelling of the wood , he may have to sand the dowels before they fit the holes . Once the child has learned these operations , he can drill different scraps of wood and lath and peg them together to build , form , and construct . 117 . The Wrench Table Once the child has learned to drill holes into the wood and lath , he can join them with nuts and bolts . Strips of lath , drilled and bolted to others and to pieces of scrap lumber , will familiarize him with levers . Empty thread spools bolted to drilled lumber enable him to invent moving designs , mechanisms , and toys . 118 . The Screwdriver Table There is no point in giving a child a screwdriver until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are predrilled slightly smaller than the diameter of the shank of the screws , a screwdriver is extremely hazardous ? far more so than many sharp tools ? and difficult to use . Unlike nails , screws should never be held in hand while a screwdriver is used ; the tool can slip and inflict a deep and painful wound . It is therefore important to teach the child to drill the required hole with an appropriate bit , almost as deep as the screw is long . Insert the pointed end of the screw into the hole and turn it hand-tight before using the screwdriver . Clamp two pieces of lumber , one quarter again as thick , when clamped , as the screws are long , to the table or into the vise , together with the 3/4 " - thick backing board . Select a bit slightly smaller in diameter than the screw to be used . Insert it into the chuck of the drill and drill a hole through the two pieces of wood that are to be joined , no deeper than three quarteers of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the screw length against the thickness of the two pieces of wood to assure that the sharp point of the screw will not penetrate the far side after it is screwed into the wood ( see diag. 118 ) . Then screw the two pieces of wood together . Once the child has observed and understood these various operations , he needs ample opportunity to practice on his own . 119 . Countersink Table Countersink The top of the shank of any screw is slightly larger than the threaded part . Hence the head is likely to protrude above the surface of the wood I20 CARPENTRY unless it is forced into it . Show the child how to insert the countersink into the chuck of the hand drill to enlarge the hole he first drilled into the wood , so that the screw , once fully driven into the wood with the screwdriver , lies flush with the surface of the wood or slightly below it . 120 . Miter Box and Back Saw Table Clamp the miter box to the table edge firmly . Place the pine board inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts that can be made by placing the saw into the different slots cut into the miter box . Show the child how 90 ? and 45 ? cut pieces can be joined for gluing , nailing , and screwing . Corner clamps are useful for demonstrating some of the possible joints , ( see III.E ) , as well as for holding the cut lumber in place for jointing . It is important that the child learn how to hold the saw properly from the very start , using the " pistol grip " with index finger extended as a guide ( see 129 ) . This assures the most effective control of any hand saw . The miter box is the best introduction to sawing since it teaches the importance of maintaining the proper angle of the saw to achieve the desired cut . Once the child understands these operations and requirements , he is I2I ready to saw . Later he can learn to mark the lines , using try square and triangle , along which he decides to cut ( see III.D ) . He must then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot . Starting the cut without fraying the wood is a matter of practice and experience . Start at one edge of the wood with short , quick strokes of the saw blade until the teeth make a small notch within which they remain . Then , using longer , even strokes of the saw , the wood can be cut all the way through . When the child nears the end of his cut , he must shorten the strokes of the saw once more so that the further edges of the board do not splinter at the finish . If the saw blade binds , either the saw is not held perpendicular to the cut already made , or it may require a little soap applied to the teeth . If the ease of sawing does not improve , the teeth of the saw may require setting and sharpening . Any hardware store will have this done at nominal cost . Keep the saw blade covered with a thin film of oil while it is not in use . D. PLANNING AND MEASUREMENT WITHOUT NUMBERS Identical rudiments apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see XII ) . Some of the tools used in carpentry make it possible for young people to plan and duplicate parts without using numerical measurements . Table Making a simple six-sided box usually requires measurements to achieve duplicate identical sides and matching top and bottom , even if all the boards are square . An allowance must be made for the thickness of the wood in calculating the dimensions , and simple fractions are required for some of these measurements . But such a box can also be made by a child who is not yet familiar with these mathematical operations . I22 CARPENTRY Table The child marks off a short length of the 3 " - wide lumber . He then places it inside his miter box and cuts along this mark ( see 120 ) . He places the short , sawed-off piece on top of another , longer piece of 3 " lumber , with ends lined up , and runs a sharp pencil point along the other end of the top piece , marking another of the same size onto the bottom one ( see diag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will have two identical pieces for opposite sides of the box . When the same operation is repeated a second time , the four pieces required for the frame of the box will be complete . He can glue , nail , or screw these sides together , using corner clamps ( see 112 ) . This frame can then be traced onto the 12 " plywood to form the bottom and lid of the box . After being cut with a saw , they can be glued , nailed , screwed , or hinged to the frame . Use the marking gauge to indicate the line on the top and bottom pieces along which nails or screws are to be driven ( see 122 ) . The box will be reasonably square and a satisfying piece of work . This tool is of value only if at least one side of the wood is perfectly straight . For younger children all sides of the lumber should he trimmed square before it is given to them . 123 122 . The Marking Gauge This tool is especially useful at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make numerical measurements with precision . He can set it to any desired width and duplicate this measurement elsewhere . For example , he can set the gauge to approximately half the width of the edge of a piece of lumber and mark this distance on the top side of any other wood to which it is to be nailed or screwed . Nails or screws driven along such a line , unless they are driven crooked , are unlikely to protrude through the outside surface of the wood beneath . 123 . Templates Templates are useful in any craft , especially at an age when the child can not measure with accuracy or where organic shapes defy measurement ( see 68 ) . Once a child knows how to make templates , he can I24 CARPENTRY duplicate or transfer any shape he wishes . Insist that the child invent his own templates . Do n't furnish him or her with readymade plans or printed and die-cut templates that he merely copies . Be sure to point out that when a template is used , a pencil line drawn around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interior shape a slightly smaller ) duplicate of the original . In sawing or otherwise cutting out such a shape an allowance must be made for the difference by cutting either slightly inside or outside the marked line , as appropriate , or redrawing it beforehand ( see diag. 123 ) . 124 . Using Tools to Make Tools Braces , struts , temporary supports for pieces that are to be jointed , strips of wood fastened to the workbench to hold a board that is being worked on , and other temporary aids devised by the young craftsman are a sign of mature craftsmanship . Encourage the invention of tools that aid or speed the work . For example , a strip of ? " x 1 " x 12 " wood into which holes , small enough to hold a pencil snugly , are drilled at intervals , and a nail driven through one end , can be turned into a useful beam compass ( see diag. 124 ) . E. JOINTING Use of the miter box ( see 120 ) and corner clamps ( see 112 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more complex and durable joints will enable him to use his craft with greater versatility . The following are six useful jointing methods ( see 125 ? 127 ) that do not require the use of chisels. 125 125 . Bracing Wooden strips and right angle and other braces can be glued , nailed , or screwed to a wooden base to provide temporary or permanent support for other pieces that are attached to them and each other ( see 93 and 95 ) . 126 . Peg Jointing Carpenters and shipwrights of former times preferred to peg wood instead of nailing , screwing , or bolting , long after the invention of metal fasteners . Wood tends to dry away from nails , screws , and bolts ; and the metal rusts . But wooden pegs swell and shrink at the same rate as the wood they hold together . Hence pegged wood lasts longer . Boards can be pegged edge to edge ( see diag. 126. a. ) , edge to side ( see diag. 126. b ) , or side to side ( see diag. 126. c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the edges of both pieces or of one of the pieces to be jointed , and marking it on the two edges or on one edge and one side ( see 403 ) . Then both pieces must be clamped together as shown so that the crossed lines that indicate where holes are to be drilled match precisely ( see 65 ) . Drill a hole at each mark ( see 116 ) . Drill no deeper than to three quarters of the thickness of the board ( see diag. 126. d ) . Using a dowel of the same diameter as the drill bit , saw pegs a shade shorter than the I26 CARPENTRY combined depth of each matching set of holes in both boards . Tap together both boards , with pegs inserted , before gluing to assure a proper fit . Take the boards apart again and glue all the pegs into the holes drilled in one of the boards . Then cover the protruding pegs and the spaces between them with paste or glue . Insert the pegs glued to one board in the matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mallet and with a damp rag wipe away any excess glue that seeps out of the joints . Clamp the boards firmly until the glue has set ( see 65 ) . 127 . Rabbet , Half Lap , End Lap and Butt Joints The flush rabbet joint requires careful measuring and marking of half the thickness and width of the lumber on one end of one of the pieces of wood to be jointed ( see diag. 127. a ) . Half lap ( see diag. 127. b. ) and end lap ( see diag. 127. c ) joints must be marked on both boards , as I27 shown , before sawing . For butt jointing , saw and sand joints and fit them carefully square before securing them with glue , nails , or screws ( see diag. 127. d. ) . 128 . Other Joints The following are some other common wood joints ; these do , however , require the use of a chisel ( see diags. 128 and 131 ) . Some can be built up out of wood or cardboard , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joints do not have much strength ( see 89 ) . I28 CARPENTRY // The tools described in this section are very sharp . They require careful use under supervision and periodic honing ( see 135 ) . These tools are not recommended for younger age groups or inexperienced young people . A child above the age of eleven or twelve may be able to use them under supervision , provided he is given ample preparatory experience . 129 . Crosscut Saw and Ripsaw Table The crosscut saw is designed to cut across the grain of the wood ; the ripsaw , with the grain ( see diag. 129. a ) . Each has a different number , set , and shape of sawteeth , suited to the job for which they are intended . These are large and heavy carpenter 's tools that are more difficult to guide than those described earlier for use by younger and less experi- // enced young people . For this reason a miter box , though not usually used by carpenters with these saws , is especially recommended for novices . If a miter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood is too large , make sure that the boards to be sawed are firmly clamped down or held in a vise before sawing starts . The pistol grip ( see diag. 129. b ) is the proper way to guide these saws. 130 . The Plane Table A block or trimming plane is best to teach young carpenters how to shave warped , uneven lumber ; to trim wood too thick to fit ; or to round edges . Nail a strip of 1 " x 2 " lumber to the worktable against which to brace the wood for planing ( see diag. 130 ) . Demonstrate how and why the wood must always be planed with the grain , and how to adjust the blade setting at the knurled knob attached to the handle of the plane . 131 Check the depth of the cut by inspecting the knife edge on the bottom of the plane and try it out on scrap lumber . A thin , level , even sliver , and no more , should be removed with each pass of the plane . Too deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crease the surface so that it requires endless planing and sanding before it is smooth and level again . 131 . The Chisel Table Chisels are dangerous . They require great care and concentration . Show the young carpenter how easily a chisel can slip or jump if the bite is too shallow or too deep . Insist that the chisel always be worked away from the user ( see diag. 131. a ) and that the wood be firmly clamped before the work begins . The suggested 2 " x 4 " block is useful for practice . Working with the grain is essential except when mortising a joint ( see 128 ) . To do the latter , the chisel must be held with the flat side facing away from the edge of the mortise ( see diag. 131. b ) . Then tap the top of the chisel handle gently with the mallet and carve away slivers until the knife edge reaches the saw cut and the wedge can be severed . Once a young carpenter is sufficiently experienced to use a chisel safely , he will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Awl Of all the carpenter 's tools , this is the most hazardous , and yet it is one that is included in most toy tool kits . It is also relatively useless except to start a nail hole or one for a drill bit , though it is not essential for either operation . Keep the point of the awl firmly embedded in a wood block or a kneaded eraser except when in use . Keep it out of reach of young children . 133 . Wood Burning This is not recommended for any age group . It is hazardous and offers few opportunities for creative work . 134 . Whittling and Wood Carving Table These are hazardous activities that require extreme care and constant adult supervision . Make sure that all tools are finely sharpened and honed , rust-free , and firmly implanted in their handles . The wood block should always be held in a vise or , if this can not be done , clamped to the worktable or held in hand behind the tool , away from the direction in which it is worked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is best for beginners to design the shape to be carved in advance and draw it onto the wood , rather than carving spontaneously . Draw a silhouette of the top view onto both the top and the bottom surface of the wood block ; draw side view silhouettes onto each side surface ( see diag. 134. a ) . Then , with the wood firmly held in the vise , carve the contours in top and bottom with gouges and mallet . Tap the end of the gouge handle with the mallet and remove slivers rather than chunks of wood . When the top and bottom silhouettes are carved roughly , cover them with thick layers of cloth so as not to mar the wood when these sides are 133 locked into the vise or clamped to the table . Carve the other sides ; then add detail all around . Additional shaping can be done with rasps , files , and sandpaper ( see diag. 134. b ) . 135 . Care and Sharpening of Tools Table Young and relatively inexperienced tool users can not be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of tools become too dull to be restored through honing , they should be taken to a knife sharpener . But any young person old enough to use knife , plane , chisel , and gouge should be able to hone them . To sharpen a plane or chisel , place a few drops of oil on the stone and hold the beveled edge of the tool against the stone , at a steeper angle than the bevel ( see diag. 135. a ) . Move the blade back and forth steadily , making sure that the same angle is maintained between blade and // stone . Do not hold the blade against the stone so that the whole beveled area touches it . The bevel itself can only be restored on a grinding wheel . When a sharp cutting edge has been obtained , turn the blade over and place it flat on the stone ( see diag. 135. b ) to remove burrs , moving it back and forth on its side . Finally , pass both sides of the blade back and forth over a leather strop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( keep it oiled at all times ) . The same technique applies to knife blades , though these have no " flat " sides . Keep the dull edge of the blade raised slightly off the stone ( see diag. 135. c ) and hone each side in turn . Gouges that have round cutting edges require a flat stone for honing , but the burrs are removed on a rounded stone after honing ( see diag. 135. d ) . // After a construction or an object has been made , the young carpenter may choose to preserve the wood ? paint , varnish , shellac , or stain it . Younger age groups will find it sufficiently satisfying to paint wood with poster colors ( see 206 ) . If they wish , they can protect the painted surfaces with water glass ( see 42 ) , transparent glue ( see 16 ) , or a light coat of varnish or shellac . Bear in mind that the last two are volatile and toxic , and constitute a serious fire hazard . They also ruin paint brushes unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then washed in warm water and soap ( see 141 and 227 ) . 136 . Wood Filler Table Any indentation , crack , or scar on the surface of the wood should be filled with wood filler before painting , staining , or varnishing . Plastic wood is commercially available . It can be sanded smooth like the wood , but when stained or given a natural finish it will not match the wood around it . For a matching filler it is necessary to make a mixture using sawdust collected from the same wood being repaired . Add a few drops of clear varnish and paste . Fill the indentation in the wood , let it dry thoroughly , and then sand . 137 . Sanding and Sealing Wood Table Wood should be sanded and sealed before it is painted , or most of the paint will sink in , giving it an uneven coating . Sealing compounds for wood are best bought in hardware and paint stores . The wood should be thoroughly sanded , first using a coarse paper and then finer grades , always with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . For a high finish it should then be polished with fine steel wool . Two light // coats of sealer , each evenly applied with a brush , will close the pores of the wood . The second coat is applied only after the first has dried completely . Wipe away any excess with a cloth or rag after each application . After the final coat has dried , rub it down gently with steel wool once more . 138 . Painting the Wood The variety of oil-base and synthetic paints , enamels , and other finishes is so great that it would be futile to try to list and describe them . Dress the child in old and protective clothing . ( See I.k and 227 for essential general safety precautions . ) Cover table and floor space around the work area with several layers of newspaper to protect them from spills . Be sure to have an ample supply of the appropriate thinner for cleaning hands and brushes ( see 141 ) , for thinning the paint or other finishing material , and to remove stains from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be painted in a single color , it is best to do so after final assembly of all parts . However , if small sections or parts are to be painted in several different colors or shades , it is best to paint them before assembly , provided no edges that are to be glued are covered with paint . Painted surfaces give poor adhesion . 139 . Natural Wood Finish Table Mix all three liquid ingredients in equal proportion . Keep in a closed jar and shake well before using . After the wood has been filled and sanded ( see 136 and 137 ) but not sealed , apply this mixture to the surface with a cloth ; wipe off any excess . Repeat this process two or three times , rubbing with steel wool after each application has dried , until the wood is thoroughly penetrated and the pores are sealed . This provides a matte finish that is resistant to water , alcohol , and other stains. 140 . Staining Table Fill in blemishes and sand as before ( see 136 and 137 ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of linseed oil and turpentine in equal proportions . Wipe off any excess with the cloth . When this coating has dried completely , apply the desired stain , which can be bought in any hardware or paint store . Wipe off any excess with a cloth before the stain dries . Repeat the staining after each successive coating until the desired color emerges . 141 . Brushes Use bristle brushes , ? " wide or wider , for painting wood , depending on the size of the object or the delicacy of the design . Use long-haired , narrow brushes for stripes , and round ones for painting detail . Instruct the young craftsman never to leave paint-filled brushes lying about but to rinse them at once after use , in the appropriate solvent . Brushes on which paint has dried are difficult to restore , and may be totally ruined . Wipe the brush on newspaper or rags and rinse it in thinner poured into a jar . Then wash it in mild soap and warm water . Brushes should never be stored standing on their hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a jar , or , preferably , hang them by the handle so that none of the hair touches any surface . If paint has dried on a brush , it should be hung in solvent . Make a brush holder out of wire that allows the brush to soak without its hair touching the bottom or sides of the jar ( see diag. 141 ) . // H. Power Tools Table Any of these , but not necessarily all , are useful to those young people who have mastered all the foregoing hand-tool skills , and who are capable , trustworthy , and deeply involved in work that requires specialized tools . They should have good reasons and creative uses for these tools before acquiring them . Since this book has a scope covering primarily hand tools and younger age groups , I suggest manufacturers ' handbooks and manuals as the best sources for instructions on how to operate , use , and care for these power tools . Wire and Metal Craft . . . This is an art Which does mend nature ? change it rather : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BACKGROUND The ability to mine , smelt , and work metal is a sign of civilization . It is one of the divisions , arbitrary though it may seem , between primitive and advanced societies . In early cultures that discovered the material and the means to refine and work it , the tribal smith or metal craftsman was a man set apart from the rest . His secrets were sanctified by ritual and custom . His strength was legendary . Magic powers were attributed to him , supposedly transmitted by a god , like Vulcan . Methods of refining metals , hardening them , combining them to make alloys , and casting and forging them were passed from father to son , as were the paths to the secret places where they could be found . The metal smiths of Benin in Africa , who wrought magnificent bronzes , the artisans of ancient China , Mesopotamia , Greece , Rome , and South America , were I40 WIRE AND METAL CRAFT versed in metal craft even while the people of central and northern Europe and those east and west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possibilities of these materials . North American Indians were still in the Stone Age at the time of the arrival of Europeans , despite rich mineral deposits close to the surface on their continent . Yet today there is hardly any tribe or group of human beings , no matter how isolated , that does not possess some idea of how to work and use metals ? if only those obtained from discarded tin cans or crashed airplane fuselages . Some of the common metals we take for granted , like aluminum , were discovered less than two hundred years ago . The French emperor Napoleon treasured aluminum more than gold and ordered a special set of tableware to be cast from this metal for his court . But like all limited resources of this planet , many metals will soon become scarce once again at the present rate of wasteful consumption . Even scrap metals , many of them essential in the smelting of alloys , are now in short supply . Huge quantities of discarded metal are heaped daily onto rubbish dumps to rust and be irretrievably dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools have evolved as a result of the experience of generations of craftsmen . Hardly any are required for early age children 's metalwork . Even more advanced students need only a few tools and materials that are inexpensive or free . As in carpentry , only one or two tools should be given at one time , as required for specific skills and projects . They are described below in a chronology that eventually provides young people with skills , incentives for invention , and the required basic equipment . Four metal products are of special interest and value to the young craftsman : Table Most principles of workmanship , processes , tools , and skills apply to all metals , whether tin , copper , brass , or iron . Precious metals like silver and gold are usually out of reach of young craftsmen , but they are worked very much like the rest . Aluminum does require special handling as it can not he soldered or otherwise jointed except by riveting . 141 Further , it ca n't be painted , but must be anodized . Galvanized sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be painted unless it is first dipped into an acid bath . Fabric and plastic covered wire allows even pre-schoolers to enjoy an introduction to this craft . Ample scrap and waste metals are available in and outside the home to provide older boys and girls with an inexhaustible supply without cost ? wire coat hangers and clean , empty tin cans , among others . Whole or cut-apart scrap and junked metal rods , tubes , nuts and bolts , discarded hardware , cog wheels , and broken watch , instrument , and other machine casings and parts are valuable for metal collages and assemblages , as well as for working parts of useful objects invented and made by young people . b . Work Spaces ( See I.j and III.A.d. ) c . Safety and Developmental Education The development of metal craft skills should begin at early ages . It may at first glance seem dangerous to introduce young children to metal // craft . Working with metal is actually less so than many other crafts that are regarded as safe . At earliest ages a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend and twist pipe cleaners or plastic covered wire . The sharp ends of such wire are easily covered with friction tape . Metal foil has edges that are not much sharper than those of paper . The young child must learn that they should be treated with care and that the foil can be folded or rolled to be perfectly safe . Metal and the required tools ca n't be worked by a child in whose hands they are unsafe ? he just does n't have the strength . Coat hanger wire , for example , is very difficult to form . Ordinary pliers require relatively large hands and a firm grip . Considerable muscle is needed to cut even through tin can sheet metal with metal shears . Any misused , abused , or forced tool or material is hazardous . Even a crayon can be a weapon if poked into a child 's eye . But a reasonably well-disciplined and cautious child can be taught to approach every tool and material with the required respect and foresight that will keep him safe . Only inexperienced children lack inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal involves safety problems . Soldering should never be attempted except by young people who have considerable experience in the craft , who can be depended on to be careful , and even then only under supervision . Any tool or material that is sharp or pointed or that requires or generates heat should never be used by any child , save with these provisions . B. FIRST PROJECTS 142 . Pipe Cleaners Table Modeling clay or modeling dough ( see 54 , 146 , 252 , and 277 ) As in all early age craft , the child needs ample opportunities to play with the materials . He also must have some of the possibilities demonstrated that might not occur to him unaided . Initial stress must be on spontaneous exploration ? never on " making something . " It is sufficiently difficult and intriguing to discover how to bend pipe cleaners 143 into curves and angles ; how to twist two or more strands together ; how to splice several lengths ; or how to insert one end of a pipe cleaner into a lump of clay to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon to a pipe cleaner ; using pipe cleaners as armatures for clay or modeling-compound objects , figures , and shapes ; stringing wood or clay beads onto pipe cleaners ; and pasting formed pipe cleaners to construction paper ( see diag. 142 ) . Any one or any combination of these activities affords the young child satisfying play exploration of the material . Do n't insist on realism or finished production . Admire the result no matter how clumsy it may seem . // Foil Projects Table Show the child how to hammer the edges of the clean , empty tin cans until all ragged , sharp metal edges where the tops were opened lie flat against the inside wall of the can . Demonstrate how to place the edge of the can against vise or anvil to tap it smooth , using the cold chisel where needed ( see diag. 144 ) . Then let the child decorate the outsides of the cans by gluing on colored paper strips , and streamers ( see 42 and // 145 . Covered Wire Construction Table Use the same techniques as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off required lengths of wire with the cutting pliers ; how to bend , 145 form , and twist the strands by hand and with pliers . Dowels , cardboard tubes , and other preformed shapes can be used as jigs ( see diag. 145 ) . As a precaution suggest that the child cover any wire that protrudes beyond the plastic covered ends with small pieces of friction tape . 146 . Making Armatures ( See 54 , 142 , 145 , and 277 for tools and materials . ) Any available wire that the child can work will do . For younger children pipe cleaners are best as armatures for modeling with clay and dough . Older and stronger children can use coat hanger wire ( see 149-152 ) . Sculptor 's armature wire is available from art supply stores . It is fairly large in diameter but is made of soft , flexible , lightweight alloy that is easily cut with pliers , hacksaw ( see 155 ) , or jigsaw ( see 156 ) . Provide a ? " to 3/4 " plywood base in which holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armature wire ends can be inserted and secured . Or nail , screw , and brace a dowel on the base to which the wire can be attached ( see diag. 146 ) . Once the wire armature is made , the child can cover it with clay or other modeling compound ( see VII ) . // 147 . The Metalworking Vise There are substantial differences between a woodworking vise and one used for metalwork . For young people 's craft purposes a metal vise can be adapted to woodwork ( see 113 ) , but not vice versa . For early years wire forming , a lightweight vise that can be clamped to any table is sufficient . For later , heavier work a vise , preferably one that swivels at least 180 ? , that can be bolted to a worktable is needed . The vise is a practical , essential tool for safety . Materials held in hand can slip and cause injury as they are worked . Sheet metal and wire can be bent safely by hand or with a mallet when they are firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vises include a small anvil on the side away from the jaws that can serve as a sheet metal and wire forming surface . Wire forming jigs ( see 151 ) and sheet metal forming stakes and forms ( see 162 and 163 ) can be locked into a heavy-duty vise . Table Demonstrate how to lock the pipe into the vise . Some metalworking vises have special jaws for pipe jointing . But even without this feature any small , light-duty , clamp-on vise will suffice , provided the pipe is not squeezed between the jaws . Show the child how to thread a pipe joint to the end of the pipe and attach the next length . Different constructions can be designed ( see diag. 148 ) . Once all the joints are handtight , they can be tightened further with the wrench. 147 Jointed pipe can be used for assemblages in combination with other materials , as armatures , and , attached to a garden hose , as sprinklers and fountains . D. WIREWORK Once the first metalworking skills , tools , and experiences have been acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wire forming , aside from being an art form in itself , has many practical applications , from electric circuit wiring and repair to jewelry making . No matter what the future holds , every contemporary young man or woman needs these skills in daily life ? in vocational employment and for home maintenance and repair , as well as in self-expressive art and craft . 149 . Wire Cutting Table Copper , steel , and brass wire is available in different thicknesses , varying from 26-gauge ( fine ) to 12-gauge ( heavy ) . It can be bought round , half round , and square . Ordinary pliers can be used to cut wire , but they are not very efficient , especially in the hands of young people . Even diagonal cutting pliers will not cut heavy wire , like a coat hanger . Wire that can not be cut easily with pliers must be locked into the vise so that the place where the // cut is to be made protrudes slightly from the jaws . A hacksaw ( see 155 ) , a jigsaw , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or triangular file ( see 152 ) should be used to cut heavy wire . 150 . Twisting and Jointing Table The same basic twists , bends , and joints apply as in 142 . Wire that is too difficult to form in hand should be locked into a vise and bent with a mallet or a ball peen hammer . To make a sharp angle , lock the wire into the vise just below the place where the bend is to be made and tap it with the hammer until the required angle is formed ( see diag. 150. a ) . Curve the wire around pipe or dowel for round and oval shapes . To twist two heavy wires into a double strand , bend each at the center into a 45 ? angle and lock both pieces into the vise side by side ( see diag. 150. b ) . Twist the protruding ends with ordinary pliers , starting near the jaws of the vise ( see diag. 150. c ) , or use a wrench if the wire is very heavy . With these techniques , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see 151 ) , wire can be bent and twisted into interesting shapes . Start with copper wire that can be easily formed in hand , twisted around itself or paper , cardboard , or wood armatures ( see 52 ? 54 and 146 ) . At later ages such wire sculpture can also be soldered ( see 166 ? 173 ) . 151 . Wire Forming Jig Table 149 Several different jigs are available . Most can be locked into a vise . The wire is then bent around one or a combination of the protruding shapes molded into the jig . Instructions furnished with the tool show how different forms are shaped . Wire hinges ( see 165 ) , chain links ( see 173 ) , shaped wire for jewelry , collages , assemblages , armatures , sculptures , and other objects can be fashioned with such a jig , using wire alone or in combination with metal pipe ( see 150 ) or other found metal shapes . 152 . Filing and Finishing Table Hacksaws ( see 155 ) , coping saws ( see 156 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diag. 152 ) leave sharp , ragged ends on wire and sheet metal when used for cutting . Ends and edges must be blunted and rounded before the metal is worked . Heavy wire can be locked into the vise to file ends smooth and finish them with emery cloth or paper . Wire or sheet metal can be cleaned , polished , or given texture or a high finish by rubbing with steel wool , emery paper , or buffing compound and cloth . // E. SHEET METAL Sheet metalwork requires considerable strength , planning , caution , selfdiscipline , and endurance . Provide empty , washed tin cans , opened at both ends , slit down one side , and with the rolled edges at both ends cut off ( see diag . IV . E ) . Children below the ages of ten or eleven usually lack the strength to cut tin with shears ( see 154 ) . And so they must either cut it with a hacksaw ( see 155 ) or a jigsaw ( see 156 ) , or this must be done for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 , 68 , and 153 ) the shapes they wish to cut before cutting the metal " blank . " The required techniques are detailed below . 153 . Planning the Work Sheet metal takes time to form . A spoiled part can cause tedious extra work that can be avoided with planning . Make a paper or cardboard model ( see 66-68 ) . After construction the model can be flattened and the shape transferred onto metal ( see 291 ) . Then the blank can be cut ( see 154-156 ) , ready to be formed by bending or hammering . Tape the sheet metal to the workbench and tape the paper template on top . Trace the outline of the template onto the metal , using a nail , divider point , or engraving needle ( see diag. 153 ) . To make a circle , 151 mark the place where its center is to be with a cross , and punch a small indentation into the metal at that point with a nail , deep enough to hold the point of a pair of dividers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribe the required circumference . If the design has been traced onto the metal with pencil and carbon paper , it is best to retrace the lines with a pointed instrument or etching needle ( see 313 and 314 ) since pencil or carbon rubs off metal . 154 . Cutting with Shears Table Metal shears are available in different sizes . All are difficult to work and hold by children and young people . If the young craftsman is strong enough to cut metal with shears , suggest that he clamp the metal sheet to the edge of the workbench so that the portion to be cut extends beyond it for easier cutting . Instruct him to file and emery-paper the edges of the shapes that he cuts out ( see 152 ) since they are likely to be sharp and ragged . Table Sheet metal , from tin can gauges to heavier ones , can be cut with a hacksaw , though it is impossible to cut any save the most gradual curves . Pipe , rod , and heavy wire similarly can be cut with this tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the teeth face away from the handle . File and emery-paper edges after cutting ( see 152 ) . 156 . Cutting with a Coping Saw or Jigsaw Table This is the most effective metal-cutting tool for young craftsmen . It requires special metal-cutting blades , available in jeweler 's supply stores . Make sure that the blade is fitted so that the teeth face the handle . The procedure ( including the need for a special V-shaped table // extension ) is the same as for using this tool on wood ( see 114 ) . Cutting metal , however , requires shorter strokes . Simple or intricate shapes can be cut into tin , copper , and brass . ( See 153 for suggestions concerning the transfer of designs from model or template to metal . ) File and emery-paper edges after cutting ( see 152 ) . 157 . Bending Table Scratch a line or lines into the metal where the blank is to be bent , using a nail , divider point , or engraving needle . Secure the blank in the vise so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel to it ( see diag. 157. a ) . Using the mallet , hammer the metal as close as possible to the line , gently and all along it , until the metal bends to the required angle . A bend in a long strip requires that it be moved back and forth in the vise , a little at a time , as the metal is hammered . Or such a strip can be clamped to the edge of the worktable top and then slowly hammered into shape ( see diag. 157. b ) . 153 Bends should be hammered gradually so that the metal does not split or crack . To make a small metal box or cube , bend each side partially in the vise until all surfaces are slightly angled . Finish the bends by hammering each side over a flat anvil with the mallet , or bending them by hand if the gauge of the metal allows , until they are at right angles to each other ( see diag. 157. c ) . 158 . Strip Metal Coiling and Forming Table Strips of sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , riveted ( see 164 ) , hinged ( see 165 ) , soldered ( see 166-170 ) , or chain linked ( see 173 ) to make armatures ; sculptures ; jewelry ; toys and other objects ; molds and dies for clay or modeling compounds ; and cookie cutters ( see diag. 158 ) . Bend the strips around found materials , metal forming dies , jigs , vise , or anvil ( see 150 , 151 , 157 , and 162 ) . Roll one edge for dies , molds , and cutters ; both edges for decorative uses ( see 159 ) . Rolling the Edges When making metal designs and objects with thin gauge sheet metal or strips , it is safest to roll the edges of the blank . Bend or hammer 1/s " to ? " of the metal edge until it lies flush with the flat metal surface . ( See also 157 and 158 . ) The metal edge should be filed and emeried before rolling . // 160 . Embossing Table Tape the blank to the plywood . The child can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal . If the blank warps during embossing , it can be straightened by hammering it gently with a rawhide mallet . The embossed design will appear raised on the other side of the blank . The indentations can be made more pronounced by embossing along the raised edges of the design on the " wrong " side . ( See also 35. ) 161 . Drilling Table Save for the special bits , the same techniques apply to metal as to wood . Scratch a small cross with nail or divider point where the hole is to be drilled . It is easier to start a drill if a small indentation is hammered with a nail at the center of the cross . Make sure that the indentation is no larger than the size of the hole that is to be drilled . It may take several turns of the drill before the bit bites into the metal . Drill slowly and without exerting great pressure on the bit . 162 . Hammering and Forming Table A circular , oval , or other flat blank can be formed by hammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ) , or over a metal stake fitted into the stake hole of an anvil , or over the anvil itself . Precast stakes can be ordered from art and craft supply shops . If no anvil is available , the stake can be locked into a large vise or sunk into a section of tree trunk . Forming stakes can also he carved out of blocks of wood ( see 134 ) . 155 If the hollow vessel or shape is to stand on a flat base , inscribe its circumference into the blank with a nail or divider point ( see diag. 162. b , and 153 ) . Then , whether or not a base is required , place the edge of the flat blank against the stake and tap it gently all around with the mallet . // Keep tapping in concentric circles , working toward the inscribed base line or center until the desired shape is reached ( see diag. 162. c ) . More or less intricate hollow shapes can be formed in this manner . Deliver gentle , even blows with the mallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working from the outer edge to the center as many times as required . Use the cross peen hammer to make a sharp ridge where the shaped side and the flat base of the vessel meet ( see diag. 162. d ) . Or , if no base has been inscribed , solder a curved strip of metal to the bottom to form the base ( see 166 , 169 , and 170 ) . Other shaped sheet metal forms can be made by working blanks placed into hollowed-out and carved wooden forms ( see diag. 162. a , and 134 ) . Interior cuts made with drill and jigsaw ( see 114 and 156 ) permit dimensional , textured , or relief shapes to be raised in the metal . Hammer the cut portion over an anvil with mallet or hammer until the desired shape is raised . ( See also 98. ) 157 163 . Planishing and Chasing Table Formed hollow shapes can be planished to give them texture and to refine contours . Place one hammer mark next to the last , starting from the base line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and work toward the outer edge . Repeat this procedure until the desired shape and texture are achieved . Due to the fact that the metal is thinned out by the hammering , the finished edges will change in contour and require trimming . Place the shape or vessel on its base and press it against a needle point fixed to a dowel or stand . Then slowly turn it to inscribe an even line around the top or outside edge ( see diag. 163. a ) . Use a metal shears or file to restore an even edge along the inscribed line and rub it with emery cloth . The completed work should be finished as in 152 . The texture of the hammer marks can be varied by spacing them closer or farther apart . Irregular shapes can be planished by using portions of ready-made forming anvils , found scrap metal shapes , pipes , or carved wooden forms ( see diag. 163. b , and 134 ) . // Designs can also be chased into formed sheet metal with chasing tools and hammer . The technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups to which this book is addressed . F. JOINING AND JOINTING METAL 164 . Riveting Table Mark the metal pieces to be joined where the rivets are to fit and drill holes at the appropriate places ( see diag. 164. a , and 161 ) . Tap a rivet head into the wood block to make an indentation that fits the rivet head ( see diag. 164. b ) . Insert the head of a rivet into this indentation and fit the shank of the rivet through both holes drilled in the metal ( see diag. 164. c ) . Tap the metal so that all pieces are snugly joined . Then , using the ball peen hammer and rivet die , shape the protruding end of the rivet ( see diag. 164. d ) . For a tight fit , tap the rivet until there is no play between it and the metal pieces . 159 165 . Hinging Table To form hinges out of the metal blanks to be joined , lay out the blanks as shown ( see diag. 165. a ) . Bend and curve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the ball peen hammer to form the hinge tubes ( see diag. 165. b ) . Then fit the blanks together and join them with wire inserted through the tubes ( see diag. 165. c ) . Bend the wire at each end of the hinge so that it can not work itself loose . Sheet metal blanks can also be hinged with chain links soldered to their edges or attached through holes drilled into the edges ( see 173 ) . 166 . Soldering Table Soldering is both hazardous and tricky . It is hazardous because it in-volves sufficient heat so that a careless or inexperienced user of the sol-dering iron can burn himself or herself or burn holes into clothing or fur16o WIRE AND METAL CRAFT niture . It is tricky because solder is hard to control . The metal surfaces to be joined must be perfectly clean and properly covered with flux . The soldering iron must be tinned . The less solder used and the more evenly it is applied , the more durable the adhesion . Before soldering wire or sheet metal , all ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely free of grease , dust , rust , or fingerprints . Clean these surfaces and the soldering iron tip with emery paper , holding the metal at places that will not be soldered . Then give the surfaces to be soldered and the soldering iron tip a thin , even coating of flux . Heat the soldering iron and " tin " it by covering the tip with a film of solder . Rest the iron on an asbestos pad , wire stand , or brazier edge , and away from any flammable surface . Hold the material to be soldered in the vise or place it on asbestos pad or brazier . Never solder on a wooden surface . 167 . Drip Soldering Solder , dripped with a heated iron onto a metal plate , forms interesting shapes and patterns . This sculpture or jewelry-making technique is a useful first exercise in soldering . It acquaints the young craftsman with the characteristics of the tools and materials and allows him to acquire control ( see diag. 167 , and 166 ) . 168 . Wire Soldering Table 161 This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making , and electric circuit wiring . Two wire ends to be soldered can be twisted together ( see diag. 168 ) or , if the wire is heavy , soldered end to end . Clean the wire with emery paper , and hold it in place in the vise or on the brazier ( see 166 ) . Apply flux to the joint and soldering iron . Tin the iron and heat it and the solder until the solder starts to melt , at the same time applying the iron to the wire ends to be joined . Use a minimum of solder ? no more than required to coat the joint thinly . If the solder does not flow evenly across the joint or if it forms into small beads , the chances are that the joint is not clean or is improperly fluxed , or that the soldering iron is too hot . In that event , heat the joint with the iron until the solder drips off and start again as at first , cleaning , fluxing the metal , and tinning the iron . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess solder with a file and emery paper or cloth . 169 . Sweat Soldering Table Sweat soldering is the preferred method when soldering surfaces other than wire or edges of metal . Cut the sheet or strips of solder into small squares . Place these at more or less regular intervals onto the cleaned and fluxed surface of the blank to which other metal shapes are to be soldered ( see diag. 169 ) . Then position the cleaned and fluxed metal shapes to be adhered on top of the solder squares . Using the soldering iron , heat the tops of the metal shapes until they transmit the heat to the solder and it begins to flow and create a bond . // Test the adhesion after the metal cools . If the joint is not firm , remove the metal parts , clean and flux all surfaces , and begin as before . When the metal has cooled remove any solder that has bled out from under edges with files and emery paper or cloth ( see 152 ) . 170 . Soldering Edge to Surface Table Parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or held in a vise , and that do not remain in place , must be held together with wire and positioned on an asbestos pad or brazier . Place small portions of solder wire against the cleaned and fluxed joint and heat with the tinned iron ( see diag. 170 ) ; the solder will flow into the joint . ( See 168 if the solder beads and does not flow. ) 163 171 . Collage Soldering Table Use any of the various soldering techniques described in 166-170 , depending on the nature of the individual metal pieces to be adhered . 172 . Assemblage Soldering Table Clamp or wire parts into position before soldering , whenever the assemblage can not be laid on its side or parts placed flat on top of surfaces to which they are to be adhered . Use whatever soldering techniques are appropriate ( see 166-171 ) . 173 . Chain Links Table Form individual wire chain links , using the wire forming jig or a metal tube or rod locked into the vise ( see diag. 173. a ) . Cut each formed link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another as a chain ( see diag. 173. b ) , or can serve as hinges attached to metal blanks into which holes have been drilled ( see diag. 173. c ) , or can be soldered to them ( see diag. 173. d ) . After attaching the links in one or another of the methods de164 WIRE AND METAL CRAFT scribed , squeeze each one closed with the pliers and solder the closures in turn ( see diag. 173. e , and 166 and 168 ) . G. DECORATING METAL 174 . Painting Most metals , other than untreated galvanized iron , can be enameled . But this process involves extremely high temperatures and is unsuitable for young craftsmen . However , any metal ( except galvanized ) can be painted with enamel paints or with japan and oil colors ( see 227 and 244 ) . Be sure to remove all dirt , grease , or rust from the metal surface with emery cloth before painting . Do not allow children and young people to use spray cans , and observe the cautions on the container label for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175 . Combining Metals and Other Materials Interesting decorative effects are obtained in metal by working in relief ( see 162 ) and by gluing or soldering different metals to one another ( see 166 ? 172 ) . Other materials ? wood , leather , or fibers ? also can be combined with metals . For example , leather thong or wool can be laced around metal edges ; wood and metal can be inlaid or combined for collages and assemblages ; tin or copper can be used to cover a wooden shape and so achieve substance and dimension without weight . Leather Craft Never forget the material you are working with , and always try to use it for what it can do best. ? William Morris A. BACKGROUND American Indian tribes cured animal skins by salting and burying them in wood-chip-and-water filled holes dug into the ground , and then drying and working them until they became pliable . Eskimo women still scrape and chew reindeer skins with their teeth to make them durable and soft enough for wearing . Tanning and tooling of leather were known among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China this craft was perfected even earlier . The ancient Jews discovered how to preserve hides with oak bark , and they used leather for making ritual articles , sandals , leggings , and shields and armor , as did the Greeks and Romans . Some of the first craft guilds were formed by British and European leatherworkers in the fourteenth century . Two different guilds became responsible for the preparation of animal skins ? the tanners and the skinners . The tanners preserved fur-free skins for makers of shoes , belts , gloves , purses , saddles , carriages , harnesses , and sword sheaths , // and for armorers and clothiers . The skinners prepared hides on which the animal 's fur remainea. for furriers who made coats , cloaks , jackets , stoles , hats , trim , and other articles of fashion . The tanners soaked the animal skins in lime water for twelve hours to loosen flesh and hair before stretching them over smooth , bark-free logs to scrape them clean . The cleaned skins were then placed into three different vats in turn , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak bark and water . The hides stayed in the first vat for up to thirty days ; in the second for up to three months ; and in the final one for from four to seven months . The tanned leather was scraped and shaved once more , rubbed with a mixture of tallow and neat's-foot oil , washed with a soda and lime solution , dried , dyed , and finally polished with a smooth stone . Thick leather was split with sharp knives into thin layers for finer apparel like gloves . In the nineteenth century most of these processes were mechanized . Cutting , working , and tooling leather take time and patience even when they are done by machine . But the ancient ways of working are still practiced in Morocco , India , and Mexico , and to a lesser extent by a few remaining European and American craftsmen . 167 Leather from various animal species has different thickness , texture , and other characteristics . With the threatened extinction of many species of wildlife due to their merciless destruction for the sake of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ever be used for craft . Cowhide is used most commonly for shoe leather and soles . It is difficult to work unless split , especially in inexperienced and weaker than adult hands . Split cowhide can be cut easily with scissors and worked by young children . Calfskin , steerhide , sheepskin , pigskin , and goatskin in various grades are obtainable from tanneries and craft supply houses . Suede is the flesh side of the leather regardless of its source . Leather can be bought in whole and half skins , in sides , and as findings . The back side of the skin is the most valuable , fault-free grade . Findings are small cutoff remnants left over after the better portions of the skins have been used in manufacture and by craftsmen . The best material for work by children and beginning young craftsmen , they are available from tanneries , shoemakers , leatherworkers , and craft supply houses . Like all leather , they should be stored flat , grain side up , on an open shelf . Leather thong ? thin strips of leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive . Vinyl lacing , while lacking the quality of the organic material , is a useful substitute , available from craft material suppliers . The first efforts in leatherwork by children should be spontaneous . Earliest projects involve activities that familiarize children with the characteristics of the material and with the techniques and tools required to work it successfully . More mature young people should be encouraged to make paper templates and mock-ups ( see 67 and 68 ) before working with the leather itself . Many of the paper and foil craft techniques ? punching ( see 5 ) , lacing ( see 7 ) , weaving ( see II.G ) , scoring , scribing , and cutting ( see II.F ) ? are essential preparations for leather craft . They involve similar , and in many cases identical , procedures , in less expensive , more easily worked , and expendable materials . B. BEGINNING LEATHER CRAFT 176 . Scissors Cutting and Gluing Table Leather is usually cut with a sharp knife . However , young children can cut split leather with ordinary scissors . Split leather scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallets , purses , and gloves . Scissors-cut split leather can be glued to itself or to cardboard , wood , metal , felt , and other materials . Rubber cement , both sides mounted dry ( see 23 ) , is the most commonly used and effective adhesive . Slip-sheet the material ( see 24 ) and , once the leather is positioned and glued , tap it with a mallet and then clean off excess cement with a rubber cement eraser ( see 20 ) . White vegetable , casein , and acrylic glues are also used . Rye flour paste , which can be made at home ( see 18 ) , adheres leather especially well . Suggest that a minimum of glue be used for such pasting so that it does not stain the leather . Brush two or three light coats of the rye flour glue on both surfaces . Press the leather together before the glue dries . 169 Wipe off any excess with a damp cloth , then place the leather between two pieces of wood larger than the glued surfaces and hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or more , until the glue is complely dry . 177 . Collage and Applique Table Split leather from different hides , or dyed in a variety of stains , can be used for collages and assemblages ( see 27 , 28 , 96 , and 111 ) . Cut into very small pieces , leather can be used as mosaic modules ( see 29 and 289 ) ; use the adhesives suggested in 176 . Applique consists of pasting smaller pieces of leather to a larger piece . 178 . Stamping and Punching Table The listed punches and chisels are required for basic leatherwork , though one of each suffices for beginners . Punching holes into leather is the first step for all lacing ( see 179 ) , sewing ( see 186 ) , and studding and grommeting ( see 185 ) . Demonstrate how a line is marked with a ruler and soft pencil wherever the leather is to be laced , sewn , or grommeted . After marking with a pair of dividers the places on the line where the holes are to be made ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chisel of a size that matches the lace , thread , or grommet to perforate the leather ( see diag. 178. b ) . All punching dies , including the revolving punch , can be hammered with a mallet . Two different hole patterns are generally used for lacing around the edges of leather . The first consists of holes punched in a straight line ( see diag. 178. c , and 179 ) . The second consists of alternate , staggered holes for a different lacing effect ( see diag. 178. d , and 179 ) . The
