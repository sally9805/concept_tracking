THE GAMBLER <P> Directed by KAREL REISZ Screenplay by JAMES TOBACK <P> One of the inescapable commonplaces of popular psychology is the belief that compulsive gambling , like alcoholism , is a disease and its victims are more to be pitied than censured . Clinically speaking , that view makes good sense . But dramatically it is something of a downer . <P> So step right up and meet Axel ( James Caan ) , the gambler as existential hero , a man determined to risk not only money but the love of family , a good woman ( Lauren Hutton ) and self . Why ? <P> Because , it would seem , he has read too much Dostoyevsky . From literature 's most famous betting freak he has learned that the essence of heroism lies in seeking out risks you do not have to take . In Axel 's case , recklessness takes the form of exercising a willed belief that Harvard and ten is a credible basketball bet . <P> This way , of course , lie only madness and despair , but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boring advantages-a well-to-do family , a proper education . Indeed , when he has a few minutes to spare from the morning line he teaches literature in a New York City college . He knows-oh God , does he know-what he is doing . He is nearly consumed with self-awareness . <P> As we meet him , he is dropping $44,000 in what used to be known as a " gambling hell . " The rest of the film is devoted to his efforts to settle this debt before the Mob settles his hash . That should be an easy matter-Mom , after all , has 44 grand which our boy obtains through brief cajolery . But paying off the bad guys is just too simple for a self-made Dostoyevskian man . He must risk the bundle in Las Vegas ( where he doubles it ) , then lose it all on some unwise basketball bets . He finally settles the matter by getting his favorite student -a black - to shave points in a game , then expiate that sin by provoking a black pimp and whore to punish him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too neat , this balancing of the moral books , just as Axel 's character is too contrived for the movie to be emotionally gripping . We are too aware of Writer Toback 's undigested intellectual debts as well as his rather adolescent romanticizing of his subject . Nor has London-based Director Reisz ( Morgan , Saturday Night and Sunday Morning ) fully absorbed any of the milieus through which The Gambler moves . Most of the time he seems to be taking snapshots for an album to be called something like " Colorful Habits of the Natives . " <P> As for Caan , he is too trim and cool ever to make us believe that he is more interesting than any other spoiled child . To be sure , he is attempting a difficult thing - acting out the role of gratuitous self-torture - but his performance is never really as vertiginously mad as it should be . The whole film is just a fantasy about going crazy , a fantasy never for a moment in danger of becoming the genuine article . R.S.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
