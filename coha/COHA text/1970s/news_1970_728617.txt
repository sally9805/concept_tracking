txt Robert H. Finch , hospitalized by a puzzling arm ailment , today sent a message endorsing the movement of American troops into Cambodia to 800 Federal employes he had been scheduled to meet to hear complaints of his leadership of the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . John G. Veneman , Under Secretary of the department , read the statement to the employes , many of whom had been critical of Mr. Finch 's actions as Secretary . Hisses and boos punctuated the reading , underscoring the discontent that many people within and without the department have voiced because Mr. Finch had refused to criticize the troop move . The critics have felt that the Secretary , who is usually regarded as the liberal voice in the Cabinet , should have spoken out against the Cambodian affair because it has divided the country . Walter Reed Army Hospital , to which Mr. Finch was admitted at 2:30 P.M. , reported that he was being " evaluated for neurological involvement of his left arm .

" He voiced his support for Mr. Nixon 's Indochina decisions . He added , " If I did n't think they were gettaing out by the end of June . . . " He did not finish the sentence . Secretary Finch has been bombarded by telegrams and letters asking him to condemn the move into Cambodia and to rebut the statements of Vice President Agnew concerning dissension . " I am not going to get in a whipsaw with the Vice President , " he said . Affirms Integration Goal A second statement prepared by Mr. Finch that also was to have been read this afternoon reiterated his position " that I personally am committed , that this department is committed , and that the Administration is commiteated unequivocally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was demanded 10 weeks ago by more than 2,000 health , education and welfare employes who had sought an explanation from Mr. Finch of the Government 's seemingly ambivalent attitude toward desegregation . Petitions calling for the meeting were circulated only days deleted 15 lines The strain was reflected by his countenance this morning . He was obviously tired and spoke slowly in a low voice . It is two months since Senator George Murphy , Republican of California , decided to seek re-election this fall . Mr. Finch , who was known to covet Mr. Murphy 's seat , has been working nights and weekends trying to solve what he freely admitted are tremendous problems in his department . Mr. Finch 's aides have said that school desegregation problems , student unrest and thel uproar over Cambodia have added to his burdens . Complicating the obvious strain on his health , Dr. Finch , while on a brief vacation in Mexico two months ago , contracted an uncommon intestinal infection caused by a protozoan organism named Giardia lamblia .

" Mr. iFnch received a telephone call from the President this afternoon inquiring about his condition , White House aides announced . Early tonight the hospital reported that the Secretary would at least spend the night there pending completion of examinations and laboratory tests . In the statement read by Mr. Veneman , Mr. Finch , who met and became friendly with Mr. , Nixon almost 25 years ago , said he stood behind the President because " his goal in Vietnam is to end the fighting and the killing . " " And every decision he has made has been consistent with that goal  --  Vietnamization , the phased withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cambodian sanctuaries , " he continued . " United States forces will be out of Cambodia on or before June 30 . " The readiing of this part drew hisses three times . The statement said : " I reiterate my support of the President in his commitment to end the war in Vietnam because only then can we totally and effectively address our long list of domestic concerns . " Mr. Finch warned : " The nation can not move forward in the present highly-charged atmosphere of anger , fear , mistrust and recrimination . It is not sufficient simply to lower our voices : we must sincerely want to listen , and to understand what people really are trying to say to one another . " In the second statement dealing with desegregation , Mr. Finch said : " This department will enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act because the law requires it ; because education development is greatly aided by it ; and , more importantly , because elementary concepts of humanity demand it .
