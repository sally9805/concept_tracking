BLAZING SADDLES <P> Directed by MEL BROOKS <P> Screenplay by MEL BROOKS , NORMAN STEINBERG , ANDREW BERGMAN , RICHARD PRYOR , ALAN UGER <P> A certain number of sissies are bound to go around condescending to Blazing Saddles as a comedy of less than perfect form . They will note that it lacks the careful construction and polished wit that are often cited by essentially humorless people , usually to justify the minor cultural sin of having a good time at a movie that is less than 35 years old and does not star either the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields . <P> It is easy to forget that a lot of the old comedians ' gags did not quite come off either . Their movies , too , might have been even funnier had their scripts been edited more rigorously and directed more artfully instead of being produced on the **31;2944;TOOLONG principle of comedy . Like its many raucous predecessors , Blazing Saddles is a thing of bits and bits-some good , some awful-pinned to a story line that sags like a tenement clothesline . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edits out ineptitudes , the better to dwell on moments of glory . <P> Saddles is about a hip black sheriff who must overcome racial prejudice and the machinations of a corrupt frontier political machine . With very little help , he manages to save the citizens of Rock Ridge from being driven away so that a railroad may pass more cheaply through their land . But so what ? The important thing is that the chief villain is named Hedley Lamarr , and the actors insist on mispronouncing his name ; that at a town meeting an anguished citizen complains that " people are being stampeded and the cattle raped " ; that a black labor gang , ordered to sing a Negro spiritual by their straw boss , respond with a nice arrangement of Cole Porter 's I Get a Kick out of You ; that ex-Football Tackier Alex Karras , on hand to play a homicidal moron , gets in a fight with a horse and fells it with a single roundhouse blow ; that Cleavon Little , as the heroic sheriff , has saddlebags by Gucci . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film is too fast and furious for its own good . Still , the scene in which everyone is grouped around the old chuck wagon enjoying a good old-fashioned bean supper is in itself a high point in the short history of screen scatology . Even more flamboyant is the ending in which the entire cast , engaged in a classic western brawl , breaks through the wall of an adjoining sound stage , where a campy musical-tails , top hats and lots of white platforms-is being shot . In the ensuing effeminate uproar , hearty Slim Pickens punches out the jodhpur-clad director of the film next door , while Cleavon Little ducks out to Grauman 's Chinese Theater and watches ... Blazing Saddles . <P> The whole raveled sequence is the work of men desperate for an ending . It is also in bad taste , though it can not stand comparison to Brooks ' most egregious caper , the Springtime for Hitler number in The Producers . But goldarned if it does n't work . Goldarned if the whole fool enterprise is not worth the attention of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on another 's Gabby Hayes imitation , calls " authentic western gibberish. "
