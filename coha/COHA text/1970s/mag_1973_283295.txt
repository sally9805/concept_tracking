Guam 's Andersen Air Force Base was the chief jumping-off point for U.S. bombers during the days between the sudden U.S. resumption of the bombing and its equally sudden cessation last week . When TIME Correspondent Herman Nickel visited the huge B-52 fleet there last April , the mood was mild and the pilots easygoing . Last week Nickel found a far grimmer spirit-at least until the bombing runs over the North were halted once again . His report : <P> FOR three full hours a seemingly endless stream of the huge war machines thundered past Charlie Tower , at the end of Andersen 's 12,000-ft. runway , to get final takeoff clearance . Then they roared mightily down the gentle decline of the salad-bowl-shaped runway , howled back up the last stretch before finally lifting their 490,000 lbs . off the ground , jet exhausts trailing thick clouds of black smoke . <P> First off were more than 30 B-52Gs , recognizable by their light beige underbellies and the absence of bomb racks under their wings ; their 20,000 lbs . of bombs are crammed into barn-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably the world 's meanest-looking aircraft , with two dozen 500-lb. bombs clustered on racks under the wings and 42 stubby 750-pounders inside . Painted pitch black , they looked like the birds of death that they are . Of all the 80 or so aircraft I watched depart , only one of them had to use its " drag bag " - the drag parachute used to abort a takeoff because of a technical difficulty . A reserve craft quickly took its place . That mass departure , timed to the split second , was a feat the Strategic Air Command ought to teach the world 's commercial airlines . <P> The ferocious intensity of the raids stunned even the 11,000 airmen at Andersen and the 90,000 Guamanians for whom the sight of B-52s and bomb-laden trucks has been routine since 1965 . Base security measures were tighter than ever : information officers would not comment on operational matters ; pilots and crewmen were ordered not to talk to outsiders . Such strictness was understandable-but almost certainly the North Vietnamese knew far in advance that the raiders were on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guam is a radar-studded Soviet trawler that works just a few miles west of the island . <P> Perhaps the greatest single reason for the new grimness here was that air and ground crews knew there now was a good chance that not all the planes would return . " We 've got a hell of a lot more excitement than we ' need these days , " said a veteran of 238 Viet Nam missions . In fact , the chances of being shot down over the North were slightly greater than was the case in the B-17 and B-24 days of World War II . Then the loss rate was one to 64 ; last week it was closer to one to 50 . <P> The strain showed . More than anyone else , the airmen wanted to believe that peace was indeed at hand . " The letdown was just killing , " said Captain James H.S. Train , a veteran of more than 200 missions who is now on his sixth combat tour . " We 're just hanging on by our fingernails . " Later another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more peace rumors. "
