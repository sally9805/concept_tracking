RITREA is Ethiopia 's northernmost province-45,000 square miles of mountains and desert bordering the Red Sea just north of Africa 's " Horn . " It is Ethiopia 's only outlet to the sea , and the peacetime population has been about 2 million , but within the past couple of years 200,000 of these people have taken refuge in the neighboring Sudan because of the civil war going on . The Eritreans ' war for independence from Ethiopia began with a few skirmishes in 1962 , when Haile Selassie ( not for no reason known as the " King of Kings " ) annexed the territory to his own country , after a United Nations mandate had rather clumsily " federated " it to Ethiopia , with semi-autonomous status , ten years before . Between 1941 and 1952 Eritrea had been administered by the British , who took it from the Italians early in World War II . Previously it had been part of Italian East Africa , the Italians having gained their ascendancy in 1890 . For three centuries before that , Ottoman , Egyptian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thousand years before that , it was the heartland of the Christian kingdom of Aksum . Haile Selassie was overthrown in Addis Ababa in 1974 . The swiftly radicalized governing Dergue ( which is Amharic for " committee " ) sharply stepped up the emperor 's military campaign to beat back Eritrean secession , but in so doing only furthered the Eritrean Liberation Front cause . Meanwhile other corners of the Ethiopian empire were coming unstitched , notably the Ogaden region near Somalia . And the Dergue was shifting away from the emperor 's old alliance with the Americans and toward the Soviet camp , and also aiding continual attempted coups against President Gaafar Numeiri in the Sudan , thereby losing the good offices Numeiri had been trying to exert to mediate the Eritrean war so that the refugees , who were an unsettling influence in his own country , could go home . Early in 1977 I was in the Sudan , and I met many young Eritreans who had been invalided out of the fighting . Because I was a journalist they knocked at my door with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much preoccupied with the matter of which rivals they wanted to kill even among the several factions of the insurrection , putting their hands together to show me how so-and-so should be handcuffed for questioning . Mostly this was just talk . When applying for a passport ? a futile process ? they used to go to the embassy of the hated Dergue itself in Khartoum without killing anybody . " These are my golden years , wasted ! " a haggard boy named Issayas said , at the Hotel Metropole , plucking angrily at his porter 's tunic . He had left the city of Keren with bath a technical-school diploma and a case of amoebic dysentery for which he still could not afford treatment . In Keren , he claimed , the Ethiopians had killed something like 750 civilians in search operations in 1975 , and finally his father had told him to run for his life ; but in the two years since , he had n't been able to get word back that he was alive . Even down in Juba , near the Sudan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eritrean conspirators , disguised as gospel workers but shepherding a series of sardonic , shifty-looking agents in and out of town , en route to Kenya and Somalia . They wanted me to write about them also , but in the nit-picking manner of so many revolutionaries , would talk to me only if I guaranteed that what I found to say was going to be wholly favorable . For all my curiosity about the guerrillas ? the strategy of their raids , their weapons-buying , their passionate provincialism ? the obsession with killing and ideological purity was soon too much for me . Then came the chance to go into Eritrea itself with two newsmen , crossing a dry riverbed at Karora a few days after the town had fallen to the rebels in the first of a domino sequence of victories that they won during 1977 . The houses of the town had been destroyed beforehand by the Ethiopian troops , and there were rumors of mass graves of some of the 5,000 civilians who had once lived nearby . But now the Eritreans , in green fatigues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare , had raised their pretty azure flag with a rosette of olive leaves and appropriated the trenches and machine-gun sites . Most of them were hardly twenty years old , blooming with the ideal of the classless state that they were going to build . They were of the " Eritrean People 's Liberation Front , " and they had taken the town while a contingent of the Eritrean Liberation Front that had invested Karora for eight months continued to hold the hills . Nevertheless , they would not permit the ELF partisans to enter now ; had fired at them in the flush of victory when they tried . " Comrade , " " Brother " came out as every second word , but along the path to the latrine stood a cardboard box heaped with the love letters of the Ethiopian soldiers they had beaten . " That 's our toilet paper , " said our young guide , with his fine-boned , brown skin , endearing grin , and Afro hair , Chairman Mao 's Thoughts riding red-bound in his breast pocket . This is the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I will call him ? was a Sudanese newspaperman ; and we had an English boy along , a would-be free-lance journalist from Liverpool with a brush haircut , who had been teaching English in Omdurman to classes of sixty kids at a time , and was with us to represent the Khartoum stringer for one of the London newspapers . We drove for a day and a night by Land Rover through Hadendowa country . The Hadendowas are Cushites , not Arabs , and not by tradition the friendliest people in the Sudan , even to each other , except for the family bond . Izz Abdel said we ought to have brought a policeman with us for safety 's sake , but that because these people associated Land Rovers with government bigwigs they would probably leave us alone . In fact , every time we stopped at a campsite to ask directions across the desert hardpan , the women and children shrieked and ran away , imagining that we might be a team of doctors who proposed to inoculate them . Our driver , Abdullah ? which means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin , faithful man with a V-shaped face , scars nicking his brows and forehead . His whispery , musical voice was that of a person raised in the desert mountains , whose gentlest enunciation there might have carried for a mile in the soft air . But he had never been to Eritrea . Neither had Izz Abdel . The latter , a quick-paced , calculating , opportunistic fellow of fifty , was just the sort who in America would be a millionaire . As it was , he told me , one way or another , he had earned enough to live on " for twenty years " ? nodding to indicate that that ought to be long enough for him . Although in Cairo the souls one sees prostrate in prayer in public places are mostly laborers and the poor , in Khartoum a professor of literature I was talking with grew increasingly restless at nightfall , until he broke off to go outdoors and kneel facing the east . Exactly so , this Khartoum entrepreneur ? whose identity I must conceal , yet who at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneur-type trick ? kept stopping the car at dawn . midday , midafternoon , sunset , and nightfall to go down on his knees , after first washing his hands and feet with sand . On our way , we had already stopped at the Sudanese town of Gebeit to visit the Ethiopian prisoners of the battle of Karora , who had chosen to give themselves up to the Sudanese army rather than suffer incarceration at the hands of the Eritreans ? a saltless , meatless , EBEIT WAS A little town , reachable from Port Sudan by a narrow , stony track that twisted between wild , leopardy , slag-colored hills , with a minaret and water tower standing against the evening sky when we got there . Because the telephone line was down , the garrison was caught almost as much by surprise as were the prisoners when our headlights swept into the central square . Later , the Syrian went home to Damascus ; the Tunisian fell in with two Frenchmen who were setting forth from the Red Sea to sail around the world but had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London newsmen embroiled themselves in a quarrel with the commissioner of Red Sea Province over whether he should furnish his one helicopter for all of us to fly to Karora , which resulted in their staying behind in Port Sudan . But for now , with our cameras or notebooks at the ready , into the common barracks we rushed . These were privates , sergeants , corporals , ninety-six of them , lying in their fatigues on two rows of white-sheeted cots , in a 200-foot building , with three weak light bulbs and four water jugs . A jolt of fear went through them , naturally . They had been under siege in Karora for eight months and ? now fallen into the hands of these new but ancient enemies from Islam ? were not as yet convinced they were n't about to lose their lives . One man was so startled he sprang onto his bed and stood teetering there . Every one of them went to a cot , most sidling over and quickly lying down , some on their faces , some masking their noses or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be photographed . For a moment nobody in that long barren room would admit to speaking either Arabic or English because to do so might involve being quoted . Like Abdullah , these were mountain people accustomed to speaking in hums and clicks and whistles , in murmured whispers , up high in a terrain where they could hear the wings of birds a mile or more away . The mountains of Ethiopia are much higher , however , and the very notes of fear and nervousness they uttered amounted to a sort of poignant twitter , ending in silence . I knew that in Ethiopia repatriated war prisoners at their luckiest were likely to find themselves officially " dead " ; no working papers or other identification were given to them by which they might resume their existence . So , as one young man was provoked by the sight of the cameras to break into an anguished remonstration , I began walking the length of the barracks slowly and quite sadly . " I have no need to be photographed ! " he cried , practically weeping ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treatment appropriate to a surrendered en-emy prisoner . Two other Ethiopians also stood in front of the Sudanese and English who were holding cameras , seeking c , to keep them back . c1 " I have no need to do this ! I will dig my ' grave if I do this ! " the private protested , as spokesman , in his mission-college English . I was looking for a face that might show a willingness to talk to me , among these sorrowful , humiliated figures , each stretched out gangling , tense , and motionless , as if I were a striped hyena that had got loose in the room . None of them was in the slightest willing , and gradually , by the time I reached the far end , I had stopped looking and was delaying my steps , closing my eyes in order to try to absorb some memory of the rancid misery . It was tasteable ? like a mist ? and African as well as merely military , so that it did not connect very well with my own army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the newspapermen , I could join the argument on the Ethiopians ' side . The Daily Express man had been joking as we drove to Gebeit that the commanding general in Port Sudan would already have phoned ahead to " paste their fingernails back on . " But here we were , after a bumpy ride , including two flat tires , the jackals howling as we 'd watched poor Abdullah wrestle with the spares , and nobody would give him a story . " There 's no lead " he kept complaining loudly , pushing for an angle , pushing for the sake of pushing , anyway , though he did n't want to put anybody 's life in jeopardy , either . The reporter from the Telegraph was a languid-looking Cambridge graduate who told us he had eaten Mangabey monkey on the Congo River , although just now , like his colle'ague from the Express , he felt disgruntled and outflanked because a BBC reporter named Simon Dring had already gotten clear past interviewing these prisoners two days ahead of us , and into Eritrea at Karora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nakfa , which the Eritreans currently had under siege . Dring was an intrepid professional , known for his exploits in Pakistan and Vietnam . Once again he was in there , as they said a first-rate reporter should be . They were scared the Eritreans might stage a special attack on Nakfa for him to film , and were trying to piece together an account of what was happening from secondary sources closer to Khartoum to telex to London before he got out of Eritrea , in order to take the shine off whatever news and film he bad . " A wink is as good as a nod to a blind man , " said Jimmy Brash , the Express man . He joked under his breath about " Kaffirs , " seeing how loud he could say it without being overheard . The Telegraph photographer was a square-set bloke with a bad back , older and raunchier than the others . While we 'd waited in the anteroom of the commissioner of Red Sea Province , he 'd pointed out the window at one of the herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to pull on a pair of Wellie hoots and screw those blondies . When there was a chance , he skinned off his Hawaiian sport shirt and exposed his pinkand-white , scantily furred chest to the sun . " Saves going to Monte Carlo . " Naturally , this confabulation of the English press had not occurred to celebrate a minuscule guerrilla victory in a landscape of candelabrum , dragon 's blood , and toothbrush trees . Rather , the Eritreans had released , a few days earlier , a British contract-hydrologist named Ransom and his family from three months ' captivity . Unlike a number of previous kidnappings of Europeans and Americans who had wandered into guerrilla territory , there were three children and a pretty wife involved , and so the Telegraph , the Daily Mail , and the Sunday Mirror had flown in representatives to Khartoum to bid for first serial rights on the Ransoms ' story . But , according to Jimmy Brash , who walled his eyes at every discussion of missionary mentality , the Mirror man had gotten stranded temporarily in Nairobi , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tale out of Darkest Africa , Mr. Ransom said no , because he 'd already been offered ? 16,000 by the Daily Mail and he had shaken hands . The Red Sea Province commissioner , himself a graduate of the University of Manchester , was a somber , ironic man of forty-nine . He spoke with deadly contempt of the Ethiopians who had abandoned their post at Karora . " They did n't want to die , " he said with a collected ferocity and relish . He seemed coolly bemused by Brash and his two mates as social specimens , when we all sat down to tea in his office , but he was also alarmed , because Brash had drafted a telegram to President Numeiri concerning the matter of the helicopter . This wire , couched in terms of our being personal guests of both the president and the nation , was never sent , and only a couple of months later , as it turned out , the commissioner was elevated to a position in the Cabinet . Instead , we were told we could go overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gebeit , stayed in Port Sudan and interviewed a Sudanese major who had witnessed the final battle and accepted the Ethiopians ' surrender . Izz Abdel , Abdullah , I , and the boy from Liverpool set off . 0 T 'S CHARACTERISTIC of traveling in Africa that , a little while before , I had been told forthrightly by the same Sudanese major that I might be shot by the Eritreans if I tried to cross the border . " We have no communications with them . You would have to walk across the river alone , and they have a hunker facing where you would be . They would not know who you are and they would watch you come and decide what to do . Even we do n't know them yet . " In any event , I would not be permitted to reenter the Sudan . " It is not a legal crossing point . What you would do if they did n't like you , and how you would get out of there even if they did , I ca n't say , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dring , whose stunt in entering he did n't mention , had employed a daredevil free-lance Sudanese intelligence agent to smooth the way . But now , after the Londoners ' threatened telegram and Izz Abdel 's hard sell ? invoking me as a correspondent for the New York Times , since I was from New York City and because in order to he allowed to go , he needed me ? we were rolling . What we lacked was a map . There are so few roads in the Sudan , there are no road maps . No maps of any kind at this time were obtainable , except that through special dispensation of the American Embassy I 'd got hold of a twelve-bytwelve-inch sketch of the nation . Keeping one eye on old wheel ruts , we tilted this around to conform with the course of the sun . Izz Abdel ? who was as squat as he was bold , wore a black headcloth , later a white headcloth , and called on Allah frequently ? burst unexpectedly into laughter , remembering other adventures on the Uganda border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the wheel from Abdullah at the worst spots , as if to show the car who was its boss . After Tokar , we had no distinguishable roadway to follow . Tokar , at the delta of the Baraka River , flowing out of Eritrea , is the site of a cotton-growing scheme . Pilgrims to Mecca from West Africa historically have paused here in the cotton fields for a season to earn their boat passage across the sea . We arrived at dark , and it was easy to get stuck in the outflow from the irrigation ditches roundabout , or lost among the tractor tracks . For two hours the next morning , we headed out again mistakenly in the wrong direction . The town is spaciously laid out , but so lightless at night that the children must wait for the moon to wax to do much playing after the sun goes down , so poor and dispirited that several families had dug mud for their house bricks right from the street in front ? big pits ten feet wide and ten feet deep , extremely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of these people were Hadendowas , who speak Bedawiye before they learn Arabic , or Bani-Amer , whose native language is Tigre . So when my manipulative companion Izz Abdel tried , at the whitewashed Government Club , to procure supper for the four of us by appealing to the obsessive hospitality of Arab culture , he managed to conjure up only a cup of coffee and a glass of orange squash apiece . The members , at their card games , glared at us over one shoulder suspiciously . Meeting an Arab peddler leading a donkey in the desert that afternoon , Izz Abdel , in his practiced style , had stepped out of the Land Rover , patting his heart repeatedly and exclaiming , " There is no god but God ! " The peddler , who was a butcher ? his donkey festooned with goat rib cages and legs ? jerked the animal 's halter to bring it to a stop , and placed his right hand on his heart . " Mohammed is the Apostle of God ! " he said . " Bless the Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " the peddler answered . The whole four-part formula was gone through again . in a bountifully zestful , leisurely fashion . Then , too , again , the words for the first time starting to sound a little bit slurred , both men dropping their eyes from what I took to be the beginnings of boredom . Then yet again ? before Izz Abdel inquired after directions to Tokar ? by which time the entire fate of the peddler 's soul might seem to have been staked upon the accuracy of what he said . But these Hadendowa notables in their white sheets did not respond to Izz Abdel 's invocations except perfunctorily . Arabs hoard their women like water in the desert , but the Hadendowa women go unveiled . They do their share of herding , and will gallop on a camel across the sand like a man when they want to , carrying a wicked-looking cutlass , on occasion , which they grip when meeting a stranger ? gazing at you with scorn to forestall any incivility . Their tents are frog-shaped , constructed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair on a stick frame , the large mouth facing east . The men we saw , dressed in white , with a " fuzzywuzzy " hayrick of hair worn as high and proud as a Texan sports his hat , carried threefoot-long herding poles and narrow-bladed little brushwood hatchets , or one of their definitive . red-scabbarded , immense swords . At the time of Mandi , they defeated at least one British general with these , and later , in defeat , still charged and broke a British square , as in Kipling 's poem in praise of them . Approaching the elusive border HE FOLLOWING DAY , Izz Abdel had Abdullah stop every couple of hours so we could " pass water . " Then , " Gentlemen , prepare yourselves ! " ? when it was time to continue again . Black sand alternated after ten or fifteen miles with soft white sand , or thorn-tree savanna land , or brine flats by the sea , with the beach beyond . The emaciated , desert-colored dogs darting around the miserable mud shops we passed could muster enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies to piss successfully when they greeted one another . George , the journalist from Liverpool we had brought with us , was a Communist and had carried his Marx along , a paperback copy of Das Kapital to read if we broke down somewhere , or perhaps to impress the guerrillas ( it later seemed ) . Though he was sympathetic to the proletariat , and said his father was a lorry driver back home , he kept raging unreasonably at Abdullah for " stupidity " in driving . He claimed he was a pacifist , as well , and yet became exultant , bobbing up and down , when the first of what were possibly the Karora Hills materialized ahead of us , where the war would be . Izz Abdel acted less sanguine . Apart from not being sure where Karora itself was located , we did n't know where the line of the border lay ? had no guide or compass ? and did n't want to cross inadvertently , like a bunch of " spies . " Generally , as we traveled now , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mountains ? not the same ones , apparently ? a country where , a century ago , people may have carried gold from hidden workings to market , poured into hollow vulture quills . We knew that Eritrea was mountainous , but not where it began . George in the meantime was trying to argue Izz Abdel , not only into accepting the tenets of Marx , but out of his faith in the existence of God . Izz Abdel , though a broadminded , worldly man , snorted at such folly . " This is the Sudan , my friend . You are not among your bloody atheists in London ! " The Bani-Amer , a tribe related to the Hadendowas but hostile to them , live nearer the border and inhabit thatched-stick , rectangular hovels , patched with old tin , with an unbaked clay pot standing outside the door from which 49 50 gip ish , the police lieutenant , in his sabbath jibba , said . This was . where the British post commander used to meet with his Italian counterpart when Eritrea had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other here at the start of World Warn The army captain went through the bushes to the riverbank and hailed the Eritrean People 's Liberation Front lookout on the opposite side , telling him to call his officer . In due course , a stocky figure in olive drab scrambled down the sand slope , about a hundred yards away , and crossed . His name , he said , was Sheikh Omer . He was a smoldering , vigorous military man , dark-colored , fortyish , but still alight with pride in the victory that he had won , although he told us that he bore no proper rank , because in a people 's army such as his all fighters had an equal role . Not an individual whose prisoner I would like to have been , the sheikh , who had just recently been dealing with prisoners , cast a cold eye at me . Then , as Izz Abdel talked , he shook hands . I was dressed in a rumpled saltand-pepper Brooks Brothers summer suit and Oxford shoes , oddly enough , because this trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Port Sudan and return ( our Information Ministry escorts had washed their hands of us when we set off for the border ) . But though my strange costume and black briefcase looked incongruous in the setting , they probably acted to convince the sheikh that I was either an American foreign correspondent or , better yet , a U.S. government agent posing as a correspondent . He walked back across the riverbed to radio his superior , who was commanding the siege at Nakfa , for instructions , saying that a decision might take another hour . In the meantime , the Sudanese captain had sent a pickup truck to bring in the chief of the partisans of the Eritrean Liberation Front who had besieged the Ethiopians here from the crags above but had not managed to crank themselves up to the task of actually overrunning them . Now that the Ethiopians were . gone , the Sudanese were bulldozing a supply road to the ELF 's new headquarters at a ranchhouse on the valley floor , about a mile from the EPLF positions . ASH1R ABDUL KADAR was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , and furthermore would tend to favor him because he was a Muslim , and the ELF preponderantly Muslim ? armed and sup-ported by Arab countries such as Syria , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , and Yemen . The EPLF , originally predominantly Christian highlanders , had split off from the lowlanders of the ELF in 1970 in what began as a religious conflict , ushering in three years of civil war within the Eritrean independence movement itself . About 3,000 guerrillas on both sides are said ' to have been killed . Having been persecuted and driven to the highlands in historical times by the Muslims , most of the Christians of Eritrea at first had been indifferent to the war of independence waged by Eritrean Muslims against Haile Selassie 's army of Christians from Addis Ababa . Yet the Dergue made so little distinction between the religious affiliations of Eritrean villagers in its bombing and ground attacks that by the period of my visit , the ELF and EPLF were not killing each other , but merely planning their war strategy separately and holding territory " liberated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . Each organization boasted its own spots . The EPLF had 10,000 men under arms , altogether , the ELF perhaps 15,000 , but the EPLF was better and more boldly led . Its cadres were better educated , intellectually livelier and trendier , more urban and middle-class in origin , and Marxist in theory . They would tell you that the ELF was " tribal , " " regional , " and " backward . " but also " pan-Arab , " and thus not truly " national . " They claimed they fought mostly with captured ? which is to say , American ? weapons , not brand spanking new Kalashnikovs , such as the Saudis and Syrians had bought and boated to the ELF from Yemen . Both groups included Christians as well as Muslims now , and social democrats as well as Marxists , but the ELF , in answering the accusation that it was pan-Arab rather than nationalist , argued that ? on the contrary ? the Marxism of so many members of the EPLF rendered the EPLF beholden to outside ideologues and foreign powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a cheese-and-boiled-egg late lunch with Bashir Abdul Kadar on the second-story terrace of the police post . It was a breezy , pleasant spot , with pigeons bustling and cooing just above us on the corrugated roof . The Sudanese , after laying out our food , like good marriage brokers , withdrew . Mr. Kadar told us he was thirty-two and had been living as a revolutionary in the mountains for thirteen years . He had become such an ascetic , particularly during the drought and famine of 1975 , when the Ethiopians cut off international relief supplies being shipped to Eritrea 's civilians , that he allowed himself only one of the eggs and half the cheese that had been placed on his plate . Slender , emotional , idealistic-looking , in the style of a schoolteacher , with delicate Hamitic features and a fragile mustache under his checkered kakeh , he did n't alarm me , as had the flat and fearsome manner of the other commander . Through his interpreter he asked why they had never seen a Western journalist before . Why this prejudice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westerners who had entered Eritrea had been detained lately and , in some cases . never seen again . Why , asked the loquacious interpreter , did America , which had fought a revolution for self-rule , furnish the Fascist Dergue with F-5 jets and helicopters to attack them ? I said that the American government had favored Haile Selassie ? true enough ? but not the Dergue , and that the arms presumably were intended to counterpoise the Russian ordnance then still pouring into Somalia . George , however , elated as he was to be sharing a meal with genuine guerrillas , began to speak of the Imperialist-Oppressors Camp , versus the Peace-Loving Republics . He wanted them to know where he stood , and started ridiculing my explanation , condescending to me as a representative of capitalism and the Pentagon . " Of course , you would believe that ! " - The Eritreans threw each other an amused glance , to find us Anglos disagreeing . Without really accepting him as a fellow fighting progressive , the translator , who turned out to be the unit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socialist March . muttered to my colleague that if he 'd wanted to get into a political argument with me , why on earth had he not done so during our many boring hours in the car instead of waiting till these precious minutes of the interview ? Bashir Abdul Kadar seemed to feel the same . It was foolishness to harangue this visitor with gray in his hair and an American briefcase and suit . Interrupting his assistant , he got him to tell me that many Eritrean revolutionaries were not Communists at all ; that although Somalia helped them occasionally with passports and other small amenities , they received no weaponry from Somalia and had their own troubles with the Somalis ? as I already knew . in the wretched fashion of Africa , these two natural allies against Ethiopia , which stretched between them , were unable to coordinate their strategy freely . The Somalis were blood relations of the Issas , one of two inimical Islamic tribes inhabiting the tiny coastal French protectorate of Djibouti , wedged between Eritrea and Ethiopia proper and Somalia . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Afars , who were outnumbered by the Issas in Djibouti , and lived in danger of being massacred by them after the French left . I asked him whether my country 's M-14 rifles were of any use to his men , when they collected them from the Ethiopian dead . " Oh , it is a good rifle , yes , " he said , through the interpreter , smiling at that . " It is a rifle for an army , you understand . It is not as light and handy when you have to run up the side of a mountain . But what is important is not the rifle that a soldier uses . What is important is the man who holds the rifle . That is why the Eritrean people are winning against the Ethiopians . Not that we have Kalashnikovs . We are fighting for our homeland . " For all of his asceticism , he wore creamy tan pants and smoked a Benson &; Hedges , not the local Haggar brand of cigarette . In a modest way he identified himself as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front , and a member of its Revolutionary Council . He was naturally embarrassed that his EPLF rivals had come up underneath his machine gun and rocket positions and , after two weeks ' reconnaisance , had taken the town , when he had lain for so much longer in the rocks overlooking it . He had guessed that the approaches must be mined ; but when Sheikh Omer , after asking his consent , and with a force only slightly larger than his own ? about half the number of the entrenched Ethiopians ? launched a creeping assault from the direction of Nakfa , they did not encounter any mines . Starting four hours before sunset , the sheikh 's men had suffered just two wounded , hugging the lay of the land . Although they did n't reach the actual V of the perimeter trench that night , they had dug in presRed so close that the Ethiopians the next day sent in four helicopters from Asmara to ferry away their howitzers and other heavy equipment , lest these be captured by the Eritreans . The Ethiopians had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helicopters were going to fly back to evacuate the troops as well , the tough sheikh . in the small hours the following night , dispatched a party to seize the isolated outcrop spur from which the Ethiopians , with a .50-caliber machine gun . had protected their landing pad . They succeeded in doing just this , and so when , around noontime , five Ethiopian helicopters whirled in again to pick up the 115 defenders left , these could n't land . After much frustrated chatter , to which everybody in the valley with a radio listened avidly , they flew off . And that night the Ethiopians sewed together the white flag with which they had slunk across the river to the old British police post on Sudanese soil where we were now enjoying our lunch . Fourteen Ethiopian dead and four rearguard , now prisoners , were left behind . The EPLF , after realizing what was up , tumbled into their trenches , firing after them , but also shooting at the irregulars of the ELF , who dashed from the nearby ridges where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , the Christian sheikh now treated Bashir Abdul with blunt contempt , when Izz Abdel posed them for pictures . He almost refused to shake his hand , though this was partly political punctiliousness . Since I liked the gentler man , seeing him humiliated was painful . Mixed loyalties FTER THE picture-taking , Bashir Abdul returned to his enclave and we accompanied the sheikh across the river , keeping in his previous tracks in case the Ethiopians at some point had put mines down . Perhaps at Izz Abdel 's request , the Sudanese army captain tagged along ? I think , to be sure that we were permitted to return . In the Sudan it is the pattern that you can drive for four arduous days through the desert in order to spend what in retrospect has amounted to only a few hours at a village of naked dancers in the Nuba Mountains , for example ; then drive for four days back . There is a suddenness when things do happen , as on a sweltering afternoon when you have phoned the EPLF leader in Khartoum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex. pert . You tell the oddly accented voice where you live , and he says he will make inquiries about you . Meanwhile , you read The Plumed Serpent , uncomfortably aware of the narrow terrace overhanging the courtyard just outside the door , because , like the tightrope walker who must keep moving forward if he is to stay aloft , you simply ca n't sit still in this hotel for long . Abruptly , however , the man appears ? pop-eyed , burly , a tough cookie , as unan ? nounced as a commando , so that if this were an ambush you had laid for him you would be unprepared . The American ambassador , William Brewer , despite the heat and the tedium of his four-year stint in Khartoum . twice a day would make a run for it from his car into the lobby of the embassy building downtown , with his life like a football tucked under his arm , mindful that his predecessor , Ambassador Cleo Noel , had been shot dead by Black Septembrists in the job . The EPLF enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELF did not . Several of them , uniformed in baggy fatigues , jumped in the looped trenches to pose with the men for Izz Abdel 's camera . The sheikh gestured sarcastically at the Ethiopians ' breastworks as he led us around , and at the low buildings that had served as their barracks , holding his nose as if at the stench . A male nurse-midwife who had learned English in school introduced himself , telling me he was a Christian , but here was his best friend , who was a Muslim and fought alongside him . Here was a soldier who admired the Communism of Peking . but here was another who liked the Congress of the United States and wished Eritrea to have something like that . " We are many kinds of people , " he said , " and we are not paid to fight for our country . The Ethiopians are paid . " Briskly we climbed the spur dominating the helicopter pad to see the big Korean war ? type machine gun whose capture had meant so much . We went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and clambered to their best redoubt ? although no matter how high we scrambled , always another guerrilla stood up above us waving his Kalashnikov . Bashir Abdul Kadar had changed into a khaki uniform and was lecturing a class of herd boys .

Within a few weeks , as they had hoped , Nakfa fell . Then during the spring and summer and early fall the Eritreans took the cities of Keren , Tessenei , and Agordat , until by late 1977 , with only their intended capital of A smara and the fortified ports of Massawa and Assab remaining in Ethiopian hands , President Numeiri of the Sudan . working alongside the Saudis ? who said that they were prepared to bankroll sufficient weapons purchases to change the character of the guerrillas ' war ? finally forced the EPLF and ELF to merge . They had already coordinated the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somali Army and Somali Western Liberation Front in the Ogaden Desert in southern Ethiopia . In fact they had captured 95 percent of Eritrea . This was the period ? before the intervention of Russian generals using Cuban troops ? when the Dergue was running into disastrous logistical difficulties as it shifted from American to Soviet arms . Both its regular army and the gigantic Peasant Army conscripted for a holy war against the Muslims were routed . Afterward , remembering my exuberant hosts at Karora ? most of them purist Marxists young enough to be my sons ? I thought that what must have pained and bewildered and disillusioned them the most was not that Russian MiGs serviced and
