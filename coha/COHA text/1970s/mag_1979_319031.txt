" I must risk being called names to protect the country . " <P> Manila 's Malacan:ang Palace recalls an 18th century European royal court . At the top of a sweeping , **26;4263;TOOLONG , huge chandeliers dominate the great hall where Cabinet ministers , ambassadors and favor-seekers wait to be received in audience . Inside the President 's book-lined office , rows of brown leather chairs lead to his desk , which stands on a raised platform flanked by Philippine flags . In a palace interview last week with TIME Correspondent Ross H. Munro , Marcos exuded confidence as he talked about the future of his regime and his country . Despite rumors that he has serious medical problems the slender , black-haired President appeared to be thoroughly relaxed and in good health . He described the rumors that he is receiving kidney dialysis treatment as " ridiculous . " Excerpts : <P> Q. What do you consider the main accomplishments of the past seven years ? <P> A. I would say the most important is the change in the attitudes , the temper of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon the republic , democracy and the libertarian ideas that we have . We did not adopt the socialist or Communist ideology but instead preserved a free enterprise system committed to egalitarian ideals and the elimination of that wide gap between the rich and the poor . <P> Q. Why is martial law still justified ? <P> A. You in the Western world think of martial law as meaning the supremacy of the military over the civilian government . We know it only as the civil government using the military to enforce the civil law . Actually , the use of the term martial law was really unwise , illadvised . But whether you call it emergency rule , or a one-party system , as they have in other countries , the thing is that the martial law you speak of , which the Western world may find so odious , is not the same type of martial law that we have here . <P> Q. Under whatever label , why is this system still justified ? <P> A. Because it is something which is necessary for our own peculiar situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secessionist movement in Mindanao . While we are in the process , therefore , I believe that the national government should be armed with this power . We 've just received hard evidence to indicate a tie-up between the New People 's Army with the Moro National Liberation Front the Muslim separatist movement . In addition , the economic crisis came up . Since the economic crisis has dimensions that we can not actually now determine , I would rather play safe . I may be blamed for being overly cautious , but certainly meeting both the insurgency as well as the economic crisis at the same time , I do n't think this is the time to lift martial law . <P> Q. Would you be willing to announce a definite timetable for phasing out martial law ? <P> A. Tell me when the economic crisis will terminate and I will tell you when we can terminate martial law . Suppose something happens in Iran , suppose something happens in the Middle East . Suppose you adopt a worst possible scenario : there I am at the helm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these measures-and all of a sudden this economic crisis brings all these problems .
