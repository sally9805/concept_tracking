As one of the most successful magazines ever published , Playboy has inevitably inspired imitation . The newest entrant in the flesh-fun-fashion field , however , brings the flattery of emulation to the border of plagiarism . Gallery , which went on sale last week , carries a cover slug that is identical in arrangement and type face to Playboy 's , and is perhaps meant to be mistaken for it on newsstands by the nearsighted . <P> Inside Gallery , the Playboy pattern continues with astonishing fidelity . There is the " Gallery Interview " ( with Columnist Jack Anderson , who also happens to be Playboy 's interview subject for November ) , and a foldout " Gallery Girl of the Month . " The female caricature that decorates Playboy 's joke page is also to be found in Gallery , only this time she wears thigh-high boots instead of long stockings . But the quality of the new magazine 's writing and photography is not in the same league with Playboy 's ; although Gallery 's nudes are pretty and provocative , their charms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in layout is Gallery 's use of a symbol showing a lion inside a heart ( lionhearted , get it ? ) in place of Playboy 's bunny trademark . <P> Harmless Pastime . It is no accident that Gallery seems to be looking over Playboy 's shoulder . Editor James Spurlock , 26 , served three years in Playboy Publisher Hugh Hefner 's shop , and has installed Gallery 's staff of 17 in offices opposite Playboy editorial headquarters on Chicago 's North Michigan Avenue . Ronald Fenton , 38 , a onetime computer franchiser who is founder and chief stockholder of Gallery Enterprises , Inc. , says that " we 'll work our side of the street and let them work theirs . " <P> Fenton has brought in F. Lee Bailey , the celebrated criminal lawyer and a longtime friend of Hefner 's , to serve as the showcase publisher of Gallery . Cracks Bailey in Gallery 's first issue : " You may expect a Hefty supply of dressed and undressed ladies in our pages which we intend to be beautiful , sensual and stimulating . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest to see who can print the most daring display of pubic hair . " <P> So total was Gallery 's copying of Playboy in its first issue that Hefner 's lawyers started inspecting it for possible copyright infringement , and Bailey reportedly rebuked Spurlock for overdoing the imitation . Gallery 's next issue is to be partly redesigned , but Fenton is unworried . " All magazines , " he says blandly , " have similarities . "
