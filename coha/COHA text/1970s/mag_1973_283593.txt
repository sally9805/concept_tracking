In the 18 years that have passed since the last Soviet occupation forces left Austrian soil , that tiny gateway nation of Middle Europe had gained friends by being evenhanded to East and West and openhearted to anyone in trouble . When Hungarians fled the Russian repression of 1956 , they were sheltered in Austria . When the " Prague Spring " ended in 1968 , exiled Czechs came to Austria . Lately the troubled journeyers have been Soviet Jews en route to Israel , who used Vienna as a way station . <P> Last week , with a single decision , Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky had smudged his country 's reputation and thrown it into an international whirl of protest . Until international attention was diverted by large scale fighting between Israel and Arab forces from Egypt and Syria , Kreisky 's crisis had provided daily headlines around the world , focusing interest on the difficult question of how the rights of Jews and others can be protected against the schemes of terrorists . Kreisky 's dramatic gesture came after three Russian Jews , on a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schnau Castle , had been taken prisoner and hustled to Vienna 's airport by two armed Arab fedayeen ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . Kreisky managed to get the captives freed unharmed , but the ransom was high : he announced that he was closing down Schnau . His decision raised consternation . But international criticism could not change Kreisky 's mind , nor could Israeli Premier Golda Meir , who rushed from a Council of Europe meeting in Strasbourg to Vienna to reason with him . Mrs. Meir spent two hours with Kreisky , but in the end the disappointed leader of Israel departed the Austrian Chancellery by a back stairway . <P> Mass demonstrations were staged throughout Israel and many Western countries by protesting Jews . Arabs , however , were euphoric , and Egypt even sent a Cabinet minister to Vienna to congratulate Kreisky . For Europeans , it had almost come down to a choice between Arab and Jew , and either way , Europe was serving as an arena for the conflict . That hardly made it any choice at all , since most Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blood feud . But Washington officially came down on the side of Israel . President Nixon consoled Kreisky for having to face " a painful decision , " then added : " We simply can not have governments-small or large-give in to international blackmail by terrorist groups .
