Editing , the late , Adlai Stevenson once observed , consists of separating the wheat from the chaff-and printing the chaff . Something like that , only worse , seems to have happened at TV Guide when it received a program listing for a now defunct local talk show on San Francisco-Oakland 's KTVU . The notice said that guests for the show on Sept. 20,1968 , would include Pat Montandon , a well-known Bay Area hostess who had written a book about giving imaginative parties on lean budgets , and an unnamed masked prostitute . TV Guide 's condensed version : " From party girl to call girl . Scheduled guest : TV personality Pat Montandon and author of How To Be a Party Girl . " Montandon sued , alleging that she had suffered " horrendously obscene phone calls , obscene letters and obscene objects in the mail . " Outright strangers , she lamented , had asked whether she really had been a prostitute , and one man even asked how much she charged . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her of $151,000 in damages from TV Guide ( accumulated interest brings the total to $190,000 ) . Said Montandon : " The money can never compensate for the pain I went through . "
