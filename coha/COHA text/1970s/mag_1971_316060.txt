Uncle Sam , Spensthrift Banker <P> A SPENDTHRIFT banker is a threat to the financial stability of his community-especially when his community is the whole non-Communist world . In many respects , the U.S. has adopted the role of global banker : it issues the currency ( dollars ) that other nations use to pay their bills and store up their savings ( in the form of official reserves ) . Unfortunately , however , the U.S. has developed persistently profligate habits , pouring out more currency than its clients need or want . Some 43.3 billion U.S. dollars are now , in the words of one Congressman , " sloshing around the world . " <P> The dollars have been pumped out by the U.S. balance of payments deficit-a term that sounds formidably technical but is quite simple in concept . The balance of payments is the grand total of money that Americans and their Government spend , lend and invest abroad , matched against total receipts from foreign sources . A deficit occurs when more money goes out of the U.S. than comes into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lately the gap between U.S. international spending and income has reached alarming proportions . Last year the U.S. spent a record $10.7 billion more than it took in , and by some estimates the figure totaled $5 billion during just the first quarter of 1971 . Among the reasons : <P> &gt; The U.S. military role in the world has continued to grow , while the power of the American economy , relative to the rest of the world , has dwindled . U.S. military expenditures abroad contributed an average $2.4 billion a year to the balance of payments deficit in 1960-64 , but last year the drain was $3.4 billion . The Viet Nam War alone siphoned out around $1.5 billion in 1970 . <P> &gt; U.S. tourists now spend as much abroad as the Pentagon does . Tourist expenditures , a relatively minor matter in the early postwar years , have increased in every year since 1946 . In 1969 , the last year for which total figures are available , tourists left $3.4 billion outside the U.S. <P> &gt; U.S. industry is pouring out money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rest of the world rose from a 1960-64 average of $4.5 billion annually to $6.4 billion last year . More than half that figure , $3.9 billion , represented corporate investments in foreign plants and facilities . The rest of the outflow was caused by such activities as the purchase of foreign stocks by Americans and short-term U.S. bank lending to foreigners . <P> &gt; Americans are buying more Volkswagens , Toyotas and Sony TVs . U.S. sales of goods and services to foreigners still exceed purchases , but this trade surplus has been shrinking and can no longer pay for as much of the military and tourist spending and corporate investment abroad as it once did . From $8.5 billion in 1964 , the trade surplus plummeted to $1.9 billion in 1969 . The surplus rose to $3.6 billion in 1970 , but that increase is less encouraging than it looks . Exports rose less and imports held up more than they have in past recession years-an indication that U.S. industry is losing its competitive strength .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
