txt George Wallace and Jimmy Carter square off again later this week in their struggle for Southern political supremacy ? but the real winner could be someone else . Carter and  --  Wallace forces collide Saturday ( Feb. 28 ) in South Carolina 's presidential-precinct caucuses , and neutral observers call the race very close .

Humphrey . If Governor Wallace is unable to turn out his supporters , despite four personal trips into the state including one this week , Mr. Carter could beat him . That would set the stage for a dramatic showdown between the two men in Florida 's presidential primary March O. South Carolina party officials , including Democratic state chairman Donald Fowler , are telling voters it is too early to commit themselves to either Mr. Carter or Mr. Wallace . Both men could be knocked out of serious contention by the time of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters to remain uncommitted until the current field of candidates is winnowed down .
