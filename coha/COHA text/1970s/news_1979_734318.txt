And now , when he could he at home with his wife and In-month-old child on Friday and Saturday nights , he 's standing behind a bar , mixing drinks to earn a second incense . These are hard limes for car sales-men " IT 'S READY cash , " said the man , who asked not to he named . " I work 68 to 72 hours a week , 4 ( 1 as a car salesman . And my wife works three nights a week while I stay up with the baby . And believe me , 10-month-olds do n't sleep the whole night through . " But it 's necessary In take up other things just to pay the hills . There 's no such thing as ' maintaining a way of life ' anymore . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I accept it . " ? The man 's plight is not unique among car salesmen , who are bearing the brunt of declining sales nn full-sized ? models among the United States . ' three largest Conti'med ott'paNe rid . I Car dealers riding a rocky road now // automobile manufacturers  --  General Motors , Ford ; and Chrysler . SOME DEALERS have been forced to sell their full-sized models at less than dealer cost . Consumer wariness has caused Americans to either delay the purchase of a new car or step down to a less prestigious but more fuel-efficient model . This buying tendency has caused a backlog of large cars and has hurt manufacturers and salesmen alike . General Motors has taken steps to combat this decline with an incentive program designed to help the dealer reduce his burdensome supply of luxury cars . GM provides the dealer with a sales quota and then gives him a rebate based on the percentage of the quota he meets . Some rebates have been as high as $700 a car . A GM spokesman said the program has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Sunday . But he added that dealers also were selling the cars at a much lower price . CIIICAGO-AREA dealers present a mixed picture , ranging from the guarded optimist to the pragmatist who must live with less income for the year . " A lot of dealers have a lot of big ears left and it 's getting close to invoice time ; so , they have to cut their price to near invoice costs , " said Clyde Matthews , a salesman at Warren Buick . " Some guys are even going below dealer cost to get the rebate . " To actually sell these cars , you ca n't make the profits you made 12 months ago . Personally , I find it discouraging and I 'm making less money . " 51ATTIIEWS SAID he Is 52,000 behind in income on commission compared to last year . " Now you really ca n't rely on traffic coaling through the door . You never really could , but it 's much worse , " Matthews said . " I 'm not desperate at this moment , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone 's indecisive , and they do n't know what 's going on . " This indecision , clouded by uncertainty , is the biggest factor in the decline in large car sales , several dealers agreed . " We 're running into problems now because everyone is seated , " said Mort Jacobs , sales manager at Humphrey Chevrolet in Evanston . " Gasoline has got them scared to death . " JACOBS SAID his sales are down 50 per cent from a year ago on full-size Column 1 cars . He said he has a 120-day supply of Caprices ; a 60-day supply is considered healthy . " I have to take whatever it takes to make a deal today , " Jacobs said . " The , floor traffic is very quiet and the salesmen are feeling the brunt of it . " In an effort to increase sales , dealers have begun heavy solicitation , both by phone and by direct mail to potential customers . The time salesmen , used to spend on the floor making sales is now spent on the phone trying to entice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we went into an intensive advertising campaign when the snow broke , " said James Reilly , new-car sales manager at Fanning Cadillac . " Then the gas allocation hurt us . The customer who buys a Cadillac will buy if-he knows the market is good or if he knows the market is bad ; but if he does n't know what 's going on , he 's not going to buy . " Of course , business is off . The market is slow and it 's weak , but it 's only because of uncertainty . " Each dealer interviewed said full-sized car sales were down for the year , and down significantly in the last three months . The declines ranged from 20 to 50 per cent for May through July . " WE ARE overstocked , but what hurts us is talk of rationing , " said Ralph Fletcher , sales manager for Holiday Lincoln Mercury in Evanston . " People who buy our cars never worry about the expense of gas . They worry about not being able to get it . " All automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is no way to compensate them . In the Chicago metropolitan area , they 're really in an eight-month drought . " However , the overall decline in the Chicago area appears to be less than that reported nationally . A Ford spokesman said LTD sales were down 39 per cent for July and 25 per cent for the year . Lincoln Mercury sales were down 57 per cent for July and 29 per cent overall , with an average 152-day supply for Continentals . A GM spokesman said Caprice sales were down 29.6 per cent for July and 23 pea cent for the year . The showrooms are lined with dream cars , but nobody wants to buy .
