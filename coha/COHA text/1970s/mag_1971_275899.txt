ONE of the highest priorities of the Nixon Administration has always been the search for what one of its officials calls " a decent exit " from Viet Nam . Washington had hoped that next month 's presidential election in that country would have provided such an avenue . A hard-fought campaign and honest balloting could have signified a long step toward open and competitive democracy , vindicating Nixon 's policy of Vietnamization and justifying a stepped-up U.S. withdrawal . But last week President Nguyen Van Thieu killed any lingering hopes for such a success . By ordering opponent Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky 's name off the ballot , he turned the election into an all but meaningless referendum on his own performance in office ( see THE WORLD ) . In Washington , Administration leaders were utterly dejected . " To say that we 're disappointed gets nowhere near the depth of it , " said one . " It 's a goddam mess and we ca n't see our way out . " <P> The election became a farce largely because Thieu would brook no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Duong Van Minh , who withdrew earlier , maneuvered coldly in pursuit of their private ambitions . Although self-seeking might well be considered a universal disease of politicians , the candidates ' actions , judged by Washington logic , made little sense . " It was in their interest , even more than in ours , to have this election go off well , " complained a frustrated U.S. diplomat . " We needed it , of course , to help justify our policies . But it is their country . They needed it even more . " That sentiment was echoed by a South Vietnamese official : " By using force , President Thieu can run alone . He will win , of course . But it will not solve the problems of our country . It will only make them worse . " <P> Coup Attempt . The U.S. had hoped that it would be obvious to the South Vietnamese that a fair and vigorously contested election would knock down Hanoi 's persistent charge that the Saigon government is a puppet of Washington . A willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have convinced Hanoi that the time had come to negotiate seriously for a peace settlement . But as Thieu reaches for greater power by grasping all available governmental levers , dissidence grows , the possibility of a military coup becomes more real , and Hanoi may be tempted to continue to stall . Saigon could even return to the chaotic days of revolving governments that followed the overthrow and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963 . And that would almost certainly shred any remnants of U.S. sympathy with the Viet Nam involvement .
