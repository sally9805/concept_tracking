txt To the Cook County Department of Public Aid , I am known as Case No. 04-228-336358 . As a newly enrolled public aid recipient , I was told I would receive $213.80 a month for myself and my two children whose father had abandoned them . Altho I am a TRIBUNE reporter , married and have no children , I succeeded in being added to the public aid rolls April 16 . I did so to test the substance of charges that such a feat is easy . The result of three hours of waiting and a 30-minute interview was a promise of emergency funding in nine days and a food check for $27.44 , which I received three days later . A Lesson In Cheating What transpired that day was a lesson in how to cheat the system . It took place at the public aid office at 4236 N. Lincoln Av. , where I became one of the one in 14 people in Illinois on welfare , as well as one of the uncounted others who cheat to get on . A disgruntled welfare caseworker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving welfare money before they find you 've cheated . They wo n't send a staff worker to check you out for weeks , or months . " The welfare system has gotten away from just helping those who need it ? the hard core unemployed . Our waiting rooms are now also being used by bored and unemployed middle class persons , who either lie about their situation or feel they deserve a better job and want the government to retrain them . " The Lincoln Avenue public aid office is on the second floor , past a foul-smelling stairwell . I arrived at 11 a. m. and was dressed in brown heels , brown skirt , neatly pressed blue shirt and a worn pea jacket . I wore no makeup . I had called ahead and said my situation was an emergency . I needed food . " Be here before 2 o'clock , " I was told . " We do n't fill food disbursal orders after that time . First come ? first served . " A receptionist took my name and those of my nonexistent children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told to wait . It had been raining and I sat next to a young woman who complained about her wet , blond hair and her pregnancy shots the day before . " Do you have any kids ? " she asked me . I nodded . " Well , I have a little girl . Her father left us over a year ago , which is fine with me , " she said as she patted her stomach . " I hope to get married soon to this baby 's daddy , whom I live with , and then we are*going to take a three-month vacation to Mexico . " I asked if she had tried getting a divorce . Waiting for Vacation " Well , " she said . " My caseworker keeps setting up appointments for me at the Legal Aid Bureau , but I 've canceled them all . Public aid gives us security , you know . " A sign on a wall read : " On behalf of the staff and myself , I would like you to know that we recognize public assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I can hardly wait to go on that vacation , " she repeated . I was getting nervous and wondered if I 'd remember all the names , dates and places that would eventually fill dozens of welfare forms . It was 1:30 p. m. and I was going to miss the 2 p. m. food check deadline . Then my name was called . I gave my true name and Social Security number to the man handling my application . He painstakingly quizzed me . He was n't going to be " one of those young people who would give the world away " as one caseworker had told me . My story ? I was from Prairie City , Ia. ; the mother of two preschool daughters ; my husband had deserted me ; and I had come to Chicago to find work last November . My mother had supported me until her recent illness . I could n't find work because I could n't get child care . I remembered what another caseworker had told me : " Welfare 's Golden Rule can be summed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care is not expected to work . " " What skills do you have ? " he asked . " None , " I said . " What do you want to do ? " " Be a writer , " I replied . " You know you are being a romanticist  --  have you ever thought of babysitting or waitress work ? " he asked . " No , " I retorted . " Do you want to find someone to take care of my kids ? " " Why do n't you go back to Iowa ? " he advised . " It takes a special ? kind of person to make it here , especially if she has two children , no skills , no money and a job in your mother 's shop is waiting for you . " I began to cry . " I know my chance will come . Someday , I 'll make it . If only I had enough nerve to sell my work . I 'm just afraid of failure . " I told him about the pregnant girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal , " he said . " The question is ? is it moral ? " " Now what is your landlord 's name and home phone number ? " he asked . I told him I did n't know , but volunteered a phone number where he could be reached that day . I had arranged for someone to answer his call . I was never asked for identification , which I was prepared to give . No phone calls were made to verify my family status and my home address . I was promised emergency funds immediately , altho it was too late to get a check for food . " I 've been waiting a long time , " I said . " Look at these forms , " he said . " I have many more to fill out before I can get this processed . You 'll have to wait until Monday . " My first thought was that he was going to check me out . All it would take was a few phone calls . I returned Monday for my food check . Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check . " Here is your public aid number , " I was told . The food check for $27.44 was later returned to David C. Daniel , director of the Cook County Department of Public Aid , and Michael Sneed 's name was stricken from the welfare rolls.
