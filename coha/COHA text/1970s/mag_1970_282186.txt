THE most remarkable aspect of this year 's college commencements is that so many are actually coming off . In the wake of Cambodia and Kent State , some observers predicted widespread commencement walkouts , to say nothing of possible riots . But in the past few weeks , students have channeled their anger and done on campus what they hope to do in politics : work within the system to bring about substantive change . On many campuses , student influence has produced unorthodox commencements-but commencements nonetheless . They have carried , for their participants , new and realistic symbolism , and in the main they have been orderly . A nationwide sampler : <P> Constructive Dissent . At Tufts University , the protest songs of Joan Baez and Phil Ochs filled the air as denim-shirted students passed out flowers and programs to 5,000 people at a Sunday afternoon " counter-commencement . " ( The formal degree-granting ceremony the day before had drawn only 25 of the 1,500 graduating seniors . ) New York Congressman Alard Lowenstein , a leading Democratic dove , spoke on the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bland passages from the Tufts catalogue and the names of the six Tufts graduates who have died in Viet Nam . There were memorial services for both the war dead and those of Kent State and Jackson State . <P> At the University of Massachusetts , ceremonies were simple and somber . Said Senior Class President David Veale : " If the war continues , many of the men in this class will be forced to kill or be killed . A joyous commencement is inappropriate . " M.I.T. President Howard Johnson will not give the traditional charge to the seniors because , as one official puts it , " the students do n't want him to .

Instead , $2,000 will go to a fund for wounded Vietnamese children and the American Friends Service Committee . Berkeley students have helped set up separate ceremonies for the university 's various departments and colleges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campus eucalyptus grove . Featured speakers : parents . <P> Not everyone is pleased with such goings-on . At American University , antiwar students wearing black robes and white masks with Oriental features unsettled the audience by wandering silently about , one of them solemnly shredding programs . Finally , a group of faculty and parents walked out when Guest Speaker Nicholas von Hoffman , inflammatory columnist of the Washington Post , launched a biting attack on President Nixon . <P> To be sure , commencement has remained pretty much the same at hundreds of colleges , especially in the Midwest and South . But few schools have remained altogether untouched by this spring 's emotional climate ; at many , caps and gowns are optional , and even where they are required , there is often a scattering of white armbands of protest . <P> Student influence is visible in the choice of many commencement speakers as well as their topics . Among the prominent choices : Harvard antiwar Biologist George Wald , Anthropologist Margaret Mead , former Attorney General Ramsey         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
