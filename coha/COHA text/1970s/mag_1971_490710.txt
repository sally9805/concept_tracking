THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment OVER the last few years , a false , simplified picture of American politics has been superimposed on the political realities . The rigid formulas and clichs that make up this false picture arc familiar  --  all too familiar ? - to everybody . We are speaking of that view which divides all Americans into two groups  --  the wild men who oppose government policies and the responsible people who support government policies . On the one hand , the young , long-haired , loud-mouthed , pot-smoking extremists ; on die other hand , the old , short-haired , reserved , cigar-smoking Establishmentarians . Abhie Hoffman versus 114a ) or Daley . Insofar as you oppose government policies , particularly in regard to Indo-China , you 're supposed to look and act like Ahhie Hoffman . Insofar as y on support government policies , you 're supposed to look and act like Mayor Dale ) . And so on and so on . One of the people who fit the clichs least well is Senator McGovern . Senator McGovern takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temperament  --  or " style , " as these things are called  --  are notable for their steadiness and calm . This combination of content and " style " throws many political observers into confusion , because , according to the accepted beliefs of the day , anyone who opposes the war as forcefully as Senator McGovern does is bound to be an inflatnmator ) , somewhat hysterical figure . Many commentators have run headlong onto the horns of this apparent dilemma . One of the most recent casualties was David S. Broder , of the Washington Post , who wrote an article called " The Aspirants ' Style , " in which he compared the " styles " cf Senator Muskie and Senator McGovern . Mr. Broder wrote that " McGovern 's instinct is to pounce on an issue ; Muskie 's is to ponder it . Muskie 's judgments seem more impressive , in part because they come rumbling up in that throbbing bass of his , while McGovern delivers his opinions in the voice of a tenor choirboy . But McGovern 's are a darn sight plainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity may be McGovern 's undoing .... The prevailing wisdom in the Democratic Party is that Muskie 's big-daddy moderation is more in keeping with the mood of the country than McGovern 's brash-sounding prairie radicalism . " But just a few sentences after referring to Senator McGovern as " brash-sounding , " Mr. Broder assures us that McGovern is n't " the soft , sweet , simple clergyman 's son he appears . " In fact , Mr. Broder goes on , " he has an instinct for Hit political jugular and a talent fur finding an issue . " In conclusion , Mr. Broder says , " Given Moskie 's hunkering caution , maybe it 's well he has a terrier-like McGovern at his heels . " What we seem to have here is a head-on collision of two cliches . On the one hand , because of his views , McGovern 's " style " is seen as " brash-soiinding " and " terrier-like . " On the other hand , because of his quiet hehaviiir , it is seen as appearing " soft , sweet , simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft , terrier-like , sweet , brash-sounding , simple tenor chuirhoy who represents the radical prairie state of South Dakota . Sailing Away WE went to the National Boat Show ' 71 , at the Coliseum , the other day . Although it was not our intention , we escaped from just about everything . We found lots of salesmen wearing navy-blue blazers with brass buttons , lots of pipe smokers , lots of short haircuts , lots of health , lots of indifference to the whole world . Nobody with sideburns . Nobody coughing . Nobody with the Hu . Nobody wearing hot pants . Nobody cranky . Nobody dirty . No cause buttons on people 's lapels , except a very pretty sky-blue one with a sail sketched in white on it and the words " FIGHT l'OU LTION. ! - ; Aif . " Knowing that there would he plenty of big stuff to contemplate , we started out modestly , with a new little sports sailboat  --  the AMF Alcoa Minifish ( only $397 ) . " Do n't get old in your hack yard ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the New York distributor of the Minifish , said to us . " Look at my complexion . My tan . " " Great , " we said . " I 've been sailing for fifty years , " Mr. Hill said . " I started when I was eleven . With a Toppan dory , a New England-style double-undid skiff . The sail was made of cotton . It would mildew when you put it away . This one is made of Dacron . You look as though you could use a good tan . " " You said it , " we said . " On Sunday 5 , I frostbite . That means I race in the winter , " Mr. Hill said . " I went out last Sunday at Darien in my Sunfish . It has a good helm . That means it feels stahle to sailors . It is n't tippy . It 's a fun thing . " " How does the Minifish compare with those little dinghies the kids sail in Norway we asked . " This is faster , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speed . Does n't it give you a feeling of speed Take a look . " " Sure does , " we said . " How many have you sold today ? " " Five this morning , " Mr. Hill said . " All five Minifish to a man named Inn Holm . From Sea Cliff , Long Island . He 'll use them in teaching young people to sail . He happens to he eighty-two years old , but he looks fifty . That 's what happens when you sail . " We headed for the stall of the magazine Sail , where we got a further boost in outlook from Donald Macaulay , another unfleshy man . On his lapel was another button , this one non-causeblack background , with the word " SAIL " in yellow letters and " is the only way to go " in white . Mr. Macaulay gave us one of his buttons . " This button thing has grown like Topsy , " he said to us . " A couple of years ago , our first button said ' Sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here ? " we asked . " Tell you what 's happening , " he said , very cheerfully . " This year , they 're coming here with checks . They 're putting deposits down . Last year , the idea was that better times are coming , the upswing is just around the corner . Remember what they were telling us in Washington a year ago ? How it was going to turn around ? " " Sure do , " we said . " Well , this year people came in with the attitude that they had been fooled , so they 're not waiting any longer , " Mr. Macaulay said . " They 're buying now . " We scooped up application blanks for credit cards offered by Gulf Oil , Mobil , and such at various other stalls , and got the dope on custom-made Porpoise Suits , of nylon-lined neoprene , with contoured high neck , protective neck and chest flap , corrosion-proof recessed zipper , and a lot of other features , for either $48.95 or $54.95 . We looked at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His and Hers apparel to match . Then , being in no rush , we stood around on the third floor of the Coliseum , on the balcony overlooking the second floor , where Bristol yachts and Chris-Craft and Trojan houseboats were on view . It was a fine sight . Nice , big , safe , comfortable boats with beds , bathrooms , galleys , closets , sofas , sun decks , and oyster crackers . We took our time . First , we studied a brochure given to us by officers of Caribbean Sailing Yachts , Ltd. , of Tenafly , entitled " Sail Away Without Delay . " It offered a yacht-chartering plan at a weekly winter-rate cost of $165 per person for four people , which covered rent of the yacht , food , fuel for the main engine , ice , linen , and taxi service to and from the airport in the Caribbean : " You can arrive at our marina site ( at Tortola ) and literally Sail Away Without Delay .... We provide everything : good food in variety and abundance and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is going to cost . All you need bring besides your clothes are toothpaste , toothbrush , shaving equipment , cigarettes . " The same outfit had another brochure , explaining another plan , which was called Sail ' N ' Save  --  a yacht-ownership plan whereby Caribbean Sailing Yachts , Ltd. , sells yachts to individuals and then leases them hack to use in its chartering , or Sail Away Without Delay , business . On our way to the big yachts , we paused to admire a Larson ski boat with bucket seats covered in vinyl-plastic leopardskin . Anthony Corrado , of the Shelter Cove Marina , was in charge of the exhibit . " This is a very flashy boat that teen-agers get their fathers to buy for them , because it only costs twenty-five hundred dollars and yet it attracts the girls , " Mr. Corrado told us . " Yes , " we said . " How 's business ? " " I sold six since yesterday , " Mr. Corrado said . " Where do you let people try it ? " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who know boats can tell by looking , " he said . " They do n't need to try it . Kids want speed , not comfort . They take one look and see die flash , ? the speed of it . For myself , I like a canvas top over my head . But kids do n't care if they get wet . Boat builders are now beginning to think about what the younger element goes for . " We next settled in on Chris-Craft 's new thirty-five-foot Commander Salon ( $55,440 ) . Gordon Houser , a healthy-looking Chris-Craft man up from Chris-Craft headquarters , at Pompano Beach , told us that the Commander was the only boat that had separate cabins fore and aft . " You never have to go through one to get to the other , " he said . " We like to say that this boat respects your privacy . " We looked it Over carefully . Master stateroom with a double bed , private lavatory , and stall shower . Galley with stainless-steel sink , electric refrigerator-freezer , three-burner electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nice fog bell . " We have a great gal , Myrtle Corhman , who does our interior structural design , " Mr. Houser said as we were hanging around on the boat . " In this boat , Myrtle has remembered the gals . The main stateroom even has a regular little vanity , with a lot of drawer space . " We left Mr. Houser and his **25;3940;TOOLONG Chris-Craft , and returned to the world of sideburns and the flu . ? OVERHEARL outside Blooming-dale 's , one Ali MacGraw to another ; " I hate the midi , I do n't need the midi , I do n't even want the midi , but I bought one . " Steven Paul WALTER KERR gave a talk at The Players the other day in which he said that it would he good for the theatre if more plays were written by actors ; he was able , of course , to cite such actor-playwrights as Shakespeare and Molire . One actor who anticipated Kerr and was already following in these illustrious foot-steps is Steven Paul , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s , first play , " Hap-py Birthday , Wanda June . " Mr. Paul is dis-tinguished not only for having written a play " Do you know what 's happening , Daddy ? It 's George Washington 's birthday , and we 're crossing the George Washington Bridge ! " ? but also for the fact that he is twelve years old . We recent ) met Mr. Paul backstage after a Sunday matini:jt , and went out to a delicatessen with him to talk ahout his life and his multifarious talents . Over a pair of turkey sandwiches on white , with mayonnaise , Mr. Paul told us that he was horn in May , 1958 , spent his first ten years in Queens , and then moved , with his family , to Westchester . He attended puha : schools from kindergarten throagh sixth grade ( " I know the names of all my teachers . You want to hear them ? " I , but now that his professional commitments are becoming more time-consuming , he is attending the Lincoln Square Academy , most of whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is in the sof enth grade . His family consists of his father , who is in the investment business , who drives bins home from the theatre every night , and who believes in giving whatever ability a child has the opportunity to develop without pushing it ; his mother , whom he describes with pride as " not a stage mother  --  she 's a ii AiSe mom , " a brother , Stuart , fifteen ( " an introvert , a good student , a terrific magician " ) ; and a sister , Bonnie , nine ( " She 's really very talented , but she loves to eat and she 's overweight , so she has n't done much yet with her talent " ) . He decided at the age of six that he wanted to get on TV and to be able to dance like Gene Kelly , and he started taking tap-dancing lessons . At eight , it decided dancing was n't enough , and began taking acting classes , too . Soon he was doing a little modelling and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American-looking " ? he has hazel eyes and blond hair , with fashionably long bangs  --  for many of today 's commercials , which , he says , feature " offbeat " kids . Two years ago , he acquired a manager , and his career got off the : ground . In 1969 , he was one of the young boys in a summer-stock production of " Oliver ! " ? an upward move that Cotit the Pauls a couple of thousand dollars , because Steven 's mother , sister , and brother went im the road with him , and his father flew to assorted cities up and down the East Coast to join the itinerant family on weekends . Then came parts in two short-lived Off Broadway plays ( " Lyle , " a musical , and " Lemon Sky , " a drama ) ; a number of TV appearances ( soap operas , a comedy show , two Sarnyan plays ) ; a movie ( " Pigeons " ) ; and " Happy Birthday , Wanda June , " in which Mr. Paul plays the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly from Africa , after an absence of eight years , to his wife , Penelope , and their twelve-year-old son , Paul , who have long believed him dead . During Harold Ryan 's absence , Penelope has been courted by two men her son considers " creeps " ? a " fairy doctor " and a hero-worshipping vacuum-cleaner salesman . " Harold Ryan is a legend to me , " his stage son said , explaining his role . " I 've looked up to hint all those years he was away , because I never really knew him . I compared everyone else unfavorably to him . When he comes hack , I start to see him for the mean man he is . It tells in some of my lines , like when I say to him , ' I do n't think you know anybody . You talk to everyone just the same . ' " We asked Mr. Paul what he thought of the three- , four- , five- , and seven-letter words that arc tossed around onstage . " I do n't really mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people are acting parts , so they do n't affect me , " he replied . " Those words are mainly words in a play . " Was it boring to do the same play over and over ? " No , because every night it seems like a different play . " How did his idea of death jibe with the Heaven depicted in " Happy Birthday , Wanda June , " which is populated by a large number of shuffleboard players , including a Nazi general , an alcoholic , and Jesus Christ ? " I do n't think there 'll be a separate Heaven or Hell , but I like the idea of another life , " he said . " Everyone would he there . I think if Jesus Christ turns out to he just another guy playing shuffleboard , that would he nice . I 'd like to be good chums with him . FM try to stay next to the most important peo plc . But the guy I 'd really like to get to know would he W. C. Fields . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol . The character I want to be is a sort of Gene Kelly-Elvis Presley-Jerry Lewis-W . C. Fields put together . Paul Newman is good , but he 's too serious . I 'd rather dance and sing . " Mr. Paul had nothing but praise for all the adults in the cast of " Happy Birthday , Wanda June " ( " In other plays , the attitude was standoffish  --  you know , ' Kid , do n't bother me ' ? but in this play the grownups have been great " ) ; for the play 's director , Michael Kane ( " Some of my other directors just yelled a lot and told me where to stand . They were n't directors , they were choreographers . Michael kept asking me how I 'd feel if those things in the play were happening to me , and he never raised his voice " ) ; and for the play and its author ( " I like Kurt 's sense of humor and how he places his words . You get the feeling that if you stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Which brought us to Mr. Paul 's play ? " The Pipsqueaks , " a musical comedy intended primarily for children . " I started to write it last October , during rehearsals , and I finished it around Christmastime , " the youngest actor-playwright on Broadway told us . " I like to stay up late , so I worked on it around three o'clock in the morning . It 's about a bunch of kids trying to become a successful musical group . Some kids join the group , some leave it , and they go around for auditions . In a way , you could say it 's partly about me and my whole family . There 's a character called Susie , who could he Bonnie . She thinks the group stinks and she 's the only good one in it . Most of the characters have a little hit of me in them . One character sings and dances . One likes girls . Peter , the star , has the most of me . He has a musical group , and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's determined to succeed , and he 's conceited . Hey , would you call me conceited ? You might ; you could . I 'm going to succeed . The theatre is pretty rough , but I like competition . I thrive on it . I like football and handball and clothes and school , except for science , but what I care most Arita is the theatre . All I really enjoy reading is scripts , and to me Clive Barnes is the Times . I want to write my own plays , write the music for them , act in them , and produce them . You wait and see . I 'm going to have twenty shows playing at once all the way from Miami to Canada . I 've always wanted to do everything . " Kurt Vonnegut , Jr. , has read " The Pipsqueaks , " thinks it should be tape d or filmed after it is polished a little , and agrees with its author 's self-appraisal . Mr. Vonnegut said recently , " Steven is so joyful in the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake , or at least William Blake 's little boy found . " Air ON one Air Unsat- isfactory clay , we got into a taxi and , hoping for some kind of refreshing breeze as it got going , opened a rear window . " Roll up that window ! " the driver said sternly . " I 'm burning incense up here in front . " Reigning Queens WE heard last week from a young friend of ours who is very jaded , and very tired of New York social life . Surprisingly , he issued us an invitation . " Come with me tomorrow , " he said . " The Royal Box of the Hotel Americana will provide a regal setting for a gala luncheon honoring two of America 's reigning beauties  --  the 1971 New York Summer Festival Queen , Samantha Ridge , and Anita Hannemann , the National Wine Queen , from California . It is the only social function of the winter season I have agreed to attend . " Impressed and somewhat intimidated by our friend 's gravity and by the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day for the Americana . We met our young friend , who was surveying the Royal Box . " All red , " he was saying . " Red is such a regal color , do n't you think ? Or do n't you ? Now , the cti'ing is n't red . The ceiling is gray and looks like papier-macho , which detracts from the sumptuous atmosphere , but we 'll try not to notice . The important thing is to pay attention to the reigning queens . " The reigning queens were standing behind an enormous cheesecake , posing for photographers . Embedded in the cheesecake were a small model of the Empire State Building ( representing New York ) and a bottle of California champagne ( representing California ) . The model of the Empire State Building was slowly sinking into the cheesecake . The New York Summer Festival Queen rescued the model of the Empire State Building . " Queen Anita is here to celebrate record American wine consumption , " said a lady connected with the wine industry . " Enthusiasm for wine drinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , they now sell wine in grocery stores . We get frantic phone calls from Maine , because they do n't know what to do with their wine now that they have it . That 's where Queen Anita comes in . Is n't that fabulous ? We had camera crews that were coming , but the Young Lords were having a sit-in , and they had to cover that first . " There was lunch , and a great many tired-looking people from the press sat around a formally laid table and talked to one another and paid very little attention to either of the reigning queens . A pianist played a song called " I Always Suit the lArine to the Occasion , " which he said would be sung in a soonto-he-produced revue . Then a man connected with the wine industry proposed a toast to the two reigning queens . A photographer who had come late asked for some pictures , and the two queens left their lunch and went back to pose by the cheesecake with the Empire State Building and the champagne . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " the photographer said , motioning . Queen Samantha moved in front of the cheesecake . " No , behind it , " said the photographer . " Pm sorry , " said Queen Samantha . Meanwhile , at the press table , an indignant man told a story in a very loud voice about a woman of his acquaintance who was studying for her Ph.D . but could n't spell . " What she has is a memory , " the man said . " She 'll quote you sentences  --  paragraphs . She 's got a memory . " Shortly after lunch , there was an official presentation of roses to the California Wine Queen by the New York Summer Festival Queen . Every guest had been given a transcript of this presentation . The transcript was complete . This is a sample of how it went : PRESENTATION CEREMONY ( Girls approach the microphone from opposite sides of the stage in Royal Box . Someone hands roses to Queen Samantha . ) SAMANTHA : Thank you . ( Queen Samantha turns to Queen Anita . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome you to New York City .... Please accept these roses on behalf of Mayor Lindsay and all the people of New York City . ( Queen Samantha hands flowers to Queen Anita . ) ANITA : Thank you , Queen Samantha . Our friend was pleased with the transcript . " It is these small , considerate touches that give an event like this tone , " he said .
