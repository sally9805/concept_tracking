Roy Swartout and Edward Compere of El Monte , Calif , about a real illness , ischiogluteal bursitis . The ailment results when friction causes inflammation of the bursae , or small , fluid-filled sacs , in places where tendons pass over the ischia , or hipbones .

The team bases its report on a study of 51 young men and women who used marijuana regularly . Taking T-lymphocytes , or immunologically active white blood cells , from the pot smokers and from 81 healthy , nonsmoking volunteers , the doctors mixed the cells in test tubes with substances known to elicit immune responses . Cells from both groups responded to the foreign substances by multiplying , but those taken from the marijuana users reproduced 40% less than those from controls , a result suggesting that regular marijuana users may be more susceptible to disease . <P> &gt; Doctors have long suspected that industrial exposure to vinyl chloride , a plastic substance , is dangerous .

Last week the cancer was discovered in two more of the employees and confirmed as a contributing cause of death in an employee of a West Virginia plant . Although the action comes too late to save the workers who have already contracted the disease ( six have died of it ) , the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board has taken steps to reduce the risk to other workers by lowering allowable levels of exposure to vinyl chloride in the plant .
