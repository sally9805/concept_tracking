THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE were driving along the Bruckner Expressway on a mean , blustery morning , listening on the radio to 1 terrible news of what people were doing to one another everywhere , and looking through a pale snowfall at the grinding ugliness of the South Bronx  --  the desperate , pathetic stores ; the vast , sullen apartment buildings and as the snow turned to icy rain and the windshield wipers whined their melancholy verse ( relentless , monotonous /relentless , monotonous ) , and the traffic slowed to that pace of suppressed frenzy in which every car is locked into an intimate but impersonal ( and potentially savage ) relationship with its neighbors , and the immediate prospect was for even slower traffic ahead and for more time to study the surrounding detritus of our society  --  well , we said the hell with it , took the first exit we found ( White Plains Road , as it happened ) , and headed for the shore . Our idea was to keep going until we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whichever came first . White Plains Road joined Sound View Avenue after a while , and the area turned rather rural . The rain stopped . There were open lots and trees , and then we saw water ahead . The Bronx came to a halt in a small parking lot , empty except for a couple of rows of neatly parked abandoned cars . On the left was the Shorehaven Beach Club , an enclave surrounded by a high chain-link fence with barbed wire on top ( hardly inviting ) ; straight ahead was open water ( The Sound ? An arm of the East River ? Anyway , cold and gray ) ; but on the tight we caught a glimpse of something arresting , and that was the direction we took . What we saw was bungalows , lots of them , sitting shoulder to shoulder under tall trees , making a quilt of colors  --  chocolate , rose pink , lime green , lavender , tan  --  like a town in the background of a fifteenth-century fresco . We drove down a very narrow , deeply rutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . The bungalows were one story high and one room in width ; otherwise , they had nothing in common structurally . They were built of every conceivable material  --  though many featured Early Tarpaper  --  and the range of textures and hues , even on a single bungalow , was astonishing and delightful . Every building extruded a number of small additions : room extensions , porches , sheds , garages , doghouses , verandas , stoops , overhangs . The bungalows leaned this way and that ; there was n't a straight line in sight . Chimneys tilted out of sagging roofs , walls angled down into the slush , fallen shingles rested like confetti on the snow , and a number of houses seemed to he making a jaunty last stand before descending vertically into the earth itself . Torn plastic storm windows fluttered in the wind . Cars , many of them old , were parked here and there , and dogs roamed in small social units . There were no people in sight , but the place did not feel deserted or desolate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty yards away . Here a resident of the first row of houses , standing on his doorstep , would have a superb view : from left to right , the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge ; College Point , in Queens ; LaGuardia Airport ; Rikers Island ; Hunts Point ; and , way off to the south , some Manhattan skyline . The immediate shore was meadow and mud , set off by several abandoned cars ( one yellow , wheelless , and upside down ) , a blue rowboat , some old breakwaters , and a harum-scarum pier . The beach was oily and dark , littered with the familiar tires , planks , and oil drums , yet the general prospect , having such an abundance of open water and such a sweep of empty sky , was extremely pleasing . Suddenly , a DC-l0 shrieked low overhead , pointing toward LaGuardia . " National , " it said on its tail , and there was a painted chow sun , suggesting warm , brightly lit Florida ; presumably , the plane was beating a load of toasted New Yorkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , descending , and when it seemed about to merge with the sea , it touched a distant runway , kicking up a cloud of white . We turned inland , down one of many humpy alleyways , past a brilliant blaze of laundry flapping on a backyard clothesline , past a lofty tree house of bleached wood . Every bungalow had a tiny yard ; every yard had a fence ( slats or picket or wire or something ) ; every fence had a gate . In season , the yards would he shady and green : there were trees and plants and shrubs of all kinds  --  lilacs and dogwoods and apple trees , flower beds and hedges , rosebushes and honeysuckle , wisteria and trellised ivy , twisting grapevines on pale arbors . Brick-lined paths and narrow concrete sidewalks led from doors to cookout chimneys , winding past lawn ornaments and toys and wheelbarrows half loaded with snow . There were tables for picnics , one yard had nine chairs of various kinds and three stepladders . Driving into an open area  --  a sort of square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elderly matt trudging through the slush . He was wearing work boots , a cap , and a heavy coat with a furry collar , and he was carrying a paper bag just large enough to hold a sandwich . He looked agreeable , so we hailed him . " Where are we ? " we asked . " Harding Park , " he said . We said we liked it . " We have our own volunteer fire department , " he said . " This used to be a summer place in the old days . They had tents . " We asked how long he had lived in Harding Park . " I 've stood it seventeen years , " he said . " You should see it in the summer , when all the trees are out .... Well , I got to go , " he added , and he did . Down an alley , a second man , also bundled up , with a blue wool cap pulled down over his cars , was lashing a group of garbage cans together with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was pink-cheeked and hardy-looking ; he might have been seventy . He told us that his name was Howard Bellingham , and that he had lived here since 1956 . " You ca n't heat it in the summertime ! " he shouted as another jet screamed over the treetops . " No one owns their property here , " he said when it was quiet again . " We all rent , and the owner always wants to throw us out so he can build high-rises . But we 're trying to buy the land ourselves . We went to planning-board meetings and finally got the area down-zoned , and that knocked the hell out of the high-rise plans . That and the jet planes . I remember one time a big builder was standing over there explaining his plans to some potential investors , and a jet went over , making a terrible noise . ' He 's kind of low , ' said the builder . Oh , no , ' ? ? said one of our people . He 's kind of high . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said goodbye . Driving away , we came to an intersection that had street signs , and found we were on Leland Avenue . We turned right ( onto Gildersleeve Avenue ) , and we seemed to be at the northern limits of Harding Park . To the left was an open field , and on the right was a small firehouse with red doors and a sign saying " Aviation Vol . Fire Dept . No. 3 . " As we slowed down to look at a couple of handsome old fire engines that had apparently been put out to pasture in an adjacent yard , a car pulled up and a young man jumped out and unlocked the door to the firehouse . We stopped , said hello , and asked him why the firehouse was called Aviation . " There used to be a small airfield across the road there , " he said , and he invited us in . " I 'm ex-Chief Ed Pache , " he added , shaking hands . " Between my father , my brother , and me , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always lived in Harding Park . " Pache showed us Aviation 's current fire engine ( " It 's a 1951 Ward LaFrance pumper , and it carries five hundred and fifty gallons " ) and two ambulances . We looked at a display of framed photographs on one wall , there was a splendid color snapshot of Pache 's late father , Chief John Pache , Sr. , at a 1965 firemen 's tournament on Long Island . The Chief was wearing a red shirt and a nice smile ; in one hand he held a bottle of beer and in the other hand the traditional chief 's speaking horn . It was a touching picture : he looked like a good man having a well-deserved good time . " My parents moved to Harding Park from Staten Island in the early nineteen-twenties , " said Pache . " In those days , there was a trolley line and a big amusement park . But that all went in the twenties . I was born at 1319 Harding Park . I 'm thirty-two now , but what you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid . It has n't developed any . Everybody was like one big family . Even today , it 's very close . " We asked Pache if he ever thought of living someplace else . He seemed surprised . " No , " he said . " Where else could I find a place like this ? " Gumbo -G UMBO " is the old word for the kind of track out at Aqueduct on Opening Day last week . Sloppier than slop . But fast , because , in an effort to speed up the sport on a wet track , the surface at the Big A has been made shallower and sandier and more porous than it was fifteen years ago , when taking mud grabbed at straining hoofs . It rained hard all night before Opening Day , and it had rained the previous morning . It had stopped raining by the time we reached the dockers ' booth , fifteen feet above the training track , at nearby Belmont Park , at eight-fortyfive Opening Day morning , but it would rain again soon . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve horses on the track , a few running hard , their slickered riders standing tall in the stirrups . Three men with stopwatches in the booth , a couple of jockeys ' agents , a couple of trainers , and a lot of cigars . The agents and the trainers traded gibes by way of welcoming each other hack to town . " A trainer has the easiest job on the track , next to a hot-walker , " said Lennie Goodman , who is the agent for Braulio Baeza , the ace Panamanian jock  --  the man who sits in the irons , according to Red Smith , like a Mayan or Toltec graven image . " I knew an agent who went on a diet , gave up smoking , and stopped drinking on the same day , " Johnny Campo said . Johnny Campo is a big , jolly trainer , who wears a Washington Redskins stocking cap . His horse , a filly named Riskalot , was running in the third . " That agent was the most nervous guy I ever saw . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to ease the tension. ? He must have done something . Kill habies ? " " Naw , " said Campo . " You just never saw a guy chew so much gum . " " Come next June , " said another clocker , " my future brother-in-law 's niece will be on the track . " Behind the dockers ' booth , three dogs had a squirrel up a tree . Steam rose from straw that grooms were re. - moving from the stables , and a Long Island Rail Road train hooted in the distance . We hit the Big A. Two and a half hours to post time . The first subwat loads of horseplayers were arriving on the seventv - five- cent special  --  round , trip fare and grandstand admission compris . The New York Racing Associ.ttion tracks have lost money in eight of the last nine years , Attendance has been off twenty-file per cent since Jon , : of 1971 , when Off-Track Betting began taking bets on the N.Y.R.

During the past two seasons , the N.Y.R.A. has tried two sixh-the-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The N.Y.R.A. , which operates the tracks , gave up one pci cent of its take and induced the state , which regulates the hacks , to forgo two per cent of its take , thus reducing the total takeout from each handle from **25;4989;TOOLONG per cent to fourteen-point-something per cent . The results last y ear encouraged the N.Y.R.A. : attendance dropped two and seven-tenths per cent on the season , but the handle was up by one and one-tenth per cent the first increase since ' 71 . It remains to be seen whether the Legislature will be impressed . The state gets from severity to eighty million dollars a year in revenue from the tracks without contributing a nickel in capital expenditure . Up in the press box , we found only the Squirrel , the man who runs the place , and Henry the Horse , a self-employed handicapper who once managed a bungalow colony up in the mountains . " I 'm not here to enjoy myself , " said Henry , who dresses his big frame in muted gray-and-white stripings . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was thirty years ago , what with the state taking such a cut of the handle . Now , say you got a poker game with eight players , and they each put a thousand in the pot . Right . And the house is going to keep eighteen per cent  --  because that 's what it amounts to  --  of each pot . And lees say it takes about a minute and a half to two minutes to play a hand . Right That 's reasonable . Now , you can scientifically prove through mathematics that in one hour and forty minutes the house is going to have eight thousand dollars and the winners and the losers inc going to have nothing apiece . Add this new gimmick betting to it , like exactas and trifectas , where the takeout is up to twenty-five per cent , arid you 'll i-nbabli wind up in the hole . Listen , have a good day . " Had steak-and-eggs in the Man o ' War Room with the turf-writers . Red Smith and Toney Betts , late of the Mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swapped horse stories by way of welcoming each other back . They both tried to remember the best lead ever written by W. J. Macbeth , the famous : Crib scribe , who died in the late thirties . Betts won .

He could have carried William Howard Taft ' Listen , Base a gond day . " Back at the track , the No. 1 ' wise-Joanne 's Fling , Angel Cordero , Jr .. up who was the favorite in the first race , broke fast , had the lead at mid-way by a head , and pulled ahead to win by two lengths ( $4.80 , $3.40 , $2.80 ) .

This made Ellie FitzSimons , the cute P.R . gal for the track , who had a 1-I Dail ) Double ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we encountered all afternoon . Cordero then won the third on Call the Queen , heating Johnny- Campo 's Riskalot end her reinsman , George Martens . George is sixteen , a high-school senior in nearby Floral Park , and he told us he won his first race in January , at the new Keystone track , northeast of Philly . George said Riskalot , who finished fourth , had slipped under the reins on the far turn , breaking out and losing the rail position . She had n't been able to change leads in the slop . George made fifty-four bucks for riding in the race . Henry the Horse , who was keeping careful book on each race but was not betting , gave us a tip on Champagne Charlie in the second division of the sixfurlong Patimonok Handicap , the first stakes race of the **29;5016;TOOLONG season .

Tytus Casella and Nile Delta dead-heated for the place slot . Champagne Charlie broke near last , finished last . Under a Montresor Moon THE New York City Opera is celebrating its thirty-first birthday with a brilliant new production of Puccini 's " Turandot , " an operatic fairy talc about a ferocious Chinese princess who decapitates her unsuccessful suitors . For a company the size of the City Opera , " Turandot " is a major challenge , because it requires elaborate sets and costumes , a large orchestra and chorus , a stentorian tenor , and a hefty-voiced soprano ( Turandot 1 who can belt out a series of high C 's as she walks up and down a flight of steps . The " Turandot " second-act staircase is a celebrated operatic trap . Birgit Nilsson , the most famous exponent of the role , tempts fate by running up and down the stairs in comfortably loose sandals ; less secure ladies have been known to settle for sneakers . Backstage at the dress rehearsal , we asked Rachel Mathes , the new City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she replied , " Gingerly . " Miss Mathes , a statuesque Southern woman , who was dressed in a glittering Chinese court costume of gold , green , and orange , extended a foot in a silver-and-gold ballet slipper . " This is the safest thing to wear , " she told us , in an Alabama drawl , " because the sole is thin enough to feel the edge of each step . One night , when I was singing ' Turandot ' in Augsburg , I came down a flight of steps that was so warped and uneven I nearly fell on my face . The trouble is , when you play an arrogant Chinese princess you stand there singing with a two-foot tiara on your head and three-inch nails on your fingers and you ca n't look down . " We walked through a hall , past a sign that said " Please Do Not Vocalize in the Corridors During Performances , " and out into the auditorium , where we found Julius Rudel , the City Opera 's director and conductor , rehearsing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's start from the last scream and get into position For the moon , " said Mr. Rudd , a handsome , gray-haired maestro , who keeps things moving in a firm but cheerful manner . " Renu-mber , chorus , you go from bloodthirsty violence  --  you want to see the Prince of Persia 's head cut off  --  to sensuous longing when the moon rises . Ladies , please -- more mystery on ' nada la Loa . ' You sounded like a bunch of disappointed children . Think of yourselves as adults , with hot blood rising in your veins . " Mr. Rudel started the orchestra with a sweeping downbeat and watched while the chorus  --  dressed as Peking peasants spaced itself across the stage and fell fiat on the floor . " Much better , " he said as the peasants rose slowly to their feet , singing with full-throated intensity . A funeral procession of guards in red and gold carried off the Prince of Persia to his death as Ping , Pang , and Pong , the Imperial Ministers , appeared in glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Turandot . " Don Abrams ) " called Mr. Rudel , freezing the action onstage for a moment . " Have we got a new gong for the Prince ? " " We do , Julius , " replied a disembodied voice , " but it has to be built in . " " O.K. , " said Mr. Rudd . " I 'll try it later . " At the end of the act , Mr. Rudel walked onstage to inspect a large circular gong that was being fitted into a pagoda-shaped frame . " The other one was tinny , " he said , seizing a mallet and striking the gong with an upward circular movement . " This has more character . " As stagehands unfolded a spangled staircase , we asked Mr. Rudel why he had chosen such a complicated work for the City Opera 's anniversary . " Turandot ' is total musical theatre , and that happens to be snmething that we , as a company , are particularly good at , " he said . " And the opera has many associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest affair  --  was the first opera I conducted after I became the company 's director , in 1957 . The present production , which is designed by Beni Montresor , comes from the Teatro La Fenice , in Venice . I conducted six performances of Turandot ' there in 1969 , and I liked the designs so much that f made the management an offer they could n't refuse for the sets and costumes . " " How does it feel to celebrate thirty-one years of the City Opera ? " we asked . " Vie arc not what we were , " said Mr. Rudd . " At the beginning , we were a shoestring operation that sometimes produced marvellous things under very difficult conditions . Everybody was kind but a bit patronizing Now that we can compete with the major opera companies of the world , our critics constantly call upon us to do better . Which is as it should he . The essence of our style is opera as drama . We are always looking for new dramatic techniques , new viewpoints that will enhance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to an audience . " " What do you remember as your worst moments as an opera conductor ? " we asked . " There was a Butterfly who came to the footlights during her first aria and said , ' Maestro , I 'm sorry , ' " Mr. Rude ) replied . " That was my first performance of the opera , and I wanted to hide . She stopped singing , but we continued somehow . Then there was a Rosenkavaliee when the first flute was delayed by a highway accident , so I had to whistle his part in the prologue . To my amazement , nobody noticed . But my all-time favorite was the chicken that got loose and fell into the orchestra pit during the first act of ' Manta ' By the : time we cornered it behind a harp , the singers bad broken up and the musicians were hysterical . Whenever something like that happens , I think of my favorite Rilke quote : ' Who talks of victory ? Survival is the essence .

The great comedian set his brother up in this business , and he likes to hit novelty trade shows whenever he can , looking for new items that Lester can add to his line . So last week Henny and a crony , MiIt Moss ( he 's the man who sat on the bed in the Alka-Seltzer commercial and said , " I ca n't believe I ate the who-o-o-ole thing ! " ) , took in the Variety Merchandise Show at the Coliseum and picked up free samples . We went along to carry the samples . Milt Moss does a put-on act with great success . The other day , he appeared before fifteen hundred people at a Standard Oil do at Lake Tahoe .

" Very fine company , very good , very respected " I 'd like everybody to meet Meg Plunkett , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jack Plunkeit. " people . Cheer , but nice . " Then he went into his stand-up routine . Milt Moss also appears as a Puerto Rii:an police chief , a Chilean tend-lease official , and the Deputy Finance Minister of France . Never a Minister or an Ambassador  --  always the Deputy . That way , it 's completely believable . " I wait until they 're all hooked . Then look for the hook to break it . Just like Henny taught me . " " He 's really happy with this diddle , " said Henny. " rust do n't let it go on too Iong . " " No , no , " said Milt .

Milt Moss put the sponge mop through Fenny 's lapel .

He gave one of the sets to us , to keep . LVe have played with it , and the only possible way you can win at Dartball is by throwing like a girl . Otherwise , the Velcro ca n't grab . We asked Henny why he did n't buy a Personality Dollar Bill . " Mai money 's tied up in cash , " he said . Henny talked to the concessionaires . " How 's the action ? What 's your hit item ?
