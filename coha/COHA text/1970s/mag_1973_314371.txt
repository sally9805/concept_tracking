For Richard Nixon , the lull in the Watergate tempest is over . This week Senator Sam Ervin 's committee reopens its public hearings , and by next week the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington will rule on whether the President must surrender his secret Watergate tapes to a federal grand jury . In addition , more indictments are expected shortly in connection with both the Watergate break-in and the burglary at the office of the psychiatrist of Pentagon Papers Defendant Daniel Ellsberg . Said one presidential adviser : " It 's like sitting here waiting for 24,000 volts . You know it 's coming , but you do n't know when . " <P> The most immediate source of difficulty for Nixon is the courts . Two weeks ago , the appeals court recommended that the White House and Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox seek a settlement in their fight over nine tape recordings of presidential conversations about Watergate . Despite three meetings totaling eight hours last week , the lawyers could not reach an agreement . TIME has learned that Nixon was willing to give Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President expects that a court decision might go against him , but continued to refuse to let the special prosecutor listen to the tapes themselves . <P> At first Presidential Counsel J. Fred Buzhardt offered Cox only written summaries of the tapes . They would contain brief snatches of direct quotes , but for the most part be limited to compilations by White House staffers of the substance of the conversations . Cox refused and , in turn , offered to excise profanity and other irrelevant material from any tape he listened to and decided should be sent to the grand jury . <P> Next Buzhardt offered Cox transcripts with portions not relevant to the Watergate investigation deleted by the White House . Again Cox refused , insisting that he or , at the very least , someone not employed by the Chief Executive be permitted to double-check the transcripts against the tapes . Finally both sides told the court that no out-of-court settlement was possible . <P> That set the stage for a court ruling either this week or next . It is expected to be in Cox 's favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reconvenes Oct. 1 . Since that court will not reach a decision before hearing oral arguments , Cox is considering taking the unusual step of asking Congress for a special act to extend the 18-month life of his grand jury . It is scheduled to expire Dec. 4 , but he wants to keep it in session until after the tapes battle has ended and all Watergate indictments have been voted on . <P> No Immunity . In reopening its public hearings , the Senate Watergate committee will first take testimony from convicted Conspirator E. Howard Hunt Jr. , followed during the week by Presidential Aide Patrick Buchanan , former White House Investigator John Caulfield and John J. Ragan , a bugging expert from Massapequa , N.Y . Caulfield testified for two days in May on his role in the offering of Executive clemency to Conspirator James McCord Jr . This week the committee planned to question both him and Ragan about the bugging , on orders from the White House , of Columnist Joseph Kraft 's telephone in 1969 . It intended to query Buchanan about his 1972 memos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muskie and others .
