Richardson , a Fort Worth oil millionaire , to become Secretary of the Navy in 1961 . The Connally testimony , responding to an article in the Monday editions of The New York Times , satisfied the committee , which approved the nomination , 11 to 0 , in a brief executive session . Two of the committee members attending the session did not vote . Two Senators not present for the executive session  --  Vance Hartke , Democrat of Indiana , and Abraham A. Ribicoff . Democrat of Connecticut ? asked to be recorded in favor of the nomination , bringing the committee Margin to 13 to 0 .

" Replying to what he described as the " innuendos " in the Times article ; Mr. Connally explained that the payments from the Richardson Founda- ; tion were for services he had : performed as co-executor of the Richardson estate before becoming Governor , " The moneysa received were vested long before I announced for Gm ernor.

Before and after Mr. Connally testified , committee members criticized The New York Times for printing what Senator Bennett . . described as " vague , unwarranted charges and inuendos . " ? Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana , the committee chairman , began the hearing by observing that The Times article had " sought to infer something improper about the payments . ' After the testimony , Senator Long said , " Those people on The Times owe you more of an explanation than , you owe them . " , Senator Robert P. Griffin a 1Michigan , the assistant Republican leader , told Mr. Connally : " If this is ' all there is to it , The New York Times owes you Ian apology . " ' Problem of Ethics ' Contending that The Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to mislead many people , " Senator Griffin told Mr. Connally : " The ( problem of ethics here lies with ; the The New York Times rather than with you . " Senator Clifford P. Hansen expressed " dismay and disilluIsionment with the behavior of a ; very important newspaper in ; this country . " " I think it ' should not go un ; noted , " the Wyoming Republilean said , " that it was known.to , a great many people that the Governor made a full disclosure of his relationship with . the Richardson ' estate . at the time of his hearings prior to his confirmation as Secretary . of the Navy " but that The Tithes " chose not to mention that fact at all , as nearly as I know , " Mr. Connally reacted to the Times report with a mixture of indignation and jocularity . At a gathering of Texans . last night , he was reported to have threatened to return to Texas if that was the way he was going to be treated . by the " Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again today before the committee , he welcomed the attention that he was obviously going to get from thes. press as Secretary of the Treasury . Attired in a tailored , doublebreasted , pin-stripe suit , Mr. Connally described how he discovered when Mr. Richardson 's will was read that he had been named an executor of the estate along with Perry R. Bass , ' Mr Richardson 's nephew , and Howell E. Smith , Mr. Richard ? son 's brother-in-law . The estate totaled $105 - million , and under Texas law the execu ? tors were entitled to up to 5 per cent of the estate in fees , Mr. Connally said . The estate was filed with the probate court in December , 1960 , and finally settled , with the aid of a $30-million loan to pay estate taxes , in January , 1962 . " This is probably the largest estate in ' the history of the United States ever wound up in so short a period of time , " Mr. Connally observed , remarking that the executors had " labored night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . Mr. Connally said his share of the executors ' fees would The NeWYerk Times Senator Fred R. Harris objected ' to immediate vote because copy of fee accord was not given . have amounted to about $1.2-million . But in January , 1961 , President-elect Kennedy offered him the post of Secretary of the Navy . He said he had had some " misgivings " about taking the Navy post in view of the " substantial " . executor fees to which he was entitled if he continued working on the estate . He decided to accept the appointment , he said , after reaching an agreement with the other executors that he would be paid a maximum fee of $750,000 , " provided it could be paid over a number of years . " Saying that he had forgone $400,000 to $500,000 in " certain fees , " in order- " to serve my country , " Mr. Connally added : " I have never said this before , because I do not think I am entitled to any plaudits or ' applause for it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ought to be pilloried for it . " Under the agreement , as described by Mr. Connally , the payments were.to ' run over an indefinite number of years , with the provision that no more than , 15 per cent could be paid ! in any one year . The payments , he testified , were made over an 11-year period , with the ' final payment in January , 1969 . In the early years , he said , the payments were not made in " regular amounts . " In the final six or seven years , he received $75,000 annually , he said . Mr. Connally noted that he told the Senate Armed-Services Committee in January , 1961 , during his confirmation hearings as Secretary of Navy , that he would not receive any fees from the Richardson estate while he was in " Government . service . " He explained today that " obviously I was talking about being Secretary of the Navy .

The payments were apparently resumed in 1962 , a year before Mr. Connally became Governor , and then continued until January , 1969 . The only mildly critical questioning at the hearing came from Senator Harris . Under questioning by Sena-I tor Harris , Mr. Connally was initially vague on when the agreement for deferred payments was entered into and on whether or not the agreement had been in writing . He finally said he thought the agreement was entered into after his Jan. 18 , 1961 , testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee . He also said he thought the agreement had been made in writing and promised to furnish a copy to the committee " if I. can rind it . " Senator Harris replied , " 1 would think something that important could be found . " The Harris line of questioning was designed to establish whether or not the deferred compensation agreement conformed to the Federal tax laws . The Senator 's interpretation of the tax laws was that for such a deferred payment to be valid , there had to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that the payments had to cover services not yet completed at the time of the deferral agreement . As Senator Harris pressed this line of questioning , Mr. Connally replied : " I do not want to comment on that in detail . But I thought we had excellent tax advice , and no question has been raised in the intervening 10 years . " Tax Return Audited Later he observed that at his request his tax return was ' audited by the Internal Revenue Service in 1969 . After the hearing , Senators Long and Bennett said the Connally deferred payment plan fell within the provisions of the tax laws . The two senior members of the committee said it was " not an unaccustomed procedure " for the tax service to let large fees be paid over a period of time to reduce income taxes . Mr. Connally said that after January , 1961 , he " did not per , form any work of consequence " on the Richardson estate . He remained as co-executor of the estate , signing some legal documents and conveyances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be sufficient to meet the condition for deferred payment plans that some of the payments must be for services not yet completed . Under questioning by Senator Long , Mr. Connally said he had not attempted to conceal his relationship with the Richardson Foundation or the fact that he was receiving payments from the foundation while Governor . ' Did Not Brag ' " I did not go around and brag about " the relationship with Mr. Richardson , he said , adding : " Everyone in Texas knew I was co-executor of the estate . " " I did not go around and tell the press all they wanted to know about my financial relationships , " he said . Mr. Connally was asked if he , through his press secretary , in 1964 informed The Texas Observer , a liberal biweekly magazine , that he had " performed no services or received no compensation " from the Richardson Foundation while Governor .
