txt Representative Wilbur D. Mills denounced today President Nixon 's proposal for unrestricted revenue sharing and proposed alternative approaches to meeting the needs of states and cities for more money to finance essential public services . Mr. Mills said that the President 's plan was " defective " primarily because it would not necessarily channel the money to the areas of greatest need . Unrestricted revenue sharing would also eliminate restraints on increases in spending by state and local governments , thus threatening to cause inflation and higher Federal taxes to finance the local outlays , he said . In addition , he said , revenue sharing would be impossible to turn off once started . Revenue sharing was also criticized by Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana , the Senate Democratic leader , who said tonight in a televised address that it might be a " dangerous procedure " to give money to states " without any quid pro quo . " Details on Page 20 . Speech on House Floor Mr. Mills , the Arkansas Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack in a speech on the House floor . The speech , was unusually long  --  just over an hour  --  and also unusually well attended , considering it was not part of any immediate legislative debate . A number of Representatives , . most of them I iberal Democrats , expressed agreement with Mr. Mills 's opposition to the plan . Mr. Mills is generally regarded as a moderate conservative . Mr. Mills has said that he will hold hearings on the revenue-sharing plan but that he hopes to kill it . A number of possible alternatives to revenue sharing would help states and cities deal with a shortage of funds to finance public needs , Mr. Mills said . He suggested alternatives that would do the following : Let the Federal Government help the states collect their taxes , with the states adopting laws setting their income taxes as a ' percentage of the Federal tax  --  the percentage to be decided by each state . The taxpayer would pay both taxes at the same time and the Federal Government would bear the administrative costs of the system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax returns for state income taxes paid , thus making it less difficult for states to raise their taxes . ( illeview the sprawling system of single-purpose grants by the Federal Government to states and localities and consolidate some of them into broader " block grant " programs . IlIncrease the share that is paid by the Federal Government under some of the current grant-in-aid programs . " Actually , if we are to reconsider the grant-in-aid programs in the areas of education , welfare , hospitals and health , we would be dealing with areas which account for nearly 60 per cent of the state and local government expenditures , " Mr. Mills said . ' Changing Formulas ' " Certainly changing formulas so that the Federal share is increased somewhat in the case of programs of this type would do as much , if not more , than developing a new Federal revenue-sharing program to be superimposed on top of the existing grant-in-aid programs . " While conceding that the states , cities and counties have a financial problem , Mr. Mills suggested that it was not so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the advocates of revenue sharing have asserted . He cited a study by two Harvard economists that indicated that state and local government needs by 1975 could be met with a 5 per cent increase in tax rates , plus a normal growth in borrowing . Nor has the Federal Government been tight-fisted with the state and localities , Mr. Mills said . Aid to the states has doubled since 1959 as a proportion of the whole Federal budget , he said , and stands at 14 per cent as of the current fiscal year . Looked at another way , he said , Federal aid to state and local governments represented 131/2 per cent of their total income in 1959 and has risen to more than 18 per cent now . Mr. Mills said that he was discussing only President Nixon 's proposal for " general revenue sharing " ? that is , the plan under which money would be turned over to states and localities with no restrictions oc how it was used The formula for general revenue sharing that would allocate the money to the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wasteful " idea , Mr. Mills said . Under it , he said , " substantial funds are given to states and localities where there is little or no need , as well as to those where there is need . " The method of allocating funds among cities and counties within a- state is even worse , he said , arguing that it would give the most money to the wealthiest areas . Mr. Mills came up with some complex calculations , which , he said , showed that the big industrial states that have some of the worst problems  --  such as New York , New Jersey and Connecticut ? would be the least favored states under the revenue-sharing plan . His computation was based not on the proportion of the shared revenue they would receive but on a comparison of that proportion with the proportion of total Federal taxes paid by residents of these states . Members of Congress would like to be able to vote added expenditures without worrying about where the money would come from , he said , but they can not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on spending programs at the present time , " he said . " If the revenue-sharing machine is to be cranked up , I fear we will lose much of what restraint we now have .
