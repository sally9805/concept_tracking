txt Senator James L. Buckley , surrounded by anxious ship workers and executives at the old Brooklyn Navy Yard yesterday , said he had received " strong , strong assurance " in Washington of a Federal loan guarantee that could restore 3,000 jobs at the depressed Seatrain shipyard . The Conservative Republican Senator said the $40-million loan guarantee , awaiting final approval by the Ford Administration , would allow Scatrain Shipbuilding to resume work on the supertankers Stuyvesant and Bay Ridge at the yard . Construction of the giant ships was halted last January and the 3,000 workers were laid off when the market for new tankers plummeted . The layoffs , the largest in private industry in the city in more than a year , were a severe blow to the Navy Yard industrialdevelopment plans and to the surrounding communities of Fort Greene , Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg , where most of the workers live . The Beame administration , Representative Frederick W.

Mr. Morton met yesterday afternoon with officials of the Office of Management and Budeet to seek ways to finance the guarantee . The Senator appeared with Seatrain and union officials yesterday at a hastily called news conference at the rainswept yard , officially known as the New York Naval Shipyard . He said he had acted so swiftly , anticipating approval of the proposal , to give heart to the unemployed ship workers and also , perhaps , to lessen the demands of their creditors . Large Investment Already Mr. Buckley noted that the ' Federal Government , through its subsidies , already had a considerable investment in the two uncompleted tankers and was also spending millions in welfare benefits for the unemployed workers . The loan guarantee , followed by completion and sale of the ships , would return the subsidies to the Government and remove the v:orkers from the welfare rolls , he said .

Their sister ships , the Brooklyn and Williamsburgh , were completed at the Seatrain yards in 1973 and 1974 and are now carrying oil from the Persian Gulf to northern Europe . Recent declines in oil consumption , however , have depressed the market for tankers . Seatrain 's banks , fearing the new ships could not be sold when completed , declined to extend credit and thus work was stopped in January . Buckley Lauded . Toseph Kahn. chairman of the board of Seatrain Lines , Inc. , the parent company of Seatrain Shipbuilding , said the $40-million loan guarantee , if approved , would enable the company to get bank loans for completion of the ships . He praised the work of Senator Buckley and the area 's Representatives in the effort . " The Senator worked like a champ in this , " he said . John A.

Mr. Serrie said that the rehiring of workers would be a gradual process but that he . hoped all 3,000 could be back ' on the job by the end of the , year . Mayor Beane and Representatives Richmond and Chisholm issued statements welcoming the Senator 's announcement . The Representatives noted that 85 per cent of the workers were black or Spanish-. speaking , and that unemploy-. ment among minority groups : in their areas was 20 per cent .. " We hope this proposal will he given top priority by the ? Ford Administration and will he expedited so that the families of these workers can , once again breathe easily , their statement said . Frank Drozak , vice president of the Seafarers International Union . representing the yard workers , said resumption of work would he a joyful time for the men and women laid off .

Seatrain is by far the largest employer at the Navy Yard . which the city has attempted to make into an industrial park . There are 27 other companies in the 263-acre yard . with a total of 2,200 employes
