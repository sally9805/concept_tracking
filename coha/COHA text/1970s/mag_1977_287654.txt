In the long drive to get their man elected President , William Hamilton Jordan , 32 , and Joseph Lester Powell Jr. , 33 , broke most of the rules of politics . Now that Jimmy Carter has reached the White House , the two young men - just call ' em Ham and Jody-are still breaking the rules . <P> Jordan , the top White House aide , and Powell , the press secretary , dress as they please , ridicule pretense , joke incessantly , talk back to the boss , shun lunch at Sans Souci and rarely turn up at social functions ; Jordan wears a black tie as if it were a noose . The pair are the wonder and dismay of Establishment Washington . They are country boys who have come so far , so fast , that the red clay of their native Georgia still clings , as it were , to their shoes , their accents and their lifestyles . They relish politics more for the pleasure than the power , more for the gambol than the glory . They are almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them what a somber place it is supposed to be . Though they may not reflect the substance of the Carter presidency , they are the living image of its down-home style . <P> Many of our Presidents have had one man to keep them informed and another to keep them laughing ; one for work , the other for relaxation . Harry Truman talked policy with Clark Clifford and played poker with General Harry Vaughan ; Dwight Eisenhower had Sherman Adams for the heavy duty and George Allen for the lighter moments ; John Kennedy learned from Ted Sorensen and kidded with Dave Powers . <P> In Carter 's case , the crony and the counselor are rolled into one-or rather , two . With their infectious spirits , Jordan and Powell express a frolicsome side of the President that he tends to keep under very stern control . Yet they have also been an indispensable part of the presidential quest from the beginning ( Jordan first worked for Carter in 1966 , Powell in 1969 ) . Now that their man has achieved his goal , they fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at annual salaries of $56,000 apiece . <P> Does this mean , as some observers marvel , that two kids from rural Georgia are " running the country , " or are " the second and third most powerful figures in the Government " ? No . For all their breezy irreverence , despite their almost unlimited license to tell the President what they think , their actual powers are circumscribed-another illustration of Carter 's canny use of people . <P> The pair have not been given the concentrated authority of those in similar positions under previous Presidents . They have an input in formulating policy , but no more than that . They have the ear of the President whenever they ask for it , but he heeds many other voices too . Carter insists on keeping open several lines of communication , and no H.R. Haldeman stands imperiously at his door .
