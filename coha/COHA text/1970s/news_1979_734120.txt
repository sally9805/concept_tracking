txt IN TILE BIG WAR over there , the Bismarck was a symbol of the supremacy of the German navy . Answering the battle cry " Sink the Bismarck " the British Navy shot the German battleship full of holes and watched it sink on May 27 , 1941 . In political wars over here , the Bismarck has been a symbol of Democratic Party supremacy . As in past elections , party loyalists rallied at the hotel-theater in support of Mayor Bilandic and gathered there on primary election night to celebrate his anticipated victory . Challenger Jane Byrne shot their plans full of holes on Feb. 27 , 1979 . But Jane Byrne certainly does n't want to sink the Bismarck . It is , after all , her ship . Close-up With Michael Hirsley Since her primary victory , Airs . Byrne has been returning to the Binmarch like an admiral preparing to take over a ship command , inspecting it for damages and reassuring the crew/ that there is smooth sailing ahead . LAST WEEK she was piped aboard at the Bismarck by the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carley George Dunne ( right ) , the Democratic Party chairman . leads the applause for Jane Byrne at Monday 's meeting of precinct captains . Byrne in command on the Bismarck // ward committeemen , who vowed their support . On Monday she got down to the boiler-room level , meeting some 400 precinct captains whose job is to transform their committeemen 's vows into votes April 3 against Republican candidate Wallace Johnson . As Mrs. Byrne strode to the dais in a white dress with a small red rose applique commemorating St. Joseph 's Day , the captains rose above their plates of chicken , green beans with almonds , and peaches dabbed with strawberry preserves to give her a tame standing ovation . To ease the transition to an unexpected new commander , party leaders George Dunne and Ald. Wilson Frost 34th tried to explain what had happened Feb. 27 in a benign manner . COOK COUNTY Democratic Party Chairman Dunne compared Byrne 's victory to that of De Paul University 's basketball tear* which has reached the college basketball championship semifinals . " Recent events give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dunne said , " in sports as well as politics . " City Council Floor Leader Frost said the Democratic Party here was like a track team in a relay race , " and the people of Chicago passed the baton to Jane Byrne . " If the captains still showed some disbelief at seeing a huge poster of Jane Byrne where Bilandic 's poster had been less than a month ago , there was nonetheless a feeling of confidence , perhaps even overconfidence , about the coming election . Cecil Partee , Democratic candidate for city treasurer , phrased that confidence when lm called Mrs. Byrne the " obvious mayor . " He then cautioned workers . " Never enumerate fowls prior to germination , or do n't vomit your chickens before they 're hatched ! ' DESPITE Ills quip  --  and the warmup messages from Dunne and Frost ? the party minions needed motivating from their candidate . And when her turn to speak arrived , Jane Byrne delivered the jolt . She quickly ingratiated herself with the crowd by beginning , " I came here today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a little bit of time . Tins has always been the greatest Democratic Party in the United States . We all worked together under the late Richard J. Daley . . . She reminded.them of past successes , mentioned John F. Kennedy , then told them they needed a big vote on April 3 , hi effect , regardless of whether they liked her as an individual . " We do need a big vote , but not for Jane Byrne , " she said . It is needed , she said , " because it 's been written Close-up up all over the world what happened here fin the primary ' . And a lot of people , including a lot of Republicans , will be looking here to see whether or not we can get our act together . " Imminent state and national elections could be affected by the Chicago vote April 3 , she said , exhorting , " We 're going to have to show the world that what happened here is like a fight in the family , where you always make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that her fight had teen ' with the administration , " not the Democratic Party , " and that her victory might have been achieved because " some people did n't feel in. eluded in the party . " As the captains and their leaders strode out , there were signs that her message had been effective . " Everything will be all right , " beamed Ald. Vito Marzullo 125th 1 , longtime party leader . " She 's coining back . No one walks alone in this world . " One precinct captain , who withheld Ins name , said , " This is a hell of a homecoming for her . She 's been around here in the background a long time . Now , site 's at center stage . She 'll make a lovely candidate . " APPARENTLY AGREEING was Sewer Commissioner Ed Quigley , wh had reacted somewhat crudely the morning after Byrne 's stunning upset . Since then , he 's seen the light  --  and is trying to stand in its glow . Last week he planted a kiss on the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her new campaign buttons  --  and made sure the right people were wearing them . Before the speechmaking , Quigley edged up to Dunne , who shared center-dias with Byrne , and inquired discreetly . " Rey , Dunne , where 's your button ? " After the meeting , Dunne was asked if he expected any public show of support for Byrne from Bilandie , " Ile may at some point in time . It 's up to him , " Dunne said , then added with a grin , " lie 's not a committeeman , you know . " A luncheon for another 400 precinct captains is scheduled next Monday at the Bismarck . Less than a month ago , when the theater 's marquee read , " Ile-Elect Mayor Bilandie , Keep Chicago Strong , Election Eight Rally , 7:30 p.m. , " Jane Byrne would have been about as welcome as a British officer on the battleship Bismarck . But on Monday she seemed as cont. fortabte as Shirley Temple on the Good Ship Lollipop .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
