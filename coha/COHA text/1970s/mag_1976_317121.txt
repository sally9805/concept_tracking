THE PRESIDENCY <P> " I am the first to admit that I am no great orator or no person that got where I have gotten by any William Jennings Bryan technique , " Jerry Ford said a few days ago , proving his point even as he spoke . Then he proved it even more convincingly in his State of the Union address , with its ranks of square , gray sentences marching by . <P> Ford 's sallies into international diplomacy have been marred by little things like tripping on the airplane ramp in Salzburg , or finding himself yucking it up with a geisha named Honorable Treasure Pleasure in Japan while the U.S. stock market plummeted and Chrysler Corp . announced it was closing five plants . His relentless political assault on the American people last fall is now regarded by almost every opinion analyst as a major factor in his year-end decline in the polls . <P> But last week he may have found his format . Of all things , it was the budget . He walked through its corridors of forbidding figures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials and newsmen . He rarely had to refer to his notes or call on his aides . Ford not only knew his budget , he felt it , found romance in the balance sheets . There was a kind of boardroom eloquence about the President in this environment , moving from table to chart , talking of dollars and sense . Even those who disagree philosophically with Ford admitted that he had done a masterly job of presenting his case . One old budget bureaucrat who has seen Presidents come and go said , " God , but he is good at this . " <P> Richard Nixon got angry when he was burdened with too many budget details and fired his budget director , Robert Mayo . Lyndon Johnson used to glaze over as his budget was discussed , reviving only to query bizarre items like the crotch size in the Air Force uniform trousers . Ford not only put the figures together ; it is plain to almost anyone who reads the budget documents that here is a splendid profile of Ford himself , a statement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler room of Government . It is not beyond belief that Ford might choose to stay down there trying to make things work , the way he has drawn the plans . If he were to do that , he might not only shore up his sagging presidency but also present his strongest political side to the public . <P> It is a middle-class budget . Ford made no bones about that in his hundreds of hours of meetings with men like Jim Lynn and Paul O'Neill of the Office of Management and Budget . Feet on the desk , sometimes in the Oval Office , sometimes in the study , he puffed his pipe and scratched away with his felt-tipped pen . " I do n't want to take anything away from the people who need it , " he said about his tax proposals , " but if I have anything to give , I want to give it to the middle-income people . " He believes the burdens of our society have grown disproportionately heavy for those in that bracket . <P> To the extent that Ford ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when O'Neill told him there were 700,000 children below the poverty line who could not qualify for school lunches . Yet Lynn 's kids at Bethesda 's high-income Walt Whitman High School got a 23 subsidy for each meal at school . Ford ordered his proposal to cut aid for those who can pay and target it for the destitute .
