Riding a wave of patriotism , the President becomes the front runner <P> He asked that Americans fly the flag to indicate support for the 50 U.S. hostages in Iran . Across the country last week , flags flew . He asked for letters to the hostages . From every corner of the nation , the mail poured forth . The national Christmas tree that he had refused to illumine remained dark behind the White House as a reminder of the hostages ' plight . And then , in response to Tehran 's renewed threats to put the hostages on trial for spying , he threatened economic sanctions and even a naval blockade to cut off the world 's commerce with Iran . <P> This was Jimmy Carter , President , leading the U.S. in a way that , until the Iranian crisis erupted in November , the former Governor of Georgia had not managed in his three years in the White House . Through those first thousand days , Carter had stumbled and tripped , scored some victories , but lost his way many times .

So inept , indeed , that Senator Edward M. Kennedy , before announcing his candidacy last month , held a 2-to-l lead over Carter as the choice for the Democratic presidential nomination . All that has now changed . Riding a wave of patriotic fervor and a degree of unanimity unseen in this country since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 , Jimmy Carter has suddenly become , according to the latest polls , the solid choice to be renominated and re-elected to a second term in the White House . <P> According to a survey of public opinion conducted for TIME Dec. 10 through Dec. 12 by Yankelovich , Skelly and White Inc. , Carter leads Kennedy 53 to 33 among Democrats and independents. * That result , obtained from telephone interviews with 1,041 registered voters , reflects one of the most dramatic political turnabouts in modern American political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy seizure on Nov. 4 , Carter trailed Kennedy by ten points , meaning that he has surged 30 percentage points in one month . As recently as August , Kennedy led Carter by 33 percentage points , which means there has been a shift of 63 percentage points in four months . An even more ominous sign for the Kennedy candidacy is the Yankelovich finding that among Democrats , even those who call themselves liberal Democrats , Kennedy 's once commanding lead has been erased . <P> The Carter lead over Kennedy covers all parts of the country . In Kennedy 's previous stronghold , the Northeast , Carter leads 47 to 39 . In the West , where Carter failed to carry a single state against Gerald Ford in 1976 and where Kennedy has been strong , Carter is ahead 49 to 35 . At the same time , Jerry Brown has virtually been pushed off the board as a serious presidential candidate .
