John Olmsted , director of the institute , describes the half-mile-wide , three-mile-long staircase as " a whole , perfect , small museum " and a metaphor for the kind of ecological decisions society will have to make during the next few years . Half a million 3. ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal history over the last 500,000 years . Thousands of people ? from schoolchildren to scientists ? have visited and studied this natural phenomenon which begins in a tide pool , turns into sea bluffs , then into Mexican pine forests , then into spruce forests , and finally into the six-foot-high pygmy forest . The institute already owns part of the staircase and nearly 140 acres surrounding it Over the next decade the institute must meet payments of $200,000 on the land . The proposed 12-acre motel site , on the fist step bordering Jughandle Creek , would destroy the watershed of the creek and impair the entire area . " The four business partners behind the motel , " said Mr. Olmsted , " I 'm sure feel threatened by the ecology movement We tried to talk with them about a compromise , about building a motel that would serve the forest and not destroy it . But they are determined to build there .
