Everybody talks about the weather , but nobody can do much about it even today . Short-range forecasting has improved enormously in recent years , even though squalls occur on days when the weatherman insists the precipitation probability is near zero . And despite great advances in techniques and technology , the discipline of climatology-the study of long-range trends in weather-is still an inexact science , to say the least . Climatologists still disagree on whether earth 's long-range outlook is another ice age , which could bring mass starvation and fuel shortages , or a warming trend , which could melt the polar icecaps and flood coastal cities . <P> In fact , scientists have been unable to explain the basic causes of the bizarre weather that afflicted much of the world this summer . Record rains and floods soaked some areas , while droughts parched others , with potentially serious social , economic and political effects . Some examples : <P> WESTERN EUROPE has recorded one of the hottest , dryest summers in a century . City dwellers have sweltered through abnormally hot days . Farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and West Germany went months without rain , while their fields dried out and their crops shriveled . " My potatoes that should be fist-sized are as big as my thumb , " complained a farmer near the small Bavarian village of Hersbruck . " That 's what this cursed weather has done . " The drought has also turned what promised to be a record British grain harvest into a disaster , lowering harvest expectations from 17.5 million tons to an anticipated 13.8 million . The grain shortage , in turn , is expected to drive the price of animal feed up by some 20% , thus raising the price of beef . Agricultural losses in Germany could be as much as $2 billion . <P> The prolonged dry spell has also affected transportation . The levels of some German rivers and French canals have dropped so low that barges are carrying reduced loads in order to ride higher in the water . It has also hit hard at the Continent 's power systems . With many rivers flowing at only a third of their normal volume and hydroelectric output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million extra tons of oil to meet customer demands for power . As the drought continued in Yugoslavia , Czechoslovakia and Hungary , rains began to fall in Western Europe-too little and too late to be of much help . <P> AFRICA has been struck by localized droughts in Tanzania , Kenya and in the northern parts of heavily populated Nigeria and Ghana . Near normal rains in the Sahel-the southern edge of the Sahara , where as many as half a million died in the great 1972-74 drought-have brought adequate harvests , but the moisture may prove to be a mixed blessing . The rainfall spawned an almost biblical plague of rats , locusts and caterpillars in Mali , Senegal , Mauritania and Upper Volta . Millions of gerbils , which U.S. children often keep as pets , are loose on the land in Niger , devouring everything in sight . <P> ASIA , on the other hand , has seen the return of the monsoons in much of India , Pakistan and Bangladesh , which is moving toward self-sufficiency in food production .
