I found it . I found it . " Ted Turner , the famous detective , has found it . He had been searching for it over the past couple of days , or approximately since the dinner conversation during which Ted Turner , the famous basketball owner , told somebody how his miserable Atlanta Hawks were surprising the opposition just the way the Macedonians had surprised the Persians at Quagmala . Or Quagmira , or Guagmoola , or Guacamole , or somewhere . Ted Turner , the famous researcher , was n't sure where the Macedonian upset occurred or how to spell the name of the place . " Nobody expected that either , " he had said . " Outnumbered five to one , there they were . Alexander the Great digging in with his famous phalanxes .

Henry Kissinger ? Anita Bryant ? Has anyone transcended his profession , grown bigger than life , become important , become a star any faster than Robert E. Turner III ? // Whatever it is Ted Turner has accomplished  --  and some people are still trying to figure out just what that is  --  he has done it so suddenly that the saga-mongers who take care of such things have n't had time to immortalize him with a proper nickname . " Mouth of the South " and " Teddy Ballgame , " the protein monikers , were heisted from a noisy sportscaster and a lefthand-hitting leftfielder , respectively , not to mention that they hardly do justice to the man . Even " The Pirate of Peachtree , " which nicely combines the nautical and geographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and basketball players and sailing crews and communications company personnel are admonished to call him " Ted . " His secretary , Dee Woods , a vivacious mother of four , calls him " Teddy Baby " as a result of the time she answered a request with " Sir ? " and he bellowed " What 's this ' Sir ' crap ? " Only 9-year-old Jennie , his youngest child , can get away with calling him Sir . // Father : " Hey , Jen , tell our guest I 'm not a fire-eating , maniacal madman who beats you and denies you porridge and deserves to be thrown out of our national pastime . Do n't I remind you to brush your teeth ? " // Daughter : " No , Sir ; yes , Sir .

" in honor of his winning the America 's Cup last fall at the wheel of Courageous . Not long ago a very old black woman with a charming disregard for ceremony beckoned to Turner in the parking lot of his TV station . " Hey , Turner , " she shouted , " gim me some of that chaw. " // Somewhat taken aback for one of the few times in his 39 years , Turner approached the woman warily . " You want this ?

" And I wants you to come bail me out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // After assuring the woman she could only get sick , not drunk , from chewing tobacco , Turner watched in horror as the woman shoved a handful into her mouth . Then he walked away . // " Hey , Turner , " the woman shouted , her words muffled by the chaw , " you better getsh the Bravesh off their buttsh. " // In the 24 hours surrounding this particular encounter last fall , Turner had been in the process of doing just that . Besides interviewing applicants for the Braves ' managerial job and figuring out how long he could sit in his office without Bowie Kuhn finding out and disciplining the then-suspended owner , Turner also was in the midst of : // Adding several new stations , cities , states and emerging nations to his massive satellite cable-TV network ; making plans and assembling crews for competing on the Southern Ocean Racing Circuit ; nearly suffering a heart attack every time his bargain-basement basketball Hawks got close to winning a game ; attempting to get his 17-year-old daughter , Laura Lee , into a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legendary Turner rebelliousness ( Laura Lee was 0 for 1 in schools ) ; eating , sleeping , playing backgammon ; driving his Toyota through rainstorms while avoiding the sudden return splat of his own saliva into his face as he hawked out the window ; bargaining with a journalist over the sale of a horrible , open-mouthed , mounted rattlesnake head , a sicker , more disgusting thing the journalist was positive did not exist . " I got it for 50 . It 's yours for a hundred , " Turner said . " You think that 's sick . Wait till you see my winged bat . " // In a way his frenetic , **29;449;TOOLONG style is precisely what makes Ted Turner such an engrossing character . It is also what makes him so hard to delineate . On the one hand there is the cold , hard , ruthless , money-grubbing , commercial , conglomerate Turner , who upon buying the Braves , unceremoniously fired the team 's popular traveling secretary  --  a dwarf , yet  --  and who says , " Life is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the other hand , there is Turner , the litterateur , the romanticist , the boy on the burning deck , the man who in a speech after winning the Sydney-Hobart boat race could paraphrase from The Niggerof the ' Narcissus ' and Youth : // " Ah ! The good old time  --  the good old time . Youth and the sea . Glamour and the sea ! The good , strong sea , the salt , bitter sea , that could whisper to you and roar at you and knock your breath out of you .... The crew of the American Eagle drifted out of sight . I never saw them again . The sea took some , the steamers took others , the graveyards of the earth will account for the rest .... So be it ! Let the earth and sea each have its own . " // Now , of course , earth and sea have Ted Turner , and the Braves and the Hawks have him , and the talk shows have him and , for better or worse , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? // Among his incongruous pursuits , the majority owner of Turner Communications Corporation has attended a state dinner at the White House and ridden in an ostrich race at Atlanta Stadium . " One lap ? " the competitor in him screamed . " How the hell can you determine the fastest ostrich in one lap ? " He has read the Bible twice from cover to cover and has permitted the screening of pornographic movies for his baseball players and their wives on a bus ride from Plains , Ga . to Atlanta . He has nudged a baseball around the base paths with his nose , as a gimmick , and sailed a boat in a triangle to show the yachting Establishment that a guy like Ted Turner could win the America 's Cup . // At one time , most of Turner 's businesses have been , as he puts it , " at death 's door . " In 1977 his last-place baseball team lost a million five . Way back , there were much darker days . His teen-aged sister slowly died of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is in constant turmoil because of his much-publicized flirtations . His eldest daughter from his first marriage is on the threshold , he says , of " delinquentville . " Yet Ted Turner seems not to have had a depressing day in his life . " I 'm super . " he bellows in reply to the standard greeting , morning , noon and night . " I 'm always super . " Pat Williams , the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers , says , " Ted Turner is every kid who ever got loose in Disney World . " // Peter Dames , the president of the outdoor advertising branch of TCC , says of Turner , " Talking to him is like talking to a radio . " Hubie Brown , the Hawks ' coach , says , " Sit him down and he is one of the alltime great listeners . " // Turner says that a magazine columnist once called him " ' the most multifaceted individual he had ever met . ' Multifaceted . And this guy had been all over . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he was this magazine 's top guy . Their top guy . Multifaceted . Damn ! " // On such occasions , Turner exhibits a childlike naivet ? ; it is as though one part of him has n't caught up with the other . Dee Woods says Turner flew in from a trip recently , rushed in and blurted out , " Dee , a taxi driver in New York recognized me ! Can you believe that ? " // On another evening , while Turner was sitting courtside at a Hawks game , Rick Barry came over and congratulated him on the America 's Cup defense . Minutes passed . Then Turner said to a companion , " Gee , was n't that amazing of Rick Barry ? " More minutes passed . Then Turner said , " Is Rick Barry a forward ? " // Turner 's ignorance about both baseball and basketball is a matter of public record as well as the basis of many jokes he tells on himself . After two years as owner of the Braves , he thinks he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball has him stumped . // He is forever calling NBA coaches " managers " and officials " umpires . " Although Turner knows his Hawks are " not too shabby " but rather " strawwwnnnng " ( two of the more annoying expressions in the terrific Turner lexicon someone once called " Southern bebop " ) , he does not seem to know their names or what positions they play . For instance , former Hawk Ron Behagen was always " Ber-hagen " to Turner . When the hulking , 6 ' 7 " forward , John Brown  --  whose name Turner appears to have less difficulty pronouncing  --  fouled out of a game , the owner jumped up and yelped , " Golly ! Now we 've got only three guards left . " Later in the same game , after the Hawks were warned for using the illegal zone defense , Turner was bewildered . // " What the hell was that ? " he said . // " A zone warning , " he was told . // " Awww for Chrissakes , forget it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better command of the facts of his own life . " Was I married both times on the same date ? " he said recently , repeating a question . " Dee ? " he screamed at his secretary . " Do I have the same wedding anniversary twice ? " // Turner has little trouble recalling profit and loss statements , sailing results and his favorite passages from literature , but when he tries to remember whether he has three sons and two daughters or is it three daughters and two sons , he often has to resort to prayer . By the same token , Turner seldom negotiates the 30-minute drive into downtown Atlanta from his modest , magnolia-trimmed home near suburban Marietta without getting hopelessly lost . He has been making this trip for four years . " Someday I know I 'll end up in Tennessee , " he says . // Turner even has taken to scrawling the names of new business associates on his wrist with a Magic Marker so he wo n't forget them . Still , last year , while negotiating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the player as " Rich Little . " // " How come you keep calling me ' Kristofferson ' ? " Turner was asked one day by a writer whose name was not Kristofferson but who wanted to believe that Turner saw in him something of the macho singer-actor. // " Because you got long hair , " said Turner . // " Why do n't you write my name on your wrist ? " asked the writer . // " Because I do n't have to impress jerks , " said Turner . // Apart from his ability to keep up an endless stream of hyperbolic chatter  --  oral italics as it were  --  and to not take himself or anybody else too seriously , the main reason Turner is such a media favorite is that he is honest . // Turner lives by the " just spell the name right , boys " code with journalists and is usually on friendly terms with media reps , both big and small . After Tom Snyder had grilled Turner for 90 minutes , the TV host said he had enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guy yourself , Snyder , " replied Turner . // Turner has never been accused of pulling punches . Honor , truth , sincerity  --  these are his bywords . He subscribes wholeheartedly to the self-description by Nick in The Great Gatsby , who said , " Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues , and this is mine : I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known . " // Because Turner likes to mix honesty with his booze , he has regularly immersed himself in deep water not even Courageous could get him out of . // Turner did n't drink until he was 19 years old , yet following his drunken fiasco of a press conference after winning the America 's Cup , the public got the impression that he has been a monumental lush since infancy . In truth , Turner is what your neighborhood bartender might refer to as a quick drunk , a two-beer goner . Until his grand toot , he was rarely seen in Newport bars . He was keeping his nose clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courageous , had asked him to . // Because he has trouble determining where or who he is and what he is saying after a few pops , Turner had been suspended from baseball for a year by Commissioner Kuhn. // On the night in 1976 when he exhibited " conduct unbecoming to baseball " ( i.e. , told San Francisco co-owner Robert Lurie he would offer Gary Matthews , a Giant outfielder who was about to become a free agent , twice the money Lurie would ) , Turner claims he had downed " six vodkas and was obviously inebriated . " Not to mention fairly ignorant of exactly who Gary Matthews was . // At Turner 's hearing before Kuhn , Wells Twombley , a sports columnist who has since died , testified that he had heard Turner call Lurie " a little sheeny . " Though both Lurie and Turner deny the " sheeny " remark , Turner was later criticized by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for his remarks concerning agent Jerry Kapstein in a speech Turner made to a group of sports media people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike a guy besides the fact he wears a full-length fur coat and is a Jew , " Turner had said . // Later Turner publicly apologized for his " flippant " statement , but that did not stop a couple of NBA owners , the Knicks ' Michael Burke and the Bullets ' Abe Pollin , from distributing a letter to their fellow owners insisting that Turner be reprimanded . Burke and Pollin later withdrew their statements and apologized themselves , explaining they had " misinterpreted . " // For Turner , who abhors most agents ( " when they smile , blood drips off their teeth " ) , who particularly dislikes Kapstein and his negotiation methods and who swears he will never again have a Kapstein client on the Braves , this was the supreme example of his outspokenness not exactly being the best policy . Other owners , known to be equally wary of Kapstein , have held their tongues . // The ethnic slurs aside , in both instances Turner had ranged himself against the Establishment , and in the Matthews incident , against what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner had also expressed his **26;480;TOOLONG . At a glittering party of beautiful people whose names began with initials and ended with numerals , a party to which he had been invited by an Atlanta couple he did n't know , Turner was patronized , foisted off by the couple as " their friend " and showcased around like a stuffed celeb doll . After a few hours and a bunch of Southern Comforts , Turner took a powder , infuriating American yachtdom. // Similarly , the captain 's falling-out with the owner of the Black Pearl , the popular Newport watering hole from which Turner was barred , occurred only because , as Turner claims , " The guy was acting like a king of the mountain , crowing about his money and being a pompous ass . Look , I had to put him down . I apologized later in the summer , but I ca n't stand phony airs . That 's the whole thing . The phoniness in the world . All this just ticks me off . Injustice . I hate injustice . // " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their sleeves and get the job done . See , I 'm not wrong . I 'm getting a bum rap . I 'm not a wild man . I 'm not a bad guy . I 'm not like some owners I could name . Pro sports has become filthy ; it 's a double-dealing , rotten business . There 's all this terror and intrigue and fratricide . I 'm sick of it . Sports should be fun . My Braves and my Hawks play clean . They may be underpaid but they have fun . They 're honorable . In yachting , men understand that . You 're assumed to be a gentleman . You 're assumed to have honor . " // This always has been a constant with Turner . One goes back to the Kuhn hearing on his suspension when , under cross-examination by attorney Richard Wertheimer , Turner exploded . " After this is over , you keep that up and you 'll get a knuckle sandwich , " he roared . The other day Turner was asked what Wertheimer had said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely said . " The man questioned my honor . " // Robert E. Turner II was the one who instilled this attitude . Honor of family . Ted Turner 's father was a stern , tough , self-made man who had worked up from the dirt as a child in Mississippi . He started a family in Cincinnati , moved to Savannah  --  where his son and namesake began a lifelong affair with the sea  --  and branched out to establish a successful , albeit struggling , outdoor-advertising company in other small cities in the South . " People think I 'm a crazy man , " Turner says . " But my father , he really was the crazy man . He lived hard , played hard , did outrageous things . I mean , he used to go into bars and get in fights and stuff . " // As a youngster , Turner was instructed to read a book every two days . He was disciplined with a wire coat hanger . He was put to work in the family business digging post holes . One summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week by his father and was charged $25 to live at home . " My father put the screws to me early , " Turner says . " If he had n't , I never would have survived . My father made me a man . " // The family 's home life was tragic , owing to a bad marriage , which was to end in divorce , and the debilitating condition of Turner 's sister , who died of lupus at 17 . " She came out of a coma with her brain destroyed , " Turner says . " It was a horror show of major proportions . Padded rooms . Screaming at night . It was something out of Dark Shadows . " // At 11 , Turner had avoided much of this because he was sent off to military school in Chattanooga . Even though he despised it , Turner remained at the MacCallie School for six years , applied himself and graduated in the top 15% of his class as a company commander . ( Later , he would send Robert Edward Turner IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Turner planned to major in classics , his father wrote him a remarkable letter ( Turner had it published in the school newspaper ) in which the elder Turner expressed his dim views of his son 's course of study . He " almost puked " upon hearing the news , the old man wrote . He described Aristotle and Plato as " old bastards " and closed , " ... you are rapidly becoming a jackass , and the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere , the better .... You are in the hands of the Philistines , and dammit , I sent you there . I am sorry . Devotedly , Dad . " The father demanded something more practical . The son switched majors to economics . Honor . // After his father 's suicide in 1962 , holding his legacy of a broken-down business $6 million in debt ( which the doomed man had attempted to sell off at the final hour ) , the 24-year-old Turner spurned the advice of a battery of family financial advisers who told him to give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts , kept control of the company , saved it and , above all , saved the family 's name . Honor . // Now Turner Communications is an enormous corporate mixed bag consisting of WTCG-TV in Atlanta , WRET-TV in Charlotte , N.C. , several billboard companies and satellite cables . It also owns TV rights to nearly 30% of all the old movies seen in the Western world , part shares of a baseball and basketball team , a major piece of a mounted rattlesnake head  --  and who knows what all else  --  and it is rolling along , with revenues increasing 300% over the last four years . Duty with honor . // " My father was halfway to the big time , " says Turner . " I think he saw me as the only hope for the family to go all the way . He was working too hard , drinking too much , popping pills , sick all the time . The pressure finally got him . Two years before , he said he would n't mind if he died . I knew then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same gun that he taught me to shoot with . At the end the banks would n't even honor the check for his funeral . It took my father all his life to get to Atlanta . I was n't goin ' back . No way . It was a hard , bad road . Listen , bubby . I 've been in last place a long time . " // In his book keyed to the 1974 America 's Cup , The Grand Gesture , Roger Vaughan , a classmate of Ted Turner 's at Brown , recalls him as wearing three-piece suits , bow ties , felt hats , Chesterfield coats and the like . " Turner was likable , even enjoyable , " wrote Vaughan , " despite his basic racist tendencies , his chauvinistic approach to women , his elitist view of society , and his fascist ideology .

" But we did n't really lose Ted , " Workman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real humanist will always go out of his way to be different . " // At college , Turner did things like shoot a rifle from a window , burn down his fraternity 's homecoming display and terrorize the ladies . " Ted was never a serious student by any measure , " says William Kennedy , Brown ' 60 , who is now assistant director of university relations . " We caroused together . Ted was also a bigot , as maybe all of us were in a sense at that time . Often he would go out in a group , after a lot of drinking , and sing Nazi songs outside the Jewish fraternity , or he would put signs reading WARNINGS FROM THE KU KLUX KLAN on the doors of the few blacks at Brown . He was n't vicious . He was just trying to be one of the boys . " // Of this activity , Turner says today : " Oh , those were just childish pranks .

" As for " the blacks , " Turner says , " most of them are n't black , anyway . They 're brown . Well , are n't they ? It 's very seldom you see a really black black . The blacks can tell who pays lip service and who 's sincere . The blacks love me. " // Turner was expelled from Brown in his sophomore year for being caught in a dorm room at Wheaton , a girls ' college in nearby Norton , Mass . Then he joined the Coast Guard . Back in Providence after keeping the enemy out of Palm Beach , Turner was expelled from Brown again in his senior year after a Wheaton girl was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I understand students can entertain girls here , " Turner said in a speech on the Brown campus not long ago . " I was way ahead of my time . " // In nearly every twist of Turner 's scholastic fate , the strong hand of his father could be seen : the sophomore spree is regarded by Turner as a reaction to his father 's refusal to let him take a summer job at a Connecticut yacht club . Up to then Turner had stood by a parental agreement to refrain from drinking until he was 21 ( for which he was to get a $5,000 reward ) . But that night , angered and forlorn over his father 's decision , Turner got plastered . Then he got caught with the girl . Then he got thrown out of college . By the time of his second dismissal , Turner says he was leaving Brown anyway because his father  --  suffering from alcoholism himself  --  refused to pay for the schooling of a by-now regularly imbibing young ruffian . // " I did n't fail college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Grand Gesture . But the true failures seemed to be those of the son and the father , each to the other . // " Look , this is amazing , " Turner said the other day in his office , pointing to an array of paintings and photographs : to assorted baseball , basketball , sailing and television memorabilia ; to a wall completely hidden by trophy shelves full of silver , polished brass and cut crystal . " This would be amazing to my father . // " I remember him telling me about the New York Yacht Club once . How it was swank and ritzy and all . My father never would have dreamed of me being in that room . That I 'd be a member . That I 'd defend the America 's Cup . Lord , it would blow his mind .

A Chicago reporter says Turner once told him he thought he might die the same way his father did , and Turner once persuaded Dale Murphy , the Braves ' young Mormon catcher , to choose baseball over missionary work by saying , " God 's always over .500 . I 'm dyin ' here , Murphy . Do you want the blood of seven people on your hands ? You leave me and I got to shoot myself and my whole family . " // At any rate , Turner first and foremost is a sailor , and sailors are always in close touch with their destiny . // It is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this fascinating man 's life that , save for a Chichester here , a Popeye there , he has somehow found time to become the world 's best-known sailor . From modest beginnings on the Skidaway River in Savannah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island when the America 's Cup competition was reborn in 1958 , Turner has been a national champion in three different classes  --  Y Flyer , 5.5 Meter and Flying Dutchman . He has won two SORC championships , three Yachtsman of the Year awards ( " That 's like MVP , " he roars ) and countless races on several continents . He has become a companion to sailor kings , a pal of sailor prime ministers  --  and been judged a dismal bust in the America 's Cup Trials of 1974 aboard Mariner . But in Newport ' 77 , Ted Turner became a star . // The captain was all over T shirts , pennants and buttons . He was in newspapers , magazines and all cocktail-party gossip . And there he was , live . Following each race , as Turner took his daily walk from Bannister 's Wharf over the cobblestones of the picturesque New England port , hundreds of cheering townspeople and tourists would surround and follow him in a boisterous scene straight out of the village of Hamelin . By the final race day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grinning , swearing Pied Piper . // Had he chosen that moment for a reverie on the joys of sailing , Turner would have had the crowd even more spellbound . He has , in quieter moments , reflected , " Some races are so beautiful that you 're sorry to finish . There are times when the weather is perfect . The Montego Bay race in ' 66 was one . It was a full moon , clear nights , warm , and there was a good wind . The world was beautiful . In our sport , you 're out there with nature  --  you 're as close to nature as you can be  --  with gulls , flying fish , whales , the dawn , the sunset , the stars . // " You take a deep breath and you feel alive , really alive .

It 's just so beautiful out there . " // At the finish now , in the finest hour of any sailor 's career , following the greatest outpouring of affection ever seen at an America 's Cup race , some people were waiting for Turner to match this eloquence . Alas . During the last trip to shore and a press conference ; after having had innumerable quarts of beer , champagne and  --  bingo !  --  aquavit ( courtesy of some overzealous Swedes ) poured down his throat , Ted Turner arrived at the pinnacle dead drunk . // " You ought to catch those Super Bowl winners when they 've had several hours to enjoy it instead of just a few minutes , " Turner says in his defense . " Honestly , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disappointed in me . He thought I 'd missed my moment . My moment ? How the hell could I be profound ? It was just a boat race . It was over . I had been away all summer . It was time to get back to work . I did n't even have time to make the Today show , and they wanted me bad . I have to work to earn a living . // " Anyway , " said Ted Turner , the famous philosopher , " my father always said to never set goals you can reach in your lifetime . After you accomplished them , there would be nothing left . I 'll have other moments . I 'll have more fun . My teams may keep losing but I 'll enjoy myself . // " No need in sitting alone on the shelf , " Ted Turner , the famous crooner , is singing again . " Come to the Cabaret . Da da da da da , boom , boom , boom . I 'll have a bounce in my step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 'll be a load of compromising . On the road to my horizon . Like a rhinestone cowboy . Riding out in front of a star-spangled rodeo . Like a rhinestone .... // " What I need to do is put out a record , " says Ted Turner , the famous recording artist . " Like Wolfman Jack . Talk about a star . The ' Wolfman 's Favorites . ' You ever hear that ? Yeah . That 's it . Ted Turner 's Favorites . Man , I love the Wolf . He 's so cool . I wanted to send in the money . Get me his favorites . Wolf always says ' ... and remember , the old Wolfman loves you . ' Yeah . I love him . You know what ? I got to get him down here to Atlanta . Me and Wolfman Jack . What a pair . What an affair . What an unstoppable combo ! You know the Wolf ? You know his number ? Hey , Dee ? " // Talk about a star .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
