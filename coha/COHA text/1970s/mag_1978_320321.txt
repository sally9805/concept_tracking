The Crash of 79 ? Forget it . Oh , sure , there will be a quarter or two of very slow growth next year , but the odds are against anything that could even be called a recession . And if a recession does strike , it will be shallow and short . <P> That is the forecast of TIME 'S Board of Economists , who gathered in Manhattan for their quarterly assessment of the outlook , and in the context of recent grim economic tidings , it is rather reassuring . Last week , for example , the Commerce Department reported that the annual rate of inflation in the second quarter was 11% , even worse than first estimated . President Carter huddled with his economic advisers to plan a Stage Two anti-inflation program and warned in a speech to the steelworkers that it will be " tough " and require " some sacrifice from all . " The Federal Reserve made some additional moves to tighten credit , the dollar sank to a new low against the Swiss franc , and prices worried down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also reported that in the second quarter real gross national product-the nation 's output of goods and services , adjusted for inflation - rose at an annual rate of 8.7% . That rate is obviously unsustainable , however , and a slowdown has already begun . Though no one-not even Author Paul Erdman-really believes the apocalyptic prophecies in his bestselling novel The Crash of 79 , some serious forecasters fear a genuine slump next year . <P> The only member of the Board of Economists to predict a recession next year is Beryl Sprinkel , executive vice president of Chicago 's Harris Bank , and he foresees a mild and brief one . His forecast : real G.N.P . will drop 2.4% in the third quarter next year and 3.2% in the fourth quarter , but start back up in early 1980 . Alan Greenspan , formerly President Ford 's chief economic adviser , also sees a recession-but not until 1980 , and then so gentle that it will just about meet the technical definition : two successive quarters of declines in real G.N.P . <P> The other economists expect only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resources Inc. , a forecasting firm , offers a precise computerized prediction : the growth of real G.N.P . will slow from 3.9% in the current quarter to 3.2% in late 1978 , 1.9% in the first quarter of 1979 and 1.1% from April through June next year . But then it will pick up enough to produce a growth rate of 3.1% for all of 1979 ; that would not be far below the 3.9% expected this year , and is probably about as much as the economy can afford without generating even worse inflation . Eckstein 's colleagues differ somewhat on the exact timing and shape of the slowdown , but they accept his general outline .
