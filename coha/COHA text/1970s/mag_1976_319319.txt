The knuckleball comedy The Bad News Bears does not play all its scenes for laughs . In one gritty confrontation , a coach stomps out to the mound and strikes a twelve-year-old to the ground . The moment seems pure fake-believe ; in fact it is a Little League echo of Major propensities . Since the start of this year 's baseball season , aggression has been the order of the day . <P> Last week New York Yankee Lou Piniella slid into Boston Red Sox Catcher Carlton Fisk with enough force to trigger a wild on-field brawl-and bloody fights in the stands . One result : Pitcher Bill Lee was so severely hurt that he may be out for the rest of the season . At an Atlanta Braves-Houston Astros game , a controversial first-base call brought the entire Braves bench storming onto the field . The men in blue were forced to leave the stadium with other men in blue-a police escort . In perhaps the ugliest confrontation of this strange young season , Cardinal Pitcher Lynn McGlothen readily forgave himself after hitting two New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels he has been intimidated by a hitter , he has the right to throw at him . " <P> The same sort of " right " is being exercised in basketball . Boston Celtic Coach Tom Heinsohn rushed onto the court recently in an effort to attack an opposing player . During the N.B.A. play-offs between the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors , Ricky Sobers and Rick Barry momentarily gave up basketball for boxing . Last month hockey suffered a serious disgrace when four Philadelphia Flyer players were arraigned in Toronto on charges of assault and carrying " dangerous weapons " - hockey sticks-during games that resulted in blood on the ice , disorder in the stands and players in the infirmary . Similar Flyer scrimmages have elicited McGlothen-like statements from the opposition of that fight-prone team : " I never have trouble getting up for games against Philadelphia , " says Montreal Canadien Defenseman Larry Robinson . " When you play the Flyers , there are more opportunities to hit people . " <P> Perusing these declarations , gazing at these confrontations , the spectator has every right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport , that the center can not hold-nor can the guard , the forward , the pitcher or the referee . Naked aggression seems on the surface to underline the statement of Political Scientist James Q. Wilson : " People actually get hurt in televised sports programs , and the hurt can not even be justified by a higher cause . By some standards , it is the most shocking form of violence , done merely for sport or fun . "
