" In America , every one finds facilities unknown elsewhere for making or increasing his fortune . The spirit of gain is always on the stretch . " So wrote Alexis de Tocqueville more than a century ago . Today , Americans are making fortunes as fast and ingeniously as ever . In this week 's cover story on the Hot New Rich , we examine how a dozen new millionaires assembled all of these megabucks-and what they are doing with them . <P> Although we included a few celebrities like Steve Cauthen and Peter Frampton , we asked correspondents in six TIME bureaus to seek out local , unpublicized Americans who have quietly and quickly amassed great wealth . They learned that if superaffluence is not widespread or evenly distributed ( a matter examined in our Essay ) , it is at least spreading . Thanks to inflation , a million is not what it used to be , but there are more millionaires . Out of a wealth of candidates , we selected the subjects we thought the most intriguing . <P> Senior Writer Michael Demarest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million dollars . But he is no stranger to the world of wealth . His family tree included two millionaires , and Demarest grew up in England , attending private schools with " the peerage and the beerage . " Demarest notes a difference between European and American rich : " Many Americans do n't know how to spend their money . Perhaps it is in part a result of the Puritan work ethic . " <P> As a journalist , Demarest has savored vicariously the indulgences of the moneyed , covering such gathering places of the wealthy as Manhattan 's Palace Restaurant , where he attended a $500-per-head prix fixe dinner ; the Duke of Bedford 's bashes ; and sundry Sotheby sales , where the rich auction off their baubles . One millionaire Demarest met lived on the ocean liner Ile de France-crossing and recrossing the Atlantic . Demarest speculates that the eccentric bon vivant , keeping up with the times , now lives aboard a Concorde . " Of the newly rich people I have known , few seemed really fulfilled , " says Demarest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich have already won . Those of us who are distinctly unrich can console ourselves with Ruskin 's words : ' There is no wealth but life . ' "
