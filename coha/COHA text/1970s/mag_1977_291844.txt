THE CITY BUILDER by George Konrd Translated by Ivan Sanders Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 184 pages ; $7.95 <P> In The Case Worker ( 1974 ) , Hungarian Novelist and Sociologist George Konrd examined a day in the life of a state welfare worker in Budapest . As a catalogue of human detritus , the novel was both powerful and disturbing ; in its rapid-fire vignettes and tortured ruminations , it strained toward poetry . Konrd was justifiably praised as a promising new international voice and as something even more rare-a sociologist who can write . <P> Konrd 's second novel again deals with a civil servant , an unnamed city planner for a provincial town in an unspecified Eastern European country . However , this time the clients are not bizarre , ruined people but buildings , factories and streets . The abstraction of architecture casts a chill over the planner 's meditations . When he looks at an old man , he peers beyond individual details to " make out the final chapters of Eastern European history , its way of life down to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind thoughts , the well-tended museum of its anxieties , its fits of rage over a strip of grazing land . " <P> This habit of skipping past the physical toward the philosophical makes The City Builder an altogether less-urgent narrative than The Case Worker . The bureaucrat hero has evidently led an interesting , if calamitous life , but he strews the details so negligently through his thoughts that only the most vigilant reader can piece them together . Konrd tries to atone for such cold impersonality by giving his builder a warm , strenuously rhetorical prose style ( gracefully rendered by Translator Ivan Sanders ) . The effect is often striking . Konrd 's metaphors can go off like depth charges : " Marble-faced generals in their epaulets and decorations receive the homage of subservient anniversaries . Men reduced to street names meet on this square . " Yet when he recounts his surreal dreams , the narrator sometimes seems to be giving an unconscious impression of Woody Allen : " A man with a sack stands in the doorway , and when I walk up the stairs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sits on my mouth all the way home and later , sitting by his stove , eats hot noodles from my naked belly . " Still , such moments are well worth enduring for the author 's stern intelligence and overriding awareness of social forces . In his own eccentric way , the city planner is trying to understand the dispiriting decay of his time and his place . He wants to reconcile his early socialist ideals with the " society of centralized reallocation " that he and his fellow bureaucrats have engineered . He wonders why the exercise of power has left him feeling so weak : " A planner can neither improve things nor make them much worse . " His thoughts become increasingly aphoristic : " The bureaucrat is bound to his fellow workers by incurable resentment . " In the end , his rambling monologue amounts to a masterly disquisition on the vanity-and the necessity-of human wishes . Konrd 's novel may not enchant , but it educates.                   @ @
