By traditional measure the 6,860,000 Americans who were unemployed last month should have been a big , painful political lump demanding the ministrations of Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson or Hubert Horatio Humphrey . Those two were ready , bags filled with nostrums . <P> But when Jimmy Carter won in Ohio , Scoop was afield in Queens , N.Y. , trying to salvage the vice presidency out of his primary defeats . Some place over Pennsylvania his cry of " Jobs , jobs , jobs-that 's the only issue in this campaign " drifted toward oblivion . A beefy union patron sat in morose silence at the time of that Jackson defeat and spoke to the point : " Whatever made him think that work was such a big deal ? " It is a big deal , but not like it was in previous campaigns . <P> Hubert Humphrey was at the Kennedy Center watching the Australian Ballet when the network prognosticators awarded the nomination to Carter . The light went out in Humphrey 's dimming star . He had run hard with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he believes will virtually eliminate unemployment by forcing the Government to guarantee a job to every person who wants one . Experts like Economist Charles Schultze are concerned that the bill , while forcing down unemployment , would force up inflation . There is the danger , too , of creating a Rube Goldberg scheme that would founder in its own complexity , or else produce , as Schultze warns , the kind of low-grade make-work that would add up to " a very unattractive program . " No matter . Humphrey waved it before his audiences at every crossroads , easily won the nostalgia vote with his exuberance , but he never could get a grip on all that discontent out in the country that was defined each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . <P> Now we see that the single greatest miscalculation in politics so far this year was the assumption that the old jobs issue would play again in Peoria . The image out of the Depression years returns like the grasshopper every time the unemployment figures rise , and the old pols begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their worn scripts , conjuring grim visions of Herbert Hoover and the Bonus Army . Other politicians , academicians and analysts , all with the same backgrounds , nodded sagely in agreement . A vast majority of the American people , totally engaged in their everyday lives , knew better . <P> We saw how those programs of welfare , social security , unemployment compensation , job retraining and food stamps worked well . Real suffering was prevented . Then the recession bottomed out , and we began to climb out of the trough . Though unemployment remained high , the favorable trend reduced the national fear about joblessness.
