Nixon on television . Once it was commonplace , but for more than 2 years the familiar face has been scarcely glimpsed on TV screens , as the ex-President made only the rarest forays from San Clemente . This week he is back on the screens of America , in the first of four long-awaited interviews with British TV Personality David Frost . In our cover story we give not only a behind-the-scenes account of how the shows were put together , but also a preview of the programs , especially the one dealing with Watergate . <P> In the 90-minute show Frost , who on other topics was rather soft and undemanding , dramatically confronts Nixon with his mistakes .

The matador was talking , carefully , and the bull was unavailable for interviews . The result reveals the incredible number of Nixons that exist inside the former President . The shows are a kind of video psychobiography . " <P> Writing the cover story was a return engagement for Senior Writer Ed Magnuson , our Watergate specialist . " Mag " wrote 21 cover stories on Watergate in 19 months , including the final ones on Nixon 's resignation and the country 's reaction to the pardon . Says he : " It would be nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
