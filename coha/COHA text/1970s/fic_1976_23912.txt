A story by Barry Farrell DESERT MANNERS H E CALMED HIMSELF with deep breaths and shallow sayings . Cool it . Take it easy . Lighten up . Without craning his neck , without giving himself away , lie found the roadside runners in the mirror again . There were two of them , all right , a big guy in dirty khakis and his dark little pal , about thirty yards from the car . Lathrop considered squealing out of there . He pictured himself slamming the car into gear , skidding in the gravel , spinning around to face the music . They 'd he on him in a flash . He could feel his heart hammer from his knees to his shoulders , but that was something he was used to . It was just that kind of heart . He wondered if the little one could have been hiding , crouched down on the embankment while the big one fished for suckers on the road . Standing there alone he had looked tame and luckless , a sight that stirred some brotherly impulse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regretting that impulse would obliterate whatever merit attached to respecting the code of desert travelers , a code Lathrop often savored and endorsed while driving alone on the Interstate : one does not leave another to the mercy of the sun . But this was not the season for dying in the desert  --  the day was cool and cloudy , the etiquette of survival did not apply . Lathrop knew he would never have stopped if he 'd noticed there were two of them . The size of his convertible would have been reasonenough to go on . Now , sitting in the idling car with the top down , with the runners drawing closer , closing in , he felt absurdly open to attack . He was helpless as a child alongside a standing person ; he was tempted to leap out . But then he saw how that would startle and provoke them . They would look at him and wonder : what 's he standing up for ? Disadvantaged in his bucket seat , Lathrop gave his windburned face a delicate massage . The authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice on the long-distance phone , hear himself spooning out consolation . He would take her to the movies . He would take her through the children 's arcade of the Circus Circus casino . If only he 'd kept his word to her , the car would have been crammed with brand-new camping gear . He would n't have been able to stop . Grinning and breathless , the hitchhikers bounded up to the car . Lathrop 's heart pumped harder when he saw them at close range . The big one 's chin was slick with drool , and his shirt had been stripped of its buttons . The little one was almost a dwarf , too small to be sane , a Starkwcather type , Lathrop thought . His eyes took the measure of driver and car without a hint of greeting . The big one got the back seat loaded . the car commandeered . " Back off ! " Lathrop screamed inside his skull . He could see the frightened road tramps go facedown in the gravel , himself slinging their satchels out on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one already had the door open and was reaching a bandaged hand across , wrist cocked for a brotherhood shake . Lathrop shook . He said , - Hi , " in a voice that sounded choked and foreign , the result of a mild form of emphysema that , in this circumstance , happened to sound a lot like fear . But it was only that his throat closed up when he went a while without speaking , and he had n't spoken a word for 200 miles , not since ordering his coffee at Ida 's that morning . Of course there was no use explaining that to these two . He felt a pang for Ida 's and was stampeded by fresh premonitions . Clearing his throat , he said , " Hi , " again , this time much more stoutly . " How far you goin ' ? " the little one asked . In sudden alarm Lathrop noticed a tattoo across the knuckles of the little one 's right hand . He had seen exactly this tattoo on the hands of Robert Mitchum in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss it on The Tonight Show . LOVE on the right hand , HATE on the left . Lathrop was fully on the alert now . He was in a state beyond simple fear . While trying to think of a likely destination discouragingly close by , he stayed poised for a glimpse of the HATE hand . Then it struck him that his radio was playing far too loud for the desert stillness . Turning it down , searching for a clearer station , he could give himself precious seconds . He made rapid calculations . l le was four , maybe five hours cast of Hollywood on Interstate Fifteen , still in California . still in the Mojave . But try as he did he could not remember if he 'd already passed Zzyzx Road or the Death Valley turnoff at Baker . Beyond Baker , as far as he recalled , there was nothing all the way to Vegas except a last-chance casino just across the line , the place where the . Bonnie-and-Clyde death car was displayed . But what did they call it ? And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easing himself into the cramped back seat . Lathrop stopped fiddling with the radio and turned in his seat , as if to offer assistance . The index finger of the HATE hand was marked with a crudely drawn H , but the other three looked bare . " I 'm going to Las Vegas , " Lathrop announced , adding an unwise smile . Time had run out on him . The gun had sounded , ending the game . He felt weakened and imperiled not to have a better idea of his whereabouts . He was always raving about how much he loved the desert , and driving across it in a trance . Passing Baker only meant that the drive was two-thirds done  --  he had often sailed past that franchised oasis without registering any break in the solitudinous plain , but it disturbed him that he 'd failed to notice Zzyzx Road . More bad karma . He knew from his reading that the Manson family had sometimes bivouacked there , that Susan Atkins had named her first-born son , the fruit of Manson 's love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverie , causing him to dwell on the baby 's name for many desert miles . Naturally , there were those among his friends who found his fascination with these matters " weird " or amusing , hut no one could deny that if he 'd only been thinking of Manson , he would never have stopped for Starkweather . L ATHROP SURVEYED the landscape . To his left an expanse of cracked ocher abandonment , lacking a horizon . To his right more Mojave , pissed-upon playa , a place without markings or names . Ahead were the roadside quarries . On an outing many years before he had talked his ex-wife into believing that the quarries were mascara mines . Even now he could n't help savoring for a moment the gullibility of that woman . But he also sighed in regret for never having learned what they really were there for . He had driven this road a hundred times . How could he account for his ignorance of everything it traversed ? Getting the car in gear , starting up the shoulder , swinging out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lathrop 's morale . He was in control of the convertible . If they shot him he would crash . He noticed some trees of the spindly kind whose limbs seem engaged in mocking gestures . Howdy , sucker . Up yours . Yucca or Joshua , Lathrop thought , not knowing which to call them . He was almost certain , though , that these trees grew only at high elevations . Higher than creosote , than crucifixion thorn . If this was so , if these trees were actually yucca , then he was still a good distance from the Nevada line . " Aw raht ! " the little one shouted as the car gathered speed . The hoodlums exchanged smiles . " My name 's Dave , " the big one hollered in Lathrop 's ear . " Mine 's Steve , " said Lathrop , succeeding at last in lying . The little one said nothing . Lathrop turned the radio up to assist the wind in impairing conversation . Johnny Cash , or someone unashamedly like him . Now he had time to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and H. A possible Indian . Six-foot-four , 300 pounds , sandy hair , bandaged hand , filthy clothes , front tooth missing . Dave . Two fine-looking orphan makers . There was something psychopathic in these Mutt-and-Jeff pairings . My name 's Charlie , and this here 's Tex . They were partnerships of defects , mutant compromises . Lathrop wondered how these two had joined up , what Dave 's real name was . Dave was running his injured fingers over Lathrop 's walnut veneer dashboard . " Cool car ! " he screamed . " How much it cost ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't remember , " Lathrop said , intending to be evasive . But as soon as the words were spoken he saw how they could n't help but incite a person like Dave . Or Shorty . This fag do n't give a shit , they would reason . He must have money up the ass . " I borrowed it from a friend , " Lathrop explained , missing no more than a beat . " I forget what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tonight in Vegas . I 'll ask . " Dave twisted around and grinned back at his partner . Ai n't this the life ? I 'll ask . What was that supposed to mean ? That he 'd meet them tomorrow with the Blue Book figures on the car ? Lathrop felt himself getting in deeper every time he spoke . It was bad enough to tell them he was headed for Vegas and then grin like someone secretly bound for Phoenix or Salt Lake . But to come on like an overpriced sales clerk , to say I 'm afraid I do n't remember that kind of talk would only justify whatever crime was coming . In their minds . They would leave him in the desert bleeding from the ears and drive off glad to have settled an old score with some fifth-grade teacher . Now he was passing the quarries , losing sight of the only thing he knew . Against the empty " This was not the basin land the weathered diggings looked more than ever like pits for the mining of shadows . Lathrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . A cocktail waitress in Vegas . More or less a whore . Ile was ashamed to have his daughter growing up in that rotten atmosphere . Little girl . What kind of place was Vegas for a little girl ? He was sorry to have been the one who introduced her to the Circus Circus . He wished again that he 'd at least bought the camping gear to show her his good intentions . His thoughts fluttered around to a counting of familiar things . Ida 's , the mascara mines , The Tonight Show , Baker . A hundred years ago Baker was on the line of march for the twenty-mule teams bringing borax out of Death Valley . Lathrop embraced his possession of this knowledge , remembered from a radio serial heard thirty-five years before . Steering down the die-straight road , he pictured himself as a child . " How 'd you like a set of wheels like this , Dave ? " the runt shouted past Lathrop 's ear . Dave made a primitive circle of forefinger and thumb . Then both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled , affecting a comic black accent . " Aw raht ! " came the answer from the rear . Followed by more laughter . So now they were passing signals in their private code . They were into their prison-yard soul-brother act . It was common knowledge that white criminals often assumed black accents on the verge of a violent crime , as if pretended blackness gave them the rights of piracy . We hed to waste the muthah . Ned ta hit him upside a head . After they dumped him they would employ the same fake accent to make fun of the way he died . " Hey , no shit , man , this really is a sharp car , man , " Dave shouted . He was all slobber and sincerity now , desert-eyed , stupid . Fat Boy would have to do better than that to pull Lathrop off his guard . " Yeah , we 's laughin ' at somethin ' else , man , " the little one said , cupping the LOVE hand close to Lathrop 's ear . " We been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyhow . " " All last night and all this morning , too , " Dave yelled into the wind and music . " Lucky we had us some oranges , man , ' cause we spent all our money in Berdoo . " " We 's real happy when we seen you stoppid , man . " the little one said with a cloying inflection that made Lathrop fear for the back of his neck . " Raht own ! " Dave hollered . And again they started to laugh . L ATHROP SENSED that the time had come to end this cat-and-mouse game . It was time to take the initiative , to give them what they wanted while he could . " Look , you guys , just take the car , " he practiced saying . " Let me pull over here and get out . It 's my friend 's car anyhow . He do n't give a shit . " But that would n't be good enough . They would want his money too . He would give it to them , gladly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money . Of course they would never believe that $40 was all he was taking to Vegas . It would n't matter that the money was meant for his daughter . They would rip his wallet open , find out that his name was n't Steve . They would tear through his papers and clothes in anger and disappointment . His panic would drive them on . And when they finally killed him they 'd have no idea at all of what they were taking from this earth . A resurgent love of the desert rose up in him , restoring his place in the emptiness . He could understand and forgive his inattention to its details in light of the value he placed on its vastness and desolation . He did n't have to know what grew and lived there to recognize its perfection as a place to die . Sentimental clutter swam across his eyes , causing him to doubt the overpass when he saw it shimmering far down the road . He had to bat his eyes against memories as well as mirages . His inexhaustible heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough to see that it was a real overpass leading to a real foodand-gas plaza , he had to struggle to contain a whimper of relief . Gracefully , imperceptibly , the happy Catholic swung into the right-hand lane . In the mirror lie could see the little one chewing his nails , brow furrowed in concentration . Dave appeared to be getting drowsy . " How about some coffee ? " Lathrop asked with an emphysematous warble as he shot into the exit . The deft maneuver gave no one a choice in the matter  --  he was steering hard to get in sight of other humans before the killers could gather their wits . He saw them exchange a look , establish a new conspiracy . But by then he was gliding up to the ramparts of the coffee shop . From its gold-and-orange facade , he knew it to be one of the Snooky 's chain . He had passed it a hundred times without stopping . Dave and Shorty scrambled out after him . Dave yawned , stretched , and said something nice about the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chest-high counter where a couple of grandmothers stood . Effusive and polite , Lathrop ordered coffee and doughnuts for the three of them . " What kind of work you do ? " Shorty asked as soon as they were settled . His chin was close to the table for slurping . Lathrop observed that the three bare fingers of the HATE hand were clouded over with scars . " I 'm a lawyer for the public defender 's office , " he said . He had rehearsed the answer many miles down the road , and it came off without a hitch . " I 'm going to Vegas for a Nevada sheriffs ' convention . Fin giving a talk on your rights when you get arrested . Later on tonight . " The little one seemed to shrink still smaller at this news , as if measuring the fury of the sheriffs if their after-dinner speaker did n't show . But Dave could n't hide his dumb-cluck 's luck at meeting an off-duty people 's lawyer . " No . shit ! " he said . " Wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon he was babbling freely about how the cops had deprived him of his rights in Yuba City , how they 'd set the hail too high for his father to pay ? " for fuckin ' larceny , man " ? how he 'd been in jail with Juan Corona , how Corona was a far-out dude . Lathrop enjoyed fresh infusions of confidence as Dave rattled on . Behind a mask of total calm he rejoiced at the swiftness of his mind . The difference between him and the kind of people who get themselves murdered , he reflected , was that he understood the importance of brushing up against the beast now and then . That was why he 'd picked these clowns up in the first place . He could twist their thoughts and fears around until there was no way they could harm him . When Dave started quizzing him about his work , Lathrop displayed a professional 's bored amusement with the details of his trade while never losing sight of his profound concern for the rights of doh n-and-outers- . Like you guys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the public defender 's office . But then the little one seemed to bristle . He stared hard at Dave and worked his rodent jaw . " Dave , man , that whole trip 's bullshit , man , " he said from behind his screen of fingers . " When the fuck you gon na figure it out ? You 're out on the road without a nickel in your pocket and the lawyer goes by in his convertible . I mean it 's nothin ' against you , mister , but Jesus ! It 's the same goddam deal , ai n't it ? Wise fuckin ' up ! " Lathrop was quick to rally . " I can see what you 're trying to say ... " he began . But his admissions that the system was in many ways unjust only reminded Dave of whose side he was on . Soon the two of them were exchanging outlaw encouragements . Nobody gon na give you dick , Jack ! If you want it , git down and git it ! Raht own ! There was further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser killers in the Santa Cruz area whom Dave particularly admired . Lathrop listened for every nuance in this conversation , trying to decide between two interpretations : either they trusted him enough to confidetheir worst criminal ambitions , or else they were stupid enough to kill him , after all . If he tried to make a break now the showdown would come in the parking lot . He could picture the grandmothers clucking over his corpse . There was only one way to test the killers ' intentions without leaving the sanctuary of Snooky 's . Lathrop excused himself and strolled across the room , passing through the franchised highway gift shop . Boulder Dam and Death Valley decals , comb-and-dolly sets , something for his daughter . But no . He remembered the sheriffs ' convention and moved on . Turning to enter the men 's room , he glanced back at the table . Dave was coming through the gift shop after him . Lathrop locked himself inside the only stall . The door left his feet and ankles vulnerable . Dave was tall enough to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer door and began making hydraulic noises . Lathrop cased a sheet of paper off the toilet roll . His heart was a mighty machine . Never mind . " I am with 2 hitchhikers , " he wrote , tearing the fragile paper with his pen and staining his pants at the knee . " I think they mean to harm me . Please call State Patrol . I am in canary yellow convert Calif lie AQR 953 . Headed for Vegas . Thanks . " He scratched out the word " canary , " folded the message into a small square . and fitted it under his watch strap . Dave still lingered outside the stall . He had turned the water on and was letting it run . Lathrop steadied his nerves . Take it easy . Lighten up . He spun the roll of paper as loud as it would go , flushed the toilet , stood , and did a hitching-the-pants-up shuffle . Then he opened the door and stepped out . Dave was pretending to wash his damaged fingers . Lathrop came back through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber window shades he saw the little one out in the parking lot , examining the convertible . He hurried over to the table , snatched up the check , then moved hack across to the cash register , choosing a path that cut Dave off at the revolving postcard trees . A teen-aged boy sat behind the counter with a textbook in his lap . He barely looked up as Lathrop approached , digging under his watch strap . Lathrop felt at once that he could place absolute trust in this intelligent student . He slipped the message between the check and a $5 hill and casually handed it over . Dave was belly-up against the counter now , apparently shoplifting an after-dinner mint . But from the vacant aura he projected Lathrop could tell that he had n't seen a thing . The cashier 's eyes seemed to flash a silent alarm when his fingers touched the emergency sandwich . " Thank you , sir , " he told Lathrop as he handed him his change . The very nonchalance of his manner convinced Lathrop that the call was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the high-way patrol a pretext for pulling him over . He drove seventy , then seventy-five . He drove long enough and fast enough to begin worrying about crossing the Nevada line before the police could get organized . Tumbleweeds skimmed past at seventy . Creosote . Crucifixion thorn . Lathrop pictured himself camping in the desert with his daughter , building a fire inside a small circle of stones . Flames danced in reflection on a brand-new nylon tent . Then , in the mirror , Lathrop caught sight of a black-and-white car a half-mile behind him . The next time he looked there were two . His heart went into an impetuous fandango ; that did n't prove a thing . He checked again in the mirror . The police were keeping their distance . He did n't understand why they were hanging back , why there had to be two of them . He did n't dare to think how long it would be before the little one saw them also . Starkweather had rearranged his perch in the back so that Lathrop could n't watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and was hack to fingering the dashboard , seeing how everything worked . What would happenwhen the police made their move ? What could he do with Starkweather 's automatic in the back of his neck and Dave 's gorilla foot jammed over his on the gas pedal ? Humiliation spilled over him . lie realized with deathly clarity that calling the police had been a colossal blunder , a self-destructive move no different from picking up the killers in the first place . On his own , he might have been able to talk his way out of trouble , but with the police involved the danger was much greater . A heavy sigh escaped him as he faced the inevitable shoot-out . He pictured his pitying friends . Poor Lathrop  --  he wrote his suicide note on toilet paper . Down the road , a mile distant , Lathrop saw another highway patrol car cut across the grass divider . He was doing almost eighty when he shot past the waiting cruiser . Chemicals entered his bloodstream , making him ready to receive the bullets . His heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed . All three cruisers came abreast of him . " Hey , what the fuck ! " the little one shouted just before the bullhorn spoke . " Stop your aehicte . Leave the roadway . Stop your vehicle at once . " The three cars had him pinned . They were edging him toward the shoulder . A shotgun protruded from the rear window of the car closest to him . Lathrop had to wrestle the wheel for control " Do not move . Remain in sight . Keep your hands in sight . Do not attempt to leave the vehicle . " Police cars skidded up at all angles . Doors flew open . Red and blue lights snapped around in the afternoon sun . Guns and helmets emerged . " First you , next to the driver . Out of the car . Hands in the air . Move ! Down on your stomach . Hands behind the head . Now you , in the back . A sergeant approached the convertible , holding his heavy pistol in both hands . Lathrop was heaving at the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravel . Someone was slinging their satchels out on the shoulder . " Do you want these men arrested , sir ? " the sergeant said , lowering his pistol . " No , no , " said Lathrop , struggling to produce an urgent whisper . " Do n't call me ' sir . ' Treat me like them . Take me back to your car and I 'll explain it . " " Okay , on your feet , " the sergeant said , failing to convince . Lathrop hoped that Dave and Shorty could n't hear . He wished the sergeant would raise his pistol to make it look more real . He rose from the car with his hands up and walked to the farthest cruiser . Giddiness overcame him . his mind spun around to Manson 's desert busts . He wondered what the passing motorists would make of him . what they would think of this remarkable tableau . Back in the police car he explained about the LOVE and HATE tattoos , the way they 'd talked in black accents and overpraised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sergeant seemed to understand . " Where 'd you pick them up , sir ? " he asked . Lathrop did n't want to risk describing the mascara mines without knowing what they were there for . " Back around Zzyzx Road , " he said . Through the windshield he could see two patrolmen poking through the hitchhikers ' belongings while a third stood over them with a shotgun . Lathrop knew no weapons would be found . The police relaxed their guard after the search was completed . A call was put through to check on everyone 's record . Dave and Shorty looked worried . They stood at the edge of the shoulder tossing rocks at bottles and cans . Lathrop glided up and joined them in the prison-yard pastime . " What 's going down , man ? " Shorty asked in a confidential tone . They did n't suspect him ! Quite the contrary , the bust had been a kind of initiation that made them temporary equals . In their minds . Lathrop felt a surge of pleasure at being there with them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is the car okay ? " " Oh , sure . Sure . I think somebody back at the cafe called . They must have overheard us talking or something like that . " " Shoe ! We figured it had to be the car for that kind of bust like that . We thought you was probably hullshittin ' about your friend . Who lends anybody a car like that ? " Shorty sailed a rock into the culvert and broke another bottle , his second in a row . Dave was searching for bigger and bigger rocks , drooling at the effort . " Which of you guys is Jimmy Dale Evans ? " the sergeant asked , approaching them . He had Dave and Shorty 's wallets fastened to his clip-board- " Over here , " the little one said . " Looks like you been missing some meetings with your parole officer , little Jim . last three in a row . " " I been lookin ' for work , man , " Jimmy Dale said with a ferocity Lathrop envied . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . He was stricken with remorse for having caused the poor bastard this new brush with the law . He glared at the sergeant for calling him " little Jim . " " I 'm not taking you into custody , " the sergeant said , " but I 'm telling you now that your parole officer will be advised that we 've stopped you . If he wants to do something about it , that 's his business . Understood ? " He handed Jimmy Dale his wallet . Jimmy took it with the HATE hand . Dave grinned moronically as the sergeant turned his way . " Looks like you better watch what kind of company you 're keeping , David . David Clyde Brown ? That it ? " Dave nodded and grinned . Lathrop was stung to discover that Dave was his real name . He wished the sergeant had his wallet , too , had some rough words , something to erase the unrecoverable distance between him and the two friends . " You do n't have to stay any longer , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokers here while you get started . " " Oh , no , man , " Lathrop said . The words hung in the air as if spoken in enemy dialect . " I do n't mind giving them a ride the rest of the way . They 're headed for Vegas , same as me . " " Suit yourself , " the sergeant said . Lathrop helped Dave and Jimmy get their satchels loaded . Without a suspicion of weapons inside , they felt pathetically light . Lathrop reminded himself that Dave and Jimmy were criminal types , but now that the police had everyone 's name he knew he was in no danger . There was no way they could touch him now . The ride to Vegas was the least he owed them for having brought on this roadside humiliation . By the time the car was loaded , the last of the cruisers was gone . Once they were rolling again , Lathrop explained how one of the grandmothers must have heard them talking about Manson and Corona . " I guess she must have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added with an indulgent chuckle . " Stupid bitch ! " Dave hollered . " We would n't of let you stop at the fuckin ' cafe or go back to the men 's room like that if we 's plannin ' anything , would we , Jimmy ? " Little Jim did not say . A few minutes later they were over the state line , passing the Bonnie-and-Clyde death car . - Raht own ! " Dave was yelling . " Ah raht ! " said the voice from the rear . Lathrop marveled at the simplemindedness of his passengers . How could they possibly plan their crimes ? He decided not to bother telling his ex-wife about the afternoon 's events . She would never believe how well his intuition had served hint . He 'd explain his late arrival some other way , or else say nothing at all . It would still be warm enough to take his daughter riding with the top down . They 'd find a movie . He 'd buy popcorn , Cokes , whatever else she wanted . He would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the way to Vegas . When he passed the Circus Circus , Jimmy and Dave got out . ?
