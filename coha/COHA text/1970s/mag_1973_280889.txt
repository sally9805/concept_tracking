Nominated last January by President Nixon to become Solicitor General in June , Robert Bork grew more and more impatient to get to Washington . He had taught at Yale Law School for more than a decade , and Washington , he told friends , was " going to be pure pleasure . " It would offer " a lot of intellectual fascination . " Last week was indeed a fascinating one for Bork . Having been catapulted into the position of Acting Attorney General as a result of the Cox affair , the professor who came to Washington to gain firsthand knowledge of the Supreme Court found himself at the center of a political storm . It was Bork who fired Cox on Nixon 's orders , and it was Bork who was given the all but impossible job of finding a successor satisfactory to the President , the Congress and the public . <P> The Acting Attorney General is no stranger to controversy . In an institution dominated by liberals , Bork was proud to be known as the most conservative member of the law-school faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he supported the President in both the 1968 and 1972 elections and helped prepare the constitutional case for Nixon 's antibusing proposals in 1972 . As the Government 's chief advocate in cases before the Supreme Court , Solicitor General Bork promised to follow existing policy . <P> Bork says that he agreed to fire Cox , after Elliot Richardson and his former deputy William Ruckelshaus refused , because " I believe a President has the right to discharge any member of the Executive branch . " At first he thought that he should tender his own resignation after carrying out the order , as proof that he was not merely clearing his own way to a better job . Richardson urged Bork to stay on " to keep the department running , " but Bork has made it plain that he has no desire to make his arrangement permanent . The post no longer looks inviting " after the last several days , " he said at a press conference last week , his sporty red beard dripping with perspiration . To underscore that feeling , Bork has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Attorney General 's more sumptuous quarters and his official limousine . The professor from New Haven continues to drive himself to work in his 1968 Volvo .
