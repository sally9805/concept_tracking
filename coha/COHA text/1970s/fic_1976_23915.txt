CORRIDA A story by Patricia Duncan HE HAD BEEN PROBING her teeth with her tongue for nearly an hour , and he decided he could n't take it any longer . Over the slopes and crevices of her molars , lingering around her incisors , sliding across the gums . Christ , her tongue must he bleeding by now , he thought , for the tip of his own burned . But she went on licking every tooth , over and over , stopping between the front two at each sweep to make a tiny click . And clicking , she almost smiled . And began again . Yet he could n't say anything , for then the fact that they both spoke English would be confirmed . Three words ? " Cut that out " ? would be plenty , and the absurd compulsion to add more words would come and there they would be : pretending that the same universal boring crap held any more significance because the sounds were familiar . Naturally she would be American . The kerchiefed head , the Pan Am stickers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trainload of Spaniards with one other American , naturally you 'd end up with the American . Those were the odds , he decided , just as when your cigarettes are in one of two pockets you 'll reach into the wrong one no matter how hard you try to remember which is which ; reversing your first impulse does nut help . Given a 50-50 chance , you pick the wrong one every time . So , he thought , it only follows that if you come to a foreign place to he foreign , to be silent , you will invariably end up with one of your own breed . He did n't want to look at her or hear her slurping . But lie did , because her pale blue eyes , sparsely lashed , basically utilitarian eyes without a glint or fleck of gray , were fixed on a limbo between ashtray and window , glaring . Preoccupied , he thought . Which made it worse because that meant there was a story to be told . I will not say a word , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to Spain ? it would begin . Then the establishment of home states and the bit about , " yes , I 've been through there , lovely winters , " and the ensuing revelations about jobs , families , pets . That would fill up the space between Tarragona and Tortosa , interspersed , of course , with a few silent stares into the Mediterranean , those token stares insisting that , " yes , is n't the sea beautiful and is n't this exciting ? " Exciting . And all that to get her to stop swabbing her teeth . Her image reflected on the window , still except for the mouth movement , a face stuck on the glass . neckless . And when they passed the flat , decapitated mountains her head perched perfectly on top , an insane Mount Rushmore , clicking . " Cut that out , " he blurted . She did . " Sorry , " she murmured . He could have done without the unnecessary word and the look she gave him , a look he took to mean " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lasts a quarter of a second too long , then flits away . He wondered what made him endlessly analyze and why the aggravations had been accumulating like a layer of rust all over , coating even the inside of his mouth , the backs of his eyes . He watched her skin on the glass , how it slid over the bone , barely covered it . How easy to start at the top of her head , just below that ridiculous plaid bandanna , and gently peel the skin off in one stroke , laying it across the leather seat to dry . H E DECIDED HE 'D better move around . Go to the toilet . Getting up , be kicked over her straw purse ; two oranges rolled out . She let them roll to a stop , then slowly bent over , dropping a fist then uncurling the fingers and reaching for the first orange , lazily , liquidly . He quickly picked up the second orange and threw it into her bag while she hung over the seat , her hair wisping against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , bent stiffly at the elbows . How easily a pair of shears would snip them . The hair , too . Shorn and left lying between the grooves of the floor near the cigarette butts , the wads of gum . He went to the toilet . Once inside , he pounded the walls , because they could at least try aiming . Even with the movement of the train , you could expect some control , could n't you ? A firmer grip , a little concentration maybe . But no . There were circles of piss on the floor that seemed to foam at the edges , splashes of it on the door , piss graffiti on the walls . Spanish piss . Yellower , a different smell , with a nastier bite that made you control your " What a blob she breathing . He stood leaning against the wall taking tiny breaths that had nothing to do with lungs or air really , just a habit . I really must do something about this rust , he thought . To be flayed , cleaned like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potato 's eyes . But it would take so long . Thirty-five years ' worth . Noticed gradually  --  no , noticed in a day . Bain . Go away . You know no Spanish , so go to Spain . You do n't want to do anything , so sit on a train . Sitting may become your occupation , your only obligation . To the Spaniard waiting outside the toilet , he said , " Try aiming at least , goddamn it , " and shoved his way through the puffs of black tobacco to his compartment . Her tongue stopped in mid-rotation when he sat down . She stretched across the seat and slowly pulled the scarf from her head , flinging it onto the floor . Dropping her foot from the seat , she prodded the scarf into the grooves . He noticed her notice him . " it 's ugly , " she explained , flicking a finger at the little heap of cotton now Fudged with ashes . " I hate shit like that . " " Why do you wear it , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't wanted to ask , but you have to . do n't you ? People expect such things out of life . They figure you do n't get the big things so you must oblige with the little ones . Which turn into big ones . Morally , he was compelled to ask that question . She said nothing , just looked at that space between ashtray and window . " Why do you wear it , then ? " he repeated . She looked now at her sandaled foot , an ugly foot , he decided , short and fat . not at all like the rest of her , a Hobbit 's foot with a heel like a pincushion . She did n't answer . Maybe he 'd figured her wrong . She was supposed to say something like " I have a scalp disease " or " My husband gave it to me and he died yesterday so I 'm wearing it in memoriam . " She obviously did n't know anything about question/response or the values in life . Or maybe she was beyond him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe she just no longer bothered . But , God , what a purge it must have been , for she wilted in her seat , drooping her head , those lusterless eyes staring at that ridiculous place ; a few nuts and screws were what she found so consuming , a handful of hardware , for God 's sake . In the glass , her face floated past the olive trees which sprang from their poor soil , no minerals , no vitamins , dry crisp things with their pale , lovely leaves . And from that dry-ness came such an oily fruit  --  rich , meaty . Now , maybe that was something to say . Yes , remark on the olive trees . From there move on to the almond trees , the peach trees , the palms . But surely she knew nothing about them , absorbed as she was with the screws . Her lips were tilted in a way that made one tooth protrude , and whether it was a pensive tilt or something that happened without her knowing he could n't tell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , closing her eyes . " So do n't ask . " " Was n't about to . " " Hell , you think you 've been staring at me in that window enough ? " " The olive trees . " " Bullshit . " p LUCKING HER EYELASHES would n't be a bad idea , he thought . Really strip her down . The fingernails could go , too . Perceptive bitch . Nonchalance supreme . Lounging on her seat as if it were her living room and no one else was around . Legs sprawled . Yawns so big you could see her tonsils . Private sighs , long but stilted , cut short . A button near her navel undone , a visible fold of flesh and to the side a few stretch marks like razor scars . Yes , with a razor blade inserted between skin and rust , just so , you could chip it away . Could n't you ? Preoccupied , she slowly raised an eyebrow , let it drop . An image of her in the bedroom flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie waiting in bed as she stepped out of her skirt and tossed it , on the windowsill maybe , in the trash can perhaps . Five minutes later she would unbutton her blouse , running a finger from throat to stomach , absently scratching a breast . She 'd pull a brush through half her hair and then drop it somewhere , near her foot maybe , which she would bend over to peruse , noticing the way the toes nestled in a clump . And finally , turning to glance around the room , she 'd see the lover waiting , and a look would come over her face like " Oh , yes , that 's what I was going to do . " How she would go to the man , he did n't know . How her body would bend , what that persistent tongue might do , how her fingers would curl and uncurl. looking at her now , wan and inert , how could you tell ? Christ , she annoys me , he thought . Just lying there . Past the Roman castles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , past the gusts of tobacco and the man wheeling the beer-andmineral-water cart down the aisle , past all this : just lying there . He felt the energy coming on , in his wrists for some reason , then his hands . To pull her hair , he thought , yes , or to pull that silver mess of dangling things from her pierced car , the right ear , the closest ear . To make her jump , dart her eyes , shriek . To slice her thigh . To make her move . She sifted through her purse . An eyeglass case emerged , then some sort of ticket which she glared at , arching her brows . She tossed it in the air and watched it flutter into a blob of phlegm on the floor . She withdrew a bent photo from the bottom of her bag , wiped some powder from it , blew on it , yawned . Sinking back once more into her languid corpse position , she squinted at the picture , alternately clicking her tongue , fingering her brow . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mused , to really lay her back , bringing on that pallid inertia full force . But then she would probably need no forcing ; there would be no pinning of arms behind the head or prying lips open or grabbing that pioneering tongue . No , she would take the bottle , glance at the label , shrug , down the pills . And just lie there . " My kid , " she murmured , waving the picture once then letting it fall , loosely fastened between two fingers , to her chest . " Trying to remember her . " " So it 's been a long time ? " he asked . Those goddamn questions on the rebound . If a ball flies at you , do n't you have to catch it ? No , much better to dodge it , let it fall , forget it . " Suppose so , " her mouth moved . God , how out of it can you be , he wondered , merely to suppose so ? What a blob she was . Surely if the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splats to the floor , running between the grooves , coagulating with the spots of Spanish phlegm , dark and bubbly . And then to haul in a fire hose , a simple solution , and wash the place down , get rid of it all . He felt electricity in his left arm that ignited his heart , or lung , a place around there ; the thump-thump of blood and aggravation made him sit on his hands . For the moment , he knew he was contained within the thirty-five years of rust , covered over with the flakes and barnacles of living that forced you to check all outrageous impulses . Outrageous ? He sat on his hands and enjoyed the pain of the tiger 's eye pressed against his knuckle , glaring . But , God , to suppose so . " So how long has it been ? Five years ? Two ? Do you know ? " He watched her closed-eyed face in the window , hanging between the passing mules , the plows , the white buildings . The brown of this place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she certainly did n't know or care . And neither did he really ; all he wanted were strange sounds , something anonymous and reassuring with the virtues of distance and unreality . But there was that obstacle of a common language which carried with it some unavoidable obligation . " Damn it , how Iong ? " " Three years . " " Thank you , She handed him the photo . Black and white . A girl , about three , holding a Sinai ! shovel , wearing a sunsuit with one shoulder untied . Typical . Except for the tilted lips . And the way the picture had been creased down the middle so that a line chopped the girl in two , misplacing her nose , scarring her naked little throat . " Nice eyes , " he remarked , although they looked quite ordinary . " Her father 's ? " At this , the woman glanced up , clearing her vision to take him in , staring in a way that changed her eyes , deepened the blue . It was not a pleasant look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he decided , in her something as rare . " Mine , " she answered . " They 're obviously mine . " " Oh , are they ? Hmm , had n't noticed . " " Take a look , then . " He looked . Such totally unadorned eyes . Iris , retina , pupil , nothing more . But as he watched them , they seemed to enlarge , even brighten , and he noticed that she had leaned forward , actually moved . She tapped her foot . " Well , I do n't know . If you say so , " he said , handing her the picture . " Yeah , I do say so . Look again . They 're mine , not his . " Hell , it had only been a ploy . Of course the drab eyes were hers , but he just wanted to get a rise out of her , never expecting it to happen . He leaned back , crossed his legs , smiled . " Now , the nose , " she said , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't make out the nose . Somebody folded it . " " Yeah , me . " " Well , let me see . " He scrutinized the picture again . God , it was a hell of a nose , like a huge pear . " Not a bad nose , really , not bad at all . " She snatched the picture from him . Startled , he looked up to see her squinting furiously at the wrinkled little image . " It 's a lousy nose , " she told him . " Yes , well . " " Well , what ? " " What 's she doing in Spain ? " The woman fluttered her wrist as if to say , " What possible difference does that make ? " " Does she live with her father ? " he asked . " So I hear . " So she heard . She supposed so . A true blob . And yet she now sat on the edge of her seat , her legs crossed tightly , her spine straight . She touched an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deepened the blue of her eyes . And somehow he felt calmer . The scent of Spanish piss still drifted in and out , and there was that glimmer of electricity at the back of his neck , yet he felt better . To see her jiggling her fat foot . To see her erect , waiting . " May I have one of your oranges ? " he suddenly asked . " Sure , go ahead . " He picked up the straw bag , fumbling through uncapped pens , a dirty comb , gum wrappers . Such garbage , he thought . He took an orange , broke the skin with his teeth , and began peeling . Peeling was the thing , not eating it . Pulling the thick hide off , feeling the helpless little sprays of juice and that soft white that caught beneath the nails : these were the reasons for oranges . Her eyes followed his fingers with a concentration that surprised him , back and forth , intensely focusing as he halted in the middle of a rip , waiting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you like one ? " he asked . She nodded quickly , reaching for her bag . But he lifted it to his lap . " Here , " he said . " A large one . " She held out her hand . " You 're sure you want one ? " he asked . " What ? " She tilted her head , pushed back her hair . " Yeah . sure . give me one . " He held out the orange . Her hand went for it . He pulled it back . " What are you doing ? Just give me the orange , " she said , attempting a flickering smile . " You 're sure it 's the orange you want ? " " What ? " " You do n't actually want to eat it , do you ? " " Of course I want to eat it . Why else would want it ? " " To peel it . Mess it up . Ruin it . " " Just give it to me . " He held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The orange fell into his lap . He smiled . " Just give me the fucking orange , " she hissed , her face reddening . Now , he thought , she is obviously unsettled . Look at her . The tapping toes . That something invading the barren eyes . Blue . The teeth cutting into the lower lip . And there , beneath her blouse , the quick up-down of lungs and heart . " Take it , " he shrugged . She reached into his lap , but he caught her arm . A thin wrist , the kind that one clench might snap . " What 's wrong with you ? " she shouted . " You 're a goddamn blob , that 's what . " " Let go , " she said calmly . But he knew she was trying to be calm ; she was really working at it , and with another smile , he tightened his grip . She swung at him with her free hand , a clumsy sweep ; her knuckles collided into the metal partition . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a yell , but a definite raising of the voice , done from the throat and vibrating against the teeth . " There 's the orange , " he said . " Take it . " He loosened his hand from her wrist . She knelt for a moment , startled and white . The picture of her daughter had fallen onto the floor and she stuffed it back into her bag . " Sure they 're really your eyes ? " he asked , and she shuddered , not looking at him . He saw her again in the glass , her smooth bony profile merging with the landscape of rocks and cliffs , eyes downcast as if gazing at the ground from a mountain top , overseeing , seeing nothing . And slowly , with the slightest tremor , her hand moved toward the fruit in his lap . He knocked the orange onto the floor . shuffling Spanish feet stopped . He lay , his face blotched with spit , ash , and blood , listening . He knew she had her guts and diaphragm working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . He knew it was a sight he should not miss . But the sound of it was enough , a high-pitched , unyielding call , the most personal thing he had ever heard , more intimate than the haziest whisper . A beautiful scream , he decided . God , do it again . But instead she sat stiffly , propping her feet on his head . The Spaniards flocked about with rags and water , but she told them , in decent Spanish , to fuck off . They did . The Spaniards are quite emotional , he thought , they understand such things . They remained that way for quite some time . He , breathing into the butts and orange peels , and she , sitting quietly , hands in her lap , feet on his head . " We 're coming into Valencia , " she told him . " You get off here ? " " Yes . " And the train went grinding into the station , and he stumbled up onto the seat , seeing her for the first time : bruised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pointed out the window into a small crowd and there , looking older but just as ordinary and folded in half as before , her kid stood waiting . The woman waved , tapped on the glass , flung her arms . " Maybe you should wash your face or some . thing , " he said . But she was quickly straightening her bag , gathering her things , looking busy , determined . Flushed and lovely , he thought . Well , with a stretch of the imagination , yes . " Are you going to meet her like that ? " he asked . " Maybe you should clean up , do n't you think ? " But no , she balanced her bags , swept back her hair , and left the compartment . A moment later she returned , saying goodbye in a clear voice . She stood still , staring at him , and he thought that perhaps what she did with her mouth was a smile , probably not , that she threw out for grabs . At any rate , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twitch , and she hurried off . He sprawled on the seat , watching her greet the child and give her the other orange ; the girl reached for her mother 's face and delicate . ly stroked a bloody lip . And he wondered : Was it in places like this that such contemporary saviors were found , and did they always travel incognito ? He let out a loud , private sigh , fingered a bit of rust on a screw , and waited to carry on . 0
