' The lawfulness and goodness of an action was to be measured and judged by what was likely to follow from it ' . Though Goodwin maintained that he had said nothing which was not implicit in the works of the Reformers , nay , in Prynne 's Sovereign Power , there was some truth in the accusation that he was ' the first Protestant parson to approve regicide ' . ' For the position which he had assumed was , indeed , a most extreme one . To set the laws of God and Nature above those of man was done by most of those who had taken sides against the king ; but to subject the laws of God to the ' Law of Necessity ' was a novelty in its frank cynicism . Beyond this it was impossible to go . Goodwin , who had before represented the more moderate wing of the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Peters , who repeated with fervour the Nunc Dimittis immediately after the king 's head had fallen$ . A far more powerful advocacy of the new government came from the greatest thinker and writer in the Independent ranks . Any examination of the sources of Milton 's political opinions must begin with his classical studies . Aubrey remarks4 that his republicanism arose from his ' being so conversant in Livy and the Roman authors , and the greatness he saw done by the Roman Commonwealth . ' He may stand therefore as the chief of those whom Hobbes describes as having in their youth read the books ' written by famous men of the ancient Grecian and Roman Commonwealths , concerning their polity and their great actions , in which the popular government was extolled by the glorious // name of Liberty and Monarchy disgraced by the name of tyranny , and who thereby became in love with their forms of government ' . ' In the whole spirit of his political thinking , in his conception of the State as an organism , in his sacrifice of the undistinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical . Of the influence of the Italian republics there is little explicit trace , though a letter to Diodati proves that he attentively studied their historya . It is with Macchiavelli that his acknowledged debt to modern thinkers begins . The great Florentine 's love for ancient Rome may well have attracted Milton 's notice ; and he further gratefully recognised in him the author of the theory that the best government was mixeda . But though in the Commonplace Book we hear more of teachers than of events , the Aragonese formula of coronation , the note that Scotland was originally an elective kingdom , the testimony from Holinshed that the sovereign was not crowned until he had sworn to administer justice , seem to speak already of the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates*. / The importance of the discovery of this work lies in the evidence it provides that Milton 's earliest political views were merely those of liberal constitutionalism ( But the writings which issued from his pen in the years between his return from Italy and the execution of the king seem to foreshadow the rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one series of tracts he pleaded for intellectual and religious liberty , at first against the Church , and , after the fall of the Church , against the Presbyterians . In another , he claimed domestic liberty , in opposition to men of all parties , though supported , as he took . I52 The Foundation of the Republic pains to shew , by some of the Fathers of the Protestant Church . The books proved , not only that the dominant impulse of his life was the achievement of liberty , but that he was bold enough to pursue his way undaunted by the opinion of men . When Milton came forward as a political teacher he was already known as a libertine who would- be tied by no obligation to God or Man ' . ' It is no longer possible to discover at what date the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates was begun . At any rate , the appearance of the pamphlet a fortnight after the king 's execution announced that Milton had attached himself more closely to the Regicides than any other person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ready to have added his signature to the Death-Warrant , we do not find the detestation of monarchy that his later works were to contain . Men were born free , declares Milton , in the image and resemblance of God Himself ; but wrong and violence entering in among them from Adam 's sin , they agreed by common league to bind each other from mutual injury . One or more individuals were selected on account of their wisdom and virtue and entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the community , not as lords but as commissioners . The power remains fundamentally in the people and can not be taken from them without a violation of their birthright . To say that kings are accountable to none but God overturns all law and government ; for if they fear not God , ? and most do- not , ? the people hold their lives and estates by the tenure of their grace and mercy . The people may therefore reject and depose them whenever they // care to do so , by the right of freeborn men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , it is the people 's right to depose a good king , it is their duty to depose a tyrant . If the law of nature allows a man to defend himself even against the king in person , does not it justify much more the self-defence of a whole Comtnonwealth ? If no Protestant nation has yet punished its ruler , it is not because the nation was Protestant but because the king did not deserve punishment . Honour , then , to those who have had courage to set a precedent , who have dared to teach the world that ' for the future no potentate , but to his sorrow , may presume to turn upside down whole kingdoms of men ' . ' ' There are several points to be noticed in this eloquent pamphlet . By his declaration of the original freedom of men and his acceptance of that variety of the social contract theory which retains for the people a power greater than they surrender , Milton belongs decisively to the liberal school of political thought . By his championship of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and what may be described as the positive school . By his adducing the teaching of leading Reformers , he connects his political theory with his Protestantism . By his historical illustrations , he desires to prove that the reason of mankind , whether or no expressed in laws , points in the same direction . And yet there is nothing to denote that he as yet preferred a Republic to any other form of government . He is still able to conceive a king who should not be a tyrant . Further events had to take place before Monarchy is rejected as necessarily incompatible with the liberty which Milton cherishes equally with life itself . The King 's Book had appeared at the same time as Milton 's z 54 The Foundation of the Republic earliest political pamphlet , and , rising on the crest of the great wave of reaction , appeared to the Council of State sufficiently formidable to demand an answer . The Eikonoklastes , accordingly , made its appearance in the autumn of the same year . The greater part of the work closely follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chapter , through the events of the long struggle . Two developments , however , are to be discerned . In the first place , the character of the references to the monarch himself has changed . The glee with which the author traces the plagiarism from the flrcadia and rushes to inferences therefrom , the credulity with which he accepts the story of the king 's murder of his father and of his connection with the Irish massacres , his unfeeling jeer at Charles ' vain request for his chaplains : these and many other passages point to a bitterness that is new . Traces , accordingly , of a less sympathetic attitude towards monarchy in general become visible in this treatise . We learn from both sacred and profane history , ' he remarks in introducing a discussion on Church government , that the kings of this world have both ever hated and instinctively feared the Church of God . ' Kings though strong in legions are but weak in argument , since they have ever been accustomed from their cradle to use their will only as their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' The possibility of a monarch not being a knave or a fool is forgotten . Equally does a second point demand notice . When the Tenure was written , the author believed that the vast majority of the nation took what he regarded as the rational view of the relations of kings and subjects . But the tide was turning while Milton was writing his first book , and was running rapidly while he was engaged on his second . He learned that he had over-estimated the area in which wisdom was to be found , and that he had exaggerated the worth of the The Champions of the New Regime T 55 ' mass of individuals who composed the nation ; and the shadow of disenchantment falls darkly across the pages . The country of free men , each with his birthright , his instinct for freedom , his divine origin and model , has now faded away , and in its place we have an ' inconstant , irrational and hapless herd , begotten to servility , ' enchanted with the device of the king at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English People against Salmasius , the fruit of almost twelve months ' hard work . His opinions have now reached the point where Monarchy itself meets with unqualified rejection . ' You liken a monarchy to the government of the world by one God ! I pray you , answer Inc whether you think any can deserve to be invested with a power here on earth that shall resemble His power that governs the world , except such a person as loth infinitely excel all other men ? ' We find , in the second place , the fullest statement of his conception of the Law of Nature . His opponent having defended his case by an appeal to the teachings of this code , Milton grapples with the whole question ' . It is easy to prove that nothing is more agreeable to the Law of Nature than that punishment should be inflicted on tyrants . For it is a principle imprinted on all men 's minds to regard the good of all mankind . Since , then , it does not regard the private good of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pretend any right to do mischief . Hereditary government is contrary to the Law of Nature ; for nobody has a right to be king unless he excels all others in wisdom and courage . ' ' ' ' rose who reign without these qualifications have climbed to power by force or faction . Nature appoints that wise men should govern fools , not that the wicked should rule over the good ; and those who take the government out of such men 's hands act agreeably to the Law of Nature . // III Among lesser literary champions of the Republic was John Cook , already famous as chief prosecutor of the king and honour-. ably distinguished from his fellow lawyers by the readiness with which he accepted proposals for the reform of the law ' . A few days after the execution of Charles appeared the speech which he had intended to deliver , should the prisoner have pleaded to the charge ' . The work throws an interesting light on the mental attitude of the average regicide . By what law is the king condemned ? Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes the reply , ' By the unanimous consent of all rational men in the world , written in every man 's heart with the pen of a diamond in capital letters . ' That there is no special statute empowering the people to judge and condemn a tyrant is irrelevant ; such a law is no more necessary than one enacting that men should eat and drink . Nay , were there a law specially forbidding such conduct , it would be invalid ; for the Law of Nature not only supplements the laws of men , but overrides them . The application of the rule to the particular case is as indisputable as the rule itself . The community had agreed to offer the king power for the preservation of society , and on his acceptance a mutual trust had been created . On the breach of this trust , . // the penalty which was implicit in the very idea of a contract had been enforced ' . The ' babbling and brazen-faced solicitor , ' as he was designated by Sir Philip Warwick ' , proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the further illustration of these principles . The character of the new work is indicated in its title , Monarchy no creature of God 's making , proving by Scripture and Reason that Monarchical Government is against the mind of God , and that the execution of the late king was one of the fittest sacrifices ' Queen Justice ever had . Unlike its predecessor , it reveals a definitely anti-monarchical position . A good king is a contradiction in terms . One who appears so simply gives the people ' many good words and a few good acts in order to enslave them faster , like those we call good witches that seem to cure one that they may without suspicion bewitch many . ' Cook solemnly announces the Divine disapprobation of monarchy . Parliament put an end to kingship , not out of any affection for change , nor merely for the ease of the people , but because God commanded it to be done4 . No other variety of monarchy than absolutism is presumed possible , and , since God appoints only such government as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monarchy than of sin . If it be objected that kingdoms nevertheless exist , we must reply that , as in the case of evil , they are permitted ' for ends and reasons best known to His Divine Majesty . ' The ground of the erroneous impression that God approves of it is to be found in the habit of ' snatching at the Scriptures , ' reading here a verse and there a verse , instead of taking pains to know the whole mind of God . Presumably on the strength of his proficiency in this exalted science , the author 1 58 The Foundation of the Republic recalls to the memory of his readers the wet summer of 1648 , and declares that it testified to the Lord 's exceeding displeasure with those who would have made peace with the king ' . After such an unmistakeable proclamation of the Divine disapprobation of the government of a Single Person , it is remarkable that Cook should express a directly contrary opinion . What abundance of good , he soliloquises , might one rare incomparable person do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . But he recollects himself almost immediately and adds that such a thought is but worldly wisdom , since the best of men are but men and there is no grace but may be counterfeit . Such power would corrupt the best man living ' . That such a thought should have flashed across the mind of so resolute a republican helps us to understand the welcome that greeted the coup d'etat of two years later . The slip does not recur . When the question arises whether a nation may live happily under a mixed monarchy , the reply is in the negative . Monarchy and Liberty are incompatible . A people must be in total bondage or wholly free , if they would live in quiet . In the same way , a good king is no more possible than a mixed monarchy . An apprentice with a kind master may in a certain way be said to be free ; but , to speak strictly , he remains a servant . Besides , the analogy is merely fanciful . Monarchs are nearly always monsters , born for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorns or figs of thistles ' ? A more reasonable spirit appears in the protest against the notion of ' many godly , honest hearts ' that knowledge was less requisite in a commonwealth than in a monarchy ; whereas learning was not only for a Court , but for the glory of all nations . Equally dangerous was the opinion that every honest man was fit to be // a magistrate or a minister . The discussion of legal reform reaffirms the positions of his earlier pamphlet . Doubtless many formalities and ceremonies deserved to be buried in the sepulchre of monarchy . The author hoped that his colleagues were not possessed with the pernicious principle that , if an inch of their prerogative was parted with , it would be their destruction . If the Commonwealth flourished it was no matter what became of their practices . The impression left by a study of Cook 's works k that of weakness and crudity . His convictions , such as the supremacy of the Law of Nature , the impossibility of a mixed monarchy or a good king , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture and scorns the ' puddles of history . ' The attitude of mind is fundamentally subjective ; the method purely abstract . Of equal importance was Marchamont Needham . Commencing his journalist 's life by editing a paper in the Parliamentary cause from 1643 to 1646 , he had proceeded to devote his services for an equal period to the Royalists . His royalism was never more than skin-deep and his appearance as a republican was not long delayed , for in the spring of 1650 he issued his Case of the Commonwealth , proving the equity , utility and necessity of subminion to the present government against all the scruples and pretences of the opposite parties ' . . The pamphlet explains that the seeming inconsistency of appearing under a new flag arose from the conviction that the conscientious man should recognise the will of God as expressed in the success with which the government had met . The publication was rewarded with a government pension , despite the dangerously cynical character of its thought2 ; i 6o The Foundation of the Republic and on the issue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Needham takes his place as one of the authorised exponents of the policy of the government . The sincerity of his republican professions was further vouched for by the fact that he became ' a great crony ' of Milton ' . The opening pages of The Excellency of a Free State present us with a view of Monarchy very similar to that which we found in the works of Cook . It is credited with no merits . When the people are entrusted with the government , on the other hand , they are so fully occupied in looking after the preservation of their own rights that they never think of usurping those of other men . That none but honest and public-spirited men will desire to occupy places of authority , the machinery of government should be so arranged that the public service becomes a burdensome occupation . A further precaution is taken by strictly limiting the duration of the tenure of power , since , in political as well as physical bodies , motion is the grand preventive of corruption . By this means no time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speedily experience the results of their own activity . A free state also brings with it many positive advantages . A popular regime secures that the door of honour stands open to all that ascend by the steps of merit and virtue . And yet , however much success or service entitles a man to the gratitude of the nation , it is a prime principle of State that he be hindered from being too powerful or popular . Anarchy is as impossible in a free State as oppression ; for when we talk of the people , we do not mean the confused and promiscuous mass of men , nor those who have forfeited their rights by delinquency , apostasy or even neutrality . The government is conducted by the worthy members of the community Minor Literary Champions I 6 I and by no others ' . Concerning this system , the most suitable to nature and reason , certain misunderstandings are rife . The most common , perhaps , is that which regards it as incompatible with the existence of society . But , in fact , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is guaranteed , since in monarchy every man 's right is placed under the will of another . No precedent can be cited by the enemies of freedom against the people 's government , for it will always appear that the people were not in fault but provoked by craft or injustice . A second mistake is also widely prevalent . It is thought that successful government demands judgment and experience , and that in consequence the perpetual presence of inexperienced members in positions of importance would involve a lack of steadiness and decision . The inference is unwarranted . The chief duty of those who hold the reins is to provide remedies for the ills of the country , and , since matters of grievance are matters of common sense , there is no need of any special skill or judgment in devising laws for their remedy2 . But though Needham is convinced that it free State is not open to any damaging indictment , he feels that certain principles of policy should be borne in mind . It is most essential , for instance , that a community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a free State , so that in any alteration of government the seeds of Monarchy may not sprout forth . It is important , too , that every child should be educated in the principles of freedom , and at a suitable age should solemnly abjure the principle of kingly government . Respect for the authority of the votes of Parliament should also be inculcated at an early age , and treason against its majesty should be made a capital crime . All should be accountable , yet frivolous charges against those in authority must be avoided . Above all , not II i 62 The Foundation of the Republic ' Reason of State , that strange pocus , ' but honesty is to inspire the councils of the State . ' The Court Gospel taught in that unworthy book , The Prince , has gained thousands of proselytes ; but in a free State nobody mistakes breaches of faith for policy . ' Of more special directions Needham is sparing ; but it is interesting to notice that a warning is registered against the union of legislative and executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some excellent principles of government , but it is disfigured by not a little sophistry2 . The passage in which the author attempts to answer the contention that in a democracy divisions and tumults are rife is an example . The people , says Needham , almost in the words of Burke , are never in fault ; they are merely provoked by injustice or craft . But this distinction really surrenders the whole case , for it admits that disturbances occur , and that injustice and craft are to be found in a democratic community . Another instance is met with in his discussion of the objection that government needs judgment and experience . In the first place , his contention that the devising of remedies for the ills of the nation is the only important task of government implies a very inadequate notion of the function of the State ; and in the second , the assertion that matters of grievance require no great skill to be remedied points to a lack of observation that is almost childish . A further example of loose thinking appears in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case are the legislative and executive to he in the same hands ; yet he pleads for a single chamber . The first vote of his assembly divides it into two parties , and the majority becomes omnipotent in every department of State . // In addition to those who thus indirectly supported the Government by their advocacy of republicanism , champions of the actual rf , xime were not wanting . Mrs Hutchinson , who speaks for her husband , declared that the Parliament had restored the Commonwealth to a happy , rich and plentiful condition ? ; and an anonymous adherent was convinced that with a fair trial it would take its place with Venice and other long-lived republics ' . To the ecstatic fancy of Ludlow , the nation seemed likely to attain in a short time such measure of happiness as human affairs could experiences . CHAPTER VII The Antagonists of the Oligarchy THE events which culminated in the death of the king gave a new impetus to democratic ideas ' . The resemblance , however , between the regime that followed and the ideals that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England was not monarchical . The rule of the Rump was as essentially the government of a minority as had been that of the king ; and it rested on the sword . The country was ruled , not by laws of its own making , but by the arbitrary proclamations of a body of men which by successive mutilations had come to represent nobody . In addition to the fact that the form of the government was not such as the people approved , ' its spirit was such as to exaggerate the anomaly of its position . The State Papers of the time reveal to us a picture of what can only be described as tyranny . As was frankly replied to Sir Roger Twysden , when pleading against the confiscation of his estates , the House did not look at the nice observance of the law ' . The principle which was consistently followed was to stifle every expression of opinion throughout the country . ' Keep a watchful eye on the confluence of the people on any pretence , ' were the instructions of the . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counties , ' especially in times like these . The most diligent care must be taken to prevent such meetings of the multitude that may make use of pretence to begin insurrection or carry on designs to the interruption of the public peace ' . ' No entry is so common as the notice of a warrant against the circulation of books and newspapers2 , and Mabbott , the licenser , was dismissed for laxity ' . Orders were issued to seize all the private presses in the counties and to arrest the hawkers of books ' . How tyrannical was the effort to muzzle the press is shewn by the fact that , despite the utmost activity of the Government , its exertions were to a great extent fruitless ' . The religious freedom of the people was as little respected . It was ordered that nothing by pretence of pulpit liberty should be suffered in prejudice of the peace and honour of the Government ' . ' The Council of State did its best to suppress even the observance of Christmas ' . It was only because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle , because the majority was split up into partiesamong whom combination , at least for the time , was impossible , and above all the fact that the minority possessed control of the army that the Government was able to maintain itself . The single merit of the Oligarchy was that its members were good administrators ' . // I The most powerful opposition proceeded from the Levellers . After the reconciliation of soldiers and officers early in 1648 , the current of recriminatory pamphlets had again begun to flow ? ; but the revival of the royal cause induced Lilburne to seek a reconciliation with the enemy . If Oliver would act honourably , he was willing to forget the harsh treatment he had received from him , and to aid him with the last drop of his blood ' . The danger passed away sooner than had been anticipated ; but Lilburne continued to desire a rapprochement . Why should not representatives of the minority in Parliament , of the army and of the Levellers meet and draw up a final Agreement ? The suggestion was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independents and Levellers were agreed in aiming to root out the king3 . ' The Agreement that was drawn up by the majority of the Committee which proceeded to sit at Whitehall naturally bore marks of its joint authorship . Yet the Levellers could congratulate themselves on the document as a whole . The Council was to act according to the instructions and limitations imposed on it by the Parliament which elected it , and the Parliament in like manner was to be subordinate to the electors . All cases were to be settled by a jury , and no branch of government was to possess any judicial power . Imprisonment for debt was to be abolished . No one was to contribute to the maintenance of Ministers of whose teaching he did not approve . A new // Parliament was to be urged to rid the kingdom of lawyers and establish Courts in every hundred ' . The Levellers , who , on the strength of Ireton 's approval of their scheme when it was first mentioned to him , had understood that the decision of the majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had been done , as to any more debate upon it , and that it should without any more ado be promoted for subscriptions ' . ' Incredible as it appears that they could have entertained such a notion , on discovering that it was to be submitted to the Council of Officers for discussion they considered the army leaders false to their pledges . All but the Levellers themselves saw that they were engaged in a hopeless task . ' The Grandees and the Levellers , ' declared a Royalist journal tersely , can as soon combine as fire and water ; the one aim at a pure democracy , the others at an oligarchy " . ' And this the debates of the officers , to which representatives of the Levellers were admitted , once more made clear ' . The disappointment found expression in the Plea for Common Right and Freedom which was presented to Fairfax . If he had been honest in his declarations he had now the opportunity to convince the world of it . The opposition that was emasculating the Agreement must be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Representation from the garrisons in Northumberland 6 ; but the appeals produced no effect , and the Agreement was tendered to 1 68 The i1ntagonists of the Oligarchy Parliament almost apologetically in the very month of the king 's death . ' The officers , ' ran the communication to the House , were far from desiring to impose their private apprehensions on the judgments of any man , much less on members of Parliament . If it were not accepted , it might at least remain as a testimony of their endeavours for a settlement ' . ' A month later the right of petitioning and of meeting in the army was strictly limited , and on March r the proposal for a revival of the General Council was rejected . These measures led to a final outbreak in the army itself . A letter was presented to Fairfax attacking the officers with great boldness . The writers were expelled from the army , and in a few days their revenge was ready . The Hunting of the Foxes from Triploe Heath to Westminster by five small Beagles is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It put the question which half England was asking itself . ' We were ruled before by King , Lords and Commons , now by a General , Court Martial and Commons ; and we pray you what is the difference ' ? ' The protest was followed by a mutiny in London . Despite its easy suppression , the execution of Lockyer revealed the serious nature of the opposition which the army 's policy had aroused . The corpse was preceded by a thousand ' and followed by ' thousands , ' clothed in black and bearing the green ensign ' . In his dying speech the victim declared that , as he was brought thither to suffer for the people , he knew that God would make his blood speak liberty to all England ' . A few weeks later , undaunted by the decisive measures of the officers , Captain Thompson mutinied in Oxfordshire and was joined by considerable numbers . His // manifesto declared that , since it was notorious that the faith of the army had not been observed , no other means under heaven were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve their native rights . They were resolved to redeem their native country and to redeem it according to the principles of the Agreement of John Lilburne , and would endeavour to liberate him and his colleagues and to avenge any hurt that they might suffer ' . The revolt , however , was subdued , and the discontent in other regiments took no active form ' . When next the Levellers began to rise in the South and West , the soldiers whom they expected to take their part were ready to resist them3 . With this repulse the final opposition by the Levellers within the army comes to a close 4 . The struggle was meanwhile being carried on by the civilian Levellers . True , Parliament had declared the people to be the original of all just power ; but its reforming zeal had been contented with declarations ' . At the end of February it was invited to lay seriously to heart certain proposals which found no place in the Agreement . No interval should elapse between successive Parliaments , which should be annual instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tithes demanded , no imprisonment for debt permitted . The laws were to be reformed and liberty of religion ensured . Work and a comfortable maintenance I 7o The Antagonists of the Oligarchy should be provided for the poor and impotent ; for the people in general had suffered through decay of trade and dearness of food , and had nothing left them but hopes of better times ' . No party had so evidently transgressed against the light as their old colleagues ' . For the Second Part of England 's New Chains , Lilburne , Walwyn , Overton and Price ? the four names occur henceforth in invariable connection ? were forthwith arrested ' . Petitions for their release at once began to pour in ' . The women declared they could not eat nor drink in peace nor sleep in quiet for fear for their husbands and sons ' . When a member of the House bade them stay at home and wash their dishes , they replied that they had scarce any left to wash , and were not sure of keeping these . If the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Cromwell appeared outside the House , nothing would satisfy them but his life ' . Being ordered back to the closest durance after examination by the Council of State , Lilburne found means to issue a graphic account of the incident ' . Indeed , as Mr Firth has remarked , it seemed utterly impossible to deprive him of ink . He had told the members that the laws and liberties of England were his inheritance and his birthright . They were not a Court of Justice , for the law made no reference to them ; they were not a Council of State , for they had no commission from the people . W hen they asked him whether he h The Levellers I 7 I replied that the Star Chamber had been abolished for precisely such questions . On his retirement from the Council Chamber he heard Cromwell declare his conviction that there was no other way of dealing with them but to break them to pieces ' . The narrative of their sufferings was closely followed by a remarkable declaration of their principles . None were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law of Nature and by Christianity to endeavour the happiness of the community . For this each must be able to enjoy his own with security . But this is only possible where the depravity of man is counteracted by ' institutions so designed as to give it no play . That because they demanded a good government they were for no government at all was an inference warranted neither by their conduct nor their teaching ' . The high tone that had been regained by the party since the final breach with the army is maintained in the ultimate shape which the Agreement of the People assumed . The authors describe the document as ' the end and full scope of all our desires and intentions in government , wherein we shall rest absolutely satisfied , ' and add that they trust it will satisfy all ingenuous people that we are not such wild , irrational and dangerous creatures as we are aspersed . ' Parliament is to consist of 400 members , chosen , according to natural right , by all of the age of 21 who are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a member , and no member may sit in two successive Parliaments . During adjournment the Government is to be conducted not by a Council but by a Committee . The Representative has power to preserve order , to regulate commerce , to supervise the coinage . On the other hand , Parliament may not legislate in matters of religion , I72 The Antagonists of the Oligarchy nor may it impress for service . It may not grant monopolies , nor impose taxes on food . Passing to the judicial part of the scheme , we meet the familiar requirements , equality before the law , definite penalties , abolition of imprisonment for debt . No one is compelled to witness against himself ; prisoners are allowed counsel ; all cases must he settled within six months . Capital punishment is reserved for murder , and for the attempt to destroy the Agreement . Tithes are to be abolished , and each parish is to make its own arrangements with Ministers as to terms and salary . All public officers are to be elected locally and to serve for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement of the Parliament and the people , the former electing the General and higher officers , the latter choosing the rest in proportion to the population . Finally , the Agreement is incapable of being altered by any Parliament ' . During the summer of 1649 the leader of the party remained in prison , issuing pamphlets , as usual , at short intervals . The Legal Fundamental Liberties once more insisted that representatives from the army and each county should meet and draw up an Agreement which should be beyond repeal ' . The Impeachment of High Treason against Cromwell and Ireton , surpassing in violence anything that had yet appeared from Lilburne 's pen ' , determined the Government to silence its author4 . The speech of the defendant at the trial which ensued , filled though it was with quibbles and technicalities , was followed by such an extraordinary great hum ' that three more companies of foot were ordered to the Court . For the jury as for the onlookers , the question of treason resolved itself into the broader issue whether the country should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wills ; and the verdict of acquittal was greeted by a shout which lasted for half-an-hour , and was commemorated by the striking of a medal ' . The significance of the movement in the history of political thought comes to an end at this point ' . With more truth than any other body of men of the time , the Levellers could claim to he considered as the people 's party . Their thought rested on the conviction that the ordering of the life of a nation should be in accordance with certain moral principles which every man finds implanted in him . Of these the most important was that liberty is a right demanded by the very nature of human beings : not merely a freedom from the restraint of others , but a conscious and deliberate share in such arrangements as the community finds it necessary to make . From this right of the individual springs the // sovereignty of the people , a sovereignty bounded , however , by social duty and by justice . Of the fundamentals which are inseparable from their well-being the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the teaching proceeded was the confirmation which was afforded by history to the ideas inseparable from man 's nature . Appeal was made , in the first place , to certain definite constitutional rights inherited from their ancestors , recorded in Magna Charm and the Statute Book ; in the second , to a contract that had been entered into by their forefathers in pre-historic times . In this argumentative structure two elements of weakness reveal themselves . The appeal to natural right , as Ireton pointed out , is in its essence anarchic , and ? a historical basis which is but half historical does not cure the defect . In the second place , the human unit is credited with possessing more wisdom than , it is to be feared , it can claim . The natural aristocracy , ' which , as Harrington was shortly to maintain , is the life-blood of successful democratic government , finds no place in the system elaborated by Lilburne and his fellows . We are sometimes tempted to forget the solid worth of many of the ideas of the Levellers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to recognise that behind their opportunism and their self-seeking , behind their doctrinaire habits of thought , lies a treasure of political counsels unequalled in its variety and suggestiveness by any system of the age save in that of Harrington . The Communists 175 II Though it was unlikely that in an age where the soil was so deeply ploughed some forms of Communism should not appear , it is too little known that the English revolution presents some of the most remarkable communistic speculations in history ' . In commenting in the House on the petitions for the disendowment of the Church , the poet Waller foretold that the people would not stop with a plea for equality in ecclesiastical matters . ' Our laws and the present government of the Church , ' said he , ' are mixed like wine and water . I look on the episcopate as an outwork or barrier , and say to myself that if this is stormed by the people and the secret thereby discovered that we can deny them nothing which they demand , we shall have a task no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lately to preserve it against the prerogative of the Crown . I therefore counsel the reform and not the abolition of the Church- . ' The Church was destroyed , and , as Waller had foretold , an attack was made on property itself . The common cry that the slavery of the people dated from the Norman Conquest provided a convenient plea for a revision of the system of property which had been instituted by that event . With this position the name of John Hare is specially connected . In 1647 he published a pamphlet bearing the characteristic title of St Edward 's Ghost , urging the people to revolts . A few weeks later , Plain English to ear Wilful Bearers of Normanism laments both in its title and preface that the previous pamphlet had ' obtained no regard . ' The // author therefore devotes himself to proving that , while the right of conquest is recognised , the privileges of the Law of Nature and the necessities of the Salus Populi are alike forgotten ' . In the following year , Hare blew a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On this occasion he indicated England 's proper and only way to an establishment in honour , power , peace and happiness ; and , in reply to the objection that the rooting out of the innovations would he a difficult and troublesome matter , retorts that the nation had taken more pains over things of less importance ' . Hare , however , had rather vague notions of what he desired to substitute for the system of property that he attacked . The manysided Hartlib , on the other hand , elaborated an Utopia of singular interest . In the famous kingdom of Macaria , the government is carried on by a Great Council , divided into five committees , dealing with Agriculture , Fishing , Trade by land , Trade by sea , and Plantations . In other words , the State is an economic institution and directs and supervises every branch of production . For this reason , the conduct of the individual is the concern of the State , and if anybody holds more land than he is able to improve to the uttermost , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth which thereby ensues . If his husbandry does not amend in a year 's time , he incurs a penalty which every year of contumacy doubles . If time shews him to be incorrigible , he is banished and his lands are forfeited to the community ' . Further traces of the conviction that the time was // approaching for drastic changes in the economic system of the country are to be found . While Hare had attacked the prevalent constitution of society as a lawyer and Hartlib as a philanthropist , Chamberlen approaches the subject from the standpoint of a trained economist . The Poor Man 's Advocate declares on its first page ' that the most necessary work of man is to provide for the poor . For this the author proposes no mere alteration of the Poor Laws , but the nationalisation of all Crown and Church possessions and the rescue of all common lands that had been enclosed ' . This mass of property is to form a National Stock and to be administered for the benefit of the poor ' . In rejecting the assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chamberlen takes care to point out that his proposal is for the genuine poor and not for beggars . Some years later , a Dutchman , named Peter Cornelius , pro- pounded a Way to the Peace and Settlement of these Nations , to make the poor in these and other nations happy ' . He congratulated the country on the liberty it had possessed since the abolition of the hierarchy , but declared that tithe remained as the chief cause of persecution and discontent . It was desirable therefore that this and the old system of society with which it was connected should come to an end , and that Christendom should become a worldstate under the rule of a single magistracy . With this object // individuals were to form joint-stock associations in which they lived together , but in which they might retain the control of their property . It was expected , however , that the members of each ' little Commonwealth ' would form in every respect one household . They were to elect a governor from among themselves for a year , and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational ' people , and of these only those who were skilled in some trade or occupation , were to be admitted as members , and any who proved to be unsuitable were to be expelled . Those unfit for admission were to be employed by the household , and on reaching a certain standard of good conduct to be allowed to enter ' . All vices arising from riches and poverty , inequality , exploitation and the like , would vanish ' . Though these remarkable pamphlets emanated from a Dutchman , they were written in English and with a full knowledge of English affairs . And from the fact that such speculation was unknown in the Low Countries at this time ' , it is hardly fanciful to attribute them to English influence . We have found that men representing various classes entertained views and elaborated proposals in some measure communistic , without actually being communists themselves . Is anything more systematic and far-reaching to be found among the Levellers ? The organ of the party , The Moderate , certainly speaks for the largest section , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was very far from being a Leveller , // and expressly disclaims any sympathy with the notions of the Diggers ' . Walwyn , on the other hand , was more extreme in his notions , and many stories were abroad of his questioning spirit . Though he did not publish any heretical opinions , he seems to have been careless who was present when he was talking . At any rate he was pilloried in 1645 in the first volume of the Gangraena as a dangerous mane . Several years later we meet with accusations of a more explicit character . In order to work on the poorer sort , ' we are told that he declared ' he could wish there was neither pale , hedge , nor ditch in the nation , for it was an unconscionable thing one should have ? 1o,000 , and another , more useful and deserving to the Commonwealth , not be worth twopence . ' He had been overheard declaring in conversation that it would never be well till all things were common . ' But will that ever be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would destroy government . " There would be no need of government , for there would be no thieves or criminals ' . ' Since the vindications of Walwyn confine themselves to the charges of heresy and evil character we may consider it probable that he , alone of the levellers , was to a great extent a convinced communists . // When the monarchy was gone , the time seemed to have come for the transition from theoretical to practical communism . Though the working-classes had stood aloof from the great struggle , they shared the general expectation that the establishment of the Republic would usher in the era of reform . The rise of prices consequent on the discovery of new supplies of the precious metals was followed but slowly by the increase of wages , and the hardship was heightened by the monopoly prices demanded for many of the necessities of lifes . To these chronic evils was added , during the fifth decade of the century , that of a series of unusually bad harvests2 . The war , too , had brought with it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other , the intolerable vexation of free quarter . Though the miserable condition of the poor was constantly discussed and the proposals for amelioration were numerous3 , the pamphlets and newspapers of the time are full of lament that no improvement was being effected ' . The Communists i 81 Although it was not till 1649 that public attention was directed to the appearance of a new doctrine , the outlines of it are to be found in a pamphlet published in December , 1648 . The Light Shining in Buckinghamshire announces in its sub-title a discussion of the main cause of the slavery of the world . By the grant of God all were free alike , and no individual was intended to exercise rule over his fellow-men . But man , following his sensuality , became an encloser , so that all the land was enclosed in a few mercenary hands and all the rest made their slaves . ' Of these robbers the most desperate was made king in order to protect the rest in their misdoings . Each should have a just portion , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government should be carried on by elders chosen by the people , who would decide all questions in every town and hamlet without any further trouble . At the present time we were governed by nobles and priests . All our nobility and gentry were originally the servants of William the Conqueror ; their rise was their country 's ruin , and the putting them down would he the restoration of our rights . The base priests preach all our powers and constitutions to be Jure Divino . Shake off these locusts and be no more deluded by them ; cast off these abominable deceivers ' . ' Four months later , the exhortation To your tents , 0 Israel , ' with which the earlier pamphlet had closed , bore fruit . On April 16 , the Council of State received the following intelligence . On Sunday sennight last , there was one Everard , once of the Army but cashiered , who termeth himself a prophet , and four more came to St George 's Hill in Surrey and began to dig , and ' 8 2 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrots and beans . On Monday following they were there again , being increased in their number . On Friday they came again , twenty or thirty , and wrought all day at digging . They do threaten to pull down and level all park pales and lay open and intend to plant them . They give out that they will be four or five thousand within ten days , and threaten the neighbouring people they will make them all come up to the hills and work . ' The letter was at once forwarded by Bradshaw to Fairfax , with a request that he should send some horse to disperse the disorderly and tumultuous people . A force was at once dispatched , and three days later Fairfax was informed that the affair was not worth notice . There had never been above twenty of the diggers . They had met Everard and Winstanley , their leaders , and they had promised to appear before Fairfax ; but he would be glad to be rid of them again ' . The following day the leaders appeared before the Council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , declared Everard , had been lost by the coming of the Conqueror . The time of deliverance was now at hand , and God would restore them their freedom to enjoy the fruits of the earth . A vision had appeared to him , and a voice had bidden him dig and plough the earth and receive the fruits thereof . Their intention was to distribute the benefits of the earth to the poor and needy , to feed the hungry and clothe the naked . They did not intend to meddle with property nor to break any enclosures , but only to take what was common and untilled and to make it fruitful . They were willing to live in tents as their forefathers , whose // principles they took for a model , had lived . The speaker had kept his hat on in the presence of the General , remarking that he was their fellow-creature . No further steps were taken by the Government at the time . They felt , perhaps , that rumour had exaggerated the importance of the diggers , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless fanatics . A week after the examination , however , appeared a manifesto revealing the fact that behind the artless confession to which they had listened lay a philosophy which threatened every existing institution . The True Leveller 's Standard Advanced , or the State of Community opened and presented to the sons of men , published on April 26 , was a declaration to the powers of England and to the powers of the world why the common people had begun to dig on St George 's Hill . " In the beginning , ' runs the manifesto , striking a new note in the first sentence , ' the great creator Reason made the Earth a common treasury for beasts and man . ' Not a word was said by which one man could claim rule over another . But man falling into blindness was brought into bondage , and became a greater slave to his own kind than the beasts of the field to him . i lereupon the earth , made for a common treasury or relief to all , was bought and sold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of a few . For a certain time the creator , the spirit Reason , thus suffered himself to be rejected ; whence arose wars to uphold dominion and riches , the curse under which creation groans . But when the earth again becomes a common treasury , as it must , for Reason and all the prophecies of Scripture point to it , all enmity will cease ; for none will desire a larger share than another ' . Passing from an exposition of their philosophy to a vindication of their recent conduct , the authors declare that they l 84 The .1ntagonists of the Oligarchy have met with resistance because they maintain an universal liberty , which was not only their birthright , but which they had bought with their money and blood in the war . All landlords lived in breach of the commandment ' Thou shalt not steal . ' They had induced the plain-hearted poor to work for them with small wages , and by their work had made great fortunes . By their very labour the poor raised up tyrants to rule over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them in dreams where they should begin to dig , and that though the earth might be barren they should receive a blessing from the spirit . ' You Pharaohs , you have rich clothing and full bellies , you have your honours and your ease ; but know the day of judgment is begun and that it will reach you ere long . The poor people you oppress shall be the saviours of the land . If you will find mercy , let Israel go free ; break to pieces the bands of property ' . ' The Diggers still remained quietly employed at St George 's Hill . When Fairfax came from Guildford to London at the end of May , he visited the locality and found twelve of them hard at work . To a short admonition from the General , they replied that they were digging crown lands , and that , the king who possessed them by the Norman Conquest being dead , they returned to the common people2 . The day after the visit of the General appeared another manifesto of the party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists s 85 It was prompted by the fact that they were in all directions cutting down and selling trees on common lands and thereby impoverishing them ' . ' God has enlightened our hearts , ' said the writers , to see that the earth was not made purposely for you to he the lords and we to be your slaves ' ; but they still declared that they had no intention of resorting to force . This appeal producing no effect , a letter was soon after dispatched to Fairfax . Ile had been mild and moderate to them in Court and when he had come to see them , and the author was thereby emboldened to plead with him for justice . The laws that had been made in the days of monarchy had given freedom to the gentry and clergy , but had done nothing for the people In July the persecution which they had so remarkably escaped fell upon them . Winstanley and two of his comrades were brought before the Court at Kingston for trespass , and the jury consisted of ' such as stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak and were heavily fined . Thereupon they sent an account of their arrest and sentence to the House of Commons , once more explaining their position and defending their claims . They enclosed a list of some of the abominations which William the Conqueror introduced into England , among which were those of tithes and lawyers ' . At the end of November a more serious attack was made upon the little community . A party of soldiers appeared , pulled down the two houses in which they were living and carried the wood away in a cart . A long and eloquent letter from Winstanley followed . The arguments are for the first time wholly devoid of the familiar Digger philosophy . There is t 86 The Antagonists of the Oligarchy not a word about Natural Right . They claim nothing more than the fulfilment of a contract . Parliament had virtually said to them , Give us taxes , free quarter , excise , venture your lives with us to cast out the oppressor , and we will make you a free people . They had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be equally divided between those who went to war and those who stayed at home and paid them . They claimed freedom in the common land by virtue of their conquest over the king , for they had bought it by their blood and money . If the Government denied them their request , it would have to raise money for their support ; whereas , if they were allowed to reclaim the waste land , England would be correspondingly enriched . Besides , it was a stain on a Christian nation that there should be so much waste land and that so many should starve for want ' . The destruction of the houses seems to have put an end to the little settlement ; at any rate we hear no more of it ' . But the leader of the Diggers was far from losing heart or bating a jot of his principles . In A New Year 's Gift for the Parliament and Army , Winstanley attempted to demonstrate that branches of kingly power still remained . Tithes had been promised to the clergy by the Conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Our old law-books were still in use and should be burnt in Cheapside . If the government was to be new , let the laws be new also . England was a prison ; the subtleties of its laws the bolts and bars ; the lawyers its jailors " . ' The second part of the pamphlet4 contains The Communists t 87 one of the most arresting passages Winstanley ever wrote , and prepares us for the work on which he was about to engage . At this very day poor people are forced to work for ? d. a day , and corn is dear . And the tithing-priest stops their mouth , and tells them that " inward satisfaction of mind " was meant by the declaration " The poor shall inherit the earth . " I tell you , the scripture is to be really and materially fulfilled ... You jeer at the name Leveller . I tell you Jesus Christ is the head Leveller ' . ' Winstanley had gradually won the position he now occupied as the acknowledged leader of the English Communists . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifteen who signed The True Levellers ' Standard Advanced , and of the forty-five who subscribed to the declaration to the Lords of Manors . Since then , almost every work produced by the movement had appeared in his name alone . The snatches of rhyme that are scattered through his pamphlets render it probable that the Diggers ' Song discovered among Clarke 's papers is from his pen , while the similarity of position assumed in the Light of Buckinghamshire to that of the later pamphlets forbids us to believe that he was not author , or at least joint author , of the earliest manifesto of the movement . In striking contrast to his importance and ability is the impenetrable obscurity in which his early history is involved ' . He prefaces his Watchword to the City of London with a few lines of autobiography . ' I was once a freeman of thine , but beaten out of estate and trade by t by cheating sons in the thieving art of buying and selling . I was t herefore forced to live a country life , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oligarchy and free quarter my weak back found the burden heavier than I could bear . ' While his worldly prospects were at a low ebb he received consolation from an unexpected source . ' Not a year since 1 , my heart was filled with sweet thoughts and many things were revealed to me I never read in books nor heard from the mouth of flesh ; and when I began to speak of them , some people could not hear my words . " Then I took my spade and began to dig on St George 's Fl ill . ' The experiment , as we have seen , had not been encouraging , but , undismayed by its failure , he now set himself to elaborate the constructive part of his system . In Feb. 1652 it was ready , and The Law of Freedom appeared , with a dedication to ' All the Nations of the Earth 2 . ' The Dedicatory Epistle informs Cromwell that he and his officers had not conquered by their unaided efforts but by the help of the common people , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whom a change of names without a change of things would never satisfy . The clergy were opponents of liberty ; yet tithes still swallowed up the savings of the poor . Even where the laws were good they were tampered with by magistrates . Worst of all , the landlords still ruled the country as tyrants . It might he asked how the clergy and the landowners were to exist if tithes and service were withdrawn . The answer leads us to the kernel of Winstanley 's teaching . A different system must be introduced . In the new society there must be no buying nor selling , for with bargaining came deception and from deceit sprang oppression . With the disappearance of buying and selling , there will be no more lawyers . But may not one he richer than another ? For two reasons he may not . In the first place , riches give men power to . // oppress their fellow-men and stir up wars . And , secondly , riches are impossible to obtain by honest means . A man can never become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted by others , a share in the result of their joint exertions belongs to them . In the first chapter Winstanley proceeds to declare that freedom is to be found only in the unimpeded enjoyment of the land . Property there must be , but all must possess it . A similar transformation must be effected in relation to magistracy . All bearers of office must be elected , and none may hold a post for more than one year ' . Passing to the economic ordering of the new state , production is to be carried on both by individual and cooperative activity . Exchange , however , is purely communistic ; each brings what he has produced into the common store and takes what he needs either for maintenance or for his work . A certain quantum is expected from each , and , if it is not forthcoming , the worker is placed under supervision and if necessary is punished . Should any abuse arise in drawing from the common stock , a similar course is followed . Education , which is universal , includes technical instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be continued after that age at will2 . Those who have reached the age of sixty superintend the well-being of the entire community . The town and county officials compose the county Parliament and Court . Members of the national Parliament must be over forty , unless specially distinguished , and are chosen by all over twenty . The chief duty of the clergy is to provide instruction , on the weekly day of rest , consisting of a relation of the chief events which have happened during the week , readings from the laws of the land , and lectures on subjects of general interest . The pt lest is to confine himself to what he has learned from study and observation . For to know the secrets of Nature is to know the 8 . T 90 The Antagonists of the Oligarchy works of God , and to know the works of God is to know God Himself . Marriage is a civil rite , and may be terminated for sufficient reasons by a declaration of the parties before an officer and witnesses . Buying and selling are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the property of any special individual subjects the speaker to branding ' . Of Winstanley there is little more to relate ' . Soon after completing the presentation of his thought , he seems to have joined the Quakers . His latest work , The Saints ' Paradise , appearing in 16583 , combines something of his old spaciousness of thought with a quietism that is largely new . We notice with interest the blending of Quakerism and the Digger philosophy . ' The heart that thinks it can not live without money , lands , the help of man and creatures , is tempted of the devil ; the pure spirit or holy law within tells the heart he must be stript of all these and trust to Providence for subsistence ' . ' It would be easy to exaggerate the importance of the little colony of Diggers on St George 's Hill . The greater number of them , beyond all doubt , had no other views than were common to the Franconian and Thuringian peasants of 1525 , or those who followed the standard of Ket in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to overestimate the significance of their spokesman in the history of thought . Alone of his English contemporaries , he recognised the well-being of the proletariat as constituting the criterion not only of political but of social and economic conditions . Determining that their rights were not . The Communists I 9 I secured in the actual state of society , he proceeded to develop a complete scheme of socialism . That he looked in a different direction from the other thinkers of the age constitutes his unique interest . In the earnest spirit which breathes through his scheme , Winstanley is perhaps equalled by Vairasse and Meslier and Cabet ; in his consideration for the poor , he may be matched by the author of the Utopia . But in the completeness with which he anticipates modern developments , he stands alone . By his very weaknesses , too , he is curiously modern . Human nature is capable of transformation if certain changes are effected . The knowledge of the scholar is despised , for culture breeds contempt . Practical instruction ' is to be followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forbidden . Equally unsatisfactory is the reading of history . But when all reservations are made , he can claim to have seen that certain ideas nominally accepted by the conscience of mankind involved far-reaching social and economic transformations , and to have proclaimed that until society was organised on a moral basis no political changes could bear fruit . CHAPTER VIII Monarchy without Kingship I WHEN the end of the oligarchical government came in 1653 , the country was ready for it . The statement of the Protector that not a dog barked ' is confirmed by the State Papers , the Memoirs , and the Correspondence of the times . Indeed the event called forth not a little enthusiasm ; and where there was no enthusiasm there was no regret2 . In attempting to explain Cromwell 's political theory , one of two mistakes has been almost universally made ' . Either it is affirmed that the later part of his career merely carried out designs formed in the earlier ; or it is contended that his philosophy was the child of opportunism , and that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note is struck in his earliest recorded speeches in the Council of Officers . ' I am very often judged for one that goes too fast4 , ' said he , during the discussion whether the Army // should march up to London and threaten the Parliament in the summer of 1647 . Give me leave to say this to you . For my own part I have as few extravagant thoughts of obtaining great things from the Parliament as any man ; but have what you will have , that you have by force I look upon it as nothing . I do not know that force is to be used except we can not get what is for the good of the kingdom without force ' . ' It was indeed commonly remarked that the Lieutenant-General rarely expressed decided opinions . ' He seemed to have great cunning , ' said Waller , his old commander , long afterwards , speaking of his early days , and while cautious of his own words , not putting forth too many lest they betray his thoughts , he made others talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and known their designs ' . ' But the seeming hypocrisy arose from the real difficulty that he felt in forming a judgment . The cautious temper maintained in spite of the exasperating conduct of Parliament finds its counterpart in his attitude towards the proposals of the Levellers . When the Agreement of the People was handed in , he was almost staggered by the number and magnitude of the changes that it suggested . ' Truly this paper does contain in it very great alterations of the government of the kingdom , alterations from that government that it hath been under , I believe I may almost say since it was a nation . How do we know if , whilst we are disputing about these things , another company of men shall gather together and put out a paper as plausible as this ? And not only another , but many of this kind ? A aid if so , what do you think the consequence would be. ? Would it not be utter confusion ' ? ' On being induced to discuss the document , the Lieutenant-General took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not deny the contention C // of its adherents that it was a birthright of every man ; his philosophy was not sufficiently definite to decide upon the point , and he employed the argument from probabilities . ' The consequences of this rule tend to anarchy , must end in anarchy . For where is there any bound or limit set if men that have but the interest of breathing shall have voices in elections ' ? ' The attitude towards Monarchy is equally moderate . After the capture of Oxford , for instance , it is recorded by James II that he alone of all the officers knelt to kiss the prince 's hand ' . But Cromwell was well aware that other forms of government were feasible . ' We all apprehend danger from the person of the king and from the Lords . I think that if it were free before us whether we should set up one or the other , there is not any intention to set up one or the other . So neither is it our intention to preserve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' But that they were such a danger he had not yet convinced himself . The course of the negotiations with the king we have already seen . When he had visited Charles , he told Berkeley he had seen the tenderest sight his eyes ever beheld , the interview of the king with his children ; ' and he wept plentifully at the remembrance , saying : Never was man so abused as he in his sinister opinions of the king , who , he thought , was the uprightest and most conscientious man of his three kingdoms4 . ' However coloured the story be by its narrator , at any rate Cromwell risked his popularity in his endeavour to arrive at a settlement , and earned the title of ' the King-ridden ' from Henry Marten . A year later , after the crisis of the second Civil War , he had received assistance from the logic of events . ' Authorities and 1 . // powers , ' he writes to Hammond ' , ' are the ordinance of God . All agree there are cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , dear Robin , the query is whether ours be such a case . I desire thee to consider what thou findest in thy heart to two or three plain questions . First , whether Salus Populi be a sound position ? Secondly , whether this Army be a lawful power , called by God to oppose and fight against the king ? My dear friend , let us look into providences ; surely they mean somewhat . They hang so together ; they have been so constant , clear , unclouded . Malice , swollen malice against God 's people now called Saints , to root out their name ; and yet they , these poor Saints , getting arms , and therein blessed more and more ! ' Yet he still repeatedly expressed his desire to maintain the old framework of the constitution ; and even when all thoughts of compromise had passed away , and though he was determined that the king should be brought to trial ' , he desired that his life might he spared3 . But of the justice of the sentence he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to beg for the king 's life , Oliver entered into a long discourse of the nature of the regal prerogative according to the principles of Mariana and Buchanan . He thought a breach of trust ought to he punished more than any other crime whatever ? . ' The story that in after times he tried to excuse himself from a share in the incident by the plea that he had been compelled thereto by Ireton ' . 13-2 I 96 Monarchy without Kingship must be a fable , though there is no reason to doubt that he was deeply affected by the execution ' . Eighteen months later he wrote to the Governor of Edinburgh Castle that they had ' turned out a tyrant , in a way which all tyrants in the world would look at with fear , ' while many thousands of Saints in England rejoiced to think of it2 . It is beyond doubt that from the time of the execution of the king , and still more after the Irish and Scotch victories , Cromwell was looked to by thousands to redress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be continually borne in mind in studying his conduct during the following years . Until now there is no reason to suppose that the thought of becoming supreme had occurred to him ' . After Worcester , however , he invited several members of Parliament to a meeting , and told them that , the king being dead and his son defeated , he held it necessary to reach some settlement of the nation . ' My meaning , ' said he , is that we should consider whether a republic or a mixed monarchical government will be best ; and if something monarchical , then in whom power shall be placed . ' At the end of the discussion he remarked : It will be a business of more than ordinary difficulty . But really I think that a settlement of somewhat with monarchical power in it would be very effectual ? . ' The dis- . // cession proved that the soldiers were one and all republican , but t hat the lawyers preferred some form of monarchical government , the proposal of choosing one of the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly a year Cromwell was silent ; but in November , 1652 , he reopened'the question in a conversation with Whitelocke . ' " There is very great cause for us , ' he began , ' to improve the mercies and successes which God hath given us , and not to be fooled out of them and broken in pieces by our particular jarrings and animosities against each other . ' The army , he continued , had conceived a strong dislike for the Parliament . ' And I wish there were not too much cause for it . For really their pride and ambition and self-seeking , their daily breaking forth into new factions , their delays of business and design to perpetuate themselves ; these things , my lord , do give too much ground for people to open their mouths towards them . So that , unless there be some authority so full and so high as to restrain and keep things in better order , it will be impossible to prevent our ruin . ' But they had been acknowledged as the supreme power , remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Cromwell replied by another question , ' What if a man should take upon him to be king ? ' After Whitelocke 's remonstrances , he continued , ' Surely the power of a king is so great and high and so universally understood and reverenced by the people of this nation that it would be of great advantage in such times as these ' . ' Six months later the hostility of the army had become still more pronounced , and , urged on by Harrison , Cromwell by a sudden resolution brought the existing regime to an end and became Protector ' . t98 Monarchy without Kingship There is no reason to doubt that his disapproval or a permanent Parliament was deep and genuine . His faith in the disinterested virtue of the Commonwealthsmen had been shattered on learning that they were forcing through a bill to perpetuate their own power . ' We could not believe such persons would be so unworthy , ' Ile observed in his first speech ; ' we remained till a second and third messenger came with tidings that the House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue . We should have had a Council of State and a Parliament executing arbitrary government without intermission . ' Things had now been changed . ' They come and tell me they do not like my being Protector . What do you want me to do ? " Pray turn these gentlemen of the Long Parliament all in again . We fear you will exercise arbitrary government . " They fear , these objectors , arbitrary government by me ; but if arbitrary government were restored by reinstatement of the Long Parliament , then they are not afraid of it . Such hypocrisies , should they enter into the heart of any man that hath truth or honesty in him ' ? ' What , then , were the proper duties of a Parliament ? Certain points were altogether beyond its province . ' In every government there must he somewhat fundamental , somewhat like a Magna Charta , which should be unalterable . That Parliaments should not make themselves perpetual is a fundamental . Liberty of Conscience is a fundamental . That the command of the Militia should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or out of Parliament have a power of ordering it is a fundamental . ' // But he can not trust the Parliament to preserve the fundamentals . Of what assurance is a law to prevent an evil if it be in the same way legal to unlaw it again ? Are such laws like to be lasting ' ? ' In a word , a Single Person must be constantly at hand in times of crisis to protect the people against itself . As he himself remarked , his duty was to act as police constable to the warring factions of the country ; and in this aspect he was very commonly regarded2 . Yet he is aware that this might seem dangerous , and will minimise the risk by excluding the hereditary principle . If you had offered me this one thing , that the Government should have been placed in my family , hereditarily , I would have rejected it ; and this bath been my constant judgment , well known to many who hear me speak ' . ' Cromwell had been but little concerned with administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light heart . It was regarded as significant of his conviction that he was able to bear the burden alone that he left the post of LieutenantGeneral vacant ' . But the creation of his brain to some extent broke down in its practical application , and this led to a slight modification of theory . His numerous protestations of inability to remain ' Sole Director of England , ' as he was addressed by the Czar ' , may be taken to express his new-born conviction that the destinies of a great nation were beyond the strength of a single ruler to control . Read in this light the decided expression of his preference for a free Parliament in his Second Speech loses its seeming insincerity ' . Yet the Parliament is to represent the // worthy alone , and , among the worthy , only those who have a stake in the country . Nobody who had opposed the Parliament since the commencement of the Civil War , ran Oliver 's Reform Bill , could elect or be elected ; none but persons of known integrity and good conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 were to possess the franchise ' . Oliver 's ideal , in a word , was that a Parliament , elected by the worthy members of the nation , assisted by an executive , should in ordinary circumstances carry on the government and that a Single Person should be invested with a dictatorship if any difficulties were to arise , resigning his power after the circumstances which made it necessary had passed away . ' I called not myself to this place , ' he declared after eighteen months of rule . ' A chief end of calling this Parliament was to lay down the power which was in my hands ' . ' The new Parliament did not inspire him with confidence , and the burden became at times intolerable . He caught at every opportunity to beg advice from his opponents . On one occasion Hertford had lost several of his children , and Oliver followed up his letter of sympathy with an invitation to dinner . ' I am not able to bear the weight of business that is on me , ' said he ; ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall do ' . ' On another occasion the Protector asked Roger Boyle the news of the City . " T is said you are going to marry your daughter to the king . ' ' What think they of it ? ' asked Oliver . ' The wisest thing you can do . ' ' Then Cromwell made a stand and looking steadfastly in my face , said , " And do you believe so too ? " " Yes , " I replied ; " you can not trust your party ; you must secure yourself . " ' The Protector , however , ended the conversation with the repeated // assertion that the king could not forgive his father 's death ' . Physical signs , too , that the strain was proving too much for him were not wanting ' . Two objects took almost complete possession of the Protector 's thought ,  --  to satisfy the godly and to settle the government on a legal basis . ' I know it is a trouble to my Lord , ' wrote Thurloe to Monk , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be grieved or unsatisfied with him3 ' ; and confirmations of these remarkable words are numerous . It was this feeling which prompted him to implore Harrison to desist from the plots in which he was losing himself4 , to urge Colonel Hutchinson to return to public life ' , to seek the friendship of Sir Richard Fanshawe " , to augment the stipend of his outspoken critic , John Shawl . While the greater number of the protests that crowded in " left him unmoved , the remonstrance from three of his old comrades , written more in sorrow than in anger , must have filled him with grief " . That the settlement of his government on a more legal basis was equally desired the proofs are manifold . When a pamphleteer maintained that possession was the only right to power , Cromwell expressed the utmost abhorrence for the doctrine and ordered the book to be burned " . The proposal to assume the // title of king , almost universally regarded at the time as one more sign of his contempt for legality , arose from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ' rather have any name from it than any name without it ' . ' It was this desire too that led to the Petition and Advice , the object of which , though granting the power to the Protector of appointing his successor , was to increase the power of the Commons and , by instituting a Second Chamber , to revive at least the outward form of the historic constitution ' . The same resolution to change as little as possible , even at the cost of alienating old supporters , appears in Cromwell 's relations to the Church . The complaint of Evelyn3 is not borne out by the evidence , and in the pages of Walker 's Sufferings of the Clergy his name has but small place . The expulsion of incumbents he found for the most part already consummated , but such as had escaped he allowed to remain . The Anglican service was used publicly , and the sermons of Gunning , Fuller and others in the metropolis were thronged4 . Ussher had his library restored to him , and he was told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave politics // alone ' . In Howe royalists and episcopalians found a sort of consul ever ready vigorously to plead their cause . It was pointed out that the country possessed religious freedom ; that that alone had been worth fighting for ; and that those who were meddled with were punished merely for the sake of civil peace3 . I Es breadth of vision is further illustrated by his interference to protect individuals and sects in danger of persecution ' , and by his welcome of the Jews ; in opposition to the prejudices of his contemporaries ' . A final point must be mentioned in connection with the Protector 's political ideals . The three kingdoms were to be drawn closely together , above all through representation in a single assembly . The most friendly relations with New England were maintained , and Cromwell was , perhaps , the first English statesman with a true sense of the importance of the colonies to the mother country ' . With the Dutch Republic , reports of the fabulous prosperity of which were still taken home by travellers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The diplomatic efforts of the Oligarchy had met with scanty success , and the Navigation Act had not induced a more friendly attitude . This feeling of hostility it was Oliver 's special wish to eradicate . Accosting the Dutch ambassador soon after the expulsion of the Rump , he remarked , ' If we two could understand each // other , we would dictate to Europe ' . ' A scheme was accordingly drawn up by the Council , ' not necessitating the alteration of the municipal laws of either , but setting the whole under one superior power , to consist of persons of both nations , and all the subjects of each country having the privileges of the other without any difference distinction . ' When the plan found no response with the Dutch , who were at this time hopelessly divided in their political preferences ' , he brought forward a scheme in which there should be a joint army and navy and free-trade between the two countries . This , in turn , met with such determined opposition that no further attempt at union was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to give entire satisfaction even to those whose affection and admiration for him were unbounded . Since Milton had expressed himself imperfectly satisfied with the rule of the Oligarchy4 , it might have been supposed that he would approve of the form of government which followed it ; and this expectation is at first sight fulfilled . The Defensio Secunda published in 1654 contains a full-length portrait of the Protector . ' He has either extinguished or learned to subdue the whole host of vain hopes , fears and passions which // infest the soul . ' Addressing Oliver directly , he proceeds , ' While you are left among us , that man has no proper trust in God who fears for the security of England . We all willingly yield the palm of sovereignty to your incomparable ability and virtue , except those few who , ambitious of honours they have not the capacity to sustain , envy those conferred on one more worthy than themselves , or who do not know that nothing in the world is more pleasing to God or agreeable to reason than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest . ' Milton is still an ardent Oliverian . No such belief in the wisdom of Parliaments existed in his mind as rendered the very conception of a Protectorate inconsistent with true republicanism . Yet reading between the lines we discover that his satisfaction was not unqualified . If the eulogy on Fairfax , buried in his country-seat , signifies little , the praise of Bradshaw and Sydney , the representatives of Parliamentary republicanism , and of Overton , at the very moment suspected of countenancing plots against the Protector , was different . Milton preferred the political system of Cromwell to that of Bradshaw or Overton , but he desired the incorporation of their persons and certain of their principles in the machine of government . The eulogies mean that Milton was growing conscious that the rule of the Protector was becoming insufficiently national . His two fundamental political principles were that the government of a community should be carried on by all its worthiest members , and that a rational liberty should be secured for the individual . He had already convinced himself that the first was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion that the second might also become endangered . Wittingly and purposely Oliver would not interfere with the liberties over which he had control ; but it was in his power , if his conscience suggested or his policy dictated // that he should do so . If liberty be withheld from conscientious motives , it is none the less withheld . This vein of uneasiness runs through and mingles with the panegyric itself . Reflect often what a dear pledge your land has entrusted to your care ; that liberty she once expected only from the chosen flower of her talents and virtues she now expects from you only and through you alone hopes to obtain . If you , hitherto the tutelary genius of liberty , should hereafter invade it , the general interests of piety and virtue will be affected . In no other way can you perform them so readily , in no other way render our liberty at once so ample and secure , as by associating in your councils the companions of your dangers and toils.V The author , not content with suggesting a reconstitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had Milton pleaded for the entire dissociation of the government from all religious connections in a series of tracts , but had inserted the demand for disestablishment in the forefront of the Sonnet to Cromwell . While religion was connected with civil magistracy , the temple of liberty lacked its roof . As the years passed away without the accomplishment of his wishes , he became more and more convinced that the power to grant or withhold the rights of the people should not lie in the hands of a single man , however disinterested and conscientious ' . His anxiety was further increased by the fact that he hoped nothing from the action of Parliament . Nowhere in his former treatises do we find such outspoken condemnation of the shibboleths of current democracy . The voice of the people was as far from sounding to Milton like the voice of God as to Metternich . Every individual has his birthright to freedom , but for the claim to a share in shaping the destinies of the nation Milton // has as much contempt as Ireton . ' Who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives , ' he asks in a strain of almost cynical disbelief in human nature , ' merely that you might elect the creatures of your own faction whoever they might be , or him , however small might be his worth , who would give you the most lavish feasts and enable you to drink to the greatest excess ? Ought the guidance of the republic to be entrusted to persons to whom nobody would entrust the management of his private concerns , or the treasury left to the care of those who had lavished their own fortunes in infamous prodigality ? Who would suppose he would ever be made a jot more free by such a crew of functionaries2 ? ' , The Defenses Secunda reveals a state of mind that must have been common at this time . ' Despite his admiration for the Protector , Milton is dissatisfied with the rule of a single person ; despite his belief in the sovereignty of the people , he has no faith in representative government . , . ? " OOf those to whom Cromwell had for long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by closer acquaintance . Whitelocke , who lacked the fierce passions and the deep emotions of his age , found himself invited to undertake an important embassy to the Swedish Court . Regarding the proposal as part of it policy of removing obstacles from the ruler 's way , he was unwilling to accept it . If you stay , ' said his old servant , I doubt there may be much danger for you . " Why , what can he do to me ? ' replied Whitelocke . ' What can he do ? What can he not // dol ? ' Following as usual the path of least danger , he set forth on his journey to Sweden . Oxenstierna and the Queen received him kindly2 and pelted him with searching questions . ' I desire to know what stability there is in your government , ' said the Chancellor . ' We hold the government to be the same now , concerning fundamentals , as when we had a king . " But do you hold a kingly government unlawful , that you have abolished it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which the people chooseth is certainly lawful , kingly or other ; and that is best which they make choice of as best . ' How could Whitelocke , asked Christina , take service with a man , who had expelled the Parliament from which he had received his commission ? ' With that I had nothing to do . If his power be unlawful , all the more should I serve my country . ' Such was Whitelocke 's attitude to the Protectorate in its earlier years . The mission was successful , and he returned home in safety to receive the thanks of the Protector . From this time he again became less hostile to Cromwell , and the old friendly relations were gradually resumed . ' Whitelocke , ' says Ranke severely but not unjustly , ' had an irresistible tendency to attach himself to the ruling powers , and to accept personal promotion from them , provided they allowed the system of English Law to remain as a whole such as it was3 . ' His sense of his own importance was flattered . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Lords , and finally became a member of his Council . ' The Protector , ' he writes , often advised with me and a few others about his great businesses , and would be shut up three or four hours together in private discourse . Sometimes he would be very cheerful and laying aside his greatness he would be exceeding familiar with us ; and then he would 1 // fall again to his serious and great business . And this he did often , and our counsel was followed by him in most of his greatest affairs ' . ' On the other hand the Protectorate had in the Commonwealthsmen and the Levellers two implacable enemies . Ludlow 's dislike of Cromwell gradually passed into fanatical hatred . He had at first , he informs us , received no clear account of the events of April 20 , and had known that certain of those who had shared in them were men of principle . He had also considerable hopes of reform in the Church and the Law from the Little Parliament , and had therefore felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promulgation of the Instrument of Government , and the dissolution of the Parliament , the full scope of the revolution was revealed . In his wrath he obstructed the proclamation of the new Government as long as he could , and refused to continue to serve as one of the Commissioners for the government of Ireland . To the suggestion that he should wait and see how the usurper would use his power , he replied that nothing could be reasonably expected of him ' . He turned conspirator and dispersed incendiary pamphlets against the government ' . After repeated interviews with Henry Cromwell and Fleetwood ' , and repeated refusals to surrender his commission , he was allowed an interview with the Protector . The unflinching republican reiterated the opinions which he was well known to entertain . He could not sign an agreement that he would not // // act when he met with any power , superior to the existent , from which he could expect the good of mankind . ' But who shall be judge of that ? ' asked Lambert ; we ourselves think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Ludlow replied that everybody must govern himself by the light of his own reason ' . At the second interview , a few weeks later , the same impasse was quickly reached . ' What can you desire more than you have ? ' asked the Protector . ' That which we fought for , ' said Ludlow , ? ' that the nation might he governed by its own consent . " I am as much for a government by consent as any man , ' returned Oliver ; ' but where shall we find that consent ? ' Ludlow , no doubt sincerely believing that he was indicating a practicable policy , replied , ' Among those who have acted with fidelity and affection to the public ' . ' The greater number of the party soon after attempted to take their pla s in Oliver 's second Parliament , but were excluded . ' Has such s blow , ' asked an indignant pamphlet after furnishing the particulars , ' ever been given to the freedom of the nation since the Norman Conquests ? ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluding scene was worthy of its entire duration . The hypocrite manifested so little remorse of conscience for his betrayal of the public cause and sacrificing it to the idol of his ambition that some of his last words were rather becoming a mediator than a sinner , recommending to God the condition of the nation that he had so infamously cheated and expressing a great care of the people whom he had so manifestly despised4 . ' It is a fact of special interest and importance that Vane began his public career in New England . Crossing the Atlantic when . The Republicans and the Protectorate 2 t scarcely more than a boy , though setting forth with well-defined intentions ' , he was without delay appointed Governor of Massachusetts . At his return , hopes were expressed that he had left his ' former misguided opinions behind him2 ' ; and indeed there is no evidence that he brought back more than a vague mysticism from his three years ' sojourn ' . But events moved fast , and in the summer of 1644 he was chosen to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or virtual deposition of the king . Vane was a revolutionary ; but he abhorred revolutionary violences , and protested against the execution of Charles . For six weeks , ' said he later , ' I was absent from my seat here , out of tenderness of blood ? . ' He was none the less the most influential civilian member of the government which followed the death of the king . It was only when he was excluded from public life that he seems to have commenced systematic thinking . The Retired Man 's Meditations were the earliest fruit of the two years of enforced leisure spent at Raby and Belleau . The single chapter dedicated to politics is of singular interest ' . Magistracy ' hath its place and bears its part in the reign of Christ over mens , ' before the Fall as after . For it is not only useful to restrain from unrighteousness and disorder occasioned by sin , hut also to conserve men in the good order and right disposition of things wherein by their creation they were placed " . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise . ' When the Scriptures say the rule of magistrates is over men , we are to understand the proper bounds and limits of . 14 ? z 2 r 2 Monarchy without Kingship the office , which is , not to intrude themselves into the office and proper concerns of Christ 's inward government and rule in the conscience , but to content itself with the outward man . It ought not therefore to be condemned or disobeyed by any as accounting it a part of the Fourth Monarchy ' . ' Passing from the general to the particular , Vane expresses a cheerful confidence that the difficulties through which the nation has passed arc designed for some commensurate purpose . ' lie hath not emptied us from vessel to vessel without some teaching thereby what was bad and may he left behind , nor without some dawnings and intimations of what is good and is yet before us , to be prosecuted and followed after . God can not leave us when the work has come , as it were , to the birth , and is upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common good of men ' . ' In the following year the Protector invited suggestions for the improvement of the machinery of government , and Vane composed and published his Healing Question ' . Cromwell had contemplated proposals of a strictly limited scope , and was altogether unprepared for a fully developed rival system . What possibility remained , asked Vane , of reconciling and uniting the judgments of honest men within the three kingdoms who still pretended to agree in the spirit , justice and reason of the same good Cause as of old ? Neither blood nor treasure should be thought too dear to keep it from sinking . What was the Cause ? ' The whole body of honest men are to enjoy the freedom to set up meet persons in the place of supreme authority , whereby they may have the benefit of the choicest light and wisdom of the nation for the government under which they will live . ' The government being composed of the right men , it must act in the right way . In a good government , naturally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protectorate t 3 are therefore to be confined to those who have on all occasions shewed themselves lovers of freedom in civil and spiritual things . Once elected they were to be supreme . ' None are judges of the power of Parliaments , ' said Vane at his trial , ' but themselves . Admit their judgment may be called in question by private persons , the fundamentals of government are plucked up by the roots ' . ' According to their will the supreme power may , of course , be placed in one or a few . The new regime is to be founded by a great Convention , wherein fundamental constitutions shall be agreed upon and subscribed . ' This uncompromising work , for such it was , though its author may have been a ' quiet , harmless , dove-like persons , ' met with a response in the country only comparable to that of Killing no Murder . On September 4 , Vane was summoned before the Council on the charge of writing a seditious book tending to the disturbance of the governments . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in very dark and mysterious terms , as his manner was . His arrest was a necessity , not only for peace but to let the nation sec that those who govern are in good earnest ' . ' Vane found himself unable to give security not to act against the government ' , and the refusal was followed by a few months ' imprisonment . From this time forward , he was an uncompromising antagonist of the Protectorate . Henry Cromwell told Thurloe that he expected he would ally with the Quakers against the Government ' . That he engaged in Royalist plots is improbable . A few weeks after his departure from Carisbrook , it was suggested to Hyde by one of his agents that the king should // write letters of grace to him ' . If this was done , Vane seems to have taken no notice of it . Far more dangerous was the opposition of the Levellers , who had recently broken up into two parties . Immediately after his trial , it had been reported that Lilburne had a hand in the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his banishment in 1652 the rumours again began to circulate ' . Authentic accounts , however , of what he said or promised are lacking . Here is a specimen of the rumours , introduced by the confession that the story was at second hand . ' I am told , ' wrote Secretary Nicholas4 , ' that Lilburne said that if the king will promise if he be restored he will put all his castles , ships and militia into the hands of the people and be governed by Parliament in all affairs , he will undertake to make him king , having , as he saith , 40,000 men that will rise on these conditions . ' While he may have mixed in royalist circles , there is no real evidence that he ever plotted to restore the king ' . On the expulsion of the Rump , Lilburne , considering his sentence to be terminated , returned to England , only , however , to find himself immediately arrested . The general impression was that he had at last brought his neck into a noose ' and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to be as great as ever . The trial provoked extraordinary excitement . Twenty citizens offered bail of ? 2000 each ' . To a judge 's remark that h ? would be The Republicans and the Protectorate 2 I S executed it was rejoined that it would be the bloodiest day England had ever seen ' . During the trial , three regiments stood under arms and six or seven thousand citizens were estimated to be present , many of them armed ' . The crucial nature of the struggle was obvious even to foreigners ' . The incidents of the trial were very much like those of the former ; but on the present occasion , Lilburne succeeded in procuring a copy of the indictment , which he proceeded to lay before Counsel , ? a feat , as Sir James Stephen reminds us , achieved by nobody else before the Bill of Rights . The conduct of the judges , as before , gave him opportunities of which he was not slow to avail himself . In the narrative which he published shortly after , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what they had to do with the Law of God ' . That his acquittal was followed by renewed banishment , though for the peace of the nation ' , ' raised public indignation to the highest pitch . It was not to be imagined how much esteem he had got for vindicating the ancient laws and liberties " . The Protector , comments Clarendon justly , looked on it as a greater defeat than the loss of a battle ' . Lilburne was sent over to Jersey and so strictly guarded that no more was heard of him than if he had been dead ' . His memory , // however , remained , and the Government organ chronicles illustrations of the Lilburnian spirit ' . ' At intervals a pamphlet from his busy pen would appear in London , repeating that all commonwealths were weak where injuries were daily offered to the people , or defending himself from charges of turbulency of spirit ' . At times , too , a petition for his release would be presented ' . Whatever the Government had contemplated in the agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1657 he received permission to return to England and died , a member of the Quaker body , in the summer of 1658 , a few days before his great enemy ' . Far less respectable was the conduct of the main body of the party . Fulfilling certain prognostications , its members became royalist intriguers in indignation at the establishment of the Council of States . In September , 1649 , Hyde forwarded to Nicholas a paper which he had drawn up to serve in any negotiations with the Levellers that might ensue . There were several reasons why application should be made to this party in preference to any other . Their propositions were extravagant and impracticable , and would for the most part fall of themselves . Since they were great enemies to arbitrary government , they would gradually be reduced to a reverence for the laws . Above all , they had power and interest in the Army and Navy and // many towns and garrisons ' . Negotiations were soon on foot , for in the same month the Council of State warned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all parts of the country by joint endeavours with the Levellers2 . The negotiations thus begun in 1649 grew to importance in 1655 , when they became focussed around the personality of Sex by , whom Thurloe recognised as a great foe of the government and whose papers he begged his agents to strain every nerve to secure ' . Declaring that he would be contented to see the king reinvested with all his legal rights , so that the people were assured of their liberties ? , Sexby was naturally welcomed with open arms ' . The royalists were penniless and the Spaniards were called in to finance the scheme . It was known that Spaniards , Cavaliers , Papists and Levellers ' had entered into a confederacy , and that Sexby had undertaken the assassination of the Protectors , and the surrender of a port and garrison ' . Turning to the actual history of the intrigues revealed in the Clarendon papers , we derive the impression that the danger from this quarter was rather less than it appeared to those who knew little about its . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Levellers insisted that the king should abolish tithes and episcopacy and surrender his veto ' . The royalists no less decisively refused to promise to alter the fundamental government of the kingdom , to the support of which nine-tenths of the people were really disposed ' . The other difficulty was equally unsurmountable . Spain refused to supply any considerable sum till the Levellers began operations , while the Levellers professed themselves unable to effect anything without money . The original plan had included an invasion combined with the murder of Cromwell ; but as time slipped by , the programme was lightened by throwing over everything but the latter design ' . Several of the royalists pretended to believe that this was on the point of execution ' , but the confident assertions of Sexby lost impressiveness by repetition ' . He had founded his hopes on the acceptance of the kingship by the Protector , and after his refusal he grew morose and altered ' . In the summer of the same year , the grand traitor ' was captured as he was crossing over to Holland7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talbot to Hyde , ' is very great ; but the business is not lost ' . ' With the arrest of Sexby , the story not only of the Levellers ' intrigues with the royalists but of the Levellers themselves comes to an end . Those who remained alive took no part in the resistance to the Restoration or threw in their lot with the Commonwealthsmen2 , and the one manifesto put forth by professing Levellers in the year of anarchy bears a closer relationship to Harrington than to Lilburne3 . . CHAPTER IX The . Jew Religious Bodies IN addition to the discontented republicans the Protectorate had foes of a widely different character to face . At the end of the first decade of the great struggle the Independents had been the dominant sect ; at the beginning of the second , they were so no longer ' . For many Independency served merely as a halting-place on their passage from the Church to other religious bodies , of which the Millenarians , the Baptists and the Quakers were the most prominent2 . I The very name of Millenarians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy . The fourth monarchy was drawing to its close , and was to be followed by the reign of the saints . In view of this great certainty all political arrangements now in being become of necessity transitory . So far all were agreed . But the Millenarians of the English revolution , like the Millenarians of the German Reformation , split into two sections on a further question . What was to be their attitude towards the existing order of things ? Should they quietly await The Millenarians and the Baptists 22 I the arrival of the inevitable ? Or should they endeavour to hasten its advent by combating the powers which occupied the place it was destined to fill ? " T is certain , ' wrote Thurloe to Henry Cromwell in 1655 , that the Fifth Monarchy Men , some of them I mean , have designs of putting us into blood ' . ' Of the two wings thus indicated the more moderate may be traced in the camp after Naseby . The new opinion , if not welcomed by Cromwell for selfish purposes as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread widely through the army . Harrison , Overton and other leaders became its adherents , and Fleetwood was suspected of something more than sympathy . About the time of the king 's death a revolutionary wing began to emerge . One of its members declared that the form and not the power of monarchy had disappeared , and that Parliament was no less absolute and tyrannical Another proclaimed that nobles and mighty men were about to become subject to the saints , that it was lawful to combat Christ 's enemies with the material sword , and that the saints should then possess riches and reign with Him on earth ' . The penman of the party , John Rogers , had been ejected as an Anglican , had turned Presbyterian , and on the growth of Millenarianism had become a convert ' . Sagriror Domesday drawing nigh professed to expose the ungodly laws of the fourth monarchy and the approach of the fifth . The origin of all good laws was in the people , but successive conquests had robbed them of their rights ' . The two plagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would need to be removed before the Church of // Christ could be reformed . The fourth monarchy was breaking up apace and would suddenly ' tumble and kick its heels in the air . ' By 1666 the fifth would be visible throughout the world , and in about 40 years it would have prevailed . Men therefore should buy no more lands nor estates , seeing it would ' make such mad work in the world ' . ' In a treatise which immediately followed , the duties of the saints in preparation for the event are described . It was most important that they should belong to no religious organisation2 . No compulsion was to be exercised either over action or thought , for the worst heretic might live to reform . Magistrates , indeed , were superfluous3 . Harrison 's share in the expulsion of the Rump , together with Rogers ' hopeful appeal to the Protector and the extreme gentleness of Cromwell 's references to the sect 4 , prove that the party , if not an active supporter of the new regime , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of the erection of a Council of Seventy , in imitation of the Sanhedrim , in accordance with the wishes of Harrison ' , the Millenarians fixed their hopes on the Barebones Parliament , which consisted to a large extent of their own adherents ' . Nor did the assembly disappoint their expectations ' . It attacked the clergy ; it demanded the abolition of Chancery ; it declared nobility contrary to the Law of Nature . In a word their prate was to make way for Christ 's Monarchy on earth ? . ' On the dissolution of the Parliament the left wing of the The Millenarians and the Baptists 22 3 party entered upon a career of the utmost violence . Harrison began to plot and was arrested . Rogers denounced Cromwell as AntiChrist , the Man of Sin , the Great Dragon ' . The party increased rapidly , and drew to itself many of the most violent and desperate spirits ' . Men impoverished by long troubles , ' wrote Pell at this time , ' must needs have great propensions to hearken to those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ and the saints , especially as so many prophecies are applied to these times . The end of Paganism was in 395 , to which they add 1260 . Others pitch on 1656 , because the lives of the patriarchs in Genesis make this number . Therefore Christ will come this year or next ' . ' The party first rushed into the arms of the Levellers , and meetings were held to discuss common principles of action with a view to taking arms ' ; but the negotiations were interrupted by a series of arrests ' . Nor did the relations with the more turbulent members of the Baptist party about the same time have any practical issue . The Millenarians were strong enough to stand alone . As early as the autumn of 1653 , an anonymous correspondent had warned the Protector against danger from asecret assembly at Blackfriars7 . The agent whom Thurloe dispatched heard Feake and Powell explain the position of the party . Lord , ' prayed Feake , ' Thou hast suffered us to cut off the head which reigned over us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rule over us in the . // head 's place ' . ' The preachers were arrested2 , but when Needham again visited the meeting he found things little changed . ' The place was crowded , the humours boiling , and as much scum came off as ever . ' Though it was but a confluence of silly wretches , ' he recommended the total suppression of the meetings . Feake 's temporary detention did not moderate the violence of his utterances and , on being once more arrested , he declared at his trial that God would destroy not only unlawful but lawful Government , not only the abuse but the use of it ' . A diminution in their popularity , however , seems to have followed the outburst of violence , and , in the summer of 1656 , Thurloe wrote that their credit and numbers were declining5 . Their fanaticism , however , remained the same . In the same year a report of a meeting reached Thurloe in which it was debated when was the time for destroying Babylon and its adherents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had concluded that the saints must do it , the time to be now and the means the swords . ' The resolution was soon put into practice , for in April , 1657 , occurred their first insurrection . ' The number and quality of the persons engaged , ' runs Thurloe 's report to the Council , ' were truly very inconsiderable and indeed despicable . Though they speak great words of the reign of the saints , and seem to invite none but the holy seed , yet the baits they lay to catch men are the taking away customs , excise , taxes , tithes ' ' . ' The enactment of the Petition and Advice inflamed them to still greater heights of daring . Rumours that Harrison , Okey , Rogers and Canne had proclaimed // their resolutions to destroy all who should oppose them were frequent ' . These incendiaries , ' wrote Henry Cromwell , are very dangerous and of an inveterate temper ' . ' Baillie feared that if the party increased there would be wholesale slaughters ' . A Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contain the names of individuals marked for destruction ' . Pagitt found it necessary to alter the account he had given of the opinions of Millenaries in earlier editions of his Heresiography . They now taught that all the ungodly must be killed , and that the wicked had no property in their estate ' . In this turbid torrent one pamphlet alone had pretensions to sanity ? . The writer , returning to the idea of Harrison , desires a Sanhedrim or Supreme Council , men of choicest light and spirit . ' Borrowing a principle to which the Levellers had given currency , he withheld the-power of altering the foundations of common right and freedom , religious liberty chief among them . Popular control was to be further guaranteed by the rotation of G I5 // the councillors and the absence of an executive . With this exception , the party never paused to consider the trivialities of constitution-making . Closely allied to the Millenarians at this time , in popular belief , were the ' Anabaptists . ' The coup d'etat of 1653 was welcomed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wrote to the Protector that they had ' groaned ' under the recent government were telling the truth or were merely attempting to curry favour ' , many of the party were at this time closely connected with Harrison , who was the chief author of the revolution2 . The majority remained quiet if not contented . In a representation sent to the Protector on the rumour getting abroad that he intended to purge the army , the authors challenged him to declare when their church had been unfaithful to him ' . So far as there was a revolutionary wing to the party during the Protectorate , it was to be found in the army that was stationed in Ireland ' , though here , as everywhere , the mistake of confusing the general with the particular is possible . At the end of 1653 it was considered that in the plot to set up an Anabaptist general the greater part of the soldiers was engaged ' . Their conduct made people declare that their pride and uncharitableness would ere long bring them low ' . Henry Cromwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , complained that they openly denied the position of his father and reviled those who recognised him2 . The connection with the Fifth Monarchy Men was still very close , many conversions from one party to the other being recorded3 . Towards the end of the Protectorate , however , the violence , activity and importance of the radical party seems to have diminished ' . Multitudes of those who had been classed as Baptists became Quakers , and a final blow was given to the left wing when Monk purged his army ? . Except in the case of Canne , who was more a Millenarian than a Baptist , every authoritative declaration of principle leads us to regard the English Baptists as an orderly and relatively conservative society ? . Baxter , no friend of the party , con fessed that most of them were persons of zest in religion and godly , sober people , and differed from others but in the point of infant baptism ' . ' Though Jeremy Taylor selects them as an example of an exception that might have to he made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that it was unlawful to take up defensive arms , to kill malefactors , to take oaths , and other tenets soon to become characteristic of the most peaceable of 15-2 // men ' . The typical Baptist is to be found , not among those who haunted the meetings of the Millenarians , but in such men as Tombes , the friend of Clarendon and Sanderson , in the learned Jessey , and in the saintly Hanserd Knollys . II The most important incident in the religious history of the second decade of the revolution was the rise of the Quakers2 . The commonest theories of their origin were that they sprang from the Anabaptists or the Ranters . That they did not respect the laws of the land was the ground of their supposed relationship with the former ' ; that they set the dictation of an inward monitor above the established conventionalities of thought and phrase seemed to point to a connection with the latter ' . Though Baxter , after giving an account of the Ranters , naively adds that they were so few that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were but the same party with another name ' . On the ogler hand , Roger Williams made the sect the mother , not the ( laughter , of ' Rantism ' . ' Pagitt gave up the attempt to determine . // their relationship , and contented himself with declaring that the Ranters and Quakers were unclean beasts , much of the same puddle ' . ' To calmer observers it is obvious that the new movement most nearly resembled the Mennonist Church whence the Baptists had sprung2 . So close is the connection indeed between these sister bodies that it is sometimes said that Fox was rather the organiser than the founder of the new society . The General Baptists went over almost in a body to the Friends , taking many of their own ideas and practices with them ' . The relationship is further illustrated by the fact that , in the rare instances where Quakers deserted their communion , t hey rejoined the Baptists4 . Yet , though the framework was to some extent borrowed and adapted , the spirit which animated the leaders distinguished it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of every church when the feeling that the spiritual life of the individual is being lost behind the machinery of its organisation leads to a protest , which in certain cases produces a permanent separation from the main body . From this point of view Quakerism was as inevitable in England as Pietism in Germany . It was pledged to no definite opinions , observances or organisation . The wayfaring man , as described by Fox , had visited in turn the Papists , the Common-prayer men , the Presbyterians , the Independents , the Baptists , but by none had he been told that the only religion was that of spirit and of truths . So great was the revolution involved in these words that even a man of moderate principles // like Thorndike declared that the Quakers were not to be reckoned as Christians at all ' . The dream of Luther was first realised in England in all its fulness and clearness in the Quaker movement . ' What ! ' asks Fox in a letter , realising that the words may seem strange to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Christians ' . ' From this principle the rest follows as a matter of course . In the first place , the movement appealed to the poorer classes as no other had done . Against no other sect does Pagitt bring the accusation that it was ' made up of the dregs of the common people ' . ' As one of its more friendly critics pointed out , it did the magistrates yeoman service in reclaiming ' such as neither Magistrate nor Minister ever speak to4 . ' Distinctions of sex no less than position were obliterated by this all-embracing equalitarianism ' . In the same letter as that in which he stated that all Christians were priests , Fox asks , ' Are women priests ? ' and answers , ' Yes ; women are priests ' . ' A further distinction was equally inadmissible . Clarkson used to say that Fox was the first Englishman publicly to declare against slavery , and more than one slave-owner received a letter severely declaring that God was no respecter of persons ' .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
