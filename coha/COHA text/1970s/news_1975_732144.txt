Thus , the United States continues to show a marked difference from some other industrial nations , including Britain . The feeling here seems to be that both labor and management have much to lose by lengthy disputes . The degree of obduracy on both sides to be found in Britain , for example , seems lacking . Unions in such important-to-the-economy areas as rubber , automotive , farm equipment , and electrical manufacturing indicate that they recognize management problems with inflation and unemployment . While they will press for higher wages , they show little enthusiasm for long walkouts that could end up making the rank-and-file union member ' suffer . They . will , however , stress higher pensions , increased benefits of other kinds , and shorter workweeks . Employers , on the other hand , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid price hikes and to encourage more production . This , they say , means more jobs . At the same time , employers are likely to prefer a larger-than-desired wage settlement to a production shutdown at the very moment they are poised to take advantage of the gradual economic upturn in the nation . Contract bargaining in 1976 will involve some of the country 's most militant unions . The negotiations will be much heavier than those in 1975 , an unusually light year in which strikes have declined by 15 percent from 1973 and 1974 levels . " No major strikes of long duration are probable in major industries next year , " W. S. Usery , head of the Federal Mediation and // * More strikes but shorter in ' 76 // Conciliation Service said in Washington a few days ago .

Despite the wave of teacher and public-employee strikes , most union rank-and-file members show little enthusiasm now for costly strikes . They worry about depleting savings in a time of rising prices and about possible job losses if employers shut down rather than accept higher labor costs . The reluctance to undertake long and hard strikes will not be reflected outwardly when labor bargains with major industries .
