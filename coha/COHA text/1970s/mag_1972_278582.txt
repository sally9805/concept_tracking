ALIGHTHEARTED , relaxed garden town studded with classic temples and pagodas and elegant villas , Hangchow ( pop.800,000 ) is China 's Florence . Famous for its silks and teas , Hangchow is a favorite resort of China 's leaders . Mao Tse-tung frequently retires to his retreat on mist-shrouded West Lake , sometimes merely to escape the rigors of the capital , sometimes to hold informal , substantive meetings with foreign visitors after the Peking formalities are out of the way . <P> West Lake , ringed by hills of transcendental beauty , is the centerpiece of a city redolent with memories of imperial history . Marco Polo , who saw Hangchow in the 13th century before it was savaged by Mongol invaders , found it " the most splendid city in the world . " Its streets were " as smooth as the floor of a ballroom , " its waters were rippled by " an endless procession of barges. " its courtiers were " intent upon nothing but bodily pleasure and the delights of society . " <P> The Nixons , who will probably stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking West Lake , will find the ambience somewhat different . In 1921 , a group of young intellectuals from Shanghai met secretly on a sampan on nearby South Lake to organize the Chinese Communist Party . Today , the only people in Hangchow visibly intent on bodily pleasure are the shadowboxers who materialize in the lakeside parks to exercise every morning .
