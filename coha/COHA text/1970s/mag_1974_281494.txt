The great American population explosion may have fizzled , but copulation seems to be more popular than ever . In 1965 , the federally funded National Fertility Study , which polled some 5,000 women , reported that the frequency of sexual intercourse for married women under 45 in the U.S. averaged 6.8 times a month . A follow-up study reveals what the country 's married couples have been doing since then . On the basis of interviews with 4,000 women in every social and economic class and a comparison of the yearly rates of unwanted pregnancies by couples who do not practice birth control , Charles Westoff of Princeton University 's Office of Population Research concludes that Americans made love more often in the five years ending in 1970 than they did in 1965 . The frequency of intercourse is up 20% , to nearly 8.2 times a month .
