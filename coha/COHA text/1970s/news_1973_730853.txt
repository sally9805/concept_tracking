txt Julie Nixon Eisenhower says her father considered resigning over Watergate but his ? family talked him out of it . They felt it would be an " admission of wrongdoing " and that he was needed in the Presidency . She said the question of the President resigning came up at a family gathering at Camp David , their mountaintop retreat , on May 4 . " He was playing the devil 's advocate one evening , saying . . . Well , see , the thing is , he really loves the country and he 'd do anything . . . that was best for the country . You know , he would say ' Should I resign ? Would it be better for the country ? Would the wounds heal faster ? Would it the country be able to move faster to other things . ' " WE SAID NO . We did n't think he should because resigning would be an admission of wrongdoing and we also ' felt , that he was the man for the job and he had started things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind Of person . I think it was more than just a rhetorical question . I think he really thought ' Will this end everything ? ' . " She dismissed as " ludicrous " the . White House political " enemies " list disclosed in the Senate Watergate hearings and said the President is " too busy to be consumed with petty paranoid concerns . " " SOMETHING LIKE the political enemies list just drives me up the wall , " she said in an interview Tuesday , " because I really believe my father is not that kind of a person . " " I think events are going to vindicate him , " she said . " I 'm really not concerned . I believe that . " The President 's daughter said she believes the press is " obsessed with Watergate " and did not focus enough attention on the recent Nixon summit meeting with Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev . Julie was interviewed by two wire service reporters over a chef 's salad lunch at the San Clemente Inn two days before her 25th birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she thought her father " was terribly distressed and shaken because of the things he found out in March . " She said the conversation about resigning took place just four days after the President ousted his top aides , H. R. Haldeman , John Ehrllchman , and John Dean . " The fact that he had to completely reorganize his staff . . . that he depended heavily on , that is no longer there , " she went on , " and he has certain working patterns and did things thru his staff system . It 's very orderly and an organized way of working . It 's difficult to have an upheaval . " WHAT STRUCK him  --  the most ? " Just realizing what the whole Watergate thing was , " she said . " He was just really in the dark . - " My father just had complete faith in everyone around him , " she said , explaining why It took the President so long to realize something was wrong . " I guess that 's part of the whole tragedy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was being assured that no one else in the White House was involved . " Does the first family discuss Watergate at the dinner table , she was asked . " I REMEMBER ONE time at the very beginning when he was making the statement about how it touched so many people .. . end you know being unaware of it and a lot of good people with good motives who just used incredibly bad judgment , " she said . " They were n't out for personal gain and that 's part of the tragedy , " Julie said . " I think that 's hurt him deeply too . . . to see these men , you know , finished as far as any kind of government job or political . . . " When asked if the President had made any judgments of who let him down , she replied : " No , he has n't . And I do n't know if he has in his own mind , but he has n't discussed it with any of us . I think be 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly . " " I THINK ONE thing that 's terribly Important is that we try to wait until all the facts are out , " she said . ' " The press had to print what Dean was saying . Right . They had to print things that were leaked because its news . " But I think that what 's bad is that some people have been prejudged , you know , in the minds of others , " she added . " In other words there are always going to be members of the public who are going to say ' Well , this Is the gospel truth , or this is what happens , ' so I think you have to be careful . " As for Nixon 's attitude toward Dean , the former counsel who implicated the President in the coverup , she said , " Well , I think the fact that Dean was asked to resign speaks for itself . " The President 's present mood , she said , is " very good . He 's moving ahead , and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes another statement on Watergate . I think that 's only fair , not to prejudge . " SHE SAID THE " thing that 's really sad " is that the President , " has always run his own political campaign . And this time he did not . " He really did not campaign , " she said . " Ile really was not involved . He let hg campaign organization run it . " Julie said it was " one of the real tragedies " of Watergate that the campaign organization is " getting a black eye " and hurting the campaign workers who " are being brought down , too . " Julie said that she does not believe the President ever approved the " enemies list . " " I HAVE N'T asked him about that but first of all it 's so ludicrous , the idea of an enemy list because everyone knows who is opposed to the administration and who is a friend , " she said . " Writing about this just makes it sound so underhanded and all . I just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her future . . . Mrs. Eisenhower turns 25 today . feel it 's a fair representation because I know my father , and the kind of man he is , and he 's not that way . " Julie said Americans " should be disturbed " about the burglary and bugging of the Democratic party headquarters and the coverup , but added : " What really disturbs me greatly is that I feel the press has made a hero out of Daniel Eilsberg . He stole documents the Pentagon papers . He broke the law . It was a question df national security . This could have had much greater consequences than bugging the Democratic headquarters . The bugging was ludicrous . I do n't know what they thought they were going to find out . The whole stupidity of it is just unreal . " S H E STRONGLY defended diplomatic secrecy and wiretapping " If it is a question of national security , " but added she feels that the Nixon administration has been unfairly accused of " national security taps that have been going on since Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rash of newspaper stories concerning the federal government expenditures on the Nixon 's Key Biscayne , Fla. , and San Clemente villas . She said that the spending on security measures had been looked into on Capitol Hill and found to be " above board . "
