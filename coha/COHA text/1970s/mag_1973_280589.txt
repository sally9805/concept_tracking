" With every decade , the length of schooling has increased , until a thoughtful person must ask whether society can conceive of no other way for youth to come into adulthood . " So writes Sociologist James Coleman , chairman of the Panel on Youth of the President 's Science Advisory Committee . Best known for his controversial 1966 study of minority schooling , Coleman , 47 , is a longtime student of American youth . In a new report , he and his team of nine social scientists and educators recommend more work and less school for young Americans aged 14 to 24 . <P> The trouble with school , argues Coleman , is that its focus is too narrow . At their best , schools equip the young with basic skills , some knowledge of their heritage , and a taste for learning . But schools are not designed to provide such adult necessities as the ability to manage one 's own affairs or to engage in " intense , concentrated involvement in an activity . " Nor are they the place for learning how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools not only fail to develop these capabilities , says the Coleman panel , but by monopolizing young people 's time , they also prevent them from acquiring skills elsewhere . Until about 50 years ago , a child learned how to be an adult in his life outside school , especially within his family . But the family no longer serves this function , and " school has expanded to fill the time that other activities once occupied without substituting for them . " Segregated by age , today 's young are saturated with information but starved for experience . <P> Although changing the schools themselves ( for instance , by creating specialized schools and using students as tutors ) could broaden their role , says the panel , the best remedy is to limit schooling and provide opportunities for the young to alternate study with work . <P> Participation in serious and responsible work with people of different backgrounds and ages would promote adult capabilities and counteract the isolation and passivity of school . <P> The panel 's most provocative proposal is to get the young out of schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestras , department stores and factories all are urged to experiment with such a plan , taking on youngsters from age 16 , using them for whatever labor they can perform , while teaching them further skills and overseeing their formal schooling . This approach would represent a fundamental shift away from the traditional American view of education as a means of secular salvation . It might also be a move toward an even older pattern-apprenticeship . <P> Coleman himself goes beyond the panel 's proposal to urge the development of working communities that encompass all ages . An organization of 1,000 persons would include 90 infants four and under , 180 aged five to 13 and 100 oldsters over 65 . While producing goods and services , such Utopian units could also " bring down to humane size " the care of the young and elderly . As a model Coleman cites the residential community of the Society of Brothers , in upstate New York , which manufactures commercial toys . Unlike theirs , however , his groups would function only during the normal workday.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
