Vinyl chloride is a colorless gas that has been used as a propellant in such popular products as hair , disinfectant and insect sprays . It is also the principal ingredient of polyvinyl chlorides , the plastics that go into a host of familiar products including food wrappers and containers , suitcases , detergent bottles and garbage bags . No one questions vinyl chloride 's utility , but a growing number of doctors now suspect its safety . Increasing evidence links vinyl chloride to a crippling bone disease and a rare but invariably fatal form of cancer . <P> Evidence of vinyl chloride 's toxicity has been around for years . Production of polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) was begun in 1938 by B.F. Goodrich Co . That year experiments showed that the vinyl chloride gas used at the plant was dangerous to animals . A 1949 Russian study showed that vinyl chloride ( VC ) caused nonmalignant liver damage in 15 of 48 workers exposed to the chemical ; surveys in other European countries over the next decade and a half confirmed the connection . In 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence of acro-osteolysis , a condition partially characterized by distortion of the skin and bones of the fingers and feet . <P> Mini-Epidemic . The connection between VC and cancer was first made in 1970 by Publio L. Viola of the University of Rome , who found tumors in the lungs , skin and bones of rats exposed to high concentrations of the gas . The link was strengthened in 1973 when researchers from Bonn University found evidence of liver damage in 19 out of 20 PVC workers at a single plant . The bombshell really burst early this year when B.F. Goodrich Co. reported that three men who worked with VC in its Louisville , Ky. , plastics plant had died of angiosarcoma of the liver since 1971 . Since then doctors have identified nine more cases of the cancer in the U.S. , one in Great Britain and another in Norway . <P> Their findings are all the more significant because angiosarcoma of the liver is so rare that it has been reported only about 100 times in medical history ; a major hospital in Los Angeles found only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen closely linked cases thus constitutes a sort of mini epidemic of the disease . Since such cancers may not develop for at least 15 years after initial exposure , environmental health researchers suspect that more cases will be uncovered . Says J. William Lloyd , of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) : " I would suspect that this is going to be the occupational disease of the century . " <P> His prediction could prove correct , for in the U.S. alone some 6,500 workers are involved in making VC gas or converting the gas into PVC ; thousands more are engaged in converting the plastic into finished products . European and Japanese firms are also heavily involved in VC production . <P> Whopping Levels . So far , at least , there is no clear evidence that consumers are in any danger from VC . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have , as a precautionary measure , put a halt to the distribution of spray products using VC propellants. * The FDA had already ordered companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic . Other PVC products offered to the consumer have yet to be proved unsafe .
