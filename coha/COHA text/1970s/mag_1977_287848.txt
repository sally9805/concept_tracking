To anyone who has grown up male in the United States , driving an automobile transcends the rather rudimentary coordination one needs to stay in lane on highways . For reasons that swell Freudian literature , driving becomes a symbolic , even a sexual act . ( Praised be the soft enchantress who likes the way we shift . ) <P> Marxist sociologists suggest that we see ourselves in the cars we choose . Young , assertive , loud , one is a Triumph or a Porsche . As we become more burdened , we evolve into Ford station wagons . Last seen of all that ends this strange eventful history , a man becomes a settled sedan : perhaps a Seville . Perhaps a used 1967 Chevy . <P> Not wanting to give too much away , I own a sedate efficient diesel sedan and retain an interest in a sports car that speaks in the hollow thunder of youth . Until recently I guided each with macho faith and precious little knowledge . After three hours of instruction , concentrated mostly on parking , I obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply drove . Most of us simply drive . We study tennis , dancing , golf . We simply drive . <P> " We have seen studies on highway deaths , " says Jacques Couture , an athletic , bearded Quebecois of 37 , who presides at the Jim Russell International Racing Drivers School , near Mont Tremblant . " Speed is only the No. 3 factor . Equipment failure is second . According to these studies , the deadliest killer is driver error . " <P> <P> Along with ten others , I had enrolled in Couture 's " high performance " program . You begin by wondering how much anyone can absorb in three days . You conclude with fatigue , a sense of achievement and at length a kind of horror . For years you have been driving out of control without realizing it . <P> Driving , Couture suggests , should ultimately become a system of controlled reflexes . Developing the reflexes is " not a matter of guts , but of brains . Ideally you sit behind the wheel like a computer . " Safety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First finish . Then finish first . " - We walked the track , Couture explaining , always explaining , how to attack each bend , each kink . Then he drove us to the cars : Formula Fords , long-nosed fiber-glass machines that weigh about 950 lbs . and are powered by a standard Pinto engine . Formula Fords are stripped for speed : no windscreen , no headlights , no speedometer ( a tachometer is your guide ) . <P> You climb into a cockpit , strap in and start the car . You shift upward , first , second , third , fourth and then down . Gas . Clutch . Shift . Now gas , clutch , gas again . Downshift . You are learning how to double-clutch . You are learning to control a car . You cease to hear the swallows . Your universe becomes an asphalt strip . It will be afternoon before Couture regards you as competent to corner in a Formula Ford . <P> Each turn on track or highway has its own geometry . It has a theoretical maximum speed . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you , it may be hard to visualize , but there is a specific technique for attacking , say , a 90 right turn . Approach down the extreme left . Brake and downshift from fourth to third . Brake and downshift third to second . Steady throttle . Now turn at an angle that touches the inside shoulder at the very center-the apex-of the corner . Accelerate out . Unwind the wheel . Breathe .
