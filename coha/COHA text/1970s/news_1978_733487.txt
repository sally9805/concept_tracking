txt While mental health officials in Albany and New York 's City Hall continue to point accusing fingers at one another , life for the mentally ill in the city grows steadily more dismal . Governor Carey 's new plan to spend $11.4 million more in services for former state mental patients is welcome but overdue and inadequate . What New York City needs is not just a few million dollars sprinkled over a sprawling system that consumes more than $400 million a year . It needs a serious effort , led by Mayor Koch and the Governor , to end the bickering that has left the city with a fragmented , wasteful and inadequate mental health system . ? The chief victims are the chronically mentally ill , who shuttle helplessly from inadequate state hospitals to cold city streets . They seek refuge in depressing single-roomoccupancy hotels along upper Broadway , in the Bellevue Hospital area , the Bowery , and parts of Brooklyn . Some live in nursing homes , in doorways or on stone stoops . Yet the state has not evicted them from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the nation , is caught up in a mental health revolution  --  a revolution brought about by new drugs and the demand for civil rights for mental patients who were once locked and forgotten in state hospitals . With therapy , housing and vocational training , many chronic patients can now leave the hospital , work in a sheltered job and rejoin their old communities . But for former patients it 's a cruel freedom . Family and friends often turn away . Communities are hostile . , And New York City offers only a handful or supportive housing facilities and sheltered workplaces . What sort of freedom is it to live in a rundown hotel , to be victimized by other residents , often to be nothing better than a missing person until the next psychotic breakdown and the next visit to an understaffed state hospital ? Although many bemoan the fate of chronic patients , no one seems willing to take responsibility for their plight . The city blames the state for casting tens of thousands of patients onto the streets without providing money for their care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shift enough of its resources to them . The Federal Government offers no leadership . Last year Washington belatedly pulled together a meager $3.5 million for experiments in serving chronic patients in local communities . Governor Carey 's plan to finance a variety of services for former patients begins an effort to do more . The city , though eager for the money , is angry at not having been consulted . The state now wants to enlist the city 's advice but insists on the final word about where the money goes . It is time to plan together . A sharing of responsibility is needed along a much broader front . Dr. Alvin Mesnikoff , the state 's mental hygiene director for the city , would assign responsibility for care in a given area of the city to all the mental facilities in that area rather than leave it divided between feuding city and state bureaucracies with diffuse responsibilities . In some parts of the city the state would play the dominant role . In others , a city or voluntary hospital would dominate . Everywhere services would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the help and those who provide it . The plan would eliminate duplicate services and free funds for much-needed services . Some approach to joint planning deserves urgent consideration . Finger-pointing may occupy bureaucracies . But so far it has done nothing to improve the lot of the mentally ill.
