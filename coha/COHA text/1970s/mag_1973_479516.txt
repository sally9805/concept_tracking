ON JULY 14 , at the end of the European Championships in Bath , England , Boris Spassky came to dinner with me in London and afterward played chess against us . Of course it was quite ludicrous of us to take him on , like taking a swing at Muhammad All in a public bar . And to make our humiliation complete Spassky decided to lead with the chin . In one game he made a series of appalling moves , leaving his defenses wide open . We rushed into the attack only to be astoundingly checkmated with a short , sharp blow . Spassky then demonstrated how we should have played the situation , how with a little foresight we could easily have beaten him . In another game he began by moving his king straight into the middle of the board , which is chess madness , and within a few moves we had chances to checkmate him . At first these were difficult problems , three-or four-move combinations , and every time we missed them Spassky moved a piece hack and showed us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task easier and easier until finally we got it and we had mated the ex-world champion . Everyone 's eyes lit up , ours with a sort of perverse triumph , his with the simple pleasure of having made us happy . It was a relaxed , self-confident Spassky , very different from the one I met in Reykjavik last year just after he had suffered one of the most publicized defeats in the history of sport . Then there was the same humor and modesty , the same gentlemanly , old-fashioned politeness , but there was also a frightening degree of stress and worry . His head was so full of the match that he kept losing his train of thought . For days after his final resignation on the morning of September 1 the match had dominated his thoughts and dreams . " Two of the mistakes I made were the sort which would not be made by a fifth-class player , " he told me . " It 's been like playing a movie through backward . Why did I play P-B3 in game fourteen ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve speed , pain , and exertion , and are over in two hours , but chess is slow and the world championship lasted two months . There was nothing physical to divert or numb the players ' worrying brains . In such a situation psychology becomes very important . Spassky told me , " In a match like this one , chess skill is probably less than half the battle . The main element is nervous energy . " Anyone who has played chess seriously knows how the mind can be almost paralyzed by a strenuous five-hour session , but I had always imagined that in the end skill must triumph . Not always so , apparently . A blow to your opponent 's ego , on or off the board , can be more valuable than a pawn . Nicholas , Lord Bethel ' , is a dramatist , trans lator , book reviewer , and poker player . At first it seemed that Fischer must lose this off-the-hoard battle . Surely his tantrums would affect his game . Spassky was already in Reykjavik , seemingly cool , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yet again missed a flight from New York , he said , " I think he is lying in his bath gazing at the ceiling and thinking of me here waiting for him . " He did not realize that these displays , far from exhaust . ing the American , were building him up toward a peak of creative sensitivity . In the end it was Spassky 's game that suffered . When Fischer failed to appear at the opening ceremony , Spassky was faced with a terrible decision : should he play the match at all ? " I would have been fully within my rights to leave Iceland , and if I had done this all chess players would have understood me . I could have gone home and remained champion . " The Soviet chess authorities with their decades of supremacy must have been tempted by the idea of retaining the title so easily , if only by a technicality . Spassky was aware of such feelings . They influenced and confused him . So already Fischer had an advantage . Spassky could retain the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet his challenger . Chess is usually a gentle game , but here was this wild American behaving so erratically and with such rudeness that the match was going to become a shows that during 1970-71 his results deteriorated . The world champion also has administrative work . He is an ex officio member of the World Chess Federation 's " central committee . " Spassky found this work boring and suspects that Fischer will find it intolerable . " I was tormented by all the duties and responsibilities . Now I can just play . That 's another reason why I 'm in a better position than Bobby . Being champion occupies part of your time and part of your mind . If we play again the position will be the reverse of 1972 . He 'll have had three years of troubles and have had three years of chess . " There is also the unknown factor of Fischer 's mental state . Unlike Spassky , Fischer has an obsession with chess which excludes most of the joys and good things of life . He had a consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to make bins happy . But now that the speeches are over and the match has vanished from the newspapers , Fischer finds he has nothing more to achieve . Money-making , for instance , was something that seemed to interest him , and last autumn he may have thought that here was some new , exciting thing he could do well , some new way of winning . But he is not world champion of the money game and his efforts to make millions , successful at first , have ended badly . He is not used to such failure and seems confused about how he should exploit his position . Spassky says , " I said this a long time ago , that Bobby was going to be a very unhappy man . He has terrible problems . He is afraid of people , he thinks they 're trying to get at him . And he has this need to be admired and worshiped . All this , with the normal after-thematch depression and the problem of being champion , makes a strong cocktail . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously for a year and from what I hear it 'll he some time before he 's able to pull himself together . Meanwhile he 's like a laid-up ship gathering barnacles . " Spassky himself has had a better year since he returned to a cool reception and an uncertain future . He has now analyzed the Reykjavik games in detail as well as the psychological situation . and is fairly confident he can beat Fischer if they play again . But he remembers ruefully that he was " 100 percent sure " he would beat him in Iceland . One problem is the age difference between them . Ten years ago a player was reckoned to reach his peak about the age of forty-two . Since then the peak age has dropped steadily until , according to Spassky , it is about thirty-five or thirty-six . " That is a statistical fact , " lie says . The trouble is that he was thirty-six in January , while Fischer has seven more years before he begins to worry about decline . And however much he explains his defeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply the weaker player . I T WAS A DEPRESS/NC WINTER for Spassky . He was upset at not being able to play in San Antonio and Majorca . They thought I was tired , that I might play badly . Maybe that 's right , but I 'm not afraid of playing badly . I was bound to after a match like that . I just wanted to keep playing . That 's what a chess player has to do . " He played at a tournament in Tallin , Estonia , and finished third . It was not very impressive . At last in June he was allowed to go abroad and play in Dortmund , West Germany . I saw him there and asked him about the chances of a quick return match with Fischer . Now he excludes any chance of a replay before the next world championship at the end of 1975 . He says , " Our chess authorities in Russia are against it . And they 're right . In the first place to play Fischer I would have to be showing top results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happy with the quality of my game . I 'll just have to play it out of my system . The other thing is that I know that my best chance of beating Fischer is by going through the qualifying rounds like the other challengers . There 'll be eight of us , and of course I may not win , but if I do I 'll have the right impetus and morale . To beat a world champion you have to be in the right spirit . You have to be sure inside yourself that you 've beaten all the others and that now is the time to knock the eagle off his perch . " Spassky has several more tournaments before this struggle begins with the quarterfinals in January . In the late spring the four winners will have their semifinals , and in the fall there will be the final which will deA POISONED RUSSIAN KING cide who has the right to play Fischer for the world title a year later . In July Spassky told me , " The Spassky shares are going up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been like a steam engine with a hole in the boiler . I 've been making steam all right , but it 's all been leaking out , it has n't been getting me anywhere . Now I really think I 'm on the mend . I have to be able to turn that steam into energy . " So , in spite of his exhaustion and disappointments , Spassky is again setting out on the killing championship track . If he does well it will mean two unimaginable years , one year of cutthroat games against the seven " eagles , " who are mainly Russian , and another of preparation for the great revenge . Such a meeting could be the most exciting in chess history , though there are many " ifs " in the way of it , not the least being the problem of how to bring the champion up to scratch . Recently a figure of $1 million was mentioned to Fischer as the sort of sum that might be offered in 1975 . " Why not $10 million ? " was Fischer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like a snake which has swallowed a rabbit . He is lying on a warm stone having a long sleep . " He says again , as an afterthought , " I am the rabbit . " He calls Fischer " my dear cannibal , " almost affectionately , as if he liked the thought of being swallowed by such a genius . What really cheers him , though , is the thought that maybe Fischer swallowed him only at the cost of poisoning himself . Every chess player knows the beauty of giving one 's opponent a piece in order to obtain a checkmate a few moves later . He may hope that his defeat in Reykjavik will turn out to be the most imaginative sacrifice of his career , that he managed to turn himself into a " poisoned king , " which Fischer took only at the cost of destroying his chances at the next meeting . Spassky lost the Battle of Iceland , but the war continues , and the longer Fischer remains a recluse , the better chance Spassky has of beating him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ruthless contemplation . He said to me , " If we play , the result will depend on how we both feel when we sit down for the first game . I 'll look across the board at him and then I 'll know , before I move my first pawn . "
