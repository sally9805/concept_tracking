txt LINES OF BATTLE are being formed in Washington and across the nation in the wake of last week 's agreement in principle between American and Panamanian negotiators on a new treaty under which the United States will relinquish control of the Panama Canal by the year 2000 . The administration of President Carter has launched a major sales campaign to gather support in the Senate and House for the new agreement . But administration officials admit they have n't got the Senate votes necessary for ratification so far . And in the House , which must pass enabling legislation for any payments to Panama required by the treaty , opposition to the new pact is growing . Author David McCullough spent more than five years researching his book , ' The Path Between the Seas , ' which traces the planning and construction of the Panama Canal from its inception in France by Ferdinand de Lesseps through the canal 's opening in 1914 . In a recent inter view McCullough said Americans will have to ask themselves some hard questions before the U.S. should decide to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an edited transcript of the interview : Q  --  The construction of the Panama Canal is one of the great technological achievements of the century . Considering that Britain lost control of the Suez Canal at a relatively late date in Its imperial history , is tile U.S. appearing too eager to ride with an antleolonialist trend in agreeing to relinquish the canal by the year 2000 ? A  --  The Suez Canal was not built by Great Britain , but was purchased by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli from the Khedive of Egypt . The Panama Canal was built by the United States in a great national effort , coming at the dawn of the century , which was to be , we felt , our century . To relinquish the canal at this stage in our history , would have far more historic and psychological meaning than say , the relinquishment of Suez by the British . We would be giving up something that we created , that is a part of our industrial capacity , our technical genius , and our boundless confidence at that time . Q  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the canal Is not defensible , and that sabotage would be easy . Has it ever been defensible ? A  --  The canal has never been defensible . If the defense of the canal had been at issue back In 1903 , we 'd have never // Q. &; A. Canal vital to U.S. image ' // , , 1 ' built it It 's always been possible to de  --  stroy those locks , either by shelling them from the sea or by bombing . So that is n't really an argument . 1 . Q  --  What about arguments that the Ca ' nal is no longer that important to ocean : commerce ? A  --  Many contend the waterway is obsolete , therefore by giving it away , ? you 're not giving away very much . The contention that it 's an antique comes , from the fact that there are some 700 ; ships at sea that because of their size ? can not use the waterway . But those , ships were hot meant to go through the ; canal . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and for I them the canal works perfectly . Q  --  Oue government view is that the canal and the treaty governing It constitutes an " Intrusion " of the sovereignty of Panama . Should we not relinquish icontrol , do we remain " colonialists " in a Western Hemisphere state ? A  --  I think history will show that one does n't really absolve the sins of one 's grandfathers by making a great benefaction to someone . By the same token I do n't think you win friends everywhere by a gift , I do n't think that by giving the canal to Panama we are going to tecome beloved throughout Latin America . Nor do I think that by giving the I canal away we are going to erase the I " stain " of something done by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 . If we are going to follow the logic of history wo would n't give the canal to Duran ? we 'd give it to Colombia . It FA . was Colombia who was really wronged in 1903 , not Panama . Most Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the canal to our history as a people ? A  --  The canal is a very important part of our consciousness ? of what kind of continental entity that we are ? of what kind of people we are . I think also we have a great pride in the canal . A pride not only that we built it when that seemed Impossible , that we succeeded where the French had failed , that we remade the world  --  reducing distance , reducing the terrible punishing voyage of going around Cape Horn , conquering tropical disease , joining the oceans . So we 've been providing a great international service and doing it well . So why , therefore , give it up ? Why turn it over to Panama ? This is something I hear again and again in my travels . People say , " What possible good can we gain by giving that country our canal ? " Q  --  Does the United States really have any options other than giving up control of the waterway ? A  --  It does n't have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama . Why ca n't there be some international organization established to run the canal ? maybe under the auspices of the United Nations or some international corporation ? Why ca n't this whole discussion on the future of the waterway be opened up . Obviously , there is no simple answer . But the quesiton is , has the government considered such an alternative ?
