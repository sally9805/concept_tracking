 | To begin with , I 'd like to say that I 'm against the myth of Washington and the Cherry Tree . That tale , told to me as a child , had a moral which I took to be : " It 's not so bad to cut down the cherry tree as long as you do n't lie about it . " I accepted the premise once , but I have begun to wonder . I could argue that a lie is usually discovered . It can be admitted and corrected . The cherry tree is gone ; and too many of them have been cut down already . I 'm for the cherry tree . That is not to say I am for nature and against man . Man is nature , as we are at last beginning to realize . There is no dichotomy , although man has imagined one , and our civilization is full of this artificial split . The widespread assumption has been that man is here , in towns , cities and communities ; nature is out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is strong evidence that this artificial split between man and nature has been responsible not only for many of the physical , social and economic troubles of our time , but it has also resulted in great moral and spiritual distress . It is a strange and terrible paradox that we have penetrated more deeply into the universe , but at the same time we have become alienated from it . And this alienation from nature has caused us to transgress its laws , to misuse its gifts and ? like all alienation ? it has made us profoundly uneasy . But today there is a growing recognition of this tragic rupture , and the new sciences in the field of ecology and environment are making vital efforts to heal the breach . I am straying into fields that are not mine . I write simply as a concerned inhabitant of our world . I am not an ecologist , a naturalist , or a scientist of any kind . I missed my chance at science many years ago as an undergraduate at Smith College ? through no fault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did very badly . I liked geology , which took me into the Connecticut valley and showed me the great movements at work on the earth . But I hated physics and would have failed if I had n't been tutored by a high school teacher in the basement of the town library . Because of my various difficulties the first year or so , I was called in to speak to my class dean , who suggested kindly that it would be a good thing next term if I dropped some of my ambitious courses ( Greek , Russian History , Religion ) and took up Home Gardening . Home Gardening ! I was insulted . Who did she think I was ? A fat , middle-aged matron ? I refused . Now , many years later , I think I understand why I was angry about Home Gardening . There was nothing wrong with it in itself ; and now that I have reached the age of those gray-haired  | matrons , I could do with some gardening knowledge . But the garden seemed to me then too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , even the garden clubs have leaped over the garden walls and are out crusading in the countryside . What I wanted then was the wider environment ? and , a year after graduation , I found it . I married an aviator . My married life took me flying over the globe with him , exploring new air routes . The year I married , transcontinental passenger routes were just starting and transoceanic ones were a dream of the future . Hedgehopping in single-engine planes through the Rockies or across Canada and Alaska , and later flying over the Greenland ice cap and the South Atlantic , gave me a sense of the earth as a planet ; and , increasingly , a concern for the planet and the life on it . If the enclosed garden did not seem a valid unit to me in my college days , it seems far less so today . How can we b : concerned with our garden when impinging on it are wars , poverty , human anthills of cities , inequalities of opportunity in education and jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his resources ? In fact . we are so besieged by problems that we hardly know which crusade to join first . Should it be the antiwar movement ? Civil rights ? Urban blight ? Pollution and conservation ? Until just recently most people put conservation or environment last . The younger generation had some excuse . They had n't seen the world as it was 50 years ago . That is one of the few advantages we who are older have over today 's young people . We have seen a fresher world , and are perhaps more appalled by its scars and wounds . But despite this , I believe that environment is particularly a young people 's concern , because basically it is a struggle for life against death . And the life force is stronger in the young . I think it is especially strong in young women . Woman through the ages has been the conserver of life . She is always the first one to oppose wars , to fight waste , to struggle against disease . I have a strong feeling that much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ) ? the kind of passionate protest that was expressed in the antiwar moratorium ? results from more than revulsion against the war in Vietnam . terrible as that is . It is rather , I believe . a deep instinctive protest against the growing dehumanization of our world ? against an industrialized , mechanized civilization in which the flame of life itself is sputtering . What could better symbolize this threat to life than war ? Especially this war . It can be taken as a horrible example of our slow and paralyzing enmeshment in a technological . life-destroying civilization . The protest against war includes , I believe , a growing sense of impotence in face of a threat so large , vague and ominous that it is difficult to encompass or even give  | a name to : a dying environment that is encroaching on us like a lava flow . When the war ends , people are beginning to realize , this threat will still be there , and it will loom even more ominously than before . The nightmare of a dying environment includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with which we have been struggling . The " plunder of our planet " ? to quote naturalist Fairfield Osborn 's early warning ? has been going on for centuries . It is not peculiarly Western but it has been brought to an apex in the highly scientific and industrial civilization of the West . Some people claim that the impetus for plunder is built into our religious heritage , from the time God told Adam and Eve they should have dominion over " every living thing that moveth upon the earth . " But whether or not the Bible is responsible , Western man has certainly followed this Old Testament command to the letter . He has considered himself the lord of the universe , many notches above the lower animals , with all other life subservient to his needs and pleasures . Not all societies have been based on such an ethic . Most primitive cultures have had a reverence for the life-giving earth and a sense of humility before it . The American Indian had an entirely different feeling for our land . One of their chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and all people should have equal rights in it . " Land was not even considered personal property be- by the Indian . It was a precious legacy still to be shared with others and to be more handed down to future generations . The primitive had a natural instinctive unity with earth and its life . But even more sophisticated societies in the , trug- East have had an ethic that preached reverence for the earth and all life . In quote Hinduism , divinity pervades all things : warn- mountains , rivers , flowers , stones , plants , insects . The Buddhist vow dedicates the t has believer to the salvation of all living highly creatures . The sense of unity with ion of nature is vividly shown in Zen Bud- dhist paintings and poetry : " An old pine tree preaches wisdom . And a wild bird is crying out truth . " We can thank the hippies for intuitively pointing the way back to naturebased religions . But it takes more than an isolated ethic to stop a lava flow . The vision of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important step in a new approach to nature , but it is not in itself enough to save an environment . Isolated vision , unless implemented by action , is just another form of home gardening . The Buddhist vow did not prevent the bare , denuded hills in China . The Hindu sense of a life-pervading divinity has not saved the eroded earth of India . And while Henry Thoreau was reading ? and living ? the book of nature at Walden Pond , the virgin forests farther west were being slashed through like weeds . The tendency to implement vision with action is a Western ? and particularly an American virtue . On the whole , when we see something wrong , we want to fix it ? immediately . A good trait , if you have enough vision . Unfortunately , in the past , we have too often lacked long-range vision . We used our gift of action to destroy rather than preserve our environment . Today , as we look at the ugliness , waste and decay that surrounds us , we are quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or finger-pointing @# @#  | is not much more effective than home gardening . We are all in the leaky boat together ? or in the spaceship ? with dwindling supplies . We have no time or strength to lose on gestures of remorse or recrimination . It would be far more constructive to recall some men of action in our history who fought against the prevailing trend . The ideas of such naturalists as Thoreau and George Perkins Marsh , for example , eventually bore fruit , and under Theodore Roosevelt , the national forests were established . At the same time , John Muir , an impassioned defender of wilderness , started the Sierra Club to carry on his work . With Stephen Mather , the National Park System ? one of the earliest and still one of the best in the world ? was begun . We owe a debt of gratitude to these early conservationists . But their efforts and their early successes were only first steps , hardly more than signposts in the right direction . At this point , as a modern conservationist has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too passive a word , and it is far too limited . It is not enough to save the cherry trees or the redwoods . Their salvation is necessary but only part of the picture . Conservation is not enough because the destruction of our planet has reached a point where we are all threatened by the crowded conditions we face , by the water we drink , by the air we breathe and the food we eat . Because of our immense and terrible capacity to spread our civilization ? our tankers spilling oil ; our pesticides pouring into the oceans ; our explosives carried thousands of miles by air ? there is no area of the globe left untouched . The most remote corner is vulnerable . Eskimos in the Arctic have radioactivity in their bodies , and penguins in the Antarctic have DDT in their fat . Nothing less than the total environment must be protected . What are the basic elements in our environment necessary for human life ? Earth , air , water , animals and plants . Our instinct to preserve these is not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . Disturb any one of them and man 's life is altered ? sometimes fatally . Take earth , for example , that proverbial " mother that never dies . " Unfortunately , in our time , we have come to discover that earth ? for all practical purposes ? can die . We have eroded it with strip-mining , deforestation , and overproduction . Today our land area is also shrinking by being entombed , paved over by cities and suburbs and eightlane highways . The east coast will soon be one huge megalopolis from Boston to Washington . Someone has suggested we just call it all " Bos-Wash . " Water ? We 're accustomed to think of our supply ? from rain , rivers , lakes and oceans ? as inexhaustible . Yet our growing population and our luxury standards have increased our need for more water ? to turn dynamos , cool power plants , irrigate deserts , carry sewage and fill bathtubs . At the same time , our waters ? and our vast coastlines ? are becoming steadily more polluted by run-offs from fertilizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being poisoned . Birds are dying from eating toxic fish and sprayed insects . We have started a house-that-Jack-built chain reaction . A modern version of the nursery rhyme , printed in an English magazine under a cartoon of a dead dog , put it bluntly : " This is the dog that bit the cat , that killed the rat , that ate the malt , that came from the grain that Jack sprayed . " There is still the sky ? what Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called , " The sweet and scarless sky . " It is no longer sweet and it is being scarred every day ? every hour . The air is fouled by smog from incinerators and factories , fumes from automobiles and gas trails from jets . Air pollution is engulfing each one of us . At the root of our problems and intensifying all of them is our soaring population . The incontestable statistics are there for everyone to read . World population now stands at three and a half billion people . At the present rate of growth it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . By the time today 's young people are grandparents , the world may have seven billion souls . In spite of gains in food production and experimental developments in farming the sea , the present rate of population growth can only lead to eventual global famine ? on a scale never known before . In North America we have a little more time ? not much , but a little . We are big and still rich and have more resources . We also use up our resources faster and waste more . What we are about to lose is not life but the quality of life . It is vanishing even now : space , privacy , silence , solitude , beauty , diversity and , to a large degree , freedom . The outlook is dark but doom need not be inevitable . We are not impotent in the face of this crisis . We can still reverse the trend to disaster . There is already a great swing of public interest toward environmental problems . Over the past few months , conservation and environment have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherhood . Ecology is the new fad ? one I hope will last . In my college days , the fad was drinking goldfish ? not conserving them . Modern young people are more intelligent . Or are they just cautious ? Today those fish are probably full of DDT . At the moment , everyone wants to save the environment . The courageous steps taken by former Secretary of the Interior Udall and former Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare Gardner , both of whom served under President . Johnson , have been followed by President Nixon 's nationwide fight against pollution , and the important announcement by HEW Secretary Robert Finch that three departments in the government ? Health , Agriculture and Interior ? have agreed to " phase out " the use of DDT . Outside of the government , there are hundreds of active conservation groups working in different areas ? from the World Wildlife Fund to local groups of concerned citizens across the country . This is a field in which personal initiative carries weight and every individual counts . Environmental quality is everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is their future world they are saving and their qualities we need : energy , courage and openness to change . For , despite the recent enthusiasm for conservation , the fight has just begun and its implications are barely grasped . It will take a revolution to reverse the present trends . Technology is not going to cure itself . ( The so-called cures are often more disastrous than the complaints ! ) Mass production , advertising and commerce will not willingly put on the brakes . Science can only inform us about our world . It can bring us knowledge but it can not set up values . Values are created by individuals . In the present crisis this means reforming society . The kind of reform needed will cut across city and country , across national boundaries , political ideologies and economic classes . Color and race are meaningless in this movement because it is dealing with basic humanity and its needs . It should protect all segments of the population and it is going to affect all segments . We will not be able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any convenient group of villains . The individual will be faced with choices and will have to pay the price for decisions in daily life . You may have to choose between some miracle detergent in your washing machine and the extinction of fish in your streams . If you care more about a manicured suburban lawn on which you have used poisonous pesticides , you  | may have to do without robins . It comes down to what each of us values most . To save the earth will take a revolution in values , a new ethic by which people think and act in terms of guardianship of the planet and its life . Such an ethic runs counter to a lot of sacred American beliefs : rugged individualism ( which too often means each man out for himself ) ; limitless growth ; progress measured by size , wealth , efficiency ? all cherished values of a materialistic society . A revolutionary change in values does not usually come about without great suffering , and it often comes with the shock of simplicity . I once talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a landowner , a gentleman-farmer . He came back from the war determined to rebuild agriculture , which he felt was the strength of France . He showed me around his model farm and compared the smaller diversified farms of France with the huge specialized and mechanized farms of America . " Of course , " he admitted , smiling , " it 's much more efficient your way , but then , " ? he hesitated , almost apologetically ? " you see , our way , it makes a better man . " I am not saying that we must give up specialized and mechanized farming ; but whatever we do , we should consider his measure : What makes a better man ? What will happen to us if we continue to accept an increasingly inhuman @# world ? Will we cease to be human ? We have a new awareness today of what it means to be human , perhaps because " human-ness " is threatened . I had a sense of this human essence as I watched the first moon walk last summer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor in Armstrong 's breathtaking , cautious first step off the ladder ; nor in the slow , methodical motions of those two men , muffled and padded in space suits , as they set up equipment . It came to me the moment when , having gained their " moon legs , " they began to leap , to bounce lightly over the surface of the moon like balloons , in an expansive moment of play ? unnecessary play ( even though programmed into the schedule of work ) . In those few instants I felt , with relief , what it was to be human . It is to have something left over beyond the sheer necessity to survive . Play , joy , spontaneity ? these are the wellsprings of creativity . They may be extras but they are among the most marvelous attributes of man . We can not abandon them and still be fully human . A return to human values is essential . But is there something even more basic than human values ? I think there is ; something that might be called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values , it may be that earth and its preservation stand as great solid mountains ? primal values in which we can root ourselves . But to acquire these values we must expand our vision and see the earth , as the astronauts saw it and as the ecologists have begun to see it : in its totality . This new awareness of earth values ? the interrelatedness of man and life on earth ? comes close to being a new religious sense or a new expression of age-old religions . It embodies reverence for the miracle of life itself ? all life -- not just man 's . It encompasses love , care , and responsibility for other life , which is brotherhood . It upholds faith in a creative power greater than ourselves and in a creative universe we can be a part of . In fact , we are already a part of it , whether or not we realize it . We forget , because most of the time we are so insulated from nature in our mechanized world , what a great affirmative force pulses through our veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? that life force of nature ? ready to help us , waiting to be used if we join with it instead of fighting it . It is constantly at work healing the wounds of the world , covering war trenches with grass , clothing rubble with vines , throwing a spider 's web over a bare volcanic island , scattering maple seeds in empty lots , filling up every crack and cranny with life . When we ally ourselves with a force like this , not only can we renew our earth , we renew ourselves . The great life current runs through us , too , and we ourselves are made hopeful , affirmative and creative .
