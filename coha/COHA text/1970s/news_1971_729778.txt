txt For thousands of corporate bureaucrats , deep in the annual job of planning next year 's budgets for their companies , November is proving the cruelest month . For many of them , the deadline for submitting the budget to their company 's directors is only days away , but as yet they can only guess what rules for ' 1972 's game will be laid down by the government 's Phase 2 regulators . Although the Pay Board on Mqnday announced a 5.5%ayear limit on new wage and benefit increases , it 's still unclear who determines how to value the benefits , what exceptions will be allowed and , most important , whether the wage increases can be passed on to the consumer in higher prices . " We 've tried about everything from Ouija boards to chicken entrails to figure out what they 're going to do in Washington , and we 're still not sure , " comments one harassed corporate comptroller . The time urgency is severe because most companies are on a calendar-year basis and start their budget work in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval in mid-November or early December . " Even with the freeze and uncertainties we have to make the best estimates we can , " says Thomas Phillips , president and chief executive officer of Raytheon Co. , Lexington , Mass . " Otherwise , we 'd enter the year without any kind of a plan . Even if it 's an imperfect measuring stick , we need some kind of measuring stick . " The Situation at Chrysler Some companies , such as Citizens Financial Corp. , a Cleveland financial holding company , that normally would have a " pretty firm budget " by Nov. 15 , have put off their final deadlines until " early December . " Others , such as San Francisco 's American Building Maintenance Industries , are adopting a tentative budget and informing department heads to be prepared to adjust their departmental budgets later in the year , depending on what news comes out of Washington . - One man who is feeling plenty of pressure is Roger Helder , vice president and comptroller of Chrysler Corp. , which has annual sales of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right- now , " he says flatly . Although Chrysler 's deadline for submission of budgets from its various departments is Nov. 15 , Mr. Helder sees no way that all of the auto maker 's uncertainty about what 's to happen with costs and prices can be cleared up by that date . Before all the auto companies can firm up their pricing plans and submit proposals to the price commission , two things have to happen : First , the Pay Board has to rule on coming wage increases in existing auto contracts , which range from 6% to 61h% and are supposed to occur in late November or early December . Then , the Price Commission has to issue guidelines or some other form of hint on allowable price increases . Neither has happened . As a result , Mr. Helder has given Chrysler 's department heads a number of " pricing assumptions " so they can go ahead and prepare tentative budgets . One is for a 3% price increase , another is for less than that and a third is higher . Although Mr. Helder wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing triple work because of the several submissions on various pricing assumptions . A Delay in Spending One effect of the uncertainty , according to Mr. Helder , may be to delay some of the company 's spending that would have occurred early-in 1972 . It might be put off until later in the year because the planning process has been stalled . Right now , because the Aug. 15 freeze blocked Chrysler and the other auto makers from raising prices on 1972 models that officially went on sale in September , Chrysler is operating under an emergency " austerity program . " This program will continue until the price freeze ends . Some projects have been canceled , others deferred . Mr. Helder indicates the operating pressure caused by this holddown program is intense . He says Chrysler can defer some things , but only for so long . He mentions moves into new facilities . And he cites the impact of workers who quit but are n't being replaced because of a hiring freeze . At the moment , he says " only specific hardship cases " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packer that has diversified into many other businesses in recent years , finds itself in somewhat the same boat as Chrysler . Donald P. Kelly , vice president of finance , says the " many uncertainties " of Phase 2 " bothered us the most " in formulating Swift 's fiscal 1972 budget . One worry , he says , is whether Phase 2 will permit increases in labor costs to be transmitted into higher allowable prices . Also , he comments , " many of our raw material prices are floating free , " and " while that has n't caused problems yet , it could . " At PPG Industries Inc. the big Pittsburghbased glass , paint and chemical concern , the uncertainties of 1971 are making budget-making more of a " guessing game " this year , ' according to Robert Mitchel , assistant vice president-finande . But there have been no changes in departmental deadlines ( mid-November ) or procedures . " You just have to make certain assumptions , " says Mr. Mitchel . For instance , PPG has told its divisions that for budgeting purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through 1972 . Not only is that a guess , says Mr. Mitchel , but " there is serious question how much impact " the surcharge will have on imports of products like PPG makes , even it it does last all year . PPG 's glass business stands to benefit from the surcharge , But Mr. Mitchel is rather skeptical that foreign slags makers , who have estab- lished customers in the U.S. they 'll be reluctant to abandon , will quit shipping glass here . He thinks they 'd ship even at no profit if they figure the surcharge is a temporary measure . Making assumptions , of course , is the key to preparing a budget : otherwise the job of peering one , two or five years into the future would be so laden with question marks it would be impossible . The standard procedure for many companies is to have its own economists prepare a forecast for the general economy for the corning year . This is sent to department and division heads , who , in turn , use this forecast as a basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assumptions made for the U.S. economy by many of the companies checked by The Wall Street Journal indicate surprising optimism about 1972 . " We had some very serious questions in our mind , " says Mr. Mitchel of PPG , but the company 's own private forecast distributed to its corporate department heads in August  --  before the new Nixon game plan was announced  --  predicted . " continuing expansion of the economy . " " The election looming in November next year made it a good bet that the Republican administration would take steps to assure a strong growth economy , " Mr. Mitchel explains . " A damned good year , " was the similar finding of General Telephone &; Electronics Corp . economists , who are expecting a 9% growth in the nation 's gross national product in 1972 and 5% to 6% of " real growth , " discounting inflationary effects . At General Telephone , the budgeting process began on Sept. 7 when John J. Douglas , executive vice president for finance , mailed out a 6-page " economic outlook " memo to officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' most a certainty that the ( Nixon ) program will break the inflationary spiral , " the memo said . In an interview this week , top GTE officers indicated they still stand with the memo 's assessments . The GTE memo also forecast a decline in interest rates for the remainder of 1971 , but it warned that rates might rise again in 1972 as price indexes begin to rise again when freeze effects wear off . Interest rates are important to General Telephone , which has a short-term debt averaging $1.1 billion most of the time " A 1% shift in interest means $11 million to us , " comments Mr. Douglas . " Do n't play games " is the one commandment Leslie H. Warner , president and chief executise , says he gives officers of GTE subsidiaries . " We do n't want people submitting bigger-than-necessary budgets because they expect them to be cut , and we do n't want them underestimating earnings , so they 'll look better later in the year . We do n't want any surprises , " he says . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concrete , " Mr. Warner concedes there is a period of " interplay " between corporate headquarters and the various units . But even after that changes are made . " We keep these budgets under constant review , " Mr. Warner adds . " In March , we 'll take a close look based on Phase 2 , then we 'll take another close look in September . We do n't just set a budget for the year and leave it . We refine it as we go along , particularly in view of interest rates . " Another optimistic company is Evans Products Co. , a diversified Portland , Ore. , company in the forest products , building materials and railroad car business . Evans is " looking for a good economy " in 1972 based on company-projected housing starts of two million for the year and a market for 500,000 mobile homes . In making their budget , Evans officials decided to assume there would n't be a continuing freeze on labor and prices . " We 're projecting continuing wage increases , " says Luke Wygal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume we 'll be allowed to increase prices sufficient to all these increased wages . " Hercules Inc. , the big Wilmington , Del. , chemical concern , says it is n't having many budget difficulties because it likewise has simply elected to ignore the uncertainties of Phase 2 . " We are constructing our budgets as if there had been no 90-day wage-price freeze and no Phase 2 program , " asserts Ray Clark , treasurer . " There are too many uncertainties to do otherwise . " Hercules ' budget system and the industry it is in help explain this approach . The company puts heavy emphasis on three-year forecasts , which are due for submission to the executive committee this month . With a threeyear basis , Mr. Clark explains , " we might get a hold-down on some raw-material costs for a year or so , but over a three-year period , everything will probably average out . " Also , in the chemical industry many selling prices are still below the May 1970 federal basing point for the freeze . This gives chemical companies considerable leeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it proves necessary later . One of the most optimistic companies about 1972 is Dr Pepper Co. , the Dallas soft-drink manufacturer . In its budget it has included proposed wage rises it may not be permitted to give its employes ; it has excluded from the proposed budget a 5% price increase on syrup that it has already requested from the federal regulators . Even under these conditions it expects a 20% earnings gain in 1972 , according to W. E. Tully , vice president , secretary and treasurer . Dr Pepper 's three major cost items are raw materials , advertising and promotion , and payroll , in that order . Mr. Tully says year after year advertising and promotion get the biggest increases . - This provides some flexibility , he says . " Say we set up a $15 million to $18 million advertising budget , " he says . " We 'll commit some and heold back some in reserve . This reserve can then be trimmed if sales volume is n't meeting our projections . " Dr Pepper currently is forecasting a 12% sales rise next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic outlook for 1972 , " the more I read , the more confused I get . " Eaton Corp. , a large Cleveland diversified manufacturer with 100 divisions , is right " on target " in its budget work and thinks a lot of the worry over regulatory uncertainties is needless . J. Robert Killpack , vice president-finance , says that every year ' " we generally have some item that 's up in the air . A year ago we had to determine when the General Motors strike was going to end . If you look for an excuse to put off your budget program , you always could . " One development that has eased some of the budgeting headaches resulting from last-minute wage , *price and other changes is the use of computers by many companies . It used to take several accountants a week or two to calculate the impact of such changes for International Utilities Corp. , a widely diversified industrial and shipping concern , says James , assistant comptroller in charge of planning . " Now it 's a fairly simple matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readout of how a change will affect everything from payments on short-term debt to earnings per share of the holding company . If we tried to do this kind of thing with 1950s technology ? oh my God , " Mr. exclaims . Sprague Electric Co. , North Adams , Mass. , is another company that is n't too concerned with the federal government 's impact on its budget . For one thing , electrical-industry prices are 10% to 25% below what they were in tha base period of 1970 , so there is plenty of room for upward movement before they bump into federal ceilings . On wages , too , Sprague anticipates few problems ; its major contract covering hourly workers is a year old and has two years to go . And on salaried workers , Sprague held up all increases until July 1 , 1971 , just before the freeze , and then granted many postponed increases . " It almost looks as if we knew what we were doing , " sale Neal Welch , chairman . But probably the most fortunate executive of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , the Pittsburgh pickle packer . Heinz ' next fiscal year begins May 1 , 1972 . The company will start work on the budget about Feb. 1 and finish it around the last week of March . " There 'll be a much better picture by then , " Mr. Gookin says hopefully .
