THE GREAT REPUBLIC by BERNARD BAILYN , DAVID BRION DAVIS , DAVID HERBERT DONALD , JOHN L. THOMAS , ROBERT H. WIEBE and GORDON S. WOOD 1,319 pages . Little , Brown . $20 . <P> <P> A CONCISE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC by SAMUEL ELIOT MORISON , HENRY STEELE COMMAGER and WILLIAM E. LEUCHTENBURG 851 pages . Oxford University Press . $25 . <P> <P> In 1930 the late Samuel Eliot Morison and fellow Historian Henry Steele Commager published their first version of The Growth of the American Republic . The book swiftly became the standard by which competing histories were measured . Now , just as an abridged and updated version of the Morison-Commager classic appears , there comes a new contender : The Great Republic , written by six scholars-five of them winners of Pulitzer or Bancroft prizes . Their work is handsomely amplified with hundreds of black-and-white and duotone photographs , paintings and detailed maps , and interspersed with pictorial essays in sumptuous color . <P> The prose is another matter . Each author has hewed strictly to the period assigned him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is disappointingly uneven . In part two ( 1760-1820 ) , Gordon S. Wood discusses the celebrated 1801 Cane Ridge revival , a bizarre religious event in Kentucky where , according to contemporary accounts , thousands fell into frenzied ecstasies . Wood captures none of its manic exuberance . In part three ( 1820-1860 ) , David Brion Davis by contrast manages to make the often opaque character of Ralph Waldo Emerson both fascinating and comprehensible . Davis , who won his Pulitzer for The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture , also offers a splendid essay on the Mormon experience as a paradigm of American dissent : a people at odds with society while yearning to be part of it . <P> John L. Thomas , who writes of the decades from 1890 to 1920 , offers a series of trenchant analyses . His aphorism about the first World War is typical : " Both sides , driven by contrasting but strangely complementary illusions , had succeeded in proving that in total war it is the war that wins . " <P> High Color . Throughout much of its length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. scientist , who observed in 1800 that " the universal roar is , Commerce ! Commerce ! at all events , Commerce ! " Ideology may have impelled many Americans , but for most , it seems , it was the purse that had its reasons . Though John Cabot had scouted the shores of North America as early as 1497 , the English hardly deigned to look at their discovery until after 1551 when the wool market in Antwerp fell apart . The first plantations were get-rich-quick schemes , the colonists left to fend for themselves if they did not produce a quick return on investment . Occasionally , as the book amply illustrates , the greed was enlivened by some remarkable characters , like the 18th century Governor of New York , Lord Cornbury , a flaming transvestite who prowled his fort in women 's finery .
