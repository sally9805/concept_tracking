It was the most dramatic week in Chicago since the 1968 Democratic Convention . More than that , it also may have been a turning point in political history : the beginning of the end of May or Richard Daley 's fiefdom , the last great political machine in America . <P> A jury in U.S. district court convicted Alderman Thomas Keane , 69 , the machine 's second most powerful mem ber , on 17 counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy in secret land deals . <P> Next day another federal jury convicted Alderman Paul Wigoda , 52 , a machine member and Keane 's law partner , on charges of evading income taxes in 1969 on a $50,000 bribe from real estate developers for pushing a zoning change through the city council . The day after that , still another federal jury convicted Daley 's former press secretary , Earl Bush , 59 , of eleven counts of mail fraud . <P> The triple play was set up by Republican U.S. Attorney James R. ( " Big Jim " ) Thompson , 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerner , Cook County Clerk Edward Barrett and five other alder men . But " this time , " said Thompson , " the system was on trial . " Daley , 72 , who had a mild stroke last May , is considering running for a sixth term next year . <P> Whether he does or not , Chicago politics will never be the same again .
