THERE WAS A TIME when a woman Customarily had a baby after one year of marriage ; now she has a book after one year of divorce . Ever since Betty Friedan rode through the night to arouse the sleeping citizenry , the battle has been waged across the printed page . Militants , conscripts , and male camp followers have thronged the highways , waving their manuscripts aloft . One group , alone , has been silent . It 's the group who answered the question " Whatever happened to Margaret ? " with " She got married . " These middle-aged , middle-class princesses - slumbered on through the din of revolution in comatose righteousness . It had nothing to do with them . They reigned over their households by divine right , the divinity issuing from their-femininity and above all , their Motherhood . Every obeisance was due them by their mates : fidelity , support , sympathy , and obedience . In a natural state , death removes the unnecessary ; aged trees and aged tribesmen are allowed to die . Comedians in the Forties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All girls over fifty ought to be shot . " Nobody shot them . They did n't die . So they are here , but at the same time , they are extinct . And now the revolution has scooped them up into its storm . They find pressed into their trembling hands a declaration of independence they neither sought nor understand . Like slaves who were free to starve after Emancipation , they are free to be alone . Is there life after marriage ? They think not . They are the accidental victims of that ironic by-product of women 's liberation ? men 's liberation . It is not totally astonishing to find that some husbands , even those grown old in the traces , are interested and finally captivated by the women 's freedom cry , " What about me ? " " What about me ? " is a slogan all can rally round , Freud 's slogan , replacing Love Thy Neighbor ? and many others that saw good service . " We shall overcome " already has an antique ring , but " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , the husband asks , is he doing all the work , and ordered about when he gets home to boot ? Why must he come home at all if he no longer wants to ? Chic lady writers ( he would note , to say that biology is destiny only for girls . The husband , reviewing his life , and skipping lightly across the history of the human race , might feel that biology had been destiny for boys too , and that for every woman driven out into the snow , there were twenty sitting snugly by their hearths , protected , provided for , and cherished , simply because they were females . He might mention that war was not his idea of fun , and that having to feed , clothe , and house a family of total dependents could be a burden . He might think that to say biology was destiny for everybody would be more to the point . These musings would constitute a prologue while the stage is being set for the drama , or farce ? human events that lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess and awakened prince are required to perform . Dramatis personae M R. AND MRS. : that is their definition . It is a long time since the children have gurgled over their bottles , played , fought , cried , made friends , consumed fifty tons of food , grown pimply , gone to college , made love , and left home . The house is neat and quiet . Their friends are the so-and-sos , and the so-and-sos , and the so-and-sos . Everybody conies in couples : it is like life on the Ark . Mr. goes to the office and works . Mrs. is a lovely person . She always comes through for her friends . If anyone is in the hospital , flowers are delivered on the dot . She is a specialist in bereavement . If there is trouble , she is there with advice and good counsel . She votes in every election , pays her alumnae dues , and collects for the Red Cross . She visits her mother in the nursing home every other week . At the same time , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a first-class cook . Although she appreciates the admiration of male friends , She never actually flirts . She feels that she is growing old gracefully ; her hair allowed to gray , but with a youthful cut . She is only very slightly overweight ; everything in moderation , everything in order . She is well satisfied with herself and her situation on the night that Mr. comes home remarkably late for dinner . Fresh flowers on the piano . " By the way , " she says , as they sit across from one another at the tastefully set , candlelit table , " I paid that parking ticket for you today , but how come you were parked on Second Avenue at 8:30 in the morning when you 'd left for Chicago the night before ? " The exchange that follows must adhere to strict rules ; there will be the compulsory figures , and then some free skating . The compulsory figures : MR. : ( After a pregnant pause ) I ca n't go on this way . I must tell you the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MR. : Muriel . MRS. : Muriel ? MR. : It was . . . only a friendship . And then . it got out of hand . MRS. : Do you mean you want to leave ? MR. : I 'm afraid . .. it has gone too far . I love her . I 'm sorry . MRS. : But you ca n't do this to me . MR. : Why not ? ( A modern flourish ) The Holocaust was a minor event compared to this . Mrs. never doubted that she owned Mr. He was her husband . Abruptly , it has become evident that all she had was a thirty-year lease . Mrs. is now placed upon the rack . No one can help her . There is no anaesthetic for what she must endure ; loss compounded by rejection , humiliation , jealousy , bitterness ; she will even lose her home , that citadel of her ego . She must undergo peine forte et dare , not necessarily bravely , and certainly not silently . She will cry . She will sob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " He loves somebody else . Not me . I am alone . " What does it mean to be alone ? She had never thought about it . Who is she if she 's not Mr. 's wife ? She 's like a seeing-eye dog with no one to lead . A funny thing has happened to Mrs. on her way to a serene old age ; the road has sprung apart and she mus ? fall into the abyss , bellow. ing in rage , howling in terror . The children , roused from their fascination with their own lives , will be given the news ; each , in turn , will be very shocked , very moved , and , finally , very bored . It takes time to become the parents of one 's parents , and this has been very sudden . Poor Mrs. ! Distraught , she sobs out her tale , so old , so new , to understanding friends . She observes the overwhelming solicitude bestowed on widows while she , so much more grieved , is shunned . She senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixture of pity and sadistic curiosity with which drivers , safe in their cars , slow down to look at a bleeding victim of an auto accident . Any friend and , in the end , any acquaintance , will pronounce and be heeded as though they were Moses . They are all Wise Ones ; the manicurist , the Ph.D. , second wife , militant single , young , old ? the land of the emotions is a true democracy . Although the advice is precisely contradictory , she follows it all . " Be nice . Do n't drive him out . " " Be firm . Tell him to give her up at once . or you 'll leave him . " " It will pass . " " You 're through . Once the worm is in the apple , there is nothing you can do . " " Get in there and light . Get a new hairdo . Be gay . Drink with him . " " Above all , do n't start drinking . " Mr. 's friends , meanwhile , are taking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . They find marital discord a very strenuous pastime , but they will deliver every one of their prescribed speeches , standing on the chalk lines ; every thrown dish , every embrace , will be on cue . They will act their parts with conviction , with vitality ? with panache , in fact . Mrs. 's part has a great deal of crying in it , and so she weeps her way through her disordered days . She cries when she wakes up and she cries when she goes to sleep . She cries when people are cruel , and when they are kind . She cries on the tennis court , she cries at the bank . She is nourished by self-pity ; she is her own deepest sympathizer. her problem is hope . When she wakes in the morning to find Mr. lying beside her , she thinks , no , it is n't true . When they are out to dinner , she looks across the room , and he is there . They are Mr. and Mrs. It ca n't be happening . Leaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still afloat . For a time , they seem quarantined within it . Mr. is now like a grand piano wedged in the doorway . Mrs. pulls , Muriel pushes , but he remains stuck . He can not go and he can not stay . He thinks he loves them both . L ovE BECOMES a household word , as ordinary as toast or overshoes . But it is such a poor , overworked , disheveled slop of a word that it actually hampers communication . When Mr. says , " I love Muriel , " he really has not said anything very specific , although he thinks he has . It is very hard for Mr. to explain to himself , much less to Mrs. , how lie feels . " I am suffocating . " he wants to say , but only repeats , " I am in love . " With no practice whatsoever , not even a few knee bends , Mr. is having to struggle with some very heavy objects : passion and guilt , regret and desire , the need to escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in what might be described as situation comedy , Mr. and Mrs. suddenly find themselves involved in grand opera . So what they say is often the opposite of what they feel . Thus Mr. , returning home to a soft and teary Mrs. ( dressed in her light green dressing gown ) feels a rush of tenderness toward her , and so he says , " For the love of Cod , stop feeling so damned sorry for yourself . " Thus Mrs. snarls , " Do n't touch me ! " when she means , of course . " Oh , please touch me . " After that every piece of garbage from their shared past will be exhumed , held up to the light . and admired as if it were a piece of fine crystal . They become adept at emotional archaeology . " Do you love him ? " a Wise One asks . The question is puzzling . " Do I love him ? He 's my husband , is n't he ? " Mrs. was on the verge of saying . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the beginning of her education . Beneath the domestic machine there lay , after all , a woman . She loves him . It is a pleasure of which the main ingredient is pain because she can not have him . So she throws her dinner plate at him . He does not recognize it as the valentine it is . When a caged monkey wants an object he can not reach , he throws something at it ; it is a primitive response . But Mr. adds it to the growing list of Mrs. 's faults . Mrs. is now in the same ridiculous situation as Mr. ? that of a middle-aged person in love . She experiences a surge of vanity , urged on by the fact that her competitor is a young woman , and abandons her customary at-home costume of slacks , an old shirt , and sneakers , buying clothes that are a bit too tight and too bright . Distracted to the point of lunacy , she , always so tidy , finds herself stirring her coffee with the screwdriver left on the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks atone , resumes smoking , leaves the lights on all night , puts her purse in the refrigerator and the milk on the hall table , lets her plants die , and loses her temper at the cleaning lady . She is , in sum , a nervous wreck . But she is awake . Being awake has one very serious obstacle : Muriel . It seems to her that Muriel 's presence has saturated their lives . It is like a balloon , pliant but obstructing , that grows and grows till Mr. and Mrs. can not get around it to be near each other . Muriel is there . Mrs. 's jealousy of Muriel becomes stronger than her desire for Mr. It is brilliant , glowing , a perfection of a kind , almost joy . It is the underside of love . Mrs. and Muriel , at this moment , are so absorbed in pinpointing each other 's flaws , so enthused about each other 's failures , that Mr. sometimes feels that if he should sneak away neither would notice . Muriel accepts Mrs. 's hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hated Muriel would have been rude and unkind . Muriel is momentarily taken aback at being called a whore , but then she does tend to think of herself as a sort of Circe , a nice Circe . Seated in a cocktail bar with a firm grip on the hand of her battered , crumpled , and irresolute lover , she talks to him about pain , and is given to saying that life is painful , but after all , one must live . Muriel has a romantic turn of mind , which is a stroke of good fortune , for there is nothing so helpful to anyone who must be cruel as to take a romantic view of it . In fact , her philosophical leanings increase in almost direct ratio to Mr. 's ardor . With victory at hand , she is adopting a tragic approach to life , whereas Mrs. , toughened by defeat , is sometimes capable of seeing it as comedy . Mrs. , indeed , is changing , and not necessarily for the better . She now cooks like a hashslinger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though she had been educated not at Wellesley , but in the waterfront bars of Singapore . She is using words she never knew she knew . Her deportment confirms Mr. in his suspicion that she is basically a very aggressive and unfeminine woman . Muriel , when she met Mr. , cooked like a hashslinger , never made the bed , and used strong language ; it was part of her charm . But , succumbing to romance , she shyly begins to bake cookies , buy ties and monogrammed hankies for Mr. , and produce very gracious candlelit dinners . Although their lives are circumscribed by secrecy , it is tacitly understood that she would be a lovely hostess . Plants and flowers make their appearance in her apartment , and the bed is always neatly made . Muriel is caught up in a paradoxical situation . Having persuaded Mr. that marriage is stultifying , an obsolete institution , she finds that she very much wants to be married to him . Having discoursed , quite brilliantly , on the development of The Home into a monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much wants a home , with Mr. securely in it . Having uttered enticingly racy comments on the subject of fidelity , she insists that Mr. be faithful . And , having pointed out the preposterousness of Mrs. 's expecting to be supported financially , it has occurred to her that her tiny income hardly justifies her working from nine till five ( after they are married ) , and when Mr. 's tax bracket is taken into consideration , it would actually save money to stay home . It is a paradox but not a problem . Confrontation EFORE MLRIEL AND MRS , disengage from one another , there are two more compulsory figures to he performed . The first , and simplest is The Letters . Mrs. must write Muriel three letters . Letter A calls her a whore . Letter B says , " I implore you . " Much later , the less than eager Muriel opens Letter C. It informs her that Mr. is going to ruin under her auspices , and if she really cared about him she would give him up . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Muriel 's apartment , groomed as though she were going to meet a lover . Muriel is caught like a trapped rat , with the apartment a mess and her hair unwashed . Each is initially felled by the shock of finding the other to he a real , flesh-and-blood woman . Mrs. is pleasantly surprised to note that Muriel is , to tell the truth . fat . Muriel finds Mrs. unexpectedly attractive for her age , but marred by a poisonously upright personality . Earth , looking at the other , pities Mr. The exchange is not a conversation ; it is a ritual . MRS. : Do n't you realize you are ruining his life ? MURIEL : Ile does n't seem to think so . MRS. : Do you really think he can be happy with you ? MURIEL : We can try . IRS. : If you would leave him alone , I know we would have a chance . MURIEL : Listen , he rings my doorbell . I do n't call him . MRS. : Does n't it bother you to be making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et cetera . MRS. : I would like to understand you . MURIEL : I found I loved him , that 's all . Very much . MRS. : What kind of a woman are you ? MURIEL : What kind of a woman are you ? MRS. : If you really cared for him , you would n't .. . MURIEL : If you really cared for him , he would n't . . As they part there is the faintest , most delicate glimmer of comradeship between them ; unspoken , it is gone almost before it is there . Mrs. is quite satisfied with the interview . She is sure that at least two of those beautiful teeth are capped . Her hair was n't even clean , and it is obvious that she is as hard as nails . Well , if that 's what he wants , thinks Mrs. , Cod help him . Muriel , on the other hand , is unnerved by the meeting . Guilt , held so well at hay , momentarily overtakes her . Mrs. 's well-groomed person brought with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that evening in anticipation of his usual cozy and romantic visit , he is in for another set scene . It is the **80;3100;TOOLONG routine . Mr. , on his way home , indulges in a brief fantasy of leaving his shoes on the bank of the river and starting a new life . When he appears , Mrs. continues on her doomed course . She simply can not wait to break the news that Muriel has two capped teeth , dirty hair , and a rotten character . Mr. , whose heart has already departed , while his body lingers on at home , acts like the gallant he is , and takes his stand at Muriel 's side . Her lovable imperfections , challenged , only endear her to him more . He and she together will face the intolerance of Society . Mrs. is turning out to be a slow learner . But , with Mr. acting as the professor , her education , nevertheless , is progressing . She gradually realizes that everything she is is the wrong way to be . For instance , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I care for you deeply , " that is wrong . She should have been the sort who says , " I love you , goddamn it . Come here . " If she liked living in the country , she should have liked living in the city . If she had been very involved with their children , she should have been Inure casual . If she had social ambitions , she should not have had . The rejected always asks , " But what have I done to make you change ? " The response ? never given ? is , of course , that the change comes first and the reasons later . But Mrs. is learning . She has been told that she did not care for Mr. as a person . only as a provider . Is that true ? It may be a little bit true . She has been told that she is self-righteous , so convinced of her moral superiority that she is unable to recognize valid human emotion , or view human frailty with understanding and compassion . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas a suitable companion would have known that it is in constant flux . It is said that in the last minutes of a bullfight , just before the coup de grace , the bull learns . Dumb beast , slow-minded , he at last understands that , if he rushes at his tormentor , he will only be fooled again , hurt again . But it is too late . The knowledge , gained at too high a price , can not save him . Mr. has made , by now , more temporary departures than Richard the Lionhearted , who also , perhaps , understood that it took more courage to stay than to go . Property having been the cement of their marriage , they begin to use the dislodged fragments as missiles . But disputing over property rather than character is a relief , and they go at it with gusto . Occasionally , there will be a short truce . The silver ( hers ) and the crystal ( his ) bring back to memory dinner parties , the flushed and animated conversation across their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips to stand unnoticed on a shelf are filled again with meaning . How long they had been together ! " More than a quarter of a century , " Mr. remarks , and he , too ; grows teary . By the time the property is sorted , they have hacked their past to pieces ; it is unrecognizable . Drafts of separation agreements , lists , promises , and forfeitures -- paper . Mrs. strikes back as hard as she can on the alimony ( always protesting that it is not really like her ) . There is so much lie will not give her , but he must give her money . The demand is the narrow outlet through which all of her frustrations pass . Mr. is resentful , but does not tell himself why . " I want to take care of her , " he tells his lawyer , meeting , at that moment , with his own complete approval . It is only because of the practical impossibility of it that he cuts her demand down by a third . The compulsory figures performed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet with tears , departs for the last time . T HAS TAKEN A YEAR , but it is done . He is gone . She is alone . Mrs. looks at the door , the point of all of his departures and returns . Now it is closed forever . She sees her reflection in the hall mirror , that reflection that is now her sole companion . " He 's gone , " she tells it dully . There is nothing to look forward to . The days and the nights , formless , merge into each other . She does not wash , eat , or answer the telephone . Sometimes she sleeps and sometimes she does n't , and there is not much difference . A friend informs her that she is in a depression . It is time for the visit to the psychiatrist . With the promise of guaranteed sympathy . andthe shame at having to pay for it , she spends the first $300 for the privilege of crying in his presence . The Kleenex is ready at the edge of his desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want ? " She answers : " Him . " That is the wrong answer . Much later , she will be able to give the right answer in the form of that triumphant question " What about me ? " It is a question for which . all told , she has paid dearly . Recovering , Mrs. has the aspect of a patient with severe brain damage : the simplest acts and functions must be learned from the beginning . She writes on a pad : Everything is changed . She is the single person in the double bed . In the market check-out line , her few pitiable purchases advertise her ostracism , set her off from the wanted women with their bulging baskets of groceries . She feels ; as she walks through her neighborhood , that she is wearing a sandwich board proclaiming , " THIS WOMAN WAS REJECTED . " The telephone will ring , and she must repeat , " Mr. does not live here anymore . " How do you say it and sound happy , she wonders . Should she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jabbing little games her situation plays on her . Well-meaning friends do not know that the word we is taboo ; it stabs . She has found that it is a long way from I to we and a longer way back again . " Just put one foot in front of the other , " a veteran advises . " That is the way to start walking . " Doctors . Doctors are men who pay attention to you . She goes to all kinds of doctors . She gets her teeth done . It 's expensive and it hurts , but it 's attention . She has that mole removed . There is still the psychiatrist , with whom she feels like a rag doll being urged to march forth with the metallic purpose of a mechanical majorette . What About Me . Me . Me . Me . She takes tennis lessons . " You 're so lucky to have the time , " a harassed young mother gushes . It makes Mrs. smile . Slowly , how slowly , irony is replacing self-pity . Her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankly , I never did understand what you were doing with your life . Marriage is not an occupation . It is a personal arrangement . Now you 're free to be you . " ( Yes , but who am I ? ) Her older son ( by phone ) makes repairs on the shattered nest . " We 're coming for Thanksgiving . We thought we 'd stay through the week , if you 'll have us . The baby ? . " Her younger son is , of course , in Katmandu . He writes on a lovely postcard , in pencil , " Love is everywhere and indivisible . be home in March . " Starting over IT BY BIT , the void is filling in . Gratefully , she takes the advice of her older son ( who is two years younger than Muriel ) and calls the organization for which she had worked as a volunteer . A shade too heartily , she announces that she is simply drowning in free time and needs some work . They stingily dole out a few menial tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having received the ultimate rejection , Mrs. is not concerned about the little ones . She persists and soon is going to the office every day . The house is again neat and quiet . She is drinking too much , but why not ? She has no obligations to anybody but herself . The last tears are shed when she meets Mr. at the lawyer 's office to sign the divorce papers . She feels like a refugee , a stateless person . It is her first experience of official aloneness . Mr. Her husband . She has carted the suit he is wearing to the cleaners dozens of times . How much she misses him . A no as big as her whole life wells up in her . Why does he not feel the same way ? And ? I am different , I am different , she wants to tell him . Might lie not suddenly stand up saying , " Let 's forget all this nonsense and go home " ? No , his cold look tells her , it is not going to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , a short ceremony , the marriage vows in reverse ? Her hand shakes so that she does not know how she will write her name on the hated line . Then , through her tears , she notices that he has put the sideboard back on his list . She crosses it out , dries her eyes , and signs . Everyone tells her that she was very dignified . There is one more thing left to do . She must stop wearing her wedding ring . But the ring has become part of her anatomy . She can hardly remember a time when it was not there . She can not help thinking back to the moment , so long ago , so different , when it was put on by Mr. , whose own hand was shaking then . She has a picture , radiant in its clarity and detail , of the two of them standing sweating in their finery , ceremonial lust , youth . . . . My Cod , how she approved of him ! She pulls at the ring , but time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her finger . The final proof , she remarks to the absent Mr. , that biology is not destiny . The next day she goes to the jeweler who clips the ring in two . Looking at the severed pieces in her hand , she shrugs . At last she has learned to shrug ! It is the answer to the question she has asked herself so often : how do you accept the unacceptable ? Mrs. clips out the announcement of Mr. 's marriage to Muriel . It is a very small announcement . Muriel has quit her job , dedicating herself to decorating their new apartment , cooking , sending flowers to people in the hospital , and giving advice and good counsel to her troubled friends . She buys cleverly at sales . Mr. works a little harder under the burden of supporting two households . But each night he is eager to return to his new wife , new home : he expands with a sensation of freedom ? in fancy if not in fact . He has unburdened himself of the past , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is tonic and talisman to hold at bay the frightening shadows . As he had proclaimed , " I am in love , " he now proclaims , " I am happy . " Mr. believes he can keep his emotions under control by labeling them . When the alimony check is late , Mrs. is filled with wrath . But , she , the renovated Mrs. , is finally able to ask the prone princess , what , exactly , is he paying me for ? On no fixed day , Mrs. is aware that she is suffused with a large inner smile . Of course , lacking sensuality , it is not a celebration . There is an absence of tamhourines and castanets . She is at peace with her bitter freedom , and more . It is as though she were standing up straight for the first time . She understands that she was always leaning , so that , when Mr. moved away from her side , she fell . She knows , too , that she will fall again ? and get up again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the pleasure is profound . Sharing balmed , but also diminished , experience . There is an intensity to this that could become addictive . Whatever she does , there will always be the deep pride of the survivor . Yet there is a stubborn circularity to human behavior . So when a man , some other woman 's restless husband , hovers on the boundary of her senses , she begins , helplessly , to envision at once candlelit dinners , shared property , and all the other delights of conjugality . But this time she views these soft imaginings with skepticism . Mrs. , having achieved the shrug , may even go on and learn to wink.
