txt Former President Richard M. Nixon has all but admitted a central role in the Watergate cover-up by acting more like a defense lawyer for his later-convicted top aides than as the nation 's chief law-enforcement officer , While unable to bring himself to admit committing either an impeachable offense or an Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . obstruction of justice , he conceded to television interviewer David Frost , in an interview broadcast May 4 , that " a reasonable person " could call his conduct a cover-up . " I will admit , " Mr. Nixon said near the end of the nationally televised 90-minute interview " that during that period the spring of 1973 rather than acting primarily in my role as the chief law-enforcement officer in the United States ... that I did not meet that responsibility .

" He added : " I did n't intend it to cover up . " In an emotional outpouring in the interview 's closing moments , the resigned president voiced his deep distress to the American people over the Watergate episode . " I let down my friends . I let down the country . I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government , but think it 's all too corrupt and the rest , " he declared . " Yep , I ... I , I let the American people down , and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life . My political life is over . I will ... never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position . " He adds , plaintively , " maybe I can give a little advice from time to time .

The nation 's only resigned president , who had kept ? a secluded silence on the scandal ever since it drove him from office nearly three years ago , appeared to be plunged into intense emotional experience by the Watergate questions . It was more a case , it seemed , of Mr. Nixon confronting himself than of Mr. Frost confronting Mr. Nixon .

" . . . And then it snowballed , " the interviewer suggested . " It snowballed , " Mr. Nixon conceded . " And it was my fault . I 'm not blaming anybody else . " The former chief executive , whom a House of Representatives committee voted to impeach shortly before his resignation , volun-teered : " I have impeached myself . . . by resigning . That was a voluntary impeachment . " Mr. Nixon disclosed that he had " seriously considered " resigning in late April , 1974 , more than three months before he did so , after compelling his two top aides to resign . He told speechwriter Ray Price to announce the president 's resignation in the speech he planned to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resign , ' I said , ' put that in too , because I feel responsible ' " ) , but decided to stay in office partly because of foreign-policy initiatives then under way in China , the Soviet Union , Vietnam , and the Middle East . Effect on trials ? What will be the impact of the Nixon admissions and comments on Watergate ? In the quick aftermath of the interview there are only questions : . Will his words taint any of the trials of those Watergate-related defendants whose cases are still in process , such as the appeals of Messrs . Mitchell , Ehrlichman , and Haldeman ? Will the American public accept the Nixon rationale for his deportment ? Will this be the beginning for him of a move back into some kind of respected role in society ? as he says he hopes will happen ? Or will this merely trigger further Water- gate controversy , with new tapes being disclosed and with new accusations being lodged against the former president ? Was-this , indeed , a clearing of the air , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public to be once again immersed in Watergate ? Reason amplified The former president gave a broader reason for his eventual resignation that he did when announcing it in August , 1974 , on the narrow grounds that he lacked " a strong enough political base in the Congress " to ward off impeach. ment . " Even if I 'd won the Senate impeachment trial by a vote or two , I would have been crippled and ... for six months the country could n't afford having the president in the dock in the United States Senate . . . " Two tearful sessions are recalled by Mr. Nixon as his presidency collapsed about him  --  the only two times he . wept , he said , " since Eisenhower died . " The first took place on an ironically cloudless , tulip-filled spring morning at Camp David when he told Mr : Ehrlichman to resign . The other occurred just half an hour before Mr. Nixon went on television to announce his resignation .
