txt On the Sunday after the Pennsylvania , primary , AFL-CIO President George Meany told his political lieutenant , Alexander Harken , to start returning Jimmy . Carter 's phone calls . " Mr. Meany did n't have to ask the weatherman which way the wind was blowing , " joked a young labor official , paraphrasing the Bob Dylan song of the 1900s . Carter had been a wrong number to the terrible-tempered Barkan since the Georgian rallied Democratic governors against . " cigar smoking labor leaders " In a dispute over'the AFL-CIO 's effort to water down party ? reforms , according to party sources . BUT CARTER 'S drubblag of a labor favorite , Washington Sen. Henry M. Jackson , in the Pennsylvania ' primary delivered a karate chop to the AFL-CIO 's ? prestige and apparently showed Meany which direction the . hurricane was heading . Meany 's reaction underlines how labor and the Democratic establishment are accepting Carter 's nomination as almost an  --  accOmplished fact and beginning  --  reluctantly in many , cases  --  to wrap themselves around his blue-knit figure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom Meany had not had a frlendly'chat . BUT NOW THAT the crusty labor leader " is in " to Carter , the ' odd couple has talked on the phone and arranged to meet , at an AFL-CIO headquarters across the green park from the White House for a discussion of mutual pluses and minuses . Meany has called a meeting of the AFL-CIO executive council for May 19 and the question , according ' to Many labor aides , will be not " if " Meany will endorse Carter , but " when . " None of the labor officials believe Meany will break his policy of neutrality until after both party conventions this summer . Some think he will give an indication May 19 to let the AFL-CIO understand Carter is acceptable . Some union officials are understood to be encouraging Moony to make a gesture of sympathy to show , one said , that " the leadership is n't completely out of-step with all the rank and file that voted for Carter . " The UAW , not a member of the AFL-CIO. and whose leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated the move toward Carter Thursday . Eight of the top officials endorsed the Georgian in the Michigan primary . NOT EVERYBODY feels he 's acceptable , even if there is an apparent movement without direction . , John Lyons , president of the Ironworkers International , said tartly : " I certainly would not endorse him on the record he has now . He 's ambiguous and is on both sides of every issue . In Georgia his record with labor is not good . He 's only a press-made candidate . ... I have never talked to anyone in the labor movement who was really for Carter . " And a Meany aide said , " If the convention were tomorrow and Carter were nominated , there probably would be an endorsement , but it would be lukewarm . " IN A STRATEGY apart from the AFL-CIO , nine major unions  --  some of the most politically active in the country  --  formed the Labor Coalition . It has worked for Carter in some places and for other candidates elsewhere , with the aim of electing union delegates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions met last week , and while some would prefer someone else as the nominee ? Hubert H. Humphrey or Jackson , usually  --  none expressed hostility to Carter , according to one who was there . " They all seemed comfortable with him , although they want to talk to him about being specific on is. sues , " he said . THE NINE UNIONS are the Communications Workers of America ; the International Association of Machinists ; the American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employes ; the international Union of Electric , Radio , and Machine Workers ; the Oil , Chemical , and Atomic Workers ; the Graphic Arts Internstienal Union ; the United Auto Workers , and the NationalgEducation Association . But some anti-Carter labor and political operatives feel the coalition 's strategy backfired . They argue that while electing labor delegates , the coalition was responsible for helping Carter wrap it up quickly and it should have unified behind a prounion candidate like Jackson . " They the Coalition unions presidents wanted to be kingmakers , " a Democratic campaigner said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected they would have the keys to it . But it did n't work out that way , and they 're hanging their heads low , even if they are with a winner . " ONE LABOR official questioned how much help the AFL-CIO 's vaunted Committee on Political Education COPE was anyway , despite its computer lists of every union worker in the country , In Pennsylvania , a source said , Meany put in a help-Jackson S 0 S call to United Steelworkers President I. W. Abel , and the state AFL-CIO promised a get-outthe-vote drive . But Jackson wound up second in the popularity contest and a weak third in the delegate quest . COPE 's " reputation has outrun its ability to perform , " said one of the new wave of union officials . " It is n't a problem of money . The problem is an awful lot of show and no performance . It 's repeated in state after state after state . They just do n't know how to play the new politics . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
