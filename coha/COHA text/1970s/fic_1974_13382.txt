( The play begins . All twinkle lights twinkle up , as do playing area lights . The audio tape is turned off . The actors enter in extreme slow motion . They flirt with , seduce and try every available means to con the spectators . Gradually the audience members become aware of the actors who move toward them . They can only view the actors through the jail cells . Because of the physical setup , the audience has to work to see what is going on . As the actors enter their cells , the slow motion ends and each begins her opening monologue to con . Each actor speaks directly to various audience members trying to convince each one of her innocence . ) ( When Jockey begins to speak to the audience , twinkle lights on all cells remain on .

" It 's such a nice drive on a clear day . I get into town often lately . Some groups who 're interested in us ask for me to come and speak to them about how we 're doing here . And believe me , I 'm glad to talk about it . I 've come a long way since I got convinced I was my own worst enemy . I was doing hard time . I was so mean I spent forty-nine days in the " Adjustment Center . " I was n't about to change for nobody . But then it dawned on me that the more I stayed in a negative vibration state , the longer it would be till I could get back out into the free world . I just had to turn myself around and become the other side of the coin .

It was on the way to get my inspection sticker . Lucky it was my first offense or I 'd have up to six . Cute , eh ? Write your Congressman . I write every day . If you do n't have a record , they might even take you seriously . Try it . Costs a hell of a lot of dough to keep me here . I 'd rather be surf fishing in San Clemente !

Sometimes I get up in the morning , I want to take a walk . I might want to talk to someone . But they do n't let you talk to anyone until after one P M on Saturday . They got me trained to wake up at sixthirty A M. ( Laughs , sputters ) I used to go to bed at six-thirty A M ! They got me working in the sewing shop now , and I like it O K. But when I first came here they could n't understand me . They do n't realize that some of us out there , we do n't work . Not everybody has to do a nine-to-fiver for chump change , y'understand .

Like this babe we had in here . She set fire to her mattress because they would n't let her hold hands with the person she was sweet on . They sent her to California . Told her she 'd be happier there . Told her there were no girls here like the " way " she was , y'understand ? But there were five hundred of them in the prison in California and she would n't have to set fire to her mattress there .

When her arthritis got so bad she could n't make corsages and funeral sprays no more , she went back into waitressing at Dunkin ' Donuts . She worked all her life  --  like since they invented Social Security  --  you dig ? She kept all her forms and she wrote down all her numbers , you dig ? She was always up front with her numbers . So she retires two years ago . You know what the government gives her for working from the time she was ten years old  --  you know what they give her ? Seventy-eight dollars a month . Count ' em .

( The sound rises fully as all prisoners now join with Kathleen , speaking key phrases from their speeches . All lights twinkle until Miss Schnauzer , a prison official , appears at opposite end of the playing area . When the women see her , they fall silent and withdraw into their darkened cells . During Miss Schnauzer 's speech they change to prison dresses and tennis shoes . Over their dresses they wear identical green or blue hospital or prison gowns . Miss Schnauzer wears a gray and red guard coat . In the Omaha Magic Theatre production , when prisoners transformed to guards , they slipped into bright marching band uniform jackets . Miss Schnauzer unties the rope which has kept the audience confined to the lobby . She shakes some hands , welcoming them into the prison , and directs them to seats . She smiles to both sides of the audience , makes a gesture of welcome , stops , looks down at the floor . She 's not used to addressing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She straightens up , works to relax her body , her eyes showing inner disturbance . As she speaks she scans each audience member very closely . She is checking to see that no contraband matches , cigarettes , a sharp object , a belt is brought into the prison . Years of watching for the passing of contraband and/or the tapping of love messages on toes keep her from letting go of the " guard " mind set . She may be any age , but seems youthful and " with it .

I think some of you may have noticed the new sign just to the right of the front gate : " WOMEN 'S STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY . " The legislature was kind enough to vote us a new name this year and we were able to paint a new sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the dark ages of penology , there was a place where inmates were confined for punishment , which our charges referred to as " solitary confinement , " or euphemistically , as " the hole . " But since the **45;790;TOOLONG revolution has brought us into this new age of enlightenment  --  and thus more humane treatment geared toward rehabilitation  --  what used to be called " the hole " is now a gaily painted place where inmates who may be feeling upset may go to meditate  --  alone  --  away from the hubbub of correctional life . ( She crosses to area in front of cells as she speaks . By this time most of the changing activity has been completed  --  at least all uncovering that the audience should n't see . As she crosses , lights follow her . They go out as she passes out of the area . ) MISS SCHNAUZER As East has met West , we in the West have been wise enough at times , I hope , to gear up and make use of some of the applicable Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanity and calmness to some of our angrier ladies . ( Distant growls and bar rattling noise from the cell areas . Miss Schnauzer waits for it to end . She does not look at inmates but holds a smile on the audience. ) p. 7 MISS SCHNAUZER A few days of meditation and scientifically controlled fasting in " The Adjustment Center " helps a disturbed individual realize she 'd rather have the company of her new friends here as well as three square meals a day . Further , I 'd like to call your attention to the up-to-date plumbing . No woman has to flush a toilet herself . The flushing is controlled at the central guard station . This way one matron can supervise an entire cottage of girls , where it might have taken up to five before . This saves you , our employers and taxpayers , money in eliminated salaries . I 'm really happy you were able to come today , as tensions sometimes run high here and seeing faces from the free world , faces of those who know how to live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act as an inspiration to our girls . As I 'm sure you realize , by the time a girl is placed in here she 's reached rock bottom . We work hard with the girls to help build up their self images , to teach them a trade so they may one day take their places as useful members of society . You 'll hear various stories today . Please take most of them with a grain of salt . A lot of our girls have lived quite unreal lives and they do exaggerate their cases , and the reasons why they are here . But please understand me , we do show compassion for our girls , but not sympathy . You may feel at times that you want to show sympathy toward some of them , but let me caution you in advance : " sympathy is weakness . " They wo n't respect you for it . They 'll respect you if you respect them , but " sympathy is weakness , " and they 'll use every con game in the book to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming and showing an interest in what we 're trying to do . We do need more money for staff and better facilities and you can help us toward these with your vote . And now we 'll show you a composite picture of a day in the life of our facility . Please do n't feed the inmates or ask to eat with us . Our budget does n't cover you . ( Miss Schnauzer breaks into an enormous , toothy smile which freezes on her face . She rotates so that all the audience partakes of her good will . One prisoner comes out of her cell transformed to a Guard wearing a blue and red jacket . She marches toward Miss Schnauzer , who stands smiling and rotating . They perform a military " changing of the guard . " The new Guard lifts a violin to her shoulder and plays a dissonant chord to signify the prison bell .

In Omaha Magic Theatre 's production this was signified by hitting cell bars with a chain . The prisoners except Kathleen , who has been restricted come out of their cells , stretching and yawning . Guard moves to center playing area and mimes turning on showers . In O M T 's production the prisoners wore green surgical gowns as robes over their other costumes . As they wait for their showers , the Guard drags Kathleen from her cell and takes her to a shower way from the other women . During the following scene this Guard takes a great deal of interest in Kathleen 's shower . Periodically , Kathleen will catch the Guard in the act of looking her up and down .

Matron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance . She has been totally submerged in her action with Kathleen . El Toro immediately acts as if she is comforting Jockey , who immediately acts as if she 's ill . Champ acts normal , keeps showering as her cover . ) MATRON All right , keep it down  --  you 're turnin ' into prunes .
