txt SAUDI ARABIA and Jordan , the two moderate Arab states whose support is considered crucial to Middle East peace efforts , both sharply criticized the Camp David accords between Egypt-and Israel Tuesday for failing to recognize Palestinian rights . Both criticisms , contained in communiques issued after Cabinet sessions called in Amman , Jordan , and Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , came as Secretary of State Cyrus Vance prepared to leave for the two Middle Eastern capitals in an effort to win Jordanian and Saudi support for the accords . Observers emphasized that while the statements did not constitute outright rejections of the agreements , they clearly demonstrated the difficulty of Vance 's assignment . The sharper and more significant criticism came from Saudi Arabia , the oilrich bankroller of the Arab " confrontation " states whose petrodollars give R considerable influence over the policies of Egypt , Jordan , and Syria . " WE DO NOT consider that the results of Camp David guarantee a framework for peace , " said the Saudi communique issued in Riyadh after a Cabinet meeting chaired by King Khaled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw from the occupied Arab lands , nor ( mention of the right of the Palestinian ' people to self-determination in their own homeland .

" Alluding to Egypt , the Saudi statement said each Arab country has the " right to regain its lost territories .. . as long as these efforts do not contradict overall Arab interests .

Page 18 THE SAUDI statement followed a similar though more cautious communique by Jordan 's King Hussein , who said in Amman that he was not committed to abide by the " framework " for peace agreement reached at Camp David between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin . But Hussein , in a statement drafted at an emergency Cabinet meeting on the eve of Vance 's arrival in Amman , also did not rule out the possibility that Jordan might eventually join the negotiations . " Jordan has no legal or ethical commitment to the Camp David agreement , in which it took no part , " the statement said . Jordan " condemns separate peace agreements and also declares that the Palestinian people are the first and // From page one 2 Arab states rip accords // most important party in a peace settlement , " it said .

PLO leader Yasser Arafat was even less pleased . He vowed in a fiery speech that President Carter would pay for ' ' the dirty deal " reached at Camp David .
