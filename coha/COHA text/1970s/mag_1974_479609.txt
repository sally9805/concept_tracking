Er 0 SAY THAT VINCENT DE ROULET was the I worst Ambassador in the annals of American diplomacy is perhaps to overstate the matter ( he was , after all , responsible for no invasions or civil insurrections ) , but to say that he was an unreliable amateur seems to me a fair - ; omment on a record that needs only a few words of introduction . Although he had been he American Ambassador in Jamaica from 1969 to 1973 , few people had heard of him intil the occasion of his public disgrace . Declared persona non grata by the Jamaican gov:rnment in July 1973 , de Roulet was heard to lescribe the Prime Minister of that government as " an emotional Yo-Yo . " Few diplomats peak in such plain words , and so I was surrised that the American press gave only brief otice to de Roulet 's dismissal . No matter how areless their deportment or how profound their : upidity , American Ambassadors seldom get nt home , particularly from small and depenent countries in the so-called Third World . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w paragraphs on an inside page of the New ork Times . Preliminary inquiries among iends at the State Department suggested so range a chronicle of folly and embarrassment at I left immediately for Kingston . I was nazed to find that even in remote Jamaican Ilages- there were people who remembered Roulet 's name with derisive laughter . Still unwilling to believe what I had been d , I returned to New York to talk to de Rouhimself . He had been described to me as an ggressively arrogant " man who took pride in his " forthright and pithy " manner of address . He was said to be brooding in his apartment on Fifth Avenue , and , if my information was correct , I reasoned that he would be anxious to tell his side of the story , to rescue his reputation from what I was sure he would regard as the calumny of his social inferiors . In this I was not disappointed . De Roulet granted me two audiences , on one occasion allowing me to transcribe his remarks on a tape recorder . Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if assured that one day the injustice done to him by lesser men would be understood in its proper light . Well over six feet , de Roulet spoke with an impetuous haste that I learned to recognize as consistent with his idea of himself as a man of action . The following narrative relies largely on de Roulet 's own recollection of the events that led to his expulsion from Jamaica . The more implausible episodes in the narrative I subsequently verified I. and sometimes amplified ) by talking to correspondents in Jamaica and officials in the State Department . I have tried to present the Ambassador 's point of view , and I do not mean to detract from what he considers to be his considerable accomplishment . I first met him at the Links Club on East Sixty-second Street in New York , where Early American prints and ancient wooden globes gave the room an air of civilized gentility . The Ambassador began by recalling the feeling of ennui that afflicted him in the summer of 1968 . " I had grown sick of sitting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to do something about it ? to serve my country . " Noblesse oblige ALTHOUGH WILLING TO CONSIDER any form of government service , de Roulet felt that he ould be most useful as an Ambassador . At the age of forty-two he was a rich man , unashamedly proud of his race horses , his yacht , his clubs , his inherited wealth . He sometimes boasted that he had been b6rn into money , and that his wife ? " a Whitney , you know " ? belonged to one of the richest families in the country . He believed in the idea of what he called " a certain noblesse oblige in us . " De Roulet was a political conservative and would , no doubt , have contributed generously to Richard Nixon 's Presidential campaign regardless of his ambitions . But , having made the decision to invest in the campaign , he thought seriously about exploring the opportunities available to him in a Nixon administration . For the first time in his life he sat down to write his curriculum vitae . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is the owner of Towne-011er &; Associates , a " big , little company " that provides marketing information to the manufacturers of health and beauty aids . This company in turn owns the Patrina Corporation , which is engaged in the business of breeding and racing horses ? seven or eight horses at a time . De Roulet 's passion for horse racing had led him into his major appearance in public service as a member of the New York State Racing Commission . He also listed his services as trustee of the prestigious Buckley School and as director of a Long Island bank ; but his principal work had been in the field of medicine , or , as he put it , " I think I 've been chairman of every standing committee of all the hospitals in Long Island City . " Finally , he listed his various clubs : New York Yacht Club , Links Club , Links Golf Club , Turf and Field Club , Jockey Club , Twenty-Nine Club , Deepdale , and the Madison Square Garden Club . Having decided on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get an appointment appropriate for a man of his background and experience . " I wanted to deal with the right guy , " he said . " I did n't want to go through seventeen committees and all this , that , and the other thing . " One option open to him was to inquire of H. R. Haldeman . De Roulet 's father had introduced Haldeman 's parents to each other , and the two boys had grown up together in Los Angeles , but for the task at hand he sought out another old California friend ? a Republican fund raiser who set up a meeting for de Roulet with Maurice Stans . De Roulet resented the suggestion that he sought to purchase an Ambassadorship . " They 've never proved any Ambassadorships were for sale . In fact , Stans specifically told me at our first meeting that Ambassadorships are not for sale at any price . " In any event , after the meeting , de Roulet said he spoke to his wife and then decided to contribute $50,000 to the 1968 campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another $25.000 , and shortly after the election he was appointed United States Ambassador to Jamaica. * ' N OCTOBER 1969 DE ROULET arrived at Kings-ton aboard his ninety-foot yacht , Patrina . Together with a stable of race horses that he intended to run at the Cayman track , he brought with him his amateur 's conviction that many foreign-service officers were n't up to the challenge of true diplomacy . Within a few weeks of his arrival he developed a new respect for the complexity of his mission . " Everybody thinks of Jamaica as an island in the sun where you drink rum and copulate with octoroons , " he said , " but I can tell you it 's rough as hell . I jumped to my gun all the time . I even carried a gun in my lap when we drove through Kingston . " Whether or not the Ambassador needed lc resort to such extreme precautions , the country had in fact become unusually troubled sine ( achieving independence from Great Britain it 1962 . These troubles are rarely seen by the 300,000 American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opulent tourist en claves along the coasts , they are isolated fron the island 's problems . But , as the Jamaicans de scribe it , there 's a " rich man in his castle , poo . man at his gate " quality to the country 's life for outside of the affluent tourist enclaves then , is true poverty . The unemployment rate is abou 25 percent , and the crime rate is extremely high In recent years , the crime problem has bees exacerbated by the growth of the trade in ganj ? a powerful Jamaican marijuana that Ame icans often exchange for guns . Some of the mar disturbing features of the times are the ocu sional shoot-outs between the police and arm in Kingston and the assassination of leadin businessmen . Underlying all of these problem are a growing racial antagonism and an ant colonial rebellion against U.S. economic co trol of Jamaica 's two major industries : bauxil and tourism . The Ambassador 's apprehensions also we aroused by his first inspection of the Kingstc embassy . Not only was the building in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaicans er ployed by the embassy did not rise when I approached . He considered this an affront his office , and thenceforth he required them stand whenever he passed by . Recalling I impressions at our conversations in the Lin Club in New York , de Roulet thought it obvio why the embassy had been allowed to fall in such dispirited condition . " You have to reme * All told , de Roulet and his wife contribut $175,000 to the two Nixon campaigns . De Roulf mother-in-law , Mrs. Joan Whitney Payson , was also major contributor-16113,000 to the two Nixon ca paigns , as well as $83,000 to Republican Congressi ( al candidates . ber , " he explained , " that until I arrived , Kingston used to be the repository of the dregs of the Foreign Service . " The new Ambassador was impatient with the traditional approaches to diplomacy , and he refused to be restrained by the rules of protocol . At times he even transformed the embassy 's official business into a kind of comic opera . Every now and then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his " help , " put on " playlets " with each one instructed to act out the role of a Jamaican political leader . He also had them draw a cartoon of the animal each felt he most closely resembled , and then had stamps made in those shapes so that they could be used to sign memos and mark correspondence in animal code : de Roulet became a rabbit ; the deputy chief of mission , a pussycat ; the CIA man , an elephant . Outside of the embassy , the new Ambassador quickly demonstrated a talent for offending the sensibilities of his host country . In his conversations with me he spoke of the Jamaicans as " the most spoiled race of people in the world , " as " idiots , " and as people suffering from a " rampant inferiority complex . " During his tenure as Ambassador his public characterizations were even less flattering . He casually referred to Jamaicans as " children , " and in Time magazine he was reported to have called them " niggers . " He apparently did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he think it impolitic to remark , as he frequently did , that Jamaica offered less for the tourist dollar than any other resort with which he was familiar . When his dog was lost he placed an ad in the paper offering a $500 reward ? far more than many Jamaicans earn in a year . He loved his dog and did n't understand why the news-papers wrote mocking articles , nor why some Jamaicans criticized him for valuing dogs more than people . Shock treatment A L OF THESE SLIGHTS were minor , however , when compared to the fury that he stirred up over the question of visas . For two decades Jamaicans have been leaving their country for the United States . As de Roulet describes it , Jamaicans view a U.S. visa as " a passport to utopia , to a euphoriant utopia . " Today there are an estimated 500,000 Jamaicans living in the U.S. , compared to 2 million in Jamaica itself . The problem from the standpoint of the United States is that only a fraction of the applicants can be legally admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand visas a year . Jamaicans have traditionally circumvented this barrier by taking out tourist visas and staying on as illegal aliens in the 89 United States . To prevent these hack-door entries , the visa laws have been written to provide thirty-one different reasons for turning an applicant down . The result is that a screening official can , if he chooses , deny any application . Ambassadors traditionally avoid direct contact with visa applications , but to the consternation of his State Department supervisors , de Roulet became obsessed with visas . He was determined to halt the illegal immigration , and to accomplish this goal he decided that it was necessary to use a kind of shock treatment . Jamaicans are " like women , " he explained to me . " They 're independent until they need something , and then all of a sudden they 're not . " His visa policies soon created a bitter political controversy throughout Jamaica . He was accused of making the application process so exhausting and humiliating that Jamaicans would be discouraged from even applying . Under previous Ambassadors the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embassy on a given day . But de Roulet limited the number of applicants to 150 a day and made the screening process far more exacting . As a result , applicants had to queue up well before dawn to get a space in the line . Fearful of being rejected if they did n't look prosperous , they came dressed in their Sunday best and stood throughout the day wilting under the broiling sun . To add insult to injury he then closed off the embassy 's toilet facilities for the visa applicants , explaining publicly that the Jamaicans use too much toilet paper and it clogs the toilets . In an attempt to fully describe the daily scene at the visa line , de Roulet showed me one of his confidential State Department cables that he had written on the subject under the title " The Flesh Peddler . " After passing the confidential document to me , he suggested I read it out loud to him , which I did . It was a hot Monday morning . Summer in the Tropics had arrived and 1 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing full well that a long day and a long week lay ahead . I arrived at the Chancery shortly after nine and was greeted by a long line of human flesh , much resembling a funnel in shape . There are three apertures available at 43 Duke Street and the Non-Immigrant Visa line ( or cattle chute as it is better known ) . The front door was choked with people who wanted to go and live in our country , Watergate and other problems not withstanding . With eyes aimed straight ahead at the bowels of my business 1 made my way through the front entrance with people picking at my arms calling on me to help get them visas . In another cable , which he also showed me with considerable pride , de Roulet described the desperation of a group of applicants who had been waiting in line since 2:00 A.M. The Ambassador arrived at Chancery at 9:10 on July 14 as the police guard at the entrance of the visa section was announcing to the NIV applicants that there would be no more interviews for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into the on-coming mob with flailing fists . By sheer luck a riot was averted . IN TIME DE ROULET 'S POLICIES led to charges I that he was a racist ; one television interviewer finally asked him if he looked down on Jamaicans : " Well , when you 're six foot , four inches tall , " he said , " it 's hard to do anything else . " When criticized for his policies , he would counter with criticisms of his own . " I did n't throw out a lasso and draw in all the people who come there in country buses .... It 's a great national disgrace . Why do n't you find out why so many people stand in line every night of their lives ? " On the occasion when he showed me his cables to the State Department , de Roulet acknowleged his role in a drama I had previously heard described as " the Marine vendetta . " As in a number of the controversies involving de Roulet. accounts sometimes differ . The following is the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the embassy was detached from guard duty and put in charge of the " granny corps , " a collection of old ladies who were hired to clean the embassy at night . De Roulet wanted the embassy to be spotless , and complaints had been lodged that the granny corps was n't doing its job . An investigation revealed that the ladies were all religious zealots who spent most of their time praying . The sergeant failed in his attempts to reason with them , and so he resorted to a threat . He declared that he was the devil and said he would punish them if they did n't start working . Then he hid in the closet , where he filled his mouth with lighter fluid ; when they came into 111. room , he threw open the door and spat out the fluid through a lit match . The resulting flame . seemed to the granny corps to be fires of retri bution , and they fled the embassy . The nex day the embassy was filthy , and the well-inten tioned sergeant was put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having taken away their right to buy duty free liquor . ( They had been charged with sell ing the liquor to Jamaicans at a sizable profit . In any case , one of the sergeant 's buddies ap parently set out to right the wrong that he fel had been perpetrated on his friend . While a security duty that night , with a .38 on his hi and a billy club in hand , he entered the Arnbas. sador 's offices and began to search through the desk of de Raulet 's secretary . He was looking for security violations , and much to his delight found , he claimed , some classified documents . On behalf of his friend , he gleefully put the Ambassador 's secretary on report . The young Marine 's victory was short-lived . however , for while performing his security check he had found and eaten a stash of jelly beans that the secretary had stored in her desk . She retaliated by placing the sergeant on report for stealing her candies . Now it was the sergeant 's turn to avenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slipped into the Ambassador 's bathroom and relieved himself in the toilet . When the deed was discovered , the outraged Ambassador struck back by putting the sergeant on report yet again ? this time for defecating in the Ambassador 's commode without flushing . The sergeant 's honor was now at stake , and on his next security duty he returned to the scene of the defecation to seek tougher revenge . After much fruitless searching , he spotted a wooden box on de Roulet 's desk , and he carefully took out the screws and opened the box . Inside he found just what he had hoped for : several documents which , although not highly classified , had to be kept in a special safe . The triumphant sergeant put the Ambassador himself on report . that amount to $500 million . All that remained for the new guarantees to go through was for the new Ambassador to grant his approval ; it was considered a mere formality . De Roulet , however , surprised everyone by first refusing and then steadfastly resisting pressures to grant his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too great ; in his opinion the American aluminum companies had been irresponsible citizens in Jamaica , and he believed that nationalization or expropriation had become a distinct possibility . For six months , de Roulet held up the loan guarantees . Finally , he gave his approval but only after receiving assurances from OPIC that no more loan guarantees would be issued in Jamaica . The Ambassador did n't approve of the OPIC program ? but once the $500 million in loan guarantees had been issued , he considered it his responsibility to do whatever was necessary to protect the financial interests of his government . If that included disobeying the orders of his State Department supervisors , so be it . " There are certain things a freewheeling guy with lots of money can do , " he explained . " I do n't have to worry about being sent back to Washington to live in a split-level house in suburbia for the rest of my life . " What ensued was a campaign of unconventional diplomacy in which a Senate subcommittee later found that de Roulet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish the objective he had been specifically instructed not to pursue . He had begun by browbeating the chief executives of the American aluminum companies ? insisting that they see to it that their companies improve their public standing in Jamaica . These companies had come to Jamaica in the early 1950s ; they bought up thousands of acres of land . scattering thousands of farm families into the country 's overcrowded cities . The Jamaicans received little in return because the American firms succeeded in writing agreements that allowed them to pay minimal taxes despite the enormity of their investments . Further , the mining process , roughly the equivalent of strip mining , employs relatively few workers and devastates the landscape . De Roulet 's dealings with the aluminum-company executives were pursued in a curiously furtive fashion . Generally he only talked to them on his frequent visits to the United States and then only when he had taken precautions to make sure that his phone was untapped . Usu , ally he called from a pay phone on Madison Avenue near his New York apartment overlook . ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the aluminum companies had never direct ) involved themselves with their companies ' of fairs in Jamaica . But at de Roulet 's insistence these executives flew to Jamaica for at least ten meetings with the Jamaican government . As a result , the companies began to seriously support social programs in the country . Encouraged by this success , de Roulet began to extend his interventions into Jamaican politics . An election was coming up , and de Roulet set out to keep the question of nationalization of the American bauxite companies from being introduced into the campaign debate . He was n't worried about the incumbent Prime Minister , Hugh Shearer , for the two men were friends . Shearer was what de Roulet called a " realist " ? that is , a man willing to strike a deal . " In the whole time I dealt with him , " de Roulet said , " I never had to listen to a long speech about his little people with withering bellies and the back-to-Africa crap . He was a hard-boiled businessman . He knew where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , about Shearer 's rival in the election , Michael Manley . The danger with Manley , he explained , was that " he was much more of a socialist dedicated to an egalitarian society . " De Roulet felt it essential to the interests of the United States to keep Manley from taking office , and he devised what was later characterized as a " deal " to get Shearer reelected . The Ambassador 's scheme called first for getting Shearer an appointment with President Nixon . Ordinarily a President would not take the time to meet with the Jamaican Prime Minister , but de Roulet was being assisted in his efforts by his lifelong friend H. R. Haldeman . In the letter requesting an appointment , de Roulet pointed out that Shearer was not only violently anti-Communist but that he could be relied upon to maintain the integrity of American investments in Jamaica . This , the Ambassador observed , was important for a variety of reasons , " not the least of which is the fact that some of the President 's closest supporters have extensive real-estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President that Shearer was a well-dressed and courteous Negro ? not likely to say anything inflammatory or embarrassing , and potentially valuable in enhancing the President 's voting appeal with blacks . The appointment was granted . In addition to the Presidential meeting de Roulet also arranged to have a $20 million AID loan announced just before the election . As a further concession , he took Shearer to see Richard Helms , the director of the CIA . " I manipulated it , " he said . " Yes , I brought him right into the CIA building , " the Ambassador declared proudly . " It gave us a chance to talk about Cuba a hell of a lot , and it gave us a chance to get a hook into him . You know , it makes these guys a Big Thing in the Third World . " In exchange for these offerings de Roulet said that Shearer agreed not to raise the issue of nationalization in the campaign . " I think he got the general impression that the President of the United States in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bauxite boys were nice people to have as friends . " * T WAS A FEW MONTHS LATER , in the spring of 1 1971 , that de Roulet reached the zenith of his brief career in the Foreign Service . He had violated virtually every diplomatic taboo , but none of that seemed to matter . He was a success . Not a humdrum success , mind you , but a full-blown , officially certified success . The declaration was made by a team of career Foreign Service officers in a confalential inspection report which begins as follows : " Under the vigorous , skillful , and intelligent leadership of a non-career Chief of Mission , Embassy Kingston gets highest marks for its achievements with respect to U.S. objectives . " The inspectors commented that the Ambassador 's diplomatic style was unconventional , but , they concluded , " It works . " Also at about this time , President Nixon 's personal lawyer , Herbert Kahnbach , flew to Jamaica to attend Mrs. de Roulet 's birthday party . The Ambassador pledged Kalmbach $100,000 for the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Ambassadorial assignment in Europe . The next year , however , his candidate for Prime Minister unfortunately lost the election . Instead of Hugh Shearer , the Jamaican electorate chose Michael Manley , the son of one of Jamaica 's national heroes and himself a deeply popular and charismatic leader . The country 's poor embraced Manley as a kind of savior . Jamaicans often assign biblical names to their politicians . They called Manley Joshua and Shearer Pharaoh , and they would chant their approval when Manley told them he would take them out of Egypt to Jerusalem . Then he would hold up a cane that he called his " rod of correction " and say he would use it to sweep out the corruption of Pharaoh . This was not the kind of rhetoric that would comfort de Roulet , and I can imagine that on the day after Manley 's election he began to lose interest in Jamaica . He was suspicious of Manley , suspicious of him despite his polished manners and education at the London School of Economics . Among the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kinds of government officials found in postcolonial Africa . ? You know , " he said , " somebody once said that every one of those cute little countries always got a guy who was twenty-eight years old from the London School . of Economics as Finance Minister , and it 's so true . It 's s00000 true . " Whatever the reason for his despondency , de Roulet soon gave up his interventions in high affairs and resumed his fitful questioning of unworthy visa applicants . He began to use his authority to harass those applicants of whom he disapproved . The first of these was Miriam Makeba , the African singer and wife of Stokely Carmichael . She was staying in Jamaica as the guest of Dudley Thompson , the Minister of State , but , when she applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a concert performance , de Roulet refused to grant it . He again showed me a cable that he had sent to the State Department , in which he referred to Miss Makeba as Stokely Carmichael 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " later as a " lilting songbird " and the " chanteuse of Guinea . " De Roulet looks back on his confrontation with Carmichael over the visa application with the unmistakable pride of a triumphant warrior . " He did n't even make me mad . I expected something , you know , really something fiery and passionate and articulate . The funny part of it is he 's a creep . " When news got out that de Roulet would not authorize the visa , articles appeared in the Jamaican papers and finally in the New York Times . Legally , the State Department can not overrule an embassy decision on visas , but when calls started to pour in complaining that Miss Makeba 's visa was being denied because she was black and married to Stokely Carmichael , an official in the visa section intervened . He felt that de Roulet was simply toying with Miss Makeba , and he ordered the Ambassador to grant the visa . Undaunted by this rebuke , de Roulet soon created an even bigger headache for the State Department when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolling Stones . This incident was equally troubling because Jagger was trying to get to a charity concert on behalf of the Nicaraguan disaster relief fund . De Roulet said he could n't grant the visa even if he had wanted to because he " had reason to believe " that Jagger was using drugs . The Ambassador entitled his cable " Rolling Stones Gather No Grass , " and once again he informed his supervisors that he would not grant the visa to the " pebbles , " as he called them , unless ordered to do so . An order was given , but de Roulet still refused to grant the visa . He said he would first have to personally examine Jagger for needle marks . He finally granted the visa . Persona non grata A IDE FROM AN OCCASIONAL minor incident , de Roulet subsided into boredom and torpor as he awaited news on his expected promotion . In the meantime , he turned his attentions to his race horses and contented himself with making friends with John Connally , then in Jamaica trying to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roulet roused himself to his old form . On one such occasion , he delivered a lecture to a mixed audience of Americans and Jamaicans in which he declared that Prime Minister Manley had an ambivalent personality , which he attributed to Manley 's mixed racial origin . But none of this got him into any serious trouble until he was called back to Washington to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating the abuses of multinational corporations . He was asked to comment on any actions he might have taken to protect U.S. bauxite investments in Jamaica . To the surprise of his audience of Senators , de Roulet freely described what he had done to get Shearer 's assurance not to raise the issue of nationalization . And then he dropped his bombshell . He said that he had managed to extract a similar promise from Michael Manley during the elections . The Ambassador explained that Manley and his advisers were fearful that the CIA might intervene in the Jamaican elections as it had allegedly done several years before in Guyana . In his testimony , de Roulet said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " as a gentleman " that the United States would not interfere in the coming election . In return , de Roulet said , he asked for and won a pledge from Manley not to raise the nationalization issue in the campaign . The State Department was dumbfounded . Ambassadors are not supposed to do that sort of thing , and if they do they 're certainly not supposed to talk about it ? at least not in public . The Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs , Robert Hurwitch , immediately asked for the opportunity to set the record straight . He was worried that the impression might have been left that the State Department had been a party to some sort of improper " deals . " Hurwitch acknowledged that prior to 1969 the United States had dealt with other countries in the hemisphere " as client states or with some kind of patronizing attitude , " but all that has changed , he insisted . No longer was the United States employing what he called " trashy tactics . " Hurwitch pleaded for understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was any deal intended , " he told the now-astounded Senators . And then he made a similar appeal to the press and to any members of the embassy of Jamaica who might be present . They must understand and make their countrymen understand " that there was no intervention by the United States , past , present , or future , none was planned . and there was no deal on this matter . " * De Roulet , who was listening as Hurwitch spoke , did not understand why the Assistant Secretary was getting so excited . " I think it 's perfectly proper to solicit something out of a politician when he 's running for office , " he observed later . It seemed to him that Hurwitch was making a bit of a mountain out of a molehill . It seemed that everyone was . Within a matter of hours , Prime Minister Manley had taken the drastic step of declaring him persona non grata , and overnight the incident was transformed into a raging national controversy , known in the Jamaican papers as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actions were the product of a psychologically troubled man . He discussed the subject during our last conversation together , also at the Links Club in New York , and as he slumped back into a deep leather chair he seemed to become philosophical . Manley he dismissed as a " latent alcohol . ic , " and Jamaica he thought of as " a hopeless cause . " But these things were peripheral , the merest shadows , and to say that he had been the victim of petty circumstance did n't explain the larger questions that were troubling him . He wanted to understand what had gone wrong . " The only problem , I guess , " he said , " is simply that I stayed too long . Now , if I had gotten out in time I 'd have been written up as the finest Ambassador Jamaica ever had . The thing that probably caused the trouble in the end was that I never lost sight of the fact that I worked for the United States government . " The Ambassador then reflected on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda comes from the Whitney family , whom I 'm sure you 've heard of , and my family had some money . You 've got a certain noblesse oblige in us- . That 's really what it was all about ? noblesse oblige ? but it was a noblesse oblige with an activist zeal . " De Roulet 's only real regret is that he might not have a chance to put his ability to work elsewhere . " I wanted to go where there was excitement , wheeling and dealing , where I could put to use the things I 'd learned in Jamaica . " When we walked out of the Links Club , we stepped into his dark limousine and he stretched out his legs as his chauffeur pulled away from the curb and turned down Park Avenue . The Ambassador suddenly gestured to the apartment buildings on his left and right and spoke with a restored note of conviction : " I know people all around here and all they do is complain all the time .
