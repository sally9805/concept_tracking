THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE issue of a reporter 's right to protect confidential sources , his , : so many issues , has arrived before the public enclosed in a little cocoon of misinformation and misconception . It is not true , for instance , as defenders of that right usually suggest , that the Supreme Court , in its decision last June against Earl Caldwell , of the Times , and two other newsmen , stripped reporters of an ancient privilege . Rather , in ruling that reporters have " no First Amendment privilege to refuse to answer the relevant and material questions asked during a good-faith grand jury investigation , " the Court was refusing to make new law in an area previously-unexplored by the Court . The reason reporters and others wanted new law was to cover a new threat ; namely , the misuse of grand juries by the Justice Department and local district attorneys to " undermine the historic independence of the press by attempting to annex the journalistic profession as an investigative arm of government , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he was joined by Justices Marshall and Brennan . The difference is important , for it means that newsmen , having noted a growing indifference , and even hostility , to the press on the part of executive authorities , legislators , and judges , and , perhaps , the public as well , are now in the position of having to turn for relief not to clear precedents in the law but to those same executive authorities , legislators , and judges , and that same public , for relief through new law . The opponents of the new right that the newsmen seek have also misconstrued it , but differently : by suggesting that it would benefit the reporters themselves . John D. Eh rlichman , President Nixon 's chief domestic-affairs adviser , has put it this way : " Members of the press often tend to think of themselves as somehow an estate set apart from society , with overriding rights . " Actually , the granting of such a right would make life harder for reporters . Few things in a reporter 's life are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , the public gets very little of this kind of information even without legal harassment of reporters , and nothing would he easier for reporters than to stay away from the messy business of confidential sources altogether . But the public would suffer a direct loss , and the reporters ' new-found ease would he at the public 's expense , for one part of the news  --  the unofficial part  --  would tend to disappear . At the time the Supreme Court decision was made , it somehow failed to cause as much of a stir in the press as one might have expected , although Justice Douglas , in an unusually forceful dissenting opinion , which pointed to the deeper meaning of the decision , wrote , " The intrusion of government into this domain is symptomatic of the disease of this society . As the years pass , the power of government becomes more and more pervasive . It is power to suffocate both people and causes . Those in power , whatever their politics , want only to perpetuate it . Now that the fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press are broken down , the people are the victims . The First Amendment , as I read it , was designed precisely to prevent that tragedy . " Now four reporters have spent time in jail for refusing to testify-before grand juries , and the press , too , has become alarmed . The Court 's decision is discouraging , and at a glance it may look as though we were all waking up about eight months too late to enlist in a cause that is already lost . If this were the case , there would he nothing for newsmen to do but talk to the grand juries or go to jail . And , in fact , some newsmen have apparently come to the conclusion that the answer now is for newsmen to show a willingness to go to jail , in order to deter the authorities with a demonstration of self-sacrifice and determination . Journalists would pit their willingness to suffer against the government 's readiness to punish . In a recent article , A. M. Rosenthal , the managing editor of the Times , sug-gested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writ-ing in a jocular mood , suggested that " there is so much corruption , and they reporters chase it under such un-equal circumstances , even to the point of physical exhaustion , that many would almost welcome a little relief from the tyranny of the deadline to think and read even in the poke ) . " It seems worth mentioning that we know sonic journalists who would just as soon stay out of the pokey . Of course , any jour-nalist who chooses to go to jail rather than break his promise of confidential-ity to his sources does honor to his en-tire profession , but those of us who are not yet threatened have responsibilities that take precedence over preparing ourselves to shuffle off to prison with gallant or humorous resignation . The hemism is premature . There is still work to do . Newsmen are now in need of protec-tion from executive misuse of the judiciary . Ideally , there would he no such threat from the executive . But the threat exists . Next best would he a ruling by the Supreme Court which exempted newsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . That leaves the third branch  --  the Congress , which by care-fully designed new law can still protect newsgathering . Indeed , the majority opinion of the Supreme Court noted , " At the federal level Congress has freedom to determine whether a statu-tory newsman 's privilege is necessary-and desirable . " If Congress fails us by not passing the necessary legislation , the system to that extent has failed us , and then it will he time for the news pro-fession to get ready for civil disobedi-ence and jail . For now , however , the system is in need of protection . Civil disobedience is sometimes necessary , but civil disobedience is no system . The system 's strength  --  and thus the safety of all  --  lies not in its citizens ' willingness to endure torment but in the soundness of its laws . Costumes THEONI V. ALDREDGE is chief costume designer for Joseph Papp 's l'ubhc Theatre and New York Shakespeare Festival , and has been for twelve years . We have long admired her work ( the costumes of several current productions , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verona , " were designed by Mrs. Aldredge , and the richly embroidered tapestries of the costumes in last summer 's " Hamlet " in the Park keep running through our dreams ) , and last week we went down to Lafayette Street to have a talk with her . We found her in the throes of moving the costume shop from a building on one side of the street , housing a compound of Papp 's theatres , to larger quarters in a loft building on the other side . All around us were what appeared to he millions of spools of restless , jumping thread and thousands of yards of excited fabrics , but Mrs. Aldredge was calm , even serene . She is tall , slim , beautiful , and in her early forties , has patrician high cheekbones , and was wearing an unadorned muted-brown sweater and a gray skirt . " Soft colors , " she said . " I love soft colors , and very simple , understated things . I own half a dozen skirts and blouses , and keep changing them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love to touch fabric . Taffeta , brocade , silk , cotton , wool . Velvet , velveteen , moire . Chiffon . Crepe . I have a passion for fabric . I was horn in Salonika , and we moved to Athens when I was a year old , and I was brought up there . My mother died when I was very young . My father , Athanasios V. Vachliotis , was surgeon general of the Greek Army and a member of Parliament . He died a few years ago . I considered him a great friend , a very great friend . I was brought up in a house with three brothers , and you can imagine the cars and bicycles and assorted hardware , so when I got off by myself and dressed a doll , there was a special satisfaction . My dolls are still part of me . I have a MARCH 3 , 19 7 3 large collection . Wherever I go , I head for the native section and buy native dolls  --  not the tourist stuff . Many of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but some , from Russia and Poland , are in their original dresses . I never had a doll house , but I needed the dolls around me . They still sit around my room and on top of a trunk , looking at me . I consider them my friends . I look at them . They are never covered . They sit there , and we have something important between us . " Mrs. Aldredge paused for a few moments . " Back in 1950 , when I was quite young , I had some vague ideas about the theatre , " she went on . " I really knew nothing about it . I was mysteriously drawn to it . I mentioned to my father that I might want to try my hand at theatre in the United States . ' Why , you come from the country where theatre was horn , ' he said . I tentatively mentioned costumes . ' Why , you are living right next door to Rome , ' he said . ' The fabrics are in Rome . Rome has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens and discussed American academic theatrical experience . They suggested that I try the Pasadena Playhouse , the Drama Department of Carnegie Tech ( now Carnegie-Mellon ) , or the Goodman Theatre , in Chicago . I chose the Goodman . When I arrived in New Work , after a thirty-six-hour flight from Greece thirty-six hours ! I went to a movie called ' Caesar and Cleopatra , ' with Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains . A strange thing happened . I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the flowing garments worn by Vivien Leigh . They were very tight-fitting , very form-fitting . They flowed with an exquisite grace . They had a rhythm of their own . I learned later that they were a special pleated Egyptian fabric , and that they fitted so snugly because they were soaking wet and clung to Miss Leigh . I also learned that she had become ill from being wrapped in them . But the vision was one of loveliness . ' People can THE NEW YORKER look so beautiful in clothes , ' I said to myself . ' There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it started . At Goodman , I taught costume , and met Tom Aldredge , the actor , who was teaching makeup . I admire him so much ! I think he is a great actor . We have been married now for nineteen years , and it looks like a good thing , I must say . We have our own interests ; we never interfere with each other . My first Broadway costume was for Geraldine Page in ' Sweet Bird of Youth . ' We had been friends at Goodman , and she wanted me to design her costume . still have my Geraldine Page doll , wearing the proper costume . Then I walked in on Joe Papp one day , when his headquarters were at the old Hcckscher Theatre , on Fifth Avenue , and he said , ' Let me see what you 've got , ' and I 've been with him ever since . I do a great deal of outside work , and an occasional movie , and sometimes I will design a wedding dress for a friend , but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and / do n't like that work . When I work for Papp , feel I am working for my family . He even worries about actors ' feet ! I am doing about twenty shows a year now , and work closely with Milo Morrow , the costume-shop master at the Public . A fantastic man ! We have worked so long together he knows exactly what I have in mind , exactly where I am heading . He has a sixth sense  --  of color , of fabrics in the light , of material . " She leaned forward . " One tells Oneself one wants to do something , and one does it , " she said . " I start out with a costume plot  --  a detailed description of every single character in the play , every garment , every accessory . I plot the changes in character . I do watercolor sketches of the characters . We decide on a color scheme for a given show . The costume shop fans out all over the city , to every fabric house in town . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hunt up velvets , silks , cottons , prints , moires . We find leather . We find manmade fabrics . Morrow 's people pour hack with thousands of swatches for us to order from . We have trouble finding real silk and real wool these days , by the way . We dye our own costumes and perform miracles . Hire have five whole armies downstairs in the storeroom  --  all those Wars of the Roses  --  and they can be used again by dyeing and painting . Richness is achieved in many ways . We embroider a great deal . In any one garment , there may be as many as fifteen different velvets , woollens , silks . In Hamlet , ' there were different browns turning black  --  taffeta , brocade , and silk all mixed up together . There was red woven underneath the fabric . And there may be four or five layers , with different colors . The texture changes on the stage . The colors change . The change is almost palpable . Queen Gertrude had a huge heavy red velvet gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of velveteen , moire , brocades , all sewn together and heavily emhroidered  --  a royal extravagance . The light catches these things . The audience should be aware of them but not too aware . They are to help the actor , help the audience . You should look at them and forget them . But a tone is set . We make everything but shoes . We make period purses and gloves . Period pieces are easy for me , comparatively . I can go to the hooks . I pore over the art books , mostly for mood . The colors of Velazquez , Fragonard , El Greco ! Imagine a Lear with that lean , drained El Greco look , and those colors . " Mrs. Aldredge stared into space for a few moments . " I am thinking of a visit I once paid to the Old Palace in Krak6w , " she said , " where they have exhibited the tents of Polish warriors  --  room after room of them . Pitched tents , tapestries , even the slippers laid out , and always color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had me feverish . And yet I seem to stay with subdued colors in my costumes . Perhaps I am afraid of colors . I may be playing it safe ; the bright colors frighten me . Not , of course , the bright , whitewashed glaring white of the Greek rocks , or the living lavender , the positive lavender , of Greece , or the olive color . I can close my eyes now and see the olive color and the gleaming white . But then I open my eyes and know that we are no longer a laughing people . We thought everything would be over in a few months . It is now six years . But the rocks are still washed with white , and we will he a laughing people again . " Ethnic Ice-Skating ABIT of off-the-cuff sociological research has found its way to us from the typewriter of Milton Liu , the young Chinese friend of ours who last year favored us with his views on Chi-nese calligraphy and Chi-nese food . While skating in Central Park , it seems , he observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for itself : If you have hem ice-skating lately at the Loula Lasker Rink , at the north end of Central Park , y no may have noticed that a form of voluntary de-facto segregation takes place there on Sundays . In the first skating session , from eleven to one , the crowd is rather sparser than it could be and is mostly white ; it is made up largely of parents and children from the prosper-ous avenues of the East and West Sides . In the next session , from two to four , a new group takes over the ice  --  a busy mass of black and Puerto Rican kids enjoying what must he the biggest party in or around Harlem . There is some overlapping between the two sessions , but the contrast is as striking as that which exists in the housing patterns of the city . And yet it does n't seem in any way a hostile division , and the members of both groups join in admiring those cutups who , contrary to the rules , like to go swirling through the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it happens , the red-capped young attendants who are supposed to enforce the rules are often the biggest pranksters of all , but no one minds , really . ) This contrast between the two sessions perhaps is n't the most surprising fact you 've ever come across . But here 's another puzzle : How do you account for the curiously Chinese quality of the Kate Wollman Rink , at the other end of the Park ( and miles from Chinatown , it 's important to note ) , on weekends and holidays this winter ? I happened to stop by the rink on both the recent Monday holidays , and I would estimate that a good third of the crowd on both afternoons consisted of Chinese people below the age of seventeen . The rink was jammed with kids off from school ; it was a kind of holiday population explosion , and it truly was a case of every third child 's being Chinese . ( Do you know the cliche about the teeming masses of the Orient ? Well , there they were , teeming over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) You would have thought there was some sort of ancient Chinese religious ceremony concerned with ice-skating and timed to coincide with the Chinese New Year , which always falls around Lincoln 's Birthday . But the fact is that , whatever else we Chinese may have invented , we did not invent ice-skating  --  we were still writing poetry when the Scandinavians began skimming across their lakes and fjords on reindeer bones  --  and although people in the north of China do skate now , there is nothing in our history to suggest why the sport should he so popular among Chinese people here . I know that when I was a Chinese person below the age of seventeen in New York , ice-skating was no big thing . The big thing then was to save money to buy a bike , and then to ride the bike uptown and across the George Washington Bridge and along the New Jersey Palisades , which was about as much teeming as any of us ever felt up to . W. H. Auden praised Freud : " All that he did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To he quite honest , then , I am not on very chummy terms with anyone in the present skating generation , and so , in order to satisfy my curiosity , I had to walk up to a complete stranger  --  a Chinese boy in a yellow-and-red striped sweater , sitting on one of the benches on the margin of the rink  --  and ask , " How come there are so many Chinese kids here ? " To which the boy replied , " How should I know ? " That ended the conversation . I decided to refine my approach . I eventually found , on another bench , an authentic native type who was willing to talk about what was going on . He was Donald Sing , a junior at Stuyvesant High School . Wearing glasses and with a mop of black hair , he looked like an average New York Chinese high-school student . " Yeah , it sort of is a new thing , " he said after we had started talking . " I can remember  --  about seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a lot of new people came in from Hong Kong . I guess they skate because it 's cheap and there 's fresh air and they can come straight up here on the subway . I know some of these kids here . " He pointed to the faces gliding by . " They go to P.S. 56 or 65 if they 're in junior high school , Bronx Science or Stuyvesant or Seward if they 're in high school . They come every chance they get  --  on weekends , of course . Not much on weekdays , except for the cutters . " " Cutters ? " I said , thinking of the cutups . " You know , the guys who cut school . " He paused . " This is a good place to pick up girls , " he said . " How do you do that  --  run into them , or something ? " I asked . " Sure . It 's only hard if there 's more than one of you or more than one of them  --  I mean , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard to pick one out . I saw some good-looking girls here today . There  --  you see over there ? The pink sweater ? And the ones with her ? " I looked at the girls he was pointing at . If I were my father , I would have been shocked . They were white ! Or maybe Puerto Rican . But to think that a fine , upstanding Chinese boy ? Anyway , Donald and I chatted for a while . He said that a good time to go to Won-man Rink was the late session on Friday night , when there are a lot of Puerto Rican kids on the ice and some outstanding skaters . He himself was working on getting his crossover step into shape , and he was on the fencing team at school . I left Donald and skated out onto the ice myself . The sun was shining , and the recorded organ music was a little less maddening than usual as I glided to and fro . I began to think that this new Chinese rage of ice-skating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for chopsticks . What is surprising about that is not that the Chinese use them but that so many other people do not . Honeybees HAVING read in the papers , and listened , last summer , to New England scuttlebutt , about an unusually fierce South American bee that is heading north toward the U.S.A. , we recently , with some apprehension , sought the lowdown from Dr. Jerome G. Rozen , Jr. , the American Museum of Natural History 's former entomology chairman and curator of Hymenoptera , who is now its deputy director for research  --  a new post , which carries with it responsibility for the Museum 's twelve scientific departments and five field stations . Dr. Rozen is not only a hymenopterist ( i.e. , an entomologist who concerns himself with bees , wasps , and ants , the ant being a kind of wasp ) but an apoidologist ( i.e. , a specialist in bees ) . He has studied bees all over the world , and he has published forty-five scientific papers about them . Our session with him indicated that our fears were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee you have in mind is the Brazilian honeybee , " Dr. Rozen said . " It is a hybrid resulting from interbreeding between the African and the European honeybees . It looks just like our honeybee , which was introduced from Europe  --  it may be slightly smaller  --  but it is more active , and its buzz has a higher pitch . It is much more aggressive . As a race , it dates from 1956 , when forty-seven African queen bees  --  one from Tanzania and the rest from the Pretoria region of South Africa  --  were taken to Rio Clam , in the state of Sao Paulo , in the hope that a more productive honey-producing bee could be developed than the bees then in use in Brazil . " What nurtured this hope ? Well , the African bee gets up and goes to work anywhere from half an hour to two hours earlier in the morning than its European opposite number ; stays on the job , pollinating to beat the band , later in the evening ; forages at lower temperatures , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all in all , is almost twice as productive as the Italian honeybee  --  a variety long favored by many apiarists . All right . The hybrids , which became known as Brazilian honeybees , began to develop in Sao Paulo in 1957 ; " Now tell us about your burglary . " thanks to their African genes , they exhibited some of the aforementioned admirable traits ; local beekeepers smiled ; others took notice . But there was a darker side to the picture . The new bees responded to vibrations much more readily and nervously than the European honeybees ; colonies rapidly communicated alarm to other colonies by the release of secretions known as pheromones ; the hybrids were given to unprovoked mass stinging , sometimes emerging from hives in force to attack people and livestock as far as twenty feet away ; and they chased people for distances previously unknown in bee-dom . Deaths and lawsuits ( from animal owners ) resulted . The international threat developed almost at once  --  in 1957 ? when twenty-six swarms headed by African queens accidentally escaped , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than south , " Dr. Rozen said . " Two hundred miles or more a year to the north . They 've crossed the Amazon ; the Amazon forest was no barrier . They 've now reached northern Brazil and , to the south , Argentina . " An inter-American committee to study the situation was set up in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of our Department of Agriculture , and Dr. Rozen handed us a 1972 committee report . It states that the bee might well reach Panama in five or ten years , and Texas ( via Mexico ) eight or ten years later . Strict supervision of quarantine on all honeybees is recommended . This calls for the development of " barrier bees of a desirable genotype . " A step toward a desirable genotype was taken in Brazil in the mid-nineteen-sixties , when thousands of Italian queens were distributed to beekeepers to mate with the vicious hybrids . The Italian honeybee is relatively docile , and the hybrid hybrids were noticeably better tempered . Alas , apiaristic greed prevailed . " Keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the committee report notes . We thanked Dr. Rozen for our apoidological education , and he jiggled an inch-square piece of soft black leather , attached to a string , before us . " A test-leather , " he said . " The committee , on a visit to Brazil , dangled it before hives to sec how many stings it received in dint ) seconds . One man holding it started walking away after five seconds , because he felt that the bees were getting too excited , and they followed him for three-quarters of a mile . In the five seconds that the leather was dangled before the hive , it picked up ninety-two stings . Fifty are enough to kill a man . As a matter of fact , twenty five bumblebee stings are very dangerous . More people in the United States arc killed by bees every year than by sharks and snakes . " In view of this fact , Dr. Rozen 's technique of collecting bees  --  something he does every summer at the Museum 's Southwestern Research Station , in Arizona  --  struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers with a net , which I then put over my head , so I can see them , " he said . " They climb or tly to the top of the net , attracted by the light , and I capture them by trapping them between the net and the lip of my cyanide jar . Using this technique , I get stung once or twice a year at the most . "
