When he came from nowhere to win the Kentucky Derby , the experts sneered over their mint juleps and dismissed him as a fluke . At the Preakness , the horse they called a " ragamuffin " had the same experts choking on their clam cakes as he sped home the winner . Then the wisecracks turned to wonderment . Could he do it ? Could this rank unknown , this invader from Venezuela-Venezuela ? - make off with the most coveted honor in U.S. horse racing , the Triple Crown ? Last week a record crowd of 81,036 came to find out , as the big ( 16.1 hands ) copper colt went to the post in the $125,000 Belmont Stakes , the final jewel in the Triple Crown . A fleet , frantic 2 min. 30.2 sec. later , the fans at Belmont and millions more watching on TV in the U.S. and Venezuela had the answer : no . <P> Though he went off as the 3-to-5 favorite , Caonero II was bucking the far more formidable odds of history . In more than a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown ; the last was Citation , who turned the trick in 1948 . One reason for the scarcity of Triple Crown winners is that the grueling length of the Belmont -1 miles , against 1 for the Derby and l 3/16 for the Preakness-has a way of producing upsets . Another is that the competition among three-year-olds has become increasingly stiff . Citation , for example , was one of 5,819 thoroughbreds foaled in 1945 ; Caonero was one of 22,911 born in 1968-and a most unimpressive one at that . Indeed it is not so much the rarity of a Triple Crown contender but the ragamuffin-to-riches rise that has made Caonero , as his trainer Juan Arias says , the " champion of the people . " <P> Unclassy Beginning . Bred in Kentucky , the colt looked like an also-ran at the 1969 Keeneland Fall Sales . Not that his breeding was bad , but he was small and had a split hoof and a bad case of worms . A Venezuelan agent bought him for a paltry $1,200 and shipped him off to Caracas , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nursed through his early infirmities , Caonero grew into a strapping three-year-old with an exceptionally long ( 30 ft. ) stride . When Venezuela 's top rider , Gustavo Avila , was put in the saddle last March , Caonero reeled off three straight wins . Convinced that he had a winning combination , Baptista packed his horse off to the Kentucky Derby . Caonero , warned one Caracas newspaper , would be " hopelessly outclassed . " <P> The beginning , at least , was decidedly unclassy . When the horse finally arrived in Louisville , he was haggard , bruised , feverish and 51 lbs . underweight - just five days before the Derby . Arias , who believed that the speed trials favored by American trainers rob a horse of his stamina , worked Caonero at a leisurely trot . A 100-to-l shot on some tip sheets , Caonero moved from deep in the pack to win by 3 lengths . " What do they have to say now ! " cried the jubilant Arias .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
