The Gannett string of daily newspapers totaled only a modest 19 when its founder Frank Gannett died 15 years ago . All but three were concentrated in upstate New York . The Gannett image at the time was that of a celluloid-collar , low-budget exercise in small-city publishing , distinguished mainly by a ban on cigarette and liquor ads that reflected Gannett 's personal prohibitions . Then Paul Miller took over as his boss 's designated successor and the group took off . Today the Gannett Co. , Inc. owns 52 dailies and 14 weeklies , more than any other U.S. chain , and the end of its expansion is nowhere in sight . <P> Gannett papers now serve state capitals as far apart as Hartford and Honolulu . Last year was the company 's biggest ever for acquisitions : 17 dailies for a total of $130 million , mostly in Gannett stock . This year the group has already paid $14 million for the Nashville , Tenn. , Banner ( circ. 97,800 ) , and next month plans to take over the El Paso Times ( 59,348 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling at some 35 times earnings , stockholders at the corporation 's annual meeting in Rochester last week authorized a doubling of outstanding shares to 20 million-a sure sign that more purchases are planned . <P> Board Chairman Miller , now 65 , is an energetic Missourian who came to the chain 's Rochester headquarters in 1947 as executive assistant to Frank Gannett after an editorial career with Oklahoma papers and the Associated Press , where he rose from night filing editor in Columbus to Washington bureau chief in only ten years . Miller collects dailies for Gannett with the enthusiasm of a kid amassing marbles , and journalism may well remember him in newspaper terminology as the " Rochester Acquirer . " Because he travels so much for both Gannett and the A.P . ( which elected him its president in 1963 and chairman last month ) , Miller says that he has " come to know someone , along with the newspaper situation generally , in almost every city and town in this country . " That makes acquisitions easier : " So much of this is done person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a middleman . " <P> News-Oriented . Sometimes Miller acts upon sheer impulse . In 1969 he received a routine letter-having nothing to do with purchasing properties-from Louis Weil , president of Federated Publications . After glancing at the names of Federated 's seven papers on the letterhead , Miller promptly phoned Weil . " Look , " he said , " I see that you 're not in any states where we are , and we 're not in any states where you are . Why not talk about a possible merger ? " Only four months later , Gannett agreed to buy out Federated . Miller shuns the biggest cities , where purchase costs are high and prospects for circulation increases limited . His general policy is to seek dailies that are " dominant in a growth market . " Recent acquisitions have been principally in Florida , middle-sized cities in the South and West , and the U.S. Pacific islands . Gannett now even has morning , afternoon and Sunday papers on Guam , and Miller has plans for further expansion in the Pacific , which is growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
