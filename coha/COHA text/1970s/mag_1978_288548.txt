Some Christmas cheer for Bert Lance . First , Saudi businessman Ghaith Pharaon said he would pay $20 a share ( more than 33% above the going rate ) for 120,000 shares of the former Budget Director 's stock in the National Bank of Georgia . The $2.4 million deal should leave a fat profit ( a third of a million or so ) in Lance 's stocking . Then there was a gift from Wife LaBelle : a family portrait by Atlanta Artist Comer Jennings . LaBelle especially liked how Jennings painted her diamond pendant-the " broken heart , " as she calls it , that Bert gave her after he resigned . <P> A tempest in a c-cup ? Definitely , said White House Aide Hamilton Jordan . Nothing more , agreed Egyptian officials . Yet the story filled innumerable inches in major U.S. newspapers . As reported by Washington Post tattletale Sally Quinn in an article on the social scene in the capital , it all happened at a party tossed by Barbara Walters for the Israeli and Egyptian ambassadors to the U.S. When Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Amal Ghorbal , the Egyptian ambassador 's wife , " gazed at her ample front , pulled at her elastic bodice and was prompted to say , loudly enough for several others to hear , ' I 've always wanted to see the Pyramids . ' " Did it really happen ? Better ask the Sphinx , because nobody else is talking . Does it really matter ? Hamilton 's boss does n't seem to think so . When Quinn 's story appeared , Jimmy Carter 's only complaint was that it took up far more space than the paper 's year-end review of his Administration 's record . <P> A scene from Some Like It Hot ? The Seven Year Itch ? Actually , that familiar sultry smile belongs to Linda Kerridge , 23 , an Australian-born model whose role in an upcoming movie called Star$ shows she can give a pretty convincing imitation of Marilyn Monroe . In the film , Kerridge works in a Hollywood pleasure house where the women look like famous movie stars . Off-camera , Kerridge has little in common with M.M. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without roots , " says Kerridge . " I will not have the same problem . " <P> It was billed as " a light program in which the guests play themselves , " so Denis Healey , Britain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer , accepted the BBC 's invitation to appear in a TV parody of The Wizard of Oz . Decked out in a red cape and his own extravagant eyebrows , Healey plunks Over the Rainbow on a piano and hams it up with the denizens of Emerald City . At the end of his appearance , he called for contributions to the IMF-the International Magicians ' Fund , that is-and beamed : " You just wave a wand and suddenly find your pockets stuffed with money . " Now , if only he could get the British economy to do that trick ... <P> On the Record <P> Irwin Shaw ( Beggarman , Thief ) , after complimenting himself on understanding women : " I 'll tell you another writer who was ahead of his time on women . Shakespeare . Look at Rosalind , Portia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bella Abzug of her day . " <P> Michael Manley , Prime Minister of Jamaica , talking about the situation at home during a visit to Washington : " We 're going through some very tough times now . Great sacrifices are being made . No more Cadillacs , Mercedes or cornflakes. "
