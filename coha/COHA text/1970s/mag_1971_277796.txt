They are grown without the aid of chemical fertilizers or pesticides , and processed without the use of emulsifiers , mold inhibitors , bleaches , preservatives , binders , buffers , drying agents or any other test-tube additives . <P> A few years ago , the market for such products was fed by a scattering of faddists , who patronized a handful of " health food " shops . But that was before the back-to-nature spirit roused the young , and much of the rest of the nation was shaken by the cranberry scare , the mercury-in-tuna scare and the cyclamate scare . Says Marshall Ackerman , executive vice president of Rodale Press in Emmaus , Pa. , which publishes books and magazines about the movement : " I 've been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 13 .

Conventional supermarkets are also setting aside space for organic food departments , but most of the business is controlled by private entrepreneurs . One of them , Mrs. Mary Hatch , 65 , left a job as a mortuary organist to open a store in San Ramon , Calif . Says she : " I saw so many dead young people when I worked in the mortuary-so many who would have lived if they had realized that you are what you eat . " <P> The foods sold in organic shops can reach for the exotic : carrot cupcakes , sunflower-seed cookies and countless varieties of honey , including alfalfa , avocado , tupelo blossom , eucalyptus , mesquite and thistle . Manhattan 's Good Earth market offers 13 varieties of dates ( among them Halawy , Khadrawy and Zahidi* ) , three types of yogurt , including goat , organic ice cream and pizza and 125 types of herbal teas . The strawberries , lettuce , tomatoes and chicken can hardly be distinguished from those in conventional markets-except , aficionados insist , by healthfulness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50% more than regular foods .
