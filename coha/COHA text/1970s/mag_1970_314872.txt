With the war in a relatively quiet phase , the loudest boom in South Viet Nam these days is coming not from gunfire but from the economy . Where most nations at war-including North Viet Nam-endure rationing and self-denial , the South has spent the last few years on a prolonged shopping spree . There are no meatless Wednesdays , no food queues , few shortages of any kind . Shiny new appliances , from electric rice cookers to transistor radios , occupy conspicuous nooks even in the homes of unskilled laborers . Television antennas rise everywhere , even over tin-roofed huts . Saigon 's greenery has suffered less damage from Communist bombs than from the choking exhaust fumes of Mercedes autos and Honda motorcycles . <P> But the boom is backfiring , with an impact that threatens major trouble for President Nixon 's Vietnamization program . Unless Saigon can pay more of the bills-as well as do more of the fighting-South Viet Nam will never really be able to stand on its own . Last fall President Nguyen Van Thieu took some halting steps toward economic reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported consumer items ; Hondas , for example , doubled in price to $400 . <P> Last week Thieu and Minister of the Economy Pham Kim Ngoc suffered a major defeat in their austerity campaign . In late February , Ngoc eliminated the favored tax status of imported newsprint . His order was designed to 1 ) stimulate production of newsprint , one of the few industries in the South capable of immediate expansion ; 2 ) reduce imports ; and 3 ) prevent publishers from buying more newsprint than they need , then selling it at a 300% markup on the black market . Fighting back , the publishers began organizing a general strike . At the last minute , Thieu reinstated the publishers ' privilege . Said one Cabinet member : " This was our first test of economic Vietnamization , and we failed it . " <P> Massive Infusion . South Viet Nam 's economic problems gathered momentum in the mid-1960s , when the U.S. military buildup was pouring millions of new dollars into the national till . Inflationary pressures mounted , but the " swinging-door " regimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures by the normal methods of taxation , price controls and enforced savings . Instead , the government was forced to keep prices low by keeping the supply of goods high . <P> With a relatively small skilled work force and nationwide mobilization , South Viet Nam produces almost nothing to trade for the vast array of imports that choke its harbors and shine alluringly on store shelves . Exports total barely $15 million , while imports exceed $850 million . The only thing that closes this incredible trade gap is the massive infusion of U.S. dollars . This year the South Vietnamese economy will absorb some $400 million in direct foreign aid from the U.S. , another $400 million in Defense Department spending for local goods and services , and about $80 million in private spending by U.S. personnel and firms . The total is equivalent to about one-fourth of South Viet Nam 's gross national product .
