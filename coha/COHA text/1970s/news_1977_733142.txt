txt The Soviet security police today summoned an American correspondent for four hours of interrogation after he had been accused of gathering secret information . The correspondent , Robert C. Toth of The Los Angeles Times , was questioned at the interrogation center of Lefortovo Prison about a manuscript on parapsychology that he had been given by a Soviet scientist . Parapsychology is the study of extrasensory perception . At the end of the unusual session , Mr. Toth , who was scheduled to leave this weekend at the end of a three-year tour , was instructed to return tomorrow for further questioning . The Foreign Ministry , which , made the secrecy accusation , told him not to leave the country . In Washington , the acting Secretary of State , Warren M. Christopher , told Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin that the United States viewed the detention and interrogation with " serious concern . " ' ' Witness ' in Unspecified Case When Mr. Toth emerged this afternoon from the prison building , he said he had been summoned as a " witness , " but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a feeling that the phraseology is just a formality , that a witness may not mean that I 'm involved in somebody else 's case , " the 48-year-old reporter told colleagues who had waited outside the prison walls . " It may mean that I 'm in- ! volved in my own case . " Mr. Toth becomes the fifth American newsman to be accused of subversive activities in the last year . The others were George A. Krimsky of The Associated Press ; Alfred Friendly , Jr . of Newsweek ; Peter Osnos of The Washington Post and Christopher S. Wren of The New York Times . Mr. Krimsky was subsequently expelled on currency violation charges . In another proceeding , in 1971 , two re // porters , Andrew Waller of Reuters and Hoiger Jensen of The Associated Press , were questioned by the security police , or K.G.B , about their relationship with Vladimir K. Bukovsky , a dissident who was later tried and has since been deported . But they were summoned to a less forbidding office and were permitted to bring a consular officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice consul , sought to accompany Mr. Toth inside the building but was turned away . He later said that a Western journalist had no immunity and must obey official summonses . Soviet law does not provide for legal counsel during investigations , so Mr. Toth went into his session alone . The incident began on Saturday when Mr. Toth was seized on the street by five plainclothesmen just after a scientist , Valery G. Petukhov , handed over a manuscript on parapsychology he had written . The reporter was detained and questioned for three hours at a police station . Secrecy Given Broad Interpretation That detention was the subject of a protest made by the American Embassy to the Foreign Ministry today . In turn , the embassy was given a Soviet statement alleging that Mr. Toth was engaging " in activities incompatible with his journalistic status " and defining these as " the collection of secret information of a political and military nature . " The correspondent has called the charges " ludicrous . " After today 's session , Mr. Toth said a K.G.B . investigator , Maj. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parapsychology manuscript and his links with Mr. Petukhov , whom Mr. Toth met several months ago . " The impression I got is that if you get any information about science that is not officially released , it can be considered secret , " said Mr. Toth , who has written a number of dispatches based on scientific material that he has gathered independently . The correspondent said he had refused to sign a transcript of the interrogation , but had agreed to sign a statement that the transcript had been translated to him and " I have no objections to its major portions or something like that . " Mr. Toth , who is married and has three children , was about to be reassigned to Washington , where he previously covered the White House and the State Department for The Los Angeles Times . He has also been London bureau chief during his 13 years with the newspaper . Earlier , he worked for The New York Times . The Lefortovo Prison complex , where be was questioned , currently holds two prominent dissidents , Yuri Orlov and Aleksandr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges . The prison , hidden behind an eight-story apartment building on Energeticheskaya Street , was also where Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn , the writer , was detained before being expelled in February 1974.
