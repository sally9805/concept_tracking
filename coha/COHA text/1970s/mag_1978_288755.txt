THE FIRST TIME Directed and Written by Claude Berri <P> Claude is nearly 17 , and the only thing in his head is , to employ a euphemism , girls . Like every teen-age male in creation , he sees the world through a spermy haze , a green fog of concupiscence . He runs after girls in the street , and when he overtakes one , does n't know where to put his eyes , his hands , his conversation . He is quite normal . <P> Though nonsense of this kind is timeless , the farce is set in Paris in 1952 , and it is clear that Director Claude Berri regards The First Time , like his earlier films The Two of Us and Marry Me , Marry Me , as a roguish memoir . The mighty engines of nostalgia come into play as male viewers in their 40s , harassed by their own teen-age children and the spores of mid-life fungus , look backward with Berri . It is a rueful pleasure to watch Claude and his randy school friends stumble rubber-kneed after anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My God , yes , it really was that crazy . " <P> Female viewers may respond with anything from detached amusement to fury , because the film is utterly and blissfully sexist . If a defense must be advanced for this undiplomatic realism , it is that Claude is as helpless as a blown seed . This prank of nature is the comedy 's single but sufficient joke . <P> What is especially likable about the film is that Claude ( Alain Cohen ) is neither haunted nor hypersensitive , as teen agers customarily are in memoirs . He is a fairly good sort . His father , lost in the swamp of his mid-40s , ca n't quite figure out what 's wrong with him . But he senses that the problem has something to do with the generative urge . He speaks with love of his marriage to Claude 's mother , and it is clear that the love that is evident within the family has given Claude enough ballast to steady him a bit . The movie 's final frames show Claude not with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little sister play catch with a beach ball . The point is small , but not hard to see : for better or worse , the boy shown here will be a father , long after he has stopped brooding about being a lover . <P> - J.S.
