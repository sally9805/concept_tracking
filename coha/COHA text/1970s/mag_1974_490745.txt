THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment OVER the last decade or so , two standard reactions to had news seem to have developed in our country . One reaction is " It did n't happen , " and the other is " They all do it . " In the early Vietnam years , when the had news about the war was just starting to come in , the tendency was to react in the first way . In those days , since the citizenry still bad what politicians often call " faith " in our institutions , we tended simply to reject the bad news . It was not until about five years ago that the second reaction began to emerge . The historical moment when " They all do it " eclipsed the theme of denial may have been the indictment and conviction of William Caney . On that occasion , the public tended to believe , simultaneously , that there had been no massacre of innocents at M3 Lai and that there were massacres of innocents in all wars . In the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " took the form of the statement that all wars are equally brutal . A modish pessimism about human nature itself was revived for the occasion . Now the Watergate disclosures appear to have buried the inclination to believe " It did n't happen , " and " They all do it " reigns supreme . ( The President , who seems to grasp such changes instinctively , has gone to considerable lengths to spread the idea that Presidents be-fore him engaged in illegal wiretapping , took questionable tax deductions , and secretly taped conversations . He seems to be saying that all Presidents did what he has done . ) The two standard responses  --  the one denying abuses , the other seeing them as universal and probably eternal  --  seem to be at opposite poles , but the fact that they often crop up at the same time and on the lips of the same-people ( for instance , the President 's " I did n't do it " " They all do it " defense ) is a clue that the public , in its heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rendered roughly , the mean ing is something like " Go away !

If " they all do it , " only a fool would exert himself to stop them . There would he no need even to take the trouble to try ' to distinguish between people who did it and people who did n't . What 's more , one might reason , " If they all do it , maybe I can do it , too . " And if " they all do it , " that leads on to a still more attractive idea : that " they " are responsible for everything , and " we " ale responsible for nothing .

The world of undiscriminating cynicism , where no one is trusted and noth ing is believed , is in many ways a comfortable one . Every citizen enjoys the automatic right to a sly , knowing , and superior attitude toward all authorities but has no obligation to do anything about them . What is the use of changing one for another when they arc all the same ? In this world of cynicism , the people complain about the authorities the way they complain about the weather . Everyone . grumbles , but it leads to nothing . Politics is everyone 's cross and no one 's responsibility . " They 're all crooks , " the people say to one another , and go about their business .

Library 's Bobst WE 'VE just called on Elmer H. Bobst , the major contributor to Ncw York University 's new Bohst Library , on Washington Square . He is , at eighty-nine , a former president of Hoffmann-LaRoche , of Nutley , New Jersey , and a former chairman of the hoard of the Warner-Lambert Company , of Morris Plains , New jerseybotil pharmaceutical companies  --  and he received us in Warner-Lambert 's New York office , which is in the annex of the Metropolitan Club , on East Sixtieth Street . Mr. Bohst , now honorary chairman of V.-L. ' s board and a member of its executive committee , is a ruddy , white-haired , husky-looking man . We asked how he got interested enough in N.Y.U. to give eleven million dollars to ies library . " I can no longer drive my own car , because of vision , " he said . " I used to love to drive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , and a third in Palm Beach . . I had the most beautiful home in Mont24 JANUARY 21 , 1974 clair , built by Everette Lee DeGolyer , the oilman . I would n't say it was the most beautiful if I had built it myself . I lived at the Forest Hills Inn when I first came to New York , from Philadelphia , in 1920 , but around 1928 I found it expedient to build a home in New Jersey in Mon tclair . It was n't quite large enough . I was happy in it but not quite satisfied . One evening in 1936 , my first wife had some people in whom I did n't care too much about . The thought occurred to me : Why do n't you go and see the DeGolyer home ? I excused myself , and walked to the DeGolyer house . DeGolyer answered the doorbell himself , and I introduced myself . We had drinks in the library , and I said I had heard a rumor that he might sell his house . He said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible buyer , ' I said . He invited me to look around . Very spacious . Twenty-eight rooms , seven big fireplaces , a seventy-foot living room , walnut panelling , a wing of servants ' quarters of five rooms over a four-car garage in the courtyard . The garden had three levels . The trees were old trees  --  not planted by anyone of our generation . ' I love the place , I just love it , ' DeGolyer said . ' What is your idea of a price for your home ? ' I asked . ' It does n't make much difference now , ' he replied . ' My main idea is to have someone buy the place who loves it and who will permit me to revisit it . ' Stay all night if you wish , ' I said . ' I kind of like you , ' he said . ' I feel you would have the same love for the place I have , ' and he let me have it for a hundred thousand dollars . It would take three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal , and I went hack home . ' Where in the name of sense have you been ? ' said my wife . Well , you know , ' I said , ' I did n't like those people . Moreover , I 've bought a home . ' I lived there until 1964 . " " How about the Bobst Library ? " we asked . " I came from a relatively poor family , " said Mr. Bobst , who was born in Clear Springs , Maryland , the son of a Lutheran minister . " We lacked grandeur , but we had intelligence . I first got really interested in hooks  --  medical hooks  --  around 1902 , when I was a clerk in a drugstore in Philadelphia . I wanted to he a doctor , and to become a pharmacist first . I went to a library and borrowed ten or fifteen books that had to do with pharmacy , chemistry , and SO on . I was soon able to mix prescriptions . I became a registered pharmacist at the age of twenty-one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a lot of hooey . " Mr. Bobst never became a doctor , but he did become a pharmaceutical salesman and , in 1945 , president of Warner-Lambert , which now has assets of more than a billion dollars . " I 've read medical books for nearly seventy years , " he said , " and I 've also read Shakespeare , Dickens , Thackeray , Vergil , Cicero , and Caesar . I can venture to say that no one in our whole organization could quite equal me in general knowledge of pharmacy and medicine . I have taken a great interest in cancer , and have helped raise up to eighty-five million dollars a year for the American Cancer Society . President Nixon consults me about the Cancer Institute . I was influential in persuading him to leave California for New York in 1963 , and I helped get him his job , and fix his salary , in his law firm here . ' Come where the action is , Dick , ' I said . It 's wonderful how words count in bringing people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one dal he said , Look , your name is Elmer and mine 's Dick . ' That did more to establish our friendship than anything . " Libraries have been very important to me , " Elmer continued . " When President Hester , of N.Y.U. , approached me  --  at the suggestion of one of his trustees , George A. Murphy , then chairman of the board of the Irving Trust Company and of N.Y.U.-I said I 'd give six million dollars toward the Library . I gave it , in trust , in Warner-Lambert stock . Later on , when the stock had gone way up , it was sold , and N.Y.U. will benefit from the rise in the value of the stock . " ? ATRANSATLANTIC traveller tells us that on a T.W.A. flight he took last week the sheep were separated from the goats by means of a printed notice on his boarding pass : " If it 's a movie flight , the film you choose at check-in time determines where you sit . The mature movie is in the smoking section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dud THE other day , at four o'clock in the afternoon , we took an elevator from the ground floor of the Empire State Building up to the eightieth floor , changed elevators for the trip to the eighty-sixth-floor observation deck , and hastened to the southwest corner , where we had arranged to meet Gilbert T. Schmidling , the chairman of the Optical Division of the Amateur Astronomers Association , who was going to try to find for us the comet Kohoutek . In September , astronomers had predicted that Kohoutek would be the greatest sky show of the century , with a brilliance fifty times that of Halley 's Comet , and a tail extending across a sixth of the sky ; a shipping line organized a cruise to observe Kohoutek , an airline planned a week-long trip to pursue it , and a book was published to coincide with its arrival ? " The Comet Kohoutek : Greatest Fiery Chariot of All Time , " by Joseph Goodavage . In November , some astronomers revised their predictions to say that Kohoutek would be merely as bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in December it appeared that Kohoutek would fall short even of that . Before it rounded the sun , on December 28th , its tail , which would soon begin to flare backward under the influence of the solar wind , had failed to extend beyond about seven million miles  --  a small fraction of what had once been expected . In early January , when the comet was most clearly visible on earth , its brilliance was considerably less than that of Venus and Jupiter , two planets with which it shared the evening sky . While we waited for Mr. Schmidling , we examined our ticket to the observation deck , which said , " Souvenir receipt of a visit to the top of the world 's tallest building . " Far to the south loomed the twin towers of the World Trade Center , which even at that distance were clearly taller than the Empire State Building . When we pointed out the discrepancy to a guard , he said , " That does n't make any difference ; it 's the location that counts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the defensive about the comet , who insist that it is still living up to expectations as far as its scientific value is concerned . In any event , the Empire State Building still has the best view of Manhattan , and since Mr. Schmidling had not yet arrived , we took a turn once around the observation deck . The sky above was clear , but on the perimeter of our circuit a layer of haze lay low on the horizon , for the city 's pollution seen edge-on looked like a hank of clouds surrounding Manhattan , as though the island were in the eye of a hurricane . At four-fifteen , we returned to the southwest corner . The sun was just above the murk , and its reflection formed a pool of dull orange in Newark Bay ; it jumped Jersey City and reappeared more dazzlingly in the Hudson as a blazing sheet of gold . Sunset was half an hour away , at four-fortytwo ; there would then be a chance of seeing the comet , which was trailing the sun down to the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short man with a sandy mustache , he was wearing a brown-and-yellow plaid coat and cap , and carrying a stout walking stick ; he looked like an urban leprechaun . We had last seen him in 1965 , when he and some other members of the Amateur Astronomers Association brought a battery of telescopes to the roof of the Empire State Building to observe an eclipse of the moon . On an earlier occasion , we had spent the night with him and some of his fellow-members of the Association looking for red spots on the moon . We were delighted to see him again . He is a perfect example of a vanishing species , the amateur scientist , and , at seventy-three , he looked as lively as ever . He still teaches telescope-making in a room in the basement of the Hayden Planetarium , and he had invited some of his students to inert him on the observation deck that night . " The first year , we make the reflecting mirror ; the second year , we make the telescope ; and after that I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told us . Amateur astronomy in the city is n't what it used to be , he added ; nowadays astronomers , who like to frequent rooftops at night , get mugged and their telescopes are stolen . The comet would be visihle to the naked eye , and that pleased him , because he did n't want to be responsible for a student 's losing a telescope . Mr. Schmidling peered at the southwest and said he did n't like the look of the murk . It was four-thirty- As we watched , the sun impacted into the murk , which elongated and distended it , so that it looked like an egg yolk dropping out of its shell ; then , when the murk engulfed it , the sun was distorted in the opposite direction , becoming a flattened hail , like a yolk hitting the floor . As it sank farther and farther into the cloud , it became round again , until it rested , a swollen dull-orange hall , on top of Newark . A small crowd gathered at the southwest corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a tall , stringy tourist in hluejeans asked , and when Mr. Schmidling answered him , he said , " The comet ? There ? Now ? Wow ! I hit it right ! " He joined the group . Someone said he had seen the cornet in South Carolina a month earlier , before it rounded the sun , and it had appeared at dawn as a tiny red sliver . Below , lights winked on along Broadway , Fifth Avenue , and the Bowery . Overhead , Venus was visible , as bright as one of the automobile headlights down on the streets ; a few minutes later , Jupiter appeared -- a fainter light , to the left of Venus . There was no comet . We asked how to compute ten degrees above the horizon , where the comet should be , and Mr. Schmidling replied that as the moon was half a degree in diameter , we should look for the comet a distance of twenty moon diameters above the setting sun  --  a method we found difficult , particularly since the moon was nowhere in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us said that she had come all the way from New Jersey to see the comet ; she could sec the Empire State Building from her hack yard , and she had long thought it would make a good observatory . She liked the looks of it better than the looks of the World Trade Center . There was still no comet , even though it was four-forty  --  almost time for the sun to set . A bit of the sun made a fat dome over Newark , casting up an orange smudge against the murk . Above , the sky glowed with bands of 3ellow , green , and blue . " The hell with the comet ! It 's a beautiful sky ! " Mr. Schmidling said . " It 's a six-dollar show . " ' Elie tall tourist in blucjeans corrected him , saying it was only a dollar-sixty-six show  --  the price of the ticket to the observation deck . The tourist took off a woollen cap he was wearing and used it to wipe off the window , which was getting steamed lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of murk as well . It was a shame , he said , that the comet had received so much publicity  --  which he attributed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's desire to keep space in the news . Kohoutek had not hail the same advance billing in other countries . He hoped the cornet 's poor showing would n't have an adverse effect on the public 's interest in astronomy . The sky was getting blacker now ; downtown , the twin towers of the kVorld Trade Center glowed like a pair of fluorescent tubes standing on end . Still there was no cornet . A helicopter hovered in the southwest , right where the comet should have been , but nobody was fooled by its blinking red light . It was after five , and Mr. Schmidling was sure the comet was well down in the murk . He was plainly irked . " That comet is bad news , " he said . " People nowadays say comets do n't mean bad news , as people used to think long ago , but since Kohoutek was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saturday-night massacre , a stock-market crash , and an oil crisis . It even has the power to erase tapes ! In 1910 , when Halley 's Comet appeared , some people thought the world was corning to an end , and they put their houses on the market , but we 've probably never been in such a dire predicament as we 're in right now . " He said he had had an easier time seeing Halley 's Comet when he was nine . His father had called him out onto the front lawn of their house , in Milwaukee . " We looked in the west , and here was this great thing in the sky  --  it looked bigger than the house across the street , " Mr. Schmidling said . " It was a beautiful apparition . " He hut-toned his coat , picked up his walking stick , and started to leave for home , saying , " I guess we 'll have to wait until 1986 , when Halley 's Comet comes hack again . " ?

" The Councilman was sworn in at the hotel suite of his father , former Mayor Robert F. Wagner , who stood in the pantry mixing drinks .

The Councilman said that his brother , Duncan , who was also there , taking pictures , bad given him two birthday presents ? a twenty-five-foot extension cord for his telephone , and a wristwatch . He said he had also received an alarm clock and a calendar . Councilman Stern talked about his swearing-in , two days before. , at City Hall , in front of four hundred people . He said that it had been " gargantuan . " Councilwoman Greitzer talked about her recent swearing-in . She said that the judge had held her hand . The ex-Mayor left the pantry to make a little speech . He said he looked forward to a good old age watching his son 's career in public service . He said , " I know Bob 's going to do a good job , and I think , in my humble opinion , that he 'll make an outstanding public servant if he can take it .

" " Yes , " said the former Mayor , who recovers himself quickly , " and you were late each time . " Then the Judge asked Councilman Wagner to hold the Bible . It was Duncan Wagner 's Bible , and it had a purple ribbon in it at Micah 6:8 : " And what doth the Lord require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk humbly with thy God ?

I will try to do well by that tradition , and by everyone in this room . Thank you all for corning . " The ex-Mayor had the last word . " I see my old friend Lou Kaplan is here , " he said . " He helped me in my first primary fight  --  for the Assembly , back in 1938 . He was a district leader then , and I just want to say that his two districts came in for me a hundred and seventy-five to nothing and a hundred and fifty to nothing . "
