The hoax , which had once seemed a thing of dazzling design and theatrical performance , thumped toward an anticlimax . Last week Clifford Irving 's elaborate production , the false autobiography of Howard Hughes , was replayed in lumpy , legalistic prose as two grand juries in New York indicted Irving and his wife Edith . One of the juries also indicted their burly collaborator , Writer-Researcher Richard Suskind . <P> In the indictments , the New York and federal grand juries agreed on the essentials : Irving and Suskind concocted the Hughes " autobiography " 1 ) through extensive research into material already published about the billionaire , 2 ) from a pilfered manuscript written by Journalist James Phelan for an old Hughes associate , Noah Dietrich ( TIME , Feb. 21 ) , and 3 ) from their own imaginations . In doing their research , Irving and Suskind visited newspaper and magazine libraries in Las Vegas , Houston , New York and other cities , including that of LIFE , which had a contract to publish excerpts from the manuscript . Thus steeped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Howard Hughes , each alternately being interviewed by the other , to produce the question-and-answer dialogue form that the book eventually took . They apparently thought they could get by with the hoax because they suspected Hughes might either be dead or " not of sufficient mental or physical capacity to denounce " the book . <P> One of the most persistently intriguing puzzles was who had penned the expert Hughes forgeries that persuaded McGraw-Hill and some handwriting authorities that the autobiography was legitimate . The government answer : Irving himself . The indictments claim that Irving modeled his forgeries on magazine photographs showing lines from a handwritten Hughes letter . During a recent long session with federal authorities , Irving astonished the prosecutors by dashing off a near-perfect specimen of Hughes ' handwriting . <P> Doubts . The indictments left many questions unanswered and many people unsatisfied . Hughes ' agents are convinced that more conspirators were involved-including possibly someone who taught Irving how to forge so expertly and some former Hughes associates who may have supplied additional information for the book . Thus , no matter how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably continue working on the remaining mysteries . <P> The Government 's files are probably closed for the present . The chargees against the three defendants-including grand larceny , conspiracy , perjury and mail fraud-could theoretically result in sentences of more than 100 years in prison for each defendant . But if the three plead guilty this week and can return the $750,000 they extracted from McGraw-Hill , there is a chance that Irving may receive a light sentence and serve as little as six months , with Edith getting a suspended sentence in return for cooperation with authorities and Suskind being sent up for a short stretch in a state prison .
