txt Airlines are revving up their engines in opposition to President Ford 's latest move to loosen government controls over domestic air carriers . President Ford 's proposal to lift economic regulations from domestic airlines is intended to lower air fares for Americans , open up airways to new carriers , and foster competition that would be good for industry and passengers alike . Industry officials argue that the President 's plan would drive some financially hard-pressed airlines out of business ? but most importantly , they stress , travelers in small-and medium-sized cities would suffer , because virtually all airlines would abandon less profitable routes in favor of heavily traveled ones ? such as those between New York and Miami , and between New York and Los Angeles . A spokesman for the Air Transport Aw.oeiation ( ATA ) , which includes virtually all scheduled airlines , also argues that freight and mail shipments to smaller communities would be delayed , too . // * Airline proposal // Mr. Ford 's proposed legislation , presented to Congress this week , is not likely to make it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the sweeping proposal . Rep. Gene Snyder , ranking Republican on the House aviation subcommittee , is among those expressing reservations about going so far in deregulating the industry . However , the Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) and other regulatory agencies have come under strong criticism recently ; the Ford administration joined in the attacks earlier this year , calling the board 's impact " inequitable , inefficient , and uneconomical . " The Ford proposal is part of a larger package intended to reduce the roles of all government regulatory agencies . The President told Congress that the CAB 's rigid controls serve to " stifle competition , increase cost to travelers , makes the industry less efficient than it could be , and denies large segments of the American public access to lower cost air transportation . " The ATA argues that initially air fares might drop for a short time , under the Ford plan , but eventually rising fuel and labor costs would force fares back up again . " There is just no way around fuel and labor costs , " remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped from 12 cents a gallon in 1973 to 30 cents a gallon in August , 1975 . The airlines agree that some " streamling " of government regulations is needed , but they contend the President 's plan goes too far . Industry officials contend that instead of luring new carriers into , business , " the present airlines would be going at each other , it would be destructive in the long run . "
