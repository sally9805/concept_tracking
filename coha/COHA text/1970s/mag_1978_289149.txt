It 's a bird , it 's a plane , it 's a film that 's fun for everyone <P> In May 1974 , at 5:30 in the afternoon , cocktail time at the Cannes Film Festival , an airplane flew over the strip of beach trailing a long banner announcing a new movie called Superman . In May <P> 1975 , three planes flew along the beach , and the announcement was repeated . In <P> 1976 , same time , same place , same message-but now there were five planes , two helicopters and one blimp buzzing above the overpriced <P> sand , and in the water opposite the Carlton Hotel , where the big-money deals are made , bobbed a flotilla of eight boats , each with a different letter painted on its sail : SUPERMAN . By <P> 1977 , the Superman squadron had become something of a joke , and by <P> 1978 , it was a tradition , like topless starlets and surly <P> waiters . Whatever else he was , this Superman was obviously not faster than a speeding bullet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because now , 4 years after he was announced , Superman is finally arriving . <P> <P> By May there probably wo n't be a kid on the block or rue or Strasse who has not seen him soar at least once . Not since Star Wars , the alltime champ , has there been such an entertaining movie for children of all ages . It has a few flaws , but Superman is nonetheless two hours and 15 minutes of pure fun , fancy and adventure . <P> It has , moreover , one very special special effect : human flying . In Star Wars , audiences wanted to see space flights and talking robots . In Close Encounters of the Third Kind , they wanted to find out what flying saucers and extraterrestrial beings might look like . In Superman , they will want to see if modern movie technology can make a man fly convincingly . " The film stands or falls on whether the characters appear to fly , " says Terence Stamp , who plays the villainous General Zod . " If they do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definition , at any rate , the movie will be a smash . Superman not only flies better and faster than any bird or plane , but he does aerial acrobatics that would cause an eagle to fasten its seat belt . <P> Superman will almost certainly be this year 's big Christmas movie . <P> There will be a gala opening in Washington on Dec. 10 , followed by a royal premiere in London on Dec. 13 . The film will then open in 700 theaters in most of the English-speaking world , and the rest of the globe will wait until early next year . " It 's a kids ' movie that adults will go to that kids will like , " is the rather convoluted way that Director Richard Donner , 48 , explains Superman 's appeal . " No , " says Producer Ilya Salkind , 31 , who often disagrees with Donner . " It 's an adult picture that kids will see . " No , again , says Co-Producer Pierre Spengler , also 31 , who sometimes disputes <P> Salkind and almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for adults . "
