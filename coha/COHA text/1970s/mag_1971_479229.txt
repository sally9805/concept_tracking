Numerous prophets and travel agents advertise round-trip tickets to Nirvana , or to wherever else a tourist believes he might find God consciousness . It is the third day of our quest for enlightenment . We are wandering through leaves , in a birch grove , solitary figures , not speaking , asking silently , intoning repeatedly until we are dizzy and numb : " Who am I ? " We have suffered through intense desire and despair , weakness and exhilaration , doubt and calm disinterest . And now we are waiting . What has kept us here is the wish , the hope for and the need to seek inner peace . We are sweating , and the men have three-day growths of stubble . We have eaten millet and swallowed great handfuls of vitamins , and slept on the floor , head to toe . We have screamed and cried and hugged and stared into space . What has carried as is the power of what we are promised : a sudden crack in the consciousness , a splitting open of the soul , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who , exactly , we are . Salvation ! THERE IS A MOVEMENT easing across the land , a movement in which individuals are trying to work out personal salvation ? a way to proceed through life with harmony and peace , a minimum of tension , and a maximum of fulfillment . What we are witnessing is the flowering of a generation of seekers , a generation whose world boundaries were shattered by drugs . politics , street-fighting , encounters , communes , or rapid social change , and who came to believe in the possibility of an answer , a key that would make life better immediately . The keys now being taught , traded , and sold do not require withdrawal from the world or total rejection of straight society . One will not have to spend thousands of dollars , or five years in psychoanalysis , or twenty years of meditation in a cave . The methods are practical : exercise , chants , ritual , diet , relating systems , learning to control brain waves . They promise to bring a natural high , ecstasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivating his garden , seeking inner peace , will lead , it is felt . to world peace . Swami Kriyananda , an American who was initiated as a swami in the Self-Realization Fellowship , tells his disciples : " People must be saved and peaceful , before they can save the world and make it peaceful . " Scott Wren , a thoughtful , twenty-year-old student in California , who has been practicing yoga for two years , says , " It 's not a cop-out . I do n't want to withdraw from the world , I want to change it . But how can we have a peaceful society if there 's no peace within us ? " Because of doomsday warnings , which seekers take literally , there is an urgency to reach satori now . Crash programs are appealing . Many groups have accelerated enlightenment devices , and the Silva Mind Control Institute guarantees that after a four-day course , each person will be able to exercise psychic powers , to tap into the universal consciousness ? or get his money back ( $1501 . Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " enlightenment intensive " which produces dramatic results in three to five days , says , " The emphasis everywhere is on technique . Kids are coming by the droves out of the drug experience into the spiritual movement , and they wo n't tolerate nonsense . They say , your ideas are wonderful but show me what to do . The sharper and more exact the technique , the more the kids respond . If the kids try your technique and it does n't do what you say , they drop you . Those teachings which are doing well now are the ones that deliver the goods . " Success has not been limited . though , to groups which teach effective techniques . Virtually any spiritual organization that has outlined a path outside the establishment churches and synagogues has been flooded with seekers over the past several years . The 311 ( Happy , Healthy , Holy ) Organization , founded by Yogi Bhajan , who teaches kundalini yoga , opened more than fifty ashrams in three years . All schools of yoga have had wild bursts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation , Krishna consciousness , Jewish mysticism , Scientology , Abilitism , Gurdjieff , eductivism , light radiation , channeling , macrobiotics , Jesus Freaks , Fundamentalist Christianity , Sufism. mountain Buddhism . Taoism . Naturalism , psycho-cybernetics. and astral projection . The trend has also been reflected in rock music . Jesus Christ Superstar stayed at the top of the album charts for nine months , and record companies are investing heavily in " soft rock " that carries a spiritual message . In none of the spiritual practices , except Zen , are there any formal qualifications or public certification for leaders . Anyone may call himself a swami , a guru , or a reverend , place an ad in the local underground paper and wait for the phone to ring . An Indian student in New York did so as a practical joke . " Guru recently arrived from India now accepting students , " read the ad in the East Village Other . For three days , wearing a ratty silk bathrobe and a turban made of towels , he received applicants in his apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , but to his shock , only one out of thirty who visited him gave any indication of suspecting fraud . While the Eastern and occult religions flourish ; Christian churches last year showed the lowest gain in membership in this century . It is no coincidence that , in a period when young people are increasingly suspicious of and hostile to all authority , those religions which see God as the supreme authority to whom man must bow have failed to inspire interest . The notion of God being experienced and sought now is that of a force within us all , not outside sitting in judgment . The experience is found by taking Christ 's word literally : " the kingdom of God is within you . " Each person comes to his own experience of the truth , and all experiences are valid . It is an anarchic , egalitarian , self-determinist strain . Each man is seen as a continuous spirit , with the power to understand everything if he can just bring that power into consciousness ! IT IS 10:00 A.M. , THE FIRST SUNDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis campus of the University of California , 1,000 people sit cross-legged , palms turned upward and resting on their knees , with the thumb and first finger meeting in little o 's . Two women in saris , their hair pulled into topknots , bring flowers and burning incense to a makeshift stage . A bell tolls , and Yogi Bhajan strides out . He is a towering , heavyset man with the air of a potentate ? jet-black eyes and beard , a turban , coral rings , and a costume all of white , with cloth wrapped like adhesive tape around his legs . " Children , " he says , in a surprisingly shrill voice , " you are searching all the time for a teacher . Well , you are to become teacher for your own self . Who is teacher and who is student ? Same one . " He laughs . " Do n't start on spiritual path unless you want to end up as a teacher . " The audience sits perfectly still , while dogs race pell-mell around the bodies . Bhaj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly eyes and see the sky within you . Breathe deep , and vibrate loud : ' Sat Nam . ' " The crowd drones the syllables . Bhajan : " Inhale in you the kundalini. mother of creation ? more , more ! Pull the kundalini higher , towards the neck . Breathe deeper ! That is vibration ! " Sweat is pouring down his face . " Now chant : OM . Meditate on the sound current . Keep going ? time is now ! Three minutes only will give you an experience . Vibrate more powerfully ! " He mops his brow , reaches out his arms and shouts : " Continuous ! Inanity ! Keep on , pull it up . Get over your hang-up , man ! Strike when iron is hot ! Add more power ! " They om furiously , spines rigid , faces straining in the sun . " Inhale ? meditate on the third eye . Now exhale , powerfully ! " There is a loud , collective whoosh . Bhaj an smiles . " Relax . This experience is your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you alone who can raise the consciousness within you . Feel free , learn from everybody . Whatever can help you to reach the truth is the most beautiful thing . God bless you . " He walks away with slow steps , trailed by his retinue , and sits down on a blanket under a fir tree . Behind him , members of the 3H0 ashram in San Rafael are selling candles , natural perfumes , organic fruit-nut balls , and T-shirts that have Bhajan 's picture ? a giant grinning head ? silk-screened across the chest . A plump girl with auburn braids approaches one of Bhaj an 's aides . The girl says she is a teacher in Oakland . " I 'm into kundalini , but I have a lot of hesitations , and I 'd like to find out what those hesitations are . " She rattles on for fifteen minutes , while the yogi listens , no hint of reaction on his face . At length , he asks what she is looking for . The girl puts a finger to her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realization of myself . I 'd never thought about enlightenment . That 's just recently come into the picture . " The yogi smiles . T EN YEARS AGO , ACCORDING TO George Peters , who , as the founder of Naturalism , has been playing " salvation games " for almost that long , " no one in this country had ever heard of enlightenment . Now it 's being offered in mail-order courses . " As the notion of enlightenment is popularized , its meaning , predictably , becomes diluted . Many seekers anticipate it as a " blinding flash of white light " which will set them apart from their fellowmen . Others see it as a continual , steady growth toward realization of the truth , when the ego falls away , one transcends the mind and body , and merges with absolute being . The definition on which most spiritual teachers would agree is that enlightenment is a direct , personal experience of the truth . It is a truth which comes to one intuitively . which can not be proved rationally but is felt so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many different perceptions of truth , but consistent in all enlightenment experiences has been a sense of unity and continuity , of oneness with infinity . When most people first come into the spiritual movement , though , they are not looking for much more than relaxation . or help in solving problems . Yoga institutes are constantly being referred people with back trouble , who have been advised by doctors that the exercise will be beneficial . These people may be confirmed atheists , but after a period of exposure to spiritual seekers , some begin to question the certainty of their atheism . In addition , they see teachers who , unlike psychiatrists , put themselves forward as models of tranquillity . A forty-nine-year-old dress manufacturer in Los Angeles , who has been in yoga classes a year , says , " You see people like Swami Satchidananda and Indra Devi , who have eyes that shine , who radiate so much love that you feel great just being around them , and you start to think , well . maybe they know something , maybe they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more I think about it , the more irresistible it becomes . " W E ARE HERE FOR YOU , " reads a brochure taped outside the Los Angeles ashram of the Institute of Ability . Dozens of shoes lie in rows on the porch . Inside the stucco bungalow , fifteen people sit hushed on the floor , in front of Charles Berner , founder of the Institute . He is a soft-voiced man of forty-one , with blue eyes , a blondish ? brown beard , and a round , open face that , if clean-shaven , would recall that all-American freshness projected in the Fifties by members of the Kingston Trio . Before meeting Charles , I had read his booklet , " Abilitism , a New Religion . " The theory he outlined seemed preposterous : each human being is a God , which is defined as " infinite ability . " Before time , all of the Gods floated freely , unconscious of one another . Then , billions of Gods agreed to create time , space . energy , and mass , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of life , Berner says , is for the Gods to open up and relate completely with each other . " Life is the courtship of the Gods . " Now , sitting in a corner of the bungalow , he talks about his background . " I had a happy childhood in Colton , near Los Angeles , " he says . " When I was eight , I had the experience of waking up to life . " He began asking himself who he was , and what life was about . He " searched fervently " through 134 religions from the orthodox to the esoteric cults , read philosophy and studied physics and engineering . " I was very disappointed to find that science did n't have all the answers . " For nine years , he worked as a counselor in the Church of Scientology , then threw out everything he had learned to start over from scratch . Enlightenment came in the year 1964 , on a day like any other . Charles was standing at the orange and white pickup counter of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct , conscious experience occurred . realized that I am a God of infinite ability , and that the purpose of life is for us all to become conscious of each other as the individual Gods we are . I experienced this as the truth ? beyond the realm of doubt . It 's pure experience . " Soon afterward , Berner founded the Institute of Ability , and he and his wife Ava worked out a technique for enlightenment in which people would sit opposite each other , trying to experience who they are . and then present that experience to a partner . The stress is on communicating , unlike most other disciplines , where meditation is a solitary affair and enlightenment lies beyond words . Charles and Ava found that after a three-day " enlightenment intensive , " about half the participants would become enlightened " wham ? like that . The others make good gains , become more open and increase their awareness , " Charles says . " If they just follow the technique . they ca n't help but have experiences . Their enlightenment may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it will grow deeper and deeper . " I ask if the intensive would benefit someone who could n't conceive of himself as a God . Berner says , " We do n't ask you to accept our ideas . Most people who go on intensives do n't know a thing about Abilitism . Our masters never say one word about what you are or are not . But it 's funny . Everyone always comes up with the same thing , in different words . No one has ever come up with , I 'm a sack of mud , ' or the Communist Manifesto . They could , but they never have . " A ND SO I FIND MYSELF ON A Thursday midnight lugging a sleeping bag around the cavernous waiting room of the Philadelphia railroad station . A ragtag group gathers by the main door . We have come from all over the East Coast to pay $75 for a three-day intensive with Ava and Charles Berner . Charles , we learn , is sick with hepatitis , so Ava will preside with Leila Zimmermann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the driver , Arnie ( I am changing the names of all participants ) , passes out incense sticks . Although he has the face of an undergraduate ? sandy hair and freckles ? he is thirty-seven , an engineer . " After my last meditation , it took me an hour to get up off the ground . Meditation is a better high than pot , you know ? It 's cheaper , no bum trips , and no hassles with the law . " A girl asks why he is taking the intensive . " I want to become more aware . I 'm sort of at loose ends . " " Watch out ! " Arnie slams on the brakes : the car swerves around a bus . He mentions , later , that he took up yoga after wrenching his back in a car accident . Two more near ? collisions and we pull up to the lodge : a quaint , pink saltbox with a green roof and rows of white windows . Inside is a single sparsely furnished room , logs sputtering in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and a funny little stage with a dusty piano . Two of the men calmly remove their clothes and lie down on their backs . Two others are sitting in front of the fire , staring into each other 's eyes . Judy , a travel agent from Washington , lingers nervously in the upstairs bathroom . " I 've never been to anything like this . Some of these people have been on two or three intensives , I heard . " Shrugging , she adds , " They seem to keep coming back . " " Start waking up . Start waking up . " It is 5:45 A.M. A girl circles the room , speaking in a detached monotone . All the forms move at once ? shuffling , sneezing , surveying each other in the gray , gloomy light . There are twenty-two of us , thirteen men and nine women , ranging from nineteen to forty-five , although most are in their twenties . In addition , there are the masters , Ava and Leila , four monitors , and a cook . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing to the trees , others doing violent kundalini breathing while jumping in place . No behavior is regarded with any surprise . Ava gives us our instructions . For the next three days , we are to do only what we are told , " do n't eat or sleep unless we say so , " no smoking , no sex , no drugs or medication , " except the naturalvitamins we 'll be giving you to keep your body in a balanced state , " and no talking or thinking about anything but enlightenment . Ava says , " If you do the exercise perfectly for the next three days , you ca n't help but get enlightened . But the exercise is so simple , a lot of people do n't do it . " We are to hold the question , " Who am I ? " for the entire time . Those who have been on previous intensives work on other questions : what am I , what is life , or what is another ? We will choose a different partner every hour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say , " Tell me who you are " and we are to sit , open to whatever arises . " Anything that occurs to you as to who you are , tell your partner . Then go back to the question . Who ? Who ? You should have no expectations , you should n't want to experience this or that , you should n't even want to become enlightened . As a consequence , something will happen , " Ava says . When our partner is talking , we are to listen without judging . " To be open to your partner , do n't analyze what he 's saying or try to respond . Keep your mouth shut and just experience him . This is your chance to change your life-style , to be an open , flowing person , The complete end result of this is happiness . " We pair up and sit on the floor in two rows . My partner , Ruth , a social worker in her forties , says , " I 'm here because I need inner peace , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next to me , a girl is talking about her parents . Farther down , Fred , a young man with a frizzy beard and hawk nose , is shouting : " I am infinite ability ! I am you . I am us . " A timer goes off , and the monitor says , " Change over . " The first five-minute session is insufferably long ; the hour seems unendurable . When the final bell rings , it is only 7:00 Advt . We break to have tea and vitamin pills , which are arranged in bowls with signs , " Take one , " or , " Take three . " Ava says , " Keep holding your question . Who am I , drinking tea ? " My next partner , Tim , a thirty-year-old computer programmer , laughs self-consciously . " It 's hard to hold a one-way conversation . Who cares anyway ? This is absurd . I know the answer to who I am ? me . I 'll probably go away with the same thing I started with . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three days so other things can happen . Like hallucinations , mind trips . I once drove to Mexico nonstop , and at the end , I had road hypnosis . I saw myself from the back seat , " Breakfast is a bowl of hot millet with honey , and more vitamins . Ava says , " If you get a red heat in your body , that 's the vitamin . If you get nauseous , let me know about it . ' In midmorning , we bundle up for walking meditation . Spreading out from the lodge , we cross streams and weave over a hillside of silver birches . Some stand frozen , staring nowhere , bug-eyed . Others crunch rapidly through the leaves , sweating it : who is walking ? what is walking ? The next period , Miles , a slender , wry biologist from Australia , says , " I 'm just a mind and a body . " We hear Fred shout : " I am the sun ! " Miles says , " Seems like a lot of nonsense going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He shakes his head . " I wonder if in three days I 'll get through this blankness . I 've got no thoughts . " The sessions change drastically with each partner . Some speak in highly personal , human terms and are always influenced by what their partner has just said . Others talk only in abstractions , straight past their partner on a separate beam . Some who insist , " I am you , " or , " I am us , " do not really communicate or feel their partner at all . And one man , Simon , is totally beyond reach . He sits in a rigid , catatonic lotus pose , and when not sitting , moves dreamily in a perpetual yoga exercise , eyes half-closed . He can not look at anyone 's face and is skittish about sitting close to others . In the exercises , he speaks with a lisp , feathery and baby-like . " I find it very distracting to be near people . I feel as if I am in the presence of a snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need someone to make me feel the presence of the God . There is no one here to do that . " After lunch ? cottage cheese with bananas and sunflower seeds , plus eight pills ? Ava gives a lecture about enlightenment . " Do n't worry about whether you 're going to get enlightenment or not . Somehow it will just come to you . Then you should spend a few more hours working until you can articulate it extremely well . That 's the only kind of experience we 're looking for , because that 's the kind that will stay with you in life . " Ava is twenty-nine , with a childlike laugh and the radiance of a young girl . Her parents were both atheists. she says , " but when I was eight , I got enlightened and joined the Catholic Church . I saw a movie about Joan of Arc , which reminded me of an enlightenment from a previous lifetime , when I had spent all my time meditating from the age of thirteen until I died . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church at sixteen , and turned to occult religious ceremonies and flying-saucer meetings . She married Charles when she was nineteen , and worked with him in Scientology . " I 've been like this since my last lifetime ? just a religious nut ! " Ava stresses that we should have no preconceived ideas about how we 'll experience ourselves , but there is subtle pressure as to what would be acceptable . At one point , she makes a derisive reference to the " mud theory ? we are mud , we come from mud , " and everyone laughs . I tell my next partner , a young nurse , that the mud theory makes more sense to me than any theology I 've been exposed to . She screws up her face and says , laboriously , " I try very hard not to feel like a speck of dust . Sometimes when viewed in the infinite river of time , I seem very insignificant . But today , in this room , I feel much closer to that flow ? it 's as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through everything . " She looks transfixed as the timer goes off . The hours wear on , and exhaustion sets in . Legs are stiff from sitting , and muscles ache . We massage each other between each exercise . Any break in the schedule is a relief , even the period of " karma yoga " ? work . We chop vegetables , mop floors , wash windows . One of the monitors says , " Try to be one with the task you 're doing . Who am I , cleaning toilets ? " During dinner ( brown rice , beets , and carrots ) the monitors patrol to check that no one is " gossiping . " There is a walking meditation in the dark , and many more exercises . more pairs of eyes , more of what sounds like sophomoric prattling . " I am what is ! It just came to me , " from a boy who , an hour later , keels over and is diagnosed as having the flu . Fred 's shouts punctuate each session : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lee . a Japanese boy who glows with joy , says he has the urge to leave . " I do n't care about enlightenment . I do n't believe there should be a separation between the enlightened and those who are n't . Just love everybody . " Lee is always the first partner to be chosen . People rush for him and make dibs for the next session . Simon is the last ; he asks no one , and waits on the side , eyes averted . Finally , midnight : time for " sleep meditation , " after we swallow thirteen bioplasma pills . " Let your body go now , " the monitor says , " hut you hold the question . " SIT UP DURING THE NIGHT . A girl is walking by I the windows , giving instructions : " Let your body rise and fall . The mind never sleeps . . " Angrily , I pull a blanket over my head . Wo n't they even let us sleep in peace ? Twice more , I wake up and the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors who was patrolling all night . Leila stares at me . " It was n't any of us . " The others concur . " It was probably someone walking around in her astral body . These phenomena happen all the time . " Before the first exercise , Ava says , " I want to give you a standard for being open . If , when it 's your turn to speak you feel the need to respond in all sorts of ways to your partner , and do n't get right back to your question , you 're not being open . " Judy , the travel agent , says , " In life . do n't people like you to respond to them ? If you just sat there with a blank look ... " Ava : " If everybody could do that for just one month ? be open and listen , without trying to rescue each other ? we 'd have the most beautiful world you 'd ever want to live in . " I have the sensation of floating , peacefully , not caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their questions like the caterpillar in Alice in Wonderland . " Whhhhh000 ... are . YOU ! " Ruth pounds her fists on the floor . Fred , who has been quiet for a time , yells : " I do n't give a shit about this intensive ! I do n't give a shit about yoga . I do n't give a shit about anything in my life ! " Almost everyone giggles uncontrollably . Miles , the frail-looking biologist , laughs convulsively until he cries , flushing red . " It 's the first time I 've felt anything in these two days . " During our walk , the grounds take on the air of a loony farm . It is snowing , and Fred and two others run in circles , oinking and cackling . A man lies down in the river with all his clothes on . From afar comes a feminine shriek : " Fuuuck ! " During the meals , hardly anyone talks . The monitors are content . Melvin , a young man with a haunted look , approaches a girl who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel lonely , " he says . The monitor , with a lack of emotion that is chilling , says , " Is that all ? " Melvin : " I guess I want to make love to you . Do you love me ? " The monitor takes regular bites of her cottage cheese . " Umm hmmm . " Melvin : " I feel weak now . I feel like everything I do is just a release of steam , to avoid an explosion . " She waits several minutes . " Well , I appreciate your telling me all that stuff . I understand it . You should n't let it keep you off the track from holding your question . " Late in the day , Leila , the co-master , says . " Okay , you should all he standing on the edge of the cliff , ready to jump off into enlightenment . Were going to narrow the field now . Do n't say anything you 're not experiencing directly as you . If you 're not sure . if it can be argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not an experience . Do n't intellectualize or speculate . You 're not looking for an answer , you 're looking for yourself . " She suggests we try asking , " Who 's asking who am I ? " and then , " Who 's asking who 's asking who am I ? " and so on , " until you hack yourself into a corner . " I try it , and my body starts to tingle . I review , palpably , everything that contributes to who I am : eyes , nerves , voice , skin , senses , mind , feelings , needs , opinions , humor , particular way of looking at the world , a way I have always had . On the night walk , seeing the stars . smelling the trees , and moving through space make me feel acutely , dizzyingly alive until I am drunk with it . When we return to the lodge , Ava announces , " Someone had an enlightenment this afternoon , and it was Ruth . " The veterans of previous intensives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned , join in . One man gives a low whistle . " Today is really different from yesterday . " Arnie says , " I 'm beginning to feel something , a feeling of happiness and contentment all through me . But I ca n't verbalize it yet . " Tim is getting his road hallucination . " When I stare at one spot , " he tells his partner , " y our whole face disappears . " After each session , the pairs linger together , whispering and hugging . A twenty-year-old pre-med student . Jimmy , delivers each word with his whole body shaking . " I am ev-ery-thing . The fire , the tree , the dog , the wind . I am any-thing . I feel to-tally enlightened . " How can one doubt that his eyes , dilated and red , are perceiving a blinding white flash ? He requests an interview , and later , Ava announces the enlightenment of Jimmy , and of Melvin . who has been repeating for thirty-six hours , " I am infinite ability ! " Roger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust . " All I 've heard from them is bullshit . If that 's what it takes to get certification of enlightenment here , I do n't know about the whole thing . " N THE NICHT , I HAVE MORE hallucinations ? no I body this time , just a voice coming from all sides . I wake up feeling colossally down , with paralyzing aches in the back and neck . I 'm fed up with people 's bad breath and tired of being ordered around . It does n't help to work with Fred , who belches at me and then proclaims , " I am burp ! " Everyone except Fred is subdued today . We are all talking straight past each other , hearing what the other says but not responding , not taking his trip . We are into our own heads , on a depersonalized , metaphysical plane . I ask Ava how she judges an enlightenment . " I acknowledge it if I see it coming directly from the person . But it 's not important if I 'm right or wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better life , and the way to a better life is to open up to others . " By midday , I feel so drained and dejected that I 'm overcome with terror that I wo n't live through this . Leila tells us : " You 're coming up against the last barrier now ? the fear that you 'll die , that what you 've identified yourself with is gon na die and you 'll die . " In the next exercise , I work with Dan , one of the monitors , who has an Indianlike face with soft green eyes . I look at him through tears , trembling , and everything in the room ? sounds , images ? dissolves . It is as if we are spinning in a circle together , our eyes in the center , still . The room alternately lights up and grays over . We can barely talk , moving our lips but producing little sound . Somehow , his gentleness and intense warmth flow into rne . At the end of the hour , I feel purged and calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pops into their head . Tim says , " Remember I started this thing saying I was me ? Well , now I 'm at this : who am I ? Not me . I 'm the illusion of me . " Fred is into announcing himself as objects : Coca . Cola , a shoe , a razor blade . When a potato is dropped on his dinner plate , he says , " I am a baked potato ! " We wait our turn for interviews with Ava , like subjects filing up to see the Queen . She sits by herself " so her aura can be clear , " wearing a black gown of cut velvet , her dark hair curling down her shoulders . After dinner , she announces two more enlightenments : Tim and Lee . Lee shakes his head . With his clipped Japanese accent , he says , " No , there is no enlightenment . It 's her trip to say I 'm enlightened . " I ask Lee what he said in his interview . " I just told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . And when I open up to another , it makes my life richer . " Lee is my partner during the next session , and I feel great power and love shooting between us like electricity . Everyone , it seems , is flashing on the energy within them . You ca n't spend three days looking at your soul and come up with mud . Instead , you get high on your power and strength , your love , warmth , and elemental goodness . Lee , his eyes glistening , says , " I never knew contacts between people could be so joyful . It blows my mind that you open yourself so totally to me . You do n't tell me anything about your job , your family , your home ? you just show me your power . I can hold it in my hands . If I never see you again , you will always be close to me . " And then Fred shouts : " I am the great pumpkin ! " The whole room cracks up . Five minutes later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaud in disbelief , Fred claps his hands and punches them jubilantly over his head , like a boxing champ . " I just had a deepening enlightenment ? I 'm Chicken Little ! " The intensive ends promptly at 9:00 P.M. Ava says , " Okay . That 's it . Everyone has showed a great increase in his ability to become conscious of who he is . Those of you catching the train must leave now . " There is a euphoric flurry of hugging and dancing in circles . For the first time in three days , we learn each other 's last names , what we do in life . where we live . Only six of the twenty-two have been acknowledged as enlightened , and all but one of these had been on previous intensives . Roger drives seven of us in his Volkswagen to the station . " I 'm disappointed , " he says . " I thought everyone there would already know there is a cod , and we 're all part of God . The place was full of atheists ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have come . I 'm going back to Buddha . " I did not enjoy most of the enlightenment intensive and would not want to go through it again . Once home , though , I notice surprising effects . I am far more interested in listening to people : when I do so , they seem to unfold , with great pleasure and trust . Most of us , apparently , are not used to being truly listened to , or to listening in a totally open state . I find , also , that I can be freed from unconscious dependency on the moods and emotions of the other person . I can absorb and understand someone 's anger , or pain , or depression , without getting embroiled ? feeling anger or depression in return . I keep in touch with some of the people who took the intensive ; they are all trying to stay open and serene . One young man writes : " For the first time in my life , peace is mine to give . " I N EVERY MAJOR CITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a life in the spiritual movement live and work communally . The groups form a supportive national network . Members receive no salary , but their needs are taken care of while they study and teach . They can go anywhere in the country and be assured of a place to stay and a welcoming , loving " family . " They have a culture all their own : food ( vegetarian ) , language ( they refer to the world , for example , as " this planet " ) , dress ( Oriental fabrics , designs inspired from India , many choosing all white ) , and music ( flutes , drums , and , for chants , the harmonium I . In many of the disciplines , people tend to withdraw from sensual pleasures . The most serious are expected to be celibate . They give up smoking , liquor , and drugs . Convinced of the possibility of healing their own bodies , they avoid straight doctors , and would rather see a chiropractor , whose methods are felt to be more natural . The intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaped tremendous benefit from the drug culture . Acid and mescaline gave many people their first intimations of infinity and oneness with the universe . Since the acid experience could not be controlled , though , many began turning to techniques such as meditation by which people through the centuries have , by their own will , altered their states of consciousness . The success of spiritual groups in leading people away from drugs is one of their main sources of income . Almost every group has an anti-drug rehabilitation program , funded by charitable agencies and , in some cases , the government . One of the dangers of immersion in the spiritual movement , especially for young dropouts. is that it is possible to lose perspective , to suspend critical judgment , as one loses touch with the larger society . Quite rapidly , anything seems plausible . Nothing is too bizarre or outrageous . A nineteen-year-old boy in Berkeley , whose current trip is kundalini , says " I do n't know what common sense is anymore . I ca n't tell what 's valid and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques that smack of quackery . He does not consider the evidence when a spiritual teacher is charged in court with fraud or financial mismanagement . When a yogi who has a large following in this country was sued in New Delhi for allegedly taking money to procure American wives for Indian men , his disciples dismissed it as a frame-up by jealous rivals . Despite claims throughout the movement that each person is to he his own guru , many teachers , in fact , expect unquestioning devotion . Ronwen Proust , when she was eighteen , joined the staff of the Integral Yoga Institute . She was given the Sanskrit name Vathsala by the Institute 's founder , Swami Satchidananda , the most charismatic and beloved spiritual figure in the counterculture . Vathsala says , " I got into this spacy kind of peace , but it was a false peace that was easily disrupted if I went somewhere else . Nobody at the Institute was asking any questions , like : why do you meditate ? who are you ? what is this peace ? what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own consciousness . It was like I was stepping into someone else 's aura and absorbing his peace . " There is a tendency , also to lose sight of how closely related many spiritual techniques are to self-hypnosis , how they depend on the power of 49 suggestion . Katherine Da Silva , a twenty-sevenyear-old yoga teacher , met with hostility when she pointed this out to a crowd at a spiritual festival . Katherine lived for six years as a renunciate in the ashrams of Paramahansa Yogananda . Toward the end , because she was having what she calls " healthy . honest doubts , " she felt it would be better to continue her spiritual work outside the cloister . " I 'm so convinced of the power of suggestion , " she says . " Things like breathing through your skin . and channeling light through your body ? if you hear and believe these things , you actually start to feel yourself doing them . " Katherine is a dark beauty , with almond-shaped eyes , a graceful manner , and a voice whose cadences are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spiritual movement are magnetized by her ; many declare love at first sight , and tell her they recall being her lover in previous incarnations . She suspects that being an ex-nun contributes to her attraction . Katherine has a school in New Jersey , and also teaches yoga to psychiatric patients at St. Joseph 's Hospital in Paterson . One schizophrenic , she says , described experiences similar to those yogis talk of ? traveling outside the body , and being flooded with light . She asked the doctors how they would distinguish between the experience of a yogi and a psychotic . " They told me they would look at the person 's total behavior . " Katherine is aware that in yoga she uses techniques similar to hypnosis : the soft voice , the methodical way of speaking , and the concentration on parts of the body . Staring at a candle or chanting with eyes closed are used in meditation to induce a trance . " One of my problems now is that most mystics say their experiences come from an outside force ? the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-hypnosis , people can induce similar states in themselves , I 'm not convinced it 's an outside force . " I HE ADS SHOW BUDDHA WITH ELECTRODES pasted to his skull . " Now you can be taught to control your brain waves . Enhanced states of consciousness easily attained ! ! " For $250 , you can buy a headset made by one of the companies that have rushed into business to capitalize on biological-feedback training ( BFT ) . In the past few years , bio-feedback training has excited the scientific community , become an underground cult and the darling of the popular media . With BFT , people learn , through conditioning , to control functions of the mind and body that have long been considered involuntary : heart rate , blood pressure , muscle control , body temperature , brain waves , and thereby , states of mind . Example : a subject sits in a darkened cubicle : an electroencephalograph tracesthe electrical impulses of his brain , and each time he produces alpha waves ? one of four identified brain waves ? a color flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject can learn to keep the color onscreen indefinitely , or prevent it from appearing . At this point he has learned to create , at will , a state of consciousness in which there is almost no anxiety , a state generally described as " calm , relaxed wakefulness . " In early experiments , it was found that the alpha state is similar to a state achieved during meditation by yogis and Zen masters . But conditioning is easier to earn than meditation , and you know immediately if you are " doing it right . " As the alpha cult grew , droves rushed to volunteer as subjects in BET experiments . Dr. Barbara Brown , a brilliant , salty , utterly captivating philosopher-scientist , has to fend off applicants from her office at the Veterans Hospital in Sepulveda , California , where she has assembled one of the country 's most sophisticated BFT laboratories . Dr. Brown says alpha conditioning is not a miracle-agent . " I 'd put it in the category of aspirin , which is a useful drug for general annoyances but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says alpha conditioning could raise the threshold of our overall mental and physical state . " It 's fairly well known that in a state of emotional well-being , people are highly resistant to infections and colds . Through mind control , there 's great hope that people could chug along for long periods without having extreme anxiety attacks or developing any illness . " Dr. Brown has worked for thirty years in pharmacology , biology , psychiatry , and electronics . She has invented a number of mind-altering drugs , and administered one of the first doses of LSD to Aidous Huxley . Although she has read mystic and religious philosophy all her life , she says , " I never believed a bit of it . When you ask enough questions , you 've shot it ? there 's nothing left to believe in . I do n't believe in scientific facts . 1 suppose if I believe anything , ' it 's that man 's mind can do whatever it wants to do if it tries . " She says our culture has never attempted to nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities beyond those we know of . We 've stuffed it with facts , but we 've been bloody repressive about all kinds of mental phenomena like ESP , and astral projection , which I prefer to call depersonalization . We 're such a materialistic , exterior-oriented culture that we 've squashed the mind and the brain under . " Sitting in her office , with walls of green blackboard , she utters a dreamy-eyed " whew , " as she describes her future projects , in which people will paint canvases with their brain waves and create sNmphonies of " mind music . " In five years , she predicts , there will be bio-feedback centers across the country , where people can learn , under supervision , to control all types of mind and body functions . " But that 's just the beginning . We do n't know where it will all lead . Individuals will be reproducing states of consciousness that are not well known to us at the moment . We 're just approaching the foothills of the next evolutionary step ? the evolution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation about " fringe groups " feeding on the interest in BFT . " Those headsets are utterly stupid and misleading , because it would be impossible , for $250 , to construct an instrument that could accurately isolate brain waves . The components alone would cost $600 . " As to courses run by laymen , which advertise alpha conditioning as " the key to the promised land , " Dr. Brown says : " It 's true . Conditioning could be the key . Any of these techniques around now could help some people . LSD would have been a beautiful key to a better life , if it had n't been misused . But people should n't accept anything as the final answer , or they will be disappointed . It might be a key for you , but make sure , by comparing and asking : what does it do for me ? does it last ? is it real ? is it valid ? " H OW . INDEED , IS ONE TO JUDGE the legitimacy of or find a sane path through the exotic array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point have given in to the impulse to try a device that promised miracles : lose ten pounds in three days ; free yourself from worry with this mental routine ; experience bliss and Godhead by repeating a mantra . When it failed . some of us found it difficult to trust or try any similar techniques . The spiritual movement , however , is filled with people who search endlessly from one teacher or system to the next . When I began looking into it , I thought this insatiable seeking was a sign of desperation and delusion . Now I 'm not sure . There are , of course , people who flit about in confusion , but I have met others who manage to glean the best and ignore the nonsense in whatever technique they try , and who say that with each experience , they learn more and gain more love , quietude , and detachment from fear and conflict . Vathsala , who has been a seeker all her life , says , " There 's no end , that 's the beautiful thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking consciousness , no end to the peace and joy you can realize . " The search becomes , in itself , the salvation . A ROUND THE BACKYARD SWIMMING POOL of the Integral Yoga Institute in Los Angeles , on a Sunday in March , sixteen spiritual teachers and their followers are gathered for a meeting of the World Congress for Enlightenment . The teachers take chairs in a circle , the followers sit on the grass , straining to hear , as Charles Berner explains what has happened to date : " Last fall , Swami Satchidananda . Yogi Bhajan. and I met by chance in Santa Cruz , and we talked about the need for better understanding between the spiritual teachers of this planet . We came up with the idea of holding a World Enlightenment Festival this August , where a large number of people could he with the teachers for a week , camping on the land , eating vegetarian food , with no drugs or alcohol , living in love and peace and thus demonstrating to the world the Aquarian way of life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitations to religious leaders in all countries . " We have over 200 acceptances . No one has turned us down . The idea is irresistible , because of the rising tide of spiritual awareness , because of the Aquarian Age . " ' Swami Vishnu-Devananda , head of the Sivananda Yoga Centers and Camps , who flies about in a private airplane , asks where they 'll get the money for the festival . Berner suggests selling tickets for $5 . Another teacher protests . " This site will be a temple , holy ground . I wo n't go near it if there 's any money changing hands . " Muriel Tepper-Dorner , who teaches light radiation , says , " Money is not good or bad , it 's just energy . It can work to spread the light . " There is discussion later of how all the gurus at the festival can interact and " experience each other . " Berner proposes meeting in groups of five . Laura Huxley , widow of Aldous Huxley , says , " Why do n't we all fast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggles . " You ca n't tell all the teachers to fast , because if they do n't agree they wo n't do it . Silence is the best thing ? fifteen minutes ' silence , everyone praying his own way . " " No no , " says another swami . " The emphasis should be on communicating , not silence . " A Hawaiian " kahuna " ( high priest ) says the answer is to chant ? a Polynesian chant . Berner disagrees . " Everyone here can come up with something like that , and I can show you 600 more . Everybody chants , everybody prays , everybody 's into something . If we make any one technique mandatory , we 're finished , " One month later , many of the same teachers assemble in Davis , 500 miles to the north , for a three-day Earth Rebirth Festival at the University of California . It is a test run , in many ways , of the great festival to come . About a thousand young people are camping in a field , wearing Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incense , wood flutes , and finger cymbals . Almost every hour . there is a speech , class , or spiritual entertainment being given in the quad , Only a small portion of the crowd are Davis students . Most have come from surrounding areas for the " holy man jam . " Remarkably , there are no drugs being hawked , no beer cans or wine bottles to be *Astrologers are in disagreement as to what and when the Aquarian Age is . One school says it started in the nineteenth century and is dominated by science . Other authorities say it wo n't begin until 2150 , and will bring renewed spirituality . This seems certain : the Age lasts 2,000 years , and at the rate pop culture is exploiting it , we 'll be sick of it before it even gets rolling . seen . On the mall , girls are selling organic apple cider , pumpkin bread , vegetables and cara-coa cookies . Katherine Da Silva gives a yoga class to several hundred people on the grass . Many hold infants in their laps during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siddhartha Greenblatt , wiggles between his parents , aping their movements . When the group does the dead man 's posture , lying on their backs , it is an eerie sight : yards and yards of bodies , motionless in the sun , with only the dogs and babies crawling about . Later , people dance and gyrate to bongo drums , the men barechested , their stomachs sunken from fasting . As the weekend progresses , the vibrations grow increasingly bizarre and increasingly ecstatic . There is a speaker who claims to be a messenger from Venus . The Rev. Kirby Hensley , an ex-Baptist who lives in Modesto , and who has a pink complexion and fly-away ears , offers to ordain everyone as ministers in his Universal Life Church . With one hand on his hip , the other sawing the air , he describes how the ministers will be able to perform marriages and divorces , get draft exemptions , fly at reduced rates on Ozark Airlines , and attend a new school Hensley is starting " where boys and girls can come to practice sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up because boys and girls did n't have no experience . " " Far out , Reverend ! " a boy yells . " Hallelujah . " There is a scramble to get minister 's credentials , and 116 are ordained , including one collie dog . At sundown , Muriel Tepper-Darner , who says she is a channel for the White Brotherhood , gives a demonstration of light radiation . " Breathe in the golden light , and see yourself as a sun . Radiate the light out to each other until we see this whole room filled with light . Now radiate more light , and see it flowing all over this campus , and now all over the planet . " A freshman in a neat shirtdress whispers to her date , " I swear I can feel it coming out of my skin . " The boy nods . " I have to be careful , or I 'll get drained . " Next comes George Peters , the Abbie Hoffman of the spiritual movement , founder of Naturalism . George is thirty-two , a fast-talking New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender suede pants , with black hair to his waist , he tells the crowd he gets people enlightened by locking them in black sensory-deprivation boxes for forty days , or by giving them knockout drops , stripping them , and letting them wake up in a deserted field . Indra Devi , a seventy-two-year-old woman yogi who lives in Tecate , Mexico , shows films of Satya Sai Baba , who is believed by millions in India to be an avatar ( an incarnation of God ) , and is said to have the power to materialize anything from thin air . Afterward , she plays tapes of Baba chanting , and everyone sings along . They walk off reeling , euphoric , having given up long ago any attempt to fit things into some rational framework . The next day , Yogi Bhajan gives a mass meditation , followed by Swami Satchidananda , who is mobbed like a rock star . His disciples float about him in chimps , singing softly in adoration : " Sri Ram , Jai Ram . " Wherever the Swami walks , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scramble to get near him , touch his orange gown , kiss his hand , or snap his picture . After lunch , the teachers meet in the student union to discuss the World Enlightenment Festival . As at previous meetings , only teachers can sit in the inner circle and speak . A few staff members are disgruntled . " It 's cronyism , like the smoke-filled room . Only this is the incense-filled room . " Charles Berner suggests they break up into groups of five , as they hope to do for three days during the August festival . Yogi Bhajan says , " Good . I want five negative people , because I 'm in a very fine mood . " Berner , Bhajan , and Swami Satchidananda each start a separate circle . Ava Berner says , " The one rule is that you talk only about yourself , not about theology or your ashrams or disciples . Talk about what makes you unique , so the others can become conscious of you . " George Peters turns to Swami Satchidananda : " I once tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt ridiculous . How do you manage ? " The Swami says , " The robe is only an outward symbol of a person who dedicates his fife to serving others . Because I feel this dedication , I have no hesitation to wear it . " Jack Horner , a tall , gaunt man who created a technique called eductivism. tells the swami . " You 're one of the most beautiful human beings I 've ever seen . How did yon get there ? " Swami laughs . " It just happened , as a natural growth . I never even decided to renounce the world . I did n't plan to come to this country and start yoga centers . Things just happen . I believe in that . I feel that I 'm always at ease , no worry , no disturbance . " After an hour , Ava says , " All right , we 're through . At the festival , hopefully we could continue longer and have a chance to go deeper . " Charles says , " We had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very fine time . " Swami Satchidananda fairly rises into the air with glee . " We had a wonderful time . " Charles says , " After three days , I think you 're gon na get onto each other and will have the greatest high on this planet ! " The schedule calls for the teachers to conduct closing ceremonies on the Davis quad at nightfall . They learn , though , that in their absence all afternoon , the field has been taken over by rowdy students and teen-agers from nearby high schools . While the holy men are experiencing each other , the scene outside looks like the last days of Rome . Much marijuana , liquor , people shedding clothes , dancing and making love on blankets . A high-decibel rock band blares across the campus . Secluded in the pea-green conference room , the gurus are standing in concentric circles , eyes closed , arms entwined as they chant : " OM Shanti , OM Shanti . OM Shanti. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
