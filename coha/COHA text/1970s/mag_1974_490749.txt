THE NEW YOIllt 1 , 111 11 111 11 111 THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WHEN the energy crisis dealt its first sudden blows to the world 's economy , there were not a few people who believed that a " return to the simple life " might he here or in the offing . Visions of cozy rural communities , with " old values " fully restored , and of quiet cities filled with cyclists and pedestrians floated before their eyes . A bracing austerity , it was said , would bring the world to its senses . Now that many people are giving thought to the simple life , we decided to make a quick check of a few of the world 's nations to see how it is coming along . In Peking this week , the eye and ear were assailed by the stirrings of a new national " campaign . " In China , when the newspapers , the radio , television , and the loudspeakers in the factories and fields drop their standard propaganda and begin to pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign is under way . The lives of millions will he changed  --  although the Chinese do not yet know how and the life of the nation may be overturned . The last major campaign was the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution  --  an event in which Mao Tse-tung and his colleagues unleashed bands of angry youths against all levels of the Party and governmental bureaucracy . After some months , normal daily life was completely disrupted , and after three years the Cultural Revolution was abandoned . The new campaign is cryptic in its aims . It has no name as yet . The nation is to " criticize " Confucius , Schubert , Beethoven , and Lin Piao . This campaign is all the more obscure in that none of its principal targets are among the living . No one knows precisely what it is that Beethoven and Schubert stir in the human breast , but the Chinese authorities somehow sense that that 's the thing they want to stamp out . In Moscow this week , a recently launched campaign continued , but its targets were the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is no mystery . In his recent book , " The Gulag Archipelago , 1918-1956 , " Solzhenitsyn has revealed a large- part of the truth about the past of the Soviet regime , and the authorities wish to discredit froth the author and his revelations . Not long ago , his ex-wife joined in the campaign . Russian viewers of television , although they are not allowed to read the book , allegedly write to the Soviet authorities expressing their outrage at its contents . We turn now to the United States . The preoccupation here is not with writers and artists , whether living or dead . Here it 's the Devil that absorbs us . President Nixon had a few slighting words to say recently about " professional criers of doom and prophets of despair , " but the people who are lining up around the block to see " The Exorcist " were not listening . The experts are not sure why so many people want to see a film about a little girl possessed by the Devil . At least one or two experts think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our day 's insoluble problems . " My janitors are going bananas wiping up the vomit , " the manager of one theatre where the film is playing reports . The Devil is on people 's minds at the White House , too , where he is suspected of having erased eighteen and a half minutes of tape , according to the President 's chief assistant , General Alexander Haig . However , not everyone is carried away . The press , on the whole , has taken a " balanced " approach to the Devil . Newsweek opined that " it is prnbably lust as well ... that the fad will inevitably pass , for the Devil 's realm is dotted with pitfalls . " One clergyman , upon hearing of a supposed exorcism , declared that the problem had not been the Devil at all . That idea was " just plain funny ; " any sensible person could tell that the problem was merely a feu , ghosts . But large numbers agreed with the columnist who saw the new interest in the Devil as a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk was not of writers or artists or devils but of the prospect of " a catastrophe unparalleled in our postwar industrial history , " as one official put it . The coal miners had voted to strike , a general election had been called , and the economic life of the nation was grinding to a halt . In Britain , the simple life had given way to physical , not mental , collapse . They were calling it a new Dark Age . Clyde point in the career of AT a certain every famous athlete , the publication of a book with the athlete 's name on it becomes mandatory . ( It 's the same with politicians and game-show panelists . ) Last week , it was Wait Frazier 's turn . Walt Frazier , for the benefit of those who have been on Saturn for the past seven years , is the beating heart of the best team in the National Basketball Association the New York Knicks . He is an extremely graceful and handsome man . He flows back and forth on a basketball court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yogic . He has large , liquid eyes , and a beard and head of hair that look as if Henry Moore had carved them out of anthracite . He wears clothes that fit , and he drives a burgundy-and-antelope Rolls . Everyone calls him Clyde . In matters of style , Clyde is the reality of which black movie heroes like Shaft and Slaughter are merely the shadows . " Rockin ' Steady : A Guide to Basketball and Cool , " b1 Walt Frazier and Ira Berkow , is the book . There was a party to celebrate its publication last Wednesday afternoon , in the downstairs room at Jimmy 's , and we were there . Walt Frazier , wearing a black velvet suit and his usual composed expression , sat at a table and autographed copies of the book for a couple of hundred of his fans , including Willis Reed , the Knicks ' captain ; Red Holzman , the Knicks ' head coach ; and Howard Co-sell , the senatorial hopeful . On each flyleaf , under his name , Mr. Frazier wrote " Clyde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ira Berkow , the co-author , who is thirty-four and writes a syndicated sports column for the Newspaper Enterprise Association . Mr. Berkow has curly , sandy hair and a wide-open smile . He was wearing a blue turtleneck jersey and a plaid sports jacket  --  the kind of jacket that baseball players wear in hotel lobbies . He told us that he and Clyde had played one-on-one while they were working on the book , and that Clyde had won their first game , 11-7 . " How did you manage to get seven points off him ? " we asked . " I 'm a good shot , " Berkow said . " Clyde said , ' You made me hustle . ' He said he liked my driving left-handed double-pump hook shot . He really said that  --  I have it on tape . And my tapes work . No gaps . But they 're starting to wear out , because I play them every night . I think he was amazed that I could do anything at all . Athletes are always amazed when a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hit off Denny McLain in a pickup game . It was only a little dribbler , but it blew his mind , because I 'm a writer . " Frazier stood at a microphone and said a few stolid , traditional-athlete words about how much he owed to his FEDRUARY 1 8 , 1 9 74 coach and his teammates and what a great thrill it was , and so forth . Somebody asked him about cool , and he gave an answer that suggested he would be a hard nut to crack in an encounter group . " Cool is something that comes naturally to me , " he said " On the basketball court , I show no emotion , and I guess I 'm the same way off the court . Inwardly , I may feel anxiety , but I never show it . " Frazier said he did express emotion on rare occasions . Working on the book , he had relived some of his tougher childhood experiences , and had been moved . " Sometimes , " he said , " talking with Ira and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Labyrinth ON a recent Thursday night , we went to the Whitney Museum , along with some seventeen hundred other New Yorkers , to attend the private opening of the exhibition called " The Flowering of American Folk Art . " As we stepped off the elevator into the fourth-floor gallery , we saw a seven-foot gold-leafed curlew weathervane ; a life-size apothecary-sign sculpture depicting a character in Mark Twain 's " The Gilded Age ; " a " Peaceable Kingdom " painted by the Quaker preacher Edward Hicks ; a hold purple-red-and-green Amish quilt ; and a red-white-and-blue flag-patterned gate strikingly reminiscent of Jasper Johns ' paintings . The exhibition covers the first century of our nation 's independence-1776 to 1876 ? and will later travel to Richmond and San Francisco . It has been organized by two women who have written and lectured about American folk art for over thirty years  --  Alice Winchester and Jean Lipman . Mrs. Lipman is a slight , ebullient woman , who was dressed that night in a black-and-yellow dress carefully matched to her black-and-gold **32;4603;TOOLONG jewelry . She was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine , " which she had purchased around 1940 for fifty cents , the shopkeeper having explained that he wanted to he sure he got something for the frame . Mrs. Lipman told us that since then many thousands of dollars had been spent by various publishers and museums in reproducing " Winter Sunday , " and she went on to share some other thoughts concerning the growth of interest in our nineteenth-century folk tradition . " It 's often the artists who rediscover the treasures of the past , " said Mrs. Lipman , who also has a sizable collection of contemporary American sculpture . " The sculptors William Zorach , Elie Nadelman , and Robert Laurent were among the first Americans to start collecting our folk art , to look at it as serious art and take it out of the domain of curiosities or antiques . This was in the early nineteen-twenties , even before the first show at the Whitney Studio Club . The artists were impressed by those very elements of the folk tradition  --  direct carving , simplification and abstraction of form  --  which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comparable , actually , to the way French painters like Derain and Braque discovered African sculpture in the first decade of the century . Today , there seems to be an equally great interest in the folk tradition on the part of contemporary Pop and Op artista . Richard Anuszkiewicz is fascinated by quilts , for instance , and Andy Warhol collects a lot of decorated furniture . The kinship between Op , Pop , and folk has certainly helped to create the phenomenal interest in this exhibition . " We asked Mrs. Lipman if the renascence of folk art might he related to a nostalgia for solid American values in a period when they have been radically undermined , and she nodded emphatically . " It 's certainly part of our attempt to recover our lost innocence part of the same cultural fabric as young people wanting to go out West and ranch , instead of making careers on Wall Street , " she said . " Well , I do n't know about the nostalgia bit , " said Miss Winchester , a fragile , gray-haired woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray of bronze orchids sent to her by the Whitney . " I think it 's not so much a longing for what is gone as a reaffirmat ; on of what America stands for . " As we paused beside a life-size polychrome cigar-store Indian , we were joined by the Whitney 's director , John Baur , who told us that there was some disagreement among historians about the aptness of the term " folk art " for the exhibition . " Some great specialists , like Bernice and Edgar Garbisch , prefer the term ' na  --  ve ' for the paintings and drawings , " Mr. BRUT said . " They insist that the term ' folk ' should only be used for crafts . But ' na  --  ve ' does n't rescue us , either , because there 's an awful lot of art here that 's anything but naive  --  art that is executed by highly skilled craftsmen . " Mr. Baur pointed to a ship figurehead lent by the Mariners Museum , in Newport News . " Look at this figure , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highly sophisticated . " " Mr. Garbisch decided that ' naive ' was tight , " Miss Winchester said , " but we decided that ' folk ' was right . " " And we realize that neither term defines it exactly , " Mr. Baur added , with a patient smile . " Yet there 's no better word to lump it all together . " As the galleries began to fill with guests , we looked for Thomas Armstrong III , who is at present the Whitnev 's associate director , and is scheduled to replace Mr. Baur as acting director in September of this year . Mr. Armstrong  --  a tall , affable Cornell graduate in his early forties  --  was standing by a handsome exhibit of scrimshaw work . He told us that he had recently spent some years as curator of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection , in Williamsburg , and he seemed to think it a happy coincidence that the present exhibition should be the first major show installed at the Whitney since his tenure there . Like Miss Winchester , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed up with the Down Memory Lane interpretation , " he said . " What 's most crucial about this show , and has n't been stressed enough , is that it will lead to a radical reassessment of what was really important in nineteenth-century American painting and sculpture . This exhibition proves that the two traditions of American nineteenth-century art  --  the so-called academic and naive traditions  --  are parallel phenomena , extremely different in character but absolutely equal in value , with the na  --  ve tradition often more forceful and interesting . Until now , they have never been put on an equal footing . The folk , or naive , tradition was totally omitted from the Metropolitan 's ' Nineteenth Century America ' show almost four years ago , for m-stance , and is rarely taught in any university courses on American art . This exhibition answers such a question as Are Ammi Phillips and John Brewster , Jr. , to be considered as important as Thomas Sully ? ' The answer is a categorical ' Yes . ' " We went on to talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Hamilton Smith , designed and installed the current folk-art show  --  Brewer 's first installation at the Whitney . He was standing rather despondently alongside some beautiful small painted chests , having repeatedly tried to sit on one of the platforms he had had built for the exhibition and been reprimanded by the Whitney guards . " I have always had a great passion for folk art , " Mr. Breuer said . " I 've looked at it a great deal in Hungary , in Greece , in many other countries . I think that the most outstanding difference between American folk art and that of other nations is that it has a more extraordinary balance of primitiveness and sophistication . I faced no major problem in designing this exhibition except that of scale . Many of the objects are small and delicate and would have got lost in this great big open hall . So I designed a labyrinth , to create many intimate spaces . I kept thinking of Ariadne 's thread ; that has always been one of my favorite myths . To create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the standard interchangeable unit I designed originally for the museum ; the other is the two-by-four you see in every Colonial frame house . I 'm quite prepared for the fact that some people will be annoyed by the la by rinth . " " I ca n't stand this business of not be-mg able to cross over from one part of the room to another and being forced to go in one direction , " a young woman in brocade was saying to her escort as Mr. Breuer vainly tried to sit down again . " Is n't this some kind of aesthetic Fascism ? " " Oh no , it 's just Bauhaus , " her escort reassured her and , indeed , Breu-er was one of the early masters of the Bauhaus . In front of a painting representing the Garden of Eden , we chatted with George Weissman , vice-chairman of Philip Morris , without whose sponsorship , the Whitney people say , the folk-art show would have been utterly impossible . " Anyone can buy five Remhrandts and move them around , " Mr. Weissman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things that are dif ficult and challenging  --  that have never been done before . For instance , we sponsored a show of Pop art in the nineteen-sixties that was so avant-garde no museum would originate it at the time , and we had it circulated by the American Federation of Arts . In Canada , our Canadian affiliate , Benson &; Hedges , is financing a project whereby Canadian artists will decorate gigantic wall surfaces in public buildings in five major cities . And in Melbourne our Australian affiliate has given a hundred thousand dollars for the acquisition of works of young Australian artists . What I love about this show is that it has accomplished the same thing as the exhibition on the North American Indian we sponsored at the Whitney two years ago . It has taken folk art out of the ethnology closet and put it on a great aesthetic level . " " It 's a show that seems to make people intensely happy , " Thomas Armstrong said as he brushed past us , glass in hand . " It says to people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More Art THE 1974 NEW YORE ART DECO EXPOSITION will he a comprehensive and exciting event , combining the attitude and attractiveness of a museum exhibition with the commercial viability of a major antiques show . . . . We went to " The 1974 New York Art Deco Exposition , " at Radio City Music Hall , with a young man named Stephen , a young lady named Amanda , and some gripping promotional material . The gripping promotional material ( courtesy of Big Apple Events , 767 Lexington Ave. , New York 10021 ) told us that there was an Art Deco revival " afoot . " Stephen and Amanda told us it was over . " You know what the new thing is ? " Stephen asked . " I 'll tell you what the new thing is . It 's not trying too hard . " " I thought the new thing was Art Nouveau , " Amanda said . " Art Nouveau has peaked , " Stephen said . " The new thing is not trying too hard . " We asked . Stephen how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's tough , " he said . " So far , all I 've come up with is a cardigan sweater and an Accutron watch . " Seventy-five to one hundred dealers will exhibit . They will be provided with every amenity that has become standard in major antiques shows : pegboard or drapery booths built by a firm specializing in this type of construction , tables , chairs , electric outlets . . . . One thing about " The 1974 New York Art Deco Exposition " was that it messed up the nice Art Deco lobby of Radio City Music Hall with a lot of dumb-looking little booths . There was one little booth devoted exclusively to the work of Rockwell Kent , but mostly each little booth had a sort of jumble of things that did not call to mind , for instance , the attitude and attractiveness of a museum exhibition . We stopped at a booth that included hooks in its jumble . This booth belonged to Dwight Goss , of San Francisco . " Oh , look ! " said Stephen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We examined some of the hooks Goss had for sale . We picked up a 1945 Grosset &; Dunlap reprint of " The Son of Tarzan " ( marked at twenty dollars ) and put it down again . Stephen picked up a copy of " The Fred Astaire Story , " a photo album ( priced at a hundred and thirty-five dollars ) that had once accompanied a collection of Fred Astaire records . " Oh , look ! " said Stephen . " It 's signed by Fred Astaire . Oh , look ! They do n't give you the records . " At the little booth of Joe Macdonald , there were things of a different sort . " I have mostly ErtC.s and Laliques , " said Mr. Macdonald , a blond young man who deals privately . " Thank goodness some people know what they are . I 've sold quite a lot to the Japanese , and quite a lot to museums . The most important piece I have left is this . " Mr. Macdonald pointed to a ceramic-and-wood panel . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where they rent things out to movies . You can hang it on the wall , like a Japanese screen . And it 's fourteen thousand dollars . " Fashion magazines are likely to want to photograph at the Exposition .. . . The nicest little booth at the Art " Brooks Brothers ? Arthur T. Sturgis here . I believe a mistake has been made . " ? Deco show belonged to Lime en Papier , a Madison Avenue shop . At the Lune en Papier booth , there was a Mission Orange syrup dispenser , an old electric gum-ball machine , and a wonderful thing called a Rotor-Table . Tony Goodstone , a young man in a panama hat , told us about the Rotor-Table . " You 'll notice , " he said , " that the Rotor-Table has a stationary round glass top . Rotor-Tables were bar novelties , you see . You were supposed to keep your drink on the glass top and play the game , which rotated underneath the glass top , for more drinks . That was the theory . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , where you have a kicker that shoots the ball away . But when you get a ball in the free-ball hole , the traffic light does light up , and it does buzz . Also , it 's got the skyline of New York on it . " We asked Mr. Goodstone how much the Rotor-Table was selling For . " Weil , " said Mr. Goodstone , " it 's nine hundred and seventy-five dollars . " That about does it for the thirties  --  for good . But in closing we want to announce that we have in our possession a comprehensive and exciting collection of , noderne promotional material dating from the Art Deco revival of the early seventies , and that no serious bid over one thousand dollars will be refused . Still More THE Museum of Modern Art got TH thousand high-school and college students to come look at a Marcel Duchamp show by throwing a party called " A Valentine for Marcel Du-champ . " There were things to do at the party . Marcel Duchamp stopped painting in 1918 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so one of the events was a twenty-one-yearold chess master playing thirty-five games at once . John Cage knew Marcel Duchamp , so one of the events was John Cage playing a piece called " Music for Marcel Duchamp " on a piano that had weather stripping , rubber , and a bolt among its strings . There were also Dada movies , as well as a movie about Duchamp 's chess playing , made in 1964 , in which he asks the question " Why should I like chess , which is a very logical game and has absolutely nothing to do with crazy thoughts ? " A number of the kids looked at the show , and we heard one of them tell his date about Duchamp 's glass-panel work titled " The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors , Even . " He said , " It was n't supposed to be cracked  --  it got cracked in Brooklyn . " He was right .
