THE BASIC TRAINING OF PAVLO HUMMEL <P> by DAVID RABE <P> A couple of G.I.s popping open beer cans with Mama-san and her whores . Through the bead curtain , a hand lobs a lump of steel . Thump and roll . " Grenade ! " Soldier scoops it up , hesitates in stupid disbelief . FLASH ! BLAM ! So begins-and 140 minutes later , in an almost exact replay , so ends-The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel . Between these two unanswerable exclamation points , Playwright David Rabe strings the lifeline of the soldier , Pavlo ; then on that cord he attempts to hang what he sees as the rags of national honor , bloodied by the Viet Nam War . <P> To risk handling pain on that scale is a big gamble , and Rabe is a plunger . Pavlo was his first play . ( His second work , Sticks and Bones , develops related themes of the war 's moral crippling in more dimensions . ) Pavlo opened off-Broadway last year . It is now in a new production by the Theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The twin trajectories of Rabe 's fresh talent and Pacino 's intersect with concussive impact , splattering the audience with agony and unexpected humor . <P> Pavlo tells how a Regular Army slob stumblingly pursues through boot camp and battle the mythic promise of the recruiting posters that THE ARMY WILL MAKE A MAN OF YOU ! Pacino makes Pavlo a walking antipersonnel device , a Bouncing Betty that chops his foes , and himself , off at the crotch . Pacino 's previous roles ( most conspicuously , Michael in The Godfather ) have blazed with a menace that he now transforms into a quivering , infantile bravado , a would-be Lieut . Galley , played for explosive laughs . The only buddy he rescues is a dead one . The only atrocity he achieves is the terrified gunning down of a single old man . The only fight he wins is with another G.I. " Did I do it to him ? The Triple Hummel . A little shuffle and then a triple boom , boom , boom ! " And then we see that it is the defeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play is an antiwar cartoon , but a good one , and in the tradition that after all goes back to the Greeks . At the end , the dead Pavlo , head propped up in his Army coffin , wearing the tremulous smile of the child who understands his pain at last , explains what it means : " Sheeeeeit ! " It is the ultimate comment on war and atrocity , and Aristophanes would have laughed , along with the Olympic gods . Horace Judson
