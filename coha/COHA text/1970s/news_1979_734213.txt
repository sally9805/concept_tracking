txt In 1975 , when new American cars were getting an average of 14 miles a gallon , Congress ordered the auto companies to improve fuel efficiency to 27.5 by 1985 . But how quickly they had to move toward that goal was left to the Department of Transportation . Secretary Brock Adams decided to increase mileage requirements rapidly in the early 1980 's , and then ease on to 27.5 by 1985 : The average now stands at 19 miles a gallon . But Detroit is asking for a break  --  appealing directly to the President last week for a slower , steadier climb to 1985 . Such a pace , the manufacturers assert , would save billions in development costs and , for ailing Chrysler , might even make the difference between survival and financial collapse . Whether you buy the industry 's argument depends in large part on whose numbers you believe ; engineers at the Transportation Department scoff at the companies ' cost estimates . But given the high symbolic cost of softening the mileage standard just when oil conservation has become so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers . Washington 's way would save about 44,000 more barrels of oil a day than Detroit 's during the 1980 's ? about two-tenths of one percent of all gasoline consumption . According to the Transportaton Department , these savings would recoup for motorists all the extra cost of making cars that are more fuel-efficient . According to Detroit , the required manufacturing investment would be so large that no foreseeable increase in oil prices could justify the posted standards . There is no reasonable way for the public to know who 's right . The auto makers have a motive to exagReproduced gerate the cost of Washington 's way . The regulators have a bureaucratic and political stake in consistency . Still , it probably makes sense to stick by Washington 's stringent standard . The public is already skeptical about the need to conserve energy . A decision now to soften the miles-per-gallon requirement on the basis of inconclusive evidence would feed that skepticism . It is worth remembering , too , that if the auto companies do not meet the standard , they need not shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers ) a penalty of $50 per car for every mile per gallon they miss ? not an overwhelming amount . And if , finally , the rules really end up threatening Chrysler 's existence , Washington could legally waive the penalty . ? As for the period after 1985 , Secretary Adams is already calling for still more stringent mileage requirements . We accept that approach for the earlier period , but in the long run , taxes on gasoline and gas guzzlers are a better way to go . The Adams approach requires the Federal regulators to weigh the estimated cost of their mileage demands on the auto companies against their estimates of fuel savings . But such calculations are intrinsically uncertain , and the cost of error would be great . Why not get the Government out of the business of making calculations it can not make very well ? It would be far more efficient to impose new taxes which reflect the total cost ? including national security ? of using the imported stuff and let the industry and driving public decide how to adjust .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
