Within the next decade , Americans will be learning a new language in their kitchens , factories , automobiles and local bars . The metric system of weights and measures , already used in nearly every other country around the world , is being slowly adopted in the U.S. Although the switch is voluntary , Congress passed a law in December 1975 that encourages all Government agencies to change to metrics over the next few years . Since liquor , food , drugs , the interstate highway system and weather forecasts are regulated by the Federal Government , few areas of everyday life will remain untouched by the conversion . <P> Beginning in this week 's issue , TIME will try to help its readers learn the new metric language . All articles in the Science and Medicine sections will include measurements in both the International System ( metric ) and in standard English equivalents . <P> Most U.S. scientific and medical endeavors already use metrics , so the writers and reporter-researchers in the two sections are well prepared for the switch . Medicine Writer Frederic Golden has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transform figures from one system to the other . For those less well equipped-or well informed - confusion can create problems . Science Writer Peter Stoler recalls A Day 's Wait , a short story by Ernest Hemingway : " The hero is a small American boy who gets the flu . and the doctor measures his temperature at 102 . The child had gone to school in France , where he had been told that nobody could live with a temperature above 44 . So he believes he is going to die . " <P> Other less traumatic mix-ups are bound to arise as Americans trade in their historic furlongs , acres , bushels and pecks for the more rational , if less poetic meters , hectares and liters . Some conversions , though , will be learned more quickly than others : getting a traffic ticket for driving 50 miles per hour in a 50 kilometer-per-hour zone will probably help drivers adjust to the new system . And a few changes will be happy ones . Leon Jaroff , editor of the Science and Medicine sections , reminds us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read only 76 kilograms . That somehow makes it less disturbing . " <P> Certain terms , of course , may become quaint , but will always be irreplaceable . Pound cake will remain just that , no matter how many grams the ingredients weigh . A miss will never be as good as a kilometer ; no Texan is likely to wear a 38-liter hat . In some cases , neither form of measurement matters much . The day that hell freezes over , whether it happens in Celsius ( 0 ) or Fahrenheit ( 32 ) , it will still rate a TIME cover .
