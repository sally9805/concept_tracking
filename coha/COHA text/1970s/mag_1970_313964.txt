When Intrepid scored her startling victory over Valiant in last month 's America 's Cup trials , the least surprised man in Newport was Britton Chance Jr. , the young naval architect who had taken the old 1967 Cup winner and redesigned her into the 1970 Cup defender . To Chance 's mind , the outcome was decided last winter in a test tank in Hoboken , N.J. There , like some bathtub admiral , he spent four months testing 75 different model hulls until " I felt we had a winning design for Intrepid . ' " Chance was sure of it when he saw the first photograph of Valiant under sail . " I could tell from the shape of her wake that she was in trouble , " he says , and adds : " There was no turning point . We had it all season . " <P> If confidence is what it takes to defeat the Australian challenger Gretel II when the America 's Cup begins this week , Brit Chance obviously has enough to spare . Indeed , some old salts find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , but criticizing the boat 's designer . Olin Stephens , 62 , the man who practically invented the 12-meter sloop , is akin to lse-majest . But Chance is n't listening ; he is too busy explaining why Stephens , after designing three of the last four Cup winners , was all but swamped by the new Intrepid . " Olin works very slowly , " says Chance . " He gets in trouble with some aspects of his tank tests and ends up confused by the results . " <P> Space-Age Principles . Chance is an unabashed advocate of applying space-age principles to the ancient art of boat building . It is no accident that his chief engineer , Eric Hall , used to work for Grumman Corp. , the people who built the Apollo lunar module . Experimenting with tensile strengths and thermal coefficients . Chance refitted the old Intrepid with exotic lightweight metals - beryllium on the top of the mast , magnesium for the winches , boron graphite for the boom-to cut the weight of these vital fittings up to 65% . <P> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear ever carried on a sailboat , including a tape device that plots the boat 's course as well as a small computer that tells Skipper Bill Ficker his true speed toward the mark ( as opposed to speed through the water ) . Below the waterline , Chance installed a smaller keel and restyled the stern with a V-shaped bustle . Result : a remarkable 18% increase in Intrepid ' s theoretical speed .
