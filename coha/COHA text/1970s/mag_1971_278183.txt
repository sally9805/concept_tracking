" Three-quarters of all humanity runs around with ruined spines , " says Luigi Colani , a successful West German industrial designer . To help prevent any further proliferation of bad backs-at least among typists-Colani has invented the cradle-like device . In it , a secretary can sit upright , slump or practically recline while typing , without missing a key . " Every part of a typist , with the exception of her eyeballs and fingers , is supported , " says Colani . Installed in the contraption , a typist can lean against a contoured back and headrest , with elbows planted on concave platforms and wrists braced on two flexible supports just below the keyboard . Earphones provide music or can be connected to a dictating machine . Colani , who calls his device an " integrated mobile module , " spent three months and $20,000 developing it . But he is somewhat pessimistic about its future .
