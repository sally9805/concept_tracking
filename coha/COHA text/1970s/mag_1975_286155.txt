Coaches who had spent weeks working on game plans designed to destroy opening-day opponents were suddenly not sure what team to plot against . Television networks did not know if they would have games to televise . Bookies were beside themselves because the uncertainty was costing them big business . And millions of fans were steeling themselves for an autumn Sunday on which they might have to do something other than watch pro football . <P> Behind all the confusion last week was the sudden pro football players ' strike , the third in five years . Like the ineffectual walkouts of 1970 and 1974 , last week 's action began with high hopes and fizzled for lack of player support . It was a strike whose ingredients must boggle the minds of experienced union men : a divided membership , a union head bargaining in the face of a vote of no confidence , strike votes taken without members ' understanding what they were voting on , and a communications network that centered on one player 's kitchen phone . By the time the strike sagged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their fill of a puzzling dispute pitting greedy team owners against lavishly salaried athletes . <P> Rozelle Rule . The flare-up began when the New England Patriots voted to boycott the last game of their preseason schedule . The Patriots were not simply demanding a better contract ; they were trying to find out if the N.F.L. Players Association was a viable union . Since the failure of last year 's strike , the owners have felt no pressing need to bargain with the players ' group . " We 're tired of waiting for negotiations to progress , " announced Randy Vataha , Patriot wide receiver and player representative . " Let 's see if the owners are serious-and whether the players are serious . " <P> What Rebel Leader Vataha did not mention was a fistful of bread-and-butter grievances that were the underlying force in the walkout . The most celebrated is the controversial Rozelle rule , which restricts a player 's freedom to switch teams . At present , anyone who has completed his contractual obligations with one team can sell his services elsewhere , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with property ( player or draft choice ) of equal value . If the teams can not strike a bargain , N.F.L. Commissioner Pete Rozelle sets the terms himself , and the players claim he always exacts a high price to discourage the footloose . <P> The Rozelle rule is by no means the players ' only complaint . Indeed , many of them voted recently to oust Players Association Executive Director Ed Garvey because they felt he had lost last year 's strike by overstressing the Rozelle rule and other " freedom issues . " More important , particularly to veterans , are the league 's pension plan , insurance program and even the number of players allowed each team . Since the last contract expired in 1974 , for example , the league has not contributed to the players ' pension fund ; they have now missed payments totaling $5 million . The players also want teams to carry more than the presently permitted roster of 43 men , so that clubs do not play short-handed when there are injuries .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
