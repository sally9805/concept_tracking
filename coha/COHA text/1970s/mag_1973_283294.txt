IN its swift swings between lull and violence , hope and despair , the Viet Nam War has often had a manic character to it . Never more so than in the latest extraordinary episode in which , within the space of 40 days , the world moved from a sense of peace at last at hand , to the most brutal U.S. bombing of the war , to Washington 's declaration late last week that the secret Paris peace talks would begin again on Jan. 8 . Through Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Warren , President Nixon announced that he was halting the massive aerial punishment of North Viet Nam as suddenly-and with as little public explanation-as he had started it two weeks before . His spokesman said only that Nixon was acting because " it was clear that serious negotiations could be resumed . " <P> Rarely if ever before had a major power so openly used overwhelming force to extract concessions at the conference table , or moved so swiftly from diplomacy to war and back ; the episode almost evoked the end of the Thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in a dizzying blur . The news of the bombing halt was as puzzling as it was welcome . Nixon had broken off the peace talks in anger at what he regarded as Hanoi 's intransigence . He had sent the bombers north on a scale greater than any in the long war to force the North Vietnamese to bargain on his terms , and apparently it had worked-else why resume talking ? Yet it was difficult to imagine Hanoi so obviously knuckling under to the U.S. spasm of bombardment , and a North Vietnamese spokesman in Paris put a different face on the event , saying : " Our position has always been that if the U.S. wished to solve the problem through serious negotiations , it should cease the acts of escalation and renounce the threat of force . " <P> Those acts of escalation , embodied in daily waves of U.S. bombers aimed at Hanoi 's heartland over a period of two weeks , had left the capital of North Viet Nam a stricken city , rapidly emptying of people , without electricity and in some places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed and cratered by the ferocity of daily U.S. bombing raids . Once neat one-story houses lay flattened or lurched at odd angles , roofless and windowless . On one street , a young worker in a red helmet stared numbly into a pit that was once his home . In it lay children 's shattered copybooks , a dead black hen , and a mosquito net still hanging on one end from an upright beam . On another street , relief crews tugged at the corpse of a dead nurse , buried under her blasted dispensary . An old man stood amid the ruins of his home , mechanically putting on his coat and taking it off as though the simple ritual might restore his past . <P> Children searched among the debris looking for parents , parents for children . At the Bach Mai hospital , patients were trundled piggyback from the smoldering rubble as the director ran frantically from one victim to another . The Bach Thai hospital for tuberculous patients was razed . The railroad station had been destroyed , the Gia Lam airport runways pocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on a wall , someone scrawled , " Nixon , you will pay this blood debt " and " We will avenge our compatriots massacred by the Americans . "
