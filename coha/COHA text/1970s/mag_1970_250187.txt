West German businessmen have long been mighty figures in foreign markets , but nearly always as exporters . Now they are increasingly taking a new role - as owners of foreign factories . In the past two weeks , executives of Farbwerke Hoechst , a huge chemical manufacturer , have played the part with particular bravura in Britain and France . Climaxing a long contest , they outbid the U.S. 's Sherwin-Williams Co. to win a controlling interest in Berger , Jenson &; Nicholson Ltd. , a major British paint producer . In France , Hoechst executives encouraged a merger of two concerns , Roussel-Uclaf and Centrale de Dynamite , which together sell about $200 million worth of Pharmaceuticals a year - or almost as much as Rhone-Pou-lenc , the French pharmaceutical leader . Hoechst has ties to both concerns and will come out owning 20% to 25% of the merged company . <P> In 1968 , for the first time since World War II , German companies invested more money abroad ( $575 million ) than foreign firms put into enterprises in Germany ( $550 million ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mark increased the quantity of foreign plant , equipment and stock that German currency could buy . At the present rate of expansion , German business within a few years will own more plant abroad than foreign companies own in Germany . <P> The move overseas has been led by the highly advanced chemical industry , specifically by the three companies into which the victorious Allies shattered the old I. G. Farben cartel . The three are : Hoechst , Farbenfabriken Bayer , and Badische Anilin- &; Soda Fabrik . B.A.S.F. recently spent $95 million to buy out Michigan-based Wyandotte Chemicals Corp. , the biggest U.S. maker of urethane plastics ( 1968 sales : $147 million ) , and it is now putting up $100 million to expand a Wyandotte plant in Louisiana . The firm has also budgeted $200 million to $300 million to build a chemical complex of its own in South Carolina ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) . Farbenfabriken Bayer has earmarked $140 million to expand its facilities in the U.S. <P> Other companies are following the chemical makers ' lead . Siemens , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total more than $100 million . It is expanding plants in Europe , Australia and Canada . Volkswagen expects to enlarge an assembly plant in Brazil , and Daimler-Benz will put $68 million into Brazilian and Argentine auto plants during the next three years . <P> Wooed by Pennsylvania . Such ventures represent a recurrence of an old pattern . Early in this century , German industrialists built an immense network of foreign interests , but nearly all were seized during the two world wars . Twice burned , German businessmen were hesitant about reaching abroad again . German direct investment in the U.S. still lags behind the holdings of Britain , Canada , The Netherlands and even Switzerland . Lately the Germans have been hard-pressed to fill booming domestic and export orders and have shown a fresh interest in manufacturing overseas as a way to keep their foreign sales growing .
