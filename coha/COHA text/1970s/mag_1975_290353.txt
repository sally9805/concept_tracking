If the U.S. is to reduce its dependence on imported petroleum , more than conservation or even development of alternate sources of energy will be needed . The nation must also find new pools of oil at home and drain every possible drop from already known domestic reserves . That has not been happening , and some critics , including former Federal Power Commission Head Lee White and Ralph Nader , charge that the oil industry has had an incentive to drag its feet in order to reduce the supply and force prices still higher . The evidence scarcely supports that accusation : petroleum producers lately have been sinking more holes into American soil than at any time since the mid-1960s . Trouble is , the new wells are not turning up much oil . <P> Last year the number of wells drilled in the U.S. rose 15% above 1973 to 32,000 , but the nation produced 7% fewer barrels per day ( 8.4 million ) than the year before . In the first quarter of 1975 , 8,568 wells were drilled , 22% more than during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minuscule rise . Although increased drilling has added new oil to the nation 's supply , it has not done so fast enough to offset the drain on total proven reserves caused by pumping from old fields ( see chart ) . <P> Figures due out later this month are expected to show that the drilling rate slackened somewhat during the second quarter , though it remained ahead of 1974 . One reason is that oil companies have less money to spend : Congress has eliminated most of their depletion allowance , and their profits have dropped . Exxon , for example , reported a 34.3% decline in net from the second quarter , compared with 1974 . But another reason is the discouragingly low rate of discovery . Says Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Executive Director John Lichtblau : " The plain truth is , we just have n't seen any results from the recent rapid pace of drilling . " <P> It may well be that there is just not much oil left to be found in the continental U.S. , at least not in amounts large enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , of course , but experts are beginning to wonder . The U.S. Geological Survey recently cut in half its estimate of recoverable oil left in the U.S. , to 82 billion bbl . Oil Expert Walter Levy questions whether it makes much sense for oil companies to continue " spending more and more , and finding less and less . " Wildcatters will no doubt continue exploring vigorously , but they have accounted for barely half of what little new oil has been found since 1973 , and their discoveries are unlikely to have a major impact on the nation 's total supply during the next few years . The major producers , meanwhile , seem almost certain to drill less aggressively in areas where they believe only modest quantities can be found . Says Exxon Executive Vice President W.T. Slick Jr. : " We do n't find it economical to drill in isolated locations or for small amounts of oil . "
