As the election season begins , the President projects a tougher image <P> Lawns turning green . Flowers blooming . Daylight Saving Time returning . To 34 U.S. Senators , 435 members of the House and 35 Governors , these are not just signs of mid-Spring but reminders that the season for hard campaigning is again at hand . Indeed , from now until early October the nation 's primary elections are occurring almost weekly . For many politicians , this is a time of great apprehension , when an answer to the big question is no longer to be delayed : Can they keep their jobs ? <P> From a vastly different perspective , this is also a critical time for Jimmy Carter . The off-year elections often turn into a referendum of sorts on the performance of the man in the Oval Office , and Carter is heading into the political season in poor shape for the battle . A Louis Harris poll last week showed that his public-approval rating had fallen to 33%-worse than the lowest figures of Presidents Kennedy , Johnson and Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low . <P> In part to check these dismal figures , Carter last week embarked on a campaign to seize some of the election-year clout that normally resides in the presidency . At a press conference , he forcefully refused to retreat from two legislative positions that are highly unpopular on Capitol Hill . <P> First , he insisted that his plans to sell advanced fighter aircraft to Israel , Saudi Arabia and Egypt were an inseparable package . Said he : " If the Congress should accept a portion and reject another , then my intent is to withdraw the sales proposal altogether . " The strong stand riled congressional leaders , who felt they were being forced into a corner . At week 's end Secretary of State Cyrus Vance soothed their feelings by promising that the Administration would no longer call the sale a " package " but would still press ahead with its plans to sell planes to all three countries ( see WORLD ) . <P> Second , Carter adamantly rejected advice from congressional leaders that he postpone trying to reform taxes and seek only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of highly qualified , very intelligent , very effective lobbyists trying to induce the members of Congress to preserve special privileges for people who are so powerful and so influential . " <P> The effort to create a more " presidential " image as a decisive leader stems from Carter 's Camp David conference two weeks ago with top aides at which he frankly conceded that he had too often appeared " fuzzy . " As one example , he cited the $50-per-person tax-rebate plan that he proposed last year and then abandoned in the face of widespread congressional opposition . Carter has apparently decided that if his programs are going to get battered in Congress anyway , he will look stronger politically if he goes down fighting . <P> On Capitol Hill , however , there was fear that he was heading for a clash with Congress that will neither help his programs nor prove politically popular . Said a House leader : " Congress is led by Democrats who want to see the President succeed . But he 's a hard man to help . " Agreed another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a little diplomacy , a collision can be avoided . "
