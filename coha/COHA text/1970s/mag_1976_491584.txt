Filet mignon , veal scallopini and stand  --  ing rib roast are possible on a budget . How , you want to know ? Since most neighborhoods ' zoning laws do n't permit raising cattle in your backyard and land  --  lords usually frown on four-ton pets , there is only one way to tackle the prob  --  lem : Do your own butchering ! I am not talking about attacking a whole side of beef on your own . That 's a job for a pro and there is so much waste besides , it 's hardly worth the effort . In  --  stead , watch for meat sales and act ac  --  cordingly . Thus , from one standing rib roast you are able to create short ribs for two to three people , a boneless pot- or oven-roast to serve four and a gorgeous rib roast for six to eight  --  all for a lot less than you would pay for the cuts purchased separately . To get your money 's worth , there are some facts you should know about beef , veal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your belt , you 'll find that the " do-it-yourself-syndrome " we all have been pushed into lately can be a lot . of fun after all ! If you study the meat chart ( although we are using a beef chart , these rules apply to lamb , pork , and veal , which are cut about the same way ) , you will see that carcasses are divided into eight primal cuts that go to the butcher or supermarket . Most retail cuts refer to the primal cut in their titles , e.g. , chuck roasts , loin chops , etc . The best way to remember meat cuts is to get down on all fours with the chart in front of you . It 's easy to remember where the round is if you recall where yours is . I do not suggest you do this until your fam  --  ily is out of the house . To the unin ? formed , your sanity may be suspect . There are two things to understand when you are looking for tender meat . First , where the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoul  --  der , leg , hip joint ) , the meat is tougher . Where there is little or no movement ( ribs , loin or sirloin ) , the meat is tender . Tender cuts are generally from the center of the animal . Second , when looking at meat at the supermarket or butcher shop , remem  --  ber flat bones indicate tender meats and round bones ( joints and legs ) indicate tougher cuts . BEEF  --  There are two grades of beef widely available to the consumer : prime If you 're afraid they 'll cut up , corral the rest of the family in another room while you hunker down on all fours to better understand this dia  --  gram of the eight primal meat portions . and choice . Prime meat has an evenly dis  --  tributed marbling of fat through the meat . It should look like pencil streaks , not chunks of fat . Choice grade has slightly sparser marbling but it too should be evenly distributed throughout the meat . The fat on either grade should be creamy white , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones red or pinkish . If fat is yellow and meat is dark red , the steer is probably an old one and meat will be tough and fatty . Something that one constantly hears in the butcher shop is a customer asking for a " juicy , tender , lean steak . " That 's like asking for a low-calorie hot fudge sundae . You ca n't have both . What makes meat tender is a good amount of marbling which melts in cooking to moisten the cut . Lean meats lend themselves to very interesting preparation . They can be mari ? nated and then roasted or broiled , braised ( cooked with just a little liquid ) , stewed ( cooked with a lot of liquid ) or boiled . The marination breaks down tissue , there  --  by compensating for the lack of marbling . The moist cooking methods add the moisture missing in the marbling . LAMB is graded the same way beef is . Since it is a much younger animal , mar  --  bling is not as noticeable . There is a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market between March and October when the animal has been pastured . The meat is a bright pinkish red , bones are pink and there is no " muttony " aroma . The untrimmed leg ( with shank bone and chops ) weighs no more than about seven pounds . Larger lambs are pro  --  duced through the winter and fed on grains . They are not as delicate in flavor , meat is a rich , dark red ; bones are red and sometimes there is a " muttony " odor . The leg will be as large as nine to ten pounds . This is good meat but should be treated differently from the younger cuts . VEAL  --  Fine ( milk-fed ) veal is from ani  --  mals two to three months old . It is very difficult to find . This meat is white-pink , fat is white and bones are deep pink to red . There is a moist , velvety look to the meat . Your best bet in obtaining fine veal is to locate an Italian butcher in your area . More readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal about three to four months old that has had some solid food . The meat will range from pink to light red but the fat should still be white . If the fat is tinged with yellow , the animal is in the Never-Never Land of not being young enough to be delicate and not old enough to have a rich , beefy flavor . Be  --  cause veal is so young , it does not have enough fat to broil well . Saute , roast , braise or stew . PORK  --  Look for the same coloring as veal . The meat should have marbling like beef steaks . Dark colored meat indicates an older animal . It will not be as tender and has more waste . Pork producers are giving the public a much leaner meat than we had ten years ago . This makes for less waste and better eating . Studies have proven that the trich  --  inosis-causing parasites are destroyed when the meat reaches an internal temper  --  ature of 137 degrees . So if you cook pork until your meat thermometer registers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is perfectly safe . Older cooking methods calling for 185 degrees usually make for dry , tasteless dinners . One other thing  --  pork has as much cholesterol as lean beef . There are many cuts that are a com  --  bination of two or three types of meat . For instance , in a porterhouse steak there is a filet mignon , a shell steak and some stew meat . When you buy these pieces individually , you pay top price for the additional labor . Now if you do the labor ( usually just a few minutes ' worth ) , you end up with the best of both worlds : sav  --  ings and better meat on your table . Al  --  ways save bones for the soup pot and scraps of meat for grinding . You 'll need some basic equipment : a small paring knife , a large chopping knife , an inexpensive hacksaw ( from the hard  --  ware store at about $2.50 ) and a ball of cotton string  --  heat will melt nylon . Be sure the knives are sharp and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a scale and a boning knife would help but are not necessary . STANDING RIB  --  The piece that is usu  --  ally on sale is a cut of rib closer to the If you missed playing marbles as a child , now 's the time to start . Quality meats are known by their marbling . Preparation requires a paring knife , a chopping knife , a hacksaw and a ball of cotton string . You can dispense with the striped apron . chuck than the prime rib . By the way , prime in this case means the first four ribs from the short loin ; it has nothing to do with the grade of the meat . If you study the chuck end cut of rib , you will see there are two sections of meat separated by a layer of fat . The top layer is not as well marbled or grained as the center part of the meat . This top cut makes excellent pot roast , ground beef or a slightly chewy oven roast . All you have to do is separate the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the top of the roast ( save the fat , you 'll need it in a few minutes ) . Now insert your small knife just above that center layer of fat and cut away the top portion of meat ( see photo above ) . Roll it , fat side out , like a jelly roll and tie it with cotton string . You now have a two- to three-pound roast that will serve four to six people . Press the leftover fat over the top of the rib roast to avoid loss of juices while cooking . Tie the roast in three or four places and you 're ready to go . This six- to seven-pound roast will serve six to eight people . If you like rib steak ( one of my favorite steaks ) , just insert your small knife be  --  tween the rib bone and the meat and cut . Keep cutting with one side of the knife always against the bone until you have freed all the meat . Now with your large knife cut the piece into one-inch-thick steaks . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut two to four steaks , then roll and tie the remainder of the meat for a boneless rib roast . All this from a 12- to 13-pound sale rib roast . NOTE . This same technique can be used on the rib end of a loin of pork to make boneless cutlets . LEG OF VEAL , shank end ( five to seven poundsl , is sometimes on sale in supermarkets . You could roast it whole to feed about eight people . Try instead mak  --  ing one small roast and about three pounds of veal scallopini . The scallopini alone makes the work worthwhile . To make the meat firm enough to cut , place it in the freezer for about a half hour . With your large knife , cut into the meat about eight inches from the shank ( nar  --  row end ) . When you hit bone , saw through it with the hacksaw . You now have a small shank roast ( also good for kebabs ) . The chunk you have left is where the scallopini comes from . Place the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more meat on one side of the bone than on the other . With your large knife cut the larger chunk of meat away from the bone . It will look like a half cylinder . The meat that remains on the bone can be added to the roast or ground . Freeze the large chunk about a half hour . Then cut it into very thin slices across the grain . If you wish veal steaks , cut into inch-thick slices . LEG OF LAMB is very similar in con  --  formation to the veal except that usually some of the loin and pelvic area is in  --  cluded . You can saw through the loin end to make two or three loin chops . Use a nine-pound leg for this project . Saw through the shank end as in the leg of veal . This meat is not as tender as the center of the leg and is excellent for brais  --  ing or lambburgers . The center of the leg may be boned by cutting the meat away from the hone with your small knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bone . You could stuff the center of the leg or roll the piece and tie it . What I particularly like about this cut is the ease in carving it at the table . If you like lamb steaks , just cut the boned or unboned center leg into steaks . NOTE : The same principles apply to fresh hams . Most people do n't realize that this is the most delicious cut of pork . BREAST OF VEAL usually turns into one of our favorite company dishes and.a " finger-lickin ' good " family meal . A four-to five-pound veal breast will give you a rolled veal roast to serve four to five , and veal spareribs for two . Lay the breast bone side down . With your small knife begin to cut the meat from the bone on the side of the breast where the bones are thickest . Just keep easing the meat back and running the knife along the bone . The meat will come off in one piece . With your hacksaw or large knife separate the bones . The meat may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the ribs can be marinated Chinese style and broiled . For spareribs to feed four , do n't bone the breast . Cut the bones apart and marinate . The boned meat is also good for stew . PORTERHOUSE STEAK is a luxury for most of us . If I told you that from a pair of two-inch-thick porterhouses you could get four filets mignons , four shell steaks and about two pounds of stew meat , would you be convinced I 'd lost my mind ? Well , I 'll be eating steak all the way to the asylum . If you lay the steak down so that the tail trails off to your left , you 'll see a small oval of meat to the left of the long center bone . That is the filet mignon . Trim it away from the bone and remove surrounding fat . To the right of the center bone is a larger triangle of meat . This is the shell steak and all you have to do is cut it away from the bone . Leave a thin layer of fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same quality as the first two pieces but is excellent for brais  --  ing , stewing or grinding . Repeat the process with the second steak and then place the filets and shells in the freezer long enough to firm them up . With your large knife halve each piece lengthwise . There are your eight steaks . We 've barely scratched the sur  --  face . With some imagination and your trusty knife , you can cut your way through the entire meat depart  --  ment at a profit . One Thursday morning about ten years ago I purchased a prime , aged , very expensive roast ( even in those days this meant taking out a bank loan ) for a special Saturday night dinner party . After wrapping it air  --  tight in foil , I plopped it into the refrigerator . Late Saturday after  --  noon I unwrapped it and wasalmost knocked over by a horrendous smell . The roast and the dinner party were ruined . My butcher heard about it in rather graphic terms . When I calmed down , he explained what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd formed an incubator for spoilage . Always wrap meat loosely so that air can circulate around it . This keeps bac  --  teria from forming on the meat . It will keep for about three days in the coldest part of your refrigerator . The opposite is true for freezing . Use heavy , airtight wrapping and always label and date the meat . If your freezer does not go below zero , keep meat only about two weeks . Tougher cuts of meat have freezer priority , as freezing causes the break  --  down of tissue and loss of moisture . Always thaw meats in the refrigera  --  tor or you 'll have that bacteria prob  --  lem to deal with all over again . By the way , my kind-hearted butcher sent over some lovely chops as a " **26;3814;TOOLONG  --  sure " present . Another plus in my book for dealing with a reliable meat man . Cashing in is more than half the fun . No one will believe this is bud  --  get food .
