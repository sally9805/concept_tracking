 | the induction under anesthesia had to be all completed before 7:30 . As a consequence , at 7:11 , the activity in the OR area was in full swing , including room number 8 . There was nothing special about No. 8 . It was a typical OR in the Memorial . The walls were a neutralcolored tile ; the floors were a speckled vinyl . At 7:30 , February 14 , 1976 , a D &C; dilation and curettage , a routine gynecological procedure was scheduled in room No. 8 . The patient was Nancy Greenly ; the anesthesiologist was Dr. Robert Billing , a second-year anesthesiology resident ; the scrub nurse was Ruth Jenkins ; the circulating nurse was Gloria D'Mateo . The surgeon was George Major the new , young partner of one of the older , established OBGYN men and he was in the dressing room donning his surgical scrub suit , while the others were hard at work . Nancy Greenly had been bleeding for eleven days . At first she passed it off as a normal period , despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no premenstrual discomfort , maybe a vague cramp on the morning the first spotting occurred . But after that it had been a painless affair , waxing and waning . Each night she hoped to have seen the last of it but had awakened to find the tampon soaked . The telephone conversations , first with Dr. Major 's nurse , then with the doctor himself , had allayed her fears for progressively shorter and shorter durations . And it was a bother , a gigantic nuisance , and as it was with such things , it had come at a most inopportune time . She thought about Kim Devereau coming up to spend his spring break from Duke Law School with her in Boston . Her roommate had fortuitously made plans to spend that week skiing at Killington . Everything seemed to have been falling into beautiful , romantic place , everything except the bleeding . There was no way Nancy could blithely dismiss it . She was a delicately angular and attractive girl with an aristocratic appearance . About her person she was fastidious . If her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued bleeding made her feel messy , unattractive , out of control . Eventually it began to frighten her . Nancy remembered lying on the couch with her feet up on the arm , reading the editorial page of the Globe while Kim was in the kitchen making drinks . She had become aware of a strange sensation in her vagina . It was different from anything she had ever felt before . It felt 4  | as if she was being inflated by a warm soft mass . There had been absolutely no pain or discomfort . At first she was perplexed as to the origin of the sensation , but then she felt a warmth on her inner thighs and a tickling trickle of fluid run down into the recess of her buttocks . Without undue anxiety , she recognized that she was bleeding , bleeding very fast . Casually , without moving her body , she had turned her head toward the kitchen and called out , " Kim , would you do me a favor and call an ambulance ? " " What 's wrong ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding very fast , " said Nancy calmly , " but it 's nothing to get alarmed about . An extra-heavy period , I guess . I just should go to the hospital right away . So please call the ambulance . " The ambulance ride had been uneventful , without sirens or drama . She had to wait longer than she thought reasonable in the holding area of the emergency room . Dr. Major had appeared and for the first time awakened a feeling of gladness in Nancy . She had always detested the routine vaginal exams to which she had submitted and had associated the face , the bearing , and the smell of Dr. Major with them . But when he appeared in the emergency room , she felt glad to see him , to the point of suppressing tears . The vaginal examination in the emergency room had been , without doubt , the worst she had ever experienced . A flimsy curtain , which was constantly being whisked back and forth , was the sole barrier between the throng in the emergency room and Nancy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; blood was drawn ; she had to change from her clothes into the hospital gown ; and each time something was done the curtain flashed aside and Nancy was confronted with an array of faces in white clothes , children with cuts , and old , tired people . And there was the bedpan sitting there right in the open for everyone to gape at . It contained a large , semiformed dark red blood clot . Meanwhile Dr. Major was down there between her legs touching her and talking to the nurse about another case . Nancy closed her eyes as tightly as she could and cried silently . But it was all to be over shortly , or so Dr. Major had promised . In great detail he had told Nancy about the lining of her uterus and how it changes during the normal cycle and what happens when it does n't  | change . There was something about the blood vessels and the need for an egg to be released from the ovary . The definitive cure was a dilation and curettage . Nancy had agreed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could do that herself after the fact . She was sure her mother would think she had had to have an abortion . Now , as Nancy gazed up at the large overhead operating room light , the only thought that made her the slightest bit happy was the fact that the whole goddamned nightmare was going to be over within the hour , and her life would return to normal . The activity in the operating room was so totally foreign to her that she avoided looking at anyone or anything , save for the light above . " Are you comfortable ? " Nancy glanced to the right . Deep brown eyes regarded her from between the synthetic fibers of the surgical hood . Gloria D'Mateo was folding the draw sheet around Nancy 's right arm , securing it to her side and immobilizing her further . " Yes , " answered Nancy with a certain detachment . Actually she was as uncomfortable as hell . The operating table was as hard as her cheap Formica kitchen table . But the Phenergan and Demerol she had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her cerebrum . Nancy was far more awake than she would have liked ; but at the same time she was beginning to feel a detachment and dissociation from her surroundings . The atrophine she had been given was having an effect as well , making her throat and mouth feel dry and her tongue sticky . Dr. Robert Billing was engrossed with his machine . It was a tangle of stainless steel , upright manometers , and a few colorful cylinders of compressed gas . A brown bottle of halothane stood on top of the machine . On the label was written : " **38;647;TOOLONG ( CZHBrCIF3 ) . " An almost perfect anesthetic agent . " Almost " because every so often it seemed to destroy the patient 's liver . But that rarely happened , and halothane 's other characteristics far overshadowed the potential for liver damage . Dr. Billing was crazy about the stuff . Somewhere in his imagination he pictured himself developing halothane , introducing it to the medical community in the lead article of the New England Journal of Medicine , and then walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuxedo he had worn when he was married . Dr. Billing was a damned good anesthesiology resident , and he knew it . In fact , he thought most everyone knew it . He was convinced he knew as much anesthesiology as most of the attendings , more than some . And he was careful , very careful . He had had no serious complications as a resident , and that was indeed rare . Like a 747 pilot , he had made himself a checklist , and religiously he adhered to a policy of checking off each step of the induction procedure . This meant having Xeroxed off a thousand of the checklists and bringing a copy along with the other equipment at the start of each operation . By 7:15 , the anesthesiologist was right on schedule at step number 12 : that meant hooking up the rubber scubalike tubing to the machine . One end went into the ventilating bag , whose four- to five-liter capacity afforded him an opportunity to inflate forcibly the patient 's lungs at any time during the procedure . The other end went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon dioxide would be absorbed . Step number 13 on his list was to make sure the unidirectional check valves in the breathing lines were lined up in the right direction . Step number 14 was to connect the anesthesia machine to the compressed air , nitrous oxide , and oxygen sources on the wall of the OR room . The anesthesia machine had emergency oxygen cylinders hanging from the side , and Dr. Billing checked the gauge pressures on both cylinders . They were fully charged . Dr. Billing felt fine . " I 'm going to place some electrodes on your chest so we can monitor your heart , " said Gloria D'Mateo while pulling down the sheet and pulling up the hospital gown , exposing Nancy 's midriff to the sterile air . The gown just barely covered Nancy 's nipples . " This will feel cold for a sec , " added Gloria D'Mateo as she squeezed a bit of colorless jelly onto three locations on Nancy 's exposed lower chest . Nancy wanted to say something , but she could n't deal rapidly enough with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful , because it was going to help her , or so she had been assured ; she was furious because she felt so exposed , literally and figuratively. 7  | " You 're going to feel a little stick now , " said Dr. Billing , slapping the back of Nancy 's left hand to make the veins stand out . He had placed a piece of rubber tubing tightly around Nancy 's wrist , and she could feel her heart beat in the tips of her fingers . It was all happening too fast for Nancy to assimilate . " Good morning , Miss Greenly , " said an ebullient Dr. Major as he whisked through the OR door . " I hope you had a good night 's sleep . We 'll get this affair over with in a few minutes and have you back to your bed for a restful sleep . " Before Nancy could respond , the nerves from the tissues on the back of her hand became alive with urgent messages for her pain center . After the initial thrust , the intensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The snug rubber tourniquet disappeared , and blood surged into Nancy 's hand . She felt tears well up from within her head . " I.V. , " said Dr. Billing to no one , as he made a black check next to number 16 on his list . " You 'll be going to sleep shortly , Nancy , " continued Dr. Major . " Is n't that right , Dr. Billing ? Nancy , you 're a lucky girl today . Dr. Billing is number one . " Dr. Major called all his patients girls no matter what age they were . It was one of those condescending mannerisms he had adopted unquestioningly from his older partner . " That 's correct , " said Dr. Billing , placing a rubber face mask on the anesthesia tubing . " Number eight tube , Gloria , please . And you , Dr. Major , can scrub ; we 'll be ready at seven-thirty sharp . " " OK , " said Dr. Major , heading for the door . Pausing , he turned to Ruth Jenkins , who was setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own dilators and curettes , Ruth . Last time you gave me that medieval rubbish that belongs to the house . " He was gone before the nurse could answer . Somewhere behind her , Nancy could hear the sonarlike beep of the cardiac monitor . It was her own heart rhythm resounding in the room . " All right , Nancy , " said Gloria . " I want you to slide down the table a bit and put your legs up here in the stirrups . " Gloria grasped Nancy 's legs in turn under the knees and lifted them up into the stainless steel stirrups . The sheet slid between Nancy 's legs , exposing them from mid-thigh down . The lower part of the table fell away , and  | the sheet slid to the floor . Nancy closed her eyes and tried not to picture herself spread-eagled on the table . Gloria picked up the sheet and haphazardly put it on Nancy 's abdomen so that it draped between her legs , covering her bloodied and recently shaved perineum . Nancy wanted to be calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to be grateful , but the tide was swinging more and more in the direction of undirected anger and emotion . " I 'm not sure I want to go through with this , " said Nancy , looking at Dr. Billing . " Everything is just fine , " said Dr. Billing in an artificially concerned tone of voice , while checking off number 18 on his list . " You 'll be asleep in a jiffy , " he added , while holding up a syringe and tapping it so that the bubbles all fled upward to the room air . " I 'm going to give you some Pentothal right away . Do n't you feel sleepy now ? " " No , " said Nancy . " Well , you should have told me , " said Dr. Billing . " I do n't know how I 'm supposed to feel , " returned Nancy . " It 's all right now , " said Dr. Billing , pulling his anesthesia machine close to Nancy 's head . With well-rehearsed adeptness , he attached his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . " Now I want you to count to fifty for me , Nancy . " He expected that Nancy would never get past fifteen . In fact , it gave Dr. Billing a certain sense of satisfaction to watch the patient go to sleep . It represented repetitive proof for him of the validity of the scientific method . Besides , it made him feel powerful ; it was as if he had command of the patient 's brain . Nancy was a strong-willed individual , however , and although she wanted to go to sleep , her brain involuntarily fought against the drug . She was still audibly counting when Dr. Billing gave an additional dose of Pentothal . She said twenty-seven before the two grams of the drug succeeded in inducing sleep . Nancy Greenly fell asleep at 7:24 on February 14 , 1976 , for the last time . Dr. Billing had no idea this healthy young woman was going to be his first major complication . He was confident that everything was under control . The list was almost complete . He had Nancy breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a mask . Then he injected 2 cc 's of a 0.2 percent succinylcholine chloride solution into Nancy 's I.V . to effect a paralysis of all her skeletal muscles . This 9  | would make the placement of the endotracheal tube in the trachea easier . It would also allow Dr. Major to perform a bimanual exam , to rule out ovarian pathology . The effect of the succinylcholine was seen almost immediately . At first there were minute fasciculations of the muscles of the face , then the abdomen . As the bloodstream sped the drug throughout the body , the motor and end plates of the muscles became depolarized , and total paralysis of the skeletal muscles occurred . Smooth muscles , like the heart , were unaffected , and the beep from the monitor continued without a waver . Nancy 's tongue was paralyzed and it fell back , blocking her airway . But that did n't matter . The muscles of the thorax and abdomen were paralyzed as well , and any attempt at breathing ceased . Although chemically different from the curare of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nancy would have died in five minutes . But at this point nothing was wrong . Dr. Billing was in total control . The effect was expected and desirable . Outwardly calm , inwardly very tense , Dr. Billing put down the breathing mask and reached for the laryngoscope , step number 22 on his list . With the tip of the blade , he pulled the tongue forward and maneuvered past the white epiglottis , while he visualized the entrance to the trachea . The vocal cords were ajar , paralyzed with the rest of the skeletal muscles . Swiftly Dr. Billing squirted some topical anesthetic into the trachea , followed by the endotracheal tube . The laryngoscope made a characteristic metallic snap as Dr. Billing folded the blade onto the handle . With the help of a small syringe , he inflated the cuff on the endotracheal tube , providing a seal . Quickly he attached the tip of the rubber hose , without the face mask , to the open end of the endotracheal tube . As he compressed the ventilating bag , Nancy 's chest rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chest with his stethoscope and was pleased . The entubation had been as characteristically smooth as expected . He was in total control of the patient 's respiratory state . I-le adjusted his flow meters and set the combination of halothane , nitrous oxide , and oxygen he wanted . A few pieces of tape secured the endotracheal tube . A twist of the finger  | adjusted the I.V . rate . Dr. Billing 's own heart began to slow down . He never showed it , but he always got very tense during the entubation procedure . With the patient paralyzed one has to work fast , and do it right . With a nod , Dr. Billing indicated that Gloria D'Mateo could begin the prep of Nancy 's shaved perineum . Meanwhile Dr. Billing began to make himself comfortable for the case . His job was now reduced to close observation of the patient 's vital signs : heart rate and rhythm , blood pressure , and temperature . As long as the patient was paralyzed , he had to compress the ventilating bag , to breathe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes ; then the patient could breathe herself , and the anesthesiologist could relax . Nancy 's blood pressure stayed at 105/70 . The pulse had steadily fallen from the anxiety state prior to anesthesia to a comfortable seventy-two beats per minute . Dr. Billing was happy , and he looked forward to a coffee break in about forty minutes . The case went smoothly . Dr. Major did his bimanual examination and asked for some more relaxation . This meant that Nancy 's blood had detoxified the succinylcholine given during the entubation . Dr. Billing was happy to give another 2 cc . He dutifully recorded this in his anesthesia record . The result was immediate , and Dr. Major thanked Dr. Billing and informed the crew that the ovaries felt like little smooth , normal plums . He always said that when he felt normal ovaries . The dilation of the cervix went without a hitch . Nancy had a normally antero-flexed uterus , and the curve on the dilators was a perfect match . A few blood clots were sucked out from the vaginal vault with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uterus , noting the consistency of the endometrial tissue . As Dr. Major passed the second curette , Dr. Billing noted a slight change in the rhythm of the cardiac monitor . He watched the electronic blip trace across the oscilloscope screen . The pulse fell to about sixty . Instinctively he inflated the blood pressure cuff and listened intently for the familiar far-away deep sound of the blood surging through the collapsed artery . As the air pressure drained off more , he heard the rebound sound indicating the diastolic pressure . The blood pressure was 90/60 . This was not terribly low , but it puzzled his analytical 11  | brain . Could Nancy be getting some vagal feedback from her uterus , he wondered . He doubted it , but just the same he took the stethoscope from his ears . " Dr. Major , could you hold on for just a minute ? The blood pressure has sagged a little . How much blood loss do you estimate ? " " Could n't be more than 500 cc , " said Dr. Major , looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. Billing , replacing the stethoscope in his ears . He inflated the cuff again . Blood pressure was 90/58 . He looked at the monitor : pulse sixty . " What 's the pressure ? " asked Dr. Major . " Ninety over sixty , with a pulse of sixty , " said Dr. Billing , taking the stethoscope from his ears and rechecking the flow valves on the anesthesia machine . " What the hell 's wrong with that , for Christ 's sake ? " snapped Dr. Major , showing some early surgical irritation . " Nothing , " agreed Dr. Billing , " but it 's a change . She had been so steady . " " Well , her color is fantastic . Down here , she 's as red as a cherry , " said Dr. Major , laughing at his own joke . No one else laughed . Dr. Billing looked at the clock . It was 7:48 . " OK , go ahead . I 'll tell you if she changes any more , " said Dr. Billing , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lungs maximally . Something was bothering Dr. Billing ; something was keying-off his sixth sense , activating his adrenals and pushing up his own heart rate . He watched the breathing bag sag and remain still . He compressed it again , mentally recording the degree of resistance afforded by Nancy 's bronchial tubes and lungs . She was very easy to breathe . He watched the bag again . No motion , no respiratory effect on Nancy 's part , despite the fact that the second dose of the succinylcholine should have been metabolized by then . The blood pressure came up slightly , then went down again : 80/58 . The monotonous beep of the monitor skipped once . Dr. Billing 's eyes shot to the oscilloscope screen . The rhythm picked up again . " I 'll be finished here in five minutes , " said Dr. Major for Dr. Billing 's benefit . With a sense of relief , Dr. Billing reached over and turned down both the nitrous oxide and the halothane flow , while  | turning up the oxygen . He wanted to lighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 90/60 , and Dr. Billing felt a little better . He even allowed himself the luxury of running the back of his hand across his forehead to scatter the beads of perspiration that had appeared as evidence of his increasing anxiety . He glanced at the soda-lime CO2 absorber . It appeared normal . Time was 7:56 . With his right hand he reached up and lifted Nancy 's eyelids . They moved with no resistance and the pupils were maximally dilated . The fear returned to Dr. Billing in a rush . Something was wrong . . . something was very wrong . Monday February 23 7:15 A.M. Several small flakes of snow danced down Longwood Avenue in the half-light of February 23 , 1976 . The temperature was a crisp twenty degrees and the delicate crystalline structures fluttering earthward were intact even after striking the pavement . The sun was obscured by a low cover of thick gray clouds which shrouded the waking city . More and more clouds were swept in by the sea breeze , enveloping the tops of the taller buildings in a mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frail fingers over Boston . It was not supposed to snow , yet a few flakes had crystallized over Cohasset and had blown all the way into the city . The few that reached Longwood Avenue and were blown right on Avenue Louis Pasteur were the survivors until a sudden down-draft slammed them against a third-story window of the medical school dorm . They would have slid off had it not been for the layer of greasy Boston grime on the pane . Instead they stuck there while the glass slowly transmitted the heat from within , and their delicate bodies dissolved and mingled with the dirt . Within her room Susan Wheeler was totally unaware of the drama on the window pane . Her mind was preoccupied with extracting itself 13  | from the clutches of a meaningless , disturbing dream after a restless , near-sleepless night . February 23 was going to be a difficult day at best and possibly a disaster . Medical school is made up of a thousand minor crises occasionally interrupted by truly epochal upheavals . February 23 was in the latter category for Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years of medical school , the basic science part taught in the lecture halls and science labs with books and other inanimate objects . Susan ' Wheeler had done very well because she could handle the classroom , the lab , and the papers . Her class notes were renowned and people always wanted to borrow them . At first she lent them indiscriminately . Later , as she began to perceive the realities of the competitive system which she thought she had left behind in Radcliffe , she changed her tactics . She lent her notes only to a small group of people who were her friends , or at least were people from whom she could borrow notes if she had had to miss a class . But she rarely missed a class . A number of people chided Susan playfully about her marvelous attendance record . She always responded by saying she needed all the help she could get . Of course that was not the reason . Having entered a profession dominated by males , in which essentially all the professors and instructors were males , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the fact that Susan looked on her mentors in a neutral sexless way as her professional superiors , they did not return the view in kind . The fact of the matter was that Susan Wheeler was a very attractive twenty-three-year-old female . Her hair was the color of winter wheat and very wispy . Since it was long and fine it drove her batty in the wind unless she had it pulled back and clasped with a barrette at the back of her head . From there it fell in a sheen to the lower edges of her shoulder blades . Her face was broad with high cheekbones , and her eyes , set well back in their sockets , were a mixture of blue and green with flecks of brown so that the chromatic effect changed with different light sources . Her teeth were ultra white and perfectly straight , the result of fifty percent nature and fifty percent suburbanite orthodontist . All in all Susan Wheeler appeared like the girl of the Pepsi-Cola people 's dreams . At twenty-three years old she was young , healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made eyes turn and hypothalamuses awaken . And on top of it all , perhaps in spite of it all , Susan Wheeler was very sharp . Her grammar school IQ ratings had hovered around the 140 range and were a source of infinite delight to her socially committed parents . Her school record was a monotonous series of A 's with numerous other evidences of achievement . Susan liked school and learning and reveled in using her brain . She read voraciously . Radcliffe had been perfect for her . She did well but she earned her grades . She had majored in chemistry but had taken as much literature as possible . She had no trouble getting into medical school . But being attractive as Susan was had certain definite drawbacks . One was the difficulty of missing class without being noticed . Whenever questions were asked , she was among those unfortunate few who served to demonstrate the stupidity of the students or the brilliance of the professors . Another drawback was that people formed opinions about Susan , with very little information . She so resembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those frequently mindless girls . There were advantages , though , to being bright and beautiful , and Susan was slowly beginning to realize that it was reasonable to exploit them to a degree . If she needed a further explanation regarding some complicated topic , she only had to ask once . Instructors and professors alike would hasten to help Susan understand a fine point of endocrinology or a subtle point of anatomy . Socially , Susan did not date as much as people imagined she would . The explanation for this paradox was severalfold . First , Susan preferred reading in her room to a boring date , . and with her intelligence , Susan found quite a few men boring . Second , few men actually asked Susan out , just because Susan 's combination of beauty and brains was a bit intimidating . Susan spent many Saturday nights engrossed in novels , some literary , some otherwise . Starting February 23 , Susan feared her comfortable world was going to be blown up . The familiar lecture routine was over . Susan Wheeler and one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security of the inanimate and tossed 15  | into the arena of the clinical years . All the confidence in one 's abilities formed during the basic science years were hardly proof against the uncertainties of actual patient care . Susan Wheeler had no illusions concerning the fact that she knew nothing about actually being a doctor , about taking care of real live patients . Inwardly she doubted that she ever would . It was n't something she could read about and assimilate intellectually . The idea of trial by fire was diametrically opposed to her basic methodology . Yet on February 23 she was going to have to deal with patients some way , somehow . It was this crisis of confidence that made sleep difficult for her and filled the night with bizarre , disturbing dreams in which she found herself wandering through foreign mazes searching for horrible goals . Susan had no idea how closely her dreams would approximate her experience during the next few days . At 7:15 the mechanical click of the clock radio broke her dream 's feedback circuit and Susan 's brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the transistors had a chance to fill the room with raucous folk music . Normally she relied on the music to wake her . But on this particular morning she needed little assistance . She was too keyed up . Susan put her feet onto the floor and sat on the edge of the bed . The floor was cold and uninviting . Her hair descended from her head haphazardly , leaving only a two-to-three-inch gap through which to regard her room . It was n't much of a room , about twelve by fourteen feet , with two multipancd windows at the end . The windows gave out onto another brick building and a parking lot so that Susan rarely looked out . The paint was reasonably fresh because she had painted the room herself about two years previously . The color was a pleasing pastel yellow which accented perfectly the Marimekko Printex fabric she had used to make the curtains . Their colors were several shades of electric green , separated by dark blue . On the walls hung a variety of colorful posters , framed with stainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical school issue . There was an old-fashioned single bed , which was too soft , and difficult for entertaining . There was a worn , overstuffed easy chair , which Susan never used save for depositing dirty laundry . Susan liked to read on the bed and study at 16  | the desk so that the easy chair really was n't " critical , " in her words . The desk was oak and ordinary except for the pattern of initials and scratches carved in the top . In its right corner , Susan had even found a few obscene words associated with the word biochem . A physical diagnosis book was open on the desk . During the last three days she had totally reread it , but the text had failed to buoy her sagging confidence . " Shit , " she said out loud , with little inflection . The remark was directed at no one and at nothing . It was a basal response as she comprehended that February 23 had indeed arrived . Susan liked to swear and she did it a lot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wholesome image , the effect was truly remarkable . She had found it a useful and entertaining tool . Having pulled herself from the warmth of her covers with such dispatch , Susan realized that she had an extra fifteen minutes to spare . That was the usual duration of her ritual of repeatedly turning off her radio alarm before actually making it into the bathroom . Her ambivalence toward starting this day made her squander the time by just sitting and staring ahead , wishing that she had gone to law school or graduate school in literature . . . anything besides medical school . The coldness of the bare waxed floor worked its way into Susan 's feet . As she sat there , her circulatory system dissipated her body heat into the cold room , making her nipples rise up from the summits of her shapeiy breasts . Goose pimples appeared from nowhere along the insides of her naked thighs . She wore only a thin worn-out flannel nightgown she had gotten for Christmas when she was in the fifth grade . She still wore it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping alone . Somehow she loved that nightgown . Amid the furious pace of change in her life , it seemed to afford a sanctuary of consistency . Besides , it had always been her father 's favorite . Susan had enjoyed pleasing her father from a very early age . Her first remembrance of him was his smell : a mixture of the outdoors and deodorant soap covering a distinctive odor she later realized was male . Ile had always been good to her , and she knew that she was his favorite . That secret she never shared with anyone , especially not with her two younger brothers . It had always been a source of confidence for her as she faced the usual hurdles of childhood and adolescence . 17  | Susan 's father was a strong-willed individual , a dominant but generous and gentle man who ran his family and his insurance business like an enlightened despot . A charming man whose brood acknowledged him as the last word on any subject . It was n't that Susan 's mother was a weak-willed individual . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man she married . For much of her life Susan accepted this situation as the invariable norm . Eventually , however , it began to cause her some inner confusion . Susan was very much like her father , and her father encouraged her development in that direction . Then Susan began to realize she could not be like her father and expect one day to have a home of her own like the one in which she was reared . For a time she wanted desperately to be like her mother , and consciously tried . But it was to no avail . Her personality showed more and more her father 's traits , and in high school she was literally forced into a leadership role . Susan was voted president of her graduating class at a time in her life when she thought that she would have preferred to be more in the background . Susan 's father was never particularly demanding , and certainly never pushy . He remained a source of confidence and encouragement for Susan to do whatever she wanted , without considering her sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of her female classmates , she realized that many of them had emerged from a similar paternalistic background . In fact when she met some of their parents , the fathers seemed to be vaguely familiar , as if she had actually known them in the past . A resonant thumping issued from the radiator beneath the window , heralding the coming of heat . A tiny bit of steam hissed from the overflow valve . The radiator 's stirring reminded Susan of the coldness of the room . Stiffly she stood up , stretched , and closed the window . It had been open only about a half-inch . Susan lifted the nightgown over her head and regarded her naked body in the mirror on the bathroom door . Mirrors held a strange attraction for her . It was almost impossible for her to pass a mirror without at least a quick reassuring look . " Maybe you should be a dancer , Susan Wheeler , " she said rising up onto her tiptoes and stretching her arms straight up , " and give up this idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflated , she 18  | let herself sag until she was slumped over . She was still looking at herself in the mirror . " I wish I could do that , " she added more quietly . Susan was proud of her body . It was soft and supple , yet strong and well tuned . She could have been a dancer . She had good balance and she was filled with a sense of rhythm and movement . She envied Carla Curtis , a friend from Radcliffe who had gone into dance after college and was somewhere in the New York world . But Susan knew she could not actually go into dance despite her fantasy about it . She needed a vocation which would constantly exercise her brain . Susan made a horrible grimace and stuck her tongue out at the girl in the mirror , who did the same . Then Susan went into the bathroom . In the bathroom she turned on the shower . It took four or five minutes to get hot . She looked at her face in the bathroom mirror , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only her nose had been made a little more narrow , she thought that she would be quite attractive . Then she started her bathroom routine with one lavender tablet of Ortho-Novum . Among her other characteristics , Susan Wheeler was a practical woman ; strong-willed and practical . Monday February 23 7:30 A.M. The Boston Memorial Hospital is certainly not an architectural landmark , despite the disproportionately large number of architects in the Boston area . The central building is attractive and interesting . It was constructed over a century ago with brownstone blocks carefully fitted together with skill and feeling . But the structure is inconveniently small and only two stories tall . Besides , it was designed with large , general wards , now outmoded . Hence its presentday practicality is minuscule . Only the ooze of medical history which permeates its halls keeps the wreckers and the planners at bay . The innumerable larger buildings are studies in American gothic . Extending off at obtuse angles , millions upon millions of bricks join 19  | together to hold up dirty windows and flat monotonous roofs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for beds or the availability of funds . There is no doubt that it is an ugly combination of buildings , except perhaps for a few smaller research buildings . Those had architects and money to burn . But very few people ever notice the appearance of the buildings . The whole is larger than the sum of its parts ; perception is too clouded by innumerable layers of emotional response . The buildings are not buildings by themselves . They are the famed Boston Memorial Hospital , containing all the mystery and wizardry of modern medicine . Fear and excitement intermingle in an ambivalent dialogue as lay people approach the structure . And for the professional individual , it is the mecca : the pinnacle of academic medicine . The setting for the hospital adds very little . On one side a maze of railroad tracks leading to North Station and a bewildering array of elevated highways forms an enormous sculpture of rusting steel . On the other side is a modern housing project for low income families . Somehow that goal got mixed up in the renowned corruptness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing for the underprivileged because of their lack of outward design . But the rents are out of sight and only the rich and privileged live there . In front of the hospital is a stagnant corner of Boston Harbor with water like black coffee , sweetened with sewer gas . Separating the hospital and the water is a cement playground filled with discarded newspapers . By seven-thirty this Monday morning all the operating rooms at the Memorial hummed with activity . Within a five-minute interval , twenty-one scalpels sliced through unresisting human skin as the scheduled operations commenced . The fate of a sizable number of people depended on what was done or not done , what was found or not found in the twenty-one tiled rooms . A furious pace was set which would not slow down until two or three in the afternoon . By eight or nine o'clock in the evening only two rooms would still be functioning , and they often continued until the seven-thirty rush the following morning . In sharp contrast to the bustle in the OR area , the surgical lounge presented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee break pattern did not begin until after nine . By the sink was a 20  | sickly-looking man appearing much older than his sixty-two years . He was busy trying to clean the sink without moving the twenty-odd coffee cups left there half-filled with water by their owners . Walters was his name , although few knew if it was his first or last name . His whole name was Chester P. Walters . No one at all knew what the P stood for , not even Walters himself . He 'd been an employee of the Memorial OR since he was sixteen , and no one had the temerity to fire him despite the fact that he did almost nothing . He was n't well , he 'd say , and , indeed , he did not look well . His skin was a pasty white and every few minutes he 'd cough . His cough rattled with phlegm deep within his bronchial tubes , but he never coughed hard enough to get it up and out . It was as if he was content to merely keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly in the right corner of his mouth . Half the time he had to have his head cocked over to the left so that the smoke would not burn his eyes . The other occupant of the surgical lounge was an intermediate surgical resident , Mark H. Bellows . The H stood for Halpern , his mother 's maiden name . Mark Bellows was busy writing on a yellow legal tablet . Walters 's coughing as well as Walters 's cigarette definitely bugged Bellows , and Bellows would look up each time Walters started yet another coughing sequence . To Bellows it was incomprehensible how an individual could do so much bodily damage to himself and still keep it up . Bellows did not smoke ; Bellows had never smoked .. It was equally incomprehensible to Bellows how Walters managed to stay around the OR despite his appearance , personality , and the fact that he did n't do a damn thing . Surgery at the Memorial was the apogee , the zenith of the art of modern surgery , and being on its staff offered Nirvana , as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long for his appointment as a resident . Yet here , smack in the middle of all this excellence , was , as Bellows put it to his fellow residents , this ghoul . It seemed too ridiculously inconsistent . Under normal circumstances Mark Bellows would have been inside one of the twenty-one operating rooms contributing to or directing one of the acts of mayhem . But on February 23 he was adding five medical students to his burgeoning Iist of responsibilities . Bellows was currently assigned to Beard 5 , meaning the fifth floor of the Beard 21  | Building . It was a good general surgical rotation , maybe the best . As the intermediate resident of Beard 5 , Bellows was also in charge of the surgical intensive care unit physically adjacent to the ORs . Bellows reached for the table next to his chair and grasped a coffee mug without looking up from his work . He sipped the hot coffee loudly before abruptly replacing the cup with a minor clatter . He 'd thought of another " attending " who would be good at lecturing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablet . In front of him on a low table lay a piece of Surgical Department stationery . He picked it up and studied the names of the five students : George Niles , Harvey Goldberg , Susan Wheeler , Geoffrey Fairweather III , and Paul Carpin . Only two of the names made any impression . The Fairweather name made him smile and conjure up the image of a spoiled , slender fellow with glasses , Brooks Brothers shirts , and a long New England genealogy . The other name , Susan Wheeler , caught his eye purely because Bellows liked women in a general way . He also thought that women liked him in return ; after all , he was athletic and a doctor . Bellows was not very subtle in his social concepts ; he was rather naive , like most of his fellow doctors . Looking at the name Susan Wheeler , he reflected that having one female student might make the next month a little bit less of a pain in the ass . His mind did n't struggle to find a mental image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain concerned with stereotypes told him it was n't worth it . Mark Bellows had been at the Memorial for two and one half years . Things had been going well , and he was reasonably sure of finishing the program . In fact , it had begun to look as if he might have a fighting chance for the chief resident position if everything went smoothly . Having been selected while he was an intermediate resident to get a group of medical students was certainly auspicious , although a bother . It had been an unexpected turn and was the immediate result of Hugh Casey coming down with hepatitis . Hugh Casey was one of the senior residents whose job included teaching two groups of medical students during the course of the year . The hepatitis came on only three weeks earlier . Right after that Bellows had received the message to come to Dr. Howard Stark 's office . Bellows had never associated the message with Casey 's illness . In fact , with the usual paranoia following a 22  | request to come to the Chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relive all his latest blunders so as to be prepared for the tirade he expected . But contrary to his usual self , Stark had been very pleasant and had actually commended Bellows on his performance related to a recent Whipple procedure Bellows had done . After the unanticipated honeyed words , Stark had asked if Bellows would be interested in taking the medical students scheduled to be with Casey . Truthfully , Bellows would have preferred to pass up the chance while being on the Beard 5 rotation , except that one did not pass up a request by Stark even if it were carefully couched in the form of an offer . It would have been professional suicide for Bellows to have done so and he knew it . Bellows comprehended the vengeance of the affronted surgical personality , so he had agreed with the proper amount of alacrity . With a straightedge Bellows filled the front page of his yellow legal tablet with little squares about an inch on a side . He then proceeded to fill in the dates of the subsequent thirty or so days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within each square he blocked off morning and afternoon . Each morning he planned to give a lecture ; each afternoon he was going to enlist one of the attendings to give a lecture . Bellows wanted to schedule all the topics in advance to avoid duplication . Bellows was twenty-nine years old , having just celebrated a birthday the week before . However , it was relatively hard to guess his age . His skin was smooth for a man and he was in excellent physical shape . Almost without fail he jogged two to three miles per day . The only outward evidence of the fact that he was almost thirty was the thinning area on the crown of his head and the slightly receding hairline at the temples . Bellows had blue eyes and an almost imperceptible salting of gray over his ears . He had a friendly face , and he was endowed with the enviable quality of making people feel comfortable . Most everyone liked Mark Bellows . Two interns were also assigned to the Beard 5 rotation . Under the new terminology they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other residents still called them interns . They were Daniel Cartwright from Johns Hopkins and Robert Reid from Yale . They had been interns since July and hence had come a long way . But 23  | in February they were both experiencing the familiar intern depression . Enough of the year had passed to blunt the uniqueness of their roles as well as the terror of the responsibility , and yet so much remained before the year would be over and they would earn relief from the burden of every other night on call . Hence they demanded a certain amount of attention from Bellows . Cartwright was presently assigned to the intensive care unit , while Reid was on Beard 5 . Bellows decided he would also use them for the medical students . Cartwright was a bit more outgoing and would probably be more helpful . Reid was black and had recently begun to attribute being called and harassed so much to his color and not his role as an intern . That was just another symptom of the February blues , but Bellows decided that Cartwright would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walters , presumably to Bellows but in an offhand undirected way . That was what Walters always said because to him the weather was always terrible . The only conditions which made him feel comfortable were seventy-six degrees and thirty percent humidity . That temperature and water content apparently agreed with the ailing bronchial tubes in the depths of Walters 's lungs . Boston weather rarely fulfilled such narrow limits , so to Walters the weather was always terrible . " Yeah , " said Bellows in a noncommittal sort of way while he directed his attention outside . Most people would have agreed with Walters at that point . The sky was darkened by racing gray clouds . But Bellows was n't thinking about the weather . Rather suddenly he was pleased about the pending five medical students . He decided that they probably would help him in his standing in the program . And if that were the case , then the time investment was more than worthwhile . Bellows was Machiavellianly practical in the final analysis ; he had to have been to have got a position at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walters , this is my favorite kind of weather , " said Bellows , getting up from the lounge chair , indecently teasing the coughing Walters . Walters 's cigarette twitched in the corner of his mouth as he looked up at Bellows . But before he could say anything Bellows was through the door , on his way to meet his five medical students . He was convinced he could turn the burden into an asset . 24  | Monday February 23 9:00 A.M. Susan Wheeler got a ride in Geoffrey Fairweather 's Jaguar from the dorm to the hospital . It was an older vintage model , an X150 , and only three of them could squeeze into it . Paul Carpin was good friends with Fairweather so he was the other lucky one . George Niles and Harvey Goldberg had to bear the brunt of the rush hour Boston MBTA in order to get to the Memorial for the nine o'clock meeting with Mark Bellows . Once the Jaguar started , which was a minor ordeal typically associated with English motor cars , it covered the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the main entrance of the Memorial at 8:45 . The two others , having expected a miracle of modern transport to carry them the same distance in thirty minutes , arrived at 8:55 . It had taken about one hour . The meeting with Bellows was to take place in the lounge of Beard 5 ward . No one knew where the hell they were going . They all trusted to fate to lead them to the proper place as long as they walked into the Memorial itself . Medical students tend to be rather passive , especially after the first two years of sitting in lecture halls daily from nine until five . The two groups met up partly by chance , partly by design , at the main elevators . Wheeler , Fairweather , and Carpin had tried to get to Beard 5 by going up the Thompson Building elevators directly opposite the main entrance . Having been built in haphazard spurts , the Memorial was labyrinthine . " I 'm not sure I 'm going to like this place , " said George Niles rather quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator amid the morning rush . Susan was well aware of the meaning behind Niles 's simple statement . When you do n't want to go somewhere and then have trouble finding it , it 's like adding insult to injury . Besides , all five medical students were in an acute crisis of confidence . They all knew the Memorial was the most renowned teaching hospital and for that reason wanted to be there . But at the same time they felt diametrically opposed to the concept of actually 25  | being a doctor , to actually being able to handle some judgmental decision . Their white coats ostensibly associated them with the medical community and yet their ability to handle even the most simple patient-related matter was nonexistent . The stethoscopes which dangled conspicuously from their left side pockets had been used only on each other and a few hand-picked patients . Their memory of the complicated biochemical steps in the degradation of glucose within the cell afforded little support and even less practical information . Yet they were medical students from one of the best medical schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shared this delusion as the elevator lifted them floor by floor to Beard 5 . The doors opened for a doctor in a scrub suit to get out on Beard 2 . The five medical students caught a glimpse of the OR holding area in full swing . Emerging on the fifth floor , the medical students spun on their heels , not sure of which direction to take . Susan took the lead by walking down the corridor to the nurses ' station . Like the OR area below , the nurses ' station on Beard 5 was a beehive of activity . The ward clerk had his right ear glued to the telephone getting A.M. stat blood-work reports . The head nurse , Terry Linquivist , was checking the OR schedule to be sure the pre-op meds had been given to those patients who would be called within the next hour or so . The other six nurses and three LPNs were in all stages of endeavor trying either to get those patients to surgery who had been called or to take care of those patients whose surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area of directed activity with an outward show of aplomb , carefully concealing her inner uncertainties . The ward clerk seemed the most accessible . " Excuse me , but could you tell me . . . , " began Susan . The ward clerk raised his left hand toward Susan . " Tell me that hematocrit again . There 's pandemonium here , " he shouted into the telephone he held between his head and cocked-up shoulder . He wrote on a pad in front of him . " And the patient had a BUN ordered too ! " He looked up at Susan , shaking his head about the person he was talking to on the phone . Before she could say anything , his eyes went back to the patient 's chart he had out . " Of course I 'm sure a BUN was ordered . " He frantically looked through the chart to find the order 26  | sheet . " I filled out the lab request myself . " He checked in the order sheet . " Look , Dr. Needem is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Well if you do n't have enough serum get your ass up here and get , some more . The patient is scheduled for eleven . And what about Berman ; you got his lab work now ? Of course I want it ! " The clerk looked up at Susan , keeping the phone pressed between his ear and his shoulder . " What can I do for you ? " he asked Susan rapidly . " We 're medical students and I wondered if ... " " You 'd better talk to Miss Linquivist , " said the clerk suddenly as he looked down at his paper and began madly scribbling figures . He paused long enough to extend his pencil toward Terry Linquivist for Susan 's benefit . Susan looked over at Terry Linquivist . She noted that the nurse was probably about four or five years her senior . She was attractive in a wholesome sort of way , but definitely overweight according to Susan 's taste . She seemed no less busy than the clerk but Susan was not about to argue . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more than willing to let Susan take the initiative , Susan walked up to Miss Iinquivist . " Excuse me , " said Susan in a polite tone , " we are medical students assigned to ... " " Oh no , " interrupted Terry Linquivist , looking up and then rapidly putting the back of her right hand to her forehead as if she were in the throes of a migraine attack . " Just what I need , " said Linquivist to the wall , carefully emphasizing each word . " On one of the busiest days of the year , I get a new batch of medical students . " She turned to Susan and eyed her with an obvious air of exasperation . " Please do n't bother me now . " I do n't intend to bother you at all , " said Susan defensively . " I was just hoping you could tell me where the Beard 5 lounge is . " " Through those doors opposite the main desk , " said Terry Linquivist , mellowing slightly . As Susan turned and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other nurses . " You 're not going to believe it , 27  | Nance , but today is going to be one of those days . Guess what we just got ? ... We got ourselves a new group of green med students . " Susan 's ears , sensitized as they were , could pick out a few sighs and groans from the Beard 5 team . Susan moved around the clerk 's desk . He was still on the phone and still writing . She walked toward the two plain white doors opposite the desk . The others fell in beside her . " Some welcoming committee , " said Carpin . " Yeah , real red carpet treatment , " said Fairweather . Despite problems of confidence , medical students still thought of themselves as very important people . " Ah ... a couple of days and the nurses will be eating out of your hand , " said Goldberg smugly . Susan turned and flashed a disdainful glare at Goldberg , who missed it altogether . Goldberg missed most subtle social interpersonal communications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the swinging doors . The room was a jumble of old books , mostly outdated PDR 's ( Physician 's Desk Reference ) , scratch paper , dirty coffee cups , and an assortment of disposable needles and 1 . V. paraphernalia . There was a counter , desk height , that ran along the length of the wall on the left . A large commercial-type coffee maker was in the middle . At the far end was a curtainless window covered on the outside with Boston grime . Only a meager amount of February morning light penetrated the glass and fell in a pale patch on the aging linoleum floor . The illumination in the room depended entirely on an ample bank of fluorescent lights in the ceiling . The right wall had a bulletin board filled with messages , reminders , and announcements . Next was a blackboard , which had a fine covering of chalk dust . In the center of the room was a group of classroom chairs with a small desk piece on each right arm . One of them was pulled in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow legal tablet in front of him . As the medical students filed in , he lifted his left hand and studied his watch . The maneuver was for the benefit of the students , and they recognized the gesture immediately . Especially Goldberg , who was extremely sensitive about nuances which might have an effect on his grade average . 28  | No one said anything for several minutes . Bellows was silent for effect . He 'd had no experience with medical students but from his own background he felt obliged to be authoritarian . The medical students were silent because they already felt ill at ease and a bit paranoid . " It is nine-twenty , " said Bellows eyeing each student in turn . " This meeting was supposed to take place at nine , not nine-twenty . " No one contracted a single facial muscle lest Bellows 's attention be drawn to him . " I think we 'd better start out on the right foot , " continued Bellows with authority . He got up laboriously and picked up a piece of chalk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Memorial . Things happen on time . You people better take that to heart , or , believe me , your experience here is going to be . . . " Bellows searched for the proper word while he tapped the chalk on the blackboard . He looked at Susan Wheeler , whose appearance added to his momentary confusion . He glanced out of the window , " . . . a long cold winter . " Bellows looked back at the students and began a semiprepared introductory talk . He examined the faces of the students as he talked . He was sure he recognized Fairweather . The very narrow ambercolored horn-rimmed glasses fit into Bellows 's preconception . And Goldberg : Bellows was reasonably confident he could pick him out . The other two males were nondescript entities at that point to Bellows . He hazarded another glance at Susan and felt the same instantaneous confusion . He had not been prepared for the attractiveness of the girl . She was wearing dark blue slacks which seemed to cling disturbingly snugly about her thighs . Above , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a darker blue and red silk scarf tied around her neck . Her medical student white coat was casually opened . Her ample breasts defiantly advertised her sex , and Bellows was not at all ready to deal with this concept in light of the plans he had formulated for dealing with the students . With some effort he avoided looking at Susan for the time being . " You 'll be assigned to Beard 5 for only one month of your three month surgical rotation here at the Memorial , " said Bellows , shifting into a familiar monotone associated with medical pedagogy . " In some ways this is an advantage and in others a disadvantage , like so many things in life . " 29  | Carpin chuckled at this feeble attempt at philosophy , but noticing that he was alone , he shut up quickly . Bellows fixed his gaze on Carpin and continued , " Beard 5 rotation includes the surgical intensive care unit . Hence you will be subjected to an intensive teaching experience . That 's the good part . The disadvantage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand this is your first clinical rotation . Is that correct ? " Carpin looked from side to side to make sure that this last question was directed at him . " We . . . " His voice faltered , and he cleared his throat . " That 's right , " he managed to say with some difficulty . " The intensive care unit , " continued Bellows , " is an area where you all have the most to learn , but it represents the most critical area for patient care . All the orders that you write on any patient must be countersigned by myself or one of the two interns on the service , whom you will meet presently . If you write orders in the ICU they have to be countersigned the moment you write them . Orders for patients on the ward can be countersigned en masse at various times during the day . Is that clear ? " Bellows looked at each student , including Susan , who returned his gaze without altering her neutral expression . Susan 's immediate impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his opening mini-lecture on punctuality seemed a little unnecessary so early in the course of events . The monotone of his remarks combined with the pitiful stab at philosophy tended to support the image Susan had begun to construct of the surgical personality from previous conversations and her reading . . . unstable , egotistical , sensitive to criticism , and above all , dull . Susan did not notice that Mark Bellows was male . Such a thought did not even register in her mind . " Now , " said Bellows in his artificial monotone , " I 'll have some schedules Xeroxed for you which will outline the basic calendar we 'll follow while you are assigned to Beard 5 . The patients on the ward and in the ICU will be divided among you , and you are to work directly with the intern on the case . As for admissions , I want you to set up your own schedule for equitably dividing them . One of you will do a full workup on each admission . As for night call , I want at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be on only one in five 30  | nights and that 's not overburdening you . In fact , that is less than usual . If others want to stay in the evenings , that 's fine , but at least one of you stays here all night . Get together some time today and give me a schedule of who will be on when . " " Rounds will begin each morning in the ICU at six-thirty . Before then I want you to have seen your patients , collated all the necessary information to present during the rounds . Is that clear ? " Fairweather looked at Carpin in dismay . He leaned over and whispered in Carpin 's ear , " Christ , I 'll have to get up before I go to bed ! " " Do you have a question , Mr. Fairweather ? " demanded Bellows . " No , " answered Fairweather rapidly . He was intimidated by the fact that Bellows knew his name . " As for the rest of the morning , " said Bellows , eyeing his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward and introduce you to the nursing staff , who will be thrilled to meet you all , I 'm sure , " said Bellows with a wry smile . " We have experienced their joy already , " said Susan , speaking for the first time . Her voice brought Bellows 's eyes around and held them . " We did n't expect a brass band for our arrival but at the same time we did n't expect a cold shoulder . " Susan 's appearance had already somewhat unnerved Bellows . With the animation that the sound of her voice provided , Bellows 's pulse quickened slightly . There was a certain surge within his body which reminded him of watching cheerleaders in high school and wishing that they were naked . Bellows searched for words . " Miss Wheeler , you 'll have to understand that the nurses here are primarily interested in one thing . " Niles winked in agreement to Goldberg , who did n't understand what Niles was implying . " And that is patient care , damn good patient care . And when new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult goal . From actual experience they have all learned that new house staff is probably more deadly than bacteria and virus put together . So do n't expect to be greeted as saviors here , least of all from the nurses . " Bellows paused but Susan did not respond . She was thinking about 31  | Bellows . At least he was a realist and that was a glimmer of hope in the otherwise poor impression he had made on her . " At any rate , after showing you the ward , we 'll head up to surgery . There 's a staff gallbladder at ten-thirty and it will give you all a chance to get into a scrub suit and see the inside of an OR . " " And the handle of a retractor , " added Fairweather . For the first time the atmosphere lightened and everyone laughed . Down in the OR area Dr. David Cowley was absolutely pissed and he spared no one . The circulating nurse had broken into tears before the case was over and had to be replaced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombardments of foul words and captious epithets that had ever been hurled over an anesthesia screen . The surgical resident first assisting had a small cut in his right index finger from Cowley 's scalpel . Cowley was one of the more prosperous of the general surgeons at the Memorial with a spacious private office on Beard 10 . He had been spawned , trained , and now nurtured by the Memorial . When things went well , he was a most pleasant chap , full of jokes and ribald stories , always eager to offer an opinion , to bet on a game , to laugh . But when things went contrary to his wishes , he was a firebrand of the most vicious nature , a seething cauldron of invective . In short , he was a juvenile in adult clothing . His only case that day had gone poorly . To start with , the circulating nurse had put out the wrong surgical instruments . She had set up the Mayo stand with the gallbladder instruments used by the residents . Dr. Cowley had responded by picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next the patient quivered a little as he made the initial incision . It was only with great self-discipline that Cowley had curbed his inclination to hurl the scalpel at the anesthesiology resident . Then there was X-ray , who failed to show up at exactly the moment he called . Cowley 's viciousness had so unnerved the poor technician that the first couple of films were totally black . Somehow Cowley forgot the real reason the case went poorly . Cowley himself had accidentally pulled off the proximal tie on the artery to the gallbladder , causing the wound to fill up with blood in  | seconds . It had been a struggle to reisolate the vessel and get a tie around it without disturbing the integrity of the hepatic artery . Even after the bleeding had been controlled , Cowley still was not positive that he had not compromised the blood supply to the liver . Coming into the deserted doctors ' lounge , Cowley was raging . He was mumbling inaudibly as he passed down the row of lockers to his own . With emphasis he flung his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked his locker with jarring force . " Fucking incompetent assholes . This Goddamned place is going to the dogs . " The fury of his kick followed by an overhead fist which he brought against the door of the locker did several things . First , it raised a cloud of previously undisturbed dust which had settled on top of the locker over some five years . Second , it dislodged a single scrub shoe , which fell , just missing Cowley 's head . Third , it jarred open the locker next to Cowley 's , causing some of the contents to spill out onto the floor . Cowley dealt with the shoe first . He threw it as hard as he could against the far wall . Then he kicked open the locker next to his in preparation to replace the objects which had fallen out . One glance into the locker , however , made him pause . Looking closer , Cowley was astonished to see that the locker contained an enormous collection of medications . Many were open , half-used containers and vials , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pills in a bewildering assortment . Of the drugs that had fallen out , Cowley noted Demerol , succinylcholine , Innovar , Barocca-C , and curare . Within the locker were many more varieties , including an entire carton of unopened morphine bottles , syringes , plastic tubing , and tape . Quickly Cowley replaced the medicines that had fallen to the floor . Then he locked the locker once again . In his calendar book he wrote the number 338 . Cowley was going to check on that locker and see to whom it was assigned . Despite his anger , he had the presence of mind to realize that such a cache was important and had serious implications for the entire hospital . And with things that bothered him , Cowley had the memory of a sage . 33  | Monday February 23 10:15 A.M. Susan Wheeler could not go into the doctors ' lounge to change into a scrub suit because the doctors ' lounge was synonymous with the men 's lounge . Susan had to go into the nurses ' locker , which was synonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to day , thought Susan angrily . To her it was just another blatant example of male chauvinism and it gave her a momentary lift to think that she was upsetting this unfair identification . The locker room was at that moment deserted and Susan located an empty locker with ease and began to change by hanging up her white coat . Nearby the shower entrance she found the scrub suits . They were one-piece pale blue dresses made from plain cotton fabric . They were actually for the scrub nurses . She held it up and then against herself . Looking into the mirror , she felt suddenly rebellious despite the intimidating surroundings . " Screw the dress , " said Susan to the mirror . The scrub dress arched in a tumble into the canvas hamper while Susan retraced her steps into the hall . She paused before the doctors ' lounge , and she almost lost her nerve . Impulsively she pushed open the door . Bellows was at that very instant next to the door that Susan opened . He was reaching into one of the cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothed in his James Bondstyle skivvies ( that 's what he called them ) and black socks . He looked as if he belonged in the beginning of a grade C porno movie . Horror spread across his face as he caught sight of Susan . In a flash , he fled into the safety of the depths of the dressing room . As in the nurses ' locker room , one could not see into the dressing room from the door . Spurred by her rebelliousness despite the unexpected encounter , Susan advanced to the cabinet and selected a small scrub top and pants ; then she left as quickly as she had entered . She could hear a tangle of excited voices in the interior of the doctors ' lounge . Back in the nurses ' locker , she completed changing rapidly . The pale green shirt was too large , as were the pants . Because of her  | narrow waist she had to cinch up the pants to their absolute maximum before tying the cord . Mentally she began to prepare for the inevitable diatribe from Bellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . During their brief introductions on the ward , Susan had been very aware of the condescending attitude Bellows had directed toward the nurses . This attitude was ironical coming so soon after the commendable defense of the ' nurses he had made to explain their lack of enthusiasm toward new medical students . It was pretty obvious to Susan that Bellows was , among other things , a typical chauvinist . Susan decided that she would challenge that aspect of Bellows 's personality . Maybe it would make the surgical rotation at the Memorial a bit more bearable . Of course she had not planned to see Bellows in his underwear in the dressing room , but the image and symbolic aspects made Susan laugh out loud before she passed through the door into the OR area . " Miss Wheeler , I presume , " said Bellows as Susan emerged . Bellows was leaning casually against the wall to the left of the doorway , obviously waiting for Susan to appear . His right elbow was on the wall , with the hand supporting his head . Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly expected him to be waiting there for her . " I must admit , " continued Bellows , " you really caught me with my pants down . " A broad smile spread across his face , changing him in Susan 's eyes to a rather human individual . " That was one of the funniest things that has happened to me in a long time . " Susan smiled in return but it was a half-smile . She was expecting the tirade to commence immediately . " After I recovered and realized what you were after , " continued Bellows , " I started to think that it was a pretty ridiculous response on my part to bolt . If I had had any sense I would have stood there and faced you despite my dress . . . or the lack of it . At any rate , it made me think that I might have been relying on appearances a bit too much this morning . I 'm a second-year resident , that 's all . You and your friends are my first group of students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time here as profitable as possible for you all , and in the process , profitable for me as well . Least of all , we should enjoy ourselves . " 35  | With a final smile and slight nod of the head , Bellows walked away from the stunned Susan to check which room the staff gallbladder was in . It was Susan 's turn to feel a sense of confusion as she looked after him . The resolve her feelings of anger and rebelliousness had evoked had been undermined by Bellows 's sudden insight into himself . In fact it made her rebelliousness seem a trifle foolish and out of place . The fact that Susan had stimulated the insight fortuitously made it obvious that she could n't take credit for it and that she would have to revise some of her impressions about Mark Bellows . She watched Bellows walk all the way over to the main OR desk ; he was obviously at home in the alien environment . For the first time Susan was a little impressed . In fact , she thought that he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already prepared to go down to the OR . George Niles showed Susan how to put on the paper booties over her shoes and tuck in the conductive tape . Next she put on the hood and finally the mask . Once everyone was so attired , they passed the main OR desk and pushed through the swinging doors into the " clean " area of the ORs themselves . Susan had never been in an OR before . She had seen a couple of operations through the gallery windows but such an experience was akin to watching it on TV . The glass partition effectively isolated the drama . One did not feel a part of it . While walking down the long corridor Susan felt a certain excitement mixed with fear of the mortality of people . As they passed OR after OR , Susan could see clusters of figures bent over what she knew were sleeping patients with their fragile insides open to the elements . A hospital gurney approached them with a scrub nurse pulling and an anesthesiologist pushing . As the group came abreast Susan could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin back while the patient retched violently . " I hear there 's almost forty inches of packed powder at Waterville Valley , " said the anesthesiologist to the scrub nurse . " I 'm going Friday right after work , " returned the scrub nurse as the pair passed by Susan toward the recovery room . The image of the tortured face of the patient so recently operated on imprinted itself in Susan 's susceptible consciousness and she shuddered involuntarily .  | The group pulled up in front of room 18 . " Try to keep the chatter to a minimum , " said Bellows , looking through the window in the door . " The patient is already asleep . Too bad , I wanted you to see that . Well , no matter . There will be a lot of moving around during the draping procedure , etcetera , so stay back against the right wall . Once they get underway , move around so that you can see something . If you have questions , save them until later , OK ? " Bellows looked at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze , then pushed open the OR door . " Ah , Professor Bellows , welcome , " boomed a large , gowned , gloved , and sterile figure hovering in the background near some Xrays . " Professor Bellows has brought his brood of students to watch the fastest hands in the East , " he said laughing . He held up his arms in an exaggerated Hollywood surgical fashion with the hands up and bent outward as far as they would go . " I hope you have told the impressionable youths that the spectacle they are about to see is a rare treat . " " That hulk , " said Bellows to the students while motioning toward the laughing character by the X-rays and loud enough for all in the OR to hear , " is the result of staying in the program too long . That 's Stuart Johnston , one of the three senior residents . We only have to put up with him for four more months . He had promised me he 'd be civil , but I can not be sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bellows , because I stole this case from you , " said Johnston , still laughing . Then to his two assistants he said without laughing , " Let 's get the patient draped , you guys . What are you trying to do , make this your life 's work ? " The draping proceeded rapidly . A small piece of tubular metal arched over the top of the patient 's head and separated the anesthesiologist from the surgical area . By the time the draping was completed , only a small portion of the patient 's right upper abdomen was exposed . Johnston moved to the patient 's right side ; one of the assistants went over to the left side . The scrub nurse moved over the draped Mayo stand , straining with a full compliment of surgical instruments . A profusion of hemostats was lined up in a perfect array along the back of the tray . The scalpel had a new razor-sharp blade snapped into its jaws . 37  | " Knife , " said Johnston . The scalpel slapped into his gloved right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from him to provide countertraction . The medical students all moved forward silently and strained to see with a foreboding curiosity . It was like watching an execution . Their minds tried to prepare themselves for the image that was going to be imminently transmitted to their brains . Johnston held the scalpel about two inches above the pale skin while he looked over the screen at the anesthesiologist . The anesthesiologist was slowly letting the air out of the blood pressure cuff and watching the gauge . 120/80 . He looked up at Johnston and gave an imperceptible nod , tripping the poised guillotine . The scalpel dived deep into the tissues , and then with a smooth soundless slice , slid down the skin at an angle of approximately 45 degrees . The wound fell open and little jets of pulsating arterial blood sprayed the area , then ebbed and died . Meanwhile curious phenomena occurred in George Niles 's brain . The image of the knife plunging into the skin of the patient was displayed instantly in his occipital cortex . Association fibers picked up the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was associated . The association spread so rapidly and so widely that it activated an area of his hypothalamus , causing widespread dilation of his blood vessels in his muscles . The blood literally drained from his brain to fill all the dilated vessels , causing George Niles to lose consciousness . In a dead faint he fell straight backward . His flaccid neck snapped his head against the vinyl floor with a resonant thump . Johnston spun around in response to the sound of George 's head smashing against the floor . His surprise quickly metamorphosed into typically labile surgical anger . " For Christ sake , Bellows , get these kids outa here until they can stand the sight of a few red cells . " Shaking his head , he went back to catching bleeders with his hemostats . The circulating nurse broke a capsule under George 's nose and the acrid smell of the ammonia shocked him back to consciousness . Bellows bent down and felt along his neck and the back of his head . As soon as George was fully conscious , he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened , he felt immediately embarrassed . Johnston meanwhile would n't let the matter rest .  | " Holy shit , Bellows , why did n't you tell me these students were absolute greenhorns ? I mean , what would have happened if the kid fell into my wound here ? " Bellows did n't say anything . He helped George to his feet by degrees until he was satisfied George was really OK . Then he motioned for the group to leave OR No. 18 . Just before the OR door shut , Johnston could be heard angrily yelling at one of his junior residents , " Are you here to help me or hinder me ... ? " Monday February 23 11:15 A.M. George Niles 's pride was hurt more than anything else . He developed a rather sizable lump on the back of his head but there was no laceration . His pupils stayed equal in size and his memory was unimpaired . Consensus had it that he was going to make it . However , the episode dampened the spirits of the whole group . Bellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the students into the OR on the first day . George Niles was concerned lest the incident foreshadowed similar responses every time he tried to watch a surgical case . The others were bothered to a greater or lesser degree simply because within a group , the actions of one individual tend to reflect the whole group 's performance . Actually Susan was not concerned with this aspect as were the others . Susan was more distressed about the sudden and unexpected response and change in attitude of Johnston and , to a lesser extent , Bellows . One minute they were jovial and friendly ; the next minute they were angry , almost vengeful , simply because of an unexpected turn of events . Susan rekindled her preconceptions regarding the surgical personality . Perhaps such generalizations were appropriate . After changing back to their street clothes , they all had a cup of coffee in the surgical lounge . It was surprisingly good coffee , thought Susan , trying to overcome the oppressive haze of cigarette smoke 39  | which hung like Los Angeles smog from the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan was mindless of the people in the lounge until her eyes met the stare of a pasty white-skinned man hovering in the corner near the sink . It was Walters . Susan looked away and then back again , thinking that the man was not really watching her . But he was . His beady eyes burned through the cigarette haze . Walters 's omnipresent cigarette hung by some partially dried saliva holding the extreme tip in the corner of his lips . A trail of smoke snaked upward from the ash . For some unknown reason he reminded Susan of the hunchback of Notre Dame , only without a hunchback : a ghoulish figure out of place yet obviously at home in the shadows of the Memorial surgical area . Susan tried to look away but her eyes were involuntarily drawn toward the uncomfortable stare of Walters . Susan was glad when Bellows motioned to leave and they drained their cups . The exit was near to the sink , and as the group left the room , Susan had the feeling she was walking down Walters 's line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terrible day , eh , Miss , " said Walters as Susan passed . Susan did n't respond . She was glad to be rid of the staring eyes . It had added to her nascent dislike of the surgical environment of the Memorial . The group moved en masse into the ICU . As the oversized ICU door closed , the outside world faded and disappeared . A surrealistic alien environment emerged out of the gloom as the students ' eyes adjusted to the lower level of illumination . The usual sounds like voices and footsteps were muted by the sound-absorbing baffling in the ceiling . Mechanical and electronic noises dominated , particularly the rhythmical beep of the cardiac monitors and the to-and-fro hiss of the respirators . The patients were in separate alcoves , in high beds with the side rails pulled up . There was the usual profusion of intravenous bottles and lines hanging above them , connected to impaled blood vessels by sharp needles . Some of the patients were lost in layer upon layer of mummylike bandages . A few of the patients were awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that divided them from acute insanity . Susan surveyed the room . Her eyes caught the fluorescent blips racing across the front of the oscilloscope screens . She realized how  | little information she could garner from the instruments in her present state of ignorance . And the I.V . bottles themselves with their complicated labels signifying the ionic content of the contained fluid . In an instant , Susan and the other students felt the sickening feeling of incompetence ; it was as if the entire first two years of medical school had meant nothing . Feeling a modicum of safety in numbers , the five students moved even closer together and walked in unison to one of the center desks . They were following Bellows like a group of puppies . " Mark , " called one of the ICU nurses . Her name was June Shergood . She had thick luxurious blonde hair and intelligent eyes that looked through rather thick glasses . She definitely was attractive and Susan 's keen eye could detect a certain change in Bellows 's demeanor . " Wilson has been having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should hang a lidocaine drip . " She walked over to the desk . " But good old Daniel could n't seem to make up his mind , or ... something . " She extended an EKG tracing in front of Bellows . " Just look at these PVCs . " Bellows looked down at the tracing . " No , not there , you ninny , " continued Miss Shergood , " those are his usual PACs . Here , right here . " She pointed for Bellows and then looked up at him expectantly . " Looks like he needs a lidocaine drip , " said Bellows with a smile . " You bet your ass , " returned Shergood . " I mixed it up so I could give about 2 mg per minute in 500 D5W . Actually it 's all hooked up and I 'll run over and start it . And when you write the order include the fact that I gave him a bolus of 50 mg when I first saw the runs of PVCs . Also maybe you should say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth time he could n't make up his mind about a simple order . I do n't want any codes in here we can avoid . " Miss Shergood bounced over to one of the patients before Bellows could respond to her comments . Deftly and with assurance she sorted out the twisted I.V . lines to determine which line came from which bottle . She started the lidocaine drip , timing the rate of the drops falling into the plastic chamber below the bottle . This rapid exchange between the nurse and Bellows did little to buoy the already nonexistent confidence of the students . The obvious competence of 41  | the nurse made them feel even less capable . It also surprised them . The directness and seeming aggressiveness of the nurse was a far cry from their rather traditional concept of the professional nursephysician relationship under which they all still labored . Bellows pulled out a large hospital chart from the rack and placed it on the desk . Then he sat down . Susan noticed the name on the chart . N. Greenly . The students crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surgical care , any patient care really , is fluid balance , " said Bellows , opening the chart , " and this is a good case to prove the point . " The door to the ICU swung open , allowing a bit of light and hospital sounds to spill into the room . With it came Daniel Cartwright , one of the interns on Beard 5 . He was a small man , about five seven . His white outfit was rumpled and blood-spattered . He sported a moustache but his beard was not very thick and each hair was individually discernible from its origin to its tip . On the crown of his head he was going bald rather rapidly . Cartwright was a friendly sort and he came up to the group directly . " Hi , Mark , " said Cartwright making a gesture of greeting with his left hand . " We finished early on the gastrectomy so I thought I 'd tag along with you if I may . " Bellows introduced Cartwright to the group and then asked him to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " began Cartwright in a mechanical fashion , " twenty-three-year-old female , entered the Memorial approximately one week ago for a D &C.; Past medical history entirely benign and noncontributory . Routine pre-op workup normal , including negative pregnancy test . During surgery she suffered an anesthetic complication and she has been comatose and unresponsive since that time . EEG two days ago was essentially flat . Current status is stable : weight holding ; urine output good ; BP , pulse , electrolytes , etcetera , all OK . There was a slight temperature elevation yesterday afternoon but breath sounds are normal . All in all , she seems to be holding her own . " " Holding her own with a good deal of help from us , " corrected Bellows . " Twenty-three ? " asked Susan suddenly while glancing around at  | the alcoves . Her face reflected a tinge of anxiety . The soft light of the ICU hid this from the others . Susan Wheeler was twenty-three years old . " Twenty-three or twenty-four , that does n't make much difference , " said Bellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present the fluid balance problem . It made a difference to Susan . " Where is she ? " asked Susan , not sure if she really wanted to be told . " In the corner on the left , " said Bellows without looking up from the input-output sheet in the chart . " What we need to check is the exact amount of fluid the patient has put out versus the exact amount that has been given . Of course this is static data and we are more interested in the dynamic state . But we can get a pretty good idea . Now let 's see , she put out 1650 cc of urine ... " Susan was not listening at this point . Her eyes fought to discern the motionless figure in the bed in the corner . From where she was standing , she could make out only a blotch of dark hair , a pale face , and a tube issuing from the area of the mouth . The tube was connected to a large square machine next to the bed that hissed to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was covered by a white sheet ; the arms were uncovered and positioned at forty-fivedegree angles from the torso . An I.V . line ran into the left arm . Another I.V . line ran into the right side of her neck . Heightening the somber effect , a small spotlight directed its concentrated beam down from the ceiling above the patient , splashing over the head and upper body . The rest of the corner was lost in shadow . There was no motion , no sign of life save for the rhythmical hiss of the breathing machine . A plastic line curled down from under the patient and was connected to a calibrated urine container . " We also have to have an accurate daily weight , " continued Bellows . But for Susan his voice drifted in and out of her awareness . " A twenty-three-year-old woman ... " The thought reverberated in Susan 's mind . Without the aid of an extensive clinical experience , Susan was instantly lost in the human element . The age and sex 43  | similarity struck too close to home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she associated such serious medicine with old people who had had their fling at life . " How long has she been unresponsive ? " asked Susan absently , without taking her eyes from the patient in the corner , without even blinking . Bellows , interrupted by this non sequitur , turned his head up to glance at Susan . He was insensitive to Susan 's state of mind . " Eight days , " said Bellows , slightly vexed at the interruption of his harangue about fluid balance . " But that has little to do with today 's sodium level , Miss Wheeler . Could you kindly keep your mind on the subject at hand . " Bellows shifted his attention to the others . " I 'm going to be expecting you people to start writing routine fluid orders by the end of the week . Now where the hell was I ? " Bellows returned to his inputoutput calculations , and everyone except Susan leaned over to catch the expanding figures . Susan continued to stare at the motionless individual in the corner , racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D &Cs,; wondering what really divided herself or her friends from the plight of Nancy Greenly . Several minutes passed as she bit her lower lip , as was her custom when in deep thought . " How 'd it happen ? " asked Susan , again unexpectedly . Bellows 's head popped up for the second time , but more rapidly , as if he expected some imminent catastrophe . " How 'd what happen ? " he countered , scanning the room for some telltale activity . " How 'd the patient become comatose ? " Bellows sat up straight , closed his eyes and put his pencil down . As if counting to ten , he paused before speaking . " Miss Wheeler , you 've got to try to give me a hand , " said Bellows slowly and condescendingly . " You 've got to stay with us . As for the patient , it was just one of those inexplicable twists of the fickle finger of fate . OK ? Perfect health . . . routine D &C; . . . anesthesia and induction without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of cerebral hypoxia The squash did n't get the oxygen it needed . OK ? Now let 's get back to work . We 'll be here all day getting these orders written and we 've got Grand Rounds at noon . "  | " Does that kind of complication occur often ? " persisted Susan . " No , " said Bellows , " rare as hell , maybe one in a hundred thousand . " " One hundred percent for her , though , " added Susan with an edge on the tips of her words . Bellows looked up at Susan without any idea of what she was driving at . The human element in Nancy Greenly 's case had ceased to be a part of his concern . Bellows was intent on keeping the ions at the right level , keeping the urine output up , and keeping the bacteria at bay . He did not want Nancy Greenly to die while she was on his service because if she did , it would reflect on the kind of care he was capable of providing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remembered all too well what Stark had said to Johnston after a similar case had resulted in death while Johnston was on the service . It was n't that Bellows did n't care about the human element , it was just that he did n't have time for it . Besides the sheer number of cases he had been and was involved with provided a cushion or a numbness associated with anything done repeatedly . Bellows did not make the association between Susan 's and Nancy Greenly 's ages , nor did he remember the emotional susceptibility associated with an individual 's initial clinical experiences in the hospital environment . " Now for the hundredth time , let 's get back to work , " said Bellows , pulling his chair in closer to the desk and running his hand nervously through his hair . He looked at his watch before going back to his calculations . " OK , if we use 1 /4 normal saline , let 's see how many milliequivalents we 'll get in 2500 cc . " Susan was totally detached from the conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moved around the desk and approached Nancy Greenly . She moved slowly , warily , as if she were approaching something dangerous , and absorbing all the details of the scene as they came available . Nancy Greenly 's eyes were only half closed and the lower edges of her blue irises were visible . Her face was a marble white , which contrasted sharply with the sable brown of her hair . Her lips were dried and cracked , her mouth held open with a plastic mouthpiece so she would n't bite the endotracheal tube . Brownish material had crusted and hardened on her front teeth ; it was old blood .  | Feeling slightly giddy , Susan looked away for a moment and then back . The harshness of the image of the previously normal young woman made her tremble with undirected emotion . It was n't sadness per se . It was another kind of inner pain , a sense of mortality , a sense of the meaningless of life which could be so easily disrupted , a sense of hopelessness , and a sense of helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind , bringing unaccustomed moisture to the palms of her hands . As if reaching for a delicate piece of porcelain , Susan lifted one of Nancy Greenly 's hands . It was surprisingly cold and totally limp . Was she alive or dead ? The thought crossed Susan 's mind . But there directly above was the cardiac monitor with its reassuring electronic blip tracing excitedly its pattern . " I shall assume you are a whiz at fluid balance , Miss Wheeler , " said Bellows at Susan 's side . His voice broke the semitrance Susan had assumed and she replaced carefully Nancy Greenly 's hand . To Susan 's surprise the whole group had moved over to the bedside . " This , everybody , is the CVP line , the central venous pressure , " said Bellows holding up the plastic tube whose tip snaked into Nancy Greenly 's neck . " We just keep that open for now . The I.V . goes in the other side , and that 's where we 'll hang our 1/4 normal saline with the 25 milliequivalents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now then , " continued Bellows after a slight pause , obviously thinking while looking vacantly at Nancy Greenly , " Cartwright , be sure to order electrolytes on her urine today but leave the standing order for daily serum electrolytes . Oh yeah , include magnesium levels too , OK . " Cartwright was madly writing these orders down on the index card he had for Nancy Greenly . Bellows took his reflex hammer and absently tried for deep tendon reflexes on Nancy Greenly 's legs . There were none . " Why did n't you do a tracheostomy ? " asked Fairweather . Bellows looked up at Fairweather and paused . " That 's a very good question , Mr. Fairweather . " Bellows turned to Cartwright , " Why did n't we do a tracheostomy , Daniel ? " Cartwright looked from the patient to Bellows , then back to the  | patient . He became visibly flustered and consulted his index card despite the fact that he knew the information was not there . Bellows looked back at Fairweather . " That 's a very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did tell Dr. Cartwright to get the ENT boys over here to do a trach . Is n't that right , Dr. Cartwright ? " " Yeah , that 's right , " enjoined Cartwright . " I put in the call but they never called back . " " And you never followed up on it , " added Bellows with uncamouflaged irritation . " No , I got involved ... , " began Cartwright . " Cut the bullshit , Dr. Cartwright , " interrupted Bellows . " Just get the ENT boys up here stat . It does n't look like this one is going to come to , and for long-term respiratory care we need a trach . You see , Mr. Fairweather , the cuffed endotracheal tube will eventually cause necrosis of the walls of the trachea . It is a good point . " Harvey Goldberg fidgeted , wishing he had asked Fairweather 's question . Susan revived from the depths of her daydream as a result of the verbal exchange between Bellows and Cartwright . " Does anybody have any idea why this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan . " What horrible thing ? " asked Bellows nervously while he mentally checked the I.V. , the respirator , and the monitor . " Oh , you mean the fact that she never woke up . Well . . . " Bellows paused . " That reminds me . Cartwright , while you 're calling consults , have neurology get their asses up here and do another EEG on this patient . If it is still flat , maybe we can get the kidneys . " " Kidneys ? " questioned Susan with horror , trying not to think about what such a statement meant for Nancy Greenly . " Look , " said Bellows putting his hands on the railing with his arms extended . " If her squash is gone , I mean wiped out , then we might as well get the kidneys for someone else , provided of course , we can talk the family into it . " " But she might wake up , " protested Susan with color rising in her cheeks , her eyes flashing . 47  | " Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most do n't when they have a flat EEG . Let 's face it ; it means the brain is infarcted , dead , and there is no way to bring it back . You ca n't do a brain transplant although there are some cases where it might be very useful . " Bellows looked teasingly at Cartwright , who caught the innuendo and laughed . " Does n't anyone know why this patient 's brain did n't get the oxygen it needed during surgery ? " asked Susan , going back to her previous question in a desperate attempt to avoid even the thought of taking the kidneys out of Nancy Greenly . " No , " said Bellows plainly and looking directly at Susan . " It was a clean case . They 've gone over every inch of the anesthesia procedure . It happened to be one of the most compulsive of all the anesthesiology residents and he 's sucked the case dry . I mean , he 's been merciless on himself . But there 's been no explanation . It could have been some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition which made her susceptible to having a stroke , I do n't know . In any case , oxygen was apparently kept from the brain long enough so that too many of the brain cells died . It so happens that the cells of the cerebrum are very sensitive to low levels of oxygen . So they die first when the oxygen falls below a critical level and the result is what we have here " Bellows made a gesture with his hand , palm up , over Nancy Greenly " a vegetable . The heart beats because it does n't depend on the brain . But everything else must be done for the patient . We have to breathe her with the respirator there . " Bellows motioned toward the hissing machine to the right of Nancy 's head . " We have to maintain the critical balance of fluids and electrolytes as we were doing a few moments ago . We have to feed her , regulate the temperature . . . " Bellows paused after he said the word temperature . The concept keyed off his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I almost forgot about that temp elevation you mentioned a little while ago . " Bellows looked at Susan . " That 's how most of these brainstem patients depart from this life , pneumonia . . . their only friend . Sometimes I wonder what the shit I 'm doing when I treat the pneumonia . But in medicine we do n't ask questions like that . We treat the pneumonia because we have the antibiotics . " At that moment the page system came to life as it had been doing  | intermittently . This time it paged " Dr. Wheeler , Dr. Susan Wheeler , 938 please . " Paul Carpin nudged Susan and informed her about the page . Susan looked up at Bellows quite surprised . " That was for me ? " asked Susan in disbelief . " It said Doctor Wheeler . ' " " I gave the nurses on the floor a list of your names to put on the charts in order to divide up the patients among you . You 'll be paged for all the blood work and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange getting used to being called Doctor , " said Susan looking around for the nearest phone . " You 'd better get used to it because that 's the way you 'll be paged . It 's not meant to flatter you . The idea is to make it easier on the patients . You should n't hide the fact that you 're students , but do n't advertise it either . Some of the patients would n't let you touch them if they thought you were med students ; they 'd yell and scream they were being used as guinea pigs . Anyway go answer the page , Dr. Wheeler , and then catch up with us . After we finish here we 'll be up in the conference room on ten . " Susan walked over to the main desk and dialed 938 . Bellows watched her cross the room . He could n't help but notice that under the white coat lurked a sensuous figure . Bellows was being attracted to Susan Wheeler by quantum leaps . Monday February 23 11:40 A.M. It gave Susan a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She felt transparent as if she were an actress playing the role of a doctor . She had on the white coat and the scene was melodramatic and appropriate . Yet on the inside she just did n't feel like the part , and there was the thought that she would be exposed at any moment as a charlatan . 49  | At the other end of the phone line , the nurse was matter-of-fact and to the point . " We need an I.V . started on a pre-op . The case has been delayed and anesthesia wants some fluid in him . " " When would you like me to start it ? " asked Susan twisting the phone cord . " NOW ! " answered the nurse before hanging up . The other members of Susan 's group had moved on to another patient and were again huddled about the desk , straining to see the chart Bellows had pulled from the rack and had in front of him . No one looked up as Susan traversed the half-light of the ICU . She reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel handle . Turning her head slowly to the right she chanced another glance at the immobile and lifeless-appearing Nancy Greenly . Once again Susan 's mind stumbled through a painful identification . She left the ICU with difficulty but also with a sense of relief . The sense of relief was short-lived . Hurrying along the crowded corridor , Susan began to prepare herself for the next mini-hurdle . Susan had never started an I.V . before . She had drawn blood from several patients , including her lab partner , but she had never started an I.V . Intellectually she knew what was required and she knew that she could do it . After all , it only involved punching a razor-sharp needle through some thin skin and impaling a vein without going all the way through the vessel . The difficulties arose from the fact that frequently the vein was only the size of thin spaghetti with a corresponding smaller lumen . In addition , sometimes the vein could not be seen from the surface of the skin and had to be attacked blindly with only the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind Susan knew that even something as mundane as starting an I.V . was going to be a challenge of sorts . Her biggest concern was that it was going to be very apparent that she was new at the game , and perhaps the patient might rebel and demand a real doctor . Besides , she was in no frame of mind to have to put up with any exasperated ridicule from any of those bitchy nurses . When Susan arrived at Beard 5 , the scene was unchanged . The bustle of activity was as hectic as ever . Terry Linquivist gave a fleeting  | look at Susan before disappearing into the treatment room . One of the other nurses , whose cap had a bright orange stripe and whose name tag read " Sarah Sterns , " responded to Susan 's arrival by handing her the l.V. tray and a bottle of I.V . fluid . " The name 's Berman . He 's in 503 , " said Sarah Sterns . " Do n't worry about the rate . I 'll be down there in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 503 . En route she examined the I.V . tray . There were all sorts of needles : scalp needles , long-dwelling catheters , CVP lines , and traditional disposable needles . There were packets of alcohol sponges , a few lengths of flat rubber tubing to be used as the tourniquets , and a flashlight . Eyeing the flashlight , Susan wondered how many times she would repeat the scene of trudging off in the middle of the night to start an I.V . Susan passed 507 , then 505 . As 503 loomed she rummaged in the I.V . tray among the scalp needles until she located a #21 in a bright yellow packet . That was the needle she had seen an I.V . started with in the past . She was tempted to try one of the impressive-looking longdwells but she decided to keep the experimenting to a minimum , at least on her first I.V . " Room 503 " was stenciled plainly on the door . It stood slightly ajar . Susan did n't know whether she should knock or just walk in . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not being watched , she knocked . " Come in , " said a voice from within . Susan pushed open the door with her foot , clutching the I.V . tray in her right hand and the D5W bottle in her left . Expecting to see an elderly ill individual , Susan moved into the room . It was a typical private room at the Memorial : small , old , the floor tiled with vinyl squares . The window was curtainless and dirty . An old radiator stood in the corner covered with a dozen layers of paint . Contrary to Susan 's expectations , the patient was neither old nor infirm . Propped up in the hospital bed was a youngish man , seemingly in perfect health . Susan quickly estimated that he was about thirty . He was wearing the usual hospital garb with the sheet pulled up to his waist . His hair was dark and very thick , and it was brushed back on both sides of his temples so that it covered the top part of each ear . His 51  | face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season . He had a sharp nose with flared nostrils , making him appear as if he were constantly breathing in . He looked athletic and in good physical condition . His muscular arms encircled his updrawn knees . His hands worked at each other nervously as if they were cold . Susan sensed immediately the man 's anxiety through a patina of contrived calmness . " Do n't be bashful , come right in . It 's like Grand Central here , " smiled Berman . The smile wavered . It was apparent that the man welcomed an interruption in the tenseness of waiting to be called for surgery . Susan entered and allowed herself only a short look at Berman while she returned the smile . She then pushed the door to its original position . She put the tray on the foot of the bed and hung the I.V . bottle from the stand at the head of the bed . She consciously avoided Berman 's eyes while she wondered why in God 's name did Berman have to be so young , healthy , and obviously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred an unconscious centenarian . " Not another needle ! " said Berman with partially feigned overconcern . " I 'm afraid so , " said Susan opening a package of I.V . tubing , which she inserted into the bottle of D5 W on the stand , allowing some of the fluid to run through the tube before securing it with a stopcock . With that accomplished , Susan looked up at Berman , to find that he was staring intently at her . " Are you a doctor ? " asked Berman with a tone of disbelief . Susan did n't respond immediately . She continued to look directly into Berman 's deep brown eyes . In her mind she weighed the possibilities of her response . She was n't a doctor , that was obvious . What did she want to say ? She wanted to say that she was a doctor . But Susan was a realist and she wondered if she would ever be able to say she was a doctor and believe it herself . " No , " said Susan with finality while returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed her and she thought that it would add to Berman 's anxiety . " I 'm just a medical student , " she added . Berman 's hands stopped their nervous activity . " There 's no need to  | be defensive about that , " he said with sincerity . " You just do n't look like a doctor or a doctor-to-be . " Berman 's innocent comment struck a tender chord in Susan 's mind . Her embryonic professionalism made her rather paranoid and she immediately misconstrued Berman 's comment , which was meant as a backhanded compliment . " What is your name ? " continued Berman , totally unaware of the effect of his previous comment . He shielded his eyes from the glare of the overhead fluorescent lights and motioned for Susan to turn slightly to the left so he could see her name tag on her lapel . " Susan Wheeler ... Dr. Susan Wheeler . It has a natural sound to it . " Susan quickly realized that Berman was not challenging her as a doctor after all . Still she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her but she could not characterize it . Her mind tried but it was too subtly hidden in the immediacy of their encounter . It had something to do with Berman 's charming authoritarian manner . Partially as a method to concentrate her own thoughts and partially to control the conversation , Susan plunged into the I.V . affair . In a businesslike manner she placed the tourniquet about Berman 's left wrist and pulled it tight . She tore open the packets containing the scalp needle and the alcohol sponge . Berman 's eyes followed these preparations with great interest . " Got ta admit from the start , I 'm not crazy about needles , " said Berman , trying to maintain a degree of aplomb . He looked back and forth from his hand to Susan . Susan sensed Berman 's mounting concern and she wondered what he 'd say if she told him that it was her first attempt at starting an I.V . She was quite certain that he would simply become unhinged . She felt certain because she realized that if the roles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tourniquet combined forces with Berman 's ectomorphic body to make the veins on the back of his hand stand out like garden hoses . Susan took a deep breath and held it . Berman did the same . After a swipe with the alcohol pledget , Susan tried to jam the needle into the back of Berman 's hand . But the skin advanced , resisting penetration . " Ahhh , " cried Berman gripping the sheet with his free right hand . S3  | He was purposely overdoing the theatrics as a self-preservation maneuver . However , its effect was to unnerve Susan , who desisted in her attempt to break the skin . " If it 's any consolation , you feel just like a doctor , " said Berman looking at the back of his left hand . The tourniquet was still in place and the hand had an overall bluish discoloration . " Mr. Berman , you 're going to have to be a little more cooperative , " said Susan , mustering her forces for a renewed attempt and wishing to spread the responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoed Berman while rolling his eyes up inside of his head . " I 've been as quiet as a sacrificial lamb . " Susan replaced Berman 's left hand flat on the bed . With her own left hand she effected countertraction on Berman 's skin . With the same amount of effort the needle entered the scanty tissue . " I give up , " pleaded Berman with a tinge of humor . Susan concentrated on the submerged needle point . At first it tended to push the vein in front of itself . She tried the countertraction trick : same problem . She tried countertraction combined with a decisive lunge with the needle . She could feel the pop as the needle burst into the vein . Blood flowed back through the needle , filling the attached plastic tubing . Quickly she hooked up the I.V . line , opened the stopcock , and removed the tourniquet . The I.V . flowed smoothly . Both parties felt definite relief . Having actually accomplished something , something medical for a patient , Susan felt a tinge of euphoria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nonetheless a definite service . Maybe there was a future for her overall . The euphoria brought a feeling of expansiveness to Susan which included a heightened sense of warmth with a shade of condescension toward Berman in spite of the hospital environment . " You said before that I do n't look like a doctor , " said Susan , getting the tape out to secure the I.V . line to the back of Berman 's hand . " What does it mean , to look like a doctor ? " There was a slight tease to her voice as if she were more interested in hearing Berman speak than in actually listening to what he had to say . " Maybe it was a silly comment , " said Berman , watching every move Susan made while taping the I.V . line . " But I do know a few girls who went into medicine from my graduating class in college .  | Several of them were OK ; all of them were bright ; there was no doubt about that , but they were hardly feminine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went into medicine rather than vice versa , " said Susan , slowing the I.V . to a steady drip . " Possible . . . possible . . . , " said Berman thoughtfully . He recognized that Susan 's interpretation represented a new perspective . " But I do n't think so . Two of them I happen to know quite well . In fact I knew them all the way through college . They really did n't decide on medicine until the last year . They were just as nonfeminine before as after their decision . Whereas you , Dr. Wheeler-to-be , have a distinct aura of femininity that envelops you like a cloud . " Susan , eager to take exception to Berman 's comment regarding his friends ' femininity , was caught off guard by Berman 's reference to her own femininity . On the one hand she was tempted to respond , " Are you for real , buddy ? " while on the other hand she thought that Berman might be serious and actually paying her a compliment . Berman himself decided which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pick what your vocation was , " continued Berman , " I 'd have to say you were a dancer . " Having stumbled onto Susan 's own fantasy concerning her alter ego , Berman opened the door on Susan 's personality . To her , appearing like a dancer was definitely a compliment , and therefore she was more than willing to accept Berman 's comment about her femininity as a compliment as well . " Thank you , Mr. Berman , " said Susan with sincerity . " Please call me Sean , " said Berman . " Thank you , Sean , " repeated Susan . She stopped her activity of gathering up the debris from the I.V . paraphernalia and looked out the dirty window . She did n't notice the dirt , the brick , the dark clouds , nor the lifeless trees . She looked back at Berman . " You know , I would n't be able to tell you how much I appreciate your compliment . It might sound rather strange to you , but to be quite honest I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To hear someone like yourself say so is enormously reassuring . It 's not that I have dwelt on it , but just the same I have begun to think of myself as ... " Susan paused , thinking of the right word . " Neutral , or neuter . Yes that 's the right 55  | word , neuter . It has happened slowly , in degrees , and I guess I 'm really only aware of it by comparison when I get together with some of my former college classmates , especially my former roommate . " Susan suddenly stopped in the middle of her thought and straightened up . She was slightly embarrassed and surprised at her own unexpected candor . " What am I talking about ? Sometimes I ca n't believe myself . " She smiled and then laughed at herself . " I ca n't even act like a doctor , much less look like one . I 'm sure that the last thing you want to hear about is my professional adjustment difficulties ! " Berman looked up at Susan with a broad smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient is the one who is supposed to do the talking , " continued Susan , " not the doctor . Why do n't you tell me what you do so that I have to shut up ? " " I 'm an architect , " said Berman . " One of the million or so that haunt the Cambridge scene . But that is another story . I 'd much prefer to get back to you . You can not guess how reassuring it is to me to hear you talk like a human being in this place . " Berman 's eyes swept around the room . " I do n't mind having a little operation , but this waiting around is driving me up the wall . And everybody is so Goddamn matter-of-fact . " He looked back at Susan . " Tell me what you were going to say about your former roommate ; I 'd like to hear . " " Are you putting me on ? " asked Susan with narrowed eyes . " Honest . " " Well it 's not all that important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to law school and has maintained herself as a woman yet has satisfied her urge and capacity to compete and contribute intellectually . " " I have no idea how you have been doing intellectually but there is no doubt about your being a woman . You could n't be any less than the absolute antithesis of neuter . " At first Susan was tempted to get into an argument with Berman over the fact that he equated being a woman with outward appearance . She felt that was only a part , a small part . But she caught herself and refrained . After all , Berman was on his way to surgery and did n't need a debate . 56  | " I ca n't help the way I feel , " said Susan , " and neuter ' is the best description . Initially 1 thought that medicine would be good for a number of reasons , including the fact that it would provide the social insurance I needed ; I did n't want to think or worry about any social pressure to get married . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , and a good deal more . Actually , I have begun to feel excommunicated from normal society . " " In that vein I would love to be of assistance , " said Berman , pleased with his pun . " Provided , of course , you consider architects normal society . There are some who do n't , I can assure you . Anyway ... " Berman scratched the back of his head while he put his words in order . " I hardly feel capable of carrying on a reasonable conversation in this humiliating nightgown , in this depersonalized milieu , and I would like very much to continue this conversation . I 'm sure you get accosted continuously and I hate to add to your burden , but perhaps we could get together for some coffee or a drink or something after I get this Goddamn knee taken care of . " Berman held up his right knee . " Screwed the thing up years ago playing football . It 's been my Achilles heel ever since , so to speak . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan while she thought about how to respond to Berman 's offer . She knew that it was hardly professional by any stretch of the imagination . At the same time she was attracted to Berman . " That 's right , a minuscule-ectomy , or something like that , " said Berman . A knock at the door , followed by the rapid entry of Sarah Sterns before Susan could even respond , made Susan jump , and nervously she began to fuss with the stopcock on the I.V . Almost at the same time Susan realized how childish this action was , and it made her angry that the system could affect her to such a degree . " Not another needle ! " voiced Berman , dejected . " Another needle . It 's your pre-op . Roll over , my friend , " said Miss Sterns . She crowded Susan in order to put her tray on the night table . Berman glanced at Susan in a self-conscious way before rolling over on his right side . Miss Sterns bared Berman 's left buttock and grabbed 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscle . It was over almost before it began . " Do n't worry about the I.V . rate , " said Miss Sterns on her way to the door . " 1 ' 11 adjust it shortly . " She was gone . " Well , I must be going , " said Susan quickly . " Is it a date ? " asked Berman , trying not to lean on his left buttock . " Sean , I do n't know . I 'm not sure how I feel about it ; I mean professionally and all that . " " Professionally ? " Berman was genuinely surprised . " You must be being brainwashed . " " Maybe I am , " said Susan . She looked at her watch , the door , and back at Berman . " All right , " said Susan finally , " we 'll get together . Meanwhile you have to get back to normal . I 'll live with being unprofessional but I do n't want to be accused of taking advantage of a cripple . I 'll stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any idea how long you are going to be in the hospital ? " " My doctor said three days . " " I 'll stop back before you go , " said Susan already on her way to the door . At the door she had to give way to an orderly arriving with a gurney to transport Berman to the OR , to room No. 8 , for his meniscectomy . Susan glanced back at Berman before turning down the corridor . She gave him the thumbs-up sign , which he returned with a smile . As she moved down toward the nurses ' station , Susan pondered over her mixed emotions . There was the warmth of meeting someone with whom she felt a rather immediate chemical attraction ; at the same time there was the nagging reality of the unprofessionalism of it all . Susan could n't help but acknowledge that for her to be a doctor was going to be very difficult in every respect . 58  | Monday February 23 12:10 P.M. Like a slalom skier Susan wove her way down the hospital corridor crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reasonably pleasant aromas emanating from the evenly stacked trays reminded her that she had n't eaten that day : two pieces of toast on the run hardly constituted a meal . The arrival of the lunch carts added to the appearance of utter chaos at the nurses ' station on Beard 5 . It seemed to Susan that it was a wonder indeed that the right patient got the right drug , therapy , or meal . To Susan 's pleasant surprise , Sarah Sterns had a smile and a quick thank-you for Susan before pointing to the resting place for the l.V. tray . No one else even acknowledged Susan 's presence and she left . It took her about three seconds to decide to use the stairs rather than wait for the crowded elevator . After all , it was only three floors down to the ICU . The stairs were made of metal with an embossed surface like beaten silver . The color had been orange but now had become something approaching a dirty tan except in the center of each step , which was worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made of cinder block , painted dark gray . But the paint was old and peeling . Some previous plumbing catastrophe or accident had provided a series of longitudinal stains that descended from above along the wall to the right . The stains reappeared each time Susan rounded the platform and started down another flight . The only light in the stairwell came from a bare bulb at each floor landing . On the fourth floor the bulb had blown , and because of the relative darkness Susan had to proceed with caution , advancing her foot to find the first stair on the next flight down to three . The distances between the floors seemed remarkably long to Susan . By leaning out over the metal banister Susan could see down into the subbasement and up to where the spiraling stairs became lost in collapsing perspective . Susan felt slightly ill at ease in the stairwell . The decaying darkness of the walls seemed to move in on her , 59  | awakening some atavistic fear . Perhaps it reminded her of a recurrent dream she used to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream for a long time , she remembered it well . It did not concern a stairwell but the overall effect was similar . The dream involved moving through a tunnel of twisted shapes which would progressively impede her progress . She never made it to the end of the tunnel in her dream despite the fact that the goal seemed very important . In spite of the mildly disquieting atmosphere in the stairwell , Susan descended slowly , step by step . Her deliberate footsteps rang out with a dull metallic echo . She was alone . There were no people and it gave her a few uninterrupted moments to think . For a short period of time the immediacy of the hospital receded from Susan 's consciousness . The encounter with Berman became more complicated in her mind . The lack of professionalism was diluted because , in reality , Berman was not Susan 's patient . She had been called simply to provide a peripheral service . The fact that Berman was a patient was important only in facilitating their chance meeting . But Susan was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor , she paused at the head of the next flight . She had reacted to Berman as a woman . For a constellation of inexplicable reasons , Berman had appealed to her in a basic , natural , even chemical way . To an extent that was encouraging and reassuring . There was no doubt in Susan 's mind that she had begun to think of herself in a sexless sort of way over the first two years of medical school . She had used the word neuter in talking with Berman but only because she had been forced on the spur of the moment to find a term for it . Obviously she was female ; she felt female and her monthly menstrual flow emphasized its reality . But was she a woman ? Susan started down the next flight of stairs . For the first time events had forced her to intellectualize a tendency which had been developing for several years . She wondered if Carpin had been called instead of her and if Berman had been some equally attractive female , would Carpin have responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothetical situation . From her experience she decided that there was a very good possibility that Carpin would have performed in an equivalent fashion . 60  | Susan recommenced descending the stairs , very slowly now . But if it were true that a male would respond in a way similar to hers , why was it so different for her ? Why did she dwell on it ? It was more than the debatable question of medical ethics . Berman had made Susan feel like a woman . All at once it came to Susan . The biggest difference between herself and Carpin was that Susan had an extra obstacle . She knew that both of them wanted to become doctors ; to act like doctors , think like doctors , to be taken for doctors . But for Susan there was an additional step . Susan wanted also to become a woman ; to feel like a woman , to be taken for and respected as a woman . When she had entered medicine , she knew it was a maledominated career choice . That had been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it difficult for her to achieve fulfillment in a social sense . Academically she could compete ; she was reasonably sure of that . The next step was going to be harder , an uncharted course . And Carpin ? Well , for him the social part was easy . He was a male in a recognized male role . Being in medicine only supported his image of himself as a man . Carpin only had to worry about convincing himself he was a doctor ; Susan had to convince herself that she was a doctor and a woman . Arriving on the second floor , Susan was greeted by a sign which stated in bold letters : " Operating Room Area : Unauthorized Entry Forbidden . " But the sign was n't necessary . To Susan 's momentary consternation , the door was locked ! Her overly active imagination suddenly had all the doors from the stairwell locked , and she thought of herself caught within a vertical prison . It was a fleeting thought , totally irrational . " Wheeler , you 're too much , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly descended to the first floor . The door opened easily and Susan joined the surging mob on the main floor . She took the elevator and returned to the ICU entrance . It took a bit of fortitude to begin to open the door . Once she started , it took strength . The ICU door was massive and very heavy . Susan stepped once again into the nether world of the ICU interior . One of the nurses looked up from the desk but then went back to an FKG tracing in front of her . As Susan scanned the room , she was 61  | again struck by the purely mechanical appearance , the lack of human voices , even the lack of movement save for the fluorescent blips tracing their incessant patterns . And there was Nancy Greenly , as immobile as a statue , a casualty of medicine , a victim of technology . Susan wondered about her life , her loves . Everything was gone , all because of a simple menstrual irregularity , a routine D &C.; Susan forced her eyes away from Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ICU , presumably for Grand Rounds . At the same instant Susan acknowledged to herself her acute discomfort about being in the ICU . The psychological and technical complexity of the room caused any residual euphoria from the I.V . episode to vanish . Her imagination forced her to ponder the situation if something suddenly went wrong with one of the patients while she was standing there . What if someone expected her to make some life-death decision to go along with her white coat and her impotent stethoscope in her pocket ? Controlling the urge to succumb to a minor panic , Susan tugged at the inertia of the door and escaped into the corridor . Retracing her steps to the elevator , Susan mused about the difference between fact and fancy , between reality and mythology , between what it really was like being a medical student and what people thought it was like . Remembering Bellows 's comment about Grand Rounds on 10 , Susan pushed the tenth-floor button and allowed herself to be compressed toward the rear of the elevator . It was a miserable trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every conceivable affliction , and it stopped at every floor . The air was heavy and hot , particularly since one rude passenger was smoking despite the sign plainly forbidding it . The occupants did not look at each other ; they stared blankly at the light progressing from number to number , as did Susan , wishing that the doors would open and close more quickly . Impetuously she pushed her way to the front of the elevator at the ninth floor . At 10 , she broke from the crowded cubicle with relief . The atmosphere changed immediately . The tenth floor was carpeted and the walls shone with an even luster of newly applied semigloss paint . Gilded frames set off portraits of former Memorial greats in their sartorial academic splendor . Chippendale tables topped  | with a variety of lamps were interspersed between comfortable chairs along the length of the corridor . Neat piles of New Yorker magazines were arranged at rational intervals . A large sign opposite the elevator directed Susan to the conference room . As she walked down the corridor she could see into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more established doctors at the Memorial . A few patients were scattered along the corridor , reading and waiting . They all looked up as Susan passed . Their faces were uniformly expressionless . At the end of the corridor Susan passed the office of the Chief of Surgery , Dr. H. Stark . The door was ajar , and inside Susan caught a glimpse of two secretaries typing furiously . Just beyond Stark 's office and on the other side of the corridor was a second stairwell . At the very end of the corridor , over two swinging mahogany doors an illuminated sign proclaimed : " Conference in Progress . " Susan entered the conference room , letting the doors close quietly behind her . It took a few moments for her eyes to adjust to the darkness , since the room lights were out . The focal point of light at the end of the room was the projected image of a Kodachrome of a human lung . Susan could just make out the outline of a man with a pointer describing the details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern the rows of seats and their occupants . The room was about thirty feet wide and some fifty feet long . There was a gentle downward slope of the floor to the podium , which was raised by two steps . The projection equipment was professionally hidden from view . The projected beam of light , however , was visible throughout its entire path due to the swirls of cigarette and pipe smoke . Even in the darkness Susan could tell that the conference room was new , well designed , and sumptuously appointed . The next color slide was a microscopic section , and it provided relatively more light in the room . Susan was able to pick out the back of Niles 's head with its prominent lump . He was sitting in an aisle seat . She walked down to the proper row and tapped Niles on the shoulder . Susan could see that they had saved a seat for her . She had to  | squeeze past Niles and Fairweather before she could sit down . It was next to Bellows . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellows sarcastically , leaning toward Susan . " You were gone over a halfhour . " " It was an interesting patient , " said Susan , bracing for another lecture on punctuality . " You can think of a better one than that , I hope . " " To tell the truth , it was a dressing change on Robert Redford 's circumcision . " Susan pretended to be absorbed in the projected slide for a few moments . Then she looked over at Bellows , who snickered and shook his head . " You 're too much , I ... " Bellows was interrupted by becoming aware that the man on the podium was directing a question at him . All he heard was " ... you can enlighten us on that point , Dr. Bellows , can you not ? " " I 'm sorry , Dr. Stark , but I did not hear the question , " said Bellows , mildly flustered . " Has she shown any signs of pneumonia ? " repeated Stark . A large X-ray of a chest with the right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His features could not be seen . A fellow resident sitting directly behind Bellows leaned forward and whispered for Bellows 's benefit , " He 's talking about Greenly , you asshole . " " Well , " coughed Bellows , rising to his feet . " She did have a lowgrade temperature elevation yesterday . However , her chest is still clear to auscultation . A chest film two days ago was normal , but we have one pending for today . There has been some bacteria in her urine and we believe that cystitis rather than pneumonitis is the cause of the temperature elevation . " " Is that the pronoun you intended to use , Dr. Bellows ? " demanded Dr. Stark , as he walked over to the lectern , placing his hands on each side . Susan struggled to see the man ; this was the infamous and famous Chief of Surgery . But his face was still lost in shadow . " Pronoun , sir ? " intoned Bellows rather meekly and with obvious confusion . 64  | " Pronoun . Yes , pronoun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Dr. Bellows ? " There was a bit of scattered laughter . " Yes , I think I do . " " That 's better , " said Stark . " What 's better ? " persisted Bellows . As soon as he said it he wished that he had n't . More laughter . " Your pronoun choice is better , Dr. Bellows . I 'm getting rather tired of hearing we or some indeterminate third person singular . Part of your training as surgeons involves being able to deal with information , assimilate it , and then make a decision . When I ask a question of one of you residents , I want your opinion , not the group 's . It does n't mean that other people do n't contribute to the decision process but once you have made the decision , I want to hear I , not we or one . " Stark walked a few steps from the lectern and leaned on the pointer . " Now then , back to the care of the comatose patient . I want to stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen . Although it can be frustrating because of the intense chronic care that is required and , perhaps , because of the grim ultimate prognosis , the rewards can be fabulous . The teaching aspect alone is priceless . I lomeostasis is indeed extremely difficult to maintain over protracted periods of time when the brain ... " A red light on the side wall suddenly sprang to life , blinking frantically . All eyes in the conference room turned toward it . Silently a message flashed onto a TV screen below the red light : " Cardiac Arrest Intensive Care Unit Beard 2 . " " Shit , " muttered Bellows as he jumped up . Cartwright and Reid followed at his heels , and the three pushed their way to the aisle . Susan and the other four med students hesitated for a moment , looking at each other for encouragement . Then they followed en masse . " As I was saying , homeostasis is difficult to maintain when the brain is damaged beyond repair . Next slide , please , " said Stark consulting his notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storming from the room . 65  | Monday February 23 12:16 P.M. There was no doubt that Sean Berman was very nervous about being in the hospital , facing imminent surgery . He knew very little about medicine , and although he wished that he were better informed , he had not bothered to inquire intelligently about his problem and its treatment . He was frightened about medicine and disease . In fact he tended to equate the two rather than think of them as antagonists . Hence the thought of undergoing surgery offended his sensibility ; there was no way for him to deal rationally with the idea that someone was going to cut his skin with a knife . The thought made his stomach sink and sweat appear on his forehead . So he tried not to think about it . In psychiatric terms this was called denial . He had been reasonably successful until he had come to the hospital the afternoon before his scheduled surgery . " The name is Berman . Sean Berman . " Berman remembered the admission sequence all too well . What should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucratic tangle of the hospital . " Berman ? Are you sure you 're to come to the Memorial today ? " questioned the well-meaning , overly made-up receptionist , who wore black nail polish . " Yes , I 'm sure , " returned Berman , marveling at the black nail polish . It made him realize that hospitals were monopolies of sorts . In a competitive business someone would have the sense to keep the receptionist from wearing black nail polish . " Well , I 'm sorry but I do n't have a file for you . You 'll have to take a seat while I handle these other patients . Then I 'll call Admitting and I 'll be with you shortly . " So commenced the first of several snafus which characterized Sean Berman 's admission . He sat down and waited . The big hand of the clock worked its way through an entire revolution before he was admitted . " May I have your X-ray request , please ? " asked a young and 66  | extremely thin X-ray technician . Berman had waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have an X-ray request , " said Berman , glancing through the papers he 'd been given . " You must have one . All admissions have one . " " But I do n't . " " You must . " " I tell you I do n't . " Despite the obvious frustration , the ridiculous admission sequence had had one positive effect . It had totally occupied Berman 's consciousness , and he did not dwell upon his impending surgery . But once in his room , hearing the random moans through partially closed hospital doors , Sean Berman was forced to confront his imminent experience . Even more difficult to dismiss were the people with bandages or even tubes that issued forth mysteriously from areas of the human body without natural orifices . Once in the hospital environment , denial was no longer an effective means of psychological defense . Berman then tried another tactic ; he switched to what the psychiatrists call reaction formation . He let himself think about his upcoming operation to the point where he seemingly made light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to discuss your meal selection , " said an overweight woman with a clipboard who entered Berman 's room after a sharp knock . " You are here to have surgery , I presume . " Surgery ? " Berman smiled . " Yeah , I have it about once a year . It 's a hobby . " The dietician , the lab technician , anyone who would listen , became a victim of Berman 's offhand comment about his scheduled operation . To an extent this method of defense was successful , at least until the actual morning of the operation . Berman had been awakened at sixthirty by the sound of some jangling cart in the corridor . Try as he might , he had been unable to fall back to sleep . Reading had been impossible . The time had dragged horribly , slowly yet inexorably 67  | toward 11 , when his surgery was scheduled . His stomach had growled from its emptiness . At 11:05 the door to his room burst open . Berman 's pulse fluttered . It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a delay . " " A delay ? How long ? " Berman forced himself to be civil . The agony of anticipation was taking its toll . " Ca n't say . Thirty minutes , an hour . " The nurse shrugged . " But why ? I 'm starved . " Berman really was n't hungry ; he was too nervous . " The OR 's backed up . I 'll be back later to give you your pre-op meds . Just relax . " The nurse departed . Berman 's mouth was open , ready for another question , a hundred questions . Relax ? Fat chance . In fact , until Susan 's appearance , Sean Berman had spent the entire morning in an uninterrupted cold sweat , dreading the passage of each moment , yet at the same time wishing time would hurry by . Several times he had felt a tinge of embarrassment at the depth of his anxiety , and he wondered if his feelings were relative to the seriousness of the anticipated surgery . If that were the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Berman was worried about feeling pain , worried that his leg might not be ninety-eight percent better , as his doctor had promised , worried about the cast he would have to wear on his leg for several weeks after the operation . He was n't worried about the anesthesia . If anything , he worried that they might not put him to sleep . He did not want local anesthesia ; he wanted to be out cold . Berman did not worry about possible complications , nor did he worry about his mortality . He was too young and healthy for that . If he had , he would have thought twice about having the operation . It had always been one of Berman 's faults , to miss the forest for the trees . Once he had designed an architecturally award-winning building only to have it turned down by the local city council just because it did not fit into the surroundings . Fortunately Berman was unaware of the stricken Nancy Greenly in the ICU . For Berman , Susan Wheeler had been a star on a cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seemed like an apparition coming to help him pass the time , to ease his mind . But she 68  | had done more . For the first few moments of the morning Berman had been able to think of something besides his knee and the knife . He had given every ounce of concentration to Susan 's comments and all too brief self-revelation . Whether it was Susan 's attractiveness or her obvious wit or just Berman 's own emotional vulnerability , he had been charmed and delighted and felt immeasurably more comfortable on his ride in the elevator down to the operating room . He also considered that the shot Ms. Sterns had given him might have contributed , because he began to get a little light-headed and images began to be slightly discontinuous . " Guess you see a lot of people on their way to surgery , " said Berman to the orderly , as the elevator approached floor two . Berman was on his back , his hands beneath his head . " Yup , " said the orderly , uninterested , cleaning under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Berman , enjoying a sensation of calmness and detachment spreading through his limbs . " Nope . I 'd never have an operation here , " said the orderly , looking up at the floor indicator as the car eased to a stop on two . " Why not ? " asked Berman . " I 've seen too much , I guess , " said the orderly , pushing Berman into the hall . By the time his gurney was parked in the patient holding area , Berman was happily inebriated . The shot he had received on orders from the anesthesiologist , a Dr. Norman Goodman , was 1 cc of Innovar , a relatively new combination of extremely potent agents . Berman tried to talk to the woman next to him in the patient holding area , but his tongue seemed to have become unresponsive , and he laughed at his own ineffectual efforts . He tried to grab a nurse who walked by , but he missed , and he laughed . Time ceased to be a concern and Berman 's brain no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressing well . Penny O'Rilley was already scrubbed and gowned and had brought in the steaming tray of instruments to put out on the Mayo stand . Mary Abruzzi , the circulating nurse , had located one of the pneumatic tourniquets and had carried it into the room . " One more to go , Dr. Goodman , " said Mary , activating the foot pedal to raise the operating table to gurney height . 69  | " How right you are , " said Dr. Goodman cheerfully . He let I.V . fluid run through the tube onto the floor to remove the bubbles . " This should be a rapid case . Dr. Spallek is one of the fastest surgeons I know and the patient is a healthy young man . I bet we 're out of here by one . " Doctor Norman Goodman had been on the staff at the Memorial for eight years and held a joint appointment at the medical school . He had a lab on the fourth floor of the Hilman Building with a large population of monkeys . His interests involved developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt that eventually drugs were going to be specific enough so that just the reticular formation itself would be altered , thereby reducing the amount of drugs necessary to control anesthesia . In fact , only a few weeks earlier he and his laboratory assistant , Dr. Clark Nelson , had stumbled onto a butyrophenone derivative which had slowed the electrical activity only in the reticular formation of a monkey . With great discipline he had kept himself from becoming overly encouraged at such an early time , especially when the results had been from a single animal . But then the results had become reproducible . So far he had tested eight monkeys and all had responded the same . Dr. Norman Goodman would have preferred to give up all activities and devote twenty-four hours a day to his new discovery . He was eager to advance to more sophisticated experiments with his drug , especially a trial on a human . Dr. Nelson , if anything , was even more eager and optimistic . It had been with difficulty that Dr. Goodman had talked Dr. Nelson out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Goodman knew that true science rested on a foundation of painstaking methodology . One had to proceed slowly , objectively . Premature trials , claims , or disclosure could be disastrous for all concerned . Accordingly Dr. Goodman had to rein in his excitement and maintain his normal schedule and commitments unless he was willing to divulge his discovery ; and that he was unwilling to do as yet . So on Monday morning he had to " pass gas , " as they called it in the vernacular . . . devote time to clinical anesthesia . " Damn , " said Dr. Goodman straightening up . " Mary , I forgot to 70  | bring down an endotracheal tube . Would you run back to the anesthesia room and bring me a number eight . " " Coming up , " said Mary Abruzzi , disappearing through the OR door . Dr. Goodman sorted out the gas line connectors and plugged into the nitrous oxide and oxygen sources on the wall . Sean Berman was Dr. Goodman 's fourth and final case for February 23 , 1976 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A **33;687;TOOLONG flatulent female with gallstones had been the only potential problem . Dr. Goodman had feared that the enormous bulk of fatty tissue would have absorbed such large quantities of the anesthetic agent that termination of the anesthesia would have been very difficult . But that had not proved to be the case . Despite the fact that the case had been prolonged the patient had awakened very quickly and extubation had been carried out almost immediately after the final skin suture had been tied . The other two cases that morning had been very routine : a vein stripping and a hemorrhoid . The final case for Dr. Goodman , Berman , was to be a meniscectomy of the right knee and Dr. Goodman expected to be in his lab by 1:15 at the latest . Every Monday morning Dr. Goodman thanked his lucky stars that he had had enough foresight to have continued his research proclivities . He found clinical anesthesia a bore ; it was too easy , too routine , and frightfully dull . The only way he kept his sanity those Monday mornings , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide food for his brain , to force him to think rather than just sit there and daydream . If there were no contraindications , he liked balanced anesthesia the best , meaning he did not have to give the patient some gargantuan dose of any one agent , but rather he balanced the needs by a number of different agents . Neurolept anesthesia was his favorite because in certain respects it was a crude precursor to the types of anesthetic agents he was looking for . Mary Abruzzi returned with the endotracheal tube . " Mary , you 're a doll , " said Dr. Goodman , checking off his preparations . " I think we 're ready . How about bringing the patient down ? " 71  | " My pleasure . I 'm not going to get lunch until we finish this case . " Mary Abruzzi left for the second time . Since Berman did not offer any contraindications , Goodman decided to use neurolept-anesthesia . He knew Spallek did n't care . Most orthopedic surgeons did n't care . " Just get them down enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I care about " was the usual orthopedic response to the query about which anesthetic agent they might prefer . Neurolept anesthesia was a balanced technique . The patient was given a potent neurolept , or tranquilizing agent , and a potent analgesic , or painkiller . Both agents provided easily arousable sleep as a side effect . Dr. Goodman liked droperidol and fentanyl best of the agents cleared for use . After they were given , the patient was put to sleep with Pentothal and maintained asleep on nitrous oxide . Curare was used to paralyze the skeletal muscles for entubation and surgical relaxation . During the case aliquots of the neurolept and analgesic agents were used as needed to maintain the proper depth of anesthesia . The patient had to be watched very closely through all this , and Dr. Goodman liked that . For him the time passed more quickly when he was busy . The OR door was opened by one of the orderlies helping to guide Berman 's gurney into room No. 8 . Mary Abruzzi was pushing . " Here 's your baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mary Abruzzi . They put down the arm rails . " OK , Mr. Berman . Time to move over onto the table . " Mary Abruzzi gently shook Berman 's shoulder . He opened his eyelids about halfway . " You have to help us , Mr. Berman . " With some difficulty they got Berman over onto the table . Smacking his lips , turning on his side , and drawing up the sheet around his neck , Berman gave the impression that he thought he was home in his own bed . " OK , Rip Van Winkle , on your back . " Mary Abruzzi coaxed Berman onto his back and secured his right arm to his side . Berman slept , apparently unaware of the activity about him . The cuff of the pneumatic tourniquet was placed about his right thigh and tested . The heel of his right foot was placed in a sling and hung from a stainless  | steel rod at the foot of the operating table , lifting the entire right leg . Ted Colbert , the assisting resident , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Goodman went right to work . The time was 12:20 . Blood pressure was 110/75 ; pulse was seventy-two and regular . He started an I.V . with deftness which belied the difficulties of handling a largebore intravenous catheter . The whole process from skin puncture to tape took less than sixty seconds . Mary Abruzzi attached the cardiac monitor leads , and the room echoed with the high-pitched but low-amplitude beeps . With the anesthesia machine rigged and ready , Dr. Goodman attached a syringe to the I.V . line . " OK , Mr. Berman , I want you to relax now , " kidded Dr. Goodman , smiling at Mary Abruzzi . " If he relaxes any more , he 's going to pour off the table , " laughed Mary . Dr. Goodman injected intravenously a 6 cc bolus of Innovar , the same droperidol and fentanyl combination that had been used as the pre-op medication . Then he tested the lid reflex and noted that Berman had already achieved a deep level of sleep . Consequently Dr. Goodman decided that the Pentothal was not needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black rubber mask over Berman 's face . Blood pressure was 105/75 ; pulse was sixtytwo and regular . Dr. Goodman injected 0.40 mg of d-tubocurarine , the drug which represents a debt modern society owes to the Amazon peoples . There were a few muscle twitches in Berman 's body , then relaxation followed ; breathing stopped . The entubation was rapid and Dr. Goodman inflated Berman 's lungs with the ventilating bag while he listened to each side of the chest with his stethoscope . Both sides aerated evenly and fully . Once the pneumatic tourniquet was cajoled into functioning , Dr. Spallek breezed into the room , and the case went rapidly . Dr. Spallek was into the joint in one dramatic slice . " Voila , " he said , holding the scalpel in the air and tilting his head to admire his handiwork . " And now for the Michelangelo touch . " Penny O'Rilley 's eyes rolled up inside of her head in response to 73  | Dr. Spallek 's theatrics . She handed him the meniscus knife with a trace of a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dr. Spallek holding the knife out for the resident to squirt irrigation fluid over its tip . The knife was then inserted into the joint and for a few moments Dr. Spallek rooted around blindly , his face upturned toward the ceiling . He was cutting by feel alone . There was a faint grinding sound , then a snap . " OK , " said Dr. Spallek tightening his teeth , " here comes the culprit . " Out came the damaged cartilage . " Now I want everyone to see this . See this little tear on the inside edge . That 's what 's been causing this chap 's problems . " Dr. Colbert looked from the specimen to Penny O'Rilley . They both nodded approval while both secretly wondered if the little tear had n't been caused by the blind cutting with the meniscus knife . Dr. Spallek stepped back from the table , pleased with himself . He snapped off his gloves . " Dr. Colbert , why do n't you close up . 4 - 0 chromic , 5 - 0 plain , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the lounge . " Then he was gone . Dr. Colbert dabbed ineffectually at the wound for a few moments . " How much longer do you estimate ? " questioned Dr. Goodman over the ether screen . Dr. Colbert looked up . " Fifteen or twenty minutes , I guess . " He palmed a pair of toothed forceps and took the first suture from Penny O'Rilley . He took a bite with the suture and Berman moved . At the same time Dr. Goodman felt a tenseness in the ventilating bag when he tried to breathe Berman . He sensed that Berman was trying to breathe on his own . Concurrently the blood pressure rose to 110/80 . " He must be a little light , " said Dr. Colbert , trying to sort out the layers of tissue in the wound . " I 'll give him a bit more of this love potion , " said Dr. Goodman . He injected another full cc of Innovar , since the syringe with the Innovar was still connected to the I.V . line . Later he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have used only the analgesic , fentanyl . The blood pressure responded rapidly and fell as Berman 's anesthesia 74  | deepened again . The blood pressure leveled off at 90/60 . The pulse increased to 80 per minute , then fell to a comfortable 72 per minute . " He 's OK now , " said Dr. Goodman . " Good . OK , Penny , feed me those chromic sutures and I 'll get this joint closed , " said Colbert . The resident made fine headway , closing the joint capsule and then the subcutaneous tissues . There was no conversation . Mary Abruzzi sat down in the corner and turned on a small transistor radio . Very faint rock music trickled through the room . Dr. Goodman started the final notations on the anesthesia record . " Skin sutures , " said Dr. Colbert , straightening up from his crouch over the knee . There was the familiar slapping sound as the needle holder was thrust into his open hand . Mary Abruzzi changed her worn-out gum for a new stick by lifting the lower part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventricular contraction followed by a compensatory pause . Dr. Goodman 's eyes looked up at the monitor . The resident asked for more suture . Dr. Goodman increased the oxygen flow to wash out the nitrous oxide . Then there were two more abnormal ectopic heartbeats and the heart rate increased to about 90 per minute . The change in the audible rhythm caught the attention of the scrub nurse , who looked at Dr. Goodman . Satisfied that he was aware , she went back to supplying the resident with skin sutures , slapping a loaded needle holder in his hand every time he reached up . Dr. Goodman stopped the oxygen , thinking that maybe the myocardium or heart muscle was particularly sensitive to the high oxygen levels that were obviously in the blood . Later he admitted that this might have been a mistake as well . He began to use compressed air for aerating Berman 's lungs . Berman was still not breathing on his own . In quick succession there were several back-to-back runs of the strange premature-type heartbeats , which made Dr. Goodman 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too well that such runs of premature ventricular contractions often were the immediate harbinger of cardiac arrest . Dr. Goodman 's hands visibly trembled as he inflated the blood pressure cuff . Blood pressure was 80/55 ; it had 75  | fallen for no apparent reason . Dr. Goodman looked up at the monitor as the premature beats began to increase in frequency . The beeping sound became faster and faster , screaming its urgent information intb Dr. Goodman 's brain . His eyes swept over the anesthesia machine , the carbon dioxide canister . His mind raced for an answer . He could feel his bowels loosen and he had to clamp down voluntarily with the muscles of his anus . Terror spread through him . Something was wrong . The premature beats were increasing to the point that normal beats were being crowded out as the electronic blip on the monitor began to trace a senseless pattern . " What the hell 's going on ? " yelled Dr. Colbert , looking up from his suturing job . Dr. Goodman did n't answer . His trembling hands searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the circulating nurse . He tried to pull the plastic cap from the end of the needle but it would not come off . " Christ , " he yelled and flung the syringe against the wall in utter frustration . He tore the cellophane cover from another syringe and managed to get the cap off the needle . Mary Abruzzi tried to hold the lidocaine bottle for him but his trembling hands made it impossible . He snatched the bottle from her and thrust in the needle . " Holy shit , this guy 's going to arrest , " said Dr. Colbert in disbelief . He was staring at the monitor . The needle holder was still in his right hand ; a pair of fine-toothed forceps were in his left hand . Dr. Goodman filled the syringe with the lidocaine , dropping the bottle in the process so that it shattered on the tile floor . Struggling with his trembling he tried to insert the needle into the I.V . line and succeeded only in jabbing his own index finger , bringing a drop of blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Dr. Goodman could get the lidocaine into the I.V . line , the monitor abruptly returned to its steady , pre-crisis rhythm . In utter disbelief Dr. Goodman looked at the electronic blip moving through its familiar and normal pattern . Then he grasped the ventilating bag and inflated Berman 's lungs . Blood pressure read 100/60 and the pulse slowed evenly to about seventy per minute . Perspiration coalesced on Dr. Goodman 's forehead and dripped off the bridge of his nose onto the anesthesia record . His own heart rate was over one hundred per  | minute . Dr. Goodman decided that clinical anesthesia was not always dull . " What in God 's name was all that about ? " asked Dr. Colbert. " 1 have n't the slightest idea , " said Dr. Goodman . " But finish up . I want to wake this guy up . " " Maybe it 's something wrong with the monitor , " said Mary Abruzzi , trying to be optimistic . The resident finished the skin sutures . For a few minutes Dr. Goodman had them hold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate increased slightly but then returned to normal . The resident started to cast Berman 's leg . Dr. Goodman continued to aerate the patient while he kept one eye on the monitor . The rate stayed normal . Dr. Goodman tried to record the events on the anesthesia record in between compressions of the ventilating bag . When the cast was completed , Dr. Goodman waited to see if Berman would breathe on his own . There was no breathing effort at all , and Dr. Goodman took over again . He looked at the clock . It was 12:45 . He wondered if he should give an antagonist for the fentanyl to try to curtail the respiratory depressant effect it was apparently causing . At the same time he wanted to keep the medication that he gave to Berman to a minimum . His own clammy skin reminded him vividly that Berman was no routine case . Dr. Goodman wondered if Berman was getting light despite the fact that he was not breathing . He decided to test the lid reflex to find out . There was no response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lid and he noted something very strange . Usually the fentanyl , like other strong narcotics , produced very small pupils . Berman 's pupils were enormous . The black area almost filled the clear cornea . Dr. Goodman reached for a penlight and directed the beam into Berman 's eye . A ruby red reflex flashed back but the pupil did not budge . In total disbelief , Dr. Goodman did it again , then again . He did it once more before his own eyes looked up at nothing . Dr. Goodman said two words out loud ... " Good God ! " 77  | Monday February 23 12:34 P.M. For Susan Wheeler and the other four medical students , the charge down the hall to the elevator fitted perfectly their preconceptions of the excitement of clinical medicine . There was something horribly dramatic about the headlong rush . Startled patients sitting there casually leafing through old New Yorker magazines while waiting to see their doctors reacted to the stampeding group by drawing their legs and feet more closely to their chairs . They stared at the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other paraphernalia to keep them from flying from their pockets . As the group came abreast of , then passed , each patient , the patient 's head swung around to watch the group recede down the corridor . Each assumed that a group of doctors had been called on an emergency , and it was reassuring for the patients to see how earnestly the doctors responded ; the Memorial was a great hospital . At the elevator there was momentary confusion and delay . Bellows repeatedly pushed the " down " button as if manhandling the plastic object would bring the elevator more quickly . The floor indicator above each elevator door suggested that the elevators were taking their own sweet time , slowly rising from floor to floor , obviously discharging and taking on passengers in the usual slow motion . For such emergencies there was a phone next to the elevators . Bellows snatched it off its cradle and dialed the operator . But the operator did n't answer . It usually took the operators at the Memorial about five minutes to answer a house phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tenth time . His eyes darted from the exit sign over the stairwell back to the floor indicator above the elevator . " The stairs , " said Bellows with decision . In rapid succession the group entered the stairwell and began the long twisting plunge from the tenth floor to the second floor . The journey seemed interminable . Taking two or three steps at a time , constantly turning to the left , the group began to spread out a bit . 78  | They passed the sixth floor , then the fifth . At the fourth floor the whole group slowed to a cautious walk in the dark because of the missing light bulb . Then down again at the previous pace . Fairweather began to slow and Susan passed him on the inside . " I do n't know what the hell we are running for , " panted Fairweather as Susan passed . Susan managed to brush her hair from her face , hooking it behind her right ear . " As long as Bellows et al . are in the lead , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on but I do n't want to be the first one on the scene . " Fairweather assumed a comfortable walk and was quickly left behind . Susan was nearing the third floor landing when she heard Bellows pound on the locked door on two . He yelled at the top of his lungs for someone to open the door , and his voice carried up the stairwell , reverberating strangely , taking on a warbling quality . As Susan rounded the final landing , the door on two was opened . Niles kept the door open for her and she entered the hall . The constant turning to the left in the stairwell made Susan feel a bit dizzy , but she did not stop . Following the others , she ran directly into the ICU . In sharp contrast to the former dimness of the room , it was now brightly illuminated with stark fluorescent light that provided a shimmering aura to objects within the room . The white vinyl floor added to this effect . In the corner the three ICU nurses were engaged in giving closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reid , and the medical students crowded around the bed . " Hold up , " said Bellows watching the cardiac monitor . The nurse giving the closed chest massage straightened up from her efforts . She was kneeling on the edge of the bed on the right side of Nancy Greenly . The monitor pattern was wildly erratic . " She 's been fibrillating for four minutes , " said Shergood watching the monitor . " We started the massage within ten seconds . " Bellows moved rapidly over to the right of Nancy Greenly and while watching the monitor , he thumped the patient 's sternum with his fist . Susan winced at the dull sound of the blow . The monitor 's pattern did not alter . Bellows began closed chest massage . " Cartwright , feel for a pulse in the groin , " said Bellows without taking his eyes from the monitor . " Charge the defibrillator to 400 79  | joules . " The last command was directed to anyone . One of the ICU nurses carried it out . Susan and the other students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mere observers , and although they wanted to , they could not help in the frantic activity occurring before them . " You 've got a good pulse going , " said Cartwright with his hand pressed in Nancy Greenly 's groin . " Was there any warning for this or did it drop out of the blue ? " said Bellows with some difficulty between compressions of the chest . He nodded his head toward the monitor . " Very little warning , " answered Shergood . " She began to have a suggestion of increased excitability of her heart by having a few premature ventricular beats and a suggestion of a mild atrioventricular conduction defect which we picked up on the recorder . " Shergood held up a strip of EKG paper for Bellows to see . " Then she had a sudden run of extra systoles , and wham . . . fibrillation . " " What has she got so far ? " asked Bellows . " Nothing , " said Shergood . " OK , " said Bellows . " Push an amp of bicarbonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a syringe with a cardiac needle . " One of the ICU nurses injected the bicarbonate ; another prepared the epinephrine . " Somebody draw blood for stat electrolytes and calcium , " said Bellows , letting Reid take over the massage . Bellows felt the femoral pulse under Cartwright 's hand and was satisfied . " From what Billings said at the complication conference on this case , the same thing is happening here that happened in the OR to cause all her troubles in the first place , " said Bellows thoughtfully . He took the 10 cc syringe with the epinephrine from the nurse , holding it up to let the last traces of air escape . " Not quite , " said Reid between compressions . " She never fibrillated in the OR . " " She did n't fibrillate but she did have premature ventricular contractions . Obviously she had an excitable heart then as now . All right , hold up ! " Bellows moved along Nancy Greenly 's left side , brandishing the syringe with the cardiac needle . Reid straightened up from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Greenly 's sternum for the landmark called the angle of Louis . Using that as a guide , he located the fourth interspace between the ribs . The needle on Bellows 's syringe was three and a half inches long and a sparkle of reflected light danced off its stainless steel shaft . Decisively Bellows pushed it into the girl 's chest , all the way to the hilt . When the plunger was pulled back , dark red blood swirled up into the clear epinephrine solution . " Right on , " said Bellows as he rapidly injected the epinephrine directly into the heart . Susan 's skin crawled with the vivid thought of the long needle tearing its way down into Nancy Greenly 's chest and spearing the quivering mass of cardiac muscle . Susan could almost feel the coldness of the needle in her own heart . " Go to it , " said Bellows to Reid as he stepped back from the bed . Reid immediately recommenced his cardiac massage . Cartwright nodded , indicating that there was a strong femoral pulse . " Stark is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " continued Bellows , eyeing the monitor , " especially right after his lecture on vigilance in these cases . Shit , I really do n't deserve this kind of headache . If she croaks , my ass is grass . " Susan had trouble comprehending that Bellows had actually said what he did . Once again she was faced with the fact that Bellows and probably the entire crew were not thinking of Nancy Greenly as a person . The patient seemed more like the part of a complicated game , like the relationship between the football and the teams at play . The football was important only as an object to advance the position and advantage of one of the teams . Nancy Greenly had become a technical challenge , a game to be played . The final , ultimate result had become less important than the day-to-day plays and moves and ripostes . Susan felt a strong surge of ambivalence toward clinical medicine . Her nascent female sensitivities seemed to be a handicap within the mechanistic and tactically oriented atmosphere . She silently longed for the old familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too cold , too detached . And yet there was something fascinating and academically satisfying seeing the application of the basic scientific knowledge she had acquired . From physiology experiments with animal hearts , she 81  | comprehended the disorganization that the fibrillating heart within Nancy Greenly represented . If only the whole mass could be depolarized to stop all electrical activity , then the intrinsic rhythm could possibly begin again . Susan strained to watch as Bellows placed the defibrillating paddles on Nancy Greenly 's exposed chest . One of the paddles was held directly over the sternum , the other was placed against the left lateral chest , slightly distorting the left breast with its pale nipple . " Everyone away from the bed ! " ordered Bellows . His right thumb made contact and a powerful electric charge spread through Nancy Greenly 's chest , arcing from one paddle to the other . Her body jerked upward ; her arms flopped across her chest with her hands twisting inward . The electronic blip disappeared from the screen , then it returned . It traced a relatively normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Cartwright . Reid held up on the external massage . The rate held steady for several minutes . Then a premature ventricular contraction appeared . The rate was again steady for several minutes followed by three premature ventricular contractions in a row . " V tach , " said Shergood confidently . " The heart is still very easily excitable . There has to be something very basic wrong here . " " If you know what it is , do n't keep it from us , " said Bellows . " Meanwhile let 's have some lidocaine , 50 cc . " One of the nurses drew up the lidocaine and handed it to Bellows . Bellows injected it into the I.V . line . Susan moved so that she could see the monitor screen more clearly . Despite the lidocaine , the rhythm rapidly deteriorated to senseless fibrillation once more . Bellows swore , Reid started massage , and the nurse recharged the defibrillator . " What the hell is going on here ? " queried Bellows , motioning for another amp of bicarbonate to be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing a purely rhetorical question . Another dose of epinephrine given I.V. , followed by a second defibrillation attempt , returned the rate to a semblance of normal . But premature contractions returned , despite additional lidocaine . " This has to be the same problem that they had in the OR , " said 82  | Bellows , watching the premature contractions increase in frequency until the rhythm dissolved into fibrillation . " You 're up again , Reid ole boy . Let 's go , team . " By 1:15 Nancy Greenly had been defibrillated twenty-one times . After each shock a relatively normal rhythm would return only to disintegrate into fibrillation after a short duration . At 1:16 the ICU phone rang . It was answered by the ward clerk , who took the information . It was the lab calling with the stat electrolyte values . Everything was normal except the potassium level . It was very low , only 2.8 milliequivalents per liter . The ward clerk handed the results to one of the nurses , who showed them to Bellows . " My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? At least we have an answer . OK , let 's get some potassium in her . Put 80 milliequivalents into that I.V . bottle and speed it up to 200 cc per hour . " Nancy Greenly responded to this command by immediately lapsing back into fibrillation for the twenty-second time . Reid started compression while Bellows readied the paddles . The potassium was added to the I.V . Susan was totally absorbed by the whole resuscitation procedure . In fact , her concentration had been so great that she had almost missed hearing her name crackle out of the page system speaker near the main desk . The page system had been intermittently active throughout the entire cardiac arrest procedure by calling out the names of physicians followed by an extension number . But the sound had blended and merged with the general background noise , and Susan had been oblivious to it . At least until her own name floated out into the room along with the extension 381 . Somewhat reluctantly Susan left her place by the wall and used the phone at the main desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extension of the recovery room and Susan was quite surprised to be paged from there . She gave her name as Susan Wheeler , not Dr. Susan Wheeler , and said that she had been paged . The clerk told her to hold the line . He returned immediately . " There 's an arterial blood gas to be drawn on a patient up here . " 83  | " Blood gas ? " " Right . Oxygen , carbon dioxide , and acid levels . And we need it stat . " " How did you get my name ? " asked Susan , twisting the cord on the phone . She hoped it was by some sort of mistake that she had been called . " I just do as I 'm told . Your name is on the chart . Remember it 's stat . " The line went dead . The clerk had hung up before Susan could respond again . Actually she had little else to say . She replaced the receiver and walked back to Nancy Greenly 's bedside . Bellows was repositioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , the arms ineffectually flopping across the chest . It seemed both dramatic and pitiful at the same time . The monitor showed a normal rhythm . " She 's got a good pulse , " said Cartwright at the groin . " I think she 's holding her sinus rhythm better now that some of the potassium has gotten into her system , " said Bellows , his eyes glued to the monitor screen . " Dr. Bellows , " said Susan during the lull in the action . " I got a call to draw an arterial blood gas on a patient in the recovery room . " " Enjoy yourself , " said Bellows , distracted . He turned to Shergood . " Where in heaven 's name are those medical residents ? God , when you need them they lie low . But just try to take someone to surgery and they hang around like a group of vultures , canceling your case because of a borderline serum porcelain . " Cartwright and Reid forced a laugh for political reasons . " You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never drawn an arterial blood gas . I 've never seen one drawn . " Bellows turned from the monitor to Susan . " Jesus Christ , as if I do n't have enough to worry about . It 's just like getting venous blood only you get it out of an artery . What the hell did you learn during the first two years of medical school ? " Susan felt a defensive surge ; her face reddened . " Do n't answer that , " added Bellows quickly . " Cartwright , head over with Susan and ... " " I 've got that thyroidectomy you put me on with Dr. Jacobs in five minutes , " interrupted Cartwright , looking at his watch . 84  | " Shit , " said Bellows . " OK , Dr. Wheeler , I 'll head over with you and show you how to do an arterial stick but not until things are reasonably quiet here . Things are looking a little better ; I 've got to admit that . " Bellows turned to Reid . " Send up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we are doing . Maybe we are out of the woods . " While she was waiting , Susan thought about Bellows 's last comment . He had used the pronoun we rather than saying that Nancy Greenly was out of the woods . It fit the pattern and she pondered about depersonalization . It also reminded her of Stark . He did n't seem to care for Bellows 's pronouns either . Monday February 23 1:35 P.M. " Some days are like this , " said Bellows , holding the door open for Susan as they left the ICU . " Lunch can be considered a luxury . Even a nice ... " Bellows paused as they walked down the corridor . They were both eyeing the floor . Bellows was searching for a word . Then he changed his incompleted sentence . " On occasion it is even hard to find time to relieve oneself . " " You meant to say a nice shit , ' did n't you ? " Bellows glanced at Susan . She looked up at him with a slight smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Susan . Bellows continued to study her face , which she carefully kept as neutral as possible . They walked in silence past the holding area for surgery . " As I mentioned before , an arterial stick is just about the same as a venous stick , " said Bellows , changing the subject . He sensed the unnerving effect Susan had on him and he sought to regain the upper hand . " You isolate the artery , either the brachial , radial , or femoral , it really does n't matter which , with your middle and index fingers , like this . . . " Bellows held up his left hand and extended his middle and 8S  | index fingers and pretended to palpate an artery in the air . " Once you have the artery between the fingers , you can feel the pulse . Then simply guide the needle in by feel . The best method is to let arterial pressure fill the syringe . In that way you can avoid air bubbles , which tend to distort the values . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique of the arterial stick . " Two important points : you have to use a heparinized syringe to keep the blood from clotting , and you have to keep pressure over the site for five minutes after the stick . The patient can get a frightful hematoma from an arterial stick if the pressure part is forgotten . " To Susan the recovery room seemed superficially similar to the ICU except that it was brighter , noisier , and more crowded . There were about fifteen to twenty spaces designated for beds . Each space had a complement of equipment built into the wall , including monitors , gas lines , and suction lines . Most of the spaces were occupied by high beds with the side rails pulled up . In each bed was a patient with fresh bandages over some part of his body . Bottles of intravenous fluid were clustered on the tops of poles , like some hideous fruit on leafless trees . New patients were arriving , others leaving , causing mini-traffic jams of moving beds . Conversation flowed freely from those who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even some occasional laughter . But there were also some groans , and a baby was wailing an unheeded lament in a crib by the nurses ' station . Some of the beds had groups of doctors and nurses busily engaged in adjusting the hundreds of lines , valves , and tubes . Some of the doctors were dressed in wrinkled scrub suits , stained with all sorts of secretions , although blood was the most prevalent . Others wore long white coats starched painfully stiff . It was a busy place , a crossroad filled with patients , charts , motion , and talk . Bellows was anxious to dispense with the task ahead and approached the main desk , which was strategically placed in the center of the large room . In response to his inquiry he was handed a tray with a heparinized syringe and directed to one of the recovery room beds to the left , opposite the door through which they had entered . 86  | " Why do n't I go ahead and do this one , and you do the next one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the bed . They could not see the patient because of the people standing in the way . There were several nurses on the left , two doctors in scrub suits at the foot , and a tall black doctor in a long white coat on the right . As Bellows and Susan drew near , it was obvious that the latter individual had been talking although at that moment he was adjusting the pressure setting on the respirator . Susan sensed the emotional climate instantly . Both of the doctors in scrub suits were obviously intensely concerned . The smaller individual , Dr. Goodman , was visibly shaking . The other , Dr. Spallek , had his mouth angrily set with clenched teeth , audibly breathing through his nostrils as if he were about to attack the next person in his path . " There 's got to be some sort of an explanation , " snarled the infuriated Spallek . He took hold of his face mask still tied around his neck and yanked it free , snapping the cord . He flung it to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he hissed before abruptly turning away and leaving . He collided with Bellows , who miraculously managed to juggle the small tray he was carrying without dropping any of its contents . There were no words of apology from Dr. Spallek . He crossed the recovery room and blasted open the doors to the hall . Bellows went directly to the left of the bed and put down the tray . Susan advanced warily , watching the expressions of the remaining people . The black doctor straightened up and his dark eyes followed the exit of the irate Dr. Spallek . Susan was immediately taken by the imposing image of the man . His tag gave his name : Dr. Robert Harris . He was tall , well over six feet , his dark hair textured into a restrained Afro . His blemishless tawny skin shone , and his face reflected a curious combination of culture and restrained violence . His movements were calm , almost to the point of deliberate slowness . As his ryes returned from watching Spallek 's exit they passed over Susan 's face before returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had noticed Susan , he gave no hint whatsoever . " What did you use for the pre-op , Norman ? " asked Harris ,  | pronouncing each word carefully . He had a cultured Texas accent if that were possible . " Innovar , " said Goodman . The pitch of his voice was abnormally high and cracking under the strain . Susan moved up to the foot of the bed where Spallek had been standing . She studied the crumpled man next to her , Dr. Goodman . He looked pale and his hair was matted with perspiration to his forehead . He had a prominent nose , which Susan saw in perfect profile . His deep-set eyes were riveted to the patient . He did not blink . Susan looked down at the patient , her eyes wandering to the wrist which Bellows was prepping for the arterial stick . With an exaggerated double-take , her eyes shot back to the face of the patient as recognition occurred . It was Berman ! In contrast to the tanned visage Susan recalled from their meeting in room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusky gray color . The skin was pulled taut over his cheekbones . An endotracheal tube protruded from the left side of his mouth and some dried secretion was crusted along his lower lip . His eyes were closed but not completely . His right leg was in a huge plaster cast . " Is he all right ? " blurted Susan looking from Harris to Goodman . " What happened ? " Susan spoke from emotion , without thinking ; she sensed something was wrong and she reacted impulsively . Bellows was surprised at her sudden questions and looked up from his work , holding the syringe in his right hand . Harris straightened up slowly and turned toward Susan . Goodman 's eyes did not stray . " Everything is absolutely perfect , " said Harris with a pronunciation suggesting an Oxford sojourn some time in his past . " Blood pressure , pulse , temperature all perfectly normal . However , he has apparently enjoyed his anesthetic slumber so much that he has decided not to wake up . " " Not another one , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to be saddled with another problem like Greenly . " What does the EEG look like ? " " You 'll be the first to know , " said Harris with a trace of sarcasm . " It 's been ordered . " Comprehension for Susan was delayed by emotion , for hope was 88  | momentarily stronger than reason . But eventually it flooded over her . " EEG ? " asked Susan apprehensively . " You mean he 's like the patient down in the ICU ? " Her eyes darted back and forth between Berman and Harris , then to Bellows . " Which patient is that ? " asked Harris , picking up the anesthesia record . " The D &C; mishap , " said Bellows . " You remember , about eight days ago , the twenty-three-year-old girl . " " Well I hope not , " said Harris , " but it 's beginning to look that way . " " What was the anesthesia ? " asked Bellows lifting Berman 's right eyelid and glancing down into the widely dilated pupil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The girl 's was halothane . If the problem is the same clinically , it was n't the anesthetic agent . " Harris looked up from the anesthesia record toward Goodman . " Why did you give this extra cc of Innovar toward the end of the case , Norman ? " Dr. Goodman did not respond immediately . Dr. Harris called his name again . " The patient seemed to be getting too light , " said Goodman , suddenly breaking his trance . " But why Innovar so late in the case ? Would n't fentanyl alone have been more prudent ? " " Probably . I should have used the fentanyl alone . The Innovar was just handy and I knew that I 'd only use an additional cc . " " Ca n't something be done ? " asked Susan with a hint of desperation . Images of Nancy Greenly streamed back with bits and pieces of the recent conversation with Berman . She could distinctly remember his vitality , which was in sharp contrast to the waxy , lifeless-appearing figure before her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Harris with finality , returning the anesthesia record to Goodman . " All we can do now is watch and see what kind of cerebral function returns , if any . The pupils are widely dilated and they do not react to light . That is not a good sign , to say the least . It probably means that there was extensive brain death . " Susan experienced a sickening feeling rise up within herself . She 89  | shuddered and the feeling passed but she felt light-headed . Above all , she felt helplessly desperate . " This is too much , " said Susan suddenly and with obvious emotion . Her voice quivered . " A normal healthy man with a minor peripheral problem ends up like a ... like a vegetable . My God , this ca n't go on . Two young people within just a couple of weeks . I mean , it 's an unacceptable risk . Why does n't the Chief of Anesthesia close the department ? Something 's got to be wrong . It 's absurd to allow ... " Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tirade . Then he interrupted her with an obvious edge to his voice . Bellows 's mouth had dropped open in total dismay . " I happen to be the Chief of Anesthesia , young lady . And who , may I ask , are you ? " Susan started to speak , but Bellows cut in nervously . " This is Susan Wheeler , Dr. Harris , a third-year medical student who is rotating on surgery , and , ah ... we just wanted to get this blood gas drawn here , then we 'll be off . " Bellows recommenced his prep on Berman 's right wrist , stroking rapidly with the Betadine sponge . " Miss Wheeler , " continued Harris in a condescending tone , " your emotionalism is out of place and frankly will not serve constructive purposes . What one needs in these cases is to establish a causal factor . I 've just mentioned to Dr. Bellows that the anesthetic agent was different in these two cases . The anesthetic care was unimpeachable save for a few minor debatable points . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of anesthesia and surgery . One needs to try to determine from these people if there is a way in order to forecast this kind of disastrous sequelae . To condemn anesthesia across the board and deprive the populace of needed surgery would be far worse than to accept a certain minimal risk involved in anesthesia . What ... " " Two cases in eight days is hardly a minimal risk , " interrupted Susan contentiously . Bellows tried to catch Susan 's eye to get her to break off with Harris , but Susan was staring directly at Harris , converting her emotionalism to defiance . " How many such cases have there been in the last year ? " asked Susan . 90  | Harris 's eyes scanned Susan 's face for several seconds before he responded . " 1 suddenly find this conversation somewhat akin to being cross-examined , and in that sense intolerable and unnecessary . " Without waiting for a response , Harris walked past Susan toward the recovery room door . Susan turned to face him . Bellows reached for her right arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She called after Harris , " Without wishing to sound impertinent , it does seem to me that some questions need to be asked by someone , and something done . " Harris stopped abruptly about ten feet from Susan and turned very slowly . Bellows shut his eyes tightly , as if he expected to receive a blow to the head . " And I suppose that someone should be a medical student ! For your information , in case you are planning to be our Socratic gadfly , there have been six cases prior to this present problem in the last few years . Now if I may have your permission , I will get back to work . " Harris turned again and started for the door . " I suppose your emotionalism serves constructive purposes , " called Susan . Bellows supported himself by leaning onto the bed . Harris stopped for the second time , but he did not turn around . Then he continued , and he too blasted open the door to the hall . Bellows put his left hand up to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying to do , commit medical suicide ? " Bellows reached out and turned Susan around to face him . " That was Robert Harris , Chief of Anesthesia . Christ ! " Bellows commenced the prep for the third time , rapidly , nervously . " You know , just being here with you when you act like that makes me look bad . Shit , Susan , why did you want to get him pissed ? " Bellows palpated the radial artery and then jammed the needle of the heparinized syringe into the skin on the thumb side of Berman 's wrist . " I 'm going to have to say something to Stark before he hears about it through the grapevine . Susan , I mean , what 's the point of getting him mad ? You obviously do n't have any idea what hospital politics are like . " Susan watched Bellows performing the arterial stick . She consciously avoided looking at Berman 's sickly face . The syringe began to fill with blood spontaneously . The blood was a very bright crimson . 91  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think I was impertinent until that last question , and he deserved that . " Bellows did n't answer . " Anyway I really did n't want to make him angry . . . well , maybe I did in a way . " Susan thought for a few moments . " You see , I talked with this patient only an hour or so ago . He was the patient I had to leave the ICU for . It 's just so unbelievable ; he was a functioning , normal human being . And ... I ... we had a conversation and I felt like I knew something about him . I even took a liking to him in a way . That 's what makes me mad or sad or both . And Harris , his attitude made it worse . " Bellows did n't respond immediately . He searched in the tray for a syringe cap . " Do n't tell me anymore , " he said at length . " 1 do n't want to hear about it . Here , hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he prepared the ice bed . " Susan , I 'm afraid you 're going to be poison for me around here . You have no idea how miserable someone like Harris can make it . Here , put pressure on the puncture site . " " Mark ? " said Susan pressing on Berman 's wrist but looking at Bellows directly . " You do n't mind if I call you Mark , do you ? " Bellows took the syringe and placed it into the ice bath . " I 'm not sure , to be perfectly honest . " " Well , anyway , Mark , you have to admit that six , and maybe seven , cases , if Berman proves to be like Greenly , represents a lot of cases of brain death , or vegetables , as you call them . " " But a lot of surgery goes on here , Susan . It 's often more than a hundred cases a day , some twenty-five thousand per year . That drops the six cases below some two hundredths of one percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That may be true , but these six cases represent only one type of possible complication , not surgical-anesthesia risk in general . Mark , it 's got to be too high . In fact , down in the ICU this morning you said that the particular complication Nancy Greenly represented occurred only about one in a hundred thousand . Now you 're trying to tell me that six in twenty-five thousand is OK . Bullshit . It 's too high whether you or Harris or anybody in the hospital accept it . I mean would you want to 92  | have some minor surgery tomorrow with that kind of risk ? You know this whole thing really bothers me , the more I think about it . " " Well then , do n't think about it . Come on , we 've got to get moving . " " Wait a minute . You know what I 'm going to do ? " " I ca n't guess and I 'm not sure I want to know . " " I 'm going to look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for some reasonable conclusions . I do have a thirdyear paper to do and I think I owe that much to Sean here . " " Oh for Christ sake , Susan , let 's not be melodramatic . " " I 'm not being melodramatic . I think I 'm responding to a challenge . Sean challenged me earlier with my image of myself as a doctor . I failed . I was n't detached or professional . You might even say I acted like a schoolgirl . Now I 'm challenged again . But this time intellectually with a problem , a serious problem . Maybe I can respond to this challenge in a more commendable fashion . Maybe these cases represent a new symptom complex or disease process . Maybe they represent a new complication of anesthesia because of some peculiar susceptibility these people had from some previous insult which they suffered in the past . " " All the more power to you , " said Bellows getting the remains from the arterial stick together . " Frankly though , it sounds like a hell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment problem of your own . Besides , I think you 'll be wasting your time . I told you before that Dr. Billing , the anesthesiology resident on Greenly 's case , went over it with a fine-toothed comb . And believe me , he 's bright . He said that there was absolutely no explanation for what happened . " " Your support is appreciated , " said Susan . " I 'll start with your patient in the ICU . " " Just a minute , Susan dear . I want to make one point crystal clear . " Bellows held up his index and middle finger like Nixon 's victory sign . " With Harris on the rag , I do n't want to be involved , no how . Understood ? If you 're crazy enough to want to get involved , it 's your bag from A to Z. " " Mark , you sound like an invertebrate . " 93  | " I just happen to be aware of hospital realities and I want to be a surgeon . Susan looked Mark directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutshell , is probably your tragic flaw . " Monday February 23 1:53 P.M. The cafeteria at the Memorial could have been in any one of a thousand hospitals . The walls were a drab yellow that tended toward mustard . The ceiling was constructed of a low-grade acoustical tile . The steam table was a long L-shaped affair with brown , stained trays stacked at the beginning . The excellence of the Memorial 's clinical services did not extend into the food service . The first food seen by an unlucky customer coming into the cafeteria was the salad , the lettuce invariably as crisp as wet Kleenex . To heighten the disagreeable effect , the salads were stacked one on top of the other . The steam table itself presented the hot selections , which posed a baffling mystery . So many things tasted alike that they were indistinguishable . Only carrots and corn stood aside . The carrots had their own disagreeable taste ; the corn had absolutely no taste at all . By quarter to two in the afternoon , the cafeteria was almost empty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resting after the mad lunchtime rush . As bad as the food was , the cafeteria was still heavily patronized because it enjoyed a monopoly . Few people in the hospital complex took more than thirty minutes for lunch , and there simply was not enough time to go elsewhere . Susan took a salad but after one look at the limp lettuce , she replaced it . Bellows went directly to the sandwich area and took one . 94  | " There 's not much they can do to a tuna sandwich , " he called back to Susan . Susan eyed the hot entrees and moved on . Following Bellows 's lead , she selected a tuna sandwich . The woman who was supposed to be at the cash register was nowhere to be seen . " Come on , " motioned Bellows , " we ai n't got much time . " Feeling a bit like a shoplifter by not paying , Susan followed Bellows to a table and sat down . The sandwich was repellent . Somehow too much water had gotten into the tunafish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and Susan was famished . " We 've got a lecture at two , " garbled Bellows through a huge bite of sandwich . " So eat hearty . " " Mark ? " " Yeah ? " said Bellows as he gulped half his milk in one swig . It was apparent that Bellows was a speed eater of Olympic caliber . " Mark , you would n't be hurt if I cut your first surgery lecture , would you ? " Susan had a twinkle in her eye . Bellows stopped the second half of his tuna sandwich midway to his mouth and regarded Susan . He had an idea that she was flirting with him , but he dismissed it . " Hurt ? No , why do you ask ? " Bellows had a helpless feeling that he was being manipulated . " Well I just do n't think I could sit through a lecture at this moment in time , " said Susan , opening her milk carton . " I 'm a little spaced from this affair with Berman . . . . Affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptight ; I could n't handle a lecture . If I do something active 1 ' 11 he much better off . I was thinking that I 'd go to the library and look up something about anesthesia complications . It will give me a chance to start my little ' investigation as well as sort out this morning in my mind . " " Would you like to talk about it ? " asked Bellows . " No , I 'll be OK , really . " Susan was surprised and touched by his sudden warmth . " The lecture is n't critical . It 's an introductory kind of thing by one 95  | of the emeritus professors . Afterwards I planned for you students to come on the ward to meet your patients . " " Mark ? " " What ? " " Thanks . " Susan stood up , smiled at Bellows , and left . Bellows put the second half of his tuna sandwich into his mouth and chewed it on the right side , then he moved it over to the left cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . He watched her cross the cafeteria and deposit her tray in the rack . She rescued her unfinished milk and sandwich before leaving . At the door she turned and waved . Bellows waved in return but by the time he got his hand up , she had already disappeared . Bellows looked around self-consciously , wondering if anyone had noticed him with his hand in the air . Replacing his hand on the table , he thought about Susan . He had to admit that she attracted him in a refreshing , basic way , reminding him of the way he felt early in his social career : an excitement , an unsettling impatience . His imagination conjured up sudden romantic pursuits with Susan as the object . But as soon as he did so , he reprimanded himself for being juvenile . Bellows polished off his milk with another gigantic gulp while carrying his tray to the dirty-dish cart . En route he wondered if he dared to ask Susan out . There were two problems . One was the residency and Stark . Bellows had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents dating a student assigned to him . Bellows was not sure if such a worry was rational or not . He did know that Stark tended to favor married residents . The idea was that the married ones would be more dependable , which , as far as Bellows was concerned , was pure bunk . But there was little hope of keeping a relationship between himself and one of the students a secret . Stark would find out and it could be bad . The second problem was Susan herself . She was sharp ; there was no question about that . But could she be warm ? Bellows had no idea . Maybe she was just too busy , or too intellectualized , or too ambitious . The last thing that Bellows wanted to do was to squander his limited free time on some cold , castrating bitch . And what about himself ? Could Bellows handle a sharp girl who 96  | was in his own field even if she were warm and lovable ? He had dated a few nurses , but that was different because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never dated another doctor or even doctor-to-be . Somehow the idea was a bit disturbing . Leaving the cafeteria , Susan enjoyed a greater sense of direction than she had felt all day . Although she had no idea how she was actually going to investigate the problem of prolonged coma after anesthesia , she felt that it represented an intellectual challenge which could be met by applying scientific methods and reasoning . For the first time all day she had a feeling that the first two years of medical school had meant something . Her sources were to be the literature in the library and the charts of the patients , particularly Greenly 's and Berman 's . Near to the cafeteria was the hospital gift shop . It was a pleasant place , populated and run by an assortment of gracefully aging suburbanite women dressed in cute pink smocks . The windows of the shop faced the main hospital corridor and were mullioned , giving the shop an appearance of a cottage smack dab in the middle of the busy hospital . Susan entered the gift shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looseleaf notebook . She slipped the purchase into her pocket of her white coat and left for the ICU . Her jumping-off point would be the case of Nancy Greenly . The ICU was back to its pre-arrest hush . The harsh illumination had been dampened to the level Susan recalled from her first visit . The instant the heavy door closed behind her , Susan tasted the same anxiety she had noted before , the same feeling of incompetence . Again she wanted to leave before something happened and she was asked the simplest of questions to which she would undoubtedly have to answer a demoralizing " 1 do n't know . " But she did not bolt . Now she at least had something to do which gave her a modicum of confidence . She wanted the chart of Nancy Greenly . Looking to the left , Susan noticed that no one was standing by Nancy Greenly 's bed . The potassium level had apparently been rectified and the heart was beating normally once again . The crisis over , Nancy Greenly was forgotten and allowed to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigil over her vegetablelike functions . Drawn by an irresistible curiosity , Susan walked over to Nancy Greenly 's side . She had to struggle to keep her emotions in check and to keep the identification transference to a minimum . Looking down at Nancy Greenly , it was difficult for Susan to comprehend that she was looking at a brainless shell rather than a sleeping human being . She wanted to reach out and gently shake Nancy 's shoulder so that she would awaken so that they could talk . Instead , Susan reached out and picked up Nancy 's wrist . Susan noted the delicate pallor of the hand as it drooped , lifelessly . Nancy was totally paralyzed , completely limp . Susan began to think about paralysis from destruction of the brain . The reflex circuits from the periphery would still be intact , at least to some degree . Susan grasped Nancy 's hand as if she were shaking it and slowly flexed and extended the wrist . There was no resistance . Then Susan flexed the wrist forcefully to its limit , the fingers almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant but nonetheless definite . Susan tried it with the other wrist ; it was the same . So Nancy Greenly was not totally flaccid . Susan felt a certain sense of academic pleasure ; the irrational joy of the positive finding . Susan found a percussion hammer for tendon reflexes . It was made of hard red rubber with a stainless steel handle . She had had one used on herself and had tried one on fellow students in physical diagnosis classes , but never used one on a patient . Clumsily Susan tried to elicit a reflex by tapping Nancy Greenly 's right wrist . Nothing . But Susan was not exactly sure where to tap . Instead she pulled up the sheet on the right side and tapped under the knee . Nothing . She flexed the knee with her left hand and tapped again . Still nothing . From neuroanatomy class Susan remembered that the reflex she was searching for came from a sudden stretch of the tendon . So she stretched Nancy Greenly 's knee more , then tapped . The thigh muscle contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflex that was no more than a slight tightening of the flaccid muscle . Susan tried it on the left leg , with the same result . Nancy Greenly had weak but definite reflexes , and they were symmetrical . 98  | Susan tried to think of other parts of the neurological examination . She remembered level-of-consciousness testing . In Nancy Greenly 's case the only test would be reaction to pain stimulus . Yet when she pinched Nancy Greenly 's Achilles tendon , there was no response no matter how hard she squeezed . Without any specific reason other than wondering if the pain sensation would be more potent the closer to the brain , Susan pinched Nancy Greenly 's thigh and then recoiled in horror . Susan thought that Nancy Greenly was getting up because her body stiffened , arms straightening from her sides and rotating inward in a painful contraction . There was a side-to-side chewing motion with her jaw almost as if she were awakening . But it passed and Nancy Greenly reverted to her limpness equally suddenly . Eyes widening , Susan had moved back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she had done or how she had managed to do it . But she knew she was toying in the area well beyond her present abilities and knowledge . Nancy Greenly had had a seizure of some kind , and Susan was immensely thankful that it had passed so quickly . Guiltily , Susan glanced around the room to see if anyone was watching . She was relieved to note that no one was . She was also relieved that the cardiac monitor above Nancy Greenly continued its steady and normal pace . There were no premature contractions . Susan had the uncomfortable feeling that she was doing something wrong , that she was trespassing , and that any moment she would be deservedly reprimanded , perhaps by Nancy Greenly 's arresting once again . Susan quickly decided that she would withhold further patient examination until after some serious reading . With great effort at appearing nonchalant , Susan made her way over to the central desk . The charts were kept in a circular stainless steel file built into the counter top . With her left hand she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susan turned it more slowly . The squeak persisted . " Can I help you ? " asked June Shergood from behind Susan , causing her to start and to withdraw her hand as if she were a child caught at the cookie jar . " I 'd just like the chart , " said Susan , expecting some sour words from the nurse . 99  | " What chart ? " Shergood 's voice was pleasant . " Nancy Greenly 's . I 'm going to try to get an idea about her case so that I can participate in her care . " June Shergood rummaged among the charts , coming up with Nancy Greenly 's . " You might find it easier to concentrate in there , " said Shergood with a smile , pointing toward a door . Susan thanked her , welcoming the opportunity to withdraw . The door that Shergood had indicated opened into a tiny room ringed about with glass-faced , locked medicine cabinets . A counter top ran around three sides of the room , providing desk space . On the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the omnipresent coffeepot . Susan sat down with the chart . Although Nancy Greenly had not been in the hospital for even two weeks , her chart was voluminous . That was usual for a case placed in the ICU . The elaborate , constant care generated reams of paper . Susan took out the remains of her tuna sandwich and milk and poured herself a cup of coffee . Then she took out her notebook and removed a number of blank pages . She started to work . Unaccustomed to using a patient chart , she spent a few minutes figuring out its organization . The order sheets were first , followed by the graphs of the patient 's vital signs . Next was the history and physical examination dictated on the day of admission . The rest of the chart included the progress notes , the operative and anesthesia notes , the nurses ' notes , and the innumerable laboratory values , X-ray reports , and records of sundry tests and procedures . Since she did not know what she was looking for , Susan decided to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of determining what was going to be the important information . She started with Nancy Greenly 's name , age , sex , and race . Next she included the meager medical history attesting to the fact that Nancy Greenly had been a healthy individual . There were bits and pieces of family history , including reference to a grandmother who had had a stroke . The only illness of note in Nancy 's past was a case of mononucleosis at age 18 , with an apparently uneventful recovery . The review of Nancy 's systems , including her cardiovascular and respiratory systems , were normal . Susan wrote down the laboratory values from her routine pre-op screen : the blood and urine were both normal . 100  | She also wrote down the results of the pregnancy test , negative ; various blood clotting studies , blood type , tissue type , chest X-ray , and EKG . There was also the chemistry profile , which included a wide battery of tests . Nancy Greenly 's reports were well within normal limits . Susan ate the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . Turning the pages of the operative section and locating the anesthesia record , she noted the pre-op medication : Demerol and Phenergan given at 6:45 A.M. by , one of the nurses on Beard 5 . The endotracheal tube was a number 8 . Pentothal 2 grams given I.V . at 7:24 A.M. Halothane , nitrous oxide , and oxygen started at 7:25 . The halothane concentration was initially 2 percent through the Fluotec Temperature Compensated Vaporizer . Within several minutes it was reduced to 1 percent . The nitrous oxide and oxygen flow rates were 3 liters and 2 liters per minute respectively . For muscle relaxation a 2 cc dose of 0.2 percent succinylcholine was given at 7:26 and a second dose at 7:40 . Susan noted that the blood pressure fell at 7:48 after maintaining a plateau of 105/75 . The halothane percentage was reduced to 1/2 percent at that point , while the nitrous oxide and oxygen flow was changed to 2 and 3 liters . The blood pressure drifted back up to 100/ 60 . Susan made a rough copy of the information which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that point on the anesthesia record became hard to decipher . As far as Susan could tell , the blood pressure and the pulse stayed about 100/60 and seventy per minute respectively . Although the heart rate stayed stable , there was some sort of variation in the rhythm , but Dr. Billing had not described it . From the record Susan could see that Nancy Greenly had been moved from the OR into the recovery room at 8:51 . A Block Ade square-wave nerve stimulator had been used to test the function of Nancy 's peripheral nerves . It had been originally suspected that she had been unable to metabolize the additional dose of succinylcholine . But nerve function had been detected in both ulnar nerves , meaning that the problem was most likely central , in the brain . Over the following hour Nancy Greenly had been given Narcan 4 mg to rule out an idiosyncratic hypersusceptibility to her pre-op narcotic . There had been no response . At 9:15 she had been given neostigmine 2.5 mg to see if the block on her nerves and hence her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the nerve stimulator test . Nancy Greenly had also been given two units of fresh frozen plasma with documented cholinesterase activity to try to eliminate any succinylcholine that might have still remained . Both these measures resulted in some mild twitching of a few muscles but no real response . The anesthesia record ended with the terse statement in Dr. Billing 's handwriting : " Delayed return of consciousness post anesthesia ; cause unknown . " Susan next turned to the operative report dictated by Dr. Major . DATE : February 14 , 1976 PRE OP DIAGNOSIS : Dysfunctional uterine bleeding POST OP DIAGNOSIS : Same SURGEON : Dr. Major ANESTHESIA : General endotracheal using halothane ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS : 500 cc COMPLICATIONS : Prolonged return to consciousness after the termination of anesthesia PROCEDURE : After appropriate pre-op medication ( Demerol and Phenergan ) the patient was brought to the operating room and attached to the cardiac monitor . She was smoothly inducted under general anesthesia utilizing an 102  | endotracheal tube . The perineum was prepped and draped in the usual fashion . A bimanual examination was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A #4 Pederson speculum was inserted into the vagina and secured . Blood clots were sucked from the vaginal vault . The cervix was inspected and appeared normal . The uterus was sounded to 5 cm with a Simpson sound . Cervical dilation was carried out with ease and minimal trauma . Cervical dilators # I through #4 were passed with ease . A # 3 Sime curette was passed and the endometrium was curetted . A specimen was sent to the laboratory . Bleeding was minimal at the termination of the procedure . The speculum was removed . At that point it became apparent that the patient was making a slow recovery from anesthesia . Susan rested her weary right hand by letting it dangle by her side . She had a habit of writing by holding a pencil or pen so tightly that blood flow was restricted . The blood tingled as it returned to her fingertips . Before going back to work , she took several sips of her coffee . The pathology report described the endometrial scrapings as proliferative in character . The diagnosis was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No clue there . Next Susan turned to the most interesting page : the initial neurology consult , signed by a Dr. Carol Harvey . Without knowing the meaning of most of what she wrote , Susan copied the consult note as well as she could . The handwriting was atrocious . HISTORY : The patient is a twenty-three-year-old , white female admitted to the hospital with a problem of ( illegible phrase ) . Past medical history of self and family negative for significant neurological disorders . Patient 's pre-op workup ( illegible phrase ) . Surgery itself uneventful and immediate result diagnostic and most likely curative of the presenting complaint . However , during surgery some minor problems with the blood pressure were noted , and after surgery there was noted a prolonged unconsciousness and apparent paralysis . Overdose of succinylcholine and/or halothane ruled out . ( Entire sentence totally illegible . ) EXAMINATION : Patient in deep coma unresponsive to spoken word , light touch or deep pain . Patient appears to be paralyzed although trace deep tendon reflexes elicited from both biceps and quadriceps symmetrically . Muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No tremor . 103  | Cranial nerves : ( illegible phrase ) ... pupils dilated and unresponsive . Absent corneal reflex . Square-Wave Nerve Stimulator : Persistent although decreased function of the peripheral nerves . Cerebral Spinal Fluid ( CSF ) : Atraumatic puncture , clear fluid , opening pressure 125 mm of water .

( illegible phrase ) . . . coma due to diffuse cerebral edema is the primary diagnosis . The possibility of a cerebral vascular accident or stroke can not be ruled out without cerebral angiography . An idiosyncratic response to any of the agents used for anesthesia remains a possibility although I believe .. . ( illegible phrase ) . Pneumoencephalography and/or a CAT scan may be of help but I believe it would be of academic interest only and would not provide any additional information for diagnosis in this difficult case . The EEG with its suppression of all organized and otherwise activity certainly suggests extensive brain death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquilizer/alcohol combinations but it is extremely rare . There are only three cases in the literature . Whatever the cause , this patient has suffered an acute insult to the brain . There is no chance that this patient represents any degenerative neurological syndrome . Thank you very much for letting me see this very interesting patient . DR . CAROL HARVEY , resident , neurology Susan cursed the handwriting as she surveyed the many blanks on her own notebook sheet . She took another sip of coffee and turned the page in the chart . On the next page was another note from Dr. Harvey . February 15 , 1975 . Follow up by Neurology . Patient status = unchanged . Repeat EEG = no electrical activity . CSF laboratory values were all within normal limits . IMPRESSION : I have discussed this case with my attending and with the other neurology residents who agree on the diagnosis of acute brain insult leading to brain death . It is also the general consensus that cerebral edema from acute hypoxia was the immediate cause of the problem . The cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps due to a transient blood clot , platelet clot , fibrin clot , or other embolus related to 104  | the endometrial scraping . Some sort of acute idiopathic polyneuritis or vasculitis may have played a part . Two papers of interest are : " Acute Idiopathic Polyneuritis ; a Report of Three Cases , " Australian Journal of Neurology , volume 13 , Sept. 1973 , pp 98-101 . " Prolonged Coma and Brain Death Following Ingestion of Sleeping Pills by Eighteen Year Old Female , " New England Journal of Neurology , volume 73 , July 1974 , pp 301-302 . Cerebral angiography , pneumoencephalography , and a CAT scan can be done , but it is the combined opinion that the results would be normal . Thank you very much DR . CAROL HARVEY Susan let her aching hand rest for a few moments after copying the lengthy neurology notes . She moved on in the chart , passing the nurses ' notes until she reached the laboratory results . There were numerous X-ray reports , including a normal series of skull X-rays . Next came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her notebook pages . Since all the results were essentially normal , Susan concentrated on finding out if there were any changes between the pre-op values and the post-op values . There was only one value that fell into this category ; after the operation Nancy Greenly had exhibited a higher serum sugar as if she had developed a diabetic tendency . The serial EKGs were not very revealing , although they did show some nonspecific S and ST wave changes following the D &C.; However , there was no pre-op EKG to compare . Finishing , Susan closed the cover of the chart and leaned back , stretching her hands up toward the ceiling . At the very limit of her stretch , she grunted and exhaled . She leaned forward and glanced over the eight pages of minute handwriting which she had just completed . She felt no further in her investigation but she did not expect to . Much of what she had copied she really did not understand . Susan believed in the scientific method and she believed in the power of books and knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not know very much about clinical medicine , she had the positive feeling that by combining method with 105  | information she could solve the problem at hand why had Nancy Greenly lapsed into coma . First she had to gather as much observational data as possible ; that was the purpose of the charts . Next she had to understand the data ; for that she must turn to the literature . Analysis leading to synthesis : pure Cartesian magic . Susan was optimistic at this stage . And it did not faze her that she did not understand much of the material she had taken from Nancy Greenly 's chart . She felt confident that within the maze of information were critical points which could lead her to the solution . But to see it Susan needed more information , a lot more . The hospital medical library was on the second floor of the Harding building . After multiple false starts Susan was directed to a flight of stairs which led up to the personnel office , and past it , to the library itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Susan entered she passed a small daguerreotype of a matronly woman dressed in black . A copper plaque on the frame was engraved : In fond memory of Nancy Darling . Susan thought the name Nancy Darling , with its amorous connotations , hardly fitted the prim scowling figure . But it was New England one hundred percent . With the reassuring warmth of the books about her , Susan felt instantly at home in the library , in sharp contrast to her feelings in the ICU and the hospital in general . She put down her notebook and got her bearings . The center of the room , with its two-storied ceiling , had large oak tables with black academic colonial-style chairs . The end of the room was dominated by a large window that reached up to the ceiling , giving out onto the small inner courtyard of the hospital , which contained a patch of anemic grass , a single leafless tree , and a tennis court . The net on the tennis court sagged sadly from midwinter disuse . Bookshelves flanked both sides of the tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room . There was a cast-iron circular staircase which led up to the balcony . On that level the shelves to the right contained books , while bound periodicals were in stacks to the left . Against the wall opposite the window stood the dark mahogany card catalogue .  | Consulting the card catalogue , Susan searched out the books on anesthesiology . Once in the proper area , she went from book to book . She knew next to nothing about anesthesiology and needed a good introductory text . Specifically she was interested in anesthetic complications . She picked out five books , the most promising of which was titled Anesthetic Complications : Recognition and Management . As she was carrying the books over to the table where she had placed her notebook , her name came over the page system , gently subdued , distinctly followed by the number 482 . Susan let the books slide from her hands onto the table . She turned and eyed the phone . Then she turned back to the table and looked down at the books and her notebook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairs , Susan vacillated . She felt torn between her strongly reinforced compulsion to do as she was told and her newly discovered challenge , the problem of prolonged coma after anesthesia . It was not an easy choice . Following the accepted pathways had served her well in the past . She owed her current position to that . And that position was particularly important for Susan because of her sex . All of the females in medicine tended to follow a rather conservative road simply because they were a minority and hence had the feeling that they were constantly on trial . But then Susan thought about Nancy Greenly in the ICU and Sean Berman in the recovery room . She did n't think about them as patients but rather as people . She thought about their personal tragedies . Then she knew what she had to do . Medicine had already forced her to make many compromises . This time she was going to do what she thought was right , at least for a couple of intensive days . " Screw 482 , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down deliberately and cracked the book on anesthetic complications . The more she thought about Greenly and Berman , the more convinced she was that she was doing the right thing . 106 107  | Monday February 23 2:45 P.M. Bellows impatiently tapped the top of the extension telephone No. 482 , expecting it to ring any second . He was going to answer it before the first ring was completed . In the background the droning voice of the aging professor emeritus , Dr. Allen Druery , could be heard , extolling the virtues of Halstead . The four students appeared lost within the emptiness of the surgical conference room . Bellows had originally thought that the atmosphere of the conference room would add a positive note to the lectures he had planned for the students . But now he was n't so sure . The room was too big , too cold for four students , and the lecturer looked a bit ludicrous standing at the podium and facing tier after tier of empty seats . From where Bellows was sitting , he could see only the backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a furious fashion , getting every word . Dr. Druery 's lecture was mildly interesting but certainly not worth notetaking . Bellows knew the syndrome , though . He 'd seen it in action a thousand times and even suffered from it to an extent himself . As soon as the lights would dim , and someone would start speaking , many medical students would respond in a Pavlovian fashion by taking notes , madly trying to get every word down onto paper without any thought as to the content . The medical student responded in this utterly unintellectual way because , more often than not , he was asked to regurgitate whatever trivia he had been fed . Bellows was sorry he had not told Susan that he indeed would be hurt if she missed the lecture . In such a small group , her absence was painfully apparent above and beyond the fact that she was so visually distinctive . Bellows was nervous that Stark would decide to pop in and welcome the group . Of course he 'd wonder where the fifth student was , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was scrubbing on a case . But so early in the game , that was unlikely . The worry about Stark had finally caused Bellows to page Susan so that he could retract his previous silent acquiescence to her cutting the lecture . It was a bad precedent to establish . So he thought he would 108  | just inform her that she was sincerely missed and should get herself up to the tenth-floor conference room on the double . Bellows specifically decided to use the word sincerely because in the context it was used , it had several implications . Bellows had made up his mind to ask Susan out on a date . There were several unanswerable questions and aspects involved in such a move , yet the payoff was worth the risk . Susan was bright and spirited , and Bellows was almost positive she had a dynamite figure . Whether she could be feminine and warm according to Bellows 's interpretations of those qualities remained to be seen . The trouble was that Bellows had some pretty outdated notions about femininity . For him surgery and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's definition of femininity concerned availability . He expected his female friends to respect his schedule as much as he did and to rearrange their schedules to accord with it . An interesting aspect of Susan 's situation , it occurred to Bellows , was that for the next month or so , they would have similar schedules . That was encouraging . And if all else failed , Bellows reasoned that at least Susan would be a damn interesting screw . But the phone remained silent under Bellows 's expectant hand . Impatiently he redialed the page operator and told her to repeat the page for Dr. Susan Wheeler for 482 . Replacing the receiver , he again waited for the ring as the minutes slid by . Bellows began to think that maybe things would not go so smoothly with Susan . Perhaps she would n't even go out with him . She could already be tight with someone else . Under his breath he cursed females in general , and he told himself that he should be sensible and leave well enough alone . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competition . He also visualized that curve of Susan 's low back as it spread out over her ass . He decided to page once more . Gerald Kelley was as Irish as one could be and still live in Boston and not Dublin . His hair was reddish blond and thick and curly despite the fact that he was fifty-four years old . His face had a ruddy hue , almost as if he wore theatrical makeup , especially over the crests of his cheekbones . Kelley 's most notable feature and by far the dominant aspect of his 109  | profile was his enormous paunch . Every night three bottles of stout contributed to its awe-inspiring dimensions . For the last few years it had been pointed out that when Kelley was vertical , his belt buckle was horizontal . Gerald Kelley had worked for the Memorial since he was fifteen years old . He had started out in the maintenance department , the boiler room to be exact , and now he was in charge . From his long experience and mechanical aptitude he knew the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew almost all the mechanical aspects of the building by heart . It was for this reason that he was in charge and also why he was paid $13,700 a year . The hospital administration knew he was indispensable , and they would have paid more if Gerald Kelley had made an issue of it . The fact was , each party was satisfied . Gerald Kelley sat at his desk in the machinery spaces of the basement , thumbing through work orders . He had a day crew of eight men , and he tried to distribute the work according to need and capability . Any work on the power plant itself , though , Kelley did himself . The work orders in front of him were all routine , including the drain in the nurses ' station on the fourteenth floor . That plugged up on schedule , once per week . Placing the work orders in the sequence he felt they should be done , Kelley began to match them up with his crew . Although the general din in the machinery spaces was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , Kelley 's ears were sensitive to the character of the mixed sounds . Thus when the clank of metal on metal reached his ears from the direction of the main electrical panel , he turned his head . Most people would not have heard the sound amid all the other mechanical noises . However , it did not repeat itself and Kelley returned to his administrative job at hand . He did not like the paperwork attached to his position ; he would have preferred to fix the sink on the fourteenth floor himself . Yet he also understood that organization was a necessity if he were to keep things running . There was no way he could attend to every repair himself . The clank recurred , louder than before . Kelley turned again and surveyed the area near the electrical panel , behind the main boilers . He returned to his papers but found himself staring ahead , trying to 110  | understand what could have caused the kind of sound he had heard . It had a sharp , brief metallic resonance foreign to the indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and he wandered over to the main boiler . To get near to the electrical panel situated next to the main chase , which contained all the piping rising up in the building , he had to go around the boiler in either direction . He chose to go right , which gave him an opportunity to check the gauges on the boiler . This was an unnecessary maneuver because the system had been fully automated with backup safety devices and automatic cutoff switches . But it was an instinctive move for Kelley , having originated in the days when the boiler had to be watched minute by minute . So as he rounded the boiler his eyes were on the system , his mind appreciating its marvelous compactness compared to the system when he had started at the Memorial . When he looked ahead toward the electrical panel , he froze in his tracks , his right arm lifted involuntarily in self-defense . " God , you scared the life out of me , " said Kelley , catching his breath and allowing his arm to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said a slim man dressed in a khaki uniform . The shirt was open at the neck , and the man wore a white crew neck t-shirt which reminded Kelley of navy chiefs during his wartime duty . The man 's left breast pocket bulged with pens , small screwdrivers , and a ruler . Above the pocket was embroidered " Liquid Oxygen , Inc . " " I had no idea anyone else was in here , " said Kelley . " Same with me , " said the man in khaki . The two men looked at each other for a moment . The man in khaki was carrying a small green cylinder of compressed gas . A flow meter was attached to the cylinder head . " Oxygen " was stenciled plainly on the side . " My name is Darell , " said the man in khaki . " John Darell . Sorry to have scared you . I 've been checking the oxygen lines out to the central storage tank . Everything seems fine . In fact , I 'm on my way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . Through those swinging doors , up the stairway to the main hall . Then you have a choice . Nashua Street is to the right , Causeway Street to the left . " 111  | " Thanks a million , " said Darell , heading for the door . Kelley watched him leave , and then looked around in disbelief . He could n't figure how Darell had managed to get where he had been without being noticed . Kelley had no idea he could get so absorbed in his Goddamn paperwork . Kelley walked back to his desk and returned to work . After a few minutes he thought of something else that bothered him . There were no oxygen lines in the boiler room . Kelley made a mental note to ask Peter Barker , assistant administrator , about oxygen line checks . The trouble was that Kelley had a poor memory for everything except mechanical details . Monday February 23 3:36 P.M. With the cloud cover Boston had enjoyed little daylight that day , and by 3:30 dusk settled over the city . It took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone the same six-thousand-degree fiery star which in summer turned the macadam on Boylston Street molten . The temperature had responded to the surrendering sun by precipitously falling to nineteen degrees . Another flurry of minute crystalline bodies wafted over the city . The outside lights along the hospital walkways had been on for almost a half-hour . From within the illuminated library , it already appeared pitch black outside . The two-story window at the end of the room responded to the dropping temperature by starting an active convection current of cold air across its face . The weighted colder air fell to the floor at the foot of the window and then swept the length of the room under the tables toward the hissing radiators in the back . It was the cold current which first began to nudge Susan from the depths of her intense concentration . As with so many academic subjects , Susan began to perceive that the more she read about coma , the less she felt she knew . To her 112  | surprise , it was an enormous subject , spanning many disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was Susan 's realization that it was not known what determined consciousness , other than saying that the individual was not unconscious . The definition of one consisted of being the opposite of the other . Such a tautologous circle was a travesty of logic until Susan accepted the fact that medical science had not advanced enough to define consciousness precisely . In fact , being fully conscious and being totally unconscious ( coma ) seemed to represent opposite ends of a continuous spectrum which included partway states like confusion and stupor . Hence the inexact , unscientific terms were more an admission of ignorance than poorly conceived definitions . Despite the semantics Susan was well aware of the stark difference between normal consciousness and coma . She had observed both states that very day in a patient . . . Berman . And despite the lack of precision in definition , there was no lack of information regarding coma . Under the heading of " acute coma , " Susan began to fill page after page in her notebook with her characteristically small handwriting . Her particular interest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular aspect of brain function had to be disrupted , Susan had to be content with precipitating factors . Being interested in acute coma , or coma of sudden onset , also helped to narrow the field but still the list was impressive and growing . Susan looked back over the list of causes that she had noted so far : Trauma = concussion , contusion , or any type of stroke Hypoxia = low oxygen : ( 1 ) mechanical strangulation blocked airway insufficient ventilation ( 2 ) lung abnormality alveolar block ( 3 ) vascular block blood can not get to brain ( 4 ) cellular block of oxygen use 113  | High Carbon Dioxide Hyper ( hypo ) Glycemia = high ( low ) blood sugar Acidosis = high acid in the blood Uremia = kidney failure with high uric acid in the blood Hyper ( hypo ) Kalemia = high ( low ) potassium Hyper ( hypo ) Natremia = high ( low ) sodium Hepatic Failure = increase of toxins which would normally be detoxified by the liver Addison 's Disease = severe endocrine or glandular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of pages for the chemicals and drugs associated with acute coma and listed them alphabetically , each with a separate line to make it possible to add information as she got it : Alcohol Insulin Amphetamines Iodine Anesthetics Mercurial diuretics Anticonvulsants Metaldehyde Antihistamines Methyl bromide Aromatic hydrocarbons Methyl chloride Arsenic Naphazoline Barbiturates Naphthaline Bromides Opium derivatives Cannabis Pentachlorophenol Carbon disulfide Phenol Carbon monoxide Salicylates Carbon tetrachloride Sulfanilamide Chloral hydrate Sulfides Cyanide Tetrahydrozaline Glutethimide Vitamin D Herbicides Hypnotic agents Hydrocarbons Susan knew that the list was not complete but nonetheless it gave 114  | her something to go on , something to keep in mind during her subsequent investigations , and it could be enlarged at any time . Turning next to the general internal medicine textbooks , Susan opened the ponderous Principles of Internal Medicine and read the appropriate sections dealing with coma . The articles in Cecil and Loeb were about the same . Both books provided a rather good overview , although no new concepts were added . Several references were cited which Susan duly copied down in an ever-expanding list of necessary reading . It felt good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting yawn . She wiggled her toes to try to encourage the blood to go there . The cold draft along the floor had made her stir sooner than she might have otherwise . But once up she turned to the Index Medicus , the exhaustive listing of all articles published in all the medical journals . Starting with the most recent volumes and working backward , Susan searched for and extracted every article concerning acute coma and every article under the heading " Anesthetic complications : delayed return to consciousness . " By the time she had worked herself back to 1972 , Susan had a list of thirty-seven prospective papers worth reading . One title especially caught Susan 's attention : " Acute Coma at the Boston City Hospital : A Retrospective Statistical Study of Causes , " Journal of the American Association of Emergency Room Physicians , volume 21 , August 1974 , pp. 401-3 . She found the bound volume containing the article and was soon immersed in it , taking notes as she read . Bellows had to call her by name before she looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located her , and had taken the seat directly across from her . But she did not look up from her reading . Bellows had tried clearing his throat with absolutely no effect . It was as if Susan were in a trance . " Dr. Susan Wheeler , I believe , " said Bellows , leaning over the table , his shadow falling across the journal in front of her . Susan finally responded and looked up . " Dr. Bellows , I presume . " Susan smiled . " Dr. Bellows is right . God , what a relief . I thought for a moment 115  | you we coma . " Bellows shook his head up and down , as if he were agreeing with himself . Neither one ' of them spoke for a few moments . Bellows had prepared a short speech during which he was going to correct any impression he might have given Susan that she was free to cut lectures . He had decided to tell her in plain language that he had to get her ass in gear . But once confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directionless as a sailboat becalmed . Susan remained silent because her intuition had informed her that Bellows had something to say . The silence soon became mildly awkward . Susan broke it . " Mark , I 've been doing a bit of interesting reading here . Look at these figures . " She stood up and leaned across the table , holding out the journal so that Bellows could see the page . As she did so , her blouse fell away from her chest . Bellows found himself staring down at her splendid breasts , barely contained by a sheer flimsy bra , their skin of a smoothness Bellows imagined to be like velvet . He tried to concentrate on the page Susan was showing him , but his peripheral vision continued to record the insistent image of Susan 's lovely torso . Selfconsciously Bellows scanned the library , certain that his preoccupation would be transparent to anyone in the room . Susan was oblivious to the mental havoc she was inadvertently causing . " This chart here shows the order of incidence of the various types of acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hospital , " said Susan , running her finger along the lines . " One of the most amazing facts is that only fifty percent of the cases are ever diagnosed . I find that amazing ; would n't you agree ? That means that fifty percent of the cases are never diagnosed . They just come in to the ER in coma and die . Just like that . " " Yeah , it 's amazing , " said Bellows , putting his left hand up to his temple to try to keep from seeing what he was seeing . " And look here , Mark , at the causes of the cases which they do diagnose : sixty percent are due to alcohol , thirteen percent due to trauma , ten percent to strokes , three percent to drugs or poisons , and the rest divided up among epilepsy , diabetes , meningitis , and pneu-116  | monia . Now obviously . . . , " said Susan , sitting back dowt ? an ; relieving the stress on Bellows 's hypothalmus . Bellows glanced around once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ... we can dismiss alcohol and trauma as far as causing acute coma in the OR is concerned . So ... that leaves us with strokes , then drugs or poisons , and the others in decreasing probability as possible culprits . " " Wait a second , Susan , " said Bellows pulling himself together . He put his elbows on the table with his forearms up in the air , his hands drooped but engaged . His head was down at first , then he picked it up and looked at Susan . " That 's all very interesting . A little farfetched , but interesting . " " Farfetched ? " " Yeah . You can not possibly extrapolate data from the ER to the OR . But anyway , I did n't come in here looking for you to argue about that . I came in here because you have n't been answering your pages . I know , because it was me who was paging you . Look , I 'm going to have trouble if you do n't show up for conferences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact of the matter is that , while you 're on my service , your trouble is my trouble . I can only make excuses for you for so long . I mean , you can be drawing blood or scrubbing just so often . Stark will be asking questions before you know it . He 's phenomenal . He knows everything that 's going on around here . Besides , you 'll get the reputation of being a phantom among your own section students . Susan , I 'm afraid you 're going to have to restrict your research proclivities to after-hours . " " Are you finished ? " asked Susan , rising to the defense . " I 'm finished . " " Well , answer me this one question . Has Berman or Greenly awakened yet ? " " Of course not . . . " " Then frankly , I believe that my current activities eclipse the importance of a few boring surgical conferences . " " Oh my aching back ! Susan , be reasonable . You 're not going to save the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on a limb for you as it is. " 117  | " I appreciate it , Mark . Really I do . But listen . My few hours here in the library have already provided some very interesting information . The complication of prolonged coma after anesthesia is about one hundred times more prevalent here at Memorial than the incidence given for the rest of the country over the past year . Mark , I think I 'm onto something . When I started , it was more of an emotional thing which I thought I could work out in a day or two here in the library . But one hundred times ! God , I could be on the track of something big , like a new disease , or a lethal combination of normally safe drugs . What if this is some sort of viral encephalitis , or even the result of a previous infection which makes the brain somehow more susceptible to certain drugs or mild lack of oxygen ? " Susan had been part of the medical world for only two years , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accrue to someone who discovered a new disease or syndrome . She thought this one might become known as the Wheeler syndrome , and Susan 's success within the medical community would be guaranteed . More often than not , the discoverer of the new disease became far more famous than the discoverer of the cure for the same disease . Eponyms abound in medicine like the tetralogy of Fallot , Cogan 's disease , the Tolpin syndrome , or Depperman 's degeneration . Whereas names like the Salk vaccine are an anomaly . Penicillin is called penicillin , not Fleming 's agent . " We could call it the Free Wheeler Syndrome , " said Susan , allowing herself to laugh at her own enthusiasm . " Christ , " said Bellows , cradling his head in his hands . " What an imagination . But that 's OK . Naivete has a certain license . But , Susan , you are in a real world situation with certain specific responsibilities . You are still a medical student , low man or woman on the totem pole . You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation obligations or , believe me , your ass will be grass . I 'll give you one more day for this project , provided you show up for rounds in the morning . After that you work on it in your free time . Now , if I need you I 'll page Dr. Wheels instead of Wheeler , so answer it , understood ? " " Understood , " said Susan looking squarely at Bellows . " I 'll do that , if you do something for me. " 118  | " What 's that ? " " Pull out these articles and have them Xeroxed . I 'll pay you later . " Susan tossed her list of references to Bellows , jumped up from the table and breezed out of the room before Bellows could respond . He found himself looking at a list of thirty-seven journal articles . Since he knew the library like the bones of his hand , he located the volumes with ease , marking each article with a piece of paper . He took the first group over to the desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on his library charge . Bellows knew that he had been manipulated again , but he did n't mind . It had taken only ten minutes . Ile would get them back , with interest . And he had been right ; she had a dynamite figure . Monday February 23 5:05 P.M. As she had been telling Bellows that the incidence of coma following anesthesia at the Memorial was one hundred times the national incidence , Susan had realized that she was basing her calculations on the six cases Harris had mentioned in his outburst . Susan had to check that figure . If it was actually higher , she would have more ammunition to base her commitment to the project . Besides , she needed the names of the coma victims so that she could obtain their charts . What she needed more than anything else , she recognized , was hard data . Susan knew that she had to get access to the central computer . I larris would be unwilling to supply the names of the patients . Susan was certain of that . Bellows might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivated . But that was a big if . Susan felt that the best route was for her to try to get the information herself . So she was thankful she had taken the introductory course in PL 1 computer programming as a junior in college . Already it had paid off in 119  | surprising ways , and her need for the information at hand was just another example . The computer center in the hospital was located in the Hardy wing , occupying the entire top floor . Many people joked about the symbolic aspects of the computer being above everything else in the hospital , and it had added a new meaning to the phrase " with a little help from above . " As the elevator door slid open on the foyer of the eighteenth floor , Susan knew she was going to have to improvise if she were to be successful . Beyond the foyer Susan could see through glass partitions into the main computer reception area . The place had the appearance of a bank . The only difference was that the medium of exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception room and walked directly to a counter top that ran the length of the room along the right wall . There were about eight other people in the room , most of them sitting in comfortable-looking blue corduroy chairs . A few were at the counter top bent over computer request forms . All looked up as Susan traversed the room , but they quickly returned to their own affairs . Without the slightest hint of uncertainty Susan took one of the computer request forms . Ostensibly concentrating on the form , Susan had her real attention on the room . In the back of the room , about twelve feet from Susan , was a large white Formica desk . Above it hung a sign : " Information . " It was so appropriate that it brought a smile to Susan 's face . The man at the desk sat motionlessly , a slight proud smile on his face . He was about sixty , pudgy but neat . Behind him , visible through another glass partition , were the gleaming input-output terminals of the computer itself . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her , the man at the desk accepted several computer request forms . Each time he went over the form , converting the request to computer language and writing it on the lower portion of the form . He also checked the authorization by calling the department involved , unless he knew the requesting individual personally . Finally he placed the form or several stapled together in the " in " box on the corner of the desk . The requesting individual was told when to expect the information , depending on the priority assigned to the request . 120  | Having assessed the procedure , Susan gave full attention to the form before her . It was certainly simple enough . She filled in the date in the indicated box . She left blank the box for the authorizing department , and she also omitted the name of the requesting party or organization . Susan also left blank the box reserved for method of payment for computer time . She concentrated on the information desired . Susan was not sure how she should word the request for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uptight about leaking information on cases of coma resulting from anesthesia . Perhaps they might have programmed a subroutine into the computer so that any requests for such information would be automatically canceled , or at least alert the computer that the information had been requested . Another point that occurred to Susan was that a disease or disease process might have several modes or degrees of expression . Prolonged coma after an anesthetic might be one of them , maybe the most severe . Susan wanted to obtain a wide range of information and in that way be able to select what she thought was significant . But requesting all cases of coma for the past year might yield a printout that was too extensive . Since coma was a symptom and not a disease itself , Susan could end with a list of every heart attack , stroke , and cancer victim who had succumbed to those diseases over the last year . Susan decided to call only for cases of coma occurring in people who had no known chronic or debilitating disease . Then she realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track of a new disease , there was no reason why it could n't affect people who had other diseases . In fact , if it were infectious in nature , other disease processes would encourage its expression by lowering defenses . Susan changed her request to all cases of coma occurring to inpatients ( in hospital ) which were unrelated to the patient 's known disease processes . Susan next asked for a correlate between her sample and those having surgery during their stay at the Memorial prior to their coma , with a time correlation between surgery and the onset of the coma . With a certain amount of difficulty Susan translated her request into computer language . She had not used it for almost a year , and it took a few moments to get it right . This portion of the request was below two red lines and the admonishment " Do not write below this line . " 111  | Susan then waited for the next request to be turned in to the man at the desk . Luckily she did not have to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator arrived . Through the glass she saw a man squeeze past the elevator door before it had fully opened and approach the reception desk at a lope . About forty , slight of build , with flaxen hair parted from a deeply recessed hairline , the man waved a handful of the computer request forms nervously . " George , " said the man pulling up in front of the reception desk ,  --  you got ta help me . " " Ah , my old friend Henry Schwartz , " said the man behind the desk . " We 're always ready to help the accounting department . After all , that 's where our checks come from . What can I do for you ? " Susan carefully penciled in " Henry Schwartz " onto her own form in the box for the requesting party . In the area for authorizing department , Susan wrote " Accounting . " " I need a couple of things , but most of all I need a list of all the Blue Cross Blue Shield subscribers who have had surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid-fire fashion . " If you asked why I need it , you 'd crack up , I swear you would . But I need it and fast . The day shift was supposed to have had it ready for me . " " We can run it in an hour or so . I 'll have it for you by seven , " said George , stapling Schwartz 's requests together and tossing them into the box . " George , you 're a lifesaver , " said Schwartz , running his hand through his hair over and over again . He then headed toward the elevator . " I 'll be back at seven sharp . " Susan watched Schwartz press the " down " button and then walk back and forth in the elevator foyer . It looked as if he was talking to himself . He hit the " down " button several more times . After the elevator picked him up , Susan watched the floor indicator above the elevator . It stopped at six , then three , then one . Susan would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susan took another blank request form and , carefully placing it over her own , she headed for the desk . " Excuse me , " said Susan , marshaling a smile she hoped would be convincing . George looked up at her , over the tops of his blackrimmed glasses , which perched midway down his nose . " I 'm a medical 122  | student , " continued Susan , making her voice as sweet as possible , " and I 'm very interested in the computer here at the hospital . " She held up the request forms , the blank one hiding the one she had filled out . " You are , are you ? " said George , sitting back with a smile broadening on his own face . " I am , " repeated Susan shaking her head in the affirmative . " I think that the potential of the computer in medicine is very great , and since it is obviously not a part of our formal orientation here , I thought I 'd just come up and sort of get acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder through the glass iii partition at the gleaming IBM hardware . When he turned back to Susan his pride was effervescing . " It 's a marvelous set up , Miss ... " " Susan Wheeler . " " It is a fantastic machine , Miss Wheeler , " said George , leaning forward in his seat and lowering his voice and emphasizing his words , suggesting that he was telling Susan a tremendous secret . " The hospital could n't do without it . " " In order to get an idea how it is used , I 've been studying the request form here . " Susan held the request forms so that George would see only the blank one , but he had turned again to look into the terminal room . " I was interested to see a completed form , " continued Susan reaching over and taking the top group of stapled forms from the " in " box . " I was curious about how the requests were fed into the computer . Is it all right if I look at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her own . " Sure , " said George turning back to Susan . He stood up and leaned over toward Susan , placing his left hand on the desk . With his other hand he pointed to the space where the request was written in normal Fnglish . " Here the requesting party indicates what it is they want . Then down here ... " George 's finger moved down below the red lines " . . . we have the area where the request is translated into a language that the computer will understand . " Susan slipped her blank form from under the pile of Schwartz 's 123  | forms , as if comparing them and she put it down on the desk beside them leaving her own filled-out form underneath Schwartz 's . " So if someone wants several different kinds of information , they have to fill out separate forms ? " asked Susan . " Exactly , and if . . . " Susan turned Schwartz 's first request form back from the rest of them rapidly , pulling it free of the staple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm terribly sorry , " said Susan putting the top sheet back in position . " Look what I 've done . Let me staple it for you . " " No matter , " said George , fumbling for the staple machine himself . " One staple will fix it . " George pressed the staple machine as Susan held the completed forms , together with her own request on the underside . " Let me put these back before I destroy them completely , " said Susan contritely , replacing the forms in the " in " box . " No harm done , " reassured George . " Now once the request is in , what happens to it ? " asked Susan looking into the terminal room and taking George 's attention from the " in " box . " Well , I take them inside to the key puncher , who prepares the cards for the card reader . Then ... " Susan was not listening ; she was thinking of how best to terminate her visit . About five minutes later she was down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the accounting department . With a spare hour and a half , Susan left the Memorial for her dorm . Her stomach growled in opposition to her forgetfulness of basic needs . The tuna sandwich , as bad as it was , had long since disappeared into her metabolic mill , and Susan looked forward to dinner . 124  | Monday February 23 6:55 P.M. It was a little before seven when Susan alighted from the MBTA at the North Station stop . Crossing the footbridge spanning the street , Susan was exposed to the rush of wind whipping up from the partially frozen harbor water . She bent against its force , clutching her sheepskin ski hat with her left hand and the lapels of her peajacket with her right hand . She tried to keep the cold from her neck by snuggling her chin as far as possible into the recesses of her collar . When she rounded the edge of the building , the wind increased . An empty beer can tumbled past her into the street . The familiar rush hour sea of red taillights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . The windows on the cars were frosted , and they reflected the images about them with a silver sheen , giving the impression of the often white , unseeing pupils of the blind . Susan began to run at a slow jog with an exaggerated to and fro roll of her body since her arms were pressed against herself . The main entrance to the hospital yawned in front of her , and with relief she pushed through the revolving door . Susan stuffed her hat into the right sleeve of her coat and left it in the coatroom behind the main information desk . Then she used the hospital telephone directory and rang up the computer center . " Hello , this is the accounting department , " said Susan slightly out of breath and struggling to make her voice sound normal . " Has Mr. Schwartz picked up his material yet ? " The answer was affirmative ; he had collected it about five minutes earlier . The timing seemed perfect as far as Susan was concerned , and she left for the Hardy building elevator and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mere skeleton compared to the day shift . When Susan entered the room only three people were visible at the far end . Two men and one woman looked up in unison as Susan entered . 125  | " Excuse me , " called Susan , approaching the group . " Can you tell me where I can find Mr. Schwartz ? " " Schwartz ? Sure . He 's in the office in the corner , " said one of the men , pointing down the opposite side of the room . Susan 's eyes followed his finger . " Thanks , " she said , reversing her direction . Henry Schwartz was in the middle of the computer printout he had requested . The office was small but extraordinarily neat . The books in the bookcase were arranged so that their heights descended in an orderly fashion . The depth of the book backs in the shelves was one inch , no more , no less . " Mr. Schwartz ? " asked Susan smiling and walking up to his desk . " Yes ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printout . " It seems that my printout got mixed up with yours , or at least that was the combined opinion upstairs . I was wondering if you had noticed any material you had not requested ? " " No , but I have n't looked through it all yet . What was it you 're missing ? " " It 's some information on coma we need for a section presentation . Do you mind if I see if it 's included with your material ? " " Not at all , " said Schwartz , lifting sections of the printout to find the break points . " If it 's there , it would be the last section , " offered Susan . " They said it was run right after yours . " Schwartz lifted the bulk of the material from the desk . Remaining was the information Susan needed . Attached to the top was her request form . " That 's it , " said Susan . " But the form indicates I requested it , " questioned Schwartz glancing at the request form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your material , " said Susan , reaching for the material . " But I assure you , you would n't be interested in this stuff . And it 's certainly not your fault , by any means . " I 'd better say something to George . . . , " said Schwartz replacing his own printout in front of him . 126  | " No need , " said Susan , exiting . " We already discussed it at length . Thanks a million . " " You 're welcome , " said Schwartz , but Susan had already left . " Susan , you are too much , really too much , " said Bellows between spoonfuls of custard he had taken from the tray of a patient who was too nauseated to eat . " You skip the lecture , afternoon rounds , and avoid your patients , and now you 're hanging around here until eight p.m . The only consistency about your performance so far is constant variation . " Bellows laughed as he scraped the bottom of the custard cup . Susan and Bellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital day had begun for Susan . She was sitting in the same seat she had occupied that morning . Spilling over onto the floor was the IBM printout sheet she had obtained . She was running down the list of names and marking appropriate ones with a yellow felt-tip pen . Bellows took a drink from his coffee . " Well , that proves it , " said Susan , putting the cap on the pen . " Proves what ? " asked Bellows . " Proves that there have n't been six cases of unexplained coma , excluding Berman , here at the Memorial this last year . " " Hurray , " cheered Bellows , toasting with his coffee mug . " Now I can stop worrying about anesthesia and have my hemorrhoids fixed . " " I would recommend that you stick to your suppositories , " said Susan , counting the names she 'd marked . " There have n't been six because there 've been eleven . And if Berman continues on his present course , then there will have been twelve . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he showed interest in the IBM printout sheet for the first time . " That 's all that came out on this printout , " said Susan . " I would n't be surprised if there were a few more if I had been able to call up the information straight away . " " You really think so ? God , eleven cases ! " Bellows leaned over toward Susan , his tongue working at the empty spoon . " How 'd you manage to get this IBM printout ? " " Henry Schwartz was nice enough to help me , " said Susan nonchalantly. 127  | " Who the hell is Henry Schwartz ? " asked Bellows . " Damned if I know . " " Spare me , " said Bellows covering his eyes with his hand , " I 'm too tired for mental games . " " Is that a chronic ailment or an acute affliction ? " " Cut the crap . How 'd you get this data ? Something like this has to be cleared through the department . " " I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , gave it to the nice man at the desk , and then went back tonight and picked it up . " " I 'm sorry I asked , " said Bellows getting up and waving his spoon to suggest he would let the issue ride . " But eleven cases . Did they all happen during surgery ? " " No , " said Susan , going back to the printout . " Harris was on the level when he said six . The other five were from inpatients on the medical service . Their diagnosis was idiosyncratic reaction . Does n't that strike you as pretty odd ? " " No . " " Oh , come on , " said Susan impatiently . " The word idiosyncratic sounds great but it really means that they had no idea what the diagnosis was . " " That might be true , but Susan , dear , this happens to be a major hospital , not a country club . It serves as a referral base for the whole New England area . Do you know how many deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Deaths have causes . . . these cases of coma do not . . . at least not as yet . " " Well , deaths do n't always have apparent causes . That 's the purpose of autopsy . " " There , you hit the nail on the head , " said Susan . " When someone dies , then you do an autopsy and you find out what was the cause of death so that you can possibly add to your fund of knowledge . Well , in the coma cases you ca n't do an autopsy because the patients are somewhere hovering between life and death . That makes it even more important that you do another kind of opsy , ' a live-opsy , if you will . You study all the clues you have available , short of dismembering the victim . The diagnosis is just as important , maybe even more important 128  | than the autopsy diagnosis . If we could find out what was wrong with these people , maybe we could bring them out of their comas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " " Even the autopsy , " said Bellows , " does n't always provide the answers . There are plenty of deaths where the exact cause is never determined whether they do an autopsy or not . I happen to know that two patients threw in the towel today , and I doubt very much if a diagnosis will be made . " " Why do you think that the diagnosis wo n't be made ? " asked Susan . " Because both patients expired from respiratory arrest . They apparently just stopped breathing , very calmly with no warning . They were just discovered dead . And in respiratory arrest you do n't always find anything to hang the blame on . " Bellows had captured Susan 's interest . She was staring at him without moving , without blinking . " Are you OK ? " asked Bellows , waving his hand in front of her face . Still Susan did not move until she looked down at the IBM printout . " What the hell do you have , psychomotor epilepsy or something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epilepsy ? No , of course not . You said these cases today died of respiratory arrest ? " " Apparently . I mean they stopped breathing . They just gave up . " " What were they in the hospital for ? " " I 'm not positive . I think one of them was in for some problem with his leg . Maybe he had phlebitis and they might find a pulmonary embolus or something . The other one was in for Bell 's palsy . " " Were they both on I.V.s ? " " I do n't remember but I would n't be surprised if they had been . Why do you ask ? " Susan bit her lower lip , thinking about what Bellows had just told her . " Mark , do you know something ? These deaths you mentioned could be related to the coma victims . " Susan patted the printout with the back of her hand . " You might have hit on something . What were the names ? Can you remember ? " 129  | " For Christ 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . You 're working overtime and you 're starting to have delusions . " Bellows switched to an artificially concerned tone . " Do n't be concerned , though ; it happens to the best of us after we 've stayed up for two or three nights in a row . " " Mark , I 'm serious . " " I know you 're serious ; that 's what worries me . Why do n't you give yourself a break and forget about it for a day or so ? Then you calf pick it up and be more objective . I tell you what . I 've got tomorrow night off and with a little luck I can get out of here by seven . How about some dinner ? You 've only been here a day but you have to get away from the hospital as much as I do . " Bellows had n't planned on asking Susan out quite so soon and in such a fashion . But he was pleased because it had come so apparently spontaneously and consequently it would be easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like an offer to get together than an actual date . " Dinner 's fine , ca n't pass up an offer for a dinner even with an invertebrate . But really , Mark , what were the names of the two deaths today ? " " Crawford and Ferrer . They were patients on Beard 6 . " Susan pursed her lips as she wrote the names down in her notebook . " I 'll have to look into those in the morning . In fact . . . " Susan looked at her watch " . . . maybe tonight . If they were going to do an autopsy on these cases , when would it be ? " " Probably tonight or first thing in the morning , " shrugged Bellows . " Well then I better check tonight . " Susan refolded her printout . " Thanks , Mark , old boy ; you 've been a help again . " " Again ? " " Yeah . Thanks for those articles you Xeroxed for me . You 'll make a good secretary someday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See you tomorrow night . How about the Ritz ? I have n't eaten there for several weeks , " teased Susan , heading for the door . " Not so fast , Susan . I 'll see you at rounds in the morning at six-130  | thirty . Remember our deal . I 'll cover for you another day if you come to rounds . " " Mark , you 've been such a dear , really . Let 's not louse it up so soon . " Susan smiled and pulled some of her hair across her face with coquettish exaggeration . " I 'll be up till all hours reading all this material you got for me . I need one more full day . We 'll discuss it further tomorrow night . " Then she was gone . Again Bellows felt encouraged about Susan as he sipped his coffee . Then he got up . He had plenty of work to do . Monday February 23 8:32 P.M. The pathology lab was in the basement of the main building . Susan descended the stairs and emerged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness to the right and twisted out of view to the left . Stark bare light bulbs glowed from the ceiling at intervals of twenty to thirty feet . The light from each bulb met the light from the next in an uneasy penumbra , causing a strange interplay of shadows from the tangle of pipes along the ceiling . In a vain attempt to provide color to the dim subterranean world , angled stripes of bright orange paint had been painted on the walls . Directly opposite Susan , partially hidden from view , was an arrow pointing to the left , with the word Pathology stenciled above it . Susan turned down the corridor , her shoes making hollow noises on the concrete floor , competing with the hiss of the steam pipes . The atmosphere was oppressive ; the location within the bowels of the hospital was sinisterly appropriate . She was not heading for the pathology lab with any favorable anticipation . As far as Susan was concerned pathology represented the black side of medicine , the specialty that seemed to derive its nourishment from medical failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathologists 131  | analyzed or the obvious beneficial spinoffs for the living from the autopsies the pathologists performed were all lost on Susan . She had only seen one autopsy done during her course in pathology , and that had been one too many . Life had never seemed quite so fragile nor had death seemed quite so final as when Susan had watched the two overweight pathologists disembowel the body of a recently deceased patient . The memory of that event slowed Susan 's steps but it did not halt them . She was determined . But she had seemingly been walking for a hundred yards as the corridor twisted first in one direction then in another . She cast a nervous glance over her shoulder , wondering if she could have missed the door to the lab . With increased misgivings she continued . At several places , the light bulbs were not functioning and Susan 's shadow would appear in front of her and lengthen . Then as she moved into the sphere of influence of the next functioning light her shadow would pale and disappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each contained opaque windows . " Unauthorized Entry Forbidden " was lettered boldly across the cracked , frosted glass on each door . Stenciled in peeling gold paint below the window on the right door was " Pathology Laboratory . " Susan hesitated at the door , building up her confidence , wondering what sort of scene to prepare herself for . Cracking the door , she got a glimpse of the interior . A long black stone table dominated the room , running most of its length . Cluttered about on the table were microscopes , slides , slide boxes , chemicals , books , and an array of other equipment . Susan pushed open the door and stepped into the lab . The acrid smell of formaldehyde hung over the room . The entire wall on the right had shelving from floor to ceiling . With hardly a square inch remaining , the shelves were full of varying sized bottles and jars . Looking more closely , Susan realized that the amorphous colorless mass in the large jar closest to her was an entire human head cut neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wall of the throat was a granular mass . The label on the glass simply said , " Pharyngeal carcinoma , # 304-A6 1932 . " Susan shuddered and tried to keep herself from glancing at other equally gruesome specimens . 132  | At the far end of the room was another set of swinging doors identical to those from the corridor . From the room beyond , Susan could hear a mixture of voices and metallic sounds . She walked toward the doors as silently as possible , feeling herself an intruder in an alien and potentially hostile environment . Susan tried to peer through the crack between the doors . Although her visual field was limited she knew immediately that she was looking into the autopsy room . Slowly she began to open the left door . A loud ringing noise echoed around the room causing Susan to spin around , letting the autopsy room door snap shut behind her . At first she thought that she had tripped some alarm system and she felt the urge to bolt for the door into the corridor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another side door . " Well , hello there , " said the resident to Susan as he walked over to the sink and picked up a distilled water irrigator . He smiled at Susan as he squirted water over a tray of slides he was staining . The color went from a deep violet to clear . " Welcome to the path lab . You a med student ? " " Yes . " Susan forced a smile . " We do n't see many med students this time of day ... or night . Is there anything special we can do for you ? " " No , not really . I 'm just looking around . I 'm quite new here , " said Susan putting her hands in the pockets of her white coat , her pulse racing . " Make yourself at home . There 's coffee in the office here if you 're interested . " " No thanks , " said Susan walking back along the desk , aimlessly touching some of the slide boxes . The resident added another amber stain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , maybe you could help me , " said Susan fingering a few slides on the table . " Several patients from Beard 6 expired today . I wondered if they 've been . . . um ... " Susan tried to think of the right word . " What were the names ? " asked the resident wiping his hands . " There 's a post going on right now . " " Ferrer and Crawford. " 133  | The resident walked over to a clipboard hanging from a nail on the wall . " Hmmm . . . Crawford . That rings a bell . I think that was a medical examiner 's case . Here 's Ferrer . . . that 's a medical examiner 's case . And I was right , Crawford is too . They 're both medical examiner 's cases , but hold on . " The resident walked quickly over to the doors into the autopsy room and banged one open with the palm of his hand . With his right hand holding the edge of the remaining closed door he leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan 's view . " Hey , Hamburger , what 's the name of the case you 're doing ? " There was a pause and a voice but Susan could not hear it . " Crawford ! I thought that was an examiner 's case . " There was another pause . The resident came back into the room as the timer went off again . The ringing noise made Susan jump once more . The resident squirted more distilled water onto the slides . " The medical examiner released both cases to the department , as usual . Lazy son of a bitch . Anyway they 're doing Crawford right now . " Thanks , " said Susan . " All right if I go in and take a look ? " " By all means , our pleasure , " said the resident , shrugging his shoulders . Susan paused momentarily at the doors , but she knew the resident was watching her , so she pushed open one of the doors and entered the room . The room was probably forty feet square , old and dingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ancient , cracked , and missing in places . The floor was a type of gray terrazzo . In the center of the room there were three marble tables built with slanted tops . A stream of water constantly ran down each table toward a drain at the foot , which emitted a constant sucking noise . Over each table hung a hooded light , a scale , and a microphone . Susan found herself standing on a level three to four steps above the level of the main floor . Immediately to her right were several wooden benches on progressively lower tiers . These benches were a remnant from older days when groups would assemble to observe autopsies . Only one of the hooded lights was on , that over the table nearest to 134  | Susan . It cast its relatively narrow beam down onto the naked corpse on the table immediately below . On each side of the table stood a pathology resident wearing an oilcloth apron and rubber gloves . The focal point of light caused the rest of the room to slide into graded burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the room was in shadow but it was possible for Susan to see that it also held a naked corpse , a manila tag tied around its right big toe . A large Y-shaped sutured incision crossed the thorax and abdomen . The third table was barely visible in the darkness , but it appeared to be empty . Susan 's entrance stopped all progress in the room . Both residents were staring at her with their heads tilted down to avoid the glare of the overhead light . One of the residents , with a large moustache and sideburns , was in the process of suturing the Y-shaped incision on the male corpse under the light . The other resident , taller by almost a foot , was standing before a basin containing the disemboweled organs . Having sized up Susan , the taller resident went back to work . He reached into the tangle of organs with his left hand , grasping the liver . Ilis right hand gripped a large , razor-sharp butcher knife . A few strokes freed the liver from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oozed into the scale . The resident stepped on a foot pedal on the floor , speaking into the microphone . " The liver appears reddish brown with a lightly mottled surface , period . The gross weight is . . . a . . . two point four kilograms , period . " He then reached into the pan and lifted the liver out , dropping it back into the basin . Susan descended several steps toward the group . The smell was slightly fishy ; the air seemed greasy and heavy , like an uncleaned bus depot restroorn . " The liver consistency is more firm than usual but definitely pliant , period . " The knife flashed in the light and the liver surface separated . " The cut surface demonstrates an enhanced lobar pattern , period . " The knife sliced across the liver in four or five more places , then finally cut a piece out of the center . " The cut specimen demonstrates the usual friable character , period . " Susan moved up to the foot of the table . The sucking drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left reached into the 135  | basin for another organ but he stopped when the moustached resident spoke . " Well , hello ... " " Greetings , " said Susan ; " sorry to bother you . " " No bother . Join the party , except we 've almost finished . " " Thanks , but I 'm happy to just watch . Is this Crawford or Ferrer ? " " This is Ferrer , " said the resident . Then he pointed at the other body . " That 's Crawford . " " I was wondering if you 've determined a cause of death . " " No , " said the taller resident . " But we have n't opened the lungs on this case yet . Crawford was clean grossly . Maybe the microscopic sections will shed some light . " " Do you expect something in the lungs ? " asked Susan . " Well , from the history of apparent respiratory arrest , we were considering pulmonary embolism . But I do n't think we 're going to find anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections . " " Why do n't you think you 'll find anything ? " " Well , because I 've posted a few cases like this before , and I 've never found anything . And the history is exactly the same . Relatively young , somebody comes by and they 're not breathing . There 's a resuscitation attempt but without luck . Then we get them , or at least after the medical examiner turns them over to us . " " About how many such cases would you estimate ? " " Over what time span ? " " Whatever . . . a year , two years . " " Maybe six or seven over the last two years . I 'm guessing . " " And you do n't have any ideas about the cause of death ? " " Nope . " " None ? " asked Susan , a bit surprised . " Well , I think it 's something with the brain . Something turns off their breathing . Maybe a stroke , but I did brain sections like you would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing . Clean as a whistle . " Susan began to feel a bit queasy . The atmosphere , the smell , the images , the noises all joined forces to make her feel light-headed and she shuddered with a mild wave of nausea . She swallowed . 136  | " Are the hospital charts for Ferrer and Crawford down here ? " " Sure , they 're in the coffee room through the lab . " " I 'd like to look at them for a few minutes . If you find anything significant , would you give me a yell ? I 'd be interested in seeing it . " The taller resident lifted the heart and placed it on the scale . " These your patients ? " " Not exactly , " said Susan , starting toward the exit , " but they might be . " The taller resident looked quizzically over at the other as Susan left . I Iis companion was watching Susan exit , trying to figure out a smooth way of getting her name and number . The coffee room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine was an ancient device , the paint on one side burned and the wire frayed to the point of being a real hazard . The countertop desk along both side walls was spread with charts , paper , books , coffee cups , and a welter of ballpoint pens . " That was quick , " said the resident who had been staining the slides . He was sitting at one of the desks , with a half-filled cup of coffee and a half-eaten doughnut . He was busy signing a large stack of typed pathology reports . " Autopsies are apparently too much for me , " admitted Susan . " You get used to it , like everything else , " said the resident , stuffing more doughnut into his mouth . " Possibly . Where would I look for the charts of the patients they are posting ? " The resident washed down the doughnut with coffee , swallowing with some effort . " In that shelf marked Post . ' When you finish with them , put them over there in the shelf marked Medical Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear wall , Susan faced a series of cubic shelves . One of the shelves was marked " Post . " On it she found Ferrer 's and Crawford 's charts . Clearing one of the desks of debris , Susan sat down and took out her notebook . At the top of an empty page she wrote , " Crawford , " on the top of another she wrote , " Ferrer . " Methodically she began to extract the charts as she had done with Nancy Greenly's. 137  | Tuesday February 24 8:05 A.M. Susan had found it unbelievably difficult to emerge from the warmth and comfort of her bed when the radio alarm went off the following morning . The fact that it was a Linda Ronstadt selection was a big help in that it caused some degree of pleasant association in Susan 's mind and instead of turning the radio off , she lay there and let the sounds and rhythm course through her . By the time the song was over Susan was fully awake , her mind beginning to race over the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least until three A.M. , had been passed in deep concentration with the large pile of journal articles , the books on anesthesiology , her own internal medicine book , and her clinical neurology text . She had amassed an enormous amount of notes , and her bibliography had increased to some one hundred articles that she planned to drag from the library stacks . The project had become more complex , more demanding , yet at the same time more fascinating , more absorbing . As a consequence Susan had become even more determined , and she realized that she was going to have to accomplish a great deal that day . Shower , dressing , and breakfast were dispatched with commendable speed . During breakfast , she reread some of her notes , realizing that she would have to reread the last few articles she had read the night before . The walk to the MBTA stop on Huntington Avenue proved to Susan that the weather had not changed and she cursed the fact that Boston had to be situated so far north . With luck she found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfold a portion of her IBM printout . She wanted to check once more the number of cases which it suggested . " Good to see you , Susan . Do n't tell me you 're going to go to lecture today ? " Susan looked up into the grinning face of George Niles , who was holding on to the bar above her head . " I 'd never miss lecture , George ; you know that . " 138  | " Looks like you missed rounds . It 's after nine . " " I could say the same to you . " Susan 's tone hovered between being friendly and combative . " I was told in no uncertain terms that I had to be seen in Student I lealth to rule out a comminuted compound skull fracture from yesterday 's gala event in the OR . " " You are OK , are n't you ? " asked Susan with genuine sincerity and concern . " Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's just hard to patch up my injured ego . That was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ego had to heal itself . " Susan allowed herself to laugh . Niles joined . The car stopped at Northeastern University . " Missing half of your first day at Surgery at the Memorial , then skipping rounds the next day , that 's commendable , Miss Wheeler . " George assumed a serious expression . " In no time at all you 'll be able to run for medical student Phantom of the Year . If you keep it up you 'll be able to challenge the record set by Phil Greer during secondyear Pathology . " Susan did n't answer . She went back to her IBM sheets . " What are you working on , anyway ? " asked Niles , twisting himself in an attempt to view the printout right side up . Susan looked up at Niles . " I 'm working on my Nobel Prize acceptance speech . I 'd tell you about it but you might miss lecture . " The car plunged down into the tunnel , beginning its transit under the city . Conversation became impossible . Susan resumed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damn sure of the numbers . With its private offices Beard 8 resembled Beard 10 . Susan walked down the corridor , stopping at room 810 . The door had crisp black lettering across its aged but polished mahogany surface : " Department of Medicine , Professor J. P. Nelson , M.D. , Ph.D . " Nelson was Chief of Medicine , Stark 's counterpart , but associated with internal medicine and its subspecialties . Nelson was also a powerful figure in the medical center but not quite as influential as Stark , nor was he as dynamic , and as a fund raiser , he could n't even compare . Nevertheless , it took a bit of fortitude on Susan 's part to get 139  | up the nerve to approach this Olympian figure . With some hesitation she pushed open the mahogany door and faced a secretary with wirerimmed glasses and a comfortable smile . " My name is Susan Wheeler and I called a few minutes ago to see Dr. Nelson . " " Yes of course . You 're one of our medical students ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what " our " meant in that context . " You 're lucky , Miss Wheeler , to catch Dr. Nelson in . Plus I believe he remembers you from a class or something . Anyway , he 'll be with you shortly . " Susan thanked her and retreated to one of the stiff black waitingroom chairs . She pulled out her notebook to scan more of her notes , but instead found herself viewing the room , the secretary , and the lifestyle it meant for Dr. Nelson . As far as the value system in medical school was concerned , such a position represented the final triumph of years of effort and even luck . It was just the kind of luck Susan felt could be behind her present quest . All someone needed was one lucky break and the doors would open . The reverie was cut short by the door to the inner office being opened . Two doctors in long white coats came from within , continuing their conversation at the door . Susan could get bits and pieces and it seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a locker in the surgical lounge . The younger of the two men was quite agitated and spoke in a whisper whose sound level was approximately equal to normal speech . The other gentleman had the portly bearing of a mature physician , replete with soft , knowing eyes , luxuriant graying hair , and a consoling smile . Susan knew it had to be Dr. Nelson . He seemed to be trying to console the other with reassuring words and a lingering pat on the shoulder . Once the other doctor had left , Dr. Nelson turned to Susan and beckoned for her to follow him . Nelson 's office was a tumble of reprinted journal articles , scattered books , and stacks of letters . It appeared as if a tornado had swept through the room several years previously with no subsequent effort at reconstruction . The furniture consisted of a large desk and an old cracked leather chair that squeaked as Dr. Nelson lowered his weight into it . There were two other smaller leather chairs facing the desk . 140  | Susan was motioned to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briars and opened a tobacco canister on the desk . Before filling the pipe he hit it on the palm of his left hand a few times . The few ashes that appeared were carelessly scattered on the floor . " Ah yes , Miss Wheeler , " began Dr. Nelson , scanning a note card on his desk . " 1 remember you well from physical diagnosis class . You were from Wellesley . " " Radcliffe . " " Radcliffe , of course . " Dr. Nelson corrected his note card . " What can we do for you ? " " I 'm not sure how to start . But I 've become very interested in the problem of prolonged coma , and I have begun to look into it . " Dr. Nelson leaned back , the chair squeaking in agony . He placed the tips of his fingers together . " That 's fine , but coma is a big subject , and , more important , it is a symptom rather than a disease in itself . It is the cause of the coma that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have become interested in ? " " I do n't know . In short , that 's why I 'm interested in it . I 'm interested in the kind of coma that just seems to happen and no cause is found . " " Are you concerned with emergency room patients or in-hospital patients ? " asked Dr. Nelson , whose voice changed slightly . " Inpatients . " " Are you referring to the few cases that have occurred during surgery ? " " If you call seven few . " " Seven , " said Dr. Nelson taking several long pulls from his pipe , " I believe is a rather high estimate . " " It 's not an estimate . Six previous cases occurred during surgery . Presently there is another case upstairs , operated on yesterday , that appears to fit into the same category . In addition , there have been at least five cases on the medical floor occurring in patients admitted for some seemingly unrelated complaint . " " How did you get this information , Miss Wheeler ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The previous warmth was gone . His eyes regarded Susan without blinking . Susan was unaware of this change in apparent mood . 141  | " I got the information from this computer printout right here . " Susan leaned forward with the printout and handed it across the desk to Dr. Nelson . " The cases I 've mentioned have been indicated with yellow ink . You 'll see that there is no mistake . Besides , this represents only coma cases for the last year . I do n't know what the incidence was before then , and I think it would be essential to get a year-by-year printout . In that way one could have a better idea if this problem is static or on a dynamic upswing . And perhaps even more important , or at least equally important , I have a feeling that a number of sudden deaths here at the Memorial could be ascribed to the same unknown category . I believe the computer could help on that as well . Anyway , it is for these reasons that I wanted to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this endeavor . What I need is full clearance to use the computer and the opportunity to get the hospital charts on these patients . I came to you because I have an intuitive feeling that it represents some sort of unknown medical problem . " With her case presented , Susan allowed herself to sit back into the chair . She felt she had put the matter fairly and completely ; if Dr. Nelson was going to be interested , he certainly had enough to go on to make up his mind . Dr. Nelson did not speak right away . Instead he continued to regard Susan ; then he studied the printout , taking short , quick puffs on his pipe . " This is all very interesting information , young lady . Of course I have been aware of the problem . However , there are other implications in these statistics and I can assure you that this apparent high incidence is occurring because ... well , frankly ... we have been lucky over the last five or six years that we have n't had any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , though ... and indeed that seems to be the case at present . As to your request , I 'm afraid I 'm not in a position to grant it . You undoubtedly understand one of the major impediments to our establishing our central computer information bank was the creation of adequate safeguards concerning the confidentiality of most of the information stored . It is impossible for me to give blanket authorization . In fact , this type of endeavor is really ... what should I say ... hmm ... beyond ... or above that which a 142  | medical student of your level is equipped to deal with . I think it would be in everyone 's best interest , yours included , if you would limit your research interests to more scientific projects . I 'm certain I could find room for you in our liver lab , if you were interested . " Susan was so accustomed to academic encouragement that she was totally caught off guard by Dr. Nelson 's negative response to her investigation . Not only was he not interested , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Susan hesitated , then stood up . " Thank you very much for the offer . But I 've just gotten so involved with this study that I think I 'll follow it up for a while . " " Suit yourself , Miss Wheeler . But I 'm sorry ; I can not help you . " " Thank you for your time , " said Susan , reaching out for her computer printout . " I 'm afraid this information can not be made available for you any longer , " said Dr. Nelson interposing his hand between Susan 's and the IBM sheet . Susan kept her hand extended for a second of indecision . Once again Dr. Nelson had caught her off guard with an unexpected response . It seemed absurd that he would actually have the gall to confiscate material she already had . Susan did not say another word and she avoided looking at Dr. Nelson . She got her things together and left . Dr. Nelson instantly picked up the telephone and placed a call . Tuesday February 24 10:48 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of the latest books on anesthesiology , some still in prepublication hound galleys , sent for his endorsement . For Susan this was a boon , and her eyes scanned the titles for any books specifically on complications . She located one , and she wrote down the title and 143  | publisher . Next she looked for any general texts which she had not seen in the library . And her eyes registered another find : Coma : Pathophysiological Basis of Clinical States . Excitedly she withdrew the volume and thumbed through it , noticing the chapter headings . She wished she had had the book at the onset of her reading . The door to the office opened and Susan looked up to face Dr. Robert Harris for the second time . Instantly she felt a certain sense of intimidation or scorn as Dr. Harris regarded her without the slightest sign of recognition or friendliness . It had not been Susan 's idea to wait for him in his office ; it had been the direct order of the secretary who had arranged the meeting for Susan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interloper in Dr. Harris 's private sanctum . The fact that she was holding one of his books made it that much worse . " Be sure to put the volume back where you found it , " said Harris as he turned to close the door , his speech slow and deliberate as if addressed to a child . He removed his long white coat and hung it on the hook on the back of the door . Without another word he retreated behind his desk to open a large ledger and make several notations . He acted as if Susan were not even there . Susan closed the textbook and replaced it on the shelf . Then she returned to the director 's chair in which she had started her wait for Dr. Harris thirty minutes before . The only window was directly behind Harris , and its light , combining with the overhead fluorescent light , gave a strange shimmering quality to Harris 's appearance . Susan had to squint against the glare coming directly at her . The smooth tawny color of Harris 's arms was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left wrist . His forearms were massive , tapering to surprisingly narrow shafts . Despite the time of year and the temperature , Dr. Harris was dressed in a short-sleeved blue shirt . Several minutes went by before he finished with the ledger . After closing the cover he pressed a buzzer for his secretary to come in and take it . Only then did he turn and acknowledge Susan 's existence . " Miss Wheeler , I am certainly surprised to see you in my office . " Dr. Harris slowly leaned back in his chair . He seemed to have some difficulty looking directly at Susan . Because of the background 144  | lighting Susan could not see the details of his face . His tone was cold . There was a silence . " I would like to apologize , " began Susan , " for my apparent impertinence yesterday in the recovery room . As you probably are aware , this is my first clinical rotation , and I 'm unaccustomed to the hospital environment , particularly to the recovery room . On top of that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our meeting I had spent some time with the very patient you were attending . I had started his I.V . prior to surgery . " Susan paused , hoping for some sign of acknowledgment from the faceless figure in front of her . There was none . There was no movement whatsoever . Susan continued . " The fact of the matter was that my conversation with the patient had not remained on an entirely professional level ; in fact , we had tentatively agreed to meet sometime on a social basis . " Susan paused again but silence continued from Dr. Harris . " I 'm offering this information more as an explanation than an excuse for my reaction in the recovery room . Needless to say , when I was confronted with the reality of the patient 's condition , I became quite upset . " " So you reverted to the vestiges of your sex , " said Harris condescendingly . " Excuse me ? " Susan had heard his comment , but by reflex she questioned whether she had heard him correctly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . " Susan felt a flush spread across her cheeks . " I 'm not sure how to take that . " " Take it at face value . " There was an awkward pause . Susan fidgeted , then spoke . " If that is your opinion of being a woman , then I plead guilty ; emotionalism under such circumstances is understandable from any human being . 1 admit the fact that I was not the archetypical professional at the first meeting with the patient , but I think that if the roles had been reversed , I being the patient and the patient being the doctor , it probably would have come out the same . I hardly think that susceptibility to human responses is a frailty reserved for female 145
