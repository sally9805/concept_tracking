Memories evidently are short in Colombia , the largest of the working democracies remaining in South America . Little more than a decade ago , the country writhed under the dictatorship of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla , who was installed by the country 's civilian and military leadership in 1953 to help bring an end to la violencia that eventually claimed 200,000 lives . Graft and jack-booted brutality characterized his regime . One memorable day in 1956 , when Rojas ' banner was raised in the Bogota bullring , squads of plainclothes police with knives and billy clubs closed in on spectators who failed to applaud . After a wave of popular revulsion , a junta sent the general into exile in 1957 . <P> Last week when Colombians went to the polls to choose a successor to President Carlos Lleras Restrepo , a Liberal whose four-year term ends in August , the price of poor memory was near chaos . The early favorite was Economist Misael Pastrana , 46 , the " official " Conservative party candidate under the National Front system . The Front was created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to defuse Colombia 's explosive politics by passing into law a unique arrangement : until 1974 , the parties could campaign for the presidency only in alternate election years . <P> Almost any number can play , however , and this year-the Conservatives ' " on " year-the strongest of Pastrana 's three opponents turned out to be old Dictator Rojas , who had conveniently become a splinter Conservative for the occasion . With little support from the basically apolitical army , Rojas , now 70 , effectively drummed up enthusiasm among the peasants . Touring the barrios , he played the populist , promising cars for everybody and warning of a " dialogue of daggers " with the ruling elite . <P> As the first returns came in last week , Rojas quickly claimed victory-but then so did Pastrana . When Lleras Restrepo announced that the close vote would take several days to tally , Rojas charged " bald robbery , " and thousands of Rojistas swarmed into Bogota 's main intersection . Lleras Restrepo declared a state of siege and threw a cordon of troops around Rojas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , well-trained riot police managed to clear the streets with no fatalities and few injuries . At week 's end Pastrana led by 66,000 votes . The slim margin surprised those who had speculated that the slow count meant that the election results were being juggled in Pastrana 's favor . <P> The Lesson . A National Front defeat would hardly do Colombia any good . Lleras Restrepo has done much to cure the financially sick country during his four years as President . He strengthened the peso through tougher tax collection , a drive on inflation and a strong grip on military spending . He also pushed agrarian reform and a birth control pro gram , notwithstanding the Vatican 's opposition . Unfortunately , none of this meant much to the peasants , to whom the diminutive ( 5 ft. 2 in . ) Lleras Restrepo appears as a somewhat abrasive and distant technocrat . " The lesson , " he said , visibly shocked at the closeness of the election , " is to be in closer contact with the masses . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
