As director of Ralph Nader 's Health Research Group , Dr. Sydney Wolfe has prodded federal agencies into protecting the public against a number of health hazards , from Red Dye No. 2 to chloroform . Though Wolfe 's critics grudgingly acknowledge his effectiveness , they maintain that he is overzealous . Last week Wolfe gave critics some new ammunition . <P> In a letter to HEW Secretary Joseph Califano , Wolfe asked for an immediate ban on the sale of the widely prescribed pain reliever propoxyphene , best known as Darvon . He claimed not only that Darvon is an ineffective painkiller , but also that in excessive doses it produces a euphoric high , which he says , " makes it attractive as a drug of abuse .

Lilly notes that the average person would have to take 30 large-size Darvon capsules at one time ( the usual dose is one every four hours ) to cause death , 15 if he were intoxicated . Further , the drug is a controlled substance-a prescription is good for only five refills within six months . ( If HEW will not ban Darvon , Wolfe wants the drug reclassified so that prescriptions can not be refilled . ) <P> Lilly also says that Wolfe 's claim about Darvon 's effectiveness is misleading because it is largely based on studies of single , rather than multiple , doses of the drug . Doctors prefer Darvon for some patients because , unlike aspirin , it does not cause gastrointestinal bleeding or lower the body temperature . Concludes Lilly 's Dr. Robert Furman : " Used as directed , Darvon is really very safe . The fact that some people are intent on abusing it should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
