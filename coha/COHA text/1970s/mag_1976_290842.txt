STAMPEDE TO CARTER <P> Now the choice is down to three-and they are among the most unusual politicians in the nation 's history . The next President of the U.S. will be either Jimmy Carter , the one-term Georgia Governor who has had the most spectacular political rise since Wendell Willkie in 1940 ; or Ronald Reagan , the two-term California Governor who staged the most successful challenge against an incumbent since Theodore Roosevelt took on William Howard Taft in 1912 ; or Gerald Ford , the longtime Michigan Congressman whom fate , Watergate and the 25th Amendment propelled into the Oval Office . Their status as survivors tells much about the changing state of the nation , the political parties and the voters ' mood . <P> For all their obvious differences of personality and policy , even their critics concede that all three are decent , honest and experienced . On most matters they are moderate men . None calls for severely chopping the defense budget or taking any extreme actions on the economy ; though Reagan has made some by-jingo statements , he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is suspicious of Big Government , wary of grandiose programs and weary of taxes , all three finalists promise to shake up the bureaucracy , stunt the growth of Federal spending and generally practice prudence . Thus they reflect the questioning , skeptical mood of the electorate . <P> Throughout the primaries , the voters repudiated familiar old politicians ; Ford 's great powers of incumbency could not stop Reagan from bouncing back after successive defeats in the first five primaries . The voters were smitten by fresh faces , unblemished by Washington-not only Carter and Reagan but also , toward the end , by Democrat Jerry Brown . Democratic favorites fell like bowling pins . Henry Jackson , the early front runner , did not even survive the first half of the primary season , and even Carter got a scare at the end . Liberals fared worst of all : the Democrats rejected Fred Harris , Mo Udall , Birch Bayh , Sargent Shriver and Milton Shapp . <P> That the usually brawling Democrats were uniting behind Carter while Ford and Reagan were still slugging it out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching roles . The Democrats went through the primary campaign with allegiances divided among 15 candidates-from Harris the portside populist to George Wallace the starboard demagogue . Now they figured that unity would spell victory . They smelled blood because the Republicans were opening their veins like suicidal ancient Romans . The battle between Ford and Reagan is certain to intensify still more after Reagan 's near-sweep last week of Missouri at-large delegates ( see story page 13 ) .
