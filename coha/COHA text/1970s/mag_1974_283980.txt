Lawrence Cardinal Shehan , 76 , is a slight ( 5 ft. 5 in. ) , self-effacing prelate who as Archbishop of Baltimore has been a tenacious fighter for liberal causes . Named to the diocese in 1961 , Shehan issued , a year later , a blunt pastoral letter demanding the end of racial discrimination in all phases of Catholic life . He lent personal weight to his words by joining Martin Luther King 's 1963 march on Washington . When Pope Paul VI named him cardinal in 1965 , Shehan viewed the honor as a papal endorsement of " racial justice . " But he was not always so heartily endorsed at home ; testifying in favor of open housing in 1966 , he was booed and jeered . His own mounting concern about the war in Viet Nam finally grew into an angry 1971 declaration that the conflict was " a scandal the Christian conscience can no longer endure . " <P> Last week word came from Rome that Pope Paul VI had accepted the cardinal 's resignation as archbishop , tendered last year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new archbishop will be Bishop William Borders , 60 , of Orlando , Fla. , a prelate known for his programs to help migrant workers and other poor . Shehan will remain a cardinal for the rest of his life .
