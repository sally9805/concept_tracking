To die or not to die ; it may be your choice . Editor 's Note : Dollie Cole , as a trustee of the Meyer L. Prentis Cancer Center in Detroit , has been very close to growing excitement there over the possibility of a major scientific breakthrough on the isolation of a breast cancer virus . So it seemed only appropriate that the Post assign the writing of an article on this vital subject to Mrs. Cole , bringing to it her pungent personal viewpoints as well as the available expertise of the Center 's concerned staff Dollie is an author who gets down to bedrock and puts things in no nonsense terms everyone can understand . Her enthusiasm is reminiscent of our founder , Ben Franklin , who said , " We can make these times better , if we bestir ourselves . " " All I do is light fires , " says Dollie Cole , characteristically . Well . in Detroit where clout is commonplace , where mere giants take orders from legends , and the put-down is honed to an art  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more like a blowtorch . As the wife of the President of General Motors , mother of four . a dazzling hostess and a notable horsewoman and tennis player , Dollie is news enough in herself but what she does beyond all that is encyclopedic . In recent years she has been teaching speech therapy to the mentally retarded ; she serves on the boards of such organizations as Project Hope , the Michigan Vocational Rehabilitation Service for the Handicapped , Michigan Humane Society , Michigan Cancer Foundation , and the International Institute of Metropolitan Detroit . She is a member of the Board of Directors of the Public Broadcasting Service , vice-president of the Anti-Cruelty League of Oakland County , a commissioner of the Detroit Zoo , and has a list of other activities as long as an assembly line . One columnist describes Mrs. Cole as a " talkative , talked-about woman who casts a spell over you . . . a woman who could charm a fish out of the water . " When Dollie Cole is part of a project , they say that fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollie , then , to arouse concern and call attention to this lifesaving project ? " My lather died of cancer in 1955 , " says Dollie Cole . " I feel that cancer is virtually the most serious problem every person faces after twenty . Here at the Center we are presently concerned with the cause of cancer  --  until you find that cause you 'll never find the cure . I am primarily interested in women coming to the Center , willing to be examined : That way , they can protect their own health , and add to the great store of information building up to isolate thecause of breast cancer . " Writing of the work conducted at the Meyer Prentis Center in Detroit , named after a former Treasurer of General Motors , Mrs. Cole offers her usual **26;3558;TOOLONG comment . While I was sitting under a dryer in Saks beauty salon indulging myself in my once-a-week passion of scanning the Hollywood gossip columns , my thoughts were interrupted somewhere between Elizabeth Taylor 's reunion with . Burton and someone giving birth out of wedlock to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Cory SerVaas , executive editor of The Saturday Evening Post , giving me an assignment in her usual quiet and calm manner , always making it seem as if the story could be written between your first and second cup of coffee . Cory did herself proud . " Write a story about breast cancer , talk with women who have had a radical mastectomy , modified radical mastectomies and irradiation , and do n't forget a lumpectomy . " " Do n't forget ? " I replied . " Great Scott , I ca n't even spell those words and certainly do not pretend to know anything about any form of breast cancer except the usual information that floats around at gatherings of women where everything from the energy crisis to why older women run off with younger men is discussed , with little concern for facts . " After pleading total ignorance , I was certain my editor would be discouraged , but instead , she said the article had to be written by a lay person seeking knowledge from those who are searching for the cause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those who have it now . " Oh yes , " she said , " it must be absolutely factual . " Okay , where do I start ? Since I live in Detroit , what does my city offer a woman who fears cancer of the breast , by far the most common malignant tumor in American women ? One out of every seventeen American women is destined to have breast cancer . Breast cancer rarely occurs before the age of thirty and occurs only one-one hundredth as often in men as in women . So in the area of breast cancer , it 's still a man 's world . In talking with friends who have had breast cancer , I was asked what I would do if I were told by a competent physician that I had breast cancer . " Cry a lot , " was my immediate response . " Funny , " one said , " so did I , until I was all cried out and realized that tears are definitely not a cure for anything but a temporarily broken heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first reaction to the diagnosis of cancer . The second reaction was to deter . mine the available treatment and the dangers involved and to locate the most advanced center for the study of breast cancer . When the doors of the Meyer L. Prentis Cancer Center officially opened to the four and a half million people of Metropolitan Detroit , the Michigan Cancer Foundation ( MCF ) took a giant step into the future . From this efficient Center , a concentrated effort at understanding and meeting the total cancer-related needs of our community in the 1970 's , the 1980 's and beyond are to be made . The Foundation has come a long way since the 1940 's , when $5,000 and an experimental rat colony worth $2,000 were the main assets of the newly incorporated Detroit Institute of Cancer Research and when the Women 's Field Army , under the auspices of the National Federation of Women 's Clubs , provided the only volunteer assistance to cancer patients and their families , and used an old supermarket as its headquarters . Now the Foundation is a unified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , conducts a detection clinic , carrie : , on public education programs and operates a bin-statistical research center . A slim beginning , a rat colony without a home . One of the unlikely , but real beginnings of the Michigan Cancer Foundation . It all began back in 194I , with the closing of the Columbia University Crocker Laboratory for Cancer Research . Among the articles to be disposed of was a colony of inbred rats , the only carefully studied line of its type in the country . What to do with them ? Two of the researchers who had worked with the rats , Drs . Maynie R. Curtis and Willielmina Dunning , found them a temporary home by shipTHE // ping them back to a family farm and storing them in a barn . Soon a laboratory was found for both researchers and rats . It was in the basement of a now unknown building . Then all of the rats moved into a seventeen-year-old edifice originally designed as a repair shop for trucks . It had by then been converted to a supermarket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly here I am in the new Meyer L. Prentis Cancer Center . Fantastic that it grew from such a humble origin . From Dr. Michael Brennan , president of the Meyer Prentis Center , I learned that Dr. Wilhelmina Dunning , now in her eighties , is living in Florida raising her inbred rats for research , and has on her farm several dozen cats that must be going out of their minds with all those rats just out of reach . So , Dr. Brennan , she 's still quite a gal ! From the 420,000 plum-colored bricks of its exterior to the liberal use of polished woods in its interior , the new Meyer L. Prentis Cancer Center exudes strength tempered with warmth . The environment must be rigidly controlled , so a variety of protective and monitoring systems have been installed . They focus primarily on the Foundation 's most fragile tenants  --  the purebred mouse colony . Only a few degrees ' variance in room temperature , for example , could wipe the mice and several five-year research projects right out of existence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchman method ( security guards record the temperature within the mice areas every hour ) , but by automatic alarms which sound off the instant the temperature goes above or below safe levels . In addition , a monitoring unit in the building 's basement enables the reading of temperatures in every area of the building . In order to keep the mouse colony and other research areas of the building free from contaminants , pressure gradient systems have been installed . These airflow systems , usually found only in hospitals ( where areas like operating rooms must be kept sterile ) , control the flow of clean air and contaminated air . The pressure of this forced air forms an invisible curtain through which airborne contaminants can not pass . The first floor of the building is devoted to public service facilities -- patient services , public health education , volunteer activities , and the detection clinic  --  and this will be my first stop . As there is no totally effective single test for detecting breast cancer , a comprehensive series of tests and evaluations to aid in the detection of breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a dressing room and instructed me to take off all my clothes and put on a marvelous little creation that has a permanent opening which permitted cold air to chill my backside to the point where I thought pneumonia might get me before cancer had a chance . For the next two hours medical experts took mymedical history . I forgot to tell them about my Great Aunt Annie , who lived to ninety-three , drove a car to the day she died , and attributed it all to Carter 's Little Liver Pills and henna rinse . Fantastic , wonderful Annie . Then a clinical examination . This was a careful and thorough medical evaluation , including breast palpation , analysis of urine specimens and recording of blood pressure , height , weight , and temperature . So far it was just the same old routine like a yearly physical , but then I was introduced to thermography : a graphic picture of varying heat temperatures at the breast surface under carefully controlled conditions that can signify cancerous development when higher temperatures are observed at specific locations . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth , and from several directions cold air , not uncomfortably so , reduces your body temperature and you are again reminded of the gap in your hospital-style wraparound which by then I was sure had been designed by a man who was either proud of his derriere or just terribly immodest . On to xeroradiography : a special mammography or X ray of the breast which produces finely detailed images under reduced levels of radiation . I had always had a cervical Pap smear , an analysis of cells in cervical fluids which is offered in addition to specific breast cancer detection testing each year , but a Pap smear of the breast was something new . This is a painless clinical sampling and evaluation of the cells in fluids of the breast . The last test was a blood test : the sampling and analysis of blood count , type and characteristics . t my tests were over , I was informed I experts would administer , supervise e results and findings , that clinical reports would be sent directly to my personal physician , and that all information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center are provided on the basis of pre-scheduled appointments . Cost for the complete series of tests , evaluations and clinical recording services is only $40 . Cheap enough for the peace of mind I will have after all the reports are in , It was a great day at the Center when Julie Nixon Eisenhower . having heard about my article , volunteered to take all the tests and lend her support to our worthy cause . She chatted with all the ladies and is sure ? ly the most delightful young woman I 've ever known . I hope other women will be encouraged by her example to take an active role in protecting themselves . While waiting for Julie to finish her examination , I learned from Dr. Brennan that breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in U.S. women , each year striking 73,000 and killing 32,000 . It is also the cancer which science knows the most about ; therefore , he feels there is a better chance of unlocking the sc crets of cancer through its study than in any other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the years , we 've found that a number of different factors seem to put certain women at a higher risk for breast cancer . Some of these factors have to do with age , others with childbirth , and still others with nationality . Here are some of the women we feel are at a higher risk for breast cancer : " Women who deliver their first child after the age of twenty-eight . The sisters , daughters and nieces of breast cancer patients . Post-menopausal women who are obese , have hypertension or who suffer from diabetes , " Women of North European ancestry , and especially Jewish women , as compared , for example , to women from the Latin countries . Women who have had any benign breast tumor or growth . " Now , this does n't mean that if a woman falls into any one or more of these categories , she 's guaranteed to have cancer . It 's just that we 've found that these women tend to be more susceptible to the disease . And , of course , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of breast cancer probably is . " Breast cancer , moreover , is more responsive to treatments already known than any other . And , since it can be hormone-related , scientists hope that when they truly understand it , they will also know how to deal with other hormone-related cancers  --  those in the uterus , ovaries , prostate and thyroid . For those practical reasons , research at the MCF is devoted to mammary cancers . But because breast cancer ( and other cancers ) seem to spring from several sources interacting with one another , research must also interact . At the Michigan Cancer Foundation , several scientific subdivisions work together , in a multidisciplinary fashion , in search of the causes of ( and ultimately of the cures for ) breast cancer . While a large part of MCF 's research is devoted to the study of viruses as a cause of breast cancer , scientists are also studying the roles of hormones , enzymes , and cancer-causing chemicals . Dr. Marvin Rich , who is a remarkably good teacher and a national figure in virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We know that viruses can induce breast cancer in experimental animals , " he said . " Several years ago the Michigan Cancer Foundation , cooperating with a number of research groups , pioneered an experiment which demonstrated that similar viruses could be seen in the milk of women who had a particularly high incidence of breast cancer . These findings initiated a research program aimed at a basic problem in breast cancer control  --  the identification of that portion of the population at high risk of breast cancer . " Toward this end , the Michigan Cancer Foundation 's Dr. Samuel Albert established an extensive human milk collection network which covers the entire Metropolitan Detroit area and is aimed at determining if the presence of characteristic virus in milk could be indicative of a woman 's risk of getting breast cancer . Until very recently , the efficient detection of these viruses at MCF and at other major cancer research centers was stymied by the severe problems involved in the detection of these minute viruses . Dr. Rich explained , however , that the results of a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to this problem may be at hand . Scientists at the MCF , with the support of the National Cancer Institute 's Virus Cancer Program , have developed an effective procedure for growing human breast cancer cells outside the body . Within the past few months , a group under the direction of Drs . Charles McGrath and Justin McCormick has isolated a virus from these cells which is similar to the virus that induces breast cancer in experimental animals . At present , the MCF scientists are working intensively to establish that the isolated viruses are indeed human breast cancer viruses . The availability of these cells and the ability to grow these viruses all at once provide the potential for making significant inroads into prevention , early diagnosis , and more effective therapy of breast cancer . Viruses grown in the cancer cell cultures will be used to initiate vaccine studies aimed at breast cancer prevention in high-risk women . Dr. Rich pointed out that hormonal therapy may be quite effective in the control of recurrent breast cancer following surgery . This kind of therapy seems to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to rapidly detect the presence of this protein in a patient 's cells would greatly facilitate the prompt administration of the appropriate type of therapy . It would also avoid the delay and risks involved in administering hormonal therapy to patients whose cancer is not linked to hormonal control . " The MCF human breast cancer cell line , " Dr. Rich pointed out , " was isolated from a patient with a hormone-sensitive tumor , and therefore they contain the key protein . The ability to grow these cells in large quantitites put us in a good position to develop rapid and sensitive tests for the detection of this substance , which could be routinely applied to all breast cancers . " In college I came closer to failing chemistry than any other subject , so talking with men as brilliant as Dr. Brennan and Dr. Rich about the advanced biology and chemistry involved in the study of breast cancer was like trying to become a brain surgeon through a correspondence course . From the two good doctors I was told that since approximately 50 percent of breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biochemical research is currently devoted to the female hormone , estrogen , and the pituitary hormones which work with it to drive the growth of these cancers . Taking advantage of the successful adaptation of human breast cancer cells and normal human breast cells to growth in test tubes achieved by Dr. Herbert Soule and Dr. Philip Furmanski at the Foundation in the last two years , Dr. Sam Brooks is leading his laboratory group in perfecting hormonal treatment of the disease . This kind of therapy can restore a woman to health , but the control of the disease now lasts only about a year . Dr. Brooks and others are attempting to perfect this method of chemotherapy to make it longer lasting . Another study involved with the hormone responsiveness of breast tumors utilizes organ cultures of fragments of actual tumors . MCF scientists keep the tumor tissue alive in a controlled environment ( an organ culture ) , and , using various hormones , run tests to see which hormonal mixture accelerates the cancer 's growth . When combined with specific measurements of the levels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to design treatment programs . While the biochemistry staff works to analyze the systems which promote tumor growth , the organic chemistry group designs specific chemicals to interfere with each step . Dr. Jerome P. Horwitz , a nationally known expert in the synthesis and design of such blocking drugs , has under test a series of new agents which he has developed for this purpose . To these learned men , I confessed that most of what they had said sounded wonderful , but if I have breast cancer , what is there for me now ? " Now " becomes the most important word to those who seek immediate help and relief . Dr. Brennan said , " Yes , I know , and while it is true that the major part of MCF 's permanent staff of 192 is working on research , one of the most vital functions of the Foundation is to make the cancer patient more comfortable , to offer her counseling , and help her gather together the pieces of her life after what may be emotionally devastating surgery . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patient services and rehabilitation . As I talked with others who have had a mastectomy , I was surprised when more women brought up the fear of a mutilated body than of the operation itself . Sharing her innermost thoughts , one lovely woman spoke of being so proud on her wedding night to give to her husband a full and healthy body , but now after twenty years of marriage , she could not face what she feared would be a lopsided , deeply distasteful cavern where once she had been soft and warm . This fear itself has cost the lives of so many women who have turned to those who have offered without scientific authority I00 percent cures . If a kindly person offered me a 100 percent cure , would I believe-or would I settle for the tried and true and proven ? In the back of my mind I recall how the medical profession laughed at Madame Curie as she and her husband searched for radium salts in 1898 ; and it was the subject cartoons when Dr. Jenner was using the pustules taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed the smallpox vaccine . The folkwives from Shropshire were " curing " dropsy for decades before an enlightened and fearless physican , Dr. William Withering , proved that these little ladies had given the world one of its most valuable **25;3586;TOOLONG from the lowly foxglove plant . Have the eyes and minds of today 's researchers remained open to all ideas ? What happens when someone mentions Dr. Linus Pauling 's theory of vitamin C in large doses being prophylactic in certain viral diseases ? Then there is Dr. issac Djerassi of Mercy Catholic Medical Center in Darley , Pennsylvania , who allows the use of an already available anticancer drug in extremely high doses , referred to in the press as the Dynamite drug . Doctors at Tulane University are discussing RF ( Recognition Factors ) and chemical threats , macrophages // which are scavenging on killed white blood cells . How , then , should one view all these new claims ? ( It appears that the press is announcing a miracle-a-minute from the American Cancer Society Science Writers Symposium . ) The answer seems to be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific merit . Drs . Rich and Brennan assured me that all cancer research institutions are cooperating , not to stifle discoveries , but to assure that research is done under controlled studies where the validity of the experiments is assured . It 's the only way to deal constructively with the reality of cancer . Breast cancer is curable only when it is treated early . If you suspect you have cancer , do n't delay treatment because you are afraid that the treatment will mutilate your body . Modern methods of treatment are not mutilating . They offer you a chance to live a full and happy life . For nearly a century , radical mastectomy , with or without irradiation , has been the accepted treatment of operable cancer of the breast . In the United States , although no longer in England or Scandinavia , it is still employed on the majority of patients with operable breast cancers , with overwhelming endorsement from the surgeons of this country . Lately it has become very popular to focus a great deal of attention on the patient 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oregon Supreme Court . Here they cited a physician 's duty to inform a patient of " material " risks inherent in a surgical procedure , and to disclose " feasible " alternative methods of treatment ( Jan. ? Feb. , 1972 ) . This was preceded by the California Supreme Court 's attempt to spell out a physician 's duty to tell about the choices of treatment available and the dangers involved ( American Medical News , December 18. 1972 ) . Shirley Temple Black wrote a story for McCall 's insisting that she " make the decision and the doctor could make the incision " concerning the type of operation she would have after the discovery of a malignancy in her breast . I admire Mrs. Black tremendously , but I am sure that once I placed my body into the hands of the most competent of surgeons , I would find myself leaving both the decision and the incision up to her or him , as the case may be , for down deep 1 feel they do n't want me to die and everything would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security and watching my children grow up . And if those two things do n't swing your decision to stick with the experts  --  think of your husband having a new wife , and having her going through your dresser drawers and closets . As I talked with Dr. Brennan , I said how easy it would be for a man to make the decision to remove a woman 's breast . How could he appreciate the psychic disturbance this could raise in a female ? Dr. Brennan said : " You know , when a woman is told she has to have a mastectomy , there 's a real conflict in her mind about whether she should trust what her doctor has told her . How can a man relate to loosing something which is so basically feminine ? If we were talking about amputating an arm or a leg , maybe this doctor would think twice ; maybehe would n't be so ready to cut . Well , I wo n't say these doubts are silly , because I know they 're very , very real . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : I am a man , yes ; but I 'm also a doctor . Trite as it may sound , I 'm interested in saving lives , and I know , beyond any reasonable doubt , that breast cancer kills . If you 've got a tumor in your breast and if your doctor tells you that the breast has to be removed , listen to him . What this is all about , is life or death  --  it 's just that simple . And if it 's male chauvinism to tell a woman she 's better off alive with one breast than dead with two breasts , then so be it . " As far as lumpectomy is concerned  --  that 's where only the tumor is removed from the breast  --  I wo n't say that it 's quackery , but I will say that , as a physician , I do n't think it 's responsible medicine . Just look at the facts . We know , for example , that one out of five breast cancers that we find is already multicentric when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors growing or starting to grow someplace else in the breast other than where the larger tumor was found . It just seems to be in the nature of at least some breast cancers that they begin in several different locations in the breast . Now , if you 're a woman with a lump in your breast , you can take that four-infive chance that it 's an isolated , more or less inactive tumor , if you want to . The odds are in your favor , probably . But I know if I were a woman I could n't live with that . And I know it would be a pretty solid shock to me if I did have a lumpectomy and then , a year or five years or ten years later , there was another lump . " Now , I 'm not saying that a woman should never have a breast tumor removed by ' lumpec-tomy . ' In some cases , this will work . But I just do n't think our diagnostic and analytical tools are sophisticated enough yet to let us tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumpectomy will save her life . In the future  --  and in the not-too-distant future , I hope  --  we 'll be able to begin identifying breast cancers more precisely and we 'll understand the particular characteristics of each tumor we find . We might soon be able to take a biopsy of a tumor and be able to say with pretty good assurance , ' This is n't a very active type of cancer , ' or ' This is a potentially high invasive type , ' which means that it 's a kind of cancer that spreads quickly . When we get these chemical and biological tools , then I 'll be much more willing to talk about lumpectomies . But until I can be a lot more certain than even 80 percent and until I can base my prognosis on a lot more than just statistical odds , I would never recommend this procedure . " Were there any surprises for me at the MPCRC ? You bet ! As I mentioned before , they run the biggest dairy in Detroit  --  better known as Project 92 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was simply taken from the last two digits of the project 's federal contract number . ) For the past year and a half , 2,000 women in Wayne , Oakland , Monroe , and Macomb counties have been combining breast feeding their babies with contributing to cancer research . Moreover , if you ask about these women , MCF scientists can supply you with a surprising number of facts about the state of health of their Aunt Minnies , their grandmas , and anyone in their families who ever had cancer . It 's all part of what may be the Michigan Cancer Foundation 's most unusual research project . Project 92 , reduced to its simplest terms , involves the collection of human breast milk from lactating mothers , the examination of this milk for virus particles like those known to cause breast cancer in mice , and the gathering of family health data from the participants in order to determine if women with a family history of cancer are more apt to harbor the virus particles than others . Every time a participant reports that a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital records , death certificates and other medical sources , to make certain they are receiving accurate information . Such checking involves letters and phone calls to all parts of the country . A few times , MCF researchers have even sent cemetery workers out to read grave markers for the date of death of someone 's relative  --  a necessary factor in obtaining death-certificate information from the state . Doggedness of this type has enabled MCF researchers to verify 93 percent of the breast cancers and 87 percent of other cancers reported in the Project 's nursing mothers ' families . Project 92 is carried out with the cooperation of thirty-four hospitals in the metropolitan Detroit area , and has been met with astonishingly positive reactions from the nursing mothers . In fact , only about a dozen women have refused to work with MCF , indicating perhaps a growing public awareness of the importance of breast cancer research . MCF also sends milk samples to research labs at Columbia University , The National Cancer Institute , and M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute for further studies . The project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future study of the prevention and detection of breast cancer . Scientists plan on using the cooperation pool of women in long-range follow-up studies , ranging perhaps for fifteen to twenty years . They hope that by closely follow-
