txt When a Senate clerk begins calling the roll next week for a vote on the first Panama Canal treaty , it will culminate one of the most massive and costly lobbying campaigns in American history . The approximate price tag , as compiled by this newspaper from figures supplied by the major groups involved : $2.7 million . That works out to an average investment of roughly $27,000 behind each " yea " and " nay " vote to be cast by the 100 senators . But in practice the money spent on the votes against ratifying the treaties outweighs the sums spent on the other side by a margin of better than 5 to 1 . Treaty opponents reckon they have spent $2.3 million , while proponents report outlays of $458,000 . " I 've got to hand it to them , " one pro-treaty lobbyist says of his anti-treaty rivals .

The American Conservative Union , a more established bastion of the political right , is close behind at nearly $1 million . The two leading spenders on behalf of the treaties are tightwads by comparison . The Committee of Americans for the Canal Treaties , headed by former Ford White House counselor John 0 . Marsh Jr. , has invested $300,000 . New Directions , a public-affairs lobby billed as a global counterpart to Common Cause , has expended $158,000 . The money on both sides has been poured largely into a " mailbox war " of nationwide direct-mail appeals asking recipients to send contributions and write letters to their senators . The top-spending Conservative Caucus . for example , has sunk three-quarters of its Panama funds into a direct-mail campaign . The pro-treaty groups have been outgunned on pieces of mail nearly as heavily as on overall spending dollars . They have sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters by New Directions .
