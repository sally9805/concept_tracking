txt And now we are confronted with musk oil , a craze . Musk oil is a perfume . It is touted as exotic and erotic , the answer to Ursula Ugly 's dreams , the perfume that will turn Mary Worth into a sex symbol , that will make Shroeder give up Beethoven for Lucy . It smells , some say , like stale sweat socks . But it sells like tickets to Raquel Welch 's dressing room . " Conservatively speaking , our business has jumped 10,000% . We have people who do nothing all day but fill musk-oil bottles , " says Ralph Taylor , vice president of Caswell-Massey Co. of New York , a major maker of musk oil . A man at Marshall Field &; Co. in Chicago says the big store is selling hundreds of halfounce , $5 bottles each week . " We 've run out so many times we do n't know how many we could have sold , " he says . Across America , about $1 million of musk oil is being snapped up each month , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uninitiated may ask . First of all , the musk oil we 're talking about has nothing to do with the musk deer an oddlooking little Asian animal that resembles Bambi with tusks . Real musk oil is a greasy secretion produced in a glandular sac beneath the skin of the stomach of the male musk deer , which smells as hideous as it sounds  --  until it is dried and cured into a powder . But real musk powder is more expensive than gold , and Marshall Field &; Co. would n't be in business long if , it peddled that at $5 per . The $5 musk oil is artificial , made from petroleum . ( But , for cars , Quaker State is less cosily  --  and smells just as good . ) Even though it is often promoted as " natural " and " genuine , " it is n't . Smells Bad , but Lasts Long Artificial musk oil , hereinafter referred to as musk oil , is powerful stuff . " It lasts for days , " says Regina Dwyer of New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk has a sour smell , " adds Miss Dwyer . Musk oil is said by some touts to be an aphrodisiac . But most people agree there 's no such thing as an aphrodisiac , and even more people agree that musk oil definitely is n't one . " It certainly has n't produced any results I 'm not used to , " delicately says Carol Taber , an advertising saleswoman in New York . She adds that " people are more aware of my scent , " but she does n't say if that 's good or bad . That 's good for Stevi Shipley , however . The shapely Miss Shipley is a bunny at the Playboy hutch in Chicago and she wears the earthysmelling musk oil . Her customers do n't particularly like it , she notes with approval . " I had been looking for something like it for a long time , " she explains , indicating that amorous men are an occupational hazard for rabbits . But some men must like it , because so many women are buying it . Which is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dana , which also peddles its own Canoe , expects to gross $500,000 to $1 million on Dana Musk Oil , which made its debut this month . Jovan Inc. of Chicago hopes to sell $2 million of its musk oil this year . Hubigant Inc. of New York will have an oil soon , and the giants , Faberge Inc. and Revlon Inc. , say they are keeping an eye , or a nose , on the market , though they have n't yet come out with a musk oil . The real kingpins of the musk-oil industry , though , are Caswell-Massey and RH Cosmetics Corp . of New York . Caswell-Massey apparently originated synthetic musk oil , but RH Cosmetics created the craze . A Graceless Loser Last April , an executive from RH Cosmetics discovered musk oil  --  probably Caswell-Mossey 's  --  at a Brooklyn boutique . Deciding that the fragrance had potential , RH teamed up with a perfumer. , formulated an oil and began promotion . To expand the market , the RH people encouraged other companies to sell musk oil and even sold their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musk oil for years among various other odd oils ( including something called cucumber emulsion ) , has harsh words for the RH product . " WE were the originators , " says Caswell-Massey 's Mr. Taylor . He says the RH oil is " absolutely worthless " and likens its smell to shoe polish because it lacks his firm 's special " aging process . " " That 's a lot of nonsense , " replies a man at RH , who contends there 's plenty of musk-oil business for everyone without petty squabbling . Meanwhile , the sellers of real musk powder are less than ecstatic . Their stuff , which is used in perfume , goes for about $4,000 a pound ? more than five times the price of gold  --  and most people would rather spend $4,000 on a matched set of Volkswagens than on musk oil . Real musk oil is so expensive because there are n't many male musk deer , because each male musk deer produces less than an ounce of musk oil and because the deer are in the Himalayas , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real musk oil are n't benefiting from the boom , and they 're not taking it gracefully . " The product they 're palming off as musk oil is n't musk oil at all , " says a musk-oil dealer . " At least we 're not killing off any deer , " replies a man at RH.
