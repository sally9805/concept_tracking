SAMUEL BECKETT : A BIOGRAPHY by Deirdre Bair Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 736 pages ; $19.95 <P> In 1971 a Columbia University Ph.D . candidate sent a letter to Samuel Beckett in Paris asking if she could write his biography . This was clearly a folly of youth and inexperience . Everyone knew that scholarly big guns on both sides of the Atlantic were lined up waiting for a shot at the Beckett biography , stymied only by what everyone knew : the Nobel prizewinner would never sit still for any prying into his personal life . <P> Yet Beckett did just that for Deirdre Bair . He said he would neither help nor hinder her , but then proceeded to do things that looked suspiciously like help : answering questions , writing letters of introduction , letting friends and associates know that they could cooperate or not with the young biographer as they pleased . Many hundreds did , and Biographer Bair had six years of work cut out for her . They were worth it . Samuel Beckett could have come swaddled in doctoral dissertationese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , the book is a model of judicious , lively scholarship , an impressive translation of an enigma into a man . <P> The large facts of Beckett 's life are fairly well known , and Bair adds nothing major to them . But her accretion of small details softens the hard edges of Beckett 's known past and published works . Born into a prosperous Irish Protestant family in 1906 , Beckett was a crashingly normal , if sometimes diffident lad up through his graduation from Trinity College , Dublin . His skill with languages brought him a two-year fellowship in Paris and the promise of a teaching post at Trinity when he finished . In Paris , Beckett joined the circle of acolytes surrounding James Joyce ; the young Irishman 's first published work was an essay championing his senior countryman . Joyce 's daughter Lucia , who was drifting into the schizophrenia that would eventually disable her , fixated on Beckett as a soul mate . She knew her man . <P> Back in Dublin , Beckett at first played the weary Continental poseur , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bum . The cause was a crippling depression that left him spending weeks bed , curled in the fetal position , his body racked with apparently psychosomatic symptoms : boils , cysts , headaches , flu , bursitis . Beckett tried to fight by drinking heavily and flying into periodic rages . When these attempts failed , he began cultivating an air of contemptuous indifference to the world and its pains . " All I want to do , " he told a friend , " is sit on my ass and fart and think of Dante . " <P> He did much more , of course . He wrote furiously , turning out book after book that the world ignored . Murphy , his first novel , was rejected by 42 publishers . He complained bitterly : " I do not feel like spending the rest of my life writing books that no one will read . It was not as though I wanted to write them . " Compulsively , he kept on . Not until age 47 , when Waiting for Godot created a sensation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Samuel Beckett performed some brave work with the French Resistance during World War II : He married a woman seven years his senior in 1961 after having lived with her for amost a quarter-century.
