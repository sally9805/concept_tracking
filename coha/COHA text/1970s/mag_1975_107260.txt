Building up to the proper speed for a big Sunday event is an accepted fact of motor racing life , but there are a few times when a driver almost feels like sidling warily up to his car . Last Friday was the 13th , as everyone noted , perhaps not the best time for the superstitious to buckle into the cramped cockpit of an evil-tempered 500-hp projectile called a Formula 5000 car . But it had to be done , as surely as the series must go on , since Formula 5000 is nothing if not dedicated to success . For one thing , this formula has yet to become a household word , even to hard-core motor racing freaks . It is a mere stripling compared with other open-wheel , single-seat racing machines like Indianapolis or Formula I cars , both of which have been around longer than all but the most enthusiastic automotive archivists can recall . // One had to empathize with the small band of jittery drivers who prepared for practice and qualifying at the Mosport , Ontario road course on that ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with specific fears regarding such items as green cars , peanut shells and the number 13 . But they also are solidly addicted to the limelight , which might prompt them to stroll under ladders and let black cats cross their bows , provided the audience is large enough . Run at Le Mans or Daytona on Friday the 13th ? Of course , because should disaster strike , at least one would make a properly spectacular departure , witnessed by a large audience and chronicled by a worldwide press . But to buy it in a Formula 5000 car at Mosport , Ontario , on a dreary , rain-spattered day on the perimeter of the Canadian wilderness with a ragged collection of fellow drivers , mechanics and a few track officials in attendance , would embody just about as much G ? tterd ? mmerung-Bonanza drama as slipping in the bathtub. // Their faces starched with concern , American superstars like Bobby Unser , his kid brother Al , and Mario Andretti , plus English aces Jackie Oliver , David Hobbs and 1974 Formula 5000 champion Brian Redman squirmed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spread over the adjacent forested ravines and hummocks was the 2.46 miles of Mosport , perhaps the most challenging loop of macadam in North America . // With the low clouds shedding a chill mist , the old pros sought speed cautiously on the nasty , off-camber corners and the humpty-dumpty straightaway , where 180 mph comes in a series of stomach-churning darts and swoops through the stands of pines and softwoods . Mosport severely punishes the impulsive , as Danny Ongais quickly discovered . This taciturn young man , a former drag-racing star accustomed to 220-mph thrusts down the quarter-mile , had embarked on his rookie year in Formula 5000 with an impressive performance in the season 's opener at Pocono , Pa . But a few laps at Mosport did him in . Looping off a roller-coaster , downhill right , Ongais whacked the guardrail with sufficient force to pulverize his shiny new Lola and keep him wedged in the wreckage for painful minutes . He was carted off to a nearby hospital , but fortunately escaped serious injury , as did his associates who also spent the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly after practice picked up again following Ongais ' crash , Redman , who is renowned for his tidy manners with superfast automobiles , stuffed his Lola into a fence when a slower car blocked his line . Al Unser , Ongais ' teammate , Californian John Woodner , and Indiana sportsman Evan Noyes then bent their cars in a three-car shunt , which caused even the most confirmed rationalists in the pits to start groping for their rabbit 's feet . // The only man on the premises who remained unflappable was the slight , soft-spoken Andretti , one of the fastest , most versatile drivers in the history of motor sports . Before rain turned the final practice session into a low-speed skating party , Andretti steered his Parnelli Jones-owned Lola around Mosport at an average of 120.7 mph , which was just fractionally slower than the track 's outright record held by a Formula 1 Ferrari . This velocity was somewhat amazing , because Formula 5000 machines , with their heavier , bulkier bodies and less sophisticated , Detroit-built , production-type engines are supposed to be fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prix cars . Does an alarm clock keep better time than a chronograph ? Is an off-the-rack dress more glamorous than a Paris original ? Of course not . Nor is a little-celebrated 5000 car expected to rival a Grand Prix racer unless it is operated by a man like Andretti , who is the only driver to have recorded victories in Formula I , Formula 5000 and Indianapolis-type machinery . // " This 5000 series is still a child , " Mario said as he crawled out of his red and white car . " It started as a second-class event and operated in the shadow of the old Can-Am sports car races for a long time . But now the Can-Am is gone and 5000 is the premier road racing series in North America . And the cars are technically very sophisticated . I think Formula 5000 has tremendous potential . " // " I think it needs help , " groused Bobby Unser , whose specialty is driving Dan Gurney 's Indy-winning Eagle championship car . Through a crazy-quilt sanctioning setup , Indy cars also can run Formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must make a mandatory pit stop , which nullifies their use . Formula I cars , which are about 150 pounds lighter than 5000 cars and produce approximately 50 hp less from their smaller engines , are not eligible to compete in 5000 . " The promotion needs improvement , " Unser said . " You 've got a lot of big names in this series , but the whole thing is n't being sold effectively . " // The Indy champ 's reservations notwithstanding , the Mosport management had indeed done some heavy selling , attracting a crowd of perhaps 60,000 by race time . After a Saturday devoted to sports car racing , the weather cleared and the track 's infield pastures became spotted with thousands of tents populated by a milling mob soaked with equal parts of sun and beer . The spectacle they came to witness was divided into three parts : a pair of 62.5-mile qualifying heats and a 125-mile grand finale involving , theoretically at least , the top finishers in the two preliminaries . In reality a modest 27 Formula 5000 machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Friday and six others suffered a variety of mechanical problems ) , which meant that the remaining 18 cars that were able to wobble to the starting grid were all assured of spots in the $55,000 main event . // This system is not popular with the star drivers . Andretti seemed to express the consensus by observing , " Qualifying heats are essentially minor league . These races should be run like an Indy or Grand Prix race : one big go with everything on the line . At the very least we ought to be running a pair of 125-milers with an overall winner . " // Following the flurry of rasping sound and blurred color that composed the two heats , each one zinging through in about 32 minutes , the Mosport 5000 feature began to assume a familiar form . The seven races held during 1974 had been dominated by Andretti and Redman , each of whom won three , with Redman snatching the championship by a few points in the final contest . This year 's event at Pocono also was taken by Redman after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Andretti had his Lola on its best behavior at Mosport . He won the opening heat in effortless fashion , loafing home 32 seconds ahead of young Australian Warwick Brown . Redman followed former Can-Am champion Jackie Oliver for seven laps of the second preliminary , then breezed to an easy win after Oliver 's sinister black UOP Shadow suffered an electrical failure . Bobby Unser soldiered on to second place in the Gurney-Eagle , seemingly lacking the power to catch the smooth-running Redman , whose Lola had magically regained its top form following its Friday crunch . // The main event was launched amidst widespread expectations for yet another Andretti-Redman struggle , and the enthusiastic crowd was not disappointed . Mario leapt away from the pole position with Redman glued to his spoiler . The entire 40 laps of the race were run in that order , Andretti cranking out a smooth 116.4 mph average . Mario , now slightly pudgier but no less aggressive than when he burst on the racing scene a decade ago , was impeccable . Redman drove fiercely , probing for weak spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I could catch him unless he had trouble . It was that simple , " Redman admitted after the race . Andretti screeched across the line a mere half second in front with Redman sliding wide on the final corner in one last fling to catch up . Warwick Brown finished a lap back in third , barely holding off a charging David Hobbs , who had surged up from a starting spot in the middle of the pack . // A man who seemed quietly pleased with the whole affair was Jim Hall , the rangy Texan whose famed Chaparral dominated sports car racing in the mid- ' 60s . Now retired from driving and content with co-ownership of Redman 's car ( with Chicagoan Carl Haas , who is the American distributor for the English-built Lola racers ) , Hall said , " This series makes about as much sense as anything in big-time racing today . A guy can field a good car , with spare engines , mechanics and such for about $125,000 for the whole darn season . And that is a fraction of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are pretty neurotic about the economy , which has hurt sponsorship , but I believe the long-range future of Formula 5000 is pretty darn bright . " // So these rapid upstarts , with their bellowing stock-block engines , may lack the panache of their Indy and Grand Prix cousins , but in terms of sheer , eyeball-bulging , eardrum-busting , automotive drama , they give way to nobody . And that sort of assault on the senses is what motor racing is all about .
