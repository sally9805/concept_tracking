THE scene : Edinburgh airport . A lass working for the British Board of Trade and assigned to quiz every 30th arriving passenger flips open her pad . <P> " What is the reason for your visit ? " <P> " Business , politics , winning an election , " replies the pink-cheeked gentleman . <P> " How long has your firm been in business ? " <P> " Since the time of Benjamin Disraeli . " <P> " What is your final destination ? " <P> " No. 10 Downing Street . " <P> Only then did she recognize Edward ( " Ted " ) Heath , 53 , leader of the Conservative Party and aspirant Prime Minister . Last week 's Edinburgh encounter was symptomatic of the plight of Ted Heath and his embattled Tories , who have been out of office for nearly six years . As Britain this week prepares to go to the polls in the eighth general election since 1945 , Heath stands scant chance of moving into 10 Downing Street . Instead , British bookies were giving odds as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister in the last 100 years to lead his party to three consecutive electoral victories . <P> Polls Ahead . For four days last week , Britain 's newspaper-loving public was deprived of reading about the politicking . Eleven national papers were closed by a strike , and election buffs were reduced to crowding around the telly for their news . When the papers reappeared , after settling on a 10% pay increase , they reported opinion samplings showing that Labor had increased its lead by as much as 12.4% . It was a remarkable turnaround ; a year ago , Labor trailed the Tories by as much as 26.8% . Wilson 's current lead-if it stands up - would give the party a massive 140-seat majority in the Commons . That would be an even greater Labor victory than the one in 1966 that resulted in a 96-seat edge in the Commons . <P> <P> Some Laborites , in fact , were concerned that the party 's overconfident supporters would feel it unnecessary even to vote on June 18 . This would present the well-organized Tory machine with an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin , or perhaps , in the highly unlikely event of a reversal of Labor fortunes , even squeak through to an upset triumph . <P> Ducking Issues . In the final week of campaigning , Wilson , usually accompanied by his wife Mary , billowed through the hustings , laughing off barrages of eggs , bags of talcum powder , Tory hecklers and even a bolt of lightning that struck his train at Attenborough . Heath , whistling across the sceptred isle in an executive prop jet . plugged away at his efforts to swing 49 key marginal constituencies away from Labor . But Heath was unable to match Wilson 's jaunty confidence . He did unbend enough toward the campaign 's end to drink with workers in pubs and buss young girls . Nonetheless . Heath sniffed . " I do n't regard this election as a competition between n couple of circus masters . " <P> If Wilson gave little heed to the issues , voters paid less attention to Heath 's attempts to raise them . For one thing , the British were distracted by the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team is defending its championship title .
