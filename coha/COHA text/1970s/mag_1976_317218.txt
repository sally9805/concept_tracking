The trumpets sounded , the drums were thumped , and the jubilant crowds burst out singing-to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic- " Ronny , Ronny , Ronald Reagan , his truth goes marching on . " " I believe in miracles , " the former California Governor said during one of the celebrations last week , " but I also believe you 've got to ootch them along a bit . " The resurrection of Reagan 's half-dead presidential campaign in four straight primary victories was undeniably something of a miracle , but keeping watch on Reagan as he ootched it along required quite a bit of ootching on the part of the two dozen TIME correspondents assigned to different parts of the ever changing battlefield this year . <P> One typical shift last week moved the Washington bureau 's Strobe Talbott , 30 , who translated the Khrushchev memoirs , out into the Reagan campaign . Said Talbott : " I picked up the Reagan road show on Sunday in Indianapolis , and since then I 've visited 14 cities and towns in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 rallies , fund raisers , press conferences , and town-hall meetings . He has quite a repertory of mother-in-law jokes , folk tales in an Irish brogue , farm stories involving cows and milk buckets , and by now I know them so well that I 've even started to dream his opening jokes in my dreams-when I 've had a chance to sleep , that is . My only casualty from this constant traveling , though , was the winding stem on my wristwatch , which I broke by resetting the watch so often for changes in time zones . " <P> Campaigning with Reagan also meant hectic hours for National Political Correspondent Robert Ajemian , who interviewed the candidate in a car driving through Shreveport , La. , then boarded a plane that blew out a tire , and finally reached New York at 4 a.m. to deliver his Q. and A. with Reagan . In Washington , Dean Fischer covered the Ford side of this week 's cover stories . <P> Putting it all together each week is the task of the seven writers and eight reporter-researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the aid of Senior Editor Ronald Kriss . Says Loeb : " Few stories in recent history have had so many twists , turns and unexpected outcomes as this campaign . But maybe TIME readers are less surprised than other people because we 've long been saying that the voters are in an independent mood , and this is an anything-can-happen year . "
