Eliot Feld 's new ballet , Variations on " America , " is a series of opinions . " This is what I think . Is n't that surprising ? " asks Feld , 34 , a brilliant choreographer who seems mildly baffled by his witty , ribald new dance . " This ballet concerns some of my feelings about us , about America . It 's he tests the word syllable by syllable op-ti-mis-tic . " <P> The atmosphere was jubilant when Feld unveiled his seven-minute romp through Americana at Manhattan 's City Center last week . It was the first Broadway run for the troupe that Joseph Papp has housed at the Public Theater for all of its nearly three-year existence . This time the company danced to a real orchestra , playing in the pit , instead of to a solo piano or a tape . The stars were Christine Sarry , Feld 's favorite ballerina , and Guest Artist Mikhail Baryshnikov . <P> Though it is a bit late for the Bicentennial , patriotic spirits ran high . The score , originally a Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It bounced along with marchlike rhythms and even a saucy flamenco . Allusions to country and flag abounded in Thomas Skelton 's starry light projections and Willa Kim 's red , white and blue costumes . Pinching years into seconds required lightning transformations by Sarry and Baryshnikov . Pioneers became Indians , who eventually turned into Central Park joggers . More than ever , Feld 's choreography demanded speed and lucidity . Darting here and there in prickly little pas phrased right on the music , Sarry would suddenly spin out in a phosphorescent series of turns . Then she and Baryshnikov led a smart cakewalk . He threw a snappy salute and then , breaking free , rocketed through the air in flashing cabrioles that made the audience gasp . <P> Many steps came straight from the ballet manual . Others have never been seen before : Misha 's good-natured fanny squeeze-his own derrire-and a figure in which Yankee Doodle scoops up Sarry to ring the Liberty Bell . Compression and speed obscured some of the complexity of the choreography . Baryshnikov , as always , appeared to be dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the orchestra struck up a flourish reminiscent of the old Path newsreel finale , Baryshnikov lofted Sarry high in a grand one-handed Kirov lift . Majestically , he floated her on a cushion of air , then plunged her straight to the floor in a resounding split . It looked more painful than spectacular . <P> Variations on " America " is " a blue-sky , apple-pie kind of ballet . If it misses the intensity of some of Feld 's longer works , it also lacks their some times disturbing undertones . A circus of bravura set pieces , it may well join Le Corsaire , Don Quixote and similar pas de deux as staples of gala pro grams . Variations is bound to tempt other virtuoso pairs . There are two reasons , however , why it may not look quite the same : Christine Sarry and Mikhail Baryshnikov . <P> Joan Downs
