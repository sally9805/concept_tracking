txt WASHINGTON  --  If President Nixon still is pursuing his policy of unrestricted air strikes in Indochina a year from now , he will he opposed in the Republican Presidential primaries  --  and that could turn out to be the biggest joke since Eugene McCarthy took on President Johnson in 1968 . One year to the day before . the New Hampshire primary ( March 7 , 1972 ) , the all-but-certain challenger is an intense young ( 43 ) Republican Congressman from the peninsula area south of San Francisco , Paul N. ( Pete ) McCloskey . He says flatly that he 's going to make the race unless he can get someone else to do it . That will not be easy , and besides , in this age of the quick build-up , Pete McCloskey might be the most formidable Republican Nixon-challenger available . A Marine reserve colonel who fought in Korea and holds the Navy Cross , the Silver Star and the Purple Heart , he has just the right background for an antiwar campaign  --  and will even dismay some doves with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead in strategic weaponry . Mr. McCloskey proved in his upset Congressional victory over Shirey Temple in 1967 that he is a smashing TV performer , and Spiro Agnew can hardly call him a " radic-lib . " He supported Mr. Nixon for the Presidency in 1960 ( although Ile worked for Nelson Rockefeller the last time around ) , served on the Republican " truth squad " in 1968 , and has a record of legislative support for the President that he says is bettered by only 11 per cent of his House Republican colleagues . Like lots of good Republicans , he also worries that the war has pushed Mr. Nixon into deficit spending . " For such reason ' , and because he IN THE E INATIOIV is from California , not the " Eastern Establishment , " Mr. McCloskey probably would not be quite the red flag in the face of Republican regulars that , say , Mayor Lindsay of New York would be . And while the Congressman says he might . take bolder stands than Mr. Nixon 's on race and environmental questions , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indochina and the deceptions by which he believes it has been widened and sustained in this and the last Adminis-tration , A challenge to an incumbent President from within his own party always seems quixotic ( although not as much as it did before 1968 ) . But a Republican primary campaign in 1972 , by a candidate with Mr. McCloskey 's assets , might prove a serious matter for Mr. Nixon . For one thing , it would mean that a direct and personal challenge to the President on his Indochina policy would be mounted six to eight months before a Democratic candidate could do it ; until after that party 's convention , its hordes of candidates will be debating mostly among themselves . For another thing , Mr. McCloskey 's would be a fresh voice in an old debate , and he is not interested in arguing some of the old familiar questions so much as the one he now sees as most pressing  --  the inhumanity of the war . In a powerful antiwar speech in the House last month , Mr. McCloskey as a lawyer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration , but denounced its battlefield methods : " Having lost the stomach for fighting this war and suffering the casualties involved , " he said , " we have ernwn lin accept the idea of hiring mercenaries to do our fighting . .. . Less than 25 years after Nuremberg , where we insisted that the wanton destruction of villages and the ? forced relocation of civilians should be considered war crimes against humanity , we adopted the same sort of tactics . " And he condemned the view " that it is all right to destroy the villages and people of small countries like Laos and Cambodia. , if we only do it through air power , rather than . . . where those who pull the triggers actually see the people they are killing . " That kind of argument from a decorated marine via television to a warweary people Is not to be lightly discounted .. Presidents have trouble defending themselves in state primaries anyway ; they seldom wish to get into " undignified " campaigns , or debate their policies with lesser mortals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McCarthy-Johnson episodes suggest that voters , are often ' happy to rebuff an incumbent President for the general state of things , when their primary votes will not actually turn him or his party out of office . On that basis alone , Mr. McCloskey could hope to make a good showing in several primaries , including New Hampshire . He has a particular eye on Rhode Island . That might not be an unmixed blessing for the antiwar cause . Suppose Mr. Nixon were already in trouble in 1972 on the economy and the war ; if he also suffered some damaging primary defeats and withdrew , as Mr. Johnson did , or lost control of his party , a conservative Republican convention might more nearly turn to Gov . Ronald Reagan of California than to a dovish insurgent . That possibility worries Pete McCloskey . But if he enters the primaries , he says , he 'll enter them allinclutling California 's , against the regul*r Reagan-led delegation .                    @
