LIVING WELL IS THE BEST REVENGE by Calvin Tomkins . 148 pages . Viking . $6.50 . <P> Just before Tender Is the Night was published in 1934 , Scott Fitzgerald mused to his friend Gerald Murphy , who served as one of the models for Dick Diver : " It has magic . It has magic . " It was indeed a seductive book , and a nimbus of equally powerful magic surrounded its author . Though Scott squandered his talent and Zelda went mad , legend still holds firmly that they were enchanted people somehow removed from the dailiness of life . <P> It may be that the legend springs less from the frantic Fitzgeralds than from Gerald and Sara Murphy , the subjects of this immaculate essay . The first hundred pages of Tender Is the Night evoke a world nearly as lyrical as Keats ' vision of embalmed darkness and sunburnt mirth , and it was a world palpably created by the Murphys . For nearly a decade , artists of all sorts enjoyed a respite from their messy lives in the company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole Porter-all were drawn to the couple before the Fitzgeralds arrived in France . <P> Both Murphys were from wealthy American merchant families : her father sold ink , his owned the luxury leather store Mark Cross . Neither was quite happy in the usual mold of puritanical work and social aggrandizement . Falling in love was a mutual recognition of aim . " I feel as if we had registered at the office of Civilization a claim to a place in the world and that it had been granted , " Gerald wrote his fiancee . <P> The claim was located in Antibes . The Murphys arrived in France with three toddling children in 1921 . Cole Porter introduced them to the Cte d'Azur , then unheard of as a summer resort . Delighted with it , the Murphys purchased a house they named Villa America and cleared a stretch of beach called La Garoupe . Gerald painted huge , careful canvases that are fascinating precursors of Pop art . But both the Murphys were more interested in a life of quality and beauty than in art . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tender Is the Night , " was spaced like the day of older civilizations to yield the utmost from the materials at hand and give all the transitions their full value . " <P> Sara 's flowers and her food were exquisite distillations of the seasonal crops . Gerald 's daily attire , bought at a seamen 's supply store , became the resort uniform : white duck trousers , striped jersey , the sailor 's work cap that Scott called a jockey cap in the novel . What set the Murphys apart was a special , large-minded devotion to each other and to their friends . Dos Passos called the marriage " unshakable-everyone was at his best around the Murphys . " Though she was notably candid with them , Sara in particular doted on her friends : " It was n't parties that made it such a gay time , " she said . " There was such affection between everybody . You loved your friends and you wanted to see them every day . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
