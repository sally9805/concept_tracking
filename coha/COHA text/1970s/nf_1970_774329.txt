txt  | day morning , why ask him to wash all of the inside window glass at that particular time when you have at least four other alternatives : ask for his help another , more likely time ; get somebody else to wash the windows ; wash them yourself ; or forget about them . If you use your head in asking your husband for help , it is highly unlikely that you will strip him of his manhood ? peeling potatoes wo n't puncture his pride , nor washing windows dilute his status . Any good schedule is built around the special needs and preferences of the people it is to serve . Your schedule will reflect your own standards , your husband 's attitudes , your children 's ages and interests , your financial situation , where you live , and other factors unique to your family . Do n't be discouraged if your first schedules seem confining or burdensome .

You could not hope to have lists and schedules all operating smoothly in a week or so . It might take weeks just to get menu cards lined up so that grocery lists and marketing are easier to do , but such menu cards are certainly worth doing . It might take weeks to get a morning routine that fits all the family members , but such a routine is certainly worth working toward . A schedule can not work without a great deal of determination , especially at first , but the rewards are great : confidence and peace of mind that come from an orderly pattern of dealing with daily necessities . Most people who scoff at schedules are either not faced with the necessity of handling a great deal of activity in a limited amount of time or else they have not stuck with a schedule long enough to reap its rewards .

They are a must for the working mother if she is to keep control of her time , get her work done efficiently and eliminate the time wasted in indecisiveness .

A schedule makes you master of the day rather than a victim of it .  | WHAT 'LL I HAVE FOR DINNER ? Though some women say they hate to cook , usually it 's not the actual cooking that bothers them . They are just especially susceptible to the " What 'll I have for dinner ? " syndrome . The acute stage of this disease occurs in late afternoon when the victim still has n't the slightest idea what she will serve for dinner that night , although she has been vaguely worrying about it ever since she finished dinner the night before . 1 i Menu planning can save countless hourspf such mental stewing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can find and hire a cook of your own . Few women , working or not , have any but the most superficial idea of what they will be cooking the following week , and family-tailored sets of menus are practically nonexistent . It is easy to understand why a lot of women say they hate to cook . Yet , you do not have to have an extensive set of menus'to provide for a variety of meals . A three- or four-week menu  | cycle involves the main courses and accompaniments for only twenty to thirty dinners . Breakfast menus can be amply varied with as few as five to seven entrees . ( Many people prefer a standard breakfast , though in families lucky enough to boast a good and willing cook in the house , this is seldom the case . ) The assembly of your menus will not seem overwhelming if you consider the individual parts of the meals one at a time . On separate 5 by 8 file cards ( from an office-supply store ) , list each dish of every meal you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be choosing from these cards in a mix-and-match fashion when doing the menumaking for the week . Include on each card the recipe or the ingredients needed whether you know them by heart or not . This notation will be useful when you are making your grocery lists . If there are particular relishes , condiments or other accompaniments that you especially like with any dish , note that information down , too . Leave space for recording any prepared-in-advance dishes that you have in the freezer . Also list what parts of the preparation can be done in advance . Include cards for each dish , even the simplest-to-prepare items , such as baked potatoes . Each card will flash an idea for you when you are menu-making . Many women draw a blank on what to have for dinner because they depend on nothing more than sifting vaguely through their minds in search of ideas . Your cards will be like a catalog that you can browse through to make your choices . As you come across new dishes that you like , add to your cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are an adventurous cook , old favorites can sometimes fade from memory if they are not kept filed along with the new entries . Do not add a card for any dish until you have tried it , and it has passed a family taste test .  | To make your set of menu cards , simply sit down with a stack of file cards and a pen and begin with the dishes you already know and like . You will soon be filling in the basic categories and coming up with a list that will suit your family 's preferences and pocketbook . Your menus may fall something short of haute cuisine , but they will be infinitely better than most of the prepared frozen dinners you might be inclined to pull from the supermarket freezer when that " What 'll I have for dinner ? " feeling strikes . This is not to say that convenience foods do not have a place in your menus or on your grocery lists . They can save you valuable time in the cleaning , peeling , squeezing , slicing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go along with food preparation . If you choose convenience foods with some degree of discrimination , for what they deliver for their cost and the time they save , no one need turn up his nose at an inferior meal . There are , of course , grades of quality in convenience foods ; many of them are also much improved from what they were when they were first introduced . Working mothers need to be adventurous in trying new convenience foods as they come along so that they will know which ones fit their needs and tastes . You can then count on those , such as dehydrated chopped onions , that save time in the preparation of meals and those that might serve adequately for a quick meal in themselves , such as a Welsh rarebit the children enjoy when you and your husband are going out for the evening . For your dinner menu cards you will have five categories to consider : ( 1 ) protein ( meat , poultry , fish , milk , eggs , cheese , peas and beans ) ; ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as macaroni and noodles ) ; ( 3 ) green , yellow and other vegetables ; ( 4 ) salads ; and ( 5 ) desserts , if you like . Work on the menu categories one by one . First , there is  | the protein group , usually your main course . You might think of seven beef entrees your family likes : Swiss steak , pot roast , beef Stroganoff , Chinese pepper steak , boeuf bourguignon , liver , hamburgers . From pork , choose four : chops , spareribs , baked ham and ham steak . From lamb , plan two : shoulder roast and ragout . From veal , two : braised shoulder and scaloppine . Poultry is cheap and versatile enough for five main courses : roast , breasts supreme , fried , cacciatore , smothered with shallots , turkey roll roast . From seafood start with three : broiled fillets , a salmon mousse or loaf , oyster stew ; from eggs-milk-and-cheese : baked macaroni and cheese , eggs Florentine ; from the legumes , two : baked lima beans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several good one-dish meals that can be used to handle any leftover meat , poultry or seafood . For example , list such dishes as ham or turkey tetrazzini , fried rice with meat or seafood . A word of caution about leftovers : plan not to have any unless they are planned . There is not much point to menu planning if you are constantly winding up with leftovers that you must use up in some way . Leftovers are just one more thing for working mothers to worry about , unless you know ahead ? on your menu list ? what you are going to do with them . A larger-than-usual pork roast with enough left over for pork fried rice is money in the bank when it is planned for . Leftover cold roast chicken for Saturday 's lunch puts you way ahead before Saturday ever comes . With this sort of planning , you buy only what you need for your menus and , except for emergencies , you stick to them . After you have your main-course cards completed , begin on the next category : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards at least six variations for potatoes : for example , baked , mashed , boiled new , an gratin , lyonnaise and  | oven-fried ; include several for rice : steamed , pilaff , risotto ; and others , such as noodles , parslied , green and cheesed . Include at least eight cards for green or yellow vegetables : carrots in lemon-butter sauce , asparagus , green peas and onions , green beans with bacon bits , braised Brussels sprouts , spinach , corn pudding , baked acorn squash . Add several other vegetable choices : glazed onions , broiled eggplant , scalloped tomatoes . Have ten or twelve salads on your cards ? they can sometimes substitute for vegetables or for dessert or even for main courses : tossed green , cucumbers and sour cream , tomatoes or asparagus vinaigrette , pickled beet and hardcooked egg , salad Nicoise , Caesar salad , carrot-nut-andraisin , fruit , tole slaw , waldorf , macaroni , stuffed celery and cottage cheese . As for desserts , you can plan from zero to a dozen as it suits you ? from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit and cheese , to cakes and pastries as you can work them in . One way to cut down on desserts and still keep a dessert-oriented family happy is to plan a " special " for once-aweek , for Sunday dinner perhaps . The children often enjoy the occasion as much as the dessert . After you have finished cards for each category in the dinner menus ? main dish , potato-rice-pasta , vegetable , salad , and dessert ? make up separate cards for breakfast dishes and for school and weekend lunches if you need them . When you have separate cards for each dish for each meal , the cards can then be arranged in index sections like this : Dinners Main dishes Potatoes , rice , pasta Vegetables  | Salads Desserts Breakfasts Fruit and juices Main course Beverages ( if children enjoy variety ; i.e. , hot chocolate , hot tea , milk , etc . ) School Lunches Main course Snacks Desserts Beverages Weekend Lunches ? From these cards will come your master menus of meals for the week . For dinners , you simply pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potato-rice-pasta , the vegetable , the salad and the dessert , that you wish to serve for each day of the coming week , and line them up in order . Do the same for breakfasts and lunches . If you are menu-making on Friday night , then start your menus off with Saturday and run through to the following Friday . The cards you have pulled are now the basis for not only your grocery list but also a preparation list that will indicate the things you can do ahead of time to get each dish as far along toward being ready as possible . For example , if you have selected a gelatin salad for Wednesday 's dinner , you will note on your Tuesday schedule , " Make salad for tomorrow night . " This you can do while you are cleaning up after dinner Tuesday night . Most working mothers would agree that this is a sensible , almost obvious system , but few women actually operate this way . The major problem is in getting the dishes down on menu cards so that you will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may take weeks for you to get a  | complete set of cards put together ( unless you have more uninterrupted time available than most working mothers ) , but keep at them , even if it means doing only two or three a day . Once you have a set of menu cards , the rest of the job of menu planning , marketing and cooking is much , much easier . With a menu and grocery-shopping and food-preparation schedule working together , you may wind up spending perhaps only half an hour in overall planning for the week . Not once during the rest of the week will you have to wonder what you will have for dinner . You will know not only what you are having but also when you will have the time to prepare it . After you know your menu cards well enough , the working up of the grocery list and the preparation schedule become almost automatic . Even more important , should someone have to take over for you ? husband , family friend , older child or hired help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can follow with a minimum of confusion . If you are sick or must be away from home , those menu cards can be of enormous comfort to you and a great help to the person who takes your place in the kitchen . After you have a working set of menu cards , you are ready to take on the grocery list and the marketing in an organized way . A few simple rules can help here , too . When you are making up your grocery list , check the recipes on the menu cards to make certain which ingredients you have on hand and which you will need . Be certain ; check the recipes and check your cupboards . For the staples you may need , keep a running list in the kitchen and note down an item as it is used up ? flour , sugar , ketchup , paper towels , etc . Also , group together items from the same department in the grocery store on the list . Have an organized pattern for shopping instead of rolling your cart aimlessly up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Main Dish Dinner Serves : 6 Beef with Green Peppers Preparation : figure  | find it an interesting diversion ? some women do , but they are usually not working mothers . Start your shopping at the meat department so that the butcher can prepare whatever you might need ? beef ground , roast rolled ? while you are finishing the rest of the marketing . Keep a pattern of selecting canned and packaged goods for the bottom of the basket , then dairy items , then back to pick up the meat order , and last the fresh produce and frozen foods . At the checkout counter , your groceries can be grouped easily according to storage place at home ? freezer , refrigerator , cupboards or pantry ? as you take them out of the basket . Ask to have each group put in a separate bag , and you will find it much easier and quicker to store the items at home . ( Watch out with canned goods ; if there are more than a few cans the grocery bag will be too heavy to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groceries as you wish them if you have the items organized so that you do n't hold up the line . r Two other much-quoted pieces of advice are worth quoting again . Do n't go to the grocery store when you are hungry and do n't take babies or small children with you . You are more susceptible to impulse-buying when you are hungry and , therefore , more likely to stray from your wellplanned list . As for the other " do n't , " babies and young children simply slow you down , and it is n't all that enjoyable or rewarding an experience for most of them anyway . Older children , however , can learn a great deal about food , and how to choose it wisely , and they can also be a big help in rounding up odd items from far corners of the store . Beyond that , it is a grand time just to be together with them . Marketing can be a kind of basic experience , especially when you are going for the week 's supplies , I f you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ? the butcher 's , the baker 's , the grocer 's ? you have  | even more of an adventure to share with your children . Supermarkets may give some women the shakes , but if you are tuned in to them , they can provide exhilarating and festive shopping experiences for both you and the children ? a vestige of provisioning in pioneer days for those with a romantic heart and generous imagination . To remain romantic and generous in this adventure , however , requires a few ground rules . In addition to not taking young children with you , do not take hungry children or greedy children either . The hungry ones can be eliminated by giving them a snack ahead of time ; the greedy ones need definite restrictions set so they are not loading up your basket with items not on your list . Make a flat rule of " No items not on the list , " or allow one item he selects and pays for himself or one item at a certain price limit that you treat him to ? whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an educational plus if you have a clear understanding with your children on what they may and may not select for either financial or nutritional reasons , or for the sheer exercise in resisting the siren song of Madison Avenue as it touts the new Scrunchies on afternoon TV . As for supermarkets , do not shop from one to another . It is a foolish waste of time to buy some things at one supermarket and others at another in an effort to save money . The mere thought of waiting in more than one checkout line should be enough to discourage the whole idea . But more important , the belief that you can save money by buying some items at one supermarket , and other items at another , is simply not true . It saves little if any money over the long run . Supermarkets are competitive . If you want to take advantage of the specials they run , check the newspaper ads for specials at the store you regularly shop , and then select the menu cards that take advantage of those specials . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop-  | ping around . Stay with a store you like , and adjust your menus to take advantage of their specials . Many working mothers find it useful to make an acquaintance with a small market that offers delivery service . The prices might be too hard on the pocketbook for routine shopping , but when you are stuck with more to do than time to do it in or you are caught in an emergency , you may be more than happy to pay for the service of having your grocery order taken by phone , filled and delivered to your door . The trick is to handle this service wisely . Do n't fall into the trap of indulging your " Just do n't feel like marketing " moods when you ca n't afford it . A runaway " Charge it " habit can trip you up , too . But do n't overlook the possibilities such markets have for helping you out when necessary . They are available not only in the large cities but in suburbs and small towns , too . Check the yellow pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is close enough to be of use to you . When you return home from the store , take the time now to get each item , particularly the meat , as nearly ready for cooking or serving as you can before it is put away . If you are new to the menu game or are not yet thoroughly familiar with your recipes , check back over your cards and schedule to see what 's what . If you have ground beef for patties , you obviously can form them before putting them away into the refrigerator or freezer . If part of the roast is to be used for pepper steak , slice it now if you have not had the butcher do it . Most fresh fruits and vegetables should be washed and thoroughly dried before being put in the refrigerator . ( Children have a hard enough time remembering to wash their hands and faces , much less the fresh food they eat , so have it washed and ready for them . ) Some notable exceptions are berries and mushrooms which will not long survive after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables in your menus , and yet want to do all or most of your weekly grocery shopping in one trip ( and this can save a lot of time ) , arrange your menu cards so that the fresh produce is featured during the first part of the week . For example , if you are shopping on Saturday , your menu plan might call for fresh fruit salad on Sunday , the next day , rather than the following Friday , a week away . That 's when a salad such as pickled beet and hard-cooked egg would work out fine . It is difficult to keep fresh fruits and vegetables from growing limp and tired in the refrigerator for more than a few days . If you have a reasonably good-sized refrigerator and freezer for the size of your family there is no reason why you can not plan menus for the week , and take care of all or at least most of the grocery shopping in one weekly trip . In some places , milk is one of the few things still delivered to your door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth an extra few cents to eliminate the extra trip to the grocery store . Milk machines serve the same purpose in large apartment buildings . Whatever else needs to be done ? from putting butter into its cover dish to making lunch-box sandwiches for the freezer ? to prepare you and the kitchen for the week ahead , the best time to get this head start is when you are putting the groceries away after the major shopping expedition of the week . If the children take their lunches to school , they can help prepare them now . lt 's a convenient time with most of the fixings just purchased . Let your child make the sandwiches he wants for the week , wrap each one well , and store them together in a special box or freezer container so that the sandwiches will be easy to find when you want them . During early morning rush hour the sandwich for the day can be taken from the freezer , popped into  | lunchbox or bag , and it will be thawed and ready for eating by lunchtime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened butter or margarine , not mayonnaise , salad dressing or jelly , or the bread may be soggy after thawing . Do not freeze lettuce and tomatoes ; add them to sandwiches after they are taken from the freezer . ) Doubling up on recipes is also a good way to save time later on . Once you have the equipment and ingredients assembled , it takes little more effort or time to cook eight portions of a stew , for example , than four . You wind up with one dish for now and one for the freezer . When you do , note on your menu cards that you have an extra lasagna , or whatever it is , stowed away in the freezer . Also , jot down the date on the card so that on a not-too-distant menu-making day , you will remember to rotate it out of the freezer ( and also mark it off the menu card ) , if an emergency quick meal has n't already claimed it . Each week , as you look through your menu cards , check to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be using up and if so , work them into the coming week 's menus . Prepared frozen dishes ought to be used within a month if you want to enjoy them at top flavor . Noting down the date on the menu card when you put the dish into the freezer is a good way to keep track of what you have on hand ; it is a crime against time to allow a meal to languish in the freezer until you happen upon it as some strange , unidentified object during a once-everysix-months ' inspection tour through your freezer . Unless you have more free time than most working mothers , you will never have so many dishes prepared ahead that you will have any problem using them ; the problem is in keeping track of them and remembering to use them . A notation on your menu card each time you put in or take out a dish is a big help in keeping you up-to-date on your frozen as-  | sets , and it is easy to make these notations when you are menu-making for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncooked , and cooked meats are much better in a sauce or gravy than frozen plain . Cooked turkey , for example , freezes better in a sauce or gravy than plain sliced turkey , which is apt to become too dry if left in the freezer for more than just a few days . The flavor of some dishes , such as boeuf bourguignon and coq au vin , are actually enhanced when the ingredients have time to blend . Sauces used for spaghetti and many other pasta dishes are usually better when frozen separately and the pasta cooked later while you are reheating the sauce . Rice and potatoes do n't fare too well in the home freezer , either ; they tend to go mushy and taste warmed over . Make certain not to overcook any dish intended for the freezer . When you are double cooking , remove the portion to be frozen while it is still a bit underdone . Most double cooking is obviously not to be started when you arrive home from work on a week-night , but a weekend cooking session can produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezer for some busy week-night coming up . For the return they give in two or three excellent meals tucked away in the freezer , the time spent on Saturday making boeuf bourguignon or coq au vin is time well spent . You need not choose a recipe that demands the ultimate effort to turn out a decent version of these dishes either . You need not make your own chicken stock from a chicken you have personally selected from an exclusive chicken farm in a neighboring town when a can of chicken stock or a bouillon cube will work out fine for a working mother willing to sacrifice a few of the finer points of cooking to the finer needs of family life . Many " complicated " dishes can be prepared in steps so  | that all kinds of other kitchen chores can be sandwiched in between ; and once you have the bourguignon in the oven to simmer slowly for two or three hours , the rest of Saturday 's thoughts about dinner have been taken care of , as well as the main course for another dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three or four members , it makes sense to have a few specially large cooking utensils for double cooking , since using two or three pans to take care of a double or triple recipe , measuring separately into each and cleaning up afterward scarcely saves time . A large kettle for making quantity spaghetti sauce and soup is worth owning ; so is a large double electric fry-pan-roaster , which can be attractive enough for use when entertaining as well as for double-up cooking . Your recipes should be appropriate too ; some recipes just do not turn out well when doubled or tripled , and almost all have to be adjusted for seasoning . Other items that are essential if you own a good-sized freezer ? and pity the working mother who does n't ? are an adequate number of good , substantial , air-tight freezer containers in sizes suited to your family 's meals . You can save freezer space and time with some dishes ? chiefly casseroles ? by baking them in containers lined with heavy , freezerduty foil , freezing , then sliding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the freezer . ( If you take the time to prepare a good dinner , then take the time to wrap and store it properly . ) When the food is taken from the freezer for dinner , the foil can be removed easily and the food slipped back into the container , ready for the oven . Choose a couple of identical casseroles for this purpose ? preferably of the type that will go from freezer to oven to table . Inexpensive ones can be found , and it is well worth having two .  | Once you take on an outside job , it is absolutely vital that you remain , or become , enthusiastic about the planning , cooking and serving of food at home or you will wind up doling out tired meals to a family tired of them . If you are not already a good basic cook you should become one ; it is much more important to know how to cook when you have a limited amount of time than when you have a lot . When you have a job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for blindly groping your way through a recipe to an uncertain ending . Good cooking need not take more time than bad cooking ; in fact , it takes less . It can be the soul of simplicity and satisfaction , quick and easy to do if you know your ingredients and how to handle them , if your preparation is deft , and your sense of seasoning sure . Time spent in mastering the art of cooking is one of the wisest investments a working mother can make . It can save not only time and money but can provide much family enjoyment . Good cooking satisfies more than your family 's hunger for food just as the home you have created for them serves as more than a roof over their heads .  | QUICK , HELP ME LOOK FOR THE BUTTON BOX ! Twenty minutes before she must leave for school , your daughter discovers a button is missing from her blouse . The one that goes with her blue skirt that she has to wear " because they 're having assembly today and everybody 's wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button . " Good grief . Another day starts with a panic . Why did n't she get her clothes out the night before ? " I did . I did n't know the button was missing . " She 's right . You 've got a link missing in your laundry chain . With the whole laundry job so much easier today than it was just a few years ago , there is little reason for not having a smooth , systematic method of dealing with it . New equipment and new products have made the drudgery and long hours spent in doing laundry a thing of the past , but nothing has been invented to date that will sort the clothes for you , put them into the machine , take them out again and put them away in good repair , including replacement  | of missing buttons . The essential part of laundry work today is organizing so that you follow through on what the machines and other products deliver . One immutable laundry law says that nothing is put away from the laundry unless it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced , and rips , loose seams and drooping hems will be repaired ; nothing gets put away if it is not in top wearing condition . Unsuspected repair work can be discovered if you check each item before it goes into the washing machine . Clothes that need any repair at all should be shunted out of the laundry line . Major repairs should be done before the item is washed , or it may be in worse shape by the time it comes through the machine . Check the clothes again as they come from the dryer . Put aside any that may have lost a button or that may need other repairs not noticed earlier . Mending , if it can not be done at laundry time ? and it might not be the best time to do it or it might not even be possible to do it then ? should be kept in a particular place until you do have time for it . Whether in the laundry room , a closet or a drawer , keep the items to be mended in a specific place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can mean a mere matter of hours or of days , depending upon the demand for the garment as well as your schedule and how you fit your mending in . The minor lap-work variety of repairs fits in so well with the quiet part of family activities ? conversation , reviewing homework , TV watching ? that many women reserve such sewing for these times and consequently keep most of the minor mending up to date . Regardless of how you schedule your mending , you , or whoever else is responsible for it , will know what and how much has to be done if it is kept in a particular place . In addition , clothing that is " out-of-service " will not be counted on for wearing  | by some unsuspecting family member ; your husband and children will not be left to discover at the last minute that they can not wear what they had planned . As for the missing button on your daughter 's blouse , such repairs could well become her own responsibility as soon as she is capable of handling them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dresser drawer or a special place in her closet . ( Make similar arrangements for any other family members who can take over care of their own clothing . ) If your daughter knows that the blouse she wants to wear the next day is in her mending drawer , she can replace the missing button or make whatever repairs are needed the night before . ( A new fail-safe device for replacing missing buttons that slip past your guard , or that sabotage you by coming off at the last minute , is the Panic Button ? a small stick pin with a shirt button for a top that fits onto the garment in tie-tack fashion . ) Many women own the latest in laundry equipment , buy clothing with easy-care finishes , and try every new laundry soap or detergent , and do not use any of them to full advantage . They buy durable- or permanent-press shirts and dresses for their children and when they take such clothing from the dryer they stuff it into a laundry basket , thereby creating a whole basketful of needless ironing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not bother with the presoak period which is essential to remove the spots and stains for which they bought the product to begin with . They have washers and dryers that do excellent jobs on a reasonable amount of clothes at any one time , and after they load the appliances , they cram in five or six extra pieces , thus ensuring less than full performance from the machines . In short , they waste a great deal of time and money by not knowing or by ignoring the  | proper use of the products that have been developed for today 's laundry job . For example , the clothes and linens you own and the way you handle them can determine to a large extent how carefree and timesaving your laundry job is . You will hear lots of advice about saving the hang-tags from the garments you buy so that you can refer to them at laundry time for special instructions . This is bad advice , or at least misleading advice , for working mothers , for it assumes that you will be buying clothes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do the household laundry , and like almost all working mothers , you may check the tag the first time the garment comes up for washing , but by the second time around either the tag will have long since been lost in the shuffle or you will be in a hurry . You decide to risk the garment 's survival in the regular wash . Sometimes it makes it , sometimes it does n't . Which is why tags that carry special directions for laundering should be viewed by the working mother as warning signs for the clothes she ought not to buy . Rather than saving such tags , do n't collect them to begin with . Trying to keep track of and doing your laundry by special directions with different garments can be a real killer . By the time you sort your laundry you may have five or six piles , with three or four items each , and another two or three pieces to do separately . Working mothers have no time for this kind of nonsense . A number one rule for your laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it does n't ( this includes lingerie , baby wear and other so-called delicates ) . If it does n't survive , you never make the mistake of buying that brand or type of fabric again . Do n't have anything so delicate in regular use that it ca n't go through the regular laundry . If you are going to get the most from machine  | laundry , make your washing all machine-washable and machine-dryable . Where is the saving in time if you wind up with machine washing and hand or special-care laundry , too ? Of all the technological advances in the home in the last twenty years , probably none has more regular timesaving built into it so inexpensively as the durable-press finishes for clothes , sheets , tablecloths , bedspreads , curtains , draperies and slipcovers . All can come from your dryer wrinklefree with no need for ironing , if you treat them right . Forgoing hand-washables or other " washable " items that require special machine settings and care is no real sacrifice . There are beautiful choices in cottons , cotton blends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ready to wear . Durable-press garments can be as delicatelooking as the hand-washable delicates or as sturdy as the rugged fabrics used for boys ' play trousers ? and neither will need ironing . Forget about the blouse for yourself that I must be washed separately and needs ironing or the dress with the tag that says " Do not spin-dry " or " Wash by hand in warm water with mild soap . " Forget these and any other " washable " items ? no matter how " darling , " no matter what a good buy " they are ? unless they meet your test for washing , which means they ought to be completely machine-washable and machine-dryable , and require no ironing . If you follow this buying pattern , your laundry then need be sorted only for color : dark , white and light colors . You might not now own a completely durable-press wardrobe and linen supply , but you can work your way toward them with little extra expense . As you buy replacements for clothes and linens , buy only durable press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable press and nearly work-free . The one good thing about children  | growing out of their clothes so rapidly is that they can have replacements that are durable press . When buying durable press do not confuse it with earlier easy-care finishes such as " drip-dry " and " wash and wear . " Do not confuse it with tags which read " little or no ironing . " ( Your idea of a " little " ironing and the shirtmaker 's can differ considerably . ) Durable press literally needs no ironing . The finish is usually applied to the garment after it is made . The material absorbs the finish through a heating and pressing treatment that locks in the pleats and creases and locks out the wrinkles . The garment then has a memory , which means that when it is washed and dried properly , it returns to its original shape ? sharply pressed , creases in , wrinkles out . One disadvantage , though minor , is that once the creases are in , they are in to stay . If you let down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemline can not be ironed out ; so be careful to choose clothes that fit properly . Also , look to see if there is excessive puckering along the seams and at the pockets ; if there is , it will not wash out or iron out . The original seams as well as the hemlines are set and wo n't iron away if the garment is let out ? another reason for making sure you get a correct fit to begin with . ( Improved finishes to eliminate these problems are now being tested so that even better durable-press products can be expected as these new developments reach the market . ) The durable-press process is applied to a variety of fibers , including blends of cotton and polyester , cotton and nylon , and all cotton . One of the best combinations for dresses and blouses is a blend of 65 percent polyester ( some trade names are Dacron , Fortrel , Kodel ) and 35 percent cotton . This is also a popular combination in boys ' and men 's shirts ; so is a 50-50 combination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the long-wearing strength and easy-maintenance qualities of the synthetic .  | Such clothes are excellent long-term values in looks , performance and minimum care . Sheets and pillowcases of durable press can be of either percale or muslin cotton combined with a synthetic . A good combination blend here is one of 50 percent polyester fiber and 50 percent cotton . The new blends for sheets are a great improvement over the first wrinkle-resistant sheets put on the market . They may cost you more , but you can get along with fewer , because they can be washed and put back on the bed in a matter of only an hour or so if need be . But the real saving is in the time ? hours of time that used to be spent in ironing . Do not automatically assume , however , that all durable press is the same or that your clothing and linen purchases will perform equally well . There are various grades of quality in fabrics , finish and construction . You can learn a great deal by comparing items in the store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of all , use your own experience in buying . Observe the wearing qualities , such as color fastness , shrink-and-wrinkle resistance , durability , and the comfort of various fibers , fabrics and brands . Pass on what you learn to others in ' the family so that they will know what to look for in good clothing construction and wearability . Durable press was made to be machine-washed and machine-dried , and the appliances sold today provide the proper settings for them . They need a cold rinse and a slow spin in the washing machine , and a cool-down period at the end of the drying cycle . If your machines do not automatically provide these requirements , you can adjust most of the settings yourself . Wash in cool or warm water for the least wrinkling and turn off the hot water faucet for the cold-water rinse if you have to . If your dryer does not cool down after drying for the final tumble , turn the dryer to  | No-Heat for a short time and then take the clothes out immediately . The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be cold and that the clothes should be removed from the dryer at once and folded or hung on hangers . If you do not have a dryer , take the clothes out of the washer before the last spin cycle and hang them , smoothing out collars , cuffs and seams with your fingers . Give the flat pieces a good hard shake and hang and smooth them on the line . Because durable press stays fresh-looking longer after it is washed than other fabrics , you might be tempted to postpone laundering some items . Do n't . If the clothes get too soiled , the dirt can penetrate the finish and is then difficult to remove . In buying sheets and pillowcases , select a different color or pattern for each bedroom . For linens already on hand , you can color-key them with iron-on mending tape or magic marker . Stack the linens on shelves marked with the same color to save time otherwise wasted in looking through the sheets for the ones that fit a particular bed . Towels of a different color or pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up after themselves . Color-coded towels also make it easier for you to put the finger on the culprit who left his towel lying on the floor . If you own , or have easily available , a washer and dryer , it is wasteful of time and space as well as money to have too many clothes and linens . By the time your children are likely to disagree seriously about how much is too much , they should be well able to select and care for most of their own wardrobes , and at that point it becomes a matter of family finances and personal choice as to how much clothing you provide for them . Working mothers sometimes think that when they start  | to work the first thing to do is to buy extras of underwear , socks and so on . Actually , extras in clothing can add to your difficulties in keeping track of needs , using up space , inviting clutter , and encouraging you to put off doing the laundry regularly and frequently . Suit the number of items you acquire ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frequency with which you need to do the laundry , not to how long such items will enable you to ignore or postpone the job . Do n't let laundry ? either washing or ironing ? pile up . It is wasteful and demoralizing , when you can save money and maintain a better disposition by tucking in several laundry periods through the week , depending on family size . If you have your own laundry equipment , organize it . Keep all the necessary laundry aids close by , including measuring cups and stain-removal aids . Use the measuring cups for the recommended amounts of soap , detergents and bleach . The directions for using these products have been carefully worked out by the manufacturers to give you the best performance . Keep a spot-removal guide handy , too , to tell you how to deal with stains . You will be more likely to treat stains quickly ? and properly ? if the how-to-do-it information is close at hand . If you can only vaguely recall having a bulletin on the subject somewhere and a five-minute search does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the rest of the laundry while you hope for the best . Which usually is in vain . So keep the laundry information you need where it can be found . If you must go outside or to the apartment house basement to do the laundry in coin machines , have a cart or caddy to organize your laundry supplies . Add a special jar to keep change for the machines ; this can also be used to collect the family 's extra change  | each night ( encourage your husband to play this game ) to provide coins for milk machines , school lunches , and carfare . The laundry job ? the washing and drying , folding and hanging ? ought to be planned as one continuous operation so that clothes are not jumbled up in the machines where the wrinkles set in them , or stuffed in laundry baskets where the same thing happens , only more so . Laundry is one place in housekeeping where certain definite rules can apply . Some of the do 's and don'ts for any person 's washday include : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machines do a less efficient job than they are capable of , and it causes wrinkling . Sort clothes . Sort dark from light loads for both washer and dryer . Never give in to the temptation to toss a leftover dark piece or two into a white wash to fill out the load . Do n't wash or dry heavy lint-producing articles ( chenille bedspreads , shag rugs ) with other items . Always check pockets . Girls keep tissues and lipsticks tucked in them , boys carry chewing gum . These and other assorted goodies found in children 's pockets , as well as the ball-point pens in husbands ' shirts , are real troublemakers . Give each item a good shake before it goes into the machine . This can cut down on lint as well as give the clothes a better workout in the washer . When the machines have finished their cycles , take the clothes out immediately . Always be on hand when the wash cycle finishes , and the dry cycle , too . Get a separate timer to set if your machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold or hang with far fewer wrinkles ( none with durable press ) if you take them from the machines and  | hang or fold them at once . Have hangers ready so there is no delay in hanging the shirts , blouses and dresses . This practice alone can save you hours of ironing . Resist the temptation to put a load of clothes into the washing machine or dryer , and then go off to work . You need to be around when your appliances are operating to detect any strange sounds or smells from the equipment that may warn of coming trouble . All kinds of things could happen while you are away that would make you regret leaving a machine untended while it is in operation . A stopped-up drain may surprise you with a flooded floor upon your return . A dryer may slip past its " off " switch and keep right on tumbling and drying all day . ( If you are making best use of the dryer , you will be there the instant the clothes finish to get them out and folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a device that will refluff the clothes if you do n't take them out the first time the buzzer rings . ) The smell of rubber burning or the acrid odor of a motor in trouble needs you around to pull out the plug promptly . An unbalanced load in the washing machine can thump the daylights out of the clothes before it trips the switch to stop the machine . You will need to be there to redistribute the load and start the machine again . Until you reach that great no-iron day when your family and household have a wardrobe and linens that are completely durable press and a dryer in which to iron it , hand irons will still be a necessary part of the laundry routine . Some ironing hints may help with this job that so many women hate : Remove from the line or dryer , while they are still damp , the clothes you would ordinarily sprinkle ? if you are going to iron them shortly . Smooth out each item , roll tightly and wrap in a clean cloth or put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fold all other laundry items carefully before  | you start ironing . Even if your clothes are not durable press , stuffing them into a laundry basket only adds to the job of ironing . Take the time to fold each piece . Sort into groups the clothes that should be ironed at the same temperature . You may wind up with several separate piles of ironing , which is another reason to work toward a monolithic durable-press wardrobe . Do n't bear down on the iron . Heat is supposed to do the work , not pressure , and it only tires you more . The best way to iron a garment is to start with the smallest part and work to the larger , e.g. , on a shirt do the cuffs first , then the collar , yoke , sleeves , two fronts and back . For double fabric , such as the collar and yoke , iron first on the wrong side , then on the right . Iron dark fabrics on the wrong side to prevent a shine . If you do not own your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your apartment house or close by , sending the laundry out is the next best answer as far as timesaving goes . Or , if you do not yet have most of your washable clothes and linens of durable press , obviously you can save a great deal of time by sending them to the laundry . But it is also expensive , and your clothes and linens can take a real beating ? which means more expense because they will wear out faster . It would probably be worthwhile to take your washing back and forth to an automatic laundry if you can fill the time while the clothes are in the machines with something besides boredom ? whether it is something useful or interesting or both . Attendants stationed at the better automatic laundries will , for a reasonable charge , fold and hang your clothes when they finish the dry cycle . By all means buy this service if you can not be there when the clothes are finished .  | IF I ONLY HAD MORE TIME The only way you can &et; it is to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v ? ' v got . While time is a valuable possession for anvo ney for the working mother it ranks second only to air for actual surviva our airy supply has an absolute limit of twenty-four hours , and the first thing you will have to do is to get the demands on it equal to the supply . By making up your schedules of daily and weekly work and activities , you will be able to see , probably for the first time , exactly where your time goes . Be sure to account for the activities beyond the usual housework ? the escorting or chauffeuring of children here and there , meetings , classes , social gatherings and other time-takers . You may well be surprised , and appalled , at the number of activities you are involved in , one way or another . Without knowing exactly when it happens , you can drift into a pattern of life where the demands upon your time get completely out of hand . As the family grows and interests  | widen , more activities are added until a full-fledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities now compete for your child 's time and interests , from lessons in baton twirling to yoga , from charm school to athletic clubs . Every sort of sport is organized for both boys and girls . More and more schools , churches and other community organizations are increasing their extra-hour programs for young people . For many working mothers , these are welcome activities , indeed , in that they provide planned and supervised activities for children who may have few other interesting or worthwhile alternatives for after-school hours . Shock waves are felt in other homes , however , because of the increasing demands upon the parents ' time for help with organizational matters and , at least in the suburbs , with the chauffeuring of youngsters to and fro . It would be easy indeed for the children to fill up all of their time with organized activities and to take all of your spare time in carting them to and fro . City mothers could spend a good part of their time worrying about whether their children had arrived safely at their various destinations . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have little influence on the determination of their children 's outside interests . If Little League hall is played by most of the boys in your son 's third grade , you need hardly be surprised if he wants to play , too , even though you may disagree with the value of this organized sport . The activities that engage your child 's time , however , should be determined by the values you wish him to have and your own time and finances , as well as by his own interests and desires . F " In narrowing the choices , a good place to begin might be ' with those activities you wish to see your child take up but in which he clearly wants no part . Working mothers  | can be tempted sometimes to use the " extra money " they make for more " opportunities " for their children . These may take the form of lessons and practice sessions stretching far beyond the interests or capabilities of the child . Or they may be activities that you think are therapeutic : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete , " when he would rather be reading or building a model airplane ; or " She 's so clumsy ? ballet lessons would help , " when she would rather be playing ball . Other activities that need to be sorted out are those where the parents ' interests or attitudes may not be fair measures of what the child wants or needs . A parent who thinks Little League is outrageously overorganized and refuses to let his child participate may be overdoing it for the youngster who simply enjoys baseball and wants to play with his friends . Another parent may ruin his son 's enjoyment of Boy 's Club football because he sees it mainly as a head start to high school and college football . From the children 's side will come claims that " everybody 's joining . " And pleas : " I 'd rather learn horseback riding than anything in the world " ; " Please let me take drums , I promise I 'll practice . " Hidden in the passing fancies , pipe dreams , and grandiose plans may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the magic motivator , or just the sheer fun that makes childhood worth it all . You have to help your children sort out all these choices . Beyond the practical limits of your time and money , if you consider honestly what the activity means to the child and to you , you can better decide its true value . Think about the time spent in all these activities ? not only the children 's but also your own . Try to make these activities add up to something instead of spreading yourselves thin . By being careful here , you can see to it that the things that count are not crowded out by those that don't.  | As for your personal interests , you may well find that the opportunity which working gives you to see people throughout the day cuts down on the need or desire for a lot of outside social activities . It will come to you eventually that you would be far better off and happier , too , if you could just drop the bridge game with the girls on Tuesday nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but now you are always so rushed to get there and always so tired when you get home . Drop Tuesday-night bridge . What about family and community activities ? You are asked to be chairman of the hospitality committee for the Neighborhood Council . " Mother , I told my teacher maybe you could be a room mother . Will you , Mom , please ? " The Heart Association asks you to collect for them on your block , or in your apartment house . Hank wants to join the Boy 's Club basketball team : " Can you drive the car pool ? " A good thing to do on decisions like these is to analyze them first instead of responding immediately with an instinctive " No " or an intimidated " Yes . " Before you take on any activity , find out as precisely as you can what will be expected of you , and when . Then estimate as closely as you can how much of your time it will take . The Neighborhood Council meets once a month October to May ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman 's meeting once a month ( three hours on a Thursday night ) . In addition , you will be responsible for contacting your committee members and supervise hospitality arrangements for each monthly meeting . Being room mother involves helping with two class parties during the year ( two hours each in the afternoon for the party and two hours each to help prepare for it ? one at Christmas time , the other on Valentine 's Day ) . Plus  | two field trips ( two half days during the year , not scheduled yet ) . The Heart Fund collection ( one to two hours , including time out to chat with neighbors ) . Hank 's basketball car pool ( 15 minutes each way , Tuesday night , every week for basketball season ? 10 weeks ) . Now , what goes , what stays ? First , the Neighborhood Council . Although you are sympathetic to the aims of the Council if you are to be honest you know that the committee will take time you will begrudge giving . The meetings and arrangements and telephoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every four . Besides that , hospitality committees are not really where you think your time can count the most . You say " No " to the Neighborhood Council . Room mother stays . It is the last year Billy will care whether you are a room mother or not , and he wants very much to have you do it . You can save the leave from your job to take care of time off for the parties and field trips . You can do the Heart Association job on Saturday afternoon . Anne would like to come with you for the walk . The Boy 's Club car pool is on Tuesday night . You enjoy the conversation the boys carry on among themselves , and it 's a good way to keep up with what thirteen-year-olds are thinking about . You could do it if Anne puts the laundry through the washer and dryer while you 're out . Yes for the car pool . You have taken on activities , none of which you might have picked for your personal enjoyment , but all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family or another . You also now know that for the next few weeks there will be little else you will be able to take on if you are also to save some time for yourself and your  | husband ? for going out or for entertaining . You can , therefore , in friendly but firm fashion turn down any other requests for your time . If the Council or other volunteer work means a great deal to you , there might be other alternatives . If you can not manage the whole activity , perhaps a part of it would work , or perhaps another sort of activity . You can state frankly that you do not have time to do a good job with the hospitality committee . Perhaps you could work in something else . You know of a good speaker who is anxious to acquaint more people with the youth work going on in the city . Can you volunteer to handle all arrangements for one of the monthly programs during the year ? You might divide roommother responsibility with another mother , each taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the whole job but want to do part of it , ask . Volunteers are seldom turned down when they are volunteering , no matter how small a part of the job they may be able to do . After you have simplified your activities , you can start on your housework ? the day-to-day responsibilities that have to be crammed into each twenty-four hours . Much of life is like running in place . So many of the things you do advance you nowhere ; the cooking , cleaning , bed-making , dishwashing ? all to be done one day , all to he done again the next . Such jobs can be depressing , there 's no disputing that ; but there is also no getting around them unless you are very rich or very important , which most of us are not . The thing to do with the dailies is to learn the most efficient methods of disposing of them . The word " efficiency " has a nasty ring to it ; it became the subject of much derision when , some years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time and energy saving . With stop watches at the ready , the efficiency engineers strapped pedometers to the housewives ' ankles and  | stuffed breathing tubes in their mouths . They drew a lot of laughs with their studies , but they gained a great deal of useful information for homes as well as industry . Today , the working woman with more to do than time to do it in does not sneer at the word " efficiency " or anything else that will make her job easier . There is obviously no one set way for any household job that will work for everyone ? except the approach to the job : An observant eye and a receptive mind to make you aware of ways you are wasting time or not getting the most out of it . There are also some basic findings from worksimplification studies which can be applied to various jobs throughout the house . One fundamental rule is to store items near the place of first use to eliminate wasted steps and time . For example , you store towels in or near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can take this same idea of convenience and put it to work elsewhere in the house . Where do you use the vacuum cleaner ? In the kitchen ? No . Then why do you keep it in the broom closet ? Because that 's where you 're supposed to keep your cleaning supplies . The front closet , closer to living room and bedroom , is for coats . But most of the time , your family uses the back door ? it 's more convenient for them . Maybe you should work out a trade ? by rearranging shelves and poles you could keep family coats in the back closet , and the vacuum cleaner up front , where both would be more convenient for you . ( Do n't overlook closet shops in department stores for help with " instant " shelves and poles that you can put up yourself . ) The principle of storage at the point of first use can be applied to many kitchen utensils with good results and practically no expense . A good many architects and builders could have profited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-designed laundry facility is placed near bedrooms , baths , or dressing areas where most laundry accumulates instead of down in the basement where practically nobody goes to undress . Broom closets are another often misplaced storage space . The elimination of waste motions and steps is another form of work simplification . Making a bed all on one side before going to the opposite side rather than trips back and forth to put on bottom sheet , top sheet , blanket , pillows and spread is an example . Bed-making is a simple task , done daily by millions and millions of people . Yet relatively few of them make it as simple a task as it could be . Few children are taught the simplified way , which is a shame , for work simplification has perhaps its greatest appeal and most enthusiastic converts among the young . Another rule is to become motion-minded . Every so often as you go about your housework , if you have nothing better to think about , pay attention closely to the way you handle the dailies and see where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplification does not mean that you speed up your work by simply going faster . It means that you eliminate the steps or motions that waste time , much the way that you have indulged in life simplification to eliminate activities and demands upon your time . ( Of course , the most successful work simplification in terms of saving time , is to eliminate the job altogether . And for much " make-work , " or you " think-youought-to " type of work , this might well be the wise course . You do n't have to deep-clean the house from top to bottom every time you invite friends to dinner . For some women , " Company coming " can trigger an all-day , or all-night , or **29;221;TOOLONG cleaning response . Rugs rolled up , pictures off the wall , every nook and cranny cleaned and scrubbed and polished . They feel they " ought  | to . " No one in the family escapes being caught up , either in the work or the fallout from it . On the other hand , some women depend upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good housecleaning spree that they thoroughly enjoy . They feel they can coast for a while with once-over lightly dustings and vacuumings . The fact is , if you can provide spotlessly clean table settings , good food and congenial company , you can entertain . The depth of your cleaning should depend upon whether you and your family find it therapeutic and satisfying or exhausting and nerve-shattering . ( The latter is just not worth it . ) Well-organized work centers can provide duplicates of inexpensive materials and equipment when they are needed in more than one place . A dust mop for downstairs and one for up ; a vacuum for both if you can manage . Duplicate utensils in the kitchen ? measuring spoons at your mixing center and near the stove too ; the same for salt and pepper shakers . These and other duplicates are simple timesavers , but they make sense , and you will enjoy having them that way . Another term from work-simplification research is dovetailing . Here , you combine jobs so that the one added on eliminates some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast after doing the dinner dishes , you save putting away and getting out the dishes you will need next morning . Meal planning while cleaning the refrigerator is another example . In dovetailing , you are never doing one thing when you could be doing two . This is one of the most efficient sorts of timesavers a working mother can find . Effective organizing of jobs is another way to simplify work . The items you need to do a job , from cleaning the bath to mending clothes , are organized and stored where they are easy to see and easy to reach . Cumulating is engineer talk for doing several of the same  | jobs at one session . Double-up cooking ? preparing the dinner for now , another for the freezer ? makes preparation time for each dish far less than if each was done separately . Vacuuming all rooms while the vacuum is out , rather than a room at a time , saves getting the vacuum out more than once . One of the least expensive ways to save time but one that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find a store and sales person you like , concentrate your buying power there . One of the biggest time wasters a working mother can indulge in is to shop the sales trying to save money , not only when grocery shopping but for clothing and other items too . Sales are not always moneysaving , and they are almost never timesaving . Worse , by shopping one place one time and another place the next time , you are not getting the most out of your buying power . By concentrating all your shopping in one place , you will save time , get more service , and in the end at least as much for your money . For example , you know of a store for boys ' clothing that both you and your sons like . Still , you do n't go there all the time because occasionally one or two other stores have a special sale advertised . Even when you do go in , you do n't always have the same sales person help you each time . You are not concentrating your buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time take your children with you , ask to meet the department manager or a full ? time sales person . The world is not so big or the store so busy that they will not be happy to meet a new and regular customer . That is what you tell them : that you like their store , that you are going to be making all your purchases for your sons there , that you want the sales person to meet the children , measure them for sizes , and help with the selections . Since your time will be limited in shopping , you  | would like to become acquainted with the merchandise they carry ( presumably it suits your children and your pocketbook ) , so that some of your buying may be done by telephone . It is a good idea to make this get-acquainted trip when you will be buying more than a pair of socks or two . The fall , when you need new clothes for school , would be a good time since the children will probably be going into new sizes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to spend some time making selections and getting to know the store . It will then be far easier to shop by telephone for certain future items . Note down the measurements and sizes for all types of clothing . Some stores provide cards for this purpose and will give you a copy of the measurements and keep one for their files . The children know the items they prefer , and if it does n't offend your sensibilities or assault your purse , you can order by phone some of their clothing and supplies that do not have to be seen before buying ? socks or underwear , for example . Although you will not find as much personal service available in self-service and discount stores , you can still save time as well as money by settling on one store you like . You can learn the brands the store carries , settle on specific lines that are most satisfactory for your needs , know where the different departments are and the routines for paying and checking out , observe the hours when the store is least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easier and faster to make . As you become acquainted with the store 's operation , you may also learn their system for markdowns and the timing of their sales . Often , all you have to do to find out is to ask . Narrowing your choices will save an enormous amount of time . The notorious penchant of some women for want-  | ing to see every last thing that is available before making a decision can ruin more than one afternoon . If you are one of those poor souls who have a difficult time making decisions , you should seek out as many arbitrary means of narrowing your alternatives as you can . A good way to begin is by concentrating your buying power in one store for each category of shopping . Any sale of a lifetime that you may have missed elsewhere can be compensated for when you know a sales person who will call to let you know when his store 's stock is placed on sale . You can also keep in better touch with the clothes preferences of your children by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . A shirt you have picked up on sale is no bargain if it is last year 's tattersall and the child wants this year 's pin stripe . Maybe you thought it was such a good buy you could n't pass it up even though your boy did n't really need a shirt . But you have n't really saved anything if the youngster hates the shirt and wears it as little as possible . It helps save money and time , not to mention anxiety , to know the clothes preferences of your children . You may not indulge all of their likes , but you also will not be wasting time and money buying something they wo n't wear , at least not willingly . Certainly , not every whim of fashion need be catered to ; on the other hand , there are other things to deny them if the denying is intended merely to stiffen character or rally individuality . A sense of belonging is important to children ? almost vital at certain stages ? and there are few less expensive or harmless ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt or pair of shoes that look exactly like everybody else 's shirt or shoes . The grocery store is another place where concentrated buying power can save you time . If you decide on one store one week , another the next , and a third another time .  | you are missing the opportunity of knowing the butcher , the manager , the fresh-fruit and vegetable man . These people should be friends of yours . If you shop one store regularly , the butcher knows how you like your roasts rolled , will bone the chicken , and even have your order ready if you let him know in advance . You also know where everything is in the store , and your trip through can be speedy , efficient and friendly . In a world where every store is crowded and everybody in a hurry , including you , it even helps counteract some of the antlike feeling if you can make your shopping a friendly experience , even though you are rushing through it too . Other friends who can help you save time are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hairdresser . Wherever you receive satisfactory service in your shopping , find out the person 's name so that you may ask for him the next time . When and where it is safe to send children on errands ? to the grocery for pick-up items during the week , to the dry cleaners , to the barber shop ? help him establish an acquaintanceship with the proprietors . Not only will your child be known and welcomed but it will help give him a sense of " neighborhood . " If your child prefers to wait for a certain barber in the shop , even though it often requires a good bit of extra time , let him wait . In a way , he is concentrating his buying power , too , and also gaining experience and confidence in dealing with people . There are , of course , ways to buy time as well as to save it . Besides the obvious method of obtaining regular household help , which often can not be found , much less hired , you can buy a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment you can afford . Chosen carefully and used properly , major appliances can pay handsome dividends in time saving .  | Certainly the first money you can possibly spare from your earnings should be earmarked for appliances that will make housework easier and faster for you . If you are in temporary quarters , investigate the possibilities of renting appliances . If you live in an apartment , see about making arrangements with your landlord that will allow you to install any additional appliances you need and still be able to take them with you if you move . Compact models of appliances now on the market offer a wide range of sizes to fit nearly any condition or space . If automatic laundry facilities are not easily available to you , an automatic washer and dryer ought to receive top priority . Combined with no-iron , durable-press fabrics , these appliances can free more time weekly than any other mechanical aid . Next on the list for some women would be a freezer , or a refrigerator-freezer combination , for the time they can save in fewer trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-cube compartment of a conventional refrigerator is too small and is limited to storage of frozen foods for only a few days at most because it can not hold a zero-degree temperature satisfactorily . ) A dishwasher for the woman who really hates doing dishes is almost the grandest invention of all . Not only does the automatic dishwasher do its main job well but it is also a wonderful repository for dishes until you have a load ready to wash ? and you wo n't have the couple of glasses , coffee cups , a plate or two that give a kitchen that messedup look . Working mothers who can enforce their own childlabor laws might not consider a dishwasher so essential . Dishwashing and garbage toting , while not necessarily character building , can be looked upon as a version of the wood-hauling , chicken-feeding chores of earlier family life . When you do buy new appliances , be sure to shop for  | more than the appliance . Select a reliable store that can also provide installation and service . An appliance bought from a store close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special advertised elsewhere , may help get you service when you need it . Unfortunately , you are likely to need it , and it is worth extra money if necessary to concentrate your buying power with appliances , too . The serviceman is one of those very important people in your life . The better part of many a day can be wrecked waiting for a serviceman who never shows up . About the best you can do in a time of vanishing services is to better your odds by buying at a first-class store that at least tries to maintain first-class service . Good service for household appliances has become a near-universal gripe , but the complaints are mostly from people who shop around for the best bargain on the appliance and give little thought to the repair work that inevitably goes with any mechanical contraption . It is worth extra money to know that when your washing machine begins that low moan that will end in a gasping jerk and a tub left full of water , you can call for a repairman and have a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant date . In selecting any appliance , buy only the conveniences you need . Every extra working gadget on an appliance increases the possibilities of things going wrong ? often , it seems , in geometric progression . Each appliance has certain basic functions for saving time and labor . Beyond these , think carefully about each additional feature to decide whether it will be of value to you . The top-of-theline model may differ from the model in the middle or even the bottom line only in the number of extra , but minor , features plus a little trim here or there . Such features may or may not save time , but they also add to the cost of the  | equipment and make it possible for more things to break down . On the other hand , the new major improvements in the capability of an appliance are often introduced as added features on a top-of-the-line model . A freezer , the basic function of which is to keep food frozen , may also offer nonfrosting equipment that will save hours of cleaning time year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about on the level of oven-cleaning as a fun thing to do around the house . In terms of purchase and operating costs spread over the years you will own the appliance you may be paying a relatively small amount yearly to eliminate a thoroughly disliked and time-consuming job . So nonfrosting refrigerators or self-cleaning ovens would rank high on any working mother 's list of priorities as appliances with essential added features . Even an automatic detergent and bleach dispenser can be a valuable convenience in saving trips back to the washer when it is running ? especially when so many builders in this country have ignored housekeeping problems for years , and to this day many of them still go right on putting the laundry room in out-of-the-way places . If your laundry equipment is more conveniently placed , the dispenser might be of little or no value to you . The main thing to remember is to concentrate on the appliances and features that will save you ? in your house with your family ? the most time for the money you have to spend . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond its reliability and its ability to perform its basic function , is the ease with which it can be maintained and cleaned . The easier it is to use , to keep and to clean , the more likely you are to take care of the appliance , thus helping provide a longer life for your investment .  | When you begin the use of an appliance , whether you have bought it or whether it comes with the rental of your apartment or house , be sure to take the time to find out how to use it properly . Then make certain that family members and others who will be using the appliance also know how to use it properly . Appliances , unhappily , go on the blink at what will seem a depressingly frequent rate , even without your helping them along with misuse or mistreatment . Cut down on the time wasted with appliances out-ofservice by treating them right . When an appliance breaks down , do not call the serviceman until you have checked to see whether the problem may be some minor trip-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sock out from behind the washer did you dislodge the electric cord just enough to interrupt the current ? Is there a fuse blown and you have n't noticed because you have n't been anywhere else in the house ? Are the control buttons correctly set and pushed in or turned all the way ? Is the door or lid closed securely ? A careful check first can save you time , money and a good deal of chagrin when a hastily summoned repairman does nothing more than reach down and nonchalantly push the electric plug back into the socket . A word about some of the lesser labor-savers , the kitchen gadgets , in particular . Think about them before you buy them . If they will not represent a real convenience , or you would not use them regularly , forget them . They take up valuable space , add to clutter , and do not pay their way in saving time . Sometimes they waste time . The mechanical hand chopper has not yet been invented that will do a more efficient job than a good sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accomplished cook . When finished , the knife is simply wiped and dropped into its holder . The chopper ( not to be confused with an electric  | blender , a wonderful invention ) must be taken apart , washed , dried , reassembled and stored away in the cupboard . A silly waste of time , yet millions of housewives buy them . Another way you can buy time is to pay for as many services as you can afford that now take your time ? from having milk and eggs delivered or buying milk from the machine in your apartment building to arranging for a once-a-month floor cleaning and waxing or spring and fall window-washing , if these jobs are always the last straw for you . There are many more services available than are commonly realized , and many women keep on doing jobs they can afford to pay someone else to do , simply because they have always done them or because they do n't know that the services are available . Many firms now specialize in home-cleaning services for either one-time jobs or on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone book under Janitor Service . When do-it-yourself projects , such as painting and paperhanging , get out of hand and are no longer as much fun and money saved as time lost and tempers shot , give them up or pay to have them done . You can not work all day , do housework evenings and weekends , and expect to set records as a do-it-yourselfer too . Let somebody else do it , or leave it undone . Forget about the great American do-ityourself mania except when it is part of your own or the family 's relaxation and enjoyment . The telephone can be one of the best devices for saving time or one of the most wasteful , depending upon how you use it . When you use the phone for recreation ? a friend calls you or you call them ? you can always combine the talk session with some job within arm 's reach . A long cord on the phone is a must , especially in the kitchen . You can widen your arm 's reach two ways and both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always things you can do around the kitchen while you are talking on the phone . You can work with a cleaning cloth ? the kitchen woodwork , the stove , and anything else within reach of your arm can be nearly always spotless . Cabinets can be straightened , dishes cleared , stacked , rinsed or even washed . Almost anything that needs to be done in the kitchen can be done while the phone is propped to your ear . Add a shoulder holder for the phone receiver if you like to engage in long gab sessions . Phone extensions can also extend your arm 's reach and save you time . If you have them , have long cords on them , too . The cost is negligible , and when the phone rings you can avoid many unnecessary interruptions and still enjoy the caller if you have a long cord on the phone so that you are not tied down to one spot . Use the phone as much as possible to save time on errands and shopping . Order by phone whenever you do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check availability of any item that you must go after before you go after it . Do n't go anywhere on an errand unless you check beforehand to be certain that the person or item that you want will be there . Call ahead . When you arrive , the service will be faster . The telephone , the yellow pages , the personal-shopper services of the stores can all save you time if you will put them to work for you . Saving time in anything is usually a matter of thinking ahead . This means that most of the time you 'll know not only what you 're doing now , but what you 're going to be doing next ? even if it 's nothing . When time is measured in terms of the intangibles , as well as in work accomplished and money earned , only you can measure its proper pace . You may speed up to dispose of the dailies and slow down to savor a moment of idleness ? both can enrich your life  | through time well spent . The time needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse ? only you can measure the value . In whatever ways you spend your time , it ought to pay high dividends in meeting physical needs and enriching the mind and spirit of each family member ? which is a very large order indeed .  | WHERE HAS OUR TOGETHERNESS GONE ? Are you looking in the right places and for the right things ? ( Togetherness is a state of mind as much as it is of being . How about first thing in the morning , when your husband is shaving , the children getting ready for school , and you lining up the various breakfast shifts ? It might be the last place you 'd think to look for togetherness , but it 's one of the most logical places to find it . The morning rush hour in a well-run working mother 's home can be a vital display of togetherness , with each member separately doing the tasks that contribute to an orderly house before leaving for the day . Even the youngest member who makes his bed each morning ? not because his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps the whole family unit ? is practicing togetherness . He is a working part of the " we " in family life . Many students of modern family life believe that one reason for its seeming disintegration is the lack of a common  | purpose , with parents believing that the past can be preserved and the young asserting that the future is now . Dad goes off one way , the kids another , and Mother is left behind wondering where everybody went . When a mother adds a job to her life , she can at least strengthen one practical common purpose in family life . Each family member can do more to keep the house functioning ; each member 's contribution can be recognized as important and essential to the whole family . This sort of functional togetherness helps keep a family from becoming just a collection of people living under one roof , each with his own interests , going off in all directions , with no pattern of life or common bond between them . Togetherness can be drawn not only from daily routines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of planning that makes a routine out of something that really is n't a routine ( so that the children wo n't know you have gone to all that trouble to arrange some togetherness in their lives ? if they , especially teenagers , suspected that what they were doing was togetherness , you can forget about togetherness ) . Dinnertime can figure large in planned routines and family tradition . It is often the only meal of the day that the whole family can share together . This once-simple and taken-for-granted activity is probably the most difficult part of the day for the working mother . Still , it probably should be the part she compromises on the least . Children cherish traditions . They draw security from them . Children say with pride : " We always hold hands for grace " ; " My father always carves the meat " ; " We always eat at seven . " Such small traditions tell children there are things in this world that are steady and unchanging and can be counted upon . But if the children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired ( he often is ) , and your  | nerves frazzled ( it can happen ) , it is a bit naive to expect that dinner will be much of an adventure in togetherness . One practical thing to do is to get these people out of your hair for a while before dinner . Give them something to gnaw on in place of you . It could be sliced fresh fruit , raw vegetables , a sour-cream dip , crackers and cheese ? not too much , but served with a bit of elan , perhaps by one of them . They can settle down with their nibbles while you put dinner together and onto the table . ( Most of your dinner is usually prepared the night before , the table set and even the predinner snack arranged . ) Some suggestions that are often put forth for saving time at dinner do little to make an occasion of the event . For example , paper plates and napkins and plastic cloths as timesavers may be well and good for picnics , but there is not much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular dinner hour . If linen tablecloths and napkins seem too much for every night ( and they can be ) , then give some thought to a good-looking but easy-care , semipermanent table covering . A top-quality , heavy , leather-look vinyl can make an elegant table covering . Smart black , trimmed with Spanish fringe , clear blue with a deep Colonial border ? infinite combinations can be made up by simply stitching trim to leather . It might seem expensive , but the cover will last and last and pays its way in time and laundry saved . It can be used as is or with table mats added from time to time to vary the place settings . Such a cover has the added virtue of becoming an attractive part of the room 's decor while protecting the table top and making a wonderful work surface ? always in place ? for study or small projects . It is impervious to just about everything but flame . The use of napkin rings is a sensible custom that helps make cloth napkins practical for everyday family use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any number  | of stain-repellent , durable-press fabrics . A fresh one for each member of the family two or three times a week is n't adding too much to the laundry as an alternative to paper napkins all the time . The dinner occasion itself can vary throughout the week , adding " always " traditions to the dinner tradition itself . You can use these variations to make a pleasant event for the family while helping you over a busy time . For example , if Friday nights are rushed for you , hectic with other planning and activities , that could be the night you " always " have a family-favorite menu ? the same every week ? one that has been mostly prepared ahead of time and easy to serve , for example , spaghetti , tossed salad , Italian bread , wine , cheese and fresh fruit . Perhaps the children are old enough to serve this dinner for you . Maybe Sunday dinner is " always " buffet and sit-whereyou-like for those who want to watch a favorite TV program together . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each young member washed and neat and in his own chair , ready with good conversation saved to share . Good conversation is not only an exercise in family living ; it is also important to the development of two-way communication . The child needs to develop an interest and confidence in his ability to talk with adults quite as much as the adult needs to be able to communicate with children . Obviously some people ? children as well as adults ? are more reserved than others and prefer to listen rather than talk . However , if they have learned the art of good listening , which carries with it some responsibility for sustaining a worthwhile conversation , they will be welcomed indeed wherever people gather to talk . Good family conversation does not necessarily " just happen . " While young children may be so flattered by an adult 's attentiveness that any topic addressed in terms they can  | understand will appeal to them , older children ? in the preteens and early teens in particular ? are more likely to tune out , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To entice such youngsters into conversation requires a more skillful and subtle introduction than " How was school today ? " or " Tonight we 'll talk about ... " Here are some things you can do to encourage family conversation : ollect topics to talk about . As you read the newspapers , listen to the radio or TV , and talk with people during the day , glean information or ideas for table topics . You may wish to establish a bulletin board or box to which all family members can contribute newspaper and magazine clippings dealing with any subject they like , from personal interests and anecdotes to matters of local , national and international interest . A wicker basket or pottery bowl used as a centerpiece for the family dining table can invite the children to deposit clippings from their own school papers and magazines to share with the family . 2Tf you fail to get any nibbles at first , do n't give up . You need n't plunge in each night , grimly determined to extract some satisfying response from the child . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how unimportant or pedestrian you think they might be . What about a TV program he thought was great ? Was there a newspaper review of it ? If the review is favorable , he can agree with it ; if unfavorable , disagree . In either case , he might add why he feels one way or the other , and you have a conversation . Consider the sports pages or fashion or entertainment news ? not to allow you to make bright , cheery , phony comments that betray your lack of real interest , but to ask a question you 'd genuinely like information on or to pass along an item he might have missed . If  | you strike out again , relax . A few night 's later you can move on to new music , Peter Max art , sports cars , science fiction . There is a whole subculture waiting to be sampled ( and only sampled ; see No. 8 ) by enterprising adults who are interested in enjoying conversations with their children . 3. resent topics for discussion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will interest your children if it is presented to them in an appetizing fashion . One effective method for involving each family member is to put a subject to a vote . For example : " If you could choose , would you spend money to go to Mars or to rebuild our cities ? " Any child old enough to talk is old enough to vote and will enjoy having the family franchise . They can not only vote but at an early age can give good reasons for their vote on a given subject . Another good way to provoke discussion is to present a subject as a problem that needs solution . You might ask : " Our air is becoming more and more polluted ; what in the world can be done about it ? " A small child might suggest that you shut the windows , another that you wear a mask ; older children will consider the causes of air pollution and suggest controls ; a long-range thinker might predict that man will adapt by evolving a set of lungs that will thrive on smog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with amusing , touching and idealistic answers , some remarkably informed opinions that reflect a sound grasp of the needs and ways of correcting the ills of society and our environment . Children of all ages are intensely interested in the betterment of a world with which they become familiar at so early an age . ' 4encourage communication between the generations , do not discuss communication between the generations . Accept the fact that your children 's views may be  | radically different from your own or from what you can remember as your own at their age . Your worlds may be radically different . You are , however , vitally interested in many of the same topics ? at least , you should be . While moral values and political issues may separate the generations by differences in point of view , it is the subject matter itself that provides room for discussion . If you can stick to the topic and not the communication gap , you will have communication . Many parents equate communication with agreement ; such is not always the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything fi them while you are doing the talking . If you shut up once in a while and practice listening , you may hear not only what happened during the child 's day , which can be of great interest and help to you , but you may also gain a better understanding of how and why your children form their views and nonviews . If you pose a question to them , hear out the answers they give . Let them finish their thoughts and sentences without interruption . Your purpose in conversation is as much , or more , to learn as to instruct . " I never thought of it that way " is infinitely preferable to - just are n't old enough to understand . " 6 , e genuinely interested in your children 's views . Your in Brest provides the climate where parent and child can learn most from each other . Their ability to discuss worldwide issues , if only questioningly , may astound you . War , poverty , violence and the other assorted ills of our society are as real to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , magazines and books that involve them at an ever-increasing early age in what previously have been considered adult concerns . You will not get from your children the banal talk of an ill-informed adult or the worthless reasoning of a closed mind . You will find , in addition to a  | surprising amount of knowledge , a refreshing inventiveness , compassion and concern plus nobility of purpose and simplicity in goals . 7rovide time for conversation . You can scarcely hope tork up a discussion , much less sustain it , if you or other family members must hurry through the meal and be off to an appointment in fifteen minutes . If it has become a rare evening at your house when the family can gather to eat and converse leisurely , then you should consider drastic surgery on outside activities . A good part of a dinner hour together depends upon how determined you are to fix time for it . Draw the children into your conversation rather than try to join them in theirs . Wait to be invited into their world , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as one of their peers . Obviously , you have to have some idea of what your child 's world is like if you are going to understand some of the problems in it , but do not try to live in his world or copy it . Although you may know the language of that world , or think you do , stick to your own native tongue . You can not bring off the next generation 's style , and your children would not want you to try . They would only be embarrassed by , or perhaps be scornful of , your efforts . 9 . Respect personal rights . The same regard for good mners and tact apply to conversations you have with your children as with any other person you respect . Consider how annoyed or offended you become if a relative or friend presumes in social conversation to pry into your personal affairs , give you advice you have not sought or make belittling or sarcastic remarks . Each family member , child as well as adult , has a right to the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to explain , defend or voice his opinion if he does not choose to . He is also entitled to have what he says held in confidence and not  | repeated by you . Parents sometimes succumb to the temptation to recount to anyone who will listen conversations that a child would prefer to have held in confidence . Whether the parent 's motive is to enhance his own status , to illustrate his problems or even to show off his child , it is not worth violating a child 's trust . There should be ground rules for dinnertime , too , but only a few ? maybe only two : No one comes late or leaves early without excuse , and no personal arguments or abuse is allowed . Children are not the only offenders on the latter score . The parent who uses dinnertime as an occasion for reviewing poor school performance can be certain that the child will have little desire to linger at the table for conversation . He will endure his meal and wait only for the chance to escape . The one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together should not be used for taking inventory of individual shortcomings . After-dinner times make good " together " times , too , so you might be making a mistake if you assign clean-up and dishwashing exclusively to the children . Such times provide excellent opportunities for conversation with children ? sometimes you 'll get gay and teasing banter and other times warm , intimate talks and quiet confidences . The latter seem to come easier when you are pushing pots and pans around in the soapy water and a daughter is wiping diligently away at a dish . The amount of leisure time when the whole family is together is often no less than if you were not working . For young children , leisure time together may require no more than your willing presence in order to be a success . Small children absorb and are eager for whatever time a parent can grant them . Older children , however , may not be all that keen for planned family fun and games or scheduled conversations with parents , or just hacking around the  | house . For these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members and probably further in advance , to make leisure time together most enjoyable . At the same time , you will find that building your family 's life-style into a daily routine is much more workable than waiting all year for a two-week vacation at which time you plan to devote your full attention to " togetherness . " It almost never turns out that way . What sometimes happens is that families not used to being together for long periods find themselves and their belongings squeezed together in a car for hours on end . Or they are stuck in a motel room or cottage on a rainy day . Or they have spent more than they figured on and the trip is only half over . For young children , travel is tiring , and strange surroundings and routines can be confusing ? and the reactions to both are quickly transferred to the parent . Older children are often dragged reluctantly along on family vacations when they would far rather be with their friends . And being teenagers , they are usually generous enough to share these views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the reasons why families may find a good part of their vacations exhausting , irritating and quarrelsome . Mini-trips are an alternative worth considering , regardless of the children 's ages . Instead of once-a-year , long vacations away from home , settle for a number of short trips that can be made on a weekend or even in a day . If you are suburbanites , you have reasonably easy access to outdoor sports facilities , parks , nature walks , quiet places . But you will also find that trips into the city for a late breakfast or for going to church , a museum or a concert , or for an afternoon of sightseeing , followed by dinner , can be both stimulating and relaxing . If you live in the city , explore it ? the whole family can benefit from knowing the  | culture it has to offer , the sociology it has to teach , the problems it has to solve . City families also need to get to the quiet places outside the city . Jaunts to the country , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suburbs are worth a one- or two-hour trip each way once in a while . Overnight trips to points of interest a short distance away are easy to manage since they do not require extensive logistical planning for wardrobes or the closing of the house , and can be refreshing and enjoyable for all . Such short trips also make it possible for older children to invite a friend along . You might not be able to endure the expense , or company , of an extra teenager for a week or so , but a day or overnight trip is not likely to strain either your cash or your cool . With mini-trips you can select any time of the year for vacation . Choice times are early spring and autumn , before and after the main tourist season . You 'll find that your time and money will go further , and the more leisurely pace is relaxing in itself . Since you can figure on a number of mini-trips for the same price as a long vacation , each member of the family has an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be as simple as an afternoon at the zoo for the youngest member or a tour of a museum for the art lover . All kinds of new hobbies , avocations and vocations await the family that explores their own part of the world in depth : an aspiring architect is born from visits to different cathedrals and churches on Sunday trips ; a history buff emerges from tours of Revolutionary and Civil War battlegrounds ; an adventurous cook develops from the sampling of national cuisines ; a lifelong nature lover awakens on hikes and overnight camp-outs at a nearby park ; a concerned environmentalist grows out of a reaction to viewing the needs of the city .  | One of the best dividends from mini-trips is the left-over hunk of two weeks or so in the middle of the summer that is your regular vacation period . Now you have all that time to laze around , catch up on projects , slip in a mini-trip or two without the children ? whatever suits your purpose , just so it is a satisfying change of pace . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work and preparation involved in extended vacations away from home . When a working mother builds a feeling of unity or togetherness into a family , it can become extraordinarily " we " - centered . However good this " we " sense may be , it would be unfortunate if it totally determined a child 's outlook ? or the parents ' , for that matter . While you are building the " we , " it is also well to teach about " others . " This protects against an ingrown form of selfishness , where you have no time for any but your own . A " my family comes first " attitude can foster an insularity and disregard of the needs of others . When that same family unity is put to work on behalf of others , it can develop an outward look and compassion that is nourishing to the spirits of children and adults alike . Meaningful involvement for all the family can be found wherever you look ? from service to the very young , to the aged , to the orphaned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic involvement for community good and the neighborliness that reaches strangers in need of help , as well as friends . Plans and goals for such family activities are dinner topics . They are mini-trip destinations . They are vacation projects . They are true togetherness . The whole family need not be united in one place or activity or philosophy to produce togetherness . It can flourish while each member is off by himself , engaged in his own separate business , or in the midst of a lively exchange of  | widely differing points of view . A brother who thinks to address a letter home from camp to a younger brother or sister practices togetherness ; the father who remembers an amusing riddle to ask his five-year-old daughter practices togetherness ; the mother who gets up before the rest of the family to be alone while she puts the first of the day 's machinery in motion for the family is practicing togetherness ; so are the parents who hear out their teenager with equanimity as he asserts his individuality and independence . The gung-ho , blow-the-whistle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family unity . Shared experiences are vital for a cohesive family , but they can be in small things as well as large ones . It may not be the actual going someplace together that makes the most impact , but the planning and getting ready that make the group work as one . It can be in conversation that deals not only with people and things , but with feelings and attitudes . The greater part of togetherness may go unheralded as togetherness in the day-to-day business of living , but if it is not there , a family will be the less for the lack of it .  | YOU DID N'T TAKE OUT THE TRASH " I did n't know I was supposed to , " your eight-year-old replies . You have told him often enough , heaven knows , but you did n't tell him today . What is wrong here ? That old familiar lack of communication . There are no clear , definite instructions for the child , and therefore he feels no clear , definite responsibility . If your children are not getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message clearly , it is time to straighten out the communication lines . It may be that the messages are not getting over because you have not fixed firmly in your own mind what needs to be done or how much the children can help . Nothing is put on a regular basis ; you ask for help on impulse , only as the need comes up . Maybe you feel it is a little unfair to ask your children to take over a regular part of the work you used to do around the house . Or you may think that the price of your being away from home is high enough for children to pay  | without asking them to do housework , too . You may even feel a little guilty about asking them for help if it makes it easier for you to have a job . Or you are afraid your children might resent your having a job if they have to do part of " your " work at home . None of this is good reasoning . One of the main contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the children 's help around the house can become important and necessary in their own eyes . It is not make-work to keep Johnny occupied or because Mother thinks it is good for his character . For the working mother , Johnny 's help is plainly necessary . You are not asking for his cooperation . You expect it . It is essential to the household operation . Even if you could do all the housework and hold a job , too , you should n't . A working mother has a splendid opportunity to teach her children responsibility to the family as a whole and to allow them to make their contributions to its solidarity . Whether you work or not , there is no reason why you should be making a child 's bed or picking up his clothes if he is capable of doing it for himself . All through his childhood , you should be teaching him to take over more and more of the job of his own care . Otherwise you are robbing him of the full use of his own powers by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person doing for himself does not foreclose providing help when help is needed or volunteering a natural courtesy or kindness to another family member ; but in the routine of daily living , a child should do those things for himself that he is capable of doing . You should , therefore , set two definite goals : first , to determine the tasks it is reasonable to expect the child to do ; and second , to obtain his cooperation in doing them . Both goals are practical only if the children 's views are given  | some consideration , too , although their ideas of what they will or will not do may not be deciding factors . Your discussion of the work should involve more than who will do what . You and the other family members will be deciding not only what needs to be done and what the responsibility of each person is , but also when the work must be done and what is the acceptable quality for the work . The children 's views in all of these areas are important . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be done every day . It should be understood at the beginning that instructions for routine jobs do not have to be repeated every day . The easiest routine jobs to assign ? and to accept ? are those related to each person . Even a small child can readily see that it is reasonable for him to make his own bed . Small children , in fact , almost invariably take pride in being expected to do such jobs and do them well . Their beds , after all , are very personal possessions ; so are their clothes and toys , and it is expected as a matter of course that they will care for their own possessions . As soon as children are capable of doing so , they should be bathing themselves and taking care of personal hygiene , making their own beds , hanging up their own clothes , putting their laundry where it belongs , straightening their rooms , putting their own things away in their proper places . These tasks should be considered as natural for them as tying their own shoes when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs that take care of their own daily living that clear and smooth their own paths . Children need not be asked to do these personal-care tasks or told to do them ; an effective discussion will make it obvious that each person is responsible for his own care to the extent that he is capable . After all , he has to get up every  | morning , he has to get dressed , and in our society , or at least in most of it , teeth-brushing and face-washing are a part of accepted standards of cleanliness , and making beds and hanging up clothes a part of an orderly life . If you teach your child the habits that make the beginning of each as effortless , as free from decision-making and as painless as possible , you give him a pattern of living that will make his adult life a great deal less encumbered and more satisfying to him . Why need a person be confronted each morning with the dislike of responsibilities that are so clearly his , when he can learn to do them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve if you realize that when parents are not teaching specific habits , the children are learning others . If you are not teaching them to pick up their clothes , they are learning to leave them where they drop them . If you are not teaching them to help with the family 's work , they are learning that they do not have to contribute of themselves or their time to the family . If you are not teaching them at least to share with others the possessions they no longer need or even want , they are learning to hoard and let go to waste what others could put to use . Besides personal care , there are other routine jobs that need to be done to keep the household running . These are family jobs ? the table to be set , meals prepared , dishes done , trash taken out . Such jobs can be negotiated before decisions are made . Take time for a discussion of who will do what . There may be loud yells and protests , and it is worth the trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taking out the trash , or been asked to take out the trash , for his " whole life , " and he is sick of it ? Can this job be given to another ? Can it be put on a rotating basis ,  | so that one week or month one person does it , the next week or month another person takes over ? When the discussion is over , the jobs should be clearly assigned and clearly understood . Each person has certain jobs to be done regularly and the family will depend upon him to do them . If it is a child 's job to take out the trash , he must understand that he will take it out every day ; he will put it out in the morning before he goes to school so that it can be picked up by the collectors or take it to the incinerator ; if any litter spills , he is to pick it up ; the wastebaskets when emptied are to be put back in their proper places and not left by the kitchen door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the child . He understands that the trash must be taken out , it is his job to do it , there is a specific time when he must do it , and what is involved in doing an acceptable job . The division of family jobs can take into account the age of the child , the sex , their interests . A teenage daughter interested in sewing might volunteer to take on the mending jobs if someone else will do the vacuuming . Each family member should be taught to operate the household appliances as soon as he is capable of doing so , which can be sooner than you think . He can master the operation of the washing machine , the dryer , the vacuum cleaner . A daughter of six might consider a toy vacuum cleaner boring when she can do an acceptable and needed job with a real vacuum and get much more pride and satisfaction from it . Teach every family member to cook at least the basics . More trouble than it 's worth ? If you think so , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn , and setting a low value on what you can give them by your teaching . Children learn a great deal more than just cook-  | ing when they follow recipes , measure accurately and produce a worthwhile end-product of their own . They also discover the pleasure that comes from making something that others can admire and enjoy . Learning to cook has great appeal for children , both boys and girls . They will respond enthusiastically to the idea of learning a bit of French cooking , or perhaps the Italian or Chinese cuisines . Slicing celery diagonally for a Chinese dish is a matter of curiosity to a child . How and why did the Chinese decide to slice vegetables that way ? How is it that pasta is the basis for so much of the Italian cuisine ? Why do the French enjoy wine in their dishes ? Most children are entranced with the sounds of words and the names of dishes and why things are the way they are . The origins of dishes as well as cooking techniques are all great interest-getters for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are working toward becoming a good basic cook , too . If you already are such a cook , share your knowledge with your children ; if you are not , enjoy learning with them . Is it worth the trouble ? A most emphatic yes ? not only for the shared experience , or for what the children learn , but for the genuine help they can be as they master the skills . Besides , as long as you are in the kitchen with them , you can also teach them where everything goes : pots and pans always in the same places , the electric skillet here , the grater there , plates on the first shelf , glasses in the cupboard by the sink . When they do dishes , you can expect a good job of putting away in the proper places . Youngsters can take turns helping you with the dishes . This can be such a rewarding time for both of you that you might consider keeping dishwashing a job that is primarily yours with the children rotating in sharing it with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time alone with you when they do not have to share your attention with anyone else . In all of these jobs , the children are not helping Mother with her work . Each is doing his part of the family 's work . These are the modern-day versions of the fence-mending , water-pumping , chicken-feeding , cow-milking kinds of work children used to do , and which made them , in their own eyes as well as those of their parents , essential family members . Working mothers should find little to disagree with here . It all sounds wonderful . What parents would n't want their children to pick up after themselves and help around the house ? The joker is , how do you get them to do it ? There are three specific things you can do that will help children do their daily work with a minimum of fuss . First , you make it possible for them to do the job , and do it well . If they are to hang up their clothes , are the clothes rods or hangers low enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds , are they able to roll them out from the wall so they can get to both sides to do a decent job of bedmaking ? A child is not so unobservant that he does n't know a sloppy-looking bed from a neat one . If he is to set the table , can he reach the dishes ? Is there a sturdy , safe stepstool he can use ? If he is to buy the milk for the family , is change for the milk machine kept in a special jar or cup so that it is available when he needs it ? Second , you teach them how to do the job . If they are to put their own laundry through the washer and dryer , you teach them how to operate the appliances , give them the directions for the soap or detergent to use , tell them the importance of taking the clothes straight from the machines . ( If they are also responsible for their own ironing , they will be happy to know ways of washing and drying that cut  | down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds fast and efficiently and do a good job . You also keep up with the child 's expanding abilities . Where a daughter may have been helping set the table , putting out the salt and pepper , the butter , perhaps preparing part of the food , let her learn to take over whole jobs . She may take greater satisfaction in preparing the entire salad than in just washing the lettuce for you ; or in fixing all of a light Saturday breakfast instead of just making the toast . These may not be tasks you would regularly expect from them , nor can you push them too fast ; but do not hold them back , either , by always assigning the repetitive jobs of pouring water , putting out napkins , clearing the table . ( You do risk having an over-eager young chef who will want dearly to make the sauce or salad or main course at a time when every minute counts or when the meal must turn out perfectly . On such occasions , forget about being the first working mother nominated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no thanks this time . " ) Children enjoy variety as much as you . Teach them as much as you can , and as much as they can absorb , of the daily business of living beyond the routines . You can take their routine jobs occasionally , and let them have a crack at learning the more creative . No wonder a boy hollers about taking out the trash if he has done it for months , and that is as interesting or challenging a job as he has ever been given to do . Ask any boy and he will tell you that cooking is more fun than toting trash . ( He may also tell you that playing ball or watching TV is more fun than either cooking or toting trash , but that is n't what you asked him . ) Sometimes you teach by encouragement , too . A young dawdler in the morning , newly capable of dressing himself , may need a time or two , or more , when you stop what you are doing to give your time to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by giving him your attention and encouragement . What he really learns is that he is n't going to lose out just because he is less dependent upon you . Third , you see that the routine job is done regularly until the habit is established . This means that you do not let them skip a morning making their bed because it is inconvenient for them or for you . You do not accept from them , " I 'll do it after school . " You do not say , " Go on . I 'll do it for you , " or " Never mind , you 'll be late . " You do not do it for them . You let them be late . Letting them be late , of course , may not be so simple either . A missed school bus can throw a whole family off schedule , and make you late for work as well as the child tardy at school . If you want the habit to mean business , though , you will have to grit your teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or else plan a time to launch this kind of habit-forming when you can best manage the inconvenience that such incidents might cause . It may be difficult to reconcile putting bedmaking by your daughter ahead of a board meeting you must attend or a letter your boss needs typed . If you feel you ca n't miss work simply to follow through at home , then plan on getting the child up earlier and yourself , too , if that is what it takes . Make every effort to make it likely that the job can and will be done . If you want their morning habits to take hold and quickly , you should try not to miss a day in reinforcing the habit . The jobs must be done when they are supposed to be done , and done by them , or the habit will never be established and the purpose destroyed . It does not take long to set these habits ? often only a few repetitions ? and the more inconvenience caused the child through his own carelessness in not doing the jobs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always occasions where a routine has to be changed to meet an emergency , but until  | it becomes a routine try not to let a job be postponed ; have it done on a regular basis at a regular time every day . When the child has learned the routine , the jobs will be done as a matter of course . He will have acquired the habits for taking care of his own things . Such a learning process is not always easy for the parent to supervise and might seem to be especially difficult for the working mother . Actually , she has an advantage in that she herself must be on a schedule . She is not in the position of the mother who , if the children forget to pick up their pajamas or leave their beds unmade , has the rest of the day before her and can , and often does , do their work for them . The working mother needs to have those pajamas picked up and the beds made because she simply does not have the time to do those tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting someone else do their jobs for them ; the children must do them . The working mother who is up with her children and getting ready along with them , is on the spot to guide them through their regular routine of doing for themselves . It is never too late to begin such schedules , and , in fact , many older children who have never had such organization are pleased and willing to follow a routine established with , and followed by , their parents as well as themselves . It should go without saying , that it is hopeless to establish routines for children to follow if you follow none yourself . It is asking too much that your children adopt routines for getting up and getting dressed and putting their things away if you consistently oversleep , and have no time for your own schedules , much less theirs . Cooperation and harmony are impossible unless the routines include all family members . One person can not deal himself out or continually make excuses and expect peaceful coexistence . It is surprising how often it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cultivate few of their own . It is true that some children take to routines more easily than others . Some children are easier to live with as individuals than others , though this may not make them any less individual . They simply accept routines as a sensible and reasonable part of life . The difficult child , on the other hand , may be the one who actually has the most to gain from regular habits and may thrive once a routine has been established that gives him a sense of responsibility and security . Make certain that the tasks that are expected of him are within his ability to do and do well . Keep close but discreet supervision until the habit is established . Success in adopting a useful habit can provide great satisfaction for the child who lacks confidence and has not had much experience with success in the past . For this child , give special consideration to ways of making the jobs not only possible to do but as interesting and certain of success as you can . Such measures can sometimes ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs expected of him . For example , new and pretty contour sheets might make bedmaking easier and more attractive for a daughter who dislikes the job . A bright new sponge kept by the tub can remind young bathers to clean the ring before they leave . The proper wrappings , special containers and favorite foods can help a youngster enjoy preparing his lunchbox . Rearranging furniture , providing boxes , baskets and shelves , and helping your reluctant helper decide what goes where can make the putting away of his things easier and more inviting to do . If there is just one child in the family , trading jobs between parent and child provides a " We 're all in this together " feeling . The idea of growing up and into jobs that require increasing family responsibility can set a family  | tradition . If the child feels important , needed and grownup , there is a better chance of getting the jobs done pleasantly . Start off your habit-forming program for jobs with a fanfare ; call a special planning session and involve the whole family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though they may groan or snicker to preserve their pride . Ignore these adolescent rituals , which you have to do anyway if you are to survive the groaning and snickering period . Go on with your production , and they will likely forget about preserving their status when the conversation warms up over who is doing what work . Whatever decisions come out of such a discussion group , follow up on them immediately . Children admire instant translation of plans into action , and this is one time it makes sense . Do not overdo the job assignments . A certain number of rules are necessary for an orderly life , but too many become difficult for you to enforce and unpleasant to live with . You have to remember that your own time at home is limited , and you ca n't spend all of it in supervision , nor can you expect your husband to . The whole business of routine tasks could take no more than half an hour of a child 's time , done with a minimum of mental effort on his part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if left to a hit-or-miss basis , could run to hours of arguments , excuses , scoldings and tears . By taking the time to work out with the child a specific schedule of what needs to be done , what the responsibility of each person is , when the work must be done and what is acceptable quality for the work , you have gone a long way toward eliminating scene after scene of " I told you to " and " I did n't know you meant today . " Freedom and the much-prized informality of life can scarcely be jeopardized by a pattern of living that teaches  | a child to get up , get dressed , do the jobs that have to be done , and face the rest of the day unencumbered by what still must be done or will be left undone . This does , of course , make life easier for you as a working mother , but consider what you have also given your children ? habits for daily living that will benefit them all their lives .  | THE LIBRARY IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wails your ten-year-old . Working mothers may not be victimized by this sort of cruelty to parents any more often than stay-home mothers , but it probably causes them more pain . The whole house can be put in an uproar with cries of " Why did n't you tell me sooner ? " and " It was n't regular homework . " Frantic searching for some sort of make-do material will follow , and your limited time and need to stick to a schedule will both be sacrificed to the project . The working mother can also make such a homework crisis into one of those endless reasons she dredges up for blaming herself . If she were home , she could keep up with the children 's homework . If she is especially good at torturing herself , she can also come up with such thoughts as its riot being the child 's fault , but hers , that he does not have his report ready for tomorrow ? that as a matter of fact , if it  | were not for her working , he would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers are not exempt from the national obsession gripping parents over their children 's performance in school . From the time a child enters kindergarten , his reports may be examined by anxious parents with college boards in mind . If pressure and prodding do not produce results , a parent may even wind up doing the child 's work for him . The working mother may be especially susceptible to such temptation if she feels the child must succeed as a student so that she wo n't appear to have failed as a working mother . Actually , the working mother has a splendid opportunity to cut loose from the practice of running her child 's school career . Because of her job and limited time , the children may learn early that they must do their work themselves and take the responsibility for having it ready or not . Still , the how and when of a child 's homework can be a major problem for even the wisest of working mothers . It is only natural when you organize your own time and follow a schedule that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time wisely too . You know it pays off for you and you feel your children will gain similar benefits by having schedules for their homework . This may be understandable , but it can also be unrealistic and unwise . You guide the children through a schedule in the morning and see to it that they take care of their jobs in the evening . You are asking a lot of yourself , and of them , if you try to put their homework on a specific schedule , too . It can be more frustrating than it is worth to try to keep yourself scheduled most of the time and everyone around you , too . If a child likes the idea of a certain time to do his homework and wants to follow a schedule , fine ; but that is generally not the child with the homework problem . The one  | who is not interested in doing his homework at any time , much less at a regular time , is the child who most tempts the mother to try to organize his life , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grades . Many experts advise a strict schedule for homework . If the child is not doing well in school , that is often the first piece of advice you will get . The child should have a quiet place by himself , and the study hour should begin at the same time every day . It should not vary by even as much as five minutes , say some experts . These recommendations are handed out almost as prescriptions ? the medicine a failing child needs in order to survive in school . They are designed to get the most output from a child in terms of written homework , material memorized and whatever else it takes to improve his grades in specific subjects . Such recommendations may have little to do with the rest of the child 's life or that of the family 's . Because a working mother may often wish she had more time to help her child , and because she may also be caught up in the universal preoccupation with the achievement of children in school , she may clutch at a homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself or to the child . The chief danger in rigid homework schedules for a child who is not doing well in school is that the parent may consider it the magic key , the missing ingredient that will produce better grades . The working mother may desperately want the child to achieve in school ? for his own good and also because it eases her worry about the harm she feels her outside work may be doing him . She may be sensitive , too , as most working mothers are , to thoughtless , gratuitous and sometimes malicious remarks about the harmful effects of a mother 's work upon a child 's school performance . Thus , she is particularly vulnerable to suggestions for improving  | her child 's performance . If she becomes convinced that a rigid schedule is the answer and the child will not willingly adopt one , warfare of one kind or another is bound to erupt . It is a war that neither side can win . Johnny may go to his room , sit at his desk , adjust the light properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may be made to copy out pages of homework , do the problems , memorize the assignment ? sometimes under threat of near extinction ? but if he is not interested in learning what is on the page in front of him , you can not make him . Nobody can put the information into the child 's head , digest it for him and make it part of him . And there is not an expert alive who knows of a formula that will automatically provide motivation for any child who needs it . The answer to an orderly approach to homework may lie elsewhere than in a specific and rigid schedule for doing it . If you do not have the child 's other routines for daily living established , do so . Put him on a regular schedule for getting up , getting dressed , having breakfast , making his bed , hanging up his clothes , straightening his room , doing the family jobs assigned to him , putting out his clothes for the next day and getting to bed . This is a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it calls for mental exertion . The tasks are all far removed from homework ; nonetheless , they teach an orderly approach to responsibilities . They are far easier for the child to accept because they take care of immediate physical needs , not some far-off entrance exam for a college or the means for making a good living someday . Such a routine for teaching orderly habits and responsibility is far more likely to have carry-over value to homework habits than the reverse . If the child now has no orderly habits ? homework or otherwise ? then start with his habits for personal care and daily living . What you are aiming for is his eventual acceptance of a daily way of living  | that will require less direction from you and more from himself . As he becomes accustomed to a life that is more ordered because he puts his things away , a life that is less cluttered and complicated because he does his daily tasks , he will be far more likely to apply this approach to other areas of his life . Such a prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishment , or of security , or of pride , that he also needs . With the daily routines established , you can ease the child into relating his homework period to the regular activities of others in the family . He may thus be doing his homework on a schedule but not necessarily by the clock . For example , while you are finishing up the dishes or preparing part of tomorrow night 's dinner , a fledgling student could sit at a nearby table to work . Why should he be closed off in a room by himself to do homework that does not involve intense concentration ? Most homework can be done within the famil roue , not isolated from .. it . it Abe Lincoln apparently learned a goocT eal stretched out by the fire in his log cabin " family room . " Indeed , the child may learn more and enjoy it more if he can tell you about something interesting ' he has just read , ask you questions about it , or get other help if he needs it . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes absorbed in his work so that you do not interrupt him , he can do all the concentrating he needs to do . If you are doing your own work , and not initiating any conversations yourself and keeping his talk confined to the subject matter of his homework , he can accomplish a great deal . When he can discuss the subjects with you , he is actually reviewing or going through the equivalent of reciting in class . It is excellent practice for his recitation if he wishes to tell you sections of what he has read ; there is also the review value , the shared experience and , not incidentally , the information you had forgotten or  | never learned yourself . If there is specific memory work to do and there is too much activity going on with other members of the family , you can suggest that he estimate how long it will take him to memorize the material , set a timer for him and have him go to another room to work on it . Homework time can also be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn specific ways for handling assignments effectively . For example , show him how to look through the pages he must cover , reading all the main headings , looking over all the maps , pictures and other illustrations , and reading the captions under them . Then if he turns to the end of the chapter , there is usually a summary and questions or a study guide . If he reads these first he will have an idea of some of the important things to be covered in the chapter before he ever reads it . If there are words in the questions that he does not understand , now is a good time to find out what they mean . You can help him along by letting him guess the word and ask if that is right . Do n't always tell him what words mean , but do n't turn off help altogether either . ( If he brings a dictionary along to the kitchen table with him , it is easy for him to look the words up himself . ) By the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already familiar with the general subject and is reading with a purpose . Some of the more difficult words will not slow him down , and what he reads will make more sense to him . If you settle on such a pattern for the child 's homework , what you are doing at the time is important , too . Do not leave everything else so you can sit with him while he does his homework to keep him company , to answer questions , and generally to try to make it more enjoyable for him . The problem is that he will not be doing the work himself and will get no feeling of accomplishment . On the other hand , do n't settle down to reading or watch-  | ing TV or anything else that absorbs most or all of your attention . The child will need to ask you questions , and you will find it irritating to be pulled from an absorbing book to help translate a question on mathematical sets or the root word that ends in a vowel-consonant-e . Homework time is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own housework . It does not occupy much of your mental capacity ; yet it keeps you from becoming too involved in what should be your child 's work . You are getting something done yourself and can still comfortably field any questions he may have and give him a boost along when he needs it . In the end , only the child can make his homework a useful and educational experience , but you can encourage , guide and help stimulate his interest in succeeding , which is a prime motivator in itself . As he gains confidence , he will more than likely move off to another room to do his homework on his own . A child 's achievement in school at somewhere near the level of his ability can be vital to his well-being for reasons other than gaining a passport to college or landing a good job someday . In many schools , good grades are also the key to many other school activities . For instance , if the child does not achieve and maintain specified grade averages , all kinds of clubs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious honorary societies arc closed to him . The very youngster who may desperately need wide opportunities for achieving status and for " belonging " may be automatically barred from the more legitimate means of obtaining them . Since only a rare child , particularly at junior and senior high school , can survive as a " loner , " the outcast must then seek friends from among other failures . If status in a group can not be won in recognized school activities , he may seek it through irresponsible , reckless or  | dangerous activities . A youngster is not able to reckon the price he pays for such recognition ; to him , the price is irrelevant because he must " belong " somewhere . This is the real worry a working mother may face with a child who is " underachieving " ? the damaging social and moral consequences his school failure may induce . Mothers who must work to help support their families and do not have the time or money for corrective help for their children face a special kind of hell in worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worry and the frustration , but they at least have the opportunity to decide if rearrangement of their work schedules may help provide solutions . They obviously will not solve problems by automatically quitting their jobs and staying home to wring their hands and goad their children to do better . But they most certainly should look at their jobs to see if they may be contributing to the problem . Does your work leave the child without adequate supervision ? Does your work result in erratic household routines that more often than not produce arguments and tension instead of purposeful relationships ? Does your work leave you little or no time for guidance and help when the child needs it ? If you have any yes answers here , you may well need to straighten out your job arrangements . Money may be able to solve inadequate supervision problems and provide extra help in tutoring or for diagnostic counseling ; other problems will need not money but your time , and that will mean a face-to-face look at your job and the changes that should be made . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider other aspects that may be contributing to the child 's failure . For your own sake and because your job will be the number one suspect in any difficulties that arise with your child 's behavior , it is sensible to be as honest and  | objective as you can in your assessment of your job 's impact on his life . If you have more than one child , the time and thought you must spend on school matters are obviously increased . With planning you can make some of the experiences with the first child stretch to cover the other children . To give you an idea of the enormity of the school 's place in your life , multiply by twelve for every child in the family to find the number of school years you will be exposed to . If you have three children , for example , you will have thirty-six cumulative school years to see them through . This adds up to a formidable procession of school activities ranging from show-and-tell , plays , assemblies , field trips , science fairs , posters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences . Since junior and senior high school students often have as many as six teachers for different subjects each year , with three children you can easily be exposed to as many as a hundred teachers during your children 's school years . These statistics may be somewhat unnerving , but there are ways to spread your experience so that you are not starting from scratch each time . By knowing that you will be going back over some of these experiences each year , you can remember to draw on what you can profit by , the next time around . Consider such small matters as costumes ( which might not seem so small when a child is approaching near hysteria for want of a witch hat ) and the major problems , which homework can sometimes be . Here is one way of easing the strain . Equip your home with reference books , which are valuable educational aids for the whole family . The library might not always close before a project is completed , or started , but home reference material can save you much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the library . A set of encyclopedias is a must along with a good dictionary and an atlas . Secondhand sets of encyclopedias are good buys , since much of a child 's reference needs is not outdated . Much of the part that is can be covered by a library the children can set up for themselves . Such a library is one of the least expensive but most rewarding ways to expand your home reference materials . Magazines , newspapers and other periodicals are publishing an unprecedented quantity of sound information covering the whole range of human study . In one month , from a few periodicals coming into your house , your children can obtain material for their files that might cover such subjects as a trip to ancient Egypt , the birth of a child , a heart transplant , examples of a great architect 's work , the story of Lincoln 's assassination , a history of black culture and a pictorial account of a trip to the moon . No text or reference work could match the timeliness of the treatment given most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library for use by the children in their individual projects . Even advertisements that come in the mail , particularly from book publishers and travel bureaus , provide illustrations that can be used in school work . Booklets picked up when sightseeing and postcards from art galleries can all provide important source material for the child ? for the whole family , actually . To organize all of this material , you will need a file cabinet . These are the most overlooked pieces of equipment in any home . You can have file cabinets for general family use , and each child would profit with at least one or two file drawers for his own use . Surplus stores and secondhand office-supply stores offer files in excellent condition and at good prices . They are one of the best bargains you can find . They come in all sizes from one-drawer stackable units up to four-drawer legal size . They can be painted or sten-  | ciled to suit the most conservative or the most way-out decor . If it comes to a choice of space in a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawers . They are easier to open , they display their contents more efficiently , they can hold not only the papers they were intended for , but also socks , underwear and other clothing , shoes , toys and assorted sports equipment . The two-drawer size can serve as a bedside table , or two of them can make the ends of a desk with a flat surface stretched across the top . Most important , they can be used by the schoolchild and the rest of the family for what they were designed ? to organize and file information . You can help your children set up their reference library by providing the file cabinets and a place for them , but the children can and will want to do most of the work . They can decide the subject-matter headings ? including their own interests and the subjects they are studying in school . For science projects they may choose such categories as space , medicine , biology , conservation , air pollution . They may add files for art , music , literature , geography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of establishing and maintaining such files , the children learn to organize , to research , to generalize , to select and discard , to retrieve information when they need it , to build their own library of useful information , to discover a particular field of interest that they can pursue with great relish through all their school years . Through all the cumulative school years , your children will also be needing paper , pencils , glue , folders , crayons , colored pencils , rulers , staples , tape and other materials for their projects . Have a place for these supplies and keep them on hand . A last-minute trip for glue or colored pencils can be as aggravating as a last-minute trip for eggs , so have  | the children keep track of school supplies and add them to your shopping list when needed . With such organization , you are not doing the creative work that properly belongs to the child , but you are making it easier and more inviting for him to do it . You also save on many last-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child what he has n't done for himself just to prevent a tearful scene and have the project over with . Trips to the library are obviously irreplaceable experiences for children , and fortunately more and more schools are providing additional time for library use at the school . But when you work and the child is not able to get to the pubic library by himself whenever he wants to go , your own library of reference works and files can be a valuable resource for him and a timesaver for you . You can also make the time and effort you invest in extracurricular school activities go farther . Many of these experiences will be repeated by each succeeding child . Though curriculums and teaching techniques may change drastically at times , the primary grades can be counted on to continue having plays and skits , and the upper grades will go right on having assemblies and drama productions . If you have more than one child , you can count on another round of these activities just as you might expect another bout with mumps or chicken pox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school plays , and spring flowers and trees ; there will be Winnie-the-Poohs and Captain Hooks and knights and witches along with spacemen and beatniks . Your oldest child may have played Captain Hook in the third-grade play , for which you stitched together a long black cloak in the spare time you did n't have . Two years later , your first-grader lands the role of the Wicked Witch . Why in the world did n't you save Captain Hook 's cloak ? It would have made a perfect cape for the witch . To avoid  | such doubling of effort , save any parts of costumes that might team up in a different combination for the next child coming along . If you keep these bits and pieces in a specific drawer or box where you can find them again , you will have a basic wardrobe department that can see you through many a play as well as Halloween and costume parties . A cape can produce the major part of the witch or Captain Hook , and it can also make a knight or a mad scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tights can help costume an elf , a court jester , a man from Mars , or the back end of almost any animal . An inexpensive long hairpiece from the dime store can become the flowing tresses of Guinevere , a Hawaiian dancer , a hippie , or even the tail of a horse . A long-sleeved ruffled blouse and a vest can take you through many a historical drama . Such items plus an old sheet and a pillow case for assorted angels and ghosts can form the basis of a small but versatile costume department . There are other extracurricular activities at school that can involve you directly ? the PTA , room mother and the rest . They are sometimes the subject of much derision , but they are also a fact of life . When your child is in school and he wants you to participate in these activities , interesting to you or not , you most likely will feel that you must take part at some time . At the times when you feel you can take on such activities , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a call to help out . Find out what sorts of participation might be needed , pick what you think you can do adequately and then volunteer for it . If you wait , you may be asked for something you ca n't or wo n't be able to do , and you wind up being trapped because you hate to say No . Make it easier for yourself and volunteer . Say to the teacher , the head of the PTA , the Brownie leader , " I want to help  | this year if I can . I can not make phone calls and I can not do regular committee work , but I can take the children on a field trip , I can send refreshments , I can help serve at some of the meetings . " The recipient will be astonished and delighted to have acquired a real , live volunteer , and you will be contributing what you can to the organization from which your child benefits . Another perennial school event is the parent-teacher conference ? or at least it ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs because unfortunately they are not usually sought by either the parents or teacher unless the child is having trouble of one sort or another . Such school conferences may be especially difficult for you as a working mother , partly because your time is limited and you must make special arrangements to permit you to get to a conference that is usually set during or just after school hours . You may also feel at a disadvantage because you are a working mother . It can sometimes take just one experience with a teacher or guidance counselor who begins a conference with " You work , do n't you ? " to intimidate a working mother . You may find yourself responding by nodding your head numbly and enduring the moment or two of silence while the counselor reflects upon the obvious inadequacies of your child 's home life . At this point , you may even hesitate to bring up problems that are legitimately related to the school or classroom environment and may wind up being more concerned with the teacher approving of you than in diagnosing your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems before you arrange a conference with his teacher . Instead , make an appointment within a few weeks after school starts . Such meetings should be considered as important to your child as regular checkups at the doctor 's . Arrange for them  | whether he is doing well or not . They are good preventive medicine . Most teachers appreciate the opportunity to meet the parents of the child they will be teaching for nine months ; it can help them do a better job and help the child , too . Do not assume , for example , that the teacher will automatically know or will find out that the child has had difficulty in reading . Such - information may or may not be noted on a child 's record , may or may not be known to the teacher . Make certain it is known . A child 's special interests as well as his problem areas are also worth pointing out ; the fact that you are working and a bit about brothers and sisters may be helpful for the teacher to know . Follow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether the child is doing well or not . Some schools can arrange for conferences with parents early in the morning or in the evening , but most prefer not to . It may be difficult to arrange your time , but it is worthwhile to do so . If possible , the father should come to the conference , too , or even go in place of you . One way or the other , though , you should arrange for this educational checkup . It shows the child you are interested in his school work , it can help the teacher teach , it makes conversation with your youngster about his school work more meaningful and interesting to you both , and it takes you off the defensive , a not-unimportant point . If your child is fortunate enough to have a fine teacher , you will be missing a lot by not meeting and knowing that person . Arrange a conference if for no other reason than a thank you . You will come away with much more than you have given . If your child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be objective in deciding how best he can be helped . Guidance counselors and teachers should be listened to for the additional insights they may provide , but in the end you  | should recognize that you are an expert , too . Do not let your confidence in your ability as a parent suffer by being defensive about your job . If your child needs help , do not be put off by the views of others that you are babying your child or pressuring him for better grades . Do not automatically shoulder all the blame any more than you should shift responsibility elsewhere without an honest and searching examination of the situation . If you have good reason to believe , for example , that the classroom environment or the teacher is wrong for the child , make every effort to effect a change . While many children may succeed in spite of a misguided teacher , the experience can be catastrophic for the underachieving child . He may be totally unable to cope with the problem by himself , and whether you work or not has nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel or neurotic teacher . At the same time , if you suspect that your own lack of rapport with the child , your reluctance to discipline or some other aspect of the home environment is at the root of the problem , you must be equally willing to face it . Neither of these actions are likely to be pleasant . Standing firm against a harmful experience at school or making major changes in your job and family life may make extreme demands upon you . But when a child needs help , you have no choice . You may be worrying and waiting for him to " grow out of a stage " when he desperately needs your help . You must be with him enough as a dependable parent to be able to tell the difference .  | DO I HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN ? Please do n't . It will be a waste of time for you and for him . You have already told him three times to go to bed ? what makes you think he will pay any more attention to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parenthood is disciplining the children . Whether you are a strict parent or a permissive one , putting corrective measures into action is never an enjoyable job . Since discipline can be so unpleasant , why do some parents prolong the agony , dragging out sermons , repeating commands , enlarging threats , embroidering wild visions of the good or bad consequences to follow ? Because the words have become a habit , because they are easier than a showdown . It is easier to say " Go to bed " four or five times than to stop what you are doing and see that the child goes to bed . If , once in bed , he keeps hopping out , it is easier to call " Get back in bed , " which he may or may not do , than to go and put him back in bed . Over the long run ,  | of course , it is not easier , for your words grow emptier of meaning the more they are repeated and the child must expand his challenge to you farther and farther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your child can either depend upon you to tell him to do something over and over again before war finally breaks out , or he can depend upon you to follow up at once on what you say . If you are willing to repeat instructions he will be perfectly willing to see how many times you will do so before you are eyeball to eyeball with him . Parenthood is no place for the practice of brinkmanship . It is far easier to establish clear rules for peaceful coexistence and enforce those rules at the first challenge than to spend years issuing orders that carry no real authority . Although discipline is discussed here largely in terms of the special problems of working mothers , it is obviously a matter of concern to fathers , too . The general consensus among the experts in child care , and of most parents with common sense , is that fathers should share in the responsibility for discipline of their children , and that parents should support one another 's disciplinary methods , at least in front of the children . The latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion and decision-making between parents on the general approach to discipline that they will employ . In many ways , discipline may be easier to agree on between parents when the wife works . The mother who stays home all day and assumes most of the responsibility for the child 's behavior may either shift the discipline problems to the father to deal with when he gets home or to ask him to stay out of the matter altogether . When both parents are spending more nearly the same amount of time with the children , there is a likelihood that this balance can help build a good supportive approach to your shared involve-  | ment in discipline . At least there is a change of pace between work and home for both of you , and it may make either parent 's response to discipline problems more easily understood by the other . One of the most common areas of family friction is in getting the children to bed at night . Sometimes , the working mother may be more responsible for the problem than the child is . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are in a relaxed mood and good humor . Your child asks if he may please stay up and watch TV with you for a little while . It is easy to say , " All right , just this once . " It is easy when you feel like it . On other evenings when you are tired and want simply to relax , then it becomes important to you to insist on bedtime . " How many times have I told you to go to bed ? " The child may still dilly-dally along the way , you may tell him ten times more , and when he is finally in bed , it is through your sheer superiority in lung power and/or physical strength . But how can he know when bedtime is , when it is geared to your moods ? How can he know that one night you mean what you say when the next night if he begs to stay up he can , and still another night you might even volunteer the privilege ? Be a dependable parent . Even out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downs . Set definite times for going to bed , adjusting it as the children grow older and allowing for a little flexibility and some extra patience on special occasions . Bedtime for toddlers may mean being in bed with the lights out , while for the older ones it may mean being in their rooms and retired for the evening . A consistent , pleasant routine for the child 's bedtime makes as much sense for the working mother as it does for the child . From the bottle-feeding , burping and lullaby-singing for the infant , through the drinks of water and bedtime stories for little  | people , to a few minutes of conversation and a pleasant good-night for the older child , the investment of time here is one of the best you can make as a working mother . Seeing the child to bed in a dependable , warm and loving atmosphere feeds your need to be a good mother quite as much as it fills the child 's need to be loved and cared for . The " children 's hour " quite possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A pleasant , consistent bedtime for children also preserves time for yourself , whether to relax or to work . This privacy in the evening is important to you and to your husband , and the children 's respect for it is important for them to learn . They learn not that you want them out of the way but that parents have a world of their own , too . The whole household does not revolve around the child 's needs , working mother or not . Actually , children take pleasure in knowing that their parents have interests apart from their own . It is something to grow up to . Dr. Freud notwithstanding , such simple evidence that their parents like each other enough to want time alone just to talk to one another can provide real security for children . It underscores their own place in the family circle as children who are loved and cared for by parents who also love each other . Such rights may be difficult for the working mother to establish , but the whole family is better off when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother might shy away from subjecting her child to what seems to be regimentation or be reluctant to hand out even clearly needed discipline . She has been away from him all day and may feel almost a revulsion for administering any discipline during the short time she does share with him . There is ample opportunity for working mothers to spoil children by trying to make up to them for the time they spend away . If she does discipline , it may be so personally distressing to her  | that she immediately sets about undoing the effects of her actions by trying to make it up to the child . A child 's cries of " I hate you , " his sobs , outrage or resentment at the discipline he has received may be far harder for the working mother to endure than the mother who is at home all day . A child 's outburst , even from the most patently deserved discipline , may cause her concern far beyond its merit . Such scenes make some parents literally i . Actually , a child can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is away from him all day and then sets no boundaries for civilized behavior when she is with him . To his way of thinking , she obviously does n't care . Excessive kindness when he clearly does not deserve it , excessive gifts and excessive catering to wants and demands can be recognized easily by children for the excesses they are . The child may not so easily recognize your motivation , however , and will come to believe he is neglected and mistreated . A child can not be happy without discipline . He can suffer from too little as well as too much . On the other hand , a working mother m4y be so tired and worn-out from a day of coping with other people 's demands , with nothing going right and little accomplished , that once home she administers harsh and unjust punishment to a child who merely wanted her attention and companionship . She is too pressured and anxious herself to recognize or diagnose his need , and his demands simply trigger a response of angry words or actions . A kicking-thecat syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the deadliest enemies of family peace and harmony , for the child in turn will find someone else to kick . It may be his younger sister , or it may be his playmate ? or it may be you if he can figure out a way to even the odds in the fighting . This sort of pecking order is , in fact , the way much family fighting begins . A parent 's mood can set the  | mood of the whole family , whether for a day or a lifetime . No one , least of all a working mother , can maintain composure all of the time or project a warm and sunny outlook when at a particular moment everything may seem pretty sour . Nonetheless , you ought to resist with all the strength you have the deadly destructive habit of yelling and fighting with your children . You yell and fight , they will yell and fight . If you have more than one child , the fighting can increase in quantum jumps . It can sometimes seem almost continuous . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be the most discouraging aspect of family life . It can eventually become a way of living for some families , and many sociologists believe this pattern for family living can be passed from generation to generation . Do everything in your power to keep from feeding such a cancerous growth . Fighting among children is often based in jealousy ? usually as the child 's bid for your attention . Attempts to treat each child equally so that he will not be jealous of another can just make matters worse . You become involved in an endless round of assuaging hurt feelings , which escalate as the child becomes more and more convinced that he does have cause for jealousy , else why would his parents be constantly trying to keep him from being jealous ? It is impossible to give children equal treatment . They should know quite frankly that they will be treated not equally but fairly . You can not hope to give them equal treatment ? you will be an exceptional parent if you manage to treat them fairly most of the time . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job is a critical one . On the other side of the door are children who may be lying in wait to regale you with tales of fights , injustices and other catastrophes  | that apparently only you can arbitrate . Before you walk in , stiffen your spine , lift your chin and resolve to have no part of any of it . If you make the mistake of listening to a replay of a fight , you will have another fight on your hands in the retelling of who did what to whom . Therefore , make absolutely clear to your children that you will not listen to any accounts of fighting between them while you were away . If they know you are not interested in , and will not listen to , their blow-by-blow descriptions , you have eliminated part of the attraction for fighting in the first placeIf they think you will listen , the telling of a fight can be dramatic and exciting for them . Refuse categorically to give them such pleasure . Do not listen to either side and let the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur , perhaps , but when one child can not entice you into punishing another , there is less gratification in the fight . A good way to get the message across that you will not be an audience to them or hold court to judge the guilty is to make clear that any reports on fighting will produce discipline for all parties involved , regardless of where the guilt might lie . Unfair ? Maybe , but ! unless you establish your homecoming as that of Mother returning to the family circle rather than a referee entering the ring , you can count on three rounds or a main event nearly every time you come home . On occasions when you do n't have simple , every-day fighting or a mild disagreement on your hands but a case of open rebellion directed at you , one of the best things you can do is simply withdraw . Do not let the child trap you into a yelling match or an argument . Refuse to be badgered into defending your position . You will never be able to defend it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . It also weakens your authority . If your word is to mean something , your authority must remain intact . Therefore , you  | do not engage in arguments and fights with your children . You do not tolerate such arguments . If you can not refrain from putting in your shouts when the disagreement begins to heat up ? and it can be difficult not to ? then you should withdraw from the scene altogether . Do n't make it a retreat ; simply excuse yourself and go to another room . The " cooling-off " period will be as good for the child as for you . Afterward both parties will be better able to listen , as well as to talk . Parts of family life can be run happily in a democratic manner to the benefit and enjoyment of all its members . Participation by all can build dignity and respect and responsibility . But parents and children are not equals and the child can not be granted the freedom to do as he pleases or the right to tyrannize your life . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family from anarchy and its consequent stresses and strains . Discipline while you are at home is only part of the problem if you are a working mother . What about the discipline administered by the person who cares for your child while you are at work ? What of the child who complains he is being punished unfairly during the day ? How do you handle this ? And what of the child who receives no discipline at all , although you feel he needs it ? How do you handle this ? What if the person caring for your child is also a relative ? your mother or mother-in-law , for example ? More problems here ? Not really . Not if you stay out of the relationship as much as possible . It may be difficult for you to accept , but the way your child relates to another person and that person to your child is actually none of your business ? provided , of course , that his physical , mental or moral well-being is not endangered . You must first assure yourself that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily in-  | dulgent ) and has a serious interest in his welfare . You will also come to an understanding , at the very beginning , concerning the child 's schedule and your standards for behavior and discipline . The problems will arise if you insist that discipline and behavior proceed exactly as they would if you were there . It will be impossible for anyone to substitute successfully for you under these circumstances . It is impossible for another person to discipline exactly as you would . They will not choose the same words that you would to reason with a child ; they might not even try to reason . You first must accept the fact that you can not be in two places at the same time . Neither can you establish rules to cover everything a child might or might not do while you are away , or the methods for handling every discipline need . You simply can not expect 100 percent agreement on the correct handling of the child . Child-guidance experts are nearly unanimous in their counsel that mother and father should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheii they differ , they must not do so in front of the child . The same advice is valid when a third person is involved in administering discipline , although the three-way support becomes more difficult . Though you might agree that it is not wise to countermand a father 's orders in front of the child , you may still find yourself mistakenly trying to make the relationship between the two of them what you think it should be . It is even more difficult to keep from meddling in the relationship between the child and the person who cares for him while you are away . You may well have given the matter of child-rearing and discipline a great deal more thought than your housekeeper , your baby-sitter , your mother , your mother-in-law or whoever else is caring for the child . You worry about it more . From all the information and insight you have gained , you want others in charge of your child  | to put into effect the discipline you think is right . They can not . It is worthwhile to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some bad ? over which you will have no control . He may be treated unfairly in the classroom now and then , he may be spoiled by a grandparent , he may be disliked by a playmate , but you can not spend your life trying to control his relationships with other people . Your own influence on the child is the one you should consider , not everybody else 's . The best you can hope to do is to win your child 's cooperation and have the influence of your own discipline carry over in his relationships with other people . Your own firm and consistent discipline can influence him in making sensible judgments in his behavior with other people . You would rob him of experience he needs if you did not allow him to work out his own relationships with other people . He is entitled to this right to develop his own person . If you have a satisfactory arrangement for the care of your child , and the discipline problems still are a worry , take time for a discussion with your helper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules that are not being enforced by the helper or followed by the child . You expect certain behavior from the child , but when you are not there he " gets away with murder . " Or you are met at the door with reports that he wo n't mind , and he has been told all day : " just wait until your mother gets home ! " You feel the fault is as much with the person caring for your child as with the child . If so , arrange a time for discussion when you can both give full attention . Do not try to accomplish anything in the few minutes ' rush before you leave for work or after you get home . The child should not be there . The whole environment can be discussed , including the areas that are satisfactory . The discipline , or lack of it , need be only one  | factor in the conversation , although it will be your main goal to arrive at an understanding on this point . It is important that you do not repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what he has told you . It is far better in a discussion of this sort to listen to the other person 's views on discipline . After such a talk , you may wish to think the whole matter over before coming to any decision . If a child feels he has you on the defensive , he has you over a barrel . If he knows you worry about his treatment , he may enjoy telling you how terrible his treatment is to get your comfort or attention . Do not display an inordinate amount of interest in what he has to say ; nonetheless , pay very close attention to it . It is vital that you do not undermine the authority of the person in charge of your child . One of the scourges of caring for somebody else 's child can be a taunting " I do n't have to " or " You ca n't make me . " For your part , make clear to the child that certain rules for his behavior apply whether you are with him or not . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him or not , you expect him to abide by certain other rules whether you are with him or not . These may include such things as not going down to the drugstore without your permission , or not jumping on the furniture ( if that drives your housekeeper crazy ) . List the rules he must follow when you are away ; think carefully about them , make them as few as possible , and make them very clear to him . A working mother can not afford to scatter her authority in demands or instructions that are unreasonable or unnecessary . " You behave yourself while I am gone " and " Be a good girl today " are silly statements and just so many  | more words that undermine your authority . What exactly does " behave " and " be good " mean to a child ? Such vague demands are unreasonable . To a small child , being good may mean not soiling a diaper and to another it may mean eating all of his lunch . An automatic " Be good " when leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice day " at least conveys the possibility that there might be some fun in life . Much of what adults say to children is repetitive and boring . Any parent would be sick of hearing over and over again what most children hear from adults . You yourself in a child 's place would probably pay no attention at all to many of the things you say to your own child . Equally ineffective most of the time are the gimmicks that are thought up to produce order , motivate children and lessen the problems of discipline . For example , you may set up charts for good behavior ? a star for the child who goes to bed on time , who picks up his clothes , who makes his bed , who does his work . The system is doomed to failure in most cases because it is simply one more item to do which you do not have time to do . A system of keeping charts may impress a child for three or four days , but if you then forget or " do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up tomorrow " and three or four days go by , you can hardly expect the chart to work ? or the child to be much interested . Such suggestions , unfortunately , usually take time and perseverance a working mother often does not have . It is better not to start that kind of bookkeeping , depending on it to eliminate the need for discipline . Better no system at all than one you do not follow consistently . Even more likely to be doomed to failure are the stars for good behavior while you are away . What is good behavior ? Could you define all the aspects of it ? Does the child know exactly what it means ? What you are trying to accomplish with such a system is to keep your discipline going while  | you are not with the child . But as a practical matter , how are you to decide that he does not deserve a star for good behavior ? What if he says he was good and another says he was bad ? You are asking for more trouble and wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler to level with a child . Tell him what is expected of him . If he does n't perform as he should for the privileges he has been given , then he is obviously not yet mature enough for those privileges . This may mean that if he can not be counted upon to return home on time he can not go until he is responsible enough to be back at the appointed hour ; if he is wasteful or destructive with one of his possessions , then he is not yet mature enough to have that type of possession . For the rest of the problems ? the garden variety of not putting away toys , quarreling , tattling ? these are matters best left to the child and the person in charge of him . If the child complains that his grandmother wo n't let him watch TV or sends him to his room for punishment , and these are not covered by your rules , you can tell him that the matter " is between you and your grandmother . " When Grandmother tells you that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will have to work it out with him . If both parties know that you are not going to adjust their relationship for them , they will adjust it themselves . You could try to give your helper a course in child psychology , but it likely would not take . You can not undermine her authority and your own by making up to the child later . If the housekeeper is dependable and trustworthy and genuinely interested in the welfare of the child , you are doing more harm by interfering , and you should stay out of it . If the child 's well-being is threatened , that is another matter . Do not hesitate for one minute to take whatever steps are necessary to protect him and remove him from a harmful environment .  | One of the best ways to diagnose your child 's needs is to detach yourself from him . Step back and take a good look at the youngster and examine his behavior and relationships with you and other people as if he were not your child . It is much easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with your own child . Is he jealous of a younger or older brother or sister ; is he playing you against his father ; is he rebelling from too strict authority which keeps him from growing because he can not make decisions for himself ; has he been given too much rope for decision-making which he is as yet unable to handle ? Or are you on the whole doing a pretty good job ; is he reasonably responsible , reasonably cheerful , reasonably com-municative ? No expert in child care has the specific answer for every discipline need . You can seek advice and gain a better understanding of behavior problems and their likely causes . But in the end you will have to do your own day-by-day job of discipline ? with some days worse and some days better . If you are a normal parent , there will be a measure of confusion mixed in with your courage and alongside your confidence will be a good deal of anxiety and uncertainty . In the age of the " expert , " your own common sense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to your own feelings and consider your own situation when you try to apply advice ? including what is contained in this book . The major qualification for the job of parent is dependability . It can be doubly important when you are a working mother . Your children must be able to depend upon you for discipline and guidance as well as for love and support . If you are a dependable parent , they can depend upon the fact that you will insist on knowing where they are going and who they are going with ; they can depend  | upon your assigning them a part of the family 's work to do ; they can depend upon your insisting that they meet their responsibilities in school ; they can depend upon your discipline to be consistent , fair , certain and swift if their behavior merits it . Discipline is really more a way of life than a series of isolated responses as they come up . A consistent response to discipline situations takes up less of your energies and creates much less turmoil than reacting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order in the home . It is never too late to shape a new life-style for a family in trouble by beginning a pattern of discipline that can evolve into habits of self-discipline for each family member . Such a goal mayeseem difficult and frustrating at first because you can not control all of the other family members ' reactions , and cooperation may seem slow in coming . But confident statements by you of your determination to establish new goals for the family , and your own perseverance at the job , can be rewarding . You can sometimes see dramatic changes in the outlook of a child who begins to enjoy a routine of life and a firm measure of discipline . In what seems to be a hopeless houseful of ruffians , you can find hope if you can discipline yourself into being dependable and consistent , and fair and firm , in the manner in which you treat your children . Another large order , but then the raising of responsible human beings is no small task . It ought to be considered carefully and respectfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOMETHING HAPPENS WHEN I 'M NOT THERE ? If " something " does happen , it is not the worrying that you do that will help meet the emergency . Although it is difficult not to worry ( many women seem to feel they are not meeting their obligations to their children if they do not worry ) , you are much better off if you substitute action for mental hand-wringing . The first thing to do is to make certain that you can be reached by phone or that a message can be sent to you quickly if the need arises . If your job allows you a good deal of independent management of your own time , get in the habit of leaving word at home or at your office where you will be . This need not mean that you will be calling in to report your actions on the half hour , but it is a simple matter ? and good business as well as home management ? to say where you are going when you are to be out of touch with your normal base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are lunching.  | If you have to run an errand , leave word where you are going and when you expect to be back . If you are away from your office for the day , somebody either in the office or at home ought to know your general whereabouts at least . Another obvious way to prepare for an emergency is to know how to get needed help as quickly as possible and to see that whoever is substituting for you also has this information . A list of telephone numbers and addresses that would be needed if an emergency arises is an essential . Take time to look up the correct and complete information necessary to prepare an adequate emergency list . Seconds can count when a child is hurt . Also , such household emergencies as sparks from the furnace or a leaking gas pipe can be saved from becoming disasters by quick action to get help . When the " something " happens you will have good reason to worry if priceless time is wasted fumbling through a phone book . Your emergency list might include most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Make certain you list the correct precinct or station house ) Ambulance ( Make certain it is one that serves the , hospital you have listed ) Rescue Squad ( Often a part of fire-department service ) Poison Control Center ( Listed as such in the phone book ) Medical Doctor Dentist Hospital ( Make certain it is one your doctors are affiliated with ) Pharmacy  | Personal Your business telephone Your employer 's name and telephone Your husband 's business telephone Name and telephone of your husband 's employer Clergyman Your nearest neighbor ( One who is ordinarily at home and is aware that the telephone is listed by you for emergency need ) Nearby relative andlor close friend Next of kin ( for out-of-town numbers , include area codes ) Your children 's schools Household Electric company Gas company Water company Furnace company Plumber Building superintendent Service station or garage Locksmith Taxi ( One that provides service on call ) In case of emergency , this sort of list can save all kinds of confusion and trouble and is invaluable should someone else have to make telephone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value and can be a dangerous waste of time if it is not accurate . Revise and up-date it whenever necessary . Keep it in a clear plastic envelope , which can be bought at the dime store , and post it near your telephone . Nail it , glue it or rivet it in place , for a list like this has a way of wandering off , if it is not fastened down . Also , make duplicates ? one to keep in your office and one for your husband to have . A well-organized family medical kit is also a necessity . You can buy emergency kits already made up , or you can provide for a useful and probably more practical one by  | equipping it yourself . A tackle or tool box makes a sturdy and roomy container . A rather complete family medical kit ought to contain : An almanac of first-aid directions ( one you have read through several times so that you are at least familiar with its con-tents ) Absorbent cotton Ammonia Aspirin Adhesive tape Rubbing alcohol Sterile bandages ( various sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sling ) Sterile compresses Eye dropper and eye cup Epsom salts Flashlight Ipecac ( syrup , to induce vomiting ) Graduated medicine measure Iodine Mild soap Scissors Safety pins Teaspoon Tweezers Vaseline Thermometer Other larger items , such as an electric pad , enema bag , hotwater bottle and ice bag , should be kept in a specific place so that they can be found quickly when needed . Do not confuse your family medical kit with the sort of bandaid and Mercurochrome kits that are handy for treating scrapes and scratches . The latter kits can be kept for every-day ( or what can seem like every-day ) use . Your family medical kit , however , is for illness and emergencies only . It should be kept in one particular place where you can put your hands on it , day or night . It should go along  | with you on trips . You might wish to have a duplicate one to keep in your car . If so , add extra batteries for the flashlight , but do not make your family medical kit into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Have another kit for that . Your family medical kit is equipped to treat humans , not cars , and you will ruin part of its usefulness if you must rummage through a box full of other equipment to find the medical aids you need . These three measures ? keeping in , touch , having an emergency list , and equipping a family medical kit ? will give you a great deal more security when you are away from your home than aimless worry can offer you . You may never need to use the list or the kit , but statistically there is good reason for having them . Accidents are the leading cause of death among children under fourteen ; most of the accidental deaths involving children under five occur in the home . Most accidents can be avoided . You should take a cold , objective look at your child 's surroundings to spot safety hazards and eliminate them . You do not have to become a safety " nut , " but you should play safe . For example , do you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter ? Drugs cause most child poisonings , and aspirin is the largest single cause of child poisonings . Do you keep a can of lye or a bottle of turpentine under the kitchen sink ? It is an easy place for your two-year-old to explore . The number of deaths from poisoning among children is a terrifying statistic . Young children , especially toddlers , are particularly endangered because they are tempted to eat or drink almost anything . Certainly the public is warned often enough about the hazards of carelessly stored medicines , cleaning fluids , pesticides , and still the deaths occur . A working mother has good motivation to see that such stupid , needless accidents do not happen to her child . She  | can limit the number of chemicals of any kind that she keeps on hand by disposing of old medicines , buying only the absolutely necessary pesticides and cleaning aids and keeping all of them stored safely out of the reach of children . Be particularly careful if your child is one of those intrepid adventurers who piles stools on top of benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the unreachable cupboard . If you have that kind of climber in your midst , then you must take whatever extraordinary precautions are needed ? including lock and key ? to keep him out of potential poisons . Even though your toddler may not be the " into-everything " type , do not make the mistake of leaving medicines , household chemicals and other hazardous materials carelessly about . He may one day decide that he wants to see what the top of the kitchen counter looks like and to find out what your medicine tastes like . Plastic caps can seal off electric wall sockets from a child 's poking and probing . Sturdy window guards are a must for every window above the first floor that your child might be able to get to . Such guards should be rechecked regularly , especially after the windows have been washed , to see that they are still secure . You may not be able to eliminate every last possibility of an accident happening , but surely you can eliminate the predictable ones . You must also educate yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accidents . You should also see that the person who cares for your child while you are away knows how to act sensibly in case of emergency . For example , do you know that while it is important to induce vomiting at once in many instances , it can be dangerous in other cases ? Would it occur to you to see that the box or bottle that contained the poison is taken along on the dash for help so the medical experts will know exactly what they are dealing with , or would you wind up at the hospital not  | knowing what your child drank , and can say only that it was " some kind of roach killer ? " Do you find out from your doctor the name of the drug he prescribes and write it on the prescription label so that , in case your child swallowed it , you would know more than that it was something " the doctor gave me for my nerves " ? Fire claims the lives of many children . Have you ever discussed with your children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you know what they should do ? Do not pass on what you think is good advice . Do you know that the actual flames might not be the major danger in a fire ? Smoke and toxic gases can make every second without fresh air critical and a rush through a smoke-filled hallway may be the worst possible choice for an escape route . Find out what safety experts advise , and teach these facts to your children . The American Medical Association publishes a small First Aid Manual , which can be obtained for fifteen cents by writing to the American Medical Association , Order Unit , 535 Dearborn St. , Chicago , Ill. 60610 . If the manual is kept where you can find it when you need it , and if you are already familiar with its contents , you can save the minutes that may mean life and death when speed is essential and mistakes costly . The National Safety Council 's booklet , Family Emergency Almanac , should also be required reading for every family member . The almanac is a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family activities and risk situations faced by families . It can be used as the basis of hazard hunts through the house and for family discussion of accident prevention . It should be read thoroughly by you and your husband and by the person caring for your child . To obtain a copy of the Almanac , write to  | the National Safety Council , 425 North Michigan Ave. , Chicago , Ill. , 60611 . Ask for Family Emergency Almanac , stock number 599.66 . The cost is twenty-five cents . The Children 's Hospital Medical Center of Boston also publishes a booklet , The Accident Handbook ; A New Approach to Children 's Safety , which is worth getting and studying . The handbook outlines frequent causes of accidents and gives rules for their prevention . Also included is the correct emergency first-aid treatment for burns , cuts , fractures , poisonings and other types of accidents . Copies of the handbook can be obtained by sending twenty-five cents ( in coin ) to Health Education Department ? HRW , The Children 's Hospital Medical Center , 300 Longwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publishes a pamphlet , How to Prevent Childhood Poisoning ( ten cents per copy ) , which can be of help to you as you poison-proof your house . What about the dangers away from home ? Suppose your child is old enough now to make his way to and from school on public transportation ? Has he been properly educated on traffic safety , behavior on the bus or subway , how to deal with approaches from strangers ? By the time you finish thinking about all of these precautions and the reasons for them , you may be a quivering , shaking wreck yourself , and may not be inclined to fill your child with so many fears . No one would recommend that you wait for a long rainy afternoon to sit your child down and then unload on him all the things you think he should know about a world full of unspeakable dangers . Safety facts can be taught and explained in small , matterof-fact doses that he will be able to manage . You would find it flagrantly faulty reasoning for a school not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | children . You will be equally remiss if you do not teach safety at home . It is only fair that your child know about his world and how to survive in it as well as enjoy it . For the mother who works , the times when her child is ill easily qualify as the times when the outside job seems least rewarding and not worth it all . There will be occasions when your child is sick but not seriously ill . You may decide that you can safely go to work , but your heart may go right on telling you that you should be at home . You can remind yourself , " Nonsense . He is being cared for ; he is perfectly all right , " but sometimes the tugging does n't go away . For the mother who must work , who must protect her earning power , who must save any extra time taken from work for real emergencies , these are the times of greatest sacrifice . Although preventive medicine has done much to make the ordinary illnesses of childhood relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still be those occasions when your child may run an alarmingly high fever or waken in the morning with a strange , frightening lassitude that tells you clearly that something is wrong . At such times , you respond to the needs of the child , whatever they are , and arrangements are made as best they can be for any other commitments you may have . That your presence at home is needed during times of crises should not be difficult for any employer or client to accept . Otherwise , you have little choice but to seek a new employer or a new client . The obviously sick child , then , does not present the dilemma about work that a mildly ailing youngster might . No matter how good the medical care you provide for your child , you can be certain that he will acquire his share of colds , assorted aches and pains , and the " virus that is going around . " When such ailments are mixed in with an oc-  | casional bout of " school fever " and " sympathetic sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not you should go to work and leave the baby with your helper or send the older child off to nursery or school . Whichever way you decide , you are never sure whether you are being overa.Ixious or too casual . What do you do when your baby seems fretful but has less than half a degree of fever ? Is she just teething ? Beginning a cold ? Or is it the start of a painful ear infection ? How about the child with a faint , mysterious rash and no other symptoms ? It might be an allergy or a heat rash , but he seems a bit droopy too . Suppose Johnny wakes early and complains of not feeling well . His " I do n't feel good " may be accompanied by no fever , no runny nose , no sore throat , only a general malaise , real or feigned . Is the child really sick or does he not want to go to school today ? Or does he want attention ? The latter ailments may be problems worth looking into , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It is 7 A.M. If you call the doctor , what do you have to report ? On the basis of any of the above symptoms , he will likely tell you any or all of the following : give the child aspirin and keep him in bed ; watch him and report if other symptoms develop ; bring him in during office hours later in the morning . He may also let you know , though perhaps less specifically , that he resents receiving nonemcrgcncy calls at daybreak ; that he is a medical doctor and does not give psychiatric counseling to overanxious , guilt-ridden working mothers . There is only the remotest likelihood that he will tell you that he will come by to check the child . The doctor who has either the time or the willingness to make house calls is rapidly disappearing . If your only hesitation about calling a doctor is that you do not wish to disturb him , then call him . Doctors are paid  | well for their services , and if you can not call without feeling you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your calls . Ask the doctor what arrangements he has for handling calls outside regular office hours . Can he be reached on weekends , or early mornings or late at night ? Does he have another doctor with whom he trades so that one of them can always be reached ? You ought to be able to reach your doctor or his substitute through some arrangement other than his own convenience . Though many mothers , working or not , may drive their pediatricians crazy with calls that the doctors feel are unnecessary , an anxious mother , particularly with a first baby , is not necessarily neurotic because she calls a doctor to report vague symptoms . The doctor may have had a thousand such calls ; it may be the mother 's first look at a heat rash . She may be totally inexperienced and untrained in baby and child care , but she usually learns fast . In any event , as doctors are quick to point out , a layman is often not qualified to determine medical necessities . If you are torn between the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or being lectured severely for not seeking treatment earlier , choose the former . You have to be reasonable about your calls to the doctor , though , and objective about your own motives . You do not call the doctor simply because you want him to tell you that the symptoms are not serious and that it is all right for you to go on to work . That is for you to decide . You may have an appointment in your work world which you would cancel or postpone if necessary , but would prefer to keep if you could . What do you do ? No one else can tell you , and you should not expect it ? not even from the doctor . He may or may not be able to diagnose your child 's condition , but he certainly can not tell you whether to go  | on to work or not . Decisions of this sort must be made on your own ; even your husband , much as he might wish to do so , can not resolve such conflicts for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to escape them . You will have to try to be objective and honest about each situation , and if you make mistakes , make them on the side of caring for the child . If you cancel your appointment at work to stay home , you not only can care for your child but you also eliminate your worry over the decision . If your youngster turns out to be not sick at all , you may still , by your presence , have given him the proper medicine . It may have been a far better prescription for him than if you went to work and tried to make it up to him later . Even if it turns out reasonably certain that he only wanted to stay home , a child healthy in other respects will find that it is not all that much fun to be confined to bed for illness when he really is n't sick . Fortunately , after the age of five , the number and duration of illnesses among children decline substantially , which is one of the reasons many mothers wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs , until their children have reached school age .  | I 'M TIRED ALL THE TIME If anyone has a right to claim fatigue , it is the working mother . But the truth is , she is probably not tired all the time ? or at least she need not be . Chronic fatigue is seldom caused by physical overexertion . The way we live today does not require an energy output that would make us physically tired . Women with office jobs are far less active than their sister stay-at-homes , and the professional woman is usually doing the least strenuous work of all . Yet , fatigue is one of the complaints that doctors hear most often , regardless of the woman 's job .. ( Women who are on their feet for a good part of the day-women in sales , nursing , line work ? can present the doctors with a pretty good case for being tired . Just the battle of getting home from work in the rush hour , hanging on to a handrail on the bus or subway all the way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are n't the causes of chronic fatigue . This is the kind of " tired " that calls for kicking off your shoes and putting  | your feet up for a while . Ah ? h ? h , that feels wonderful ! ) If you find yourself feeling " tired all the time , " a physical examination , is , of course , a must . If nothing is organically wrong ? and the chances are that is the way it will turn out ? you must try to determine what is causing the fatigue ; then you will have a chance of coping with it . A woman may mistakenly believe that if she could just get more rest she would not be so tired . She feels that the eight hours she spends working away from home each day are exhausting . She tells herself that she has worked enough and consequently should get all the extra rest she can on evenings and weekends . But if there is nothing physically wrong with her , extra rest will do nothing to eliminate chronic fatigue . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bender , or a late sleepin on a once-in-a-while Saturday morning , but , as a routine , extra rest is not the answer to chronic fatigue . Lethargy builds lethargy . Many always-tired people get too much rest . They may be conditioned from childhood on the importance of getting plenty of sleep , but people differ in their needs for rest and you may not require as much as you think you do . It may be that more and regular physical activity could increase your vitality . Let your body tell you when it is tired ? do n't let your mind dictate it . Feeling tired and being tired are not the same thing . You may feel tired long before you have a start on actually being tired . Perhaps things are disorganized at home , you have little or no routine , your work piles up and you literally never know where to begin . One way to keep from facing such a frustrating situation is to say or think you are " too tired . " Or you may commit yourself to social activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using up twice as much energy in your so-called leisure time as you do in your work ? at parties you do n't really enjoy ; people you do n't really  | relate to . You can wear yourself out thinking of ways to wriggle out of commitments you make and later regret , instead of facing up to honest ways of avoiding them in the first place or forthrightly eliminating them . Or perhaps one of the children is doing poorly in school . You worry about it a lot , but you are either not able to put into action a corrective program of any kind or you neglect to do so . Your problems could be much more serious than these or much more trivial , but when they involve mental attitudes that produce pressure , frustration and anxiety , you can be sure that they will also produce fatigue . Such emotions are major causes of chronic fatigue , yet they have nothing to do with physical exertion , and they can not be banished simply by res4They can rob you of vitality before you have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the thought of work to be done , and not the work itself that makes you tired . That is often the reason for that tired old complaint , " I was tired before I got up . " The poor woman who says this kind of thing has already let her mind and emotions talk her into being tired , and consequently she will not get much of anything done that day . Should you find yourself indulging in such worn-out thinking , consider the following check-list . Do you have a routine for the daily repetitive tasks ? the bedmaking and dishes routine ? so that you know where to start without even having to think about it ? Are you keeping daily lists of things to be done and planning a day you can handle ? Or are you simply taking on whatever job you happen to stumble on , meanwhile seeing every single tree in the forest that still has to be cut ? Just before going to sleep at night , use your subconscious to help you handle the daily part of living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the things on your list for tomorrow . ( You have already limited the list to as much as  | you can expect to accomplish and no more . ) You 'll call for the doctor 's checkup for the baby , see the building super about the leaky faucets , stop by the library on your way home for Joe , clean the refrigerator while Anne helps you with the dishes , work on the laundry for an hour while the children do homework . As this practice of anticipating your day becomes a habit , you will find that when unexpected things come up , and they will more times than not , you will either handle or postpone them much more calmly when you know what other demands already have to be met . Knowing specifically what you have to do can protect you from taking on too much and then becoming overwhelmed by it all . It is easier to decline further obligations when you know you are already at the limit than when you have no idea at what point you will reach the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedules , are they realistic ? You can not squeeze twenty-eight hours into twenty-four . You must have a day that you can get through at something less than a breakneck pace so that you are not constantly rushing , rushing in a losing race against the clock . If you always seem to have more listed than you can get done , then you have either got to become more efficient or something has got to go . It is not as difficult to decide what should go as you might think . The essentials separate from the nonessentials rather easily when you 're desperate . That Saturday dinner party may be just the thing to eliminate in order to cut your list and your life down to size . Is the dinner party essential ? Is it really essential ? Will there be any moral , legal , psychic damage done if the Saturday party goes off the list ? No ? Then , off with it . Do not trap yourself with such foolish statements as " I owe a dinner party " or " I 'm expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , stop going to other people 's parties and you wo n't have the problem any more . If it bothers your  | friends , they will stop inviting you and you wo n't have the problem any more . You wo n't wind up friendless , either . You will wind up with friends who have similar problems of limited time , or who appreciate the particular predicament of working mothers , or who are generous enough not to keep score on " who owes whom . " You can also learn ways to maintain friendships on scraps of time here and there . You manage this by a short telephone call for no reason but that it 's convenient then and not sometime later , by sending a card or a note now and then , by changing your entertainment patterns . You might arrange to meet friends in town for dinner rather than do the bulk of your entertaining at home ; or you might serve late breakfast at home on Sunday . Also , learn to issue spur-of-the-moment invitations for home entertaining on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is straightened up , the children occupied , and you and your husband in the mood for company . Ask some friends to share your late-offered but heartfelt hospitality . If they can accept , fine ; if not , no harm done . ( Such spur-of-themoment invitations ought to be received by working mothers in the same spirit they are offered ; if you ca n't accept , you are certainly free to say so . ) If you are really tired , you will find lots of activities that are not essential ? you simply measure them against how tired you think you are . You will probably find that many of the most tiring activities are tied pretty closely to ideas of what other people will think . You can not be all things to all people , and if you are already doing a reasonably good job of pleasing your husband , your children and your employer , it is asking a bit much of yourself to please all kinds of other people , too , by taking on additional and nonessential responsibilities . When you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential than the others , chop it  | off . That one simple act can often result in a blessed surge of energy merely by removing the pressure . If you work full time , you have already put in a long , long day by the time you get home , and yet your day with the family is just beginning . Now is the time when the most energy and effort of the whole day are required of you . The children will need a chunk of your attention when you may least feel like giving it . They may have homework , school projects , problems , questions , and " Hey , Mom , you know what ? " followed by a five-minute monologue about " this guy in my classroom , you know , we were playing kickball , you know , and this guy . . . " You can listen , really listen , or you can " umh . . . uh ... umh ... " while your mind is on all the work that you have to get done . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think that 's fair , Mom ? " and you have to say , " What ? I 'm sorry , Hank , I was n't listening ... " you 'll be just as tired as before ? maybe a bit more , because you know he wanted you to listen and you did n't . You also know that he 'll be a little less enthusiastic in the second telling , if indeed he bothers at all . The kind and thoughtful gesture of listening to your children will not tire you if you really listen to them . You will find yourself far more refreshed if you give your attention fully and generously for the few minutes it takes to hear a child out on those occasions when he very much wants to tell you something . The things you do n't do that you feel you should do are the most fatiguing jobs of all , so do n't slip into the tiring habit of saying , " Not now , I ca n't listen , I 'm too tired . " A lot of working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to home . You walk in the door after a day at work , and it 's like starting right in on another full work day . Only , now you are not among your working peers who  | see you as an individual but among your children and husband who may count your value in far more treasured but also in far more taken-for-granted ways sometimes . It can be irritating and tiring to have to deal with demands on the home front before you have even made a safe reentry . So you flop in a chair , kick off your shoes , and think to yourself , " I 'm too tired to move . " Here are a few tips : Do n't flop until you have given your family at least the chance to say hello to you and a few minutes of conversation if they want it . The first few minutes of the reentry are the critical ones , so hang on at least that long . When you flop , pick a place out of the line of fire . Seclude yourself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoes and stockings . Small fry may trail you to relate the big news of the day . That will not interfere with stretching and relaxing while you listen . Then , it is " everybody out , " while you change clothes ? from working woman to keeperof-the-nest . With each role goes a different set of costumes . A quick shower is a good pick-me-up for many people . In the process you can do plenty of stretching and relaxing , too . Before you dress again , sit and let your head droop over and your whole body go limp . Then rotate your head slowly all the way around . This is probably the best exercise in the world for worn-out working mothers , for while it relaxes the body it also seems to clear the mind , something in the manner of a sweep hand on a clock , as your head rotates . You can feel the tensions of your work day being erased as you move your head slowly around . Make two or three rotations , and you are ready for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the time being , your job day ? whether good or bad . Later on , after the flurry of family activities are over and you are settled ? mentally  | as well as physically ? in the home atmosphere , you can share what seems important from your job on a much more confident basis . When you are ready to dress , do not get into a housecoat , robe or lounging attire . These are designed for leisure , and unless you are ready to loaf , do not put them on . They will simply slow you down . Instead , put on active clothes ? a dress , or skirt and blouse , if you prefer , or shorts and sneakers if they give you a " go " feeling . By all means have clothes for home work that are trim , clean and well fitting . Many women find that if they are in a loose-fitting dress or other lounge wear , they do not zip around and get as much done as they would like ; they feel at loose ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted ? a dress with a beltline or shorts or slacks ? and they are ready to go . Your clothes for home should be clothes you like ? in your favorite colors and styles that you think you look well in . Such clothes can give you an enormous psychological boost and are truly as important as the clothes you wear to your job . Change your workday make-up too . If your skin can stand it , give your face a good lathering with a facial soap ; otherwise , a thorough cleaning with a cleansing cream . You are changing both costume and cosmetics for another role and you should be as carefully groomed for your home work as for your business . Going at your housework with more physical involvement can also help relieve emotional tension . Make your choice of housework as active as possible when you are tense or worried ; leave the sewing and the menus for another time . It can sometimes be extremely difficult to let go of something you have been worrying ' round and ' round in your head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are likely to install it there all the more firmly . Better to slip in another thought to compete with the worry .  | Tie it to a physical task and the worry will recede , giving your mind time to turn off and rest for a while . You do n't have to jog in place at the ironing board , but you can suck in your stomach and stand up straight ( poor posture itself . can make you feel tired ) . Switch your schedules around , and take on jobs where you will be swinging a mop or washing windows . The physical activity will help you , and if you concentrate on the job at hand , you can rest your overworked brain while you see just how shiny you can get the floor . No one wants to make a career out of shiny kitchen floors , but on occasion they can be just plain good therapy . It beats having to weave baskets . Outdoor exercise is an especially good antidote when worry , anger or other debilitating emotions leave you wornout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , is to look for your nearest available child and watch his enthusiasm when you say , " Come with me and let 's go off for a little walk . " Just once around the block , and your spirits will be up and fatigue on the way out . The favored child will be charmed by the time alone with you . You are safer taking just one child along at a time when you are wrestling with an emotional problem . With more than one youngster , you cut the odds that your outing will be totally peaceful when you need it most . The chatter of a single child when he has a parent 's ears to himself can serve as a reassuring steady rhythm to an adult mind in turmoil , while the content of his monologue often contains a perspective that refreshes an older , wearier mind . Though it is hard to imagine a working mother having time to be bored , it can happen . And boredom can cause fatigue . If you are bored at work , change your job or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier of the two to accomplish . ) Do not waste your energy on a job that is boring to you if you can find another or  | train for another that is not . If housework bores you , it might be that you do not know enough about it . Get books on the subject . You could never be bored with cooking once you know enough about it to be a really good cook . You can not actually be bored with cleaning once you set up a schedule and know the really efficient ways to get the jobs done . While you are working , rest periods are important and they should be planned for . The more difficult , boring and unpleasant the job , the greater the need to break it up with small rewards . Just a feet-up coffee break , halfway through a major closet cleaning helps , and if it is a really awful job , take two or three stops . Do one-fourth of the job and then stop and treat yourself . A phone call for five minutes of gabbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look through one of the new magazines can help you wind up far less tired when the job is done than if you had slogged straight through and finished fifteen minutes earlier ? which you probably would not have anyway , since efficiency declines rapidly as fatigue increases . Also , learn to relax in places where nothing else can be done . Many people think that being efficient means rush , rush , rush , when just the opposite is true . People who rush all the time are not efficient or they would not be rushing . They dash furiously from one thing to another , but when they find themselves with empty time , they may actually become tense and uncomfortable . Instead , accustom yourself to an even pace that allows you to make even odd moments relaxing . You can turn the small irritations of daily living to your advantage by training yourself to think " Relax . " Try it in the car at a busy intersection while waiting fol. a stop light to change . Why not ? You can have up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . Instead of tensing up wondering if the light will ever  | turn green , you can think " Relax . " Breathe deeply , stretch hard , go limp and relax . All you will risk is a toot from the car behind or the man driver next to you shaking his head over another goofy woman driver . Tired all the time ? That may be only what you think .  | MY HUSBAND IS VERY UNDERSTANDING That husbands of working women can be understanding , pleasant , thoughtful and hard-working human beings is beyond dispute . That they can be cantankerous , obstinate , proud and lazy is also a matter of common knowledge . Husbands of working wives are , in short , much like husbands of women who do not work . Society , however , views the husbands of working wives somewhat differently : They are Mr. Milk-toast , who would not dare object to a working wife or to anything else for that matter ; Mr. Put-Upon , whose virility goes down the drain the first time he helps with the breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his wife 's successful career ; and Mr. Overcompensating , who drives himself unmercifully so that his wife will not outshine him . Among husbands of would-be working wives , you can find : Mr. Domineering , who " forbids " his wife to work ; Mr. Protective , who would not think of " letting " his  | wife work ; and Mr. Master-of-the-House , who can tell you ? and frequently does ? that a woman 's place is in the home . Supporting players in the great " wives-should-work ; wives-should-not-work " debate include Mrs. Domineering , the ambitious career woman , who suffers from myopia when it comes to dirty dishes in the sink ; and Mrs. Out-of-It , the devoted little housewife , who thinks that Kafka is a brand of coffee . These stereotyped menaces to marriage can be a real burden to the working wife , and to the husband of the working wife , who try to live them down . While some men may still consider cleaning , cooking and rearing children exclusively a woman 's world , a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and home with a woman who works but to help her with the home work too . They do not fear any threat to their manhood , nor any blow to their pride as family provider . If the woman has a good marriage going for her , the chances are that her husband understands her wish to work and the reasons for it and will view her job as a reasonable extension of a woman 's life . If the wife values such a partnership , she will show a similar consideration for her partner 's well-being and happiness , which is mainly what love and marriage are all about anyway ( However , even when their husbands accept their working as reasonable and normal , many working wives are not interested in escaping their domestic responsibilities but take a great deal of pride in their homes and children and enjoy the femininity attached to being mistress of a well-kept household . Some husbands , of course , do not favor their wives ' working , but they are probably a vanishing breed . It is becoming increasingly acceptable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful at her job but even to be married to one . It is no longer automatically accepted that such men  | are neglected , resentful , less virile or less the master of their own homes . Should your husband seem quite content that you are happy in your work , be thankful and do n't waste any time wondering or worrying about why he does n't object to your working . He can love you without proving to the world that he also dominates you . The woman today who says , " My husband will not allow me to work " may well be reporting how she hopes he feels . Some women have n't the least desire to work , but unaccountably feel inferior about it . There are some general rules for considerate behavior which working wives can follow to the profit of their marriage . They are based on two important assumptions : that you value your marriage and want to hang on to it , and that you treasure your husband and do not want to shortchange him or hurt him . L Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return home from work with griping or grouching about problems that exist either at work or at home , Do not walk in the front door and unburden yourself about the latest office treachery going on behind your back or the outrageous favoritism being shown to a new little snip who has been with the firm only six weeks . Do not unreel your indignation about some breakdown in home routine : " You should not have told the children they could go to the playground this late ; it 's too close to dinner . " If you are looking for the best possible time to start a fight with the least possible provocation , the moment you arrive home should suit you best . You are tired and hungry ; so is your husband ; the children are hungry , at the very least , and possibly tired too . It will take very little to get an argument boiling . By timing such full-blown fights to coincide with your arrival home from work , you can also practically guarantee resentment of your work by an angered  | husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become a giant-sized grudge , and the " If it were n't for that job of yours " enters the family list of stock fighting phrases . Avoid rush-hour arguments in the morning , too . Such eye-openers as " How do you expect me to teach the children to hang up their clothes if you do n't hang up yours ? " and " I wish you would shave earlier so the children can get in the bathroom " can be downright dangerous , particularly if he still has hold of the razor . Give yourself and your husband at least a chance to fully waken and have a cup of coffee before firing off any volleys . You can set out for the day at work in a sad or sour frame of mind after an early morning skirmish that you do not even have time to finish . Your husband wo n't feel any better than you do , either . When can you fight , then , if it is a bad time after work , a bad time before work , and everyone knows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , especially just before you go to sleep ? Every married couple has a right to an argument once in a while ? even couples that include working wives . Actually , any time is all right for a fight , providing it is not triggered by factors that have nothing to do with the main battle . The point is that if you avoid fights that are caused not so much by what you say as by when you say it ( when you and your husband are tired and hungry , for instance ) , you may not have a fight at all over the particular subject . What might have become a no-holds-barred affair may instead turn out to be only a mild disagreement . Given a reasonable sense of humor , you may actually enjoy a gentle teasing over that little snip at the office or an indulgent smile over the children 's eagerness to try their new kite in the park . Other good fighting guidelines include settling the argument at one encounter . Either declare a truce or declare a  | winner , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day or days . The wasted energy and emotion caused by prolonging the misery of a fight is a terrible misuse of precious time . Though you go on to work and are out of the house so that you ca n't go fall on the bed and cry until noon , your work will hardly profit from emotions simmering underneath all day . While you may not have as much time to think up new ammunition to use in the battle if your mind is occupied all day , your homecoming may be enough to stir things up again . If you can not simply " forget and forgive , " then settle the disagreement rather than pout or seethe about it for days . Do n't let your husband get away with pouting or gnashing his teeth , either ; a confrontation in marriage is preferable to a prolonged cold war . Rule Number Two states : If you work because you must help support the family , you have a special obligation to your husband if you value his own sense of pride . You can not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapon for forcing him to do what he would not otherwise do willingly . ' Although it is only reasonable to expect that your husband will carry his share of the work responsibilities related to the house and family , you must also be reasonable in your view of what that " share " is and what price you are willing to pay to obtain it . If you must work in order to send the children to college , do you pay your husband back for this injustice by demanding that he clean the house or cook the meals or do the dishes ? Do you tell him that you have " worked all day to help support this family " and are not going to work all night , too , to keep the house cleaned up ? Not if you value male self-esteem , you do not . You can expect your husband to help you , you can ask him to help you ? both with possibilities of success . You will seldom be successful by demanding  | that he help you while undermining whatever pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family . No reasonable person would deliberately set out to destroy the self-esteem of another human being , whether husband , child , friend or stranger ; still , that is what a woman does when she lets her husband know that she does not consider him an adequate provider . Just as the most telling method of attacking a woman 's femininity is to label her as domineering , a cruel blow can be dealt a man by proving him unequal to a traditional role in family life . This is how working wives may collect the charge of emasculating their husbands . It is not their intended goal ; they believe their aim is the just sharing of responsibilities . It is their method and not the goal that would fairly earn them the label . Rule Number Three : When a woman is in direct competition with her husband as provider for the family , she is stupid indeed if she does not try her best to resist the temptation to boss him in other areas of life . If she tells him how to handle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unilateral decisions on family life , schedules his time with little or no consultation , adjusts her sex life to suit her own desire , she is a domineering , selfish female That such women exist in American society is indisputable ; that there is little excuse for them is undeniable . It should be a comforting thought to working women , however , that such females can be found at home ruling over their domains as well as in the office running things from a forward command post . Some men , of course , do not seem to mind their wives running their lives for them ; it may well be that they are quite happy and content with such an arrangement . For the woman who has a tendency to dominate and a husband who resents it , however , the fact that she has a job may accentuate these differences . If the woman really  | does not want to dominate and her husband has no intention of becoming submissive , there is not much likelihood of trouble . A good recipe for any working wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fewer You should 's . Allow the father the opportunity to discipline his children , the chance to decide on family activities and purchases , the time to answer the children 's questions before you do . With such a formula , there should be little to fear from " role reversal , " " identity crises , " or " vacated virility . " Rule Number Four : Do not win your husband 's approval for taking a job by promising him that " it will not make any difference at home . " There are bound to be differences at home , including some differences in his own life . It is better that you do not try to work , than to work and try not to make any ripples at home . lThere will occasionally be waves of one kind or another when you have an outside job , and ripples almost all the time . It is hopeless to assure your husband that there will be no difference in the way you run the house or care for the children or look after him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can have time to get dressed for work ; the dinner hour may have to be changed ; you may need more help from the children and more from your husband , at least to the extent that he goes along with necessary changes . It is far better to be realistic about the changes your job may make than to try to care for home , family and job without any changes . By attempting to do the impossible , you only fashion your own martyrdom and provide ample foundation for your husband 's complete abdication of his own responsibilities to wife , children and home . Rule Number Five : Do not let the business of setting schedules , supervising children , planning menus , and arranging activities swamp you so that your husband winds up as last priority ; Children , when it suits them , will monop-  | olize as much of your time as they can get and you will permit . You can go overboard in devoting time to them because you work . Save some time for companionship with your husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been put to bed or have retired for the night . There may be times in the family 's life cycle when there is little time for the two of you to be together at home or for social activities away from home . One piece of advice that falls forlornly on many a woman 's ears goes something like this : " You and your husband should go off by yourselves once in a while ? get away for a few days alone . " The women who are able to take such advice usually do not need it . They have the money , the time and the trusted , dependable child care that can make such idyllic occasions possible . There might be some women who would not think of " leaving the children , " even under such ideal conditions , but it would take more than a weekend away with their husbands to cure their troubles anyway . Most women would jump at the chance to devote a few days exclusively to being a wife . Assuming that time and money problems can be overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfactory care for the children may often prove insurmountable . Such suggestions as asking relatives to stay or trading off baby-sitting duty with another couple may simply not be possible ? even for only an overnight weekend close by . Still , it is important to have time to share with your husband alone ? not counting the ordinary social functions where you may see little of each other between the times you arrive and depart . Whether or not you can arrange time away from home or manage an evening social life alone together , weekday lunch hours make good times for dates with your husband . If you work within reasonable distance of each other , a  | special lunch date can provide the kind of oasis from the rest of your responsibilities that many couples need and savor . A long lunch hour or perhaps even a matinee can be a splendid refreshment requiring a minimum of arrangements . No worry or added expense in lining up a babysitter , no bother with special dress ? only a little extra time off from work , plans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled at the last minute without a great deal of inconvenience either way ? a lunch date has a lot to offer a working mother who wants to get out alone with her husband once in a while . f Rule Number Six : Reflect often to yourself that if you and your husband have a happy marriage you do not have to prove it to anybody else . Do not waste your time trying to demonstrate to others that your husband is not neglected , resentful or put upon . Such efforts seldom come off as real , anyway . Women may parade and protest and pout about equal rights , but equality with men is impossible , and superiority to them unthinkable , in a marriage relationship . Females may compete vigorously for equality in the business world and with good cause , but few women in their right minds would wish to change the traditional role of the male in the marriage relationship . They are quite content to have their destiny in this department ordained by their anatomy . The debate is mostly a needless one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of room for excelling without totally dominating the relationship . Yet , when a woman becomes an outstanding success in her work world , it takes a man of exceptional security to weather society 's view that his wife outshines him . It helps if he has a wife with perceptiveness and grace and a healthy disregard for society 's stereotyped views of male dominance . Society can not follow the couple into  | their home and bedroom to view the happiness and contentment and security they give each other . Society ? neighbor , friend , relative ? does not really know who is the dominant one . It might well be the man who is often viewed with the merest trace of amused pity by his associates . A wife can strengthen her " healthy disregard for society 's stereotyped views " by clearing her life of those who parrot such views . They can be destructive of your ego and demoralizing to your marriage . Tiptoe quietly around people who saw away on your personal life unless or until you can manage their presence with equanimity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work if it pleases him , but do not expect a corresponding interest in yours . No matter how exciting your job , if you value your husband , his work comes first . Assuming he is a reasonably considerate person , he will seldom , if ever , put you to such an either/or choice . If you are a smart , considerate person , you will seldom , if ever , make it necessary for him to do so . What about his work ? Will your work interests conflict with his ? Will you need to entertain your husband 's business associates or at least appear socially with your husband at various business functions ? Does your own job involve entertaining , too , or business meetings and social functions that must be attended ? It might not be often that you will have to make the choice , but should it be necessary you will have little trouble deciding between the two if you weight the scales to your husband 's advantage and then let him decide . When you do accompany your husband to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in your own work and refrain from sharing your glory with all who will listen . The people who are involved in your husband 's business life are interested primarily in their own
