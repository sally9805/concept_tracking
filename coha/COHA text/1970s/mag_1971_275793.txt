Vice President Spiro Agnew packed up his clubs , bade farewell to Fellow Golfer Bob Hope in Palm Springs , and embarked upon an official good-will tour of Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . In all , he will be out of the country for 32 days , longer than any Vice President since Richard Nixon . <P> The ten nations Agnew will visit during the trip abroad , his third since taking office , have , in the main , authoritarian governments . Most have no pressing problems with the U.S. , or great influence in matters of international urgency . Only in South Korea , his first official stop , where Agnew last week represented President Nixon at the third inauguration of President Chung Hee Park , was there even notable ceremonial justification for his presence . <P> There are U.S.-Korean problems - withdrawal of U.S. troops and possible U.S. import quotas on Korean textiles , among others . But Agnew steered clear of any substantive discussions with President Park . <P> Otherwise , conceded one Agnew aide : " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a separate rationale for each of the countries . " <P> Agnew provided some stop-by-stop rationales of stunning inconsequentiality : SPAIN . " The Spanish stop comes about as a result of Prince Juan Carlos visiting the last space shot and conversations we had there . " ETHIOPIA . " Haile Selassie was in the U.S. recently . Again , this was his express wish that we visit there ; we had an invitation on that one . " KENYA . " There 's not any particular problem there , but I do n't believe there have been any American visitors in Nairobi in some time . " <P> KUWAIT . " I do n't think Kuwait has had a high-level American visitor for some time ; they had been asking for one . " SAUDI ARABIA . " Of course my visit there comes as a result of the recent visit of King Faisal to Washington . I happened to be sitting next to Faisal at a luncheon at the White House , and he evidenced an interest in having me visit his country if I found it convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carrying a message of good will as well as an " explanation of the Nixon foreign policy . " That should leave ample time for golf : enroute to South Korea , Agnew toured the course in Guam . He plans a " logistics " stay in Singapore , whose Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is an ardent golfer . <P> What then , is the Vice President-or the President-up to ? One speculation is that the trip is a graceful easing out of Agnew , that Nixon may be giving his Vice President a farewell taste of the trappings of glory before bouncing him from the 1972 ticket . Some support can be found for the theory . Secretary of the Treasury John B. Connally Jr . was last week tapped to announce the Administration 's latest economic stance , a clear sign of Presidential favor . <P> More likely , however , the trip is intended to upgrade the Agnew image . After his abrasive appearances on the U.S. banquet circuit , distance may lend Agnew the aura of an American statesman . Then , too , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Summer months are slim ones on the political fund-raising circuit .
