THERE is a kaleidoscopic quality about the events and the trip , " White House Correspondent Jerrold Schecter cabled from Peking last week . " Each moment fixed , then whirling on to a new sensation . This has been a week of sights and sounds . " <P> For Schecter , Washington Bureau Chief Hugh Sidey and TIME-LIFE Photographer John Dominis , capturing the sights and sounds of President Nixon 's visit to China last week meant exhausting 18-hour days of reporting . Each day Sidey and Schecter followed the President and Mrs. Nixon through their busy official schedule . When the First Family paused occasionally to catch its breath , our reporters traveled to Chinese schools , factories and army training fields to capture the quality of life in a country few U.S. journalists have seen in more than two decades . <P> Tracking their every move from over 6,000 miles away was Picture Editor John Durniak . Since the day the Nixon trip was announced , Durniak had been laying plans to get photographs out of China and into this week 's issue . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special airlift to get pictures of the trip off the mainland , and by Thursday night the first 150 rolls of film had been flown into Chicago . There Durniak , Color Director Arnold Drapkin , Artist Anthony Libardi and a crew of photolab technicians worked nonstop for the next 38 hours . Meanwhile TIME writers and editors in New York were poring over the Sidey-Schecter files for this week 's cover story and articles in THE NATION and THE PRESS . The result : a hard-won look into a long-hidden China . <P> <P> The road to this year 's Democratic Convention in Miami could prove to be a bewildering one for voters , with 13 presidential candidates , 24 separate primaries and a variety of electoral reforms along the way . To serve as a campaign trail guide , a special twelve-page supplement , " Primaries ' 72 , " is bound in the center of this week 's TIME . <P> It is the product of many weeks ' work by our correspondents round the country and the staff of the Nation section working under the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The supplement describes the candidates ' styles , strategies and chances of success . It also explains the effect of electoral reforms made in the past four years .
