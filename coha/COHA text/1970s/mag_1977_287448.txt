Like grizzled combat veterans , the survivors of the first day 's run clustered last week at the bar in an Alexandria , Minn. , lodge . Belting down tumblers of Jim Beam and Pabst , they compared horror stories : a burnt-out piston , a broken ski , a torn suspension , a collision with a tree . Their bright thermal suits were splotched with oil , eyes were red from fatigue , and windburned faces were scratched from encounters with barbed wire and flying stones . Some hobbled , others seemed permanently hunched from their battle . The weary combatants had just completed the opening day of one of sport 's most grueling events , the St. Paul Winter Carnival 's 12th International Snowmobile Race-a 576-mile , four-day , open-throttled marathon from St. Paul to Winnipeg , Man . <P> Early that morning the 335 starting drivers had pulled on hockey shin guards , corset-like plastic chest protectors , and all the cold-weather gear they could wear and still waddle to the starting line . Temperatures were in the low 20s , balmy by St. Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be traveling , the wind-chill factor would make it seem like - 20 . Some of the drivers fashioned long tape-and-rubber noses to keep the vapor of their breath from fogging their goggles . Others applied wide strips of tape to their faces to ward off frostbite . Then , setting off in waves of ten , three minutes apart , they were on their way . <P> The arduous route , which led the snowmobilers along busy , narrow roads , through woods and across ditches , quickly took its toll . A light covering of snow was soon worn away by early starters . Coarse , rutted ditches caused spills ; unexpected rocks forced some sleds to veer into guardrails and trees . One driver was hit by a car ; ten others got lost on a lake . At day 's end only 172 contestants remained in the race . <P> Rules limited each driver to two mechanics , who could work on his battered vehicle for just two hours a day . Some drivers carried spare parts in the trunks of cars driven by friends and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were designers and mechanics on call in 40-ft. , parts-stuffed support vans . The difference between the amateurs and the pros was evident in other ways ; the John Deere team , in training for three months , was forbidden the nightly boilermakers and sat off to the side of each stop , drinking ginger ale and plotting strategy . <P> As the race barreled northward toward Canada , the snow grew deeper and the trail became a successive range of steep moguls . In the drifting snow , the racers bobbed and weaved , plunging from view only to emerge again and fly across a farmer 's driveway or a roadside culvert . Occasionally they would tear onto the shoulder of the road , skimming around a car or truck before hurtling back into the ditch . Driving a 450-lb. snowmobile at high speed on rough terrain is like riding a brahma bull-an exercise in keen judgment and balance . As Driver Al Bergquist , an Illinois farmer in his saner moments , told TIME Correspondent Dick Woodbury , " You 're whipping along at 70 m.p.h. and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's there .
