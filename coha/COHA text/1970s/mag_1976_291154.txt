Dawn was breaking over Williamsburg , Va. , as four dozen largely unshaven , unfed and unrested journalists climbed into the Jimmy Carter press bus for the 374th time since the campaign 's formal launching on Labor Day . Over the vehicle 's public address system came the reassuring voice of Gerald Ford : " Hi ! How are you ? Nice to see you . Good morning . Hi ! How are you ? Nice to see you ... " <P> Ford 's repeated greetings , taped earlier at a factory gate by NBC Radio Newsman David Rush , brought tears of laughter to his weary listeners . As the campaign nears its close , strain is beginning to show . Deprived of sleep and laundry service , herded around by Secret Service agents and local police , forced to hear the same basic speech over and over , the boys and girls on the bus are responding with mirth and mischief . <P> When Gerald Ford left Oct. 22 on his grueling twelve-day , 15-state final campaign swing ( the " Bataan death march , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 125 reporters accompanying him had never been within shouting distance of the candidate . They are relegated to a chartered Boeing 707 that flies some miles ahead of Air Force One . At rallies and other public appearances , reporters either watch Ford from roped-in areas some distance away or are kept waiting on the press bus , where they listen to a " pool " reporter 's walkie-talkie account . " We 're trapped in a steel cocoon , " says Larry O'Rourke of the Philadelphia Bulletin . " We 're fed what they want us to know . " <P> To mitigate such dependence-and prevent reporters from trying to put their candidate , and themselves , in the White House-more news organizations than ever are rotating correspondents from one candidate to the other . Campaign reporters have also covered the candidates ' staffs and even the rest of the press more closely this year . The Washington Post 's David Broder , for example , recently reported on the Carter press corps ' fondness for wisecracking Trip Director Jim King , who , after reporters found no working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route , announced that " because of the inexperience of the advance man at the next stop , the phones were not removed from the hotel as ordered . You will be able to file . " <P> Eye-Glaze . Still , both Ford and Carter have an inner circle of permanent scribes who know their candidates all too well . One day in Wisconsin , Ford reached the punch line of his basic speech ( " A Government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take from you everything you have " ) , and the press corps began chanting loudly along with him . Explains NBC Correspondent Bob Jamieson : " The eye-glaze factor begins about the same time each day . "
