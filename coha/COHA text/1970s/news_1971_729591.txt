txt Premier Chou En-lai of mainland China is prepared for a broad discussion of world problems with President Nixon when the latter comes here sometime before next May . The 73-year-old Chinese leader stressed in a five-hour interview last Thursday that he was not entirely preoccupied with the short-term problems of ending the war in Viet Nam and the controversy over Taiwan and China 's seat in the United Nations . He . said he also wanted to talk about the changing roles of the United States , Japan and the Soviet Union in Asia and the Pacific . Fear of Japanese He expressed some concern ( over what he insisted was the rise of Japanese militarism and Chou En-lei ambitions in Taiwan and Korea and the mobilization of massive Soviet power on China 's northern frontier . He referred calmly to the possibility of a Soviet attack on China . " We Chinese are not afraid of atom bombs , " he said . " We are prepared against their attack , against their launching a preemptive attack on us . That is why we are digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chou was often critical of the U. S. , the Soviet Union and especially Japan , but never belligerent , emotional , or bitter about the past . " China is a country which was blockaded by the . United States for more than 20 years , " he said . " Now , since there Is a desire to come and look at , China , it 's all right . And , since there is a desire to talk , we are also ready to talk . " Of course , it goes without saying that the positions of our two sides are different . . . . To achieve relaxation , there must be a common desire for it , so various questions must be studied , and all these questions may be placed on the table for discussion . " We do not expect a settlement of all questions at one stroke . That is not possible . That would not be practicable . But by contacting each other , we may be able to find out where we should start in solving these questions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sorted out was President Nixon 's doctrine of encouraging other nations to assume more of the military burden in the Pacific and the President 's desire for normalizing relations with China . Chou said the Nixon doctrine only encouraged the militarists in Japan to follow Japan 's economic expansion with military expansion . He called the Japanese people " a diligent and brave people and a great nation . " However , the U. S. was promoting their economic and military power , he asserted . Chou said that , if Washington did not handle the Taiwan and Korean questions carefully , Japan would move in as the U. S. pulled back and the militaristic movement had to be nipped soon . If he was so worried about the Japanese militarism , why was he so eager to get rid of t h e U. S.-Japanese security treaty which had been a restraining force on Japan , particularly in the nuclear field ? The nremier rejected this as a forced argument . He sale despite this treaty , " Japan with her present industrial capabil ities is fully able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She is able to manufacture ground-to-air missiles , ground . to-ground missiles , and sea-to ground missiles , " Chou added " As for bombers , she is all the more capable of manufacturing them . The only thing lacking is the nuclear warhead . " Japan 's output of nuclear power is increasing daily , " he added . " The United States ' supply of enriched uranium to Japan is not enough for her requirement , so she is now importing enriched uranium from other countries . And so her nuclear weapons can be produced readily . " If Japan gave up its , ambition in Taiwan and Korea , it might be possible to negotiate a Sino-Japanese mutual nonaggression pact , he said . However , Japan wanted to control Taiwan and was conniving with American reactionaires to keep Peking out of the U. N. and establish " an independent Taiwan , " he said . Chou was asked whether he could see the possibility of negotiating a nonaggression pact with the U. S. , the Soviet Union and Japan . He said this was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon Altho critical about past U. S. policy in China , Taiwan , Indochina and Japan , he said nothing critical of Nixon per sonally . He was eager for any information he could get about the President 's psychology . He praised the boldness of the President 's initiative in seeking the meeting . He showed detailed knowledge of a recent Nixon speech in Kansas City , Mo. , and said he was waiting for a transcript of the President 's latest news confer . ence . He also stressed that no private deals had been made during the recent Peking visit of Dr. Henry A. Kissinger , the President 's adviser for national security affairs . Chou refused to concede the slightest point on the Indochina , the Taiwan or U. N. controversies . It was all the way in or all the way out on China 's seat in the U. N. He was less vehement than the official news commentaries here on Secretary of State William P. Rogers ' " Two Chinas " formula . This was " not a step forward , ' he said mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indochina war , he insisted , He said China was backing the forces opposing the U. S. and would continue to do so until the U. S. withdrew . China Wants In The U. S. had committed the offenses in this part of the world and it was for " the doer to undo the knot , " Chou injected . The premier sounded like a man who had made up his mind that a major reappraisal was in progress among the major nations and that China wanted in on the talks . To him , Taiwan is a symbol of Western domination over China 's territory and he is determined to resolve that question . He did not suggest that President Nixon was refusing to get out of Viet Nam . He seemed more concerned about China 's future policy with Tokyo and Moscow ' than with Washington . He reserved his most critical comments for Japan . " When you oppose a danger you should oppose it when it budding , " Chou said . " Only then can you arouse public attention . " However , Chou was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw tie conflict between the U. N. principle of the peaceful set . tlement of disputes and Peking 's doctrine of supporting wars of national liberation . He even denied that China was a nuclear power  --  only an experimanhal one
