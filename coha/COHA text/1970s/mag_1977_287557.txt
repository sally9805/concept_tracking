Secretary of State Cyrus Vance settled into a rocking chair in his hideaway study on the seventh floor of the State Department and discussed the Moscow SALT talks with TIME Correspondents Strobe Talbott and Christopher Ogden . Vance angrily denied that Soviet-American relations were now at their lowest point in years , stoutly defended the Administration ' s " public diplomacy " and stressed that much in fact had been accomplished at the Moscow meeting . Excerpts from the interview : <P> <P> Q. The Soviets seemed categorical in their rejection . What makes you still hope that the ultimate agreement will be within the general framework of the substantial-reductions proposal ? <P> <P> A. I think if you 've been involved in negotiations before , whether in labor or in the international field , you find that parties may say one thing ; then , as they reflect on it further , they decide that there are points on which they want clarification or to make suggestions . The fact one person says on a given day that he finds something unacceptable does n't mean it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiations , and they suggested a specific time-late May in Geneva-for the resumption of the negotiations . <P> We think the ball is really in their court , in the sense that a constructive suggestion has been made that should be further explored . Let 's wait and see what happens . <P> <P> Q. Did the Carter Administration 's decision to go public with its SALT positions before the Moscow visit have an adverse effect on negotiations ? <P> <P> A. The President felt that this was a matter of vital importance to the people of our country , indeed to the people of the world , so he set forth the general outlines of what was to be proposed . The people had a right to know what we were going to be talking about , and I must say I do n't think the fact that the general outlines were set forward in that fashion had any negative or adverse effect on the discussions in any way whatsoever . <P> <P> Q. What benefit is there in a comprehensive SALT agreement for the Russians ? <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe they are seeking greater stability in the long run , and the comprehensive U.S. proposal will lead to that end . Our proposal also begins for the first time to get a handle on the problem of qualitative improvements . The U.S. package would require both sides to forgo certain systems that are now in the planning stage . Rather than letting the cruise missile run free , our proposal would put a limit on the range , and that 's something that should interest the Soviets . I think the Soviets recognize that we really have to make real cuts . How deep they are prepared to go I do n't know . We will have to wait and see . <P> <P> Q. Were the Soviets abrupt and even rude in their treatment of you ? <P> <P> A. There was no rudeness , none at all . The discussions were businesslike and frank . General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev said he intended to be frank , and I said I appreciated that and would be frank too . I found him courteous and straightforward . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very human thing . Even though I did n't expect an immediate agreement , I always hoped something constructive might occur . <P>
