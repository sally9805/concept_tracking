Stock exchanges are tightly knit clubs , and hardly anything has agitated their members more than the question of whether to let in the managers of mutual funds , pension funds , insurance companies and bank trust departments . By forming or buying brokerage subsidiaries that could trade on the exchanges , these institutional investors could save tens of millions of dollars every year in commissions . Many old-line brokers fiercely opposed institutional membership out of fear that they would lose commissions . Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission came out with a curious compromise : it ordered the exchanges to admit the institutions-but under conditions so restrictive that many of them may not want , or be able , to join . <P> The SEC decreed that brokerage affiliates of most investment institutions can join exchanges only if they do 80% or more of their business directly with the public and a mere 20% for their parent organization . If the brokerage subsidiary of a mutual fund expects to trade , say , $20 million worth of stock for the fund every year , it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80 million of business from outsiders . <P> First Time . Theoretically , the SEC action is of major importance . It marks the first time that the Government agency has told the exchanges whom they can and can not admit . But in practice it probably will mean little to the ordinary investor . Possibly some mutual-fund salesman may offer to handle the investor 's trades as well as try to sell him shares in the fund . But the biggest institutions have little chance of generating a public brokerage volume four times as large as their own trades , and thus would have to continue funneling most of the fund transactions through outside brokers . Accordingly , they could not save enough on commissions to make significant reductions in the fees that they charge to buyers of mutual-fund shares . <P> The controversy is unlikely to end with the SEC ruling . Some influential Congressmen are annoyed with outgoing SEC Chairman William J. Casey for acting without their prior approval . Democratic Senator Harrison Williams of New Jersey has offered a bill that would ban institutions that join exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if the exchanges agreed to accept negotiated , nonfixed commissions on any trades worth more than $100,000 . That way , brokers now on exchanges would be forced into sharp new bargaining with their biggest customers , and institutions probably could get commissions lowered enough to offer significant savings to the buyer of mutual-fund shares or the holder of rights in a pension fund .
