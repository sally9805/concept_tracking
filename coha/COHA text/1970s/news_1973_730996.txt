txt A little country cricket club is taking on the government of South Africa this week . The Aurora Cricket Club is multiracial and only in the second league , but unimpressed by government opposition , it simply will not stop playing games . The club has its headquarters in Pietermaritzburg which , in spite of its rather unwieldy Afrikaans-sounding name , is a quaint , humid city in Natal where you still see the British Union Jack flying from flagpoles and where some of the older people still talk about Britain as " home " even if they have never been there . Unless it is fishing for trot#4n the nearby mountains , there is little the locals like better than watching cricket . However , the government has very strict rules about games and , although it is all very well ? and quite legal ? for black hands to roll the pitch and trim the grass before the match , it itkquite against government policy for blacks and whites to play ball together at club level . Law examined Government ministers have made this clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom do not even know how cricket is played . But , unfortunately for the government , although there is a web of laws controlling race relations and what the various races can do ( and where ) , there is no specific law that says whites and blacks may not play games together ? and few people ever thought the government would try to pass one . So , after getting legal advice , the Aurora Cricket Club was formed , and duly admitted to the Pietermaritzburg second league . Their lawyers said that they would not be breaking any laws if they played on private grounds , if they allowed only invited spectators to watch , if black members did not change in " white " dressing rooms , and if the players did not drink any intoxicating liquor together . Its first match ? a friendly affair ? went off without a hitch . But the fact that it did so apparently infuriated certain members of the government . - Proclamation published The result was that the Minister of Sport , Dr. Piet Koornhof , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his party , was called in personally to , root out this " evil . " // *Sports ' crisis ' // His first move was to summon top officials of the club to his Pretoria home where he argued with them almost till dawn , trying to persuade them to disband the club and be " reasonable . " Then , when they refused , he " regretfully " published an extraordinary proclamation controlling black people 's " occupation " of proclaimed white areas . Legal experts who have studied the proclamation declare themselves " stupefied " by its provisions . Apart from the Aurora Cricket Club 's weekend sport , it looks as if the proclamation could stop blacks attending church services in white areas , stop them from going to art galleries and museums , ban them from watching horse racing and soccer matches , and even prevent black doctors attending symposiums with their white colleagues . So once again the Aurora Cricket Club went to see their lawyers . After studying the proclamation they decided that the government had " panicked and overreacted " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would be impossible to enforce in law . Confrontation nostnoned This view has been upheld since by a leading advocate who said the provisions of the proclamation are " absurd " and that it " can not survive . " . When the Aurora team duly turned up at the weekend for their first league match , the skies opened up and poured rain . But this has only postponed the confrontation . League officials have announced that the match will be played next weekend instead . Rain can not stop play indefinitely , and it merely remains now to see whether the government will find some way of backing down respectably before the match begins ? or will instruct the police to arrest the cricketers the moment they bowl the first ball .
