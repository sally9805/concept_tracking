TENNESSEE WILLIAMS ' LETTERS TO DONALD WINDHAM , 1940-65 <P> Edited by DONALD WINDHAM 333 pages . Sandy Campbell . $50 . <P> <P> When he appears on TV talk shows these days , Tennessee Williams seems to be his own Doppelganger : a pale , cackling self-parody . Even his 1975 memoirs were oddly out of focus , as if someone had jiggled his elbow every time he captured a memory . But in this rare collection , the author escapes the stream of self-consciousness to appear confessional and ceaselessly entertaining . <P> Horace Walpole , the greatest English epistolarian , said that letters should be nothing but conversations on paper . By that definition , Williams ranks as one of the best ( and least known ) American letter writers . The publication of this volume is unlikely to enhance his fame : following a promise to Tennessee , Donald Windham has published an elegant , limited edition of 526 copies . A great pity . The assemblage amounts to an autobiography available in no other form . <P> The letters , 159 in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent , Windham ( Two People ) is an aspiring novelist of 19 . Both are unknown and penniless . The mail continues until 1965 , when the increasingly cool friendship-it was never a romance-turns gelid . In the early letters money and sex dominate . " It seems that a Pulitzer prizewinner has swindled Mr. Mayer out of $60,000 on some kind of legal fraud , " Tennessee says in 1942 . " We must find out how he did it . There is no trick too low for my present nature . " <P> Williams ' first success comes in the mid- ' 40s with The Glass Menagerie . But during out-of-town tryouts , that too looks hopeless , and he despairs of the performance of Laurette Taylor , who plays Amanda , the mother . A tantrum rescues two careers : " Taylor was ad-libbing practically every speech and the show sounded like the Aunt Jemima Pancake hour , " he recalls . " We all got drunk , and this A.M. Taylor was even worse . I finally lost my temper and when she made one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' My God , what corn ! ' She screamed back that I was a fool and all playwrights made her sick - that she had not only been a star for 40 years but had made a living as a writer , which was better than I had done . Then she came back after lunch and suddenly began giving a real acting performance - so good that I wept . " <P> Greta Garbo tells him that she would like to make another picture - so long as the part is neither male nor female . " Regrets that she was not able to play Dorian Gray . . . " writes the acidulous scenarist . " In appearance she is really hermaphroditic , almost as flat as a boy with the cold quality of a mermaid . " Williams finds the 23-year-old Gore Vidal amiable , but only after " the strenuous effort it took to overlook his conceit . He has studied ballet and is constantly doing pirouettes and flexing his legs . The rest of the time he is com paring himself and Truman Capote his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balzac. "
