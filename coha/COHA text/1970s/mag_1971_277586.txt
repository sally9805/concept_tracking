Hollywood never learns . Or anyway , it forgets easily . Ten years ago , George C. Scott received his second nomination for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for The Hustler . He sent a wire to the Academy and quietly declined . He still remains unimpressed by Oscars . Nominated once again , as Best Actor for his part in Patton , Scott once again dispatched a telegram . <P> It read in part , " I respectfully request that you withdraw my name from the list of nominees . My request is in no way intended to denigrate my colleagues . Furthermore , peculiar as it may seem , I mean no offense to the Academy . I simply do not wish to be involved . " It was a polite request . Elsewhere , however , Scott was a little more explicit . " The whole thing is a goddam meat parade , " he said . " I do n't want any part of it . " <P> There has been no rush on the part of the other nominees to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow nominees for Best Actor ( Melvyn Douglas in I Never Sang for My Father , Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces , James Earl Jones in The Great White Hope , Ryan O'Neal in Love Story ) are all hanging right in there . The potential Best Actresses are , too . They include Carrie Snodgress in Diary of a Mad Housewife , Ali MacGraw in Love Story , Jane Alexander in The Great White Hope , Sarah Miles in Ryan 's Daughter and Glenda Jackson in Women in Love . Nominations in the other categories included the usual mind-boggling number of mediocrities : Airport , for instance , received a total of ten , including one for Best Picture . To Hollywood , quality and high budgets are often synonymous .
