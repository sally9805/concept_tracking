Americans who feel that foreign aid should be not only an instrument of Realpolitik but of moral judgment have two difficult cases to worry about . One is Greece , where in 1967 a clique of colonels overthrew a shaky but democratic and legally elected regime . After delivering some lectures and pressing for the restoration of democratic institutions , last September the U.S. lifted an embargo on deliveries of heavy military equipment to the Greek junta . An even more painful dilemma for the conscientious concerns Pakistan . In March the government there launched savage warfare against the East Pakistanis , who were seeking greater autonomy for their part of the divided country ( TIME cover , Aug. 2 ) . The U.S. quickly announced that it would stop authorizing arms shipments , though in fact they have continued . <P> Now , the normally docile Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives has produced a startling if largely symbolic expression of dismay . Last week the House followed the committee 's recommendation with a 200-to-192 vote to deny further U.S. military aid to Greece until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President determines that there are " overriding requirements of national security " for continuing it . The bill would also halt economic and arms aid to Pakistan until the President decides that " reasonable stability " has been restored there , and that the millions of Bengali refugees now in India have been allowed to return to their homes and regain their property in East Pakistan . <P> Irritated in Athens . The loophole in the aid-to-Greece clause was big enough to drive a Patton tank through , and it was virtually certain that the Administration would do just that . Greece 's role in NATO and the U.S. Navy 's need for Sixth Fleet bases in the eastern Mediterranean could easily be construed as " overriding requirements . " The net effect of the House vote , if the Senate concurs , would be to cut military aid to the colonels from Nixon 's requested $118 million in this fiscal year to $90 million , the same level as last year . <P> In Athens , an irritated Premier George Papadopoulos declared that whether Greece should hold elections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide . Simultaneously , his government drafted a new press code that requires foreign as well as Greek newsmen to report in conformity with " Hellenic-Christian traditions . " The House committee 's action in calling U.S. Ambassador Henry J. Tasca home from Athens to testify in closed session was an unusual display of congressional displeasure .
