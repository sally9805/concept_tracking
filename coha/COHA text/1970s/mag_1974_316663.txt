The front-page picture showed a terrified black man clinging to a railing as whites clawed at his shirt . Headlines summarized the sorry situation : SCHOOL SITUATION WORSENS , VIOLENCE SPREADS , BLACKS URGE FEDERAL ACTION . It might have been Birmingham or Biloxi in the 1960s-but it was Boston , last week . <P> As the court-ordered desegregation of Boston 's public schools went into its fourth week , an explosion seemed imminent . " We can no longer maintain either the appearance or the reality of public safety , " Mayor Kevin H. White said in a letter to Federal Judge W. Arthur Garrity , who had issued the desegregation ruling last June 21 . Added White , who asked Garrity to send in federal marshals to help enforce the ruling : " Violence which once focused on the schools and buses is now engulfing the entire community in racial confrontation . " <P> Much of the violence took place along Dorchester Street , a four-lane thoroughfare that is the main artery of South Boston , the center of opposition to forced busing . With feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarmed with police , including 300 members of the elite Tactical Patrol Force brought in to disperse crowds and protect the buses bringing black students to the area 's previously all-white schools . <P> The heavy police presence increased tension among Southie 's resentful Irish residents , and one evening a brick was heaved through the windshield of a cruising T.P.F. squad car . When the officers tried to arrest a suspect , two dozen Southie toughs set upon them , and the police lost the man in the crowd . The next night two dozen T.P.F. officers burst into the jampacked Rabbit Inn on Dorchester Street . As many as eight patrons were reported injured . Some Southies are convinced that the T.P.F. <P> raid was an outright reprisal for the previous night 's incident ; the police claim that they were merely answering a distress call . <P> Warning Shots . When school resumed last week , Southie was in an even uglier mood ; buses carrying black students were greeted with jeers and rocks . <P> At one point , a Haitian immigrant named Jean-Louis Andre Yvon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people surrounded Yvon 's car , smashed his windshield and pulled him out . Someone shouted , " Get the nigger ! " Yvon fled for the porch of a nearby house and clung to the railing as youths battered him with clubs . Only after a white policeman drew his pistol and fired some warning shots was a dazed and bleeding Yvon finally rescued . " He would have been dead if I had n't fired , " the policeman said later . <P> Trouble broke out the next day in predominantly black Roxbury . Black students roamed the streets , stoning cars and throwing rocks at the few white pedestrians . A white cab driver was hospitalized . Police let only black drivers into the area . " We just do n't have enough men to protect you , " a deputy police superintendent told white reporters . " Do n't look left or right . Just keep driving until you get to the suburbs .
