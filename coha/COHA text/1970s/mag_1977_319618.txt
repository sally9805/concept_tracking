While publicly professing their usual optimism , Detroit automakers for the past few weeks have been holding their breath . Their $6 billion investment in retooling for new models that have been sharply reduced in size and weight ( TIME , Aug. 1 ) represented a gamble : Would the public like the smaller " big " cars ? Last week the carmakers could relax a bit and repeat previous predictions of near record sales during the 1978 model-year with more conviction . New-car sales for the first 20 days of October-during which time most of the new models were in the showrooms-jumped 16% above a year earlier . That figure does not give a definitive reading of public response-early sales are distorted by heavy buying for company fleets-but it was about as good an opening as Detroit could have desired . <P> For everyone , that is , except American Motors-as usual . Alone among the four U.S. automakers , it suffered a sales decline , of a sharp 28.6% . That cut its long-sliding share of the U.S. market ( excluding imports ) from an already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the October period ( its high was 6.4% in 1963 ) . It was an inauspicious week for a new driver to take over . Nonetheless , Chairman Roy D. Chapin Jr. , the man most closely associated with AMC 's long struggle for survival , handed over the chief executive 's job to President Gerald C. Meyers . Chapin , 62 , from now on will concentrate on maintaining close ties to bankers , including those who every January are asked to renew AMC 's $72.5 million line of credit . Meyers , who was named one of TIME 'S 200 young American leaders in 1974 , becomes at 48 the youngest head of a U.S. car company . <P> The bad sales figures quickly revived perennial Detroit speculation that AMC can not be a car company much longer . Though American Motors expects to report a profit of $5 million for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 , v. a loss of $46.3 million in fiscal 1976 , cars had nothing to do with it ; profits on sales of Jeeps , postal vehicles and buses carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> To hear Meyers talk , however , if AMC does stop making cars the move would have to be forced over his dead body . It has long been AMC 's claim that it needs to stay with cars to spread its total vehicle production costs and give its dealers more to offer the public . Ironically , in 1970 , Meyers opposed AMC 's acquisition of the Jeep business , which has turned out to be a large part of the company 's salvation ; instead , he wanted to concentrate on cars . Today he admits that " Jeep is a gold mine . " Although AMC may no longer be able to exploit a niche in the auto market that the Big Three are unable or unwilling to fill , Meyers argues that AMC can still produce a distinctive auto with its small-car expertise . Meyers , a 6 ft. 2 in. engineer noted for his insistence on developing new products , asserts : " We 've got to give the people something new and something good . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
