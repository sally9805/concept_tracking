Prices and imports rise ; output and earnings sink <P> Whatever U.S. industry generally does , steel these days seems to do the opposite . Through most of the recession that ended in mid-1975 , steel profits climbed . But now , in the midst of recovery , steelmakers seem to be caught in the grip of Murphy 's Law : if anything can go wrong , it will . They are beset by production cutbacks and layoffs , Government pressure to restrain price increases while spending heavily to comply with antipollution rules , and the industry 's first sizable strike ( by iron-ore workers ) since 1959 . Executives have also begun squabbling among themselves . Last week Armco Steel not only refused to go along with an industry price boost of 6% on structural steel , but announced that in the lower Midwest and Gulf Coast regions it would offer deeper discounts : $50 a ton , v. $30 formerly , off the list price of $320 . Armco moved to match prices of imported steel , and its action points up the biggest trouble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones , executive vice president of Republic Steel , says : " Basically , it gets down to whether the U.S. steel industry is going to survive . " <P> Hyperbole aside , the steelmakers ' troubles are real and severe . Their profits in the first half dropped 48% , while earnings for all manufacturing industry rose 8% . At U.S. Steel Corp. , a 52% plunge in first-half profits has prompted the company to ask 10,000 nonunion and management employees to give up a cost of living raise averaging $19 a month that was due in August . Chairman Edgar Speer also indicated that some operations would be suspended at the company 's Youngstown , Ohio , mill , and that construction of a $4.5 billion integrated plant in Conneaut , Ohio , might be postponed . At Bethlehem Steel , where first-half profits dived 88% , the board halved the quarterly dividend , to 250 a share , closed three small mills and made plans to lay off 7,300 out of 22,900 workers at plants in Johnstown , Pa. , and Lackawanna , N. Y. <P> Argus Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such cutbacks will deepen-indeed , that the industry will reduce its production capacity by as much as 20% over the next five years , as it closes more and more marginal mills . In Argus ' view , that would be good for steel : costs would be reduced and profits would eventually rise . <P> Many more mills may close-and much earlier-if the strike of 15,000 iron-ore workers that began Aug. 1 drags on . Though the industry is governed by a much praised agreement that bans strikes over " economic " issues , the miners contend that their demand for incentive pay ( mainly bonuses for exceeding production norms ) is a " local " issue , about which strikes are permitted . For now , mills can feed their blast furnaces with stockpiled ore , but if the strike continues another three or four months-and it could-they would start to run short .
