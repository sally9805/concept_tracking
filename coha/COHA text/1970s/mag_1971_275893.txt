Nixon 's New Economics ( Contd . ) <P> Sir : The President 's lack of courage and insight throughout the last year and a half has forced him to take drastic action in the area of wages and prices . His complete wage-price freeze erases all equity . It rewards those unions and businesses that have demanded and received exorbitant increases in 1971 , while penalizing those that have exercised restraint and have n't received increases this year . <P> While asking that we bite the bullet , the President has lost sight of the fact that many now have weakened gums , and that some no longer have any teeth . <P> SAMUEL S. ROSEMAN Stanhope , N.J. <P> Sir : Thank God ! Nixon is the one man who had the guts to do what should have been done ten years ago . I 'm sorry I did n't vote for Nixon in ' 68 , but rest assured I shall in ' 72 . <P> KENT LAWRENCE Nashville , Kans . <P> Sir : In an age when the average homeowner ca n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responds with his anti-inflationary proposal , which says in effect : " Let them eat cars ! " The only way a homeowner can now get any money back is not through lowered prices or raised salaries but by a refund for every new car he buys . <P> MARTI KAPLAN Long Beach , Calif . <P> Sir : George Meany 's intemperate blast at the President 's wage and price freeze , a policy that seems remarkably fair and free of favoritism , sounds for all the world like a spoiled brat 's demand for instant wish gratification . He obviously means to have his own way , even if it 's at everyone else 's and the country 's expense , and regardless of how any of us may feel about it . If his demands are not met will he throw a tantrum or hold his breath till his face turns blue ? <P> KENNETH T. ROBINSON Lewiston , N.Y . <P> Sir : I am so dismayed by the reaction of the large unions and other groups that are fighting President Nixon 's wage and price freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he has finally done something that makes sense . What 's wrong with Americans that they ca n't make a sacrifice for their country ? And it is their country , not just President Nixon 's . <P> KATHRYN I. KELLEY Boston <P> Sir : It is quite obvious that the culprit responsible for America 's international monetary problems is Japan . The U.S. is therefore being grossly unfair in penalizing Canada , whose currency has been floating for some time now . <P> The U.S. is acting like the schoolteacher who makes the whole class stay after school because of the misbehavior of one student . <P> JOSEPH A. TORBAY Callander , Ont . <P> That Gentle Land <P> Sir : As a student of both Irish and British history , I found it incredible that you describe Great Britain as " that most gentie and civilized of lands " Aug. 23 . Surely you speak in jest . No other country could compete with the imperialistic , bloody past of England . In her notorious history , that " gentle land " has been involved in war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait seems to stem mainly from misguided English efforts to civilize the rest of the barbaric world . I remember that Americans ' forebears threw the English out of America in 1776 . The Nationalists in Derry are merely following in that tradition . <P> BARBARA A. BRADY Potomac , Md.
