Moving up out of the desert each spring and fall , the khamsin is an ill wind that blows no one in the Middle East any good . It picks up hot air and dust as it sweeps across Africa and the Sinai Peninsula , bringing a variety of afflictions in its northerly thrust . The moistureless air causes feet to swell painfully , noses and eyes to itch and asthmatics to gasp for breath . The khamsin can also madden men . Automobile accidents are far more frequent when it is blowing , crime rates increase by as much as 20% and tempers rise with the mercury . Judges in some Arab countries take a lenient attitude toward crimes committed during the khamsin . <P> Zero Humidity . Most Middle Eastern countries have learned to live with the problem . The Israelis , however , are trying to do something about it . A team headed by Professor Felix Gad Sulman of the Hebrew University 's Department of Applied Pharmacology in Jerusalem has conducted a nine-year study that has not only identified the medical causes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The findings could have international significance , since wind-borne woes afflict millions of people on several continents . Italy suffers each year from the effects of the sirocco , France from the mistral , the Alpine regions from the foehn . Chinook winds bring a touch of seeming madness to the Rocky Mountain area each winter , and the Santa Ana wind makes thousands of Californians miserable . Sulman 's experiments show that this misery may be lessened . <P> His team had an ideal laboratory . Jerusalem has up to 150 days of khamsin a year , during which time temperatures soar above 90 while the relative humidity plummets toward zero . Half of the city 's population suffer from some kind of khamsin-related condition . For many , the misery is minor , such as swelling of the extremities . For others , how ever , the effects are far more pervasive . <P> The hot , dry atmosphere produced by the khamsin contains an excess of positive ions . Young people , whose metabolic rates tend to be high , react to such atmospheric conditions by absorbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally become overcharged . Their hair becomes electrified and stands on end , and they develop migraine headaches and nausea . They become tense , irritable and occasionally violent . They also secrete large amounts of serotonin , a hormone associated with the nervous system . <P> Many older people have an entirely different reaction . Long-term exposure to the enervating heat appears to lessen their production of adrenaline , a hormone that maintains blood pressure and helps regulate cardiac function . The older folk become fatigued , apathetic and depressed . They may also become faint , thus contributing to the increased number of automobile accidents . <P> How to Cope . In clinical studies involving 500 people , Sulman 's team experienced few problems in treating the majority of patients . Small doses of drugs called monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors aided the elderly by slowing the breakdown of adrenaline . Drugs that prevent serotonin buildup helped those adversely affected by the ionized air . So did the lonotron , a machine the size of a tabletop radio .
