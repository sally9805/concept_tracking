ONE OF THE MORE DIVERTING EXPERIENCES in working on The New Republic early in the Forties was to attend editorial lunches in its private dining room a floor below . These had been a famous institution in the paper 's early days on West 21st Street , when no doubt Herbert Croly and Francis Hackett and Walter Lippmann and Robert Mores Lovett and Edmund Wilson had had a good deal to say to each other . I had heard much of these brilliant occasions , had read about them in books , had been told that in particularly genial moments during the playful Twenties , the editors had put manuscripts on the enormous lazy Susan that was a famous centerpiece and had sent them whirling around to each other . But in 1942 the great interest of these lunches for me was the vividness of some famous guest . For some weeks that fall of 1942 , there was a sizable representation of old New Republic editors and contributors . Van Wyck Brooks , white hair en brosse and headm'aster 's thick white moustache , straddled the hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately to look at ease . I suspected him of wanting to take off for that literary arcadia where all writers were unfailingly gentle like himself , even exquisitely fragile , and wrote with old-fashioned pen nibs all day long in their New England country houses without having to go out to lunch with editors at 49th and Madison . Brooks 's writing had always had a special charm for me . He had a gift for locating his literary subjects in a moment and place that made any of his books vibrate for me with Van Wyck Brooks 's ownmoment and place in American literature . He was more and more an artist in literary history rather than the powerful radical critic who had written America 's Coming of Age and The Ordeal of Mark Twain . His history of American writers in the nineteenth century was becoming not only his major effort , but also his spiritual home . His emotion . al attacks on the " avant-garde " ? on " nihilism " ? on Eliot , Joyce , and Proust ? had become war propaganda , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equated with lack of political faith and made responsible for Fascism and its victories against the West . But though Brooks had all our attention at lunch , he was as private as a writer in his study . To see Van Wyck Brooks in the New Republic dining room , gently slipping away from every public topic , was like reading New England : Indian Summer again and coming upon Howells and James in the Boston Public Garden . It was all charm . He enlisted protective feelings . In that dining room high above Madison Avenue , overbright with the sharp New York light , Brooks all white and portly , looked like the stubby Mr. Howells himself , that damnably genial man , or " the white Mr. Longfellow " after he had grown a beard to hide the marks of the fire that had killed his wife . Unlike Stark Young , who was still our drama critic but on his rare appearance at an office lunch would in his exaggerated Mississippi accent subtly undermine the fine liberal professions circulating around the table , Brooks seemed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just untouched by it . Young was openly contemptuous . He was still involved with contemporary writing . He Was the most interesting American writer on theater I had ever read . Though he sooner or later wove his way round to a characteristic observation , he could be alarmingly faithful to the idiosyncrasy of his own mind , and wrote a " drama piece " as if he needed to please only himself . A review by Stark Young was like a rambling , slightly woozy monologue after dinner . punctuated by hiccups as he sat over his walnuts and wine , in the course of which he said more good things about theater as stylized human behavior , and more interesting things about the Broadway commodity before him , than you would have expected from that great bald Charlus heavily sitting at table in his Southern mansion . Young was such an actor , such a flirtatiously genial , oily , subtle , yet strangely halting speaker and writer , that I could never tell how much he was enlarging the stories he liked to tell me about Chaplin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to enlarge himself . He was the only critic I would ever know who seemed as created as a character in a novel . I knew him as a performer in conversation , where he played so many parts ? and imitated so many people ? that he seemed to be keeping himself afloat by his dissimulation and the comic fixity of his eye as he grew seductive . He stumbled about in his mind the way he did in his reviews , but he always got to some particular effect he wanted by ruminating and by waking from his thoughts to give you , if he liked something you had written , valuable first editions and unpublished manuscript poems that Robert Frost had given him when they were instructors at Amherst College . I did not know then that Frost had had wicked Stark Young fired from Amherst , thus eventually sending him to The New Republic . In Stark Young I glimpsed , for the first time , the delightful chaos that a Southern writer could be . He had not organized himself for success , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York intellectuals I knew . He was as full of manner and malice , of charm , learning , and sheer pretense , as the South itself . With his many dark and light places slowly rotating before any eyes , 1 felt about him , as I did about Tom Sancton weeping over attacks on Negro soldiers in the South , and later about Allen Tate even in our most furious disagreements , that Southern writers were more tragically in conflict with themselves and their past , moodier yet more sympathetic , than any other writers I met in the office . They had more obstinately personal standards of excellence than most of the people who contributed to The New Republic . With this went a homesickness for the South they could no longer live in that made them notice everything in New York with derisory eyes . One " visitor 's day " at lunch , when Max Lerner , as resolutely ready to confront any social evil as a boxer waiting for that first clang of the bell , was denouncing Southern poll taxes , Stark Young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , and in his richest plantation accent , said dreamily , " Has n't Max the most beautiful eyes ? " HERE WAS 1 ? 0 CONNECTION between the notaWWes at lunch below and the young Village writers angrily waiting in my office for me to give them books to review . Reviewers at The New Republic now tended to be not the old radical hacks of the Thirties but young poets , painters , and novelists belligerently on their way up , and contemptuous of established names . Through the Chicago writer Isaac Rosenfeld , whose wife Vasiliki was my secretary , I met Saul Bellow , who was also just in from Chicago , and who carried around with him a sense of his destiny as a writer that excited everyone around him . Bellow was the first writer I met of my generation who talked of Lawrence and Joyce , Hemingway and Fitzgerald , not as books in the library but as fellow operators in the same business . He would say , as confidently as if he were Hemingway himself , that Fitzgerald was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right places , " and , familiarly calling on D. H. Lawrence to support his own thought , he would say that he , too , needed " no umbrella " over his head , that he wanted direct contact with everything around him . I soon believed , as his other friends did , that Bellow was of their company ; his convictions were professional , rooted , fundamental in their good sense . I liked to show him New York , but I could never walk down the street with him without feeling that his intelligence made every object more real . There was nothing willed or psychological about his sense of destiny . He was proud in an austere way , like an old Jew who feels himself closer to God than anybody else . Far from being smug , he was as openly vulnerable as anyone I had ever met . The proud craftsman who like the young Joseph airily confided his dreams of greatness to his brothers would be quick to divide the world into disciples and enemies . I believed in his vocation all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was a personal treasure undamaged by his anxieties . Saul was as clearly a man chosen by talent as those great Jewish virtuososHeifetz , Rubinstein , Milstein , Horowitz ? who had been shaped into slim and elegant men of the world by talent alone . Even his conscious good looks were those of a coming celebrity . But the fact that Saul 's was a talent for the literature of direct experience impressed me most . It seemed to have something to du with his love of Yiddish and Jewish jokes , his air of consciously weighing all things in his path , his sense of life as a prodigious fact . Saul was the first Jewish intellectual I had ever met who seemed as clever about many sides of life as a businessman . He was in touch . I lived my life among brilliant intellectuals and theoreticians , and would soon encounter Lionel Trilling , who had been very generous to my book and one day came into the office to discuss some possible pieces with Bruce Bliven . Trilling , then thirty-seven , was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fated to have much conver-sation . With his distinguished gray hair , his look of consciously occupying an important place , his already worn face of thought , his air of subtle dis-crimination , he quietly defended himself from many things he had left behind . Saul , who was equally an intellectual and bookish , was so much a storyteller , creating his own myths out of every-one he had known in Chicago , that he loosened the bonds of ideology for the rest of us . It was refresh-ing to be with a man so quick to size up souls , jobs , writers , the effects of apartment-house living on his friends in New York , who made very funny jokes and double entendres at which he was the first to laugh with pleasure in things so well said . In 1942 Bellow had not yet published his first novel , but Chicago seemed to have a lot to do with his self-confidence . New York was so big and im-portant that no novelist had ever mastered the whole city as Dreiser had " expressed " Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-petual culture show was no help to a novelist . The intellectual directness of Bellow and his friend Isaac Rosenfeld seemed to me a product of Chi-cago itself ? the city created , Henry Blake Fuller said , expressly for the purpose of making money . Chicago gave people the Midwestern openness , the sense of being at home in America . It had so clearly been made by a few recent generations that a writer could still take it all on . Even the lofty Great Books curriculum at Hutchins 's University of Chicago brightened perspective on so much contemporary reality . Bellow 's conversation was full of the Great Books and jokes from Greek plays . By now Chicago had done its best for Saul and Isaac ; they were in New York , but they were not like other New Yorkers . Isaac had specialized in philosophy and Saul in anthropology , but , far from wishing to become scholars , there was an intellectual playfulness about them both , a gift for insurrectionary proposals , that made me see them as characters from The Possessed in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation to raise a little dust . Chicago had kept them serious . They expected great things of themselves as creative artists , but both had a taste for speculation . In their even , clear Midwest voices they would come out with Nietzschean aphorisms in the midst of some general clowning at Isaac 's first ramshackle apartment in New York on Christopher Street , or when we went across on the Christopher Street Ferry to Hoboken to eat oysters and drink beer at an old pub near the rusty ferry . The issue was always how to break through . Both seemed to have unusual inner freedom . But Bellow really had this freedom , was soon to dramatize it in those advancing and exploring heroes who are the center of his fiction . Isaac looked as Old World as our fathers . He was short and round , bespectacled , and in public frantically friendly . He was to search all through his short and calamitous life ? he died at thirty-eight ? for Saul 's master touch . He was to veer from logical positivism to orphic romanticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction to criticism , from Trotsky to Gandhi , from bohemia to bohemia ? a jolly-sounding but increasingly desperate pilgrim searching for the essence of conviction that would turn all things for him . ISAAC NEVER BECAME THE WRITER he occasionally ' wanted to be , the writer that his friend Saul Bellow was destined to be . One could never be sure with Isaac how serious he was about writing . He was too busy trying his life out . He lived not like a writer but like a character in search of a plot . Every day he woke up determined to be a new man , to recast everything , to try a new role , to be attractive , promiscuous , and wise . What another man with Isaac 's lovely imagination might have put entirely into his work , Isaac sought frantically to make life . He wanted to cast himself as a wholly new being ? and must often have gone to his desk , after exhausting himself all day long in private fantasies and loving entanglements with the many people who were always around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came to use them , were after the heat of experience so frigid . But though he would have more and more the look of someone who had unaccountably lost his way , Isaac as a character in this life-drama of his own creating had distinction . He had gone straight to the Angst behind all our lives , and like Jacob wrestling with the angel , Isaac said to this fear , this demon . I will not let thee go belore thou bless roe . Every Jew I knew lived with this fear , but Isaac , so articulate that he seemed to be mocking his fear , ran to meet it , live with it , argue it away . He often awoke , he told me , in sheer fright , " scared shitless . " When he described for me the cold damp winter mornings in Chicago as he candled eggs in his father 's dairy , I could see him shaking in the dark store with broken eggs around his feet . He confronted his personal terror , endlessly bemused , even proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afternoon with Isaac , who was an excellent flutist glad to play for you at any time , who was never too busy to see anybody , who had imitated Smerdyakov murdering old Karamazov and Ivan Karamazov arguing with the Devil , had just mimicked his friends with enthusiasm and had explained how Moby Dick had converted him from logical positivism , his little conies of Jewish mavericks in Chicago seemed overconscious in effect . He liked to rear ) unfinished drafts aloud . watching your face , but even his fine voice and the beautifully formed letters on the yellow sheets made this a social form . Reading Isaac 's fiction . I could always see the theoretician of morals standing apart from the writer of fiction and waiting to comment on the action that had been impatiently sketched in . Unlike Bellow , who could use every morsel of his experience ? even his college training in anthropology would turn up in Henderson the Rain King Isaac lived his fantasies , and in company . He settled into the Village with the excitement of a writer discovering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded every night with people who , once they had boisterously climbed up four flights and fought their way into the apartment past Isaac 's jittery black hound , Smokey , looked as if they never planned to find their way out again . One wall of the Rosenfeld kitchen was lined with snapshots of these same friends . Isaac always greeted people wildly , as if any visitor liberated him from an intolerable dilemma . He liked a certain confusion around him as proof that he was welcoming life with open arms . Since Isaac was usually not yet ready to write , felt that he had first to solve his " problem , " to understand himself , he easily gathered around him many dreamy Village types who also had to talk away their fears before they could write . Isaac brought charm to this pursuit of the psyche . He gave himself to conversation with the mad energy of a clown and apothegms of a thinker still faithful to Wisdom . In his brilliant wanderings , he usually came upon and regularly vanquished his lifelong intimate ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry speculation , everything waited for the great beast to be sighted . No wonder that Moby Dick had converted Isaac from logical positivism . Thinking aloud in his dark and madly jammed living loom with neurotic Smokey yipping and biting him at every word , Isaac was alone on these seas of thought , alone in the universe with his prey , like Captain Ahab . Like many a nineteenth-century American author , he sometimes suspected that the universe at large waited for him to decide it , that everything still hung in the balance . For Isaac as for me , " socialism " had been a critical instrument , not a blueprint for economic planning . Now he turned away from all such fictions to Dr. Wilhelm Reich 's philosophy of the orgone . Isaac even as a reader of novels was more interested in ideology than in manners . His favorite characters were philosophic loners ? Ishmael , K. , Raskolnikov . Society was for the bourgeois intellectual who " adjusted " to it . On polarities Isaac rested . It was 1942 , the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war took everything as a political failure . Socialism had been shown up as a cover for authoritarian instincts ; we knew about the death camps before we saw the word " Auschwitz . " But though Isaac and I talked Blake and Tolstoy and Nietzsche to each other all the time ? what Great Books lectures we gave each other ! ? none of these marvelous liberators of the human conscience , these prophets of the divine energy in man , could solve my problem , which was what to do with myself , how to tie up with what was happening . I felt in excess , idle , bitterly outside , and envied those friends of mine who , though they went into the Army or Merchant Marine or OWI howling at the waste of their personal genius , managed , I noticed from their later writings , to have satisfied some gnawing fantasies of participation and even of power . At times I responded , in Isaac 's Village kibbutz , to urgent existential manifestos about the abIIIHE PROCESS OF DISCOVERING his " animal na1 ture " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own flesh for lack of someone else , Isaac drove himself wild trying to make his body respond with the prodigality promikd by theory . Following Dr. Wilhelm Reich 's conviction that some of the orgone energy at large in the atmosphere could be absorbed by an individual sitting inside a wooden box built and lined with metal to Dr. Reich 's specifications , Isaac , determined to extract more genitality from the universe at large , built himself an orgone box in his bedroom . Like so many of Isaac 's attempts to apply his imaginative vision to life , this orgone box was compromised by his poverty and his many interests . It was too evidently a homemade , a bargain-basement orgone box . It looked more like a cardboard closet or stage telephone booth than it did a scientific apparatus by which to recover the sexual energy which one had lost to repression . Isaac 's orgone box stood up in the midst of an enormous confusion of bedclothes , books , manuscripts , children , and the dozens of people who went in and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his orgone box , daring philistines to laugh , Isaac nevertheless looked lost , as if he were waiting in a telephone booth for a call that was not coming through . He was so intent on breaking through every imagined repression and anxiety , on not yielding an inch to the Jewish-Puritan Enemy , that he finally turned sexual freedom and power into an imaginary country , like the world of his adored Kafka and of his adored Gandhi . This country in which he lived his perfect life was always on the other side of the barrier . It was a country to which Isaac sought entrance , toward which he groped , but it was never the country where Isaac lived . He soon wore himself out trying to break through in every direction at once . Every issue became one of " our animal nature , " on which Isaac felt compelled to make a stand for freedom , openness , genitality . But meanwhile he had a family to support , he worked on trade papers , he was briefly on The New Republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell rather than to the breakthrough . There were times , I knew , when he envied some of his less talented but more openly manic Village friends their concentration on " living , " on public " bailing . " He would talk wistfully about two friends of his , the brothers Stein , who made a family affair out of their orgies , shared the same girls , determinedly took no precautions in what they called " Russian roulette , " but had an abortion fund against the times that " they " lost . I often met at Isaac 's house a tall , dim , lost girl from the Midwest who lived with a young Village intellectual but had such intense personal blackouts that 1 marveled at her powers of survival . " I have my journal , " she said . In some way Isaac envied her openness to so much pain . The cabin boy Pip in Moby Dick jumped out of the harpooner 's boat in fear , but going mad in the sea touched ultimate truth . One of the brothers Stein eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim sweet girl from the Midwest , always on the verge of going down for the last time , seemed to be summoning other people to go down with her . Isaac was drawn to these friends . He felt that other people had the final , the absolute , the terrible courage to be so vulnerable . Even when his own fiction missed immediacy and disappointed people , he took his literary adventures as a sacrifice to truth . To have the courage of your " animal nature " was to be a victim of society . Isaac as his own subject eventually drove himself wild . Stuck between his demands on experience and his desire to be a writer , he missed out in both . As my neighbor on 24th Street said about his wife , Isaac was a " failure . " Precocious in everything and understandably worn out , he died at thirty-eight . Even his dying would be a kind of " failure . " But Isaac 's best hope for himself was never to save himself , and in this he succeeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect faith , he awaited the Messiah . Every day in the frantic Village of the war years , reducing himself to " perfect sex , " orgone boxes , endless book reviews , and all-night conversations with his friends , he radiated an inability to compromise with the things of this world . There were evenings in Barrow Street , when I played the violin part in Bach 's B Minor Suite to Isaac 's flute , when his sense of style would make me gasp , when the sound of those notes reverberating off Isaac 's breath like water drops were of a silvery intensity , when it seemed to me that Isaac expressed himself in perfection at last , wrote his signature on the air . Going down the steps of that Barrow Street tenement and out through the eccentric streets of the Village , the sound of Isaac 's impeccable phrasing still in my ears , I felt that some promised beauty in my life waited for me . The Village streets were suddenly without the usual New York ruler-sharp order ; streets crossed that had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something not in the name of history , but to gratify myself alone , surprised me . I had written a book but did not yet feel like a writer ; I did not feel directed by imagination alone , as Isaac always did . But in the presence of music I always felt redirected , and on Barrow Street I had a new instinct . A few Sundays later . when I sat with Natasha at the New Friends of Music concert at Town Hall and for the first time heard Artur Schnabel playing Schubert waltzes , the intellectual suppleness of his phrasing , the mind and the music playing to each other , almost for each other , gave me such a vision of what the imagination could live for , that I felt myself drifting away from the tyranny of ideas . I was restless ; there was a wild longing in my heart to move on and to he changed . On Sunday afternoons , when Natasha and I ambled along the East River , looked at the factories pasted on the Brooklyn horizon , sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town Hall were the only America they could approve of , I felt the same exasperation with my steady diet of culture that I felt toward The New Republic when it found the war promising the revolution of the little man , and complained that only Winston Churchill 's unnaturally reactionary opinions kept the promising alliance with Stalin from making the world new . F XCEPT FOR THOSE FRIENDSOF MINE who were already in the Army and out of sight , almost all the " old Socialists " I knew in New York seemed to feel that the war was none of their business , that morally they had to stay out of it , that the wildly expanding power of the government at home and of Stalin 's control in Eastern Europe were the same positive evils , like Hitler . I could no more share this detachment from the war than I could believe in the liberal 's hopes for it that were being published in The New Republic like advertisements . I saw no alternatives to defeating Hitler ; I wanted us to live . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also clear that if the Nazis were going to be beaten anywhere , it would be in Russia . I hated Stalin , but in 1943 it seemed to be him or Hitler . Any " position " I might adopt toward Stalin would express my own wishes , not the facts of power . Ideological radicalism in the United States had become a professional game among those in the know , but without any bearing on events . The chief use of the Communist movement in America had evidently been to make ex-Communists ? " experts " on Communism whose political wisdom consisted in advising a helpless Europe that Nazism and Communism should destroy each other . The radical splinter groups a ere entirely concerned with defaming each other . One said that Russia was a " degenerated " workers ' state , but nevertheless a workers ' state . Another said that it was no workers ' state at all but a species of monopolistic state control . With the Lovestoneites , who had been right-wing Communists and would soon become total patriots ; the Fieldites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so of no concern to themselves as the only true revolutionary Leninists ; the Musteites , who were on their way out of intramural radical oppositionism ; the Cannonites , who were the only official followers of Leon Trotsky and had been accredited by the " Old Man " himself ; the Shachtmanites , who loved their dead leader more than ever , but had not been able to share his obstinatefaith in the authoritarian order he had helped to create ; the old Socialists , who thought it was 1917 and that a simple antiwar stand was all the politics required of them ; the neo-Gandhian conscientious objectors , whose consciences principally objected to the British Empire ; and the Catholic COs , whose consciences principally objected to an alliance with Russia , I could not see that these positions had any relevance to the necessary struggle against Hitler . Not Russia 's fight for life but Stalin 's betrayal of the Russian Revolution was the issue among many intellectuals in New York . There was a night , at the opening of the film North Sao- which Lillian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself looking at the preposterously idyllic scenes showing the beauty of Soviet life before the war while listening to outraged shouts of protest from Melvin Lasky , who was to be after the war the editor of Encounter , and from other future leaders of the Congress for Cultural Freedom . Stalin united old radicals into a small elite that in the midst of war would send up its lonely protest against the murder of Ehrlich and Alter , the leaders of the Polish Jewish General Workers Bund . Stalin drove old radicals crazy with rage and frustration . They awoke every morning hoping to read that Hitler and Stalin had destroyed each other and there was a new , democratic Russian Revolution . Instead , they had to read that the Russian people rallied amazingly to the Soviet despots despite the succession of early Nazi victories , that the Red Army was now winning the greatest land battles in history and was forging on , soon to occupy Poland , Romania , Hungary , Bulgaria , and Eastern Germany . Stalin 's occupation of Eastern Europe was a political blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would soon be a catastrophe for non-Communists in all territory controlled by the Red Army ? not least in Russia itself , where Hitler 's frightfulness united behind Stalin many Russians who after the war were imprisoned or shot . But the bitterness of so many intense and informed radical intellectuals was natural to them as Americans , as spectators , as onlookers , as theoreticians . American power would have its attraction for them later with the Cold War , when so many ex-Communists would pop up at Senator Joseph McCarthy 's side as " experts on the Communist conspiracy , " or edit cultural magazines in Europe with secret CIA funds . But so long as America and Russia were allies , they were out of it ; just as Communists everywhere had been out of it when Germany and Russia were allies . The first issue with both would always be Russia . IT WAS NOT STALIN but that damned Roosevelt ' who seemed to be most in Edmund Wilson 's mind when I first talked with him at this time . Wilson 's political opinions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to a stranger at a time of intellectual discouragement ? those of Charles A. Beard and the sourest isolationist Congressman . I admired his writing so much that I could never ? then or later ? take his political opinions with the required seriousness , for he seemed to me in equal measure gifted and self-willed . In late 1942 , when he summoned me after having read my book on modern American literature , Wilson still had the old-fashioned American progressive 's total disapproval of the war . He had of course broken with The New Republic . Ile now felt that he was being kept out of magazines . He was soon to have an immense personal revival through his association with The New Yorker , and would even become a roving war correspondent . But the afternoon I called on him , he had just come back from The Nation , where Freda Kirchwey , to whom the war was even more an anti-Fascist crusade than it was to The New Republic , had turned down some proposal he had made . In themselves , Wilson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any other stubbornly oppositionist American of the time . It was not the political consistency of To the Finland Station , published the year before , that had made this imaginatively conceived history of the great socialist thinkers so fascinating a gallery of portraits . In fact Wilson during the writing of his book had virtually lost his faith in the socialist idea , as so many of us had during Stalin 's purges . Although Wilson with his marvelous determination got Lenin to the Finland Station at last , it was Lenin 's fiery spirit rather than his destructive views that kept Wilson at his side . Even in his articles on purely literary subjects , Wilson tended to be uneasy and fussy in dealing with ideas then removed from the personal and historic context that was his genius . You felt that his interest was not in the concepts of socialism but in his obligation to himself to remove every intellectual obstacle he met in his exploration of some given subject . He liked to affirm himself a materialist , an atheist , and even a behaviorist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professions of opinion . From the time I first read Axel 's Castle , 1 loved Wilson 's writing passionately and knew that he was not only a remarkable critic because he put you directly in touch with any work he discussed , but also an original , an extraordinary literary artist who wove his essays out of the most intense involvement with his materials . In meeting him now , my admiration of his creative singularity was attested by a certain seediness , the great bold dome , the lack of small talk , the grumpy , wearingly thorough concentration on every topic he came to . It was his intense personal experience of writers that had always fascinated me in Wilson , that had sent me back many times to the last paragraph of the essay on Proust in Axel 's Castle in which he spoke of him as a " many-faceted fly , " to the sections on Dickens 's early struggles in The Wound and the Bow , to the portrait of Michelet in To the Finland Station , for the felt reverberations of the life behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thepersonal drama it had been for the writer . He could bring out all the implications of a hook in his portrait of the writer as a creative consciousness . Literature became an experience of the writer 's mind , for Wilson 's greatest gift was a peculiar openness to every detail about a writer as model for his own experience ; his famous lifelong diaries were invisible , but it was obvious that he carefully noted everything about his own experience as his mystical bond to literature . Despite Wilson 's scorn for Emerson and Thoreau as romantic isolatoes sentimentally seeking Cod in nature , Wilson 's mind in its hypnotized fidelity to minute details of experience was just like theirs . He , too , was trying to turn his life into a work of art . Like them , he had a passion for journals and memoirs , for the biographical context of literature and history , for the personal setting , that explained the charm of his writing and the gripping tension behind it . He had exposed himself to literature as the maximum experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did not anywhere else . It was exactly the communicated depth of this experience that I missed in other American radicals ? this absorption in the actual work in hand , this visible pressure on him of every fresh thought , that made him so absorbed and cranky , unselfconscious and a " character . " But everything I had guessed from my devoted reading and from hearsay was to come home to me with unexpected force that day late in 1942 . It was a strange , sulfurous afternoon . Wilson and his wife Mary McCarthy were staying in a borrowed apartment somewhere in the East Thirties near the Third Avenue El ; he seemed at loose ends , uncomfortable with himself as well as with me . When I arrived , he had not yet returned from his visit to The Nation ; he soon came in , quite sour , curtly indicated that his opposition to the war was making things difficult , and then grumblingly turned his attention to me . I had already discovered , in my few weeks there , that Wilson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fear of a eel. - tain implacable quality in his personality . One of his greatest admirers on the staff was a woman who thought him not only a genius but enormously attractive ; she added with some awe that he could be " hard as a diamond . " At the moment , the danger Hitler presented to the world was so acute that I could no longer see any point to the obstinacy of Wilson 's isolationism . Although I thought it ridiculous that so peculiarly gifted a writer should be unable to obtain reviews from The Nation , I also felt that Wilson was full of prejudices formed by a more sheltered and complacent America than I knew . His isolationism seemed to me unreal , assertive , merely proud . Van Wyck Brooks , in these same years , had been making his " usable past " out of the lives of American writers . Though I delighted in Brooks 's personal artistry , I felt that he had enclosed himself in nineteenth-century lives in order to find tranquillity , that he had turned the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so enchanted with these materials that he allowed the reader to suppose that the best American writers were equally uncomplicated . Wilson , in his tougher , more demanding way , seemed more determined to remain in touch with himself , to admit that the classic republic might be a lost tradition . Before the war ended , a moment would come in London , April 1945 , when stout , ruddy , English-looking Wilson , in Europe for The New Yorker and in a war correspondent 's uniform , feted by his English publisher at a grand party to which all the English literati came to do Wilson honor , would grumble to me , his fellow countryman , how much he distrusted the damned English . He was more horrified by the war than ever , for he had seen the ruins in England , Italy , and Greece . At our first encounter in 1942 Wilson seemed , in his abstract style of political discourse , the very type of gifted American crank , a heroic crank in the fiercely uncompromising style of the John Jay Chapman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scion of Abolitionists , essayist and scholar , who burned his hand off in repentance at striking a man of whom he was jealous , rejoiced in America 's entry into the " Great War , " and repaid his son 's death and his own disillusionment by supporting the Ku Klux Klan and the most nationalist prejudices . The immense historical sense behind Wilson 's criticism , architectural in its disposition of detail , would for me always represent personal sensibility rather than political shrewdness . But this same flinty old American self-trust was his flair , his style , his enormous charm for me . That afternoon I met him , he dismissed my book to my face , after having summoned me . Yet though everything showed him in a state of profound general irritability , he impressed me as much as his books had there was that slightly seedy independence , that essential and matter-of-fact seriousness . He looked like a man who had been built for thought ? and nothing else . With his round bald head and that hoarse , heavily breathing voice box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath , Wilson recomposed every bad-tempered feeling he felt that afternoon into explicit printable phrases . In a voice which like a deaf man 's suggested some despair of ever connecting with the outside world , he nevertheless bent down to every thought like a watchmaker looking through his lens . He stammeringly , with immense effort , always made his way to the point he wanted to make . Evidently he saw no need to smooth his way ? or mine : he had business in hand . He was naturally , pressingly occupied , like the railway president with overcoat user his arm and blueprint rolled up in his hand whose statue used to stand in the old Pennsylvania Station as a monument to the energy of American executives . One felt about Wilson that he got up in the morning thinking , that he went through the day in thought , and w eat to bed , whether or not he had cleared up the matter in hand , with the knowledge that atleast he had pursued it all day . Many years later , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal white shirt to the beach , he replied , " I have only one way of dressing . " At the moment he seemed to have only one way of discussing a book , whether or not the author was present , and I was it . He had summoned me to hear his opinion of my book , and I heard it . He was brief and conclusive . He was not much interested in it . Then the afternoon took a strange turn , Wilson had been merely impatient with my book . Mary McCarthy was much more thorough . She went into my faults with great care . Since her brilliance in putting down friends , enemies , and various idols of the tribe was already known to me from her stories in Partisan Review and our previous meeting at Provincetown in 1940 , I was fascinated by her zeal . She warmed to her topic with positive delight ; she looked beautiful in the increasing crispness of her analysis . Yet although their intellects were both so severe , Wilson expressed himself with comparative hesitancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes he had made in a story , " Ellen Terhune , " that was to become part of Memoirs of Hecate County . At this point Mary McCarthy , strangely taking my word for it , irritably reminded Wilson that she had warned him of this . He looked rueful , Mary McCarthy 's bite and spirit were now getting directed toward Wilson , but Wilson himself was silent . his topic was the book I had written , and when he had given me his observations and asked me the questions he had in mind , it was time for me to go home . Later , when I came to know him better and to realize that he was as sensitive as anyone else to criticism , I realized that in my inexperience I had underestimated the effect of my admiring but critical section on him , my ignorant participation in The New Republic after be had departed from it in rage , his outrage at the war 's leaving him in a corner ? and his conflicts with his wife . He suddenly realized how unprepared I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door grinningly advised me : " Write about her some time ! " When I went down the stairs in depression , he followed and said he would walk part of the way with me . A hard rain came on as we were crossing Third Avenue under the El . Wilson was suddenly talking about Joyce , worrying over the cabman 's shelter scene in Ulysses . We were standing directly under the El , the rain bounding off the tracks right on our heads , but he was absorbed in analyzing the scene and did not seem to see the irony in saying " shelter " over and over at that moment . In that voice that was like no other voice I had ever heard , a voice made remarkable by the sounds of commotion behind it , a voice that was like an enormous effort to reach the world , Wilson finally , with all clue deliberation , made his point about the cabman 's shelter scene in Ulysses , looked up at the rain dropping down his face , gave me a friendly pat on the @ @ @ @ @ @
