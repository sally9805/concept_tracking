THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THAT matter-of-fact investment hanker who spends most of his weekends in the country has sent us another rural report . He writes , " The old back road that leads from my house to the village is at one point flanked for almost a mile by open potato fields , and , driving home from the store last Saturday morning , I was struck by the ugly litter of cans and bottles in the grass along that stretch . Particularly struck , I should say . I counted a dozen beer cans alone before I gave up in disgust . I was so disgusted that , for once , I decided to do something about it . I talked it over with my wife and she agreed , and after lunch we put a couple of baskets in the back of the station wagon and drove down to that stretch of road and went to work . It took us an hour and a half to clean it up . Then we drove home . and unloaded the car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret our findings . I shall simply list what we found . A total of two hundred and forty-seven items , of which one hundred and fifty-nine were cans and eighty-eight were bottles . Fifty-three of the bottles were beer bottles , twenty-six were soda bottles , and nine were miscellaneous bottles . The brands of beer represented were : Schaefer ( 311 bottles ) , Miller High Life ( 9 ) , Ballantine ( 7 ) , Budweiser ( 4 ) , Rheingold ( 2 ) , and Ruppert Knickerbocker ( 1 . ) . The soda bottles were : Coca-Cola ( 13 ) , Pepsi-Cola ( 5 ) , Mission Orange ( 5 ) , Hires Root Beer ( 2 ) , and Canada Dry Cream Soda ( 1 ) . The other bottles were Hiram Walker Imperial ( 2 ) and one each of Bacardi Rum , Four Roses , Smirnoff Vodka , Gallo Thunderbird Wine , Vita Herring Party Snacks in Wine Sauce ( a jar , really ) , Kraft Apple Jelly ( another jar ) , and Heinz Tomato Ketchup .

After completing our inventory , we stowed the collection away ( in two fifty-gallon oil drums ) for the trash man . The trash man would take it to the dump . But then whatP And then what ? And then what ? " Bird Preservation . AFEW weeks ago , we made our way to the Pacific Bird Hall of the Museum of Natural History for a black-tie dinner given by the International Council for Bird Preservation ( United States Section ) , at which the Council 's first Delacour Medal , struck in honor of Jean Delacour , the famous French-born naturalist and a former I.C.B.P. president , was presented to Konrad Lorenz , the famous Austrian animal behaviorist . Milling around during the cocktail hour , in some cases with their wives , were Gardner D. Stout , the Museum 's president ; Dr. S. Dillon Ripley , the Council 's president and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution ; Alexander Wetmore , a Secretarial predecessor of his , who has been writing about birds since the nineteen-twenties ; James A. Oliver , the Museum 's Coiirdinator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general director of the New York Zoological Society ; and Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith , the editor of the A vicultural Magazine , of Great Britain . " 1 . Ve were seventy-five years old last year , " she said . " I flew over for the dinner . I 've become a member of the international jet set . " Following the dinner , Mr. G. Stuart Keith , a Museum authority on African birds , who serves as the Council 's American secretary , delivered a welcoming speech ; Dr. Ripley paid tribute to Mr. Delacour ( " How vigorous and excited Jean was about birds  --  as he is today  --  when I first met him , thirty-five years ago ! " ) , whose medal bears on its obverse the likeness of an imperial pheasant , a species that Mr. Delacour discovered in Indo-China , and on its reverse a likeness of Mr. Delacour ; and Dr. Dean Amadon , the Museum 's ornithology chief and an expert on hawks , bestowed the medal . " He made the simple discovery that the way to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of its recipient , Dr. Lorenz , who launched into the evening 's talk , on the relation of animal behavior to human behavior . Wanting to find out more about our institutional host , we lunched , a while later , with Mr. Keith and Dr. Amadon , who is its American vice-chairman . " Roger Tory Peterson is chairman , but he 's always away travelling , " Dr. Amadon said . " We 're a complex organization , with chapters in seventy countries . Our object is to promote the conservation of birdg on an international basis . Our chapters , or national sections , have individual members and member societies ; the member societies in the United States include the American Museum , the National Audubon Society , and the American Ornithologist ? Union . International meetings are held every four years . The next one , to he held this September , will be on Texel  --  an island in Holland that is a breeding ground for sea birds . I think we have some tangible accomplishments . We 've set up a crane sanctuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japan . Cranes used to spend the winter there , and they arc beginning to again . " " We have good key people in various countries , " Mr. Keith said . " The ? head of our Japanese section , Dr. Yoshimaro Yamashina , is a cousin of the Emperor . We have n't much money , but some things can he done without money . In western Panama last year , I noted that the quetzal , an enormous trogon , was dying nut , because of the chopping down of the forests . Our Panamanian representative advised me to write to various Panamanian government departments and personages on I.C.B.P , stationery , I sent letters to , among others , the President of Panama and the Minister of Tourism , suggesting that the threatened area be made into a national park . I said it was hound to get lots of visitors . A month later , I received a reply front die head of a committee for the preservation of natural resources , to whom my letters had been referred . He said that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorably considered . Well , wait and see . " " It 's important to stress income from tourists , " Dr. Amadon said . " Pollution is the bandwagon today . DDT has been banned or greatly restricted in this country , but there is no ban on sell-AMAN we know works in the New York office of a large national firm , and he recently had occasion to examine the confidential file on an employee who had just been transferred from the Los Angeles office . The Personal Summary read as follows : Hard , conscientious worker , but no mixer , so scope probably limited . Does not participate in company-sponsored activities and has no close friends among office associates , who consider hint " standoffish . " In three years here never visited Disneyland . Newspapers THE conventional wis- dom about starting newspapers in New York City is that it ca n't he done . During the nineteen-sixties , the number of daily papers of general circulation here dropped from seven to three ; the " death toll , " to use a time-honored city-room phrase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tozdrnal-Americas , and  --  most sorely missed  --  the Herald Tribune . Then , after the collapse of that three-headed hybrid the World I ? land Tribune , in 1967 , a number of corporate entities , among them the Times , the News , and Time Inc. , spent considerable sums persuading themselves that the cost of setting up a new paper would he " prohibitive . " All this time , of course , a much larger num-ber of non-corporate entities ( mostly kids with something radical , obscene , or otherwise provocative to say ) were busying themselves setting up dozens of weekly , biweekly , and monthly " un-dergnaind " newspapers  --  a phenome-non made possible by the development of cheap techniques of composition and offset printing . It was only a matter of time before someone would get the idea of putting together the economics of underground newspapers and the lin-gering desire for more daily journal-ism in New York . Last week , word of two new projects along this line reached us , and we went to visit their young authors . Both of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both will he tabloid size , both will be staffed mostly by people under thirty , and both will be printed by job printers on photo-offset presses , but beyond that , it turned out , the divergences will he wide . One of the new papers , the Daily Planet , proposes to become the first offbeat daily , pitching its appeal not only to followers of the conventional papers but to those who now read the Village Voice , the East Village Other , Rat , Other Scenes , or nothing at all . The other new paper , to he called Weekday , plans to concentrate on straight , solid local-news coverage , mostly of neighborhoods that it believes have been neglected by the existing dailies . We went first to see Michael C. Lucktnan , co-founder of the Daily Planet , at his office , in the New School for Social Research , where he is assistant director of public information . A pear-shaped man of twenty-seven with long black hair , which he wears tucked behind his ears , Mr. Luck-man told us that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done publicity for such causes as birth control , the peace movement , and Biafran independence . We asked Mr. Luckman to tell is what the Daily Planet would he like . " We 're Fretty much into the McLuhan hag , " he said . " Our layout will be a total experience of sensory bombardment with images and words . We 're not going to use A.P . or U.P.I. We might use Reuters and Agence France-Presse , and , of course , we 'll use L.N.S. , the Liberation News Service . ' We 'll cover the arts that are in the streets and in lofts , not just at Lincoln Center and in the Museum of Modern Art . We 'll have a direct line to student , anti-war , black , and women's-liberation groups . We 'll he anti-Establishment , but that 's all you can label us . We 're not going to follow any party line . We 'll have sixty full-time employees and a hundred contributing editors , running the gamut from liberal to revolutionary . " " Anyone in particular ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you any names right now , but we 're working on them , " he replied . " You 'd recognize the names . " We asked about the financial picture , and Mr. Luckman said , " We 're aiming for early September as our date to begin publication . The budget for the first year will approach two million dollars , and we 'll need less than half of that before we start . With a circulation of a hundred thousand , we can break even . Frankly , I do n't see how a paper like ours can miss . " " Why are you calling it the Daily Planet ? " " Because we 're going to report everything that 's happening on this planet every day . The other reason is that we represent truth , justice , and the American way . " We got up . " Incidentally , are you concerned about competition from Weekday ? " we asked . " Weekday ? " Mr. Lockman said . " Mirror , mirror on the wall , who is the fairest judge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think we have anything to worry about . " In an apartment on West End Aye-ma. , we met James A. Smith , who is twenty-two years old and is the president of Weekday Publications , Inc . Mr. Smith has already founded several publications , and he told us that the difficulty of starting newspapers has been exaggerated . " People think you need your own presses , rows of linoty-pe machines , hot metal , a skyscraper , and a fleet of trucks with your name on them , " he said . " Actually , with the kind of technology that 's available now , putting out a newspaper is n't such an awesome task . When people realize that , they wo n't have so much respect for the printed word . They 'll begin to see that nothing should be unquestioned . " " Where 's the money coming from ? " we asked . " Mostly from business associates of my father , " he said . " Actually , we 'll need only about a hundred thousand to begin operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " MI- . Smith handed us a piece of paper covered with figures . We glanced at it and noticed that he planned to pay his reporters an average of two hundred and twenty-five dollars a week . " We could support the paper without any advertising at all if we had a circulation of a hundred and twenty thousand , and even at fifty thousand our losses would he only a thousand dollars a day  --  on our schedule , that would be twenty thousand a month . " We asked what Weekday will look like , and Mr. Smith handed us the dummy issue . It was hefty  --  forty-eight pages  --  and it had a makeup that was conservative without being oppressively serious . The four columns of type on each page were set flush left but nut flush right . " Madison Avenue caught on long ago to the fact that lines of uneven length attract readers . The paper will he composed on typewriters just like that one , " lie said , pointing to an I.B.M . Executive on his desk . " What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vacuum in this town is for a specifically New York newspaper , not a national newspaper that happens to operate nut of Manhattan . I 'm fairly far left of center , but We , ' kitty wo n't have an editorial page . All an editorial page would do is give people an excuse to dismiss our news coverage  --  and on that you should talk with our city editor , Allan Wolper . " " One more thing , " we said . " Are you worried about competition from the Daily PlarielF " " They think we 're terribly bourgeois , " said Mr. Smith , who wears his hair short and his glasses horn-rimmed . " Actually , objective reporting is the most radical thing there is . " We found Mr. Wolper at the offices of Channel 13 , the educational television station , where he is associate producer of " Newsfront , " the nightly news broadcast . Mr. Wolper , a bearlike man of thirty-one , is a former political reporter for the Associated Press . He told us that he would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to get guys who have been in New York for a while , " he sa:d . " Guys who know how to report , and who also wo n't mind getting up in front of a P.-T.A. meeting or a Lions Club or some other community group and making a speech about the paper . Guys who know where Riverdale is . I 'm going to buy borough flags and hang them up in the city room to remind these guys they 're not prima donnas . " Mr. Wolper leaned forward in his chair . " New York City is divided into five boroughs , " he said , in a tone that suggested he would tolerate no nonsense . " For many years , no one has known that . There is a Tremont Avenue in the Bronx There is a Sixty-ninth Road in Queens . There is a Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn . There is something called the lower Fast Side , as opposed to the East Village . This is my credo . " Service APUNCTUAL career woman of our acquaintance who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Sixties , overlooking Fifth Avenue , tells us that she long since stopped winding the alarm clock that stands on her bedside table , and rises each morning with a sense of well-being in answer to the crowing of a rooster in the Children 's Zoo , far below , ? AN introspective friend , on the other hand , tells us that he feels shakier than usual as the result of a letter from Sears , Roebuck hearing the number 141234 and the salutation " Dear Preferred Customer . " Automation House pART of the enchantment of Paris I in the twenties , as Scott Fitzgerald once remarked , was that everything that happened there seemed to have something to do with art . Although New York in the seventies is hardly likely to evoke the same sort of enchantment , one does get the feeling sometimes that art here is simply inescapable . The notion assailed us with particular force the other evening when we went to the opening of Automation House , the new home of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment , the Institute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Community Disputes . Instead of institutional d6cor and foundation furnishings , we found ourself surrounded by  --  of course 1 ? the familiar dazzle and pop of electronic art . In Automation House , the handsome brownstone at 49 East Sixty-eighth Street , which was formerly part of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations , three of the six floors were given over to an electronically activated show called " The Magic Theatre " and consisting of eight " environments " devised by eight artists . Sidling across a platform pocked with strobe-lit portholes , we made our way toward a black curtain , and , luckily , emerged into an art-free room where Theodore W. Kilt-el , the professional arbitrator and mediator , and the moving spirit behind Automation House , genially took us in tow . Mr. Kheel , who has close-cropped black hair , rugged good looks , and a reassuring voice , told us that " The Magic Theatre " is being sponsored jointly by the Museum of Contemporary Crafts and Automation House , which is one of the very few buildings in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Museum was looking for a place to install the show , and it sounded like a natural for our opening , so we took it , " he said . In a few minutes of brisk conversation with Mr. Kheel , we learned that he had set up the American Foundation on Automation and Employment hack in 1962 , after finding that swim of the labor-management disputes he was called on to mediate came down in essence to changes as a result of automation . " %V pooped along for several years , and got out a few hooks and studies , " he said . " Then , in 1967 , the Foundation was able to buy this house  --  it had been saved from demolition a couple of years before that by the Marquess de Cuevas , who also bought the two houses adjoining -- and we set out to make it a multipurpose place that would demonstrate the ability of the new technology to help individuals and to solve problems . The renovations cost more than a million dollars , ) Are started them a little- before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got finished a little after it did . It 's pretty phenomenal . We 've got enough electrical wiring in here to light the Waldorf-Astoria . The place is completely wired for closed-circuit it television , so anybody in any of the looms can he plugged into what 's going on in other room . We 'll also be able to do live telecasts from lucre over national hookups . I sec it mainly as a conference center now , a place where all sorts of people can get together and air their troubles  --  not only management and labor but community and city groups , too . Last week , for example , the Young Lords came here to iron out their differences with the First Spanish Methodist Church in East Harlem . The great thing is that we 're flexible . THE NEW YORKER 31 " Damn it , sir , are you aware of the fact that I made an eight-o'clock reservation for two at half pass ten this morning " We can go in just about any direction we want . " " Including art exhibitions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " The way that came about was sort of interesting . I do n't have any knowledge of or background in art , but about three or four years ago I was introduced to Bill ) Kluver , a young scientist who used to be at Bell Labs . Kluver and the artist Robert Rauschenberg had a nonprofit organization called Experiments in Art and Technology , which was designed to promote contacts between artists interested in using new Technological materials and methods and the engineers who worked with those things . Experiments in Art and Technology  --  or EAT , as they refer to it  --  was having one of its periodic financial crises , and they thought I might be able to help . Kluver , Rauschenberg , and I had Lunch together , and before the meal was over , I realized that there was an identity of purpose between us . We were all interested in using technology to help the individual , and we were all aware of the immense frustration that people feel when they ca n't participate in the new technology , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things , and then , when my foundation bought this house , we invited EAT to become one of the participating organizations , and they accepted . Kluver and Rauschenberg have been very helpful in developing the concepts for the building , which will also be a place for artists to work in and exhibit in . Actually , our biggest problem here was persuading the builders to make it flexible enough . And architects can create problems . They want to know just what a particular space is going to he used for where to put the Xerox machine , and all that I kept saying that we did n't know how the space was going to he used , and that what I wanted was options . Thomas Lehrecke and Joseph Tonetti were the architects who finally made it work , and we managed to get the Tishman Realty &; Construction Co. , which rarely takes on a project this small , to do the actual renovation . I think it 's worked out pretty well , ton . " A wave of art-numbed guests claimed Kheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonetti , He told us that working with Kheel had been a lot of fun , and that
