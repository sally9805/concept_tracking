The two scholars picked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences last week to share the $125,000 Nobel Prize in Economics have many things in common . Sweden 's Gunnar Myrdal and Austrian-born , British-naturalized Friedrich A. von Hayek are both , at 75 , still vigorously writing and teaching as visiting professors - Myrdal at the City College of New York and Von Hayek at Salzburg University . Both men achieved early recognition , as the academy noted , " for their pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations . " And both gained their widest audiences by going beyond the economist 's blackboard model building to produce analyses of modern society through a broad and erudite multidisciplinary approach . <P> Longtime Gladiator . There , for the most part , the similarities end . A longtime gladiator in the public arena , Myrdal served in the Swedish Parliament in the 1930s and was an impor tant architect of the Swedish Labor Party 's welfare state . He was his country 's Commerce Minister from 1945 to 1947 and head of the United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a considerably more familiar figure than his fellow laureate , largely because of two major works published nearly a quarter-century apart . While a professor at the Uni versity of Stockholm , Myrdal carried out extensive research in the U.S. to pro duce his classic An American Dilemma ( 1944 ) . It interwove economics and sociology in arriving at its conclusion that white America had dangerously betrayed its ideals in its treatment of blacks . With Psychologist Kenneth Clark , Myrdal is now at work on a follow-up study . <P> In 1968 , after a decade of research ( much of it carried out while his wife Alva was Swedish Ambassador to India ) , he published what he called his " labor of love . " Asian Drama : An Inquiry Into the Poverty of Nations pointed up , in 2,500 pages , the economic , political and social factors that impede progress in the world 's most populous area . An apostle of thoroughgoing Swedish-style planning , Myrdal is a socialist who became in the late 1960s-though professing a sincere affection for the U.S. <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Southeast Asia . <P> By contrast , Von Hayek , an old-fashioned economic liberal , has been more the traditional professor . Since 1931 he has taught at the Universities of London , Chicago ( from which he retired at the age of 63 ) and Freiburg and has often lectured in Japan . A student of business cycles and one of the few economists to foresee the 1929 crash , he was cited by the academy for his work on the relative efficiency of different types of economic systems . The system that he has criticized most is the one advocated by Myrdal . In his 1944 international bestseller , The Road to Serfdom , Von Hayek warned that centralized planning , however idealistic , inexorably leads to the loss of freedom . <P> In a pluralistic world , there is room fof such disparate thinkers as Myrdal and Von Hayek and for the opposite courses to human fulfillment that they espouse . By honoring these two economists simultaneously , the Swedish Academy has cast a quiet vote for the world of diversity .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
