txt State and local taxes on business are soaring . That 's hardly a surprise , but this may be : In the 1970s , they are n't likely to shoot up as frantically as they have in the recent past . Experts say that spending by states and localities is slowing , though it still romps well ahead of overall economic growth . And the states and localities , though taxing business as never before , are relying more heavily on taxes that hit individuals the hardest . Thus , business will probably provide a declining share of total state and local taxes in coming years . If the rash of new taxes and higher taxes on business is indeed about to ease , on , e reason is that the states made last year their biggest tax-writing binge on record . Because of lackluster tax collections from a slow economy , the states put more than $5 billion in new or higher taxes on the books . That round amounted to a 10% increase in overall collections . Not all of that burden fell on business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states boosted rates on corporate income taxes . After fierce political fights , two long-time holdouts  --  Florida and Ohio  --  became the 44th and 45th states to levy corporate income taxes . Three or four years ago , Sperry Rand Corp . budgeted 4 5% as the average state corporate income rate . Recently , the company boosted the planning figure to 6%  --  a 33% increase in less than four years . No Longer Insignificant Some businessmen have shrugged off state income taxes as insignificant , but in many states that 's no longer true . Minnesota raised its rate to 12% last year , Pennsylvania is at 11% , and Ohio 's new tax was pegged at 8% . New York State levies 9% , and New York City adds 6.7% , to make a total of 15.7% for a corporation in New York City . The states and localities are pressing other measures , too . Minnesota no longer allows corporations to deduct federal taxes on their state return . Kentucky recently took the same step . Many tax jurisdictions are repealing certain exemptions from sales taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chairman of ACF Industries Inc. , state and local taxes are the company 's fastest growing cost . They are going up about 20% a year . Then why expect any let-up ? For one thing , states and localities may no longer be as desperate for new taxes as is commonly believed . Elsie M. Watters , director of state and local research for the Tax Foundation , a nonprofit research group , disputes the conventional view that spending by states and localities has badly outstripped their ability to raise money . " If you sty it enough , everybody believes it , " she declares , but she does n't believe it . Tax Foundation projections for the 1970s do n't predict a rosy financial future , but they do n't point to a fiscal crisis either . The foundation reckons that taxes already on the books would raise enough in the 1970s to cover anticipated spending by state and local governments and even leave a slight surplus . " Imaginative Minds " By Miss Watters ' calculations , the present revenue structure , without tax increases or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in 1980 , up from $130.76 billion in 1970 . She also projects an increase in state and local spending from $131.33 billion in 1970 to $309.27 billion in 1980 , or $14 billion less than anticipated revenues . Obviously the foundation 's projections do n't mean a moratorium on tax increases . " We can be certain that as surpluses threaten , imaginative minds will find abundant ways to spend them , " Miss Watters declares . But the prcijections do suggest that the state and local revenue structure will be under less strain . According to the Tax Foundation , the explosive growth in spending by states and localities is over . Such outlays spurted as much as 14% annually in recent years , twice as fast as the overall economy . That spending rate should fall back to 10% in the first half of the 1970s and to 8% after that , the foundation figures . For the first time in decades , school enrollments should level off . Also , the " exorbitant " increases in welfare spending ( more than 1SS ' , , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while taxes are going up , those that fall mainly on business are going up more slowly than others . That promises tax relief for business at least compared with what Individuals pay . The property tax , a major item on a company 's tax bill , is steadily dechnirg in importance . It remains the single biggest revenueproducer ( $41.31 billion last year ) , but it now accounts for only one-quarter of total state and local monies . Ten years ago , it accounted for one-third . " A Bit From Everyone " All signs are that the decline of the property tItx will continue . In fact , a string of recent court decisions , if sustained , could force a wholesale reordering of school finances , with uncertain consequences for business . It could mean statewide property taxes , rather than local , but it would also likely mean greater reliance on income or sales levies to finance schools . By contrast , income taxes on individuals are the fastest-growing money-maker for states and localities . hsat year , collections jumped 14% and pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local taxes . Corporate income tax collections came to only $3.43 billion and actually declined 4.2% fram the year before . The levies on - individuals are becoming steadily more important . In 1960 , they accounted for 6.8% of all state and local taxes ; by 1970 , the figure was 12.5% , and the Tax Foundation expects nearly 18% by 1980 . ( Of course a big slice of U.S. business  --  unincorporated businesses  --  pay taxes on their profits at individual rates . ) Corporations Do n't Complain Much Interviews with the tax managers of some of the nation 's largest corporations turn up little of the passion that individuals vent about higher taxes these days . Taxes are going up , but apparently the corporate people do n't feel squeezed . At a recent Tax Foundation conference on business and state and local taxes , scarcely a participant bothered to inveigh against higher taxes . " When a state has a deficit , the money 's got to come from somewhere , " one executive says . " Usually it comes a bit from everyone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deductible on federal returns , and this cushions the blow , they say . Also , many businessmen seem satisfied that , eventually at least , tax increases are passed along to customers in the form of higher prices . " The biggest problem , " says Robert Boehike , tax manager at Swift &; Co. , " is being able to determine in advance what our tax liability is going to be so we can price cur products accordingly . In fact , businessmen seem more concerned mat state and local taxes are uneven than that they are higa . Businessmen do n't like to pay taxes that do n't fall on their competitors , too . They also get highly perturbed venen short-o. market conditions don t permit a price increase to pass along a higher tax . But differences in taxes on business from arie state to another also seem overrated . Some states do acquire a reputation as tough taxers . For inseance , according to Arthur E. Hauser , director of taxes at U.S. Steel Corp , California has " probably the worst tax climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there Ise would save a lot of money . " But corporate tax people also say tax differences are rarely decisive in deciding plant locations . " It 's not really true that people flee to lower tax jurisdictions , " says Wallace J Clarfield , vice president for taxes at Olin Corp Taxes are a factor , but access to markets , raw materials and labor is usually much more important . " You 'd probably move to Texas if other things were the same , " says John Wood , tax manager for J. C. Penney Co. , " but of course they never are . " These days some companies are more upset with state revenuers than with state lawmakers . By all accounts , the states have markedly stepped up their auditing , in particular checking up on the huge out-of-state companies doing business in their states . " We are experiencing more audits than at any other time in our history , " says Paul Reck of Sperry Rand . At least six states have New York City offices for easier access to corporate giants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that me whole compliance warder- Is all out of proportion , " comp'a'rs one corporate executive . who asks anonymity . He cis s it may cost his company more to compile and tile a monthly sales tax return , for instance , than the tax due . States and localities , anxious for their money , are less willing to Malt for quarterly or annual returns . How much can be squeezed out of auditing ? California , ar . early leader , clearly finds It tvorUa.lsae The state figures it gets $9.87 an additional corporate taxes for each dollar it spends on auditing . California has two New York City offices , with about 70 people , and another in Chicago . The three offices are " perhaps our biggest producers , " says James Moram , supervisor of corporate audits for the state .
