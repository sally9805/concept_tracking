CORRESPONDENTS who have been covering West Africa describe the chaotic conditions there with the acronym WAWA , meaning " West Africa Wins Again . " To the newsmen scrambling to cover the sudden collapse of the breakaway state of Biafra , last week was WAWA and then some . At the moment of victory for Nigeria , the nearest TIME Correspondent was James Wilde , 1,000 miles away in Kinshasa , the Congo . He could just as well have been on the moon . Defeated by bureaucracy and the vagaries of travel in Africa , Wilde was forced to assess the situation on the basis of long experience in the war and previous interviews with Biafran Leader Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu . <P> Nevertheless , TIME was well represented at the week 's biggest story . East African Correspondent John Blashill was in Addis Ababa when the word came ; it took him 30 hours to cover over 6,000 miles to Lagos , through Athens , Geneva and London . In from Paris flew Roland Flamini , and he and Blashill pieced together a thorough report on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondents who attempted the 36-hour drive to Enugu , the original secessionist capital , were turned back by Nigerian army roadblocks . In Lagos , government officials refused to see newsmen at all . Nevertheless , Blashill managed an exclusive 45-minute interview with a top Nigerian official . " He kept saying he really had to go , " recalls Blashill . " But he kept on talking . I found out later that he was supposed to be with General Gowon at the peace talks in which the Biafrans formally surrendered . " <P> Half the job was getting the news out . " The public telex office was jammed day and night , " reported Flamini . " The overloaded wires became more erratic with frequent breakdowns and wrong numbers . One correspondent waited hours , only to discover that he had transmitted his entire story to a Scandinavian machine-tool factory with a call sign similar to that of his paper . " Eventually TIME 'S team got their report over the wires to New York . Their files , along with Jim Wilde 's in Nairobi , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spencer Davidson , edited by Ronald Kriss and researched by Marion Knox . <P> The Cover : Photographic design by Fred Burrell , who utilized a dramatically lit wood-and-polychrome Ibo mask .
