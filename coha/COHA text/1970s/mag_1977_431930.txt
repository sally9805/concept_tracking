 | THE CAPITALIST PARADOX The populace may hiss me , but when I go home and think of my money , I applaud myself . ? Horace , 25 B.C. ON RESIGNING as a trustee of the Ford Foundation in January of this year , Mr. Henry Ford II took the trouble to write a letter giving vent to his confusion , annoyance , and dismay . The newspapers published passages from the letter and made prominent news of the fact that he found it necessary to remind the staff of the foundation that it was associated with " a creature of capitalism . " Things apparently had come to such a dismal state of mutual embarrassments that Mr. Ford felt obliged to apologize for his use of the word capitalism . Conceding that the word might seem " shocking " to many of the people employed in the vineyards of philanthropy , Mr. Ford proceeded to his defense of the old ways and old order : I 'm not playing the role of the hardheaded tycoon who thinks all philanthropoids are Socialists and all university professors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the staff that the sys. tern that makes the foundation possible very probably is worth preserving . Alas , poor Henry Ford . All that money , all those good intentions squandered on a crowd of pious fools and the search for social conscience . He must have wondered what had become of the labor riots of his youth , and the general recognition that capitalism presupposes a norm , if not of violence , at least of unremitting strife . His letter had a forlorn sound to it , ? as if Mr. Ford knew that it would be ignored , or , more probably , received with the thin and distant smiling of people who know themselves to stand on the side of righteous principle . McGeorge Bundy , the foundation 's president and , as one of the chancellors of the Vietnam war , a man well versed in the use of the explanatory phrase , declined to be drawn into an exchange of views . " There really was n't a blow-up , " he told the press . " There is neither more nor less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further comment on an occasion ripe with the chance of portentous meaning , Mr. Bundy elaborated his remark as follows : Lewis H. Lapham is the editor of Harper's. 31  | " One of the things we 've always valued about Henry Ford is candor . " The times had changed , and Mr. Ford might as well have tried to explain himself to the wandering disciple of an alien roshi . The paradoxes implicit in the system of capitalist enterprise have become increasingly distasteful to the men who , like Mr. Bundy , preside over the formulation of enlightened opinion . The politics of the age , in its literary and academic as well as its governmental forms , tends toward earnest simplification . Hardly anybody likes to admit that the highest achievements of the Western mind spring from the same soils that nourish the lush flowerings of corruption and greed . On the one hand the capitalist system implies the exploitation of any available weakness , but on the other hand it encourages the freedom of thought and experiment . The two genies emerge from the same bottle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , in the same week that the usual number of public officials were rounded up on the usual suspicions of fraud , seven Americans received the Nobel Prize . A cautionary tale THIS IS A PARADOX of which I 'm reminded at least twice a week by observers of the contemporary scene who pass in and out of the office with the surfeit of bad news . They present me with evidence of graft in Washington or St. Louis ; they offer proofs of price-fixing in the oil or aircraft industries ; they bring word of illegal campaign contributions , of pay-offs , bribes , and stock-market swindles . While I am sympathetic to the suffering inflicted on the victims of these crimes , I can not help but be surprised by the innocence of my informants , who , when I fail to respond to their news with what they judge to be appropriate expressions of rage and alarm , tax me with indifference to the wickedness of the world . I take for granted Jefferson 's dictum that money , not morality , constitutes the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point I was relieved of them by an old and accomplished entrepreneur with whom I once spent several days in a house overlooking the sea . He was then a man in his seventies , wheezing and sly , married to a woman much younger than himself who sent him postcards from Paris and Antibes . He had undergone major surgery that spring and did n't expect to live through the autumn . " She 'll marry a novelist , " he said , " and they 'll talk about the unimportance of money . " We sat on deck chairs , listening to the crying of gulls . The view of the horizon moved him to a series of last meditations on the nature of a successful business deal . As a young man he had inherited , together with his brother , a large and prosperous drug company . Shortly after World War II he had grasped the possibilities of what later came to be known as the multinational corporation , and he traveled through the poorer countries of the world setting up dependent subsidiaries . " Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and avoid doing business in democracies . They 're unstable . The trouble with them is that you have to bribe too many people , most of them at least twice . If something goes wrong . somebody to whom you just paid $10,000 stands up in whatever they call the Congress in those places and makes a speech about American exploitation . Nobody stays bought . " Most of all , he liked to tell his story about the Muslim state in which both partners agreed to take 100 percent profit from their enterprise . For a few years the owners of the subsidiary were satisfied with this division of spoils , but then they began to think that maybe 100 percent was n't enough , that maybe the Aladdin 's lamp of twentieth-century technology entitled them to 200 percent . Having no wish to disturb the American corporation , they proposed to increase the price to their own people . The Minister of Health objected to this for humanitarian reasons , and for a period of several months nothing could be done . The prospect of negotiation improved when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendectomy . Soon after he arrived on the operating table , the surgeons informed him that the hospital had exhausted its supplies of anesthetic . They were terribly sorry , of course , but there appeared to be some difficulty about the cost of manufacturing morphine . The surgeon apologized for the inconvenience while holding the point of a knife to the minister 's belly , explaining further that the pain of incision would be so great as to put the minister into a state of shock , which , although momentarily unpleasant , would in itself be a kind of anesthetic . The minister agreed to the rise in price . The story was presented to me as a fable or a cautionary tale , and whenever the old man arrived at the moral of it he would be seized by a fit of choking laughter , slapping weakly at his knee in a gesture meant to convey dramatic emphasis . " By God , " he would say , " that 's what business is all about . " He died in October , and his wife married an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREATER or lesser extent we are all greedy and ' frightened children , and if the possession of money comes to mean the difference between life and death , then how is it possible to blame people for whatever they do to obtain it ? The history of American business is shot through with incidents of theft , graft , and fraud . The revisionist historians who delight in the obviousness of this , and who seek to make of their discoveries a theory of consistently evil intent , neglect to mention the other genie in the bottle . There is also the history of American invention in the arts and sciences . The two traditions oppose one another , and to ignore the competition between them is to belittle the striving of the human spirit . Although a capitalist society pays huge sums of money for the popular imitations of art or truth , it seldom can recognize , much less reward , its greatest genius . It allows people to stumble into visions of their own truth because it considers such visions irrelevant . In a totalitarian society the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state and therefore lead inevitably to the offices of the secret police ; in a capitalist society they lead into the obscurity of a small room where Herman Melville sits writing prose or out onto the waters of Great Peconic Bay , where Einstein drifts in a sailboat and wonders about the refraction of light . Given the American capacity for transforming anything and everything into an article of merchandise , nobody can escape the seductions or the intimidations of money . That so many people refuse the offers and resist the threats testifies to their larger understanding of the character of human life . They make their choices not so much on moral grounds as on the basis of empirical observation , because the obsession with money , as witness the long and unhappy life of Howard Hughes , reduces a man to the gibbering sycophancy of a frightened ape . The Ten Commandments stand as the precursor to Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights . The mind tries to free itself from the confusions of murder and lust because it seeks the greater excitements of courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money becomes clear in the perspective of time . Who can remember last year 's tycoon ? Who can name the ten most powerful men in St. Joseph , Missouri , in 1845 ? When I read the list of names published in the pages of New York magazine ( " The Power Brokers , " " The Men , Who Really Count , " et cetera ) I think of the patrons and donors disguised as Magi who stand around in the foreground of Renaissance religious painting . They peer at the Madonna with the same anxious obscurity of Henry hi -- singer staring into the camera of a photographer from Women 's Wear Daily . They ha e paid for the space , and they hope to be introduced to the best people in heaven . Over the course of time it has been the power of the spirit and the imagination that has shaped the clay of civilization . The greatness of man expresses itself in the force of mind , in Bach 's music or Shakespeare 's plays , in the art of da Vinci , the physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows with the baggage , traveling among camp followers and putting up the tents . It can maintain the status quo , whether of tyranny or democracy ; it can gild markets or temples , employ 400,000 automobile workers or Benvenuto Cellini , buy Panama or Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer . It is a power worth having , but without the greater power of thought it amounts to little more than the temporary dominion of a bully . If a price can be set on the worth of a man 's labor but not on the worth of his dreams or his hope of the future , then the mainspring of capitalism must rest on a paradox . In the realm of politics the paradox presents itself as a balance between the pressure for social justice and the inertia of greed . The shifting weight in this balance sustains as fair and equitable a redistribution of the wealth as seems to me possible in a society that tries to make an equation among creativity , profit , and survival . The election of each new administration , sometimes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Committee , gives rise to the creation of new wealth . During the several weeks prior to President Carter 's inauguration I was reminded of this by a series of conversations with people who hoped to improve both their own and the public interest . They spoke of better deals for the disaffected minorities , of innovative approaches to the troubles in Africa and the Middle East . But they also spoke of the public money moving in different directions , of industries and groups of industries that could expect to add to their net worth . Several of them had been offered places in the new government , but the chance to go to Washington had both assets and liabilities . In an otherwise unremarkable coffee shop on Seventh Avenue , in the midst of people talking about the miseries of the Broadway theater and the question of that Sunday 's Super Bowl game , I remember watching R. work out his accounting on a paper napkin . A small , unkempt man in his early middle age , a lawyer by profession , who ceaselessly searched his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | capitalist equation to two columns of numbers . " They would give me this or that , " he said . " Not anything particularly important , you understand ; enough for a title and a way into the Council on Foreign Relations . But it would cost me money to take the goddamn job , and I 'd be subject to the conflict-of-interest regulations . " He resented the obligation to sign the papers . He understood that the people who presided over the slaughterhouse do n't like to get too much blood on their clothes , but he thought it unfair of them to force the same hypocrisy on the hired help . I reminded him that he could take his files and write a book , that the people who work in the public sector sometimes can return to the private sector with their market value much improved . Having looked into the abyss into which it is given few men to look , their impressions , no matter how dishonest or indistinct , acquire the romance of travelers ' tales . Their advice and counsel make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembrances of things past sometimes command large sums in the publishing markets . " I do n't know Carter , " he said , " and with these people it wo n't be as easy as it was with Kennedy and Nixon . They do n't give anything away . " On reviewing his connections to other points in the administration he found himself acquainted with several prominent Senators for whom he had performed services useful enough to be remembered . He also knew at least four members of the new Cabinet . From each of these people he could expect favorable attentions . He could assume that they would answer his telephone calls , that they would listen to his opinion on matters of patronage , and that they would find time for appointments with whomever R. chose to endow with the appropriate credentials . Already he had received a number of inquiries , all of them discreet , from people who wanted to know if he could arrange a meeting with one of the new Secretaries . Did he know anybody who could modify the language of the trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee ? " If I 'm not greedy , " he said , " I figure I can make $250,000 in the first year . " Addition and subtraction LISTENING TO R. practice his anxious arithmetic , I understood that he was speaking to me as the true apologist of a republic that had managed to celebrate its Bicentennial year because it had @# found ways of buying off the opposition and . by so doing , of preserving the uneven balance between the possessed and the dispossessed . It occurred to me that creativity too often is defined along narrow and provincial lines , as if it were something associated only with the authors of first novels or with well-meaning ladies in Westport , Connecticut , making Mexican jewelry . The use of money releases enormous energies , as does the raising of houses or families and the writing of law . All creativity implies change and therefore damage . " War is the maker of all things , " said Heraclitus , thus stating the premise of capitalism . Not only do the combatants come forward with technological advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies come to be regarded ( most fondly by people who live after them and so escape their conscriptions 1 as heroic figures . Heroes trade at extremely high prices , both in blood and money , but they provide the models of behavior for subsequent generations of schoolboys . The three men generally admired as the greatest of American Presidents ? Washington , Lincoln , and Franklin D. Roosevelt ? also presided over America 's most necessary wars . I make these observations not so much to extol the virtues of capitalism as to understand the contradictory motions of its interlocking parts . If the morality inherent in money governs the workings of a commercial nation , then the stability of that nation depends upon a balance between the confusions of money and the clarity of mind . The confusion makes itself most plainly visible among people who believe in the omnipotence of money and who therefore lose the capacity to think . I suspect this is what happened to Richard Nixon . He had become so stupefied by the aura of money that he could n't destroy the tapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might represent , if properly edited and advertised , another $1 million . Although I feel sympathy for the man distracted by the promise of money , I become depressed or uneasy if required to stay long in his presence . The feeling has nothing to do with moral precepts . In the greenhouse atmosphere of inanimate wealth , my mind begins to sag with the heaviness of sleep . It is n't a matter of place . The arrangement of horses and lawns , or , the Impressionist view of the summer sea , does n't necessarily preclude the hope of consciousness . Neither is it a lack of cunning or connections . Somebody always knows somebody who owns something , whether a football team , a corporation , or an island in the Bahamas . The befuddlement of the rich follows from their single-minded staring into mirrors .  | Beneath the surfaces of their talk I sometimes hear , as if from an ominous distance , something akin to a thin and paranoid music , a sound like the rattling of bones or the voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having bought weapons worth $15 billion in the past four years . " The defense of Iran , " said the shah , " is above even history and time . The arms I choose . All systems I choose . " Or it is a sound like the rustling of leaves across stone courtyards , the whispering advice of McGeorge Bundy saying to President John Kennedy that the United States might do well to assassinate Fidel Castro . Or it is the testimony of Charles Francis Adams , who , in the latter half of the nineteenth century , spent twenty years in the railroad business , finding and losing fortunes . In the heyday of American capitalism he had known the great men of the period ( Gould , Morgan , Hill , and their confederates ) , and he regretted having made their acquaintance . " Not one that I have ever known , " he said , " would I care to meet again , whether in this world or the next ; nor is one associated in my mind with humor , thought , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of goods , but the vacuity remains . The dehumanizing effects of capitalism become more vicious as they become separated from the exuberance of the dreaming mind . The builders of the American railroads presumably had a vision of a continent drawn together by lines more palpable than those found on any of the known maps . The contemporary evidence suggests that their descendants no longer have the energy to conceive of anything but their own safety . Their crimes have a sallow and diminished aspect , as if it was all they could do to steal a few thousand dollars from the corners of a bureaucracy . Like the ministers of the Ford Foundation , they seem to dwindle into the personae of courtiers or shuffling clerks , doing whatever anyone asks them to do in exchange for the prerogatives of office . What impressed me about the Watergate scandal was the pettiness of it . In decorous conference rooms of the so-called Establishment these days , whether in the universities , the banks , or the departments of government , I have the uneasy feeling that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the people who use and own the money . @# THROUGH THE LONG CHAINS of political and economic causation , whether it is a matter of kings levying taxes for their murdering crusades or Senators Hubert Humphrey and Howard Baker timidly T accepting gratuities from the Gulf Oil Corporation , the strand of the profit motive weaves itself into the thread of human destiny as inextricably as molecules of DNA . If it is possible for Harold Geneen to earn $750,000 a year as president of ITT , or for the New York Times to pay $500,000 for the syndication rights to Richard Nixon 's memoirs , and then resell those rights for a reported $1.25 million , then it must be required of somebody else to eat dog food in a Brooklyn slum . We are all of us caught up in the same net of circumstances from which only the more inventive impulse of the capitalist genius can rescue us . This is an unfortunate and no doubt primitive state of affairs , and I wish that it were not so , but I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press who mumble about the quasireligious foundations of a free society remind me of the spokesmen for the business interests who believe that their products appear in the retail stores as if by virgin birth . They forget that if people take seriously the guarantee of their inalienable rights they have no choice but to fight for the truths they hold to be self-evident . Like the totalitarian or religious systems of thought , they would have me believe that the slaughter does n't exist , that people somehow conduct themselves according to the movements of stars or political abstraction . Their hypocrisy obscures the dynamic as well as the tragedy of the capitalist paradox . The best that can be done is to ameliorate the slaughter , but this is difficult to do if the scribes and the pharisees insist that capitalism brings nothing but gladness to the hearts of the people obliged to obey its rules . Over a long enough period of time , possibly through the slow evolution of the next eight or nine generations , people might think of a way to relieve themselves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property as lightly as they exchange remarks about the nuclear holocaust , and their inherent worth might come to be traded in . a market of good intentions . But for the time being I do n't see how the paradox can be resolved . The attempts to break it by force or subversion , either because it has become embarrassing to the fastidious ministers of the state or because it does not lend itself easily to the language of ideological doctrine , seem to me comparable to the building of guillotines . The failure to maintain even an imperfect balance between the rich and the poor allows for only two possibilities . Given the institutional bias of American society , I expect that the weight would fall on the side of sanctimonious tyranny rather than toward a renewal of the revolution of 1776. @# HARPER 'S MARCH 1977 37
