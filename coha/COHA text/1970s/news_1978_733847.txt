txt Until a few months ago , Larry Berner was considered an excellent teacher at the Fitch Mountain Elementary School in Healdsburg , Calif . Praised by parents , students and colleagues , the 38-year-old former Air Force lieutenant planned a long career " doing what I 'm best at  --  working with children . " Last spring , however , Mr. Berner put his job on the line : He voiced his opposition to a California ballot proposal that would permit local school boards to fire homosexual teachers , and he publicly acknowledged his own homosexuality . " I was just exercising my constitutional right to free speech , " Mr. Berner says . Now , as the Nov. 7 vote nears , Mr. Berner finds himself caught in a storm of controversy over whether homosexuals should be permitted to teach in public schools . Sentiment in Healdsburg , a small town in the Sonoma Valley wine country , is split ; some parents back Mr. Berner , and others demand his dismissal . " Larry Berner is out bragging he 's a homosexual , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is leading the campaign against homosexual teachers . " We 're going to get him , " the senator adds . First Statewide Test Sen. Briggs ' initiative , known as Proposition 6 , has emerged as perhaps the most controversial measure in this fall 's California campaign . The initiative is signficant because it is the first statewide test of the " gay rights " movement , which already has suffered setbacks in local elections in Dade County , Fla ; Wichita , Kans. ; St. Paul , Minn. , and Eugene , Ore . Although the measure is opposed by a broad range of public figures ? including such unlikely allies as Gov . Jerry Brown and his predecessor , Ronald Reagan ? polls indicate that the proposal has an even chance of passing , and thus dealing another setback to homosexual rights . The initiative specifically provides for dismissal of teachers who engage in " homosexual conduct , " which is defined as " advocating , soliciting , imposing , encouraging or promoting of public or private homosexual activity . " Bion Gregory , California 's chief legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprecisely worded " that it " could be read to subject a teacher to dismissal , whether homosexual or not , simply for campaigning against the initiative . " Proposition 6 is different from the Dade County  --  and other " gay rights " referendums , in which ' voters repealed statutes guaranteeing homosexuals equal rights in employment , housing and other areas . Proposition 6 deals exclusively with teachers , and thus it cuts to the heart of the emotional homosexual-rights issue . - Mixed Feelings In a recent nationwide Harris poll , 54% of those surveyed said they favored legislation barring job discrimination against homosexuals . But when asked about specific professions , 55% said homosexuals should n't be allowed to teach . , " Despite public feelin that discrimination against homosexuals is n't justified , most Americans are opposed to hiring them for jobs that might bring them into contact with the young , " Louis Harris , the pollster , concludes . To counter that opposition , homosexUals and their supporters are seeking to convince voters that Proposition 6 would unnecessarily increase government power and invade citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books to protect the youngsters , " . WllsOn Riles , state superintendent of schools , says . Proposition 6. adds Don . Bradley , a professional campaign manager who is heading the opposition to the initiative , " would legalize discrimination and lead to witch hunts . " Not so , says Sen. Briggs , who notes that under the initiative teachers could be fired only after two hearings and that all dismissals would " be subject to judicial ? review . " This is a question of Parents ' rights , not gay rights , " he declares . " Parents have the right to prevent the homosexuals from gaining access to their children . " The Briggs campaign material plays to parents ' fears about child molestation . One widely distributed pamphlet includes a montage of lurid headlines chronicling such assaults . " Are all homosexuals ' nice ' ? " the caption reads . " Judge for yourself . " The senator also contends that homosexual teachers can ? intentionally or unintentionally ? " recruit " students into homosexuality by serving as " favorable role models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every major study has concluded that 90% to 95% of child-molestation cases are heterosexual in nature . On the " role-model " issue , they cite such experts as Alan P. Bell , a researcher at the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research , who contends , " A person 's basic sexual orientation is crystallized at relatively early ages , and what happens to them later has little if any effect . " Mr. Bell calls the role-model argument " patently absurd . " The strongest backing for Proposition 6 has come from a statewide network of 300 fundamentalist churches that was put together by a right-wing preacher named Ray Batema . " Homosexuals are influenced by Satan , " Rev. Batema thunders from his pulpit in Pomona 's Central Baptist Church . To a chorus of " amens " from his Southern California congregation , he blames " permissiveness " and " long hair on men " for the increased acceptance of " this wicked sin . " Proposition 6 opponents have marshaled their own religious forces , including the United Church of Christ of Southern California , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Episcopal Church . " One can not forget that in our own generation the Hitler program of human extermination began with homosexuals , " says the Rt . Rev. C. Kilmer Myers , Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese of California . The barrage of charges and countercharges may be confusing many California voters . Typical is Mary Wilson , a Los Angeles housewife , who says , " I do n't want my kids to grow up to be homosexuals , but I 'm also opposed to any type of discrimination . " Unless she makes up her mind by Election Day , Mrs. Wilson says she wo n't vote on the measure at all . Many Minds Made Up Other parents have already made up their minds . " Proposition 6 shows a tremendous lack of humanity , " Bernice B. Deutscher , a Walnut Creek housewife , says . " Our son once had a gay teacher , and he was one of the best teachers around , " she adds . But a strong supporter of the initiative , John Pickrell , a Concord construction engineer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . " Then Mr. Pickrell adds , " I do n't want my kids looking up to a homosexual . " A common view is expressed by Robert Hammond , a structural mechanic from Ontario , who also favors the initiative . " I do n't mind if homosexuals are teaching , as long as they keep it hidden , " he says . " That way , there 's no danger to the kids . " That sentiment rankles some homosexual activists , who have been urging homosexuals to " come out of the closet . " Harvey Milk , a former Wall Street securities analyst who now is an openly homosexual city supervisor in San Francisco , says , " The only way we can win our acceptance is for people to realize there are gays in every profession , at every level of society . " He adds , " We 'd win this initiative if every gay person in this state ' came out ' to parents , friends and colleagues . " Media Blitzes Planned Both sides are trying to raise at least $1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be predicted , nor can the effect of the many big-name endorsements . The most-prominent supporter of Proposition 6 is Anita Bryant , the Florida orange-juice promoter who played a big role in last year 's antihomosexual campaign in Dade County . On the other hand , many show-business personalities oppose the measure , and Howard Jarvis , who led the successful fight to pass the tax-cutting Proposition 13 , calls the Briggs initiative " discriminatory . " Another conservative , Mr. Reagan , says he believes that Proposition 6 " has the potential for infringing basic right 's of privacy and perhaps even constitutional rights . " He adds that " innocent lives could be ruined " if , for example , an overwrought youngster , disappointed by bad grades , maliciously accused a teacher of advocating homosexuality . Foes of the measure also have orchestrated an impressive list of institutional opponents ; included are the American Civil Liberties Union , the state Parents and Teachers Association and dozens of labor unions ( among them , the Teamsters ) . Sen. Briggs says he is unconcerned . " The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May The people were n't with him , however , when he ran for the Republican gubernatorial nomination earlier this year . He was so far behind in the polls that he quit the race in May , and then he used most of his campaign funds to put Proposition 6 on the ballot . Although these financial dealings were questioned by Proposition 6 opponents , Attorney General Evelle Younger cleared Sen. Briggs of any wrongdoing . The 48-year-old senator , who once called the Democratic Party " the party of grass , gays and godlessness , " enjoys what he calls " confrontation politics . " Critics charge him with using the homosexual-teachers issue to set the stage for a future statewide race , perhaps for a U.S. Senate seat in 1980 . Indeed , Mr. Briggs acknowledges , " Yes , I would like to be a U.S. Senator . " He has been traveling around the state , garnering headlines as he debates homosexuals and their backers . " Politics is show business , " he says in an interview . He then explains his lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines sends the others into fits of rage . " David Goodstein , publisher of a homosexual newspaper , the Advocate , believes that even if Sen. Briggs wins , " Gays will ultimately gain acceptance in America . " Mr. Goodstein continues , " For every gay person Briggs pushes batk into the closet , there are two people he 's pushing out , He has united the gay community as nothing else could .
