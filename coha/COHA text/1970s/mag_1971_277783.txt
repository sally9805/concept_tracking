Until lately , notable female rock groups have been about as numerous as girl goalies in the National Hockey League . <P> Which is understandable . Today 's rock climate is far removed from the sugary days of Phil Spitalny and his all-girl orchestra . There is nothing particularly feminine about strumming a deafening electric guitar , flailing with feet and hands at an electric keyboard , or stomping the stage shouting overamplified sex lyrics . The few females to succeed in rock ( Janis Joplin , Grace Slick , Genya Ravan ) have usually been singers in all-male bands . <P> Now , partly as a result of the Wornen 's Lib movement , female rock groups are breaking out around the country . Most are notable mainly for their forensic rather than their musical line : <P> &gt; Pride of Women , a Detroit group , consists of four leggy but irate girls who lay down a rough , reeling beat as raw as anything done by the early Rolling Stones . Trouble is , the girls ' sexual solidarity is too ferociously antimale to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( " Get your gun , honey . Do n't be afraid to kill the soldiers when they come . " ) Pride of Women , in fact , so enraged the clientele at a Louisville bar that the manager sprayed Mace at the group , which fled outside , only to find that an off-duty policeman had riddled their truck 's fenders with bullets . <P> &gt; Goldflower is a new New York rock trio that offers a quiet , countrified sound with occasional Women 's Lib lyrics ( " I 'm a gettin ' - on woman-gettin ' on by myself-sometimes I take it out and shake it-most times I leave it on the shelf " ) . Composed of two college dropouts and a graduate of the University of Wisconsin , Goldflower works the Eastern college circuit and so far has no interest in a recording contract . " We 're not trying to make money , " says Singer Lorraine Shapiro . " We 're trying to get women to organize and fight repression . " <P> &gt; Los Angeles ' newest girl group somewhat coyly calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an album , just released by Reprise Records . The sound is not impressive . But the sight of four young girls making rock-'n ' - roll music is still a novelty , and the girls have been able to start a tour . <P> The one outfit so far that can compete with top-level male band quality is Joy of Cooking , and it is only partly female . The group is owned and led by two 32-year-old women . Terry Garthwaite , a tough rock singer , plays electric guitar and sings with a scratchy authority that can suggest Janis Joplin . Her partner , Toni Brown , a pretty Bennington graduate , sings , stomps around the stage , plays electric piano and organ , and writes songs about what it is like to be a woman ( " Time goes , and the baby keeps growin ' , and I ca n't help knowin ' , baby I love you " ) . The girls - backed by three males , Fritz Kasten , 27 , drums , Ron Wilson , 37 , congas , and Jeff Neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wailing gospel and riffs of pure country , folk and hard rock , all curiously overlaid with Latin conga rhythms . <P> Joy of Cooking does best on Only Time Will Tell Me , a gospel song written by Toni and sung by Terry , and Castles , which ends with the two girls twining their voices in a long , wild scramble of Afro scat singing .
