Perhaps too much TV , certainly too little hard work in school <P> Fourteen years ago , scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests , those college entrance exams taken with dread each year by a million high school students , began to drift downward-after holding steady for decades . The mean score for verbal ability , measured on the SAT 'S 200 to 800 scale , dropped gradually from 478 in the 1962-63 academic year into the 430s . The median mathematics score slipped from 502 into the 470s . In 1975 , when the combined score plunged eleven points in just one year , alarmed parents and educators demanded to know why . The widespread concern prompted the College Entrance Examination Board and the Educational Testing Service , which sponsor and develop the exam , to commission an independent panel to study the decline . <P> Two years , $600,000 and an 8-in.thick volume of data later , the 21-member advisory panel on the SAT score decline delivered its findings last week . As Chairman Willard Wirtz , former Secretary of Labor , brusquely summed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years . " Although the 75-page final report is fraught with qualifiers in the traditional academic manner , the panel came to some firm conclusions about the nature of American schools-and society - that in the experts ' own phrase warrant " careful attention by everybody interested in education . " <P> The panel found that the score decline was initially caused by a more socially varied group taking the SATs . In the 1960s there were " significant increases " in the number of women ( who score lower in math ) , students from low-income families , and minority groups who began to take the tests . By the end of the decade of educational expansion , almost half of all students-compared with a third in 1964-were going on to college . Suddenly the SATs , traditionally taken by an elite college-bound group , broadened to include students entering community colleges and in general those with lower grades . Thus the drop , concluded the panel , was in some degree natural . The " contributing cause , " they noted , was not the new group 's lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> After 1970 another factor entered in , this time affecting the elite group : the number of top achievers-those scoring over 600-and middle scorers started to fall alarmingly . The panel traced the subsequent across-the-boards decline to other causes summed up as a general " lowering of educational standards . " Among the specific and damning failings cited : <P> &gt; The high rates of absenteeism now condoned in schools . <P> &gt; Grade inflation , coupled with grade-to-grade promotion that is viewed as " an entitlement rather than something to be earned . " <P> &gt; " Juvenile writing delinquency , " brought on by lack of proper training in reading and writing . Although the group noted that elective subjects had often displaced fundamental English courses , they recommended not a return to the basics but in general " more thoughtful writing , above the present level of gibberish and graffiti . " <P> &gt; Half the homework of former days , and less demanding textbooks with more pictures and wider margins . The panel found that eleventh-grade textbooks are now at a ninth-to tenth-grade level .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
