WOMEN IN A ROMAN COW-YARD i again ? " KATHERINE SAID . " Thieves gin:2 , " Ladri ! Si , ladri ! " Lucia cried , brandishing her string shopping bag . Every day Lucia was robbed by thieves . The accusation never varied , and was actually a summons . Every day Katherine Cardew obeyed it and ran downstairs , hoping for a letter and a check , but prepared to listen to Lucia 's ceremonial choler . Lucia was their landlady and therefore powerful . If not properly attended she might lock the hot water faucet or remove a fuse and plunge the house in darkness , or fill the refrigerator with fish . Today 's diatribe had to do with the cost of American instant puddings , on which the landlady 's old mother depended for her life . Katherine appreciated the high cost of living in Rome , and she naturally sided with the helpless , but today she was more anxious for herself . Two weeks , and no word from Daniel . She knew that the postman came at about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she noticed the pocket to Lucia 's dress . It contained two letters . " Niente lettere ? " she asked , hinting . Lucia continued her harangue . Katherine struggled to understand the connection between Lucia 's mother 's stomach and the post office strike , which had just begun or just ended . She waited in some suspense . Daniel had been gone for two whole weeks . They had quarreled before , but always made up . Now she felt a vague panic that maybe he 'd gone forever , leaving her to manage two small children , one persecuted landlady and her dying mother , and the annihilating heat of a Roman summer . She pointed to Lucia 's pocket . " Niente lettere ? " she repeated . " From the Signor Cardew ? " " No . Non c'e niente ! " Lucia clutched the letters to her bosom . Oh . the sinful films being made in Rome ! Si ! The work of the American studenti and illicit relations in sleeping bags beneath the very portals of the Vatican ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eloquence . She gave up trying to translate , and hoarded her strength in an effort at patience . She thought she glimpsed Daniel 's handwriting , but the ink was an unfamiliar brown . Lucia continued . Oh , but the polluted Tiber ! Katherine nodded . " Si , Signora . . . " The Signora Lucia Felici wore a gold wedding ring embedded in a fleshy finger , but there was no mention of the Signor Felici , and Katherine guessed he 'd run off years ago . Sometimes she doubted his existence altogether . Who would marry such a woman ? Her eyes were small and black ; her chin jutted out and its brown mole sprouted long hairs . Anger carved her features , and perhaps her hair . Lucia cut this black mop at whim , with a knife and without a mirror . She was huge , as though with child . Yet despite this maternal hulk she had a curiously virginal quality . She wore floral-patterned wraparound dresses , her heavy legs sheathed in mauve stockings . She could be thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with sudden malice . " No letter ! " Lucia despised Daniel , possibly all men . But why was she so mysteriously persecuted ? And why , in this country of long siestas , was she always rushing ? She thundered up and down the stairs , carrying puddings , a bedpan , soiled linen . She rushed to the factory where she worked by the hour , making artificial flowers . She rushed to and from the market , carrying her string hag of bargains . Now she used the letters as a fan and denounced the summer sun . Katherine 's patience vanished . It was no wonder Lucia lived alone and had no visitors . She was a spinster by choice , angry at the whole universe . " Niente , niente lettere ! " Lucia fanned herself vigorously . Katherine felt humiliated , watching . Lucia had the letters and the largess , Lucia could grant privileges or refuse them ; her home was not a pensione . Tucked away from the main thoroughfare , it squatted sideways in a cul-de-sac at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rooms on the second floor , and have the use of the new bathroom with the pink bidet that the children considered their own private fountain . Lucia pocketed the letters . Katherine 's humiliation changed to mutiny . She felt a crazy urge to snatch the letters and make off with them . She could certainly outrun Lucia , but where would she run ? Upstairs to her rooms where the children were playing ? ( Were they all right ? ) Up another flight to the attic where Lucia 's old mother lay ingesting American puddings ? ( Was she really dying ? ) Or into the empty parlor on the ground floor , daily vacuumed but never used ? ( Why the disconnected telephone on the rickety table ? ) Or into the room occupied by Lucia 's other boarder , a musician who slept during the day and played the clarinet at night ? ( Where , in what sinful spot ? ) Lucia 's closet-sized bedroom was near the stairs that led to the spacious kitchen with its two stoves , two huge sinks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Katherine shouted suddenly . " Sitenzio ! " Katherine obeyed . But why this order ? What emergency ? The children ? Or Lucia 's mother ? Suddenly the silence was broken . The musician was practicing his clarinet . A scale ran up and down two octaves , softly , like a lullaby . It sang to her intimately . Then she heard an earsplitting blast : his warning to both women to stop shouting and let him sleep . " What 's his name ? " Katherine whispered . " We 've never met . " Lucia spoke in a hissing whisper , her eyes narrowed . The Signor Cardew was away ; in his absence it was sinful for the Signora Car-dew to wish introduction to another man ; she , Lucia , would not sanction it in her home . Abruptly she thrust two peaches at Katherine . Mutely , with Irish caution , Katherine accepted them , certain in her soul that Lucia had Daniel 's letter in her pocket . " Grazie , Signora , " she whispered . Ts on , kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate and hung there like monkeys in blue sunsuits , white hats . Katherine followed , grateful to be out of the house , grateful for her daughters : Carol at six with some newly discovered solemnity and Roo at three , already a rebel . At the end of the alley the tarred highway , blistering and smelling in the noonday sun , boomed with traffic . Here they turned left up the narrow incline that led to the seminary and a small public garden . Turning left again they climbed a steep hill until they reached the cobblestoned market where Lucia shopped and was robbed by thieves . The heat was intense and redolent . Fish stank freshly of the sea ; meat hung from hooks , dripping blood , gorged upon by flies ; potatoes , heaped high upon pushcarts , smelled of earthy fields ; and purple onions hung in ropes . Here , stepping over cobbles that glistenedwith fish scales , small puddles of blood , shallow pans of entrails , Katherine spoke her limited Italian . Here , too , she was admired and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob her by hidden and practiced methods , and mock her afterward . But they were also Italians with a famous tradition , ready to pay homage to her foreign beauty , her long blond hair , her pretty children . Today she bought salad greens that Lucia might share with them . They were both women without men . Should n't they be friends , enjoy a certain tranquility together ? " Look at the pregnant lady ! " Carol cried , pointing . " Roo ! Where 's Roo ? " They found Roo behind a wooden bucket of flowers . Giddy with relief , Katherine bought a huge bouquet . She felt morally slack , extravagant . Was it the heat ? Her long hair clung to her neck ; her lips tasted of sweat . " Does the baby have toys ? " Carol asked . " In the lady 's tummy . " " No , love . The baby sleeps . All curled up . " " But could n't the pregnant lady swallow something ? " " Swallow what ? " " One tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HID the heat in darkness . Katherine sat by the window , gazing at the moon-tinted path and the iron gate , which looked like a spider . Why had n't Daniel written ? Was he still angry at her ? They 'd argued violently about where to go now that he 'd finished his dissertation . No more ancient Roman law ! Now what ? Stay in Italy , borrowing more money from his family ? Or return to America , expatriates in need of a job , a small apartment ? The wrangling had left Daniel without a plan but cheerful . He 'd take a trip ! What about Circe 's mountain ? Katherine had surrendered , exhausted . She had become listless and strangely chaste , haunted by the suspicion that her mother had been right , the marriage all wrong . Well , she 'd agreed to Circe 's mountain . And the week 's separation . She 'd stubbed her cigarette out , and vowed to stop smoking . So off he 'd gone to Sabaudia , a Mussolini town of no interest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village garrisoned against civilization and the angry sea . Daniel 's adventure ! Leaning on the windowsill , Katherine imagined the sea curling and crashing against the mountain 's tumbled rocks , eroding ancient caves with a sucking sound . She felt a twinge of wistful. 70 ness , maybe self-pity . She imagined herself there . Oh , to leap upon a rock , stretch her body taut , and dive into the white water ! How gloriously cold ! But tonight 's heat returned her to reason , and she relinquished the caves of Monte Circeo for more personal adventures : Carol and Roo , Lucia , and this foreign heat that drained her of ordinary common sense . Why would Lucia hide a letter from Daniel ? She heard the front door open and close , and watched the musician , carrying his clarinet case , walk down the path . At the gate he stopped , as if sensing her presence , then vanished down the alley . on e'i niente per lee ! " Lucia said . " Niente letterer " " The post office strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Italy was full of strikes . Yes , even the cows were on strike . Yet now Lucia 's eloquence concerned a much graver governmental failure : the closing of Italy 's brothels . Yes , that had been a day of national mourning ! Black crepe hung from balconies . For it was common knowledge that now no marriage was secure from adultery , no husband free from some scheming trollop who worked in an office , no wife safe from scandal . Men accosted virgins and became diseased overnight . Katherine did not know whether this last tidbit concerning Rome 's downfall was the result of Lucia 's inflamed imagination or her own faulty translation in their polyglot language . Lucia stopped for breath . " So the Signor Cardew does not write ! " she said spitefully . " Like the Signor Felici ! " Katherine said . And she walked upstairs , leaving Lucia to yell at her old mother or tell the young musician about the closing of brothels and the marriage of priests and other horrors . She felt tall and slim and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly she regretted her remark about the Signor Felici . At best it was tactless ; at worst , wounding . And who was there to forgive her ? She felt a punishing headache , and a strange desire to believe , to go to confession as Lucia did every Sunday and have some mysterious male voice forgive her her sins .... ATHERINE PLANNED the next day out of Lucia 's domain . She treated the children to break-fast at the trattoria on the rumbling highway , and took them to the Borghese Gar-dens . The trip involved three bus rides , but the gardens blazed with color , and the children played hide-and-seek in the museum . Again Roo disappeared . Finally Katherine found her curled up at the base of an equestrian statue , asleep on the cool marble . After lunch they rested in the seminary garden . Few people came to this small patch of baked earth , oddly lacking in sundial , fountain , or statue . But there were some flower beds , and a stone bench canopied by a huge gnarled tree . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its exposed roots tilted the bench and spread out in lumps and loops beyond its shade , strangling all other vegetation . The children took off to watch an old gardener dig up one of the flower beds . Katherine rested against a root , but she felt nagged by suspicions : that Lucia was hiding Daniel 's letter , that Lucia was a little paranoid , crazy , and that 's why her rooms were cheap . Yet who had picked these cheap rooms with the rowdy , persecuted Lucia ? Mrs , Cardew , speaking her fractured Italian . Katherine blinked against the sun , and told herself to take one day at a time . Tomorrow was Sunday . Lucia would go to Mass . Katherine looked forward to a day of peace . Every Sunday a young priest in a black soutane entered Lucia 's home and climbed the stairs to the attic to hear the old lady 's confession and give her absolution . Katherine closed her eyes . What could an old woman have to confess ? Perhaps she wished for death . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lucia 's death . Was it possible , at her advanced age , that certain memories stirred her to covet the body of a man ? Katherine felt the heat pull her consciousness into some fine haze that hung above her body and had to do with God . An unbeliever , she looked upon religion as a mystery that worked in odd ways . Certainly it had inspired St. Peter 's dome , the Sistine Chapel ceiling , Bernini 's sculpture , art all over Rome . And it inspired banality , too , dreadful trinkets and medals sold everywhere . Arbitrarily , it humbled the proud , took money from the poor , made laws and political alliances , and kept the old gardener turning the brown earth for no apparent reason , sustained by the faith that this was God 's will . Perhaps it was . Religion did a lot of odd jobs . It built guilt , made sex a sin , dealt with hysteria in the confessional The whole concept was terrifying . And she thought of the young men preparing for the priesthood. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young seminarians , walking about with their books , looked a lot healthier than Daniel 's friends at the Academy , whose sexual exploits left them haunted and listless . A bell tolled five o'clock . As the last chime fell , a tall brown-clad figure strode toward the tree , his heavy soutane girdled by a tasseled cord , a blue notebook under his arm . At the edge of the shade he stopped and smiled at her as if she were too lovely for words , a painting of this perfect afternoon . She smiled back , returning the compliment . Together they prolonged the moment , held it high above the depths of sex until it reached a silent Amen . Then he strode down the hill . Katherine started breathing again , unaware that she had stopped . And now she felt a peculiar sensation , a cramp that was the sudden pull of the forbidden healthy young man hidden in yards of brown cloth . Why should n't priests marry ? " Mummy , why does Daniel have a holiday ? And we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome . " " I 'm hot , " Roo whined . HE CHILDREN SLIElePrT haos ltihdoauygh d f ommge Dan-d. iel and marriage . Something of a blessing . But had he abandoned them forever ? Had something happened to Daniel ? Had he taken that high dive from Circe 's mountain and crashed on the rocks below ? She saw his naked mutilated body being sucked in and out of the caves at each tide ... my God ! What was happening to her ? And she wondered whether it was possible to remain sane in this climate that dazed the senses and alerted them without warning , so that she squandered money on flowers and flirted with vendors and smiled wantonly at young priests . Below her , tones from the clarinet trilled softly like birds strangely awake in the hot night . C razie , Signora ! " " Prego .. .. " r Their Sabbath decorum was God 's job done well . All was forgiven . Huge ripe peaches for the Cardews ! Katherine 's bouquet of flowers for the Signora Felici 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass . Katherine felt a moment 's grace , and then envy . Why could n't she sail off to Mass ? And she thought of the Chapel of Saint Bartholomew just beyond the seminary . Why not go there today ? She would never be able to enter the Kingdom of Heaven , nor receive amnesty for her many sins ( sins of thought mostly ) , but later today she and the children would enter one of God 's houses ... s HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS to the attic , carrying her bouquet . " Signora ? " she called softly . , The old lady 's room was an oven . Drawn shutters filtered the sun 's spectrum to a yellowish light in which Katherine saw a heap of quilts , a wizened brown face , two tiny alert eyes . Shc put the flowers on a table next to a porcelain bowl and pitcher centered on a crocheted doily . A bedpan stood beneath the table , not yet emptied . Katherine , forever deprived of absolution , felt she should empty it . Reason intervened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paying guest , not her servant . She glanced at the mound of quilts.Lucia 's mother now seemed asleep behind paper-thin eyelids . She suddenly looked dead . Was she dead ? And was this asphyxiating heat the climate of old age or a daughter 's tyranny ? Katherine felt a tomb would be cooler , 72 more comfortable . The eyelids flickered briefly , showing a gleam of senile mischief . Oh , a tomb would be cooler ! HEY ENTERED THE CHAPEL , the children subdued . A small table supported a rack of candles . Katherine knelt , but no prayer came . She selected a burning taper , and feeling a humble fervor , lit one candle after another until they were all burning . " Oh God , where 's Roo ? " " I 'm cold , " Roo said , hopping . " And I want to ... " " Shhhhhhh ! " They sat down on a pew . Katherine shivered , feeling the stone floor through her sandals , and looked about her . A lectern support . ed an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statuettes , cloth emblems richly embroidered . High above a flickering oil lamp Christ writhed , glistening with agony on a wooden Cross . Blood dripped in red globules ; the beard shone as though drenched with sweat ; gold bolts of lightning shot toward the gold frame like fireworks for the glory of raw martyrdom . She heard the chanting from Saint Bartholomew 's Church : the priest 's incantation , the penitents ' answering chorus , and finally the fine thin line of beauty from the boys ' choir . She hugged Roo , who was as warm as the outdoors , and glanced down at Carol . She was staring at the Crucifixion , her small face pinched with fear . " It 's only a picture , " Katherine whispered . " It is n't real . " " I want to whisper you something , " Carol whispered . " Whisper a little louder . " " Roo 's making a tinkle .... " Katherine felt her heart thump strangely , as if it were pumping red paint instead of blood . She lifted Roo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent further desecration of Saint Bartholomew , Jesus , all of Italy , God . She put Roo down on the stone-flagged corridor outside , but Roo had finished . " Padre ! " Young , striding along in his black soutane , the padre turned a ruddy face to her . She grabbed his clothing , a fistful of black serge behind which was the body of a young man who looked , Gesii Cristo , kind and intelligent , and understanding . She tried to find the Italian words to explain the wet pew cushion . He removed her hand gently , and answered in English . Yes , he understood . He also appreciated her attempt at worship . Thirty-two candles ! Two candles would have been quiteproper ; one , with devout prayer , would not have displeased Our Savior . He smiled at her kindly , and she felt her punishment gather . 00 HAD a temperature . At three in the morning Katherine gave her two more aspirin and crept downstairs to make her some weak , ? sweetened tea . She fumbled for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few seconds it took to reach the floor below , but she stumbled , and the light went off , and a long sorrowful moan came from somewhere . From Lucia 's mother ? From Lucia , whose torments would never end ? She felt the darkness stir as if gathering uneasy dreams into this moan of loneliness belonging to the whole house . At last Roo slept . Katherine saw the dawn spill thickly through the shutters like a white soup ... and felt a sudden piercing hunger . She crept downstairs again . Fatigued beyond the simple action of finding the light switch , she stumbled into Lucia 's kitchen and opened the refrigerator . The food looked sickening : puddings , congealed fish , spaghetti . A sound made her turn , and she saw the young musician . He stood by the stove , wearing dark trousers , a dish towel tucked into his belt as a makeshift apron , his chest naked except for a small crucifix . He smiled , showing white teeth , and gestured with a fork toward a plate of sliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Wordlessly she accepted his hospitality . She attended to the stove , the peppers , and he emptied the can of beans into the skillet , and she stirred the mixture , and he opened a bottle of wine and filled two glasses , and she set the table with plates and Lucia 's bent forks . Capable of speech , they chose silence . Silence was a treasure like love . Together , in a communion of fatigue and hunger , they possessed the smoky hour between dawn and the milky white morning . Upstairs a pipe groaned . They put the dishes away , and parted like sleepwalkers , without a word . r ? -1 HE SUN WAS a silver disc lodged sol-idly in the floating blue sky . Katherine lugged her laundry out into the court --  6- yard , a small enclosure collecting heat behind the thick walls , mottled by stones that looked like the spots of some disease . After her sleepless night she felt dreamy and over-powered , and hung the sheets up in a trance , as if her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtyard . Her 74 father had died noisily , quoting Descartes . Mom would die one day . . . and so would she . She saw herself enter this courtyard , a dead soul locked in an eternal noon , forever hanging up a wash . Upstairs the children were quarreling . " Roo did it ! " Carol shouted . " All over the bathroom ! " Lucia 's bidet was indeed a fountain , flooding its pink basin , spreading gracefully over the mosaic floor , each tile a blue and white replica of Madonna and Child . She struggled with various knobs while the tiles mocked her beneath rippling water , and then kicked savagely at a gleaming handle that looked far too modern for this old house with its nightly moans and groans . The fountain stopped . Katherine mopped up the flood , praying for Lucia 's forgiveness .... T HE CHILDREN PLAYED in the courtyard . Katherine took down her laundry , already spotted with soot , and brought it indoors . On the kitchen table was a letter addressed to her in Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The envelope had been opened with a knife , and the paper removed and refolded . Katherine scanned the large , undisciplined handwriting . Apparently the Mediterranean was blue . Monte Circeo was built entirely within the pastel-shaded walls of an ancient castle erected centuries ago to protect the mountain from invasion . They were having a great time . Last night he 'd eaten sparrows for dinner . The birds were trapped alive and cooked and served whole . The legs crunched between your teeth . This was real Italy , raw life . He 'd sent her some quaint sandals . Had they arrived ? She turned the page , hoping that the sound of her own voice would make the words real : A bunch of us have decided to do our own thing and to hell with guides ! We 've rented a boat  --  re-christened THE TIN TUB  --  and are taking off for Sicily and then who knows where ? We 'll just keep floating from port to port , sniffing new smells . This is real life , the real Mediterranean . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womb-fruits ? I love you ... She put the letter down , feeling outrage and a blurry pain , and saw the slit envelope . It was postmarked Naples , eight days ago , and the ink was brown . How dare Lucia Jan herself with Daniel 's letter and then pocket it and open it with a knife ? And how dare Daniel take off for " who knows where " and float about in something christened THE TIN TUB , " sniffing newsmells " and leave her in Rome with a mad landlady ? How dare he ask if the " quaint sandals " had arrived , and give no return address ? And what right had he to taste raw life at the expense of some little sparrows ? And the " womb-fruits " ? His questions were rhetorical , and so were hers . But she was a literal person suffering a private chaos , and she had a few answers . The quaint sandals had not arrived . And how was she managing ? This was how . Chaste and faithful she flirted with priests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children to Saint Bartholomew 's Chapel , where Carol had sat in silent terror and Roo had peed on a pew cushion , and where she , Katherine , had lit thirty-two candles when two would have been quite proper , and one , with devout prayer , would not have displeased Our Savior . She was falling in love with religion . Or maybe priests , because the young priests looked sexy , and maybe this was because their bodies were hidden and they were n't spread-eagled naked on beaches .... Oh yes , the bidet had flooded . And she was spending precious lire on flowers , candles , and the trattoria . The children were living on spaghetti and peaches , hardly the Spock diet . But no baby sparrows , either ! Raw life ? She 'd not slept for two nights , but she 'd had breakfast with a beau tiful young man . She returned to Daniel 's letter and felt a new wave of rage . So he loved her , did he ? Well , how ? In his TIN TUB ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , a quiet soul fermenting violence . How dare he eat sparrows and talk about raw life ? Oh , he loved her , yes ! But did she love him ? Suddenly she thought of the cooked sparrows , saw them on a white plate . She mourned them ; she wept for them uncontrollably . Lucia entered the kitchen , armed with a single word . " Polizia ! " " Si , si , Lucia ... " Lucia was momentarily silenced . Katherine began folding the sooty wash . Tears dribbled down her face , and she sniffed unashamedly . " Yes , call the police . The bidet overflowed and I 'm sorry . But I love my children . I love my children and I love real flowers . And tiny live sparrows . They should not be cooked . And I approve of brothels . I think they should be free . And I think priests should marry . And I admire the young musician . I love him , " she added , weeping . Lucia handed her a piece of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced . " I spit on the Signor Cardew ! " Lucia cried . " Scum Americano . " 76 ATHERINE PUT the children to bed . She promised herself a bath and twelve hours of sleep , but she found the hot water faucet locked , the house in darkness , and sleep strangely denied her . In bed her thoughts bent beneath the drudgery of worry and broke into fragments .... Yes , I approve of brothels . They free husbands from unwilling wives . They free wives . I am a trapped sparrow . I must cable Mom for money , but will she understand ? Yes , only too well ! Is Daniel safe in his TIN TUB ? And how safe are we without money ? Living with a mad landlady who has every right to deny me a bath ! What is love ? Must it be sex ? Chaste , I long to lie with a priest . But Daniel will turn up someday and expect me to obey him in bed . How can I cable Mom ? Easily ! Just run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect . This marriage is a trap . I am a trapped .... The trattoria was still open . But the telephone operators at this hour were a quixotic lot . Some appeared ignorant of the alphabet ; others sang their helpfulness in three languages , like opera stars , and then forgot her with a click . She imagined her mother 's pinched frown when she received the cable . She spent the rest of the night packing . At dawn she crept downstairs , hungry for anything edible , green noodles or overripe peaches . She heard a faint moan . Descending another flight , she heard another moan , then a whimper . At the kitchen door , her breathing quickened . She heard her own heart , her own breathing , and heavier breathing , and suddenly a strangled cry . Two bodies lay struggling on the kitchen floor . Lucia 's bulk heaved beneath a tangled robe ; her bare legs thrashed like trapped cobras . She was on top of her assailant , but with a sudden movement she lay pinned beneath the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold crucifix lay on his shoulder . Then her arms encircled his torso , and he rode her . His glistening buttocks rose like moons above the dawn 's horizon and plunged into shadow , and rose again . Katherine felt an electric current travel her body , like lightning of some voltage that does not kill but paralyzes . She stood powerless to move . Her mind stood still , insensible . Attuned to disaster , she possessed the conviction that life was catastrophic , that Lucia would be left dead or dying on the kitchen floor , that no woman was safe . She argued with her reason , and it returned . She was not watching rape . She was watching the tidal wave of an orgasm being reached by a passionate woman and her young lover . She took her shocked body upstairs . uctik ! My mama sends lire ... " " I spit on the Signor Cardew ! And on the Signor Felici ! " Lucia was the same . She showed no sign of the night 's loving no sign of respite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angry , unloved woman . Katherine marked the moment in her own life , and saw its dangers . But what dangers ? Life had all sorts of possibilities , such as this trinity of souls living sinful ecstasies and receiving weekly absolution . She felt her sanity return , and her humor . And something more a bit of wisdom that was just around the corner . " Molte grazie , " Katherine said , awed . Lucia 's farewell gift was a wicker basket lined with pink tissue paper and filled with peaches huge as grapefruit , plums , and tiny green grapes . This was not all . The fruit was garnished with artificial flowers made of mauve and yellow crepe paper . Katherine took the basket in her arms . " Grazie , grazie . " She knew that the fruit would be surrendered at Customs . But she would keep Lucia 's flowers : crepe paper taped to bits of wire in patience and fury and love . Lucia lowered her voice to a whisper . Yes , she knew about godless men who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about men like the Signor Cardew and the Signor Felici ; and she knew about women left to live with their mothers who ... si , si ! And she thrust two plums at the children and sent them outdoors to watch for the taxi . Carol and Roo hung on the gate . " Poor Lucia , " Roo said . " She shouts and shouts . " " It 's because she wants toys in her tummy . For her baby . She has that baby there and all that room for toys in her tummy . And no one understands ? ' " My Mummy understand everything ! " Roo said . The taxi arrived with a great rattle ; the luggage was piled inside . The two women embraced . Lucia yelled directions to the driver , wiping her tears with her gaudy apron . Katherine put on her dark glasses , her disguise behind which she might glimpse the last of real Italy , raw life . And hide her own tears . Yes , she would stay with her mother , but not forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get her divorce . Mom lived in Pennsylvania and was a vegetarian . She was a tiny energetic woman who worked as a lab technician , analyzing blood . " Arrivederci , Lucia ! " " Arrivederci ! " ? 78
