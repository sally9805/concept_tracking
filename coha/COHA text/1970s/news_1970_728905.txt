txt The United Automobile Workers began a strike at 12:01 A.M. today against the General Motors Corporation , the world 's largest manufacturer , after failing to reach a contract settlement . The strike affects 321,510 G.M. workers in the United States and 22,100 in Canada and will halt the weekly production of 132,000 cars and trucks , half the vehicle production in the two countries . Workers walked off their jobs in plants in 16 states when the three-year contract covering 700,000 auto workers ran out . The greatest impact will be felt in Michigan , Ohio , New York , Indiana , Missouri and California , which employ 276 , - 250 G.M. workers . Many Walk Out Early Thousands of workers walked off their jobs earlier yesterday , anticipating that there would be no settlement . Leonard Woodcock , the president of the union , came out of the negotiating session an hour before the strike deadline and said that G.M. " held out no other choice " but for the workers to go out on strike . The company blamed the union . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " less than equitable " and that the company had added many demands that would reduce some of the benefits in the present contract . He said , " The corporation launched a wholesale attack on production standards and grievance procedure provisions of the agreement . It is demanding that workers assume future hospital medical insurance cost increases , that sickness and accident insurance protection be diluted and quite a bit more . " Stresses Local Issues The company , Mr. Woodcock said , now would have to reach local settlements with most of the 157 bargaining units as well as a national agreement before the strikers would return to work . When the talks were opened on July 15 , the U.A.W. proposed to separate the local issues from the national contract talks . The position of the union could delay settlement of the strike , even if a national agreement is worked out . Earl R. Bramblett , vice president of General Motors in charge of the negotiating team , said , " We believe it is a strike against reason . We have placed on the bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the size and the scope of its benefits . " Ready to Continue ' " We stand ready to continue negotiations in the hope of an early settlement , " he said . At a news conference , Mr. Bramblett estimated that the lost wages would be $12-million a day and would go up rapidly as other employes were laid off . He added that the company expected to hold its next meeting with the union tomorrow . Some 72,000 other workers in 28 General Motors plants have been ordered to stay on their jobs by the union because the plants supply vital parts to Ford , Chrysler and American Motors . The union , which has been negotiating with all four auto makers since last July , at first picked General Motors and Chrysler as targets and finally narrowed it down to G.M. Mr. Woodcock said it had become obvious that G.M. had been dictating terms to the other companies . About 28,000 workers had walked off their jobs in five United States and three Canadian plants before the contract expired . The mood of General Motors workers ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a strike . Richard Cook , who recently returned from Vietnam , stood outside the Cadillac body plant here in a light rain and said : " We 're not asking too much from the economy . I 'll stand out here rain or snow until they give us what we 're asking . " Mr. Cook was among 600 workers who walked out of the plant at ' 10 A.M. He said an essential union demand was retirement after 30 years ' service , regardless of age , with a $500-a-month pension counting Social Security . G.M. has offered 30-year retirement at $500 a month to any worker who has reached the age of 58 . Mr. Cook , a tall , thin youth whose ski jacket was soaked by the rain , said that 58 was too old to enjoy retirement . " Let a guy out when he 's still energetic and not a wreck , " he said . Solomon Segrest , who has worked at the Cadillac assembly plant here for 13 years , stood in line with 10 other workers at Local 22 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By paying , he will become eligible for $30 to $40 a week lin strike benefits . The union has a $120-million strike fund , of Local 22 , said that many of the young workers who had never been involved in a strike were " raring to go . " " We 're getting a different breed of worker , " he said . " He 's not looking at the dollar so much . He wants more time off and hates working on a line . That 30 and out is a must to get these guys to accept a contract . " Besides retirement , two major issues separated G.M. and the union as they sought agreement on a new three-year contract . First-year pay increase : The company offers 3S cents an hour . Workers now average close to $4 , and General Motors calculates its offer as a 9.8 per cent raise . The union says 26 cents of that 38 centsnvovld be to make up for past lation . It has asked for a 61.5-cent increase which it calculates as an 8 per cent raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the costof-living clause for the next three years . G.M. wants'a 28-cent limit . In addition , the union has asked for such items as a dental care plan , and a Christmas bonus , while the company , wants to cut costs by making workers pay for future medical-insurance increases and to pay new men lower hourly rates than new men now get . Hourly labor costs at G.M. today are $5.76 an hour , the which it expects to last for six to eight weeks . G.M. workers have averaged $196.47 a week in pay during the second quarter . To Prepare for War ' Mr. Segrest said he did not look forward to a strike but added : " It seems that 's the only way we can get what we want . " He began putting away a little cash each week since last January and added that he lived by a slogan of Franklin Roosevelt , " to prepare for war in the time of peace . " " I wo n't be hurting for a while , " he added , " but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ray Hall , the plant chairman company estimates , and the total company offer of wage and fringe benefits is estimated by G.M. to be $1.30 to $1.40 an hour over three years . The company says that the union 's demands total $2.65 an hour . The union has not put a price tag on its demands . The effects of a strike will soon go beyond the auto workers . General Motors has about 379,000 of its 1970 cars and the company has built 208,000 of the 1971 cars . This is about a month-and-a-half supply and dealers will soon run out of cars . General Motors also buys materials , parts and services from more than 39,000 suppliers in the United States . Approximately 79 per cent of these have less than 100 employes . Big industries such as metals will also be hit severely . General Motors uses about 10 per cent of the nation 's steel , 5 per cent of its copper , 8 per cent of its iron and 35 per cent of its rubber .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
