A rare coalition votes no <P> Not often do Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader and the liberal lobbying group Common Cause find themselves on the same side of an issue with the major oil companies , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the leadership of the Republican Party . But last week just such a formidable , if unlikely coalition sank the Energy Transportation Security Act of 1977 , better known as the cargo preference bill . In a confused and acrimonious vote , the House of Representatives defeated the bill , 257 to 165 . In so doing , the legislators rejected both Jimmy Carter 's endorsement of the measure and a campaign by U.S. shipping companies and maritime unions to ensure its passage . <P> For the President , the defeat may have come as a relief in disguise . His economic advisers had predicted that the bill - which would require that by 1982 at least 9.5% of the nation 's imported oil be transported in U.S.-flag ships-would fuel inflation . Main reasons : since U.S. shipping lines pay higher wages and observe higher safety standards than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate . Domestic tankers now carry only 4% of U.S. oil imports . If their share of the market were increased to 9.5% , it would mean more business for the U.S. shippers and more jobs for U.S. seamen , but , economists estimate , it could cost the nation an additional $300 million for foreign oil . Because of higher transportation costs , the big petroleum companies would have to pay more for Arabian crude and charge more for gasoline at the pump . Hence the curious coalition between giants of the industry and consumer advocates in lobbying against the bill . <P> The maritime unions have traditionally been an influential lobby , disproportionately so , given their membership of only 73,000 . Over the years they have funneled millions in campaign contributions to selected politicians , mostly Democrats . In last year 's elections , maritime-related unions doled out $449,410 to 215 successful House candidates , including $16,200 to New York 's John Murphy , chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee , and $51,713 to five other prominent committee members . Jimmy Carter was another beneficiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 in his bid for the presidency . So when Murphy sponsored the cargo preference bill and Carter backed it last July , House Republican Leader John Rhodes was not totally unjustified in charging " political payoff . " <P> Last week Republican Congressman James Quillen of Tennessee picked up the partisan attack where Rhodes had left off . Said he : " The House has no business inflicting higher oil prices on the American people in order to fulfill President Carter 's campaign promises to the maritime unions . " Sponsor Murphy replied that he and his supporters were only trying to salvage the U.S. merchant fleet , which has dwindled from 5,000 to 570 ships during the past three decades .
