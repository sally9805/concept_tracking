But he fails to move the Senate or make his point <P> In Frank Capra 's classic cinemorality play , Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , an idealistic hick politician successfully filibusters the Senate into accepting his impassioned arguments . Last week another Mr. Smith - also a country boy , albeit a shrewd one from a far country - went to Washington seeking somewhat the same kind of improbable result . But to no avail . After four whirlwind days in the capital promoting his " internal settlement " approach to biracial government in Rhodesia , Prime Minister Ian Smith failed to impress even many of the 27 Senators who had invited him to Washington over State Department objection . <P> The Prime Minister was accompanied by the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole , the most eloquent of the three black leaders who sit with him on the executive council that is preparing the way for Smith 's concept of black rule in Rhodesia . The two leaders had a two-hour session with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance ; as they left the State Department surrounded by Secret Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized the meeting as a sparring session in which there was nothing more than " a repetition of old ideas . " In a pointed rebuff , Vance did not even bother to escort Smith from the State Department building as he customarily does with visiting dignitaries . <P> President Carter flatly refused to meet the Rhodesians , telling a press conference : " I do not intend to see Mr. Smith . There is no reason for me to meet with him . " Smith 's best moment , as a result , was a session with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . There he declared that all four members of the executive council are prepared to attend " with no preconditions " an all-parties conference on Rhodesia 's future , sponsored by the U.S. and Britain , and including Patriotic Front Leaders Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe . After checking out Smith 's statement with his Rhodesian advisers , State Department African experts concluded that the Prime Minister 's remarks represented " no change of policy . " <P> The Administration is convinced that Smith has long since lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in on last week 's sessions with Vance : " Smith maintains that everything is just fine , as though it could go on forever , even though his casualty rates , emigration and capital outflow are higher than ever . Our concern is that if Smith stays firm on the internal settlement , it is a recipe for disaster . " <P> To all who would hear him out , Smith patiently insisted that his internal settlement fulfills the conditions of an agreement he made with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1976 . In brief , Smith said , he agreed to majority rule for the breakaway British colony within two years ; in return , the U.S. and Britain would recognize the legitimacy of his government and end the United Nations sanctions that have plagued Rhodesia 's economy since 1966 . " Our case is watertight , " said Smith . " We can not understand what is wrong . "
