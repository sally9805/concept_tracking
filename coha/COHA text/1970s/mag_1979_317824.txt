Inside this week 's issue of TIME is an interesting document about a remarkable enterprise : the annual report of Gulf &; Western Industries , Inc . That broadly diversified corporation is celebrating its 20th anniversary and is marking the occasion in distinctive fashion . The 64-page pull-out section is the largest advertisement ever placed in any publication . Companies often seek to explain their business to the public through ads , but never before has a firm made such a comprehensive statement to so many people at one time . <P> Annual reports do not normally reach a broad public . In past years , no more than 300,000 people received the G &W; report . But the company believes that a wider audience can find the report instructive . Hence this advertisement , which will be seen by 22 million TIME readers in the U.S. and Europe . <P> Gulf &; Western issued its first annual report in 1959 , one year after changing its name from Michigan Plating &; Stamping Co . It was best known for producing rear bumpers for Studebakers . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work force of about 600 . The firm that year had a new chairman , a young Austrian immigrant named Charles G. Bluhdorn , who launched the company on an aggressive expansionist course . Today , under Bluhdorn 's direction , G &W; ranks 59th on the FORTUNE 500 list , with 1978 sales of $4.3 billion , earnings of $181 million , and more than 100,000 employees . Through its subsidiaries , the New York-based conglomerate produces movies ( Saturday Night Fever , Grease ) and TV series ( Laverne &; Shirley , Mark &; Mindy ) , publishes books ( bestsellers by Graham Greene and Irving Wallace ) , owns Madison Square Garden and several athletic teams ( including New York 's basketball Knicks and Washington , D.C. 's soccer Diplomats ) . G &W; also sells insurance , makes consumer and commercial loans , processes sugar , and manufactures clothing , electronic equipment , paper and auto parts . <P> In the turbulent annals of free enterprise , the relatively swift rise of Gulf &; Western must be regarded as a noteworthy success story , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that story with TIME 'S audience . The unusual advertising message appears in TIME alone . As G &; W Executive Vice President Martin S. Davis puts it , " We consider TIME readers very much a part of our success . " We too consider the quality of our readers , along with the thoroughness of our news coverage , to be responsible for the high reputation TIME enjoys in the advertising and financial communities .
