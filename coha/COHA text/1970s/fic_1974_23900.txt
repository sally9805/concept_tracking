A story by David Ohle CHILI HEARTS URING THE EARLY FIFTIES I was told to drive Li agent Farbo west from Chicago across the great plain . This was in January of the year , possibly ' 53 . We started the trip in an Agency vehicle , a black Ford . Two of its cylinders misfired at any speed above forty mph , and the driving was tedious and uncomfortable for both of us . Farbo slept in the back seat , waking up at intervals to swallow a white tablet or eat a rancid fig bar and sip yellow soda through a plastic straw . We drove on into Kansas , through Tonganoxie , Clinton , and Stull , and stopped for lunch west of Topeka in one of the Squat ' n ' Gobble restaurants . Farbo Ied me to a booth in the crotch of the dining room . Some of the customers apparently recognized him and stared . He pulled down the rim of his brown felt hat and ignored them , his face purpling , his teeth like rat 's teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night drive from Chicago had feathered my stomach and I was n't very hungry . Farbo studied his menu closely and ordered lamb fries . I asked her what these lamb fries were . Farbo laughed at this and said I should order some . The waitress said , " They 're the things off a sheep , " Farbo said , " the testicles . Order some . " My stomach flip-flopped and I asked for something lighter . She said , " You 'll want the special ? chili hearts . " I said , " Fine , and coffee with cream . " I took off my overcoat and draped it over the back of the booth . Farbo kept his on , and his face flushed in the dry heat of the restaurant . He asked if I had any children and I said no . Farbo 's meal was brought quickly , but the waitress said mine would take longer . I watched him passing lamb fries through cracked lips and then ordering vanilla ice cream and a lemon wedge . He squeezed lemon juice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into his mouth . My chili hearts had not come yet . I was told they were almost ready . Farbo lit an aromatic foreign cigarette , the smoke curling blue-white around his face . around his hat , into an aura surrounding his head . He said , " What are these chili hearts ? " I said I did n't know , I was n't familiar with food served on the plain . He then ordered and ate a dish of clear gela tin , sipped weak plains coffee , and chewed or hard triangles of white toast . As yet my chili hearts had not come . I callec our waitress over and asked about them again She seemed surprised that I had not gotter them , apologized , and went back to the kitcher to check , but I never saw her after that . There were mock fishnets and paper crab : decorating the paneled walls of the dining room A neon fixture directly above our heads was re flected in the tabletop and hummed annoyingly I saw the dry husk of a cricket on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past when I suppose the plain was covered witl them , and it had been neglected long enough fo a spider to glue a strand of web to its hollov head . Farbo said , " There 's no hurry . We do n't wan to be driving west and have the sunset in ou eyes , do we ? " I agreed that we did n't . I mentioned that being in the restauran made me feel uneasy . I said I could n't tell bin exactly why . It was a delicate and very subtl effect . He said , " What are you afraid of ? " Nothing in particular , I told him . The other lunch customers were rural types the men wearing denim coveralls and baseba. hats , the women in khaki slacks , all smelling a freshly turned hay . Farbo asked a waitress to make us a pot c stronger coffee , and we passed another hou drumming our fingernails on the tabletop an staring blankly over one another 's shoulders . There was a clock with a luminous face ahoy the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom of the casing . I said , " They do n't even care what time it is . " Farbo said , " This is the kind of treatment you 'll get all the way across the plain . These people do n't seem to have developed any philosophy of service , and they do n't have any taste in the mouth . They would just as soon eat a sparrow 's brain as a hazelnut . " I asked him what time it was . He looked at his watch and told me 4:15 . I said , " They 're shallow people , ignorant . " He said , " I can see that . It seems like if the shit is on special it should be ready sooner than anything else . I do n't like what 's going on here . " His eyes darted in their sockets like lizard 's eyes . I asked him what he thought the chili hearts might look like . He said he had eaten in hundreds of Squats from coast to coast , including this one many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu until today . He assumed they would be on some kind of Mexican plate , but he could n't imagine what they might look like . His coat hung open , and I saw the butt of his chromium pistol shining against its vinyl holster . He said it was getting close to five and the un would be down before long . He seemed old and foreign in the neon light , and the sacksunder his eyes were that much more pronounced , his face the color of stinkhorn . He said , " We 'll go soon . " I said , " They have n't brought my hearts yet . " He flagged a waitress . I said , " What about those chili hearts I ordered , miss ? " She said , " You mean the special ? " pronouncing the word " spatial . " I said , " Yes , the chili hearts . " She said , " We do n't serve the spatial after two . " I said , " I ordered at ten minutes to two , miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said they had already thrown out what was left and washed the pot . As she went through the kitchen door I heard the rattle of dinnerware and the sound of a basketball game on a radio . The flesh on Farbo 's neck above the tie knot and white collar seemed like chicken flesh . I said , " I do n't suppose they just dice up a few hen hearts and throw them in a brown soup , do you ? " He said he would n't be surprised . " Put on your coat , " he said . " This is the shits . Let 's get on the road . " He swallowed a white tablet with a sip of cold coffee . At the cash register the hostess stamped our Agency cards . Farbo told her we were crossing the plain tonight . She smiled and lit an American cigarette . She said , " Watch the weather . " Farbo said we would . Behind her , on the windowsill , a small radio was dialed to the same basketball game , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come to the Squat for lunch were now returning for supper . W E PULLED OUR COATS together and walked across the asphalt parking lot to the car . The wind had picked up and turned colder , and a thick snow had begun to fall . Farbo got into the back seat and said he would be going to sleep and I was to wake him in Dodge City . The engine started only after several tries , the battery weakening on each one . I told Farbo it might not be a good idea to make the drive in the snow . He said , " Stop worrying me . Flip on the heater and let 's go . " He pulled his coat up over his face and turned over . I said , " I guess they would 've been too hot and peppery anyway . " He said , " Yeah , you should 've ordered the lamb fries . " I milked the sputtering Ford along the narrow highway at thirty mph , Farbo sleeping fitfully in the back and complaining of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but lukewarm air came out of the vents . He said it was typical of the Agency to send him out on a delicate run like this and issue him a junker vehicle . Wet snow stuck to the windshield and froze , and the wipers raked over the ice until the rubber blades hung down shredded and the metal arms swished back and forth uselessly . I suggested we go back to the Squat ' n ' Gobble , but Farbo said they were closed . He sat up and looked around . The blacktop gradually became blanketed over with snow and disappeared . I could have easily driven off the road onto the hard mud of the plain and not known the difference and ended up in the middle of nowhere . Farbo climbed into the front seat , swallowed another tablet , ate another fig bar . He said , " It 's colder than I thought it was . " I said , " At one point she came walking toward me with a tray .. I saw a porcelain bowl with steam rising from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she went on to another booth . It was another teaser . " Farbo said , " I know . It 's really the shits . " I said , " And then that second waitress came over and claimed the first one had gone off shift and asked if there was anything we needed . So I reminded her of the chili hearts and she said she would get them right away . You remember that , Farbo ? " Farbo said , " Yeah , I remember that . " I said , " I was getting hungrier . It was making me nervous , and then she tells me they 've thrown it out . " Farbo said , " It stinks . " He offered me a fig bar . 1 said no , I did n't like the sour taste and the gritty seeds . I said , " And every time the kitchen door would open I 'd look in there to see if I could see them boiling on the stove . " I turned on the radio and found a basketball game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the temperature was ten degrees . Farbo said , " It feels like zero here . My feet are cold . " He wore lace-up black shoes and black nylon socks . I told him the tires were losing traction and we might have to stop . He said we would go until the car Would n't go any further . He told me to keep the same distance from the tele. phone poles passing by and we 'd be all right but I could only barely see the poles . I said , " We 're the only people out here . 1 have n't seen another vehicle in 200 miles , nol since we left the Squat . " He lit another foreign cigarette and said " Let 's talk about something else . tell yot about my last assignment while you drive . The ) had me running an Agency front in El Paso. 1 sold things like painted turtles , flags , cigarettes I was way off on a side street somewhere . N4 customers ever came to buy anything . A fey looked in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turtles in the windov sunning themselves . I had myself a room on tin edge of the city where I read magazines am waited two years for the next job . This is no the life for a man with a family . " I said , " The Agency told me you were aloe . in the world . " He said he was , that he was just imaginin what a man with a wife and children would suffer in this work . 1 He asked me what I had done for the Agency I told him I had driven ranking Agents fror place to place , and nothing much else . I tol him I was expecting to go on to something be ter in the spring . He said he would help me i he could . He said I was a fine driver . He aske me if I was wearing my pistol and I told him was in the trunk , although I had it in my COE pocket at the time . I reminded him that the snow was thickenin an the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be chatting about the past an avoiding the situation at hand . He said , " They 'll say something about tl weather on the radio . " I said , " You 're missing the point , Farb . They 're playing basketball . They do n't car They do n't even know we 're out here . " He told me there was n't much around build a fire with if we stopped . He said v could burn the straw in the car seats if we In to , or the clothes in our suitcases . I said we choke to death on the smoke , and it wouldr 66 a MI ! last long enough to keep our toes from freezing . He said , " I have appointments in Dodge in the morning . " I eased back on the accelerator and let the car come to a stop . Farbo said , " Do n't stop . We 'll never get going again . " I turned the motor off . Be said , " Is n't this the chits . Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better off waiting in car until the snow let up . tiff said , " Listen to me . Crank the motor and ' rive me to Dodge . " I humped the starter button . The battery turned the engine over weakly . Farbo said , " We 're dead now . " I said , " We can listen to the radio for a while . There 's enough juice left for that . " He said , " I do n't even know who 's playing . " I said , " I 'll turn it on anyway . It does n't matter . " I wondered how he had failed to notice the gun in my pocket while the coat was hanging over the booth at the restaurant . It was close enough for him to smell gun oil . We listened to the basketball game , the orange dot of Farbo 's cigarette standing quietly close to his lip . I said , " Maybe there 's a farmhouse . " He said , " Ah , shit . The lamb fries are burning my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few chili hearts burning in mine . Again he offered a fig bar and refused . He said , " I told you you should 've ordered the fries . " I said , " I know that . " He said , " My feet are numb . I ca n't feel them . " I said , " I know that . So are mine . " He said , " The world is crowding with assholes . I can see people all over the globe waiting impatiently in Agency restaurants for an order of nice hot chili hearts , or cold sheep 's things . " He laughed mechanically , his mouth like a pupoet 's mouth . He said , " It 's a big laugh . " I took the gun from my pocket and set it in : he lap of my coat . He said , " These lamb fries are about to blow ny belly open . " He settled back and closed his ayes . He said , " I used to sit in the back of that ; bop under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front window , burning ny lungs with American cigarettes . I find these Curkish cigarettes milder . " I said , " If we can wait till the snow stops and he sun comes up , a vehicle may come along on he way to the city . " He said , " They do n't farm this land anymore . iohody lives out here anymore . I 've crossed in he daylight before . There 's nothing out there ut dead grass and occasional oak stumps . sometimes you 'll see the remains of something , a brick chimney crumbling , or a rusty propane tank . The fact is , it could be quite a while before somebody decides to go to Dodge . We should n't count on that . " The basketball game ended in a bath of cello music and a prayer , and the station signed off . Farbo said , " I guess this is it . I was hoping to have breakfast in Dodge City . " He told me to turn on the light . I pulled the knob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birdlike eyes and aiming his pistol at my face . He rested the barrel over his wrist , as though he were sighting in an animal at a great distance , the smoke of his cigarette watering his eyes . He said , " I 'll do it right , do n't worry . " I smiled and started to say something to distract him . He closed one eye and said , " You have my word . You wo n't feel it . I 'm sorry . A job is a job . " I said , " Wait a minute , Farbo . This is n't right . " He let his aim slacken a moment to say something . I pushed the light knob in with my knee and fired twice at him in the dark . His pistol dropped to the seat between us . He said , " Turn on the light . You did n't do it right . It burns . " In the dim light he leaned over and folded his arms across his abdomen . He said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put his gun in my coat , opened the door , and got out . I walked away from the car fifteen yards or so to urinate . Farbo opened his window a crack and said , " I never had a single customer . Finally I had to hire a colored boy to watch the place on Saturdays so I could get away for a while . I had to pay him out of my own salary . The Agency would n't cover it . " The snow had become a flutter of dry flakes , and the sky had cleared considerably . The moon on the snow gave the air a greenish color and the lights of Dodge City were visible on the horizon . It was not as cold as I had imagined it to be . Farbo opened his door , walked a few steps toward me , and then sat down in the snow . He said , " It does n't hurt as much now . I thought it would be different . I 'm surprised . It 's not bad at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I unlaced his shoes , took his socks off and put them on my own feet , and with his help got the coat off and put that on over my own . He said it was all right now , the cigarette still burning between his white lips . He said , " I feel giddy . What time is it ? " I looked at his watch and told him it was 4:15 . I dropped his gun in the snow at his bare feet and told him to do it right himself , if he wanted to . He thanked me and I waited in the car eating frozen fig bars from his pockets until the sun came up behind me and melted the ice from the blacktop. 67
