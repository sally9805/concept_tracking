FRIENDLY FIRE <P> by C.D.B. Bryan <P> 338 pages . Putnam. $10.95 . <P> <P> During the predawn hours of Feb. 18 , 1970 , on a jungle hilltop near the village of Chu Lai , South Viet Nam , an outgoing shell from a U.S. Army howitzer accidentally struck a treetop and exploded above the men of Charlie Company , 1st Battalion , Americal Division . Six were injured , two were killed . One of them was Michael Mullen , 25 , the fifth generation of his family to farm the same fertile Iowa acreage . Michael was pierced by a small crescent of steel that tore a hole in his heart . He was sleeping and died instantly . <P> The men were victims of what the Army called " friendly fire . " Back in La Porte , Iowa , Peg and Gene Mullen , Michael 's parents , found the term painfully offensive . Moreover , the Army had listed their son as a " nonbattle " casualty , a category that , the Mullens were to learn , was used rather loosely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Truly Sorry . C.D.B. Bryan 's Friendly Fire follows the Mullens ' travail step by step . A Connecticut-based novelist ( The Great Dethriffe , P.S. Wilkinson ) and stepson of the late John O'Hara , Bryan spent weeks interviewing the Mullens . He conducted his own investigation to corroborate the official version of how Michael was killed . Muffling his own indignation , he tells how the bureaucracy added insult to loss . An anguished war-protest letter from Peg Mullen to Richard Nixon brought back a note from a White House clerk assuring her the President was " truly sorry " that her son had died . Attached to the note were copies of Nixon 's " Vietnamization " speeches . Another letter from the Adjutant General 's office informed the Mullens that the " nonbattle " casualty had been posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Good Conduct Medal . Then Form 1174 arrived from Army Finance . It was a voucher that the Mullens were asked to sign in order to receive the pay due Michael at the time of his death . They refused to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a deduction for advance-leave time that their son was no longer in a position to make up . <P> The Mullens were unlikely protesters . Although Catholics and Democrats in a predominantly Protestant and Republican region , they shared the natural conservatism common to most farmers . The Mullens had reared their four children to obey the authority of man and God , and they were not self-conscious about admitting they belonged to the Silent Majority . Michael , the eldest , had been an outstanding 4-H Club member and even tried to persuade his parents to vote for Barry Goldwater in 1964 . When his draft notice came , he was a graduate biochemistry student who planned to take over the family farm .
