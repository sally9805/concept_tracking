The Olympic movement is perhaps the greatest social force in the world . It is a revolt against twentieth century materialism , it is a devotion to the cause and not the reward ... It appears as a ray of sunshine through clouds of racial animosity , religious bigotry and political chicanery ... <P> Avery Brundage <P> Honorary president of the <P> International Olympic Committee <P> RAY of sunshine , Mr. Brundage ? In Munich , the Yugoslav water-polo team lost a close contest to the Soviet Union . Displeased by defeat , the Yugoslav sportsmen spat on the Cuban referee and beat the daylights out of his bewildered brother . Pakistan , perennial power in field hockey , was upset in the Olympic final by West Germany , 1-0 . Pakistani fans nearly mobbed the referees , the players ridiculed the awards ceremony and roughed up a doctor at the doping tests , and eleven members of the team were forever banned from Olympic competition . Before the Games began , Black African nations , threatening a boycott , browbeat the I.O.C. into banning white-supremacist Rhodesia from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is currently exiling 55,000 of its Asian citizens . <P> Against this backdrop of political chicanery and racial animosity , in an atmosphere of intrigue and incompetence , the Arab terrorists committed their murderous assault on the Israeli athletes . Yet even apart from the horrifying massacre , the XX Olympiad has to rank as one of the sorriest athletic spectacles in history . True , hundreds of athletes did their human best , breaking dozens of world and Olympic records . Nonetheless , the impact of these extraordinary feats of strength , endurance and grace was marred by the chauvinistic stockpiling of team points , power politics , inept and prejudiced officiating , flagrant commercialism and oleaginous doses of carnival ballyhoo . <P> ? <P> These ills did not originate with the XX Olympiad . Since the Games were revived in 1896 , they have too often been used for purposes that stray far from their professed ideal . Adolf Hitler made the 1936 Berlin Games a platform for virulent Nazi propaganda ; in 1952 the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. began turning the Olympics into a cold war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a lot of subjective mischief in judgment events like boxing , have often been chosen more for their ideological loyalty than for their skill . As proved by Munich 1972 , the Games have become an extravaganza of hopelessly brobdingnagian proportions : 12,000 athletes from 124 countries competing in nearly 200 events , $650 million spent by the West German government alone , hucksters from myriad companies plugging their wares as if the Olympiad were a trade fair .
