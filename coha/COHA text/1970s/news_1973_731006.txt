txt AS the war in the Middle East continues in deadly fury , the question looms : Will the big powers find it in their interest to defuse the conflict , and on what terms ? ' i'ne soviet union ana me unites States have been trying to isolate the conflict from the larger concern of detente but , with both continuing to arm the combatants , it is urgently wondered here how long they can go on doing this . A senior U.S. official confirms a weekend report that the administration has made a decision to begin resupplying Israel 's battered Air Force with F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers and A-4 Sky Hawk attack planes . But it is not clear just when or in what quantity . So far the only confirmed resupply of the Israelis has been ammunition . Cease-fire bid due ? The decision to make good some of the aircraft losses ? variously estimated at between 75 and 100 ? came as it was reported that the United States and the Soviet Union are to seek a cease-fire in place in the next few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Henry A. Kissinger conveyed to Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban at a 40-minute meeting Saturday that the United States would honor its ongoing military-supply relationship with Israel but that the war should not be allowed to drag on indefinitely . Observers noted that a few hours after the meeting , Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir declared at a press conference that she was ready to enter cease-fire discussions . Boundaries of control A cease-fire in place would leave the Egyptians on both sides of the Suez Canal , in control of territory that had been occupied by Israel during the 1967 six-day war , and the Israelis in control of positions deep inside Syria. // *When will U.S. , Soviets call a halt to supplies ? // The resupply decision comes in the face of an ongoing Soviet airlift of military equipment to the Egyptians and Syrians . Although only several days ago Secretary of State Kissinger termed the airlift " moderate , " administration officials now stress it is continuing at a " fairly substantial rate " and warn it could create " very serious difficulties . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians have not shown more restraint in replenishing the Arabs . High U.S. officials say the Russians have not been very cooperative . And so ; for this reason , the administration is being forced to replace Israel 's Air Force losses . Intelligence estimates At the moment there is no indication that either side wants to stop fighting . Ironically , if the Soviet Union and the United States refrain from pouring military hardware into the region , the Israelis and Arabs would run out of supplies ? in a week or two , according to some Intelligence estimates . Some officials believe President Nixon may get considerably more outspoken about the Soviet role in the Middle East . If the Russian flow of munitions continues , they suggest , he may invoke the Declaration of Principles signed at the time of the first summit meeting in May , 1972 , That article pledges both sides to excercise restraint in their mutual relations and to refrain from efforts " to obtain unilateral advantage at the expense of the other . " In any event , as the conflict grinds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under increased pressure from Congress to get tougher with the Russians . Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington , in a speech planned for delivery in Los Angeles Sunday , was expected to denounce Soviet actions in the Middle East as reckless and to call for a substantial re-equipment of Israel . Officials are unwilling to discuss current diplomatic efforts to bring about a halt of the war , but Dr. Kissinger has been working virtually around the clock with a crisis task force on the Middle East called the Washington Special Action Group . The WSAC includes senior officials of the CIA , State Department , Department of Defense , and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . One problem in finding a formula for stopping the conflict is that the combatants on the Arab side have differing objectives . Cease-fire in place ? The Egyptians , ensconced on the east side of the Suez Canal and with their Air Force still intact , presumably would be willing to accept a cease-fire in place . This would give them a chance for a settlement on their aide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , under threat of becoming hostage to the Israeli forces , are in deeper trouble . Meanwhile , some experts on the Middle East voice concern that if the United States puts massive aid at the disposal of Israel , this could lead to a bloody slaughter in Sinai , with great losses to both sides . If the Egyptians , who gained a great psychological advantage by their well-executed military leap over the Canal , are killed in great numbers , say these experts , the Arabs will be under great pressure to make good their threat to cut off oil to the United States . Tel Aviv renews plea for negotiations Despite heavy fighting over the weekend on the Suez front and on the road to Damascus , Israel 's Prime Minister Golda Meir renewed Israel 's appeal for negotiations with the Arab states . Her comments indicated there has been neither a hardening nor a softening of the basic Israeli position on negotiations since the outbreak of the war Oct. 6 . In her first press conference since the start of the war , Mrs. Meir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can come to a peace agreement . " Israel would consider " any suggestion for a cease-fire , " she said . Same thing repeated ' " For six years , like parrots , we have been repeating the same thing : We want to live in peace , in cooperation , and in friendship . Therefore we say , ' Let us sit down as equals . Let us negotiate without preconditions . " And you know exactly what the answer was for six years : no negotiations : preconditions . ' Go back to the 1967 borders , and then maybe we will negotiate . Go back to the 1967 borders because it will be easier for us to attack you . ' " That , of course , we could not agree to , " Mrs. Meir said . Although the Prime Minister refrained from specifying Israel 's war aims , she stressed repeatedly that the guiding aim was " secure and defendable borders . " She intimated that the cease-fire line prior to the current war was of that " nature , " She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the current war ended . The question here of why Israel did not ' launch a preventive first strike is not dying down but rather increasing in intensity . // *Israel renews appeal for negotiations // Was it because Israel 's intelligence appraisal went wrong thins time ? Or was it because the government here decided not to strike first ? U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has blamed faulty Israeli appraisal of Egyptian intentions , while Mrs. Meir insists Israel 's stand came as a result of a " political decision . " Asked whether she " regretted " Israel 's not having launched a preemptive strike against the Arabs , the Prime Minister answered , " Yes and no . Yes , because had we done that there is no doubt that the position would have been much better , and I can say very openly and frankly that probably quite a few lives would have been saved . And no because at least we do not have that argument with the world as to who started this war . " Road to Damascus Israeli military experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the weekend failed to stop the Israeli thrust on the road to Damascus . Reports from the Suez Canal front have also become more encouraging , official spokesmen here state . True , the Egyptians succeeded in digging in along a sizable , though narrow strip of the eastern coast of the canal . They brought over an estimated 100,000 men and about 1,000 tanks , according to Israeli reports . But by doing this , they lost valuable time allowing the Israeli forces to recover from the Arab surprise attack of Oct. 6 . Reinforcements of Israeli armor , infantry , and artillery have arrived in substantial numbers and now are deployed in formations aimed at containing the Egyptians . Significant new tactic What is considered so far the most significant new tactic has been Egypt 's use of infantry against Israeli tanks . As in the 1967 war , the Israelis say , their tanks again have gained the upper hand over Egyptian armor . But this time Egypt 's infantry too has been fighting Israeli armor , using new Russian-type Shmel antitank missile guns , operated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . The Israelis are now reporting some success on the Suez front . They state that two Egyptian attacks ? one on Saturday , the other on Sunday morning ? were temporarily halted . They claim to have destroyed 70 to 80 Egyptian tanks .
