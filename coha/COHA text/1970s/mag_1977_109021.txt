Johnny Miller finally lost his short stroke in the land of the tall cactus . As every golf fan must know , Miller had won five of the six tournaments that had been held in Phoenix and Tucson from 1974 through 1976 and earned $176,150 in the process . He had been particularly devastating in Tucson , posting such numbers as 62 and 61 and letting it be known that in the wintertime , at least . Jack Nicklaus was only a trivia question . But then came 1977 , and when last seen Johnny Miller was nursing an illness he called " the mange " after apparently trying to see how many putts it would take him to play from a dry bed of the Santa Cruz River into the Bay of California . // In Phoenix two weeks ago , Miller started the year tying for 41st and earning $680 . That was surprising but not alarming . After all , the 1976 Phoenix Open had been the one Arizona tournament he had failed to win . What was atrocious , however , was how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had hardly ever lost anything but the field behind him . But last week he was just another guy out there in a tournament that succeeded despite the fact that it had Joe Garagiola 's name attached to it . Miller totally undazzled himself and the crowds by outdoing his performance of the previous week . This time he failed to finish , dropping out after four holes Sunday and crawling back to his casita only a few saguaros down the hill from the clubhouse. // For a while on Sunday it looked as if the tournament itself would not finish . Bruce Lietzke , a young fellow who seems to play almost as well in Arizona as Miller used to , had held the lead most of the way . Lietzke is a long-ball hitter out of the University of Houston whose name first became a spelling and pronunciation problem  --  say " lit-ski "  --  last year when he finished third at Phoenix and fourth in Tucson . Two weeks ago he finished fourth at Phoenix . // Lietzke needed only a par at the 72nd hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall into a tie with Gene Littler . He then had to go four extra holes at sudden death to win the tournament back , doing so by rolling in a 65-foot birdie putt at the 18th green , the kind that Johnny Miller , once upon a time , had made so often in the desert kingdom he has now relinquished . // One thing about Miller is that he manages to look the same and sound the same whether he is winning or losing or getting sick . Ever philosophical as he stood around Thursday afternoon fondling his once-loyal Bullseye putter , knowing he was already out of contention , he said : " Maybe I 'm starting out the way you 're supposed to . " // The way a mortal is supposed to , he meant . // Miller had an opportunity to do something in Tucson that had never been done in all the years since the tour came about . No one from Walter Hagen to Bruce Lietzke had ever won the same event at the same course four years in a row . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like it might be the place . Unfortunately for history , it only looked that way for a few moments on Thursday , the day Joe Garagiola officially became a singer or comedian or whatever you have to be to get your name on a tournament . // Miller was scheduled to go out very early on Thursday . In the luck of the draw he not only got an 8:34 a.m. starting time , but he also drew the 10th tee . A strange thing called frost delayed the start for about 30 minutes , but this had nothing to do with the chill that was to afflict Miller 's putter. // On his first hole of the tournament , a long , crooked par-4 . Johnny drove nicely enough and struck a decent enough four-wood second shot that settled on the green about 30 feet from the flag . He stroked his first putt toward the hole , and then an amazing thing happened . The ball did not go in the hole . In past years , whenever Miller putted , the ball went in . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th at Tucson was not a bad thing to have . But then came the first real indication of doom . // The 11th is supposed to give you a birdie even if a Gila monster gnaws on your Titleist between shots , because it is a par-5 reachable in two blows by little old ladies . Miller reached it with another good drive and another four-wood . He could sink the putt for an eagle , or at least two-putt for a birdie and would be on his way to one of those 62s . But Miller did not get an eagle . Nor did he two-putt . He three-putted , missing from three feet . And on the next hole , the 12th , he missed another three-footer for a par . Quite suddenly , then , he was one over par and on his way to a round of 74 , his first over-par score at Tucson National since Cochise was head of the greens committee . // " You ca n't explain why people putt badly at times , " Miller said . " It might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Phoenix I might be taking the club back too square . All I know is , George Archer felt sorry for me , looking at my stroke . " // Although he did not intend it as any sort of alibi , Miller said the Tucson course was not the same one on which he had shot those surreal scores , like the 62 in the opening round of the 1974 tournament and the 61 in the final round of the 1975 event . Grass matures , he said . There was more grass on the fairways now , making the layout play about 200 yards longer than it still measures . And the club had also toughened up a couple of holes by adding water hazards where , in the past , there had only been clusters of University of Arizona coeds. // None of the changes had anything to do with Miller 's lousy putting , however . There was no water on the 12th green where Johnny had blown his first putt for a par on Thursday  --  and where he removed all doubt about threatening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I 'm not spaz , " Miller said that evening , meaning spastic , even though he had turned a 14-foot birdie putt at the 12th hole into a double bogey . " I 'm happy with my game , and the putting will come back . I think the muscles in my back are a little tight . I 've been chopping down trees on my ranch . I do n't think I 'm getting the kind of body turn I 'd like . I 'm heavier , about 190 . I seem to gain about seven more pounds every year . My scores so far do n't look like it , but I came out really excited about this year . And I still am. " // Miller said he was already excited about the Masters , but he was trying to prepare for it differently , although he could n't say exactly how . " Maybe I wo n't go to Augusta a week early , " he said . " When I get somewhere a week early , I feel as if the tournament 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was going to play through the California part of the circuit and even go to Hawaii for the first time in a spell , then travel to Australia for the first time ever . " They want to see me , " he said with a grin . " To make sure of some contracts , I guess . " // Anyone wanting to see him Sunday morning in Tucson had to be quick about it . Because he was buried in the pack after rounds of 74-70-71 , Miller was obliged to tee off again at the 10th hole . He made a bogey . He did manage to birdie the pushover 11th , but then he was back at the good old 12th , with that wonderful green on which he had missed the shortie on Thursday and four-putted on Saturday . This time he three-putted from 15 feet . Then he three-putted for another bogey at the 13th and called it a day . // Whether it was here that he truly began to feel the effects of too many antibiotics , only Miller knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell and give you a clogged throat , which were what Miller complained of . // " I hated to pass up the $700 or $800 I could have won , " he said , " but I got out there today and I could n't hit the ball over 220 yards . Just no strength at all . I took too much medicine , I think . I 've got some kind of cold that must have settled in my left wrist . Do n't stand too close to me . You 'll catch the mange. " // Fair or not , it has become rather standard on the tour for golfers to " plead a Miller " when they begin to score badly . Johnny does have a tendency to blame his health for his poor showings . His withdrawal brought to mind the memorable words of Fred Marti in last year 's Tournament Players Championship . Marti led after 18 holes , but then he had a bad round . When Miller asked Marti what he had shot that day , Fred said , " I shot 74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anyone paused to think about what happened to Miller in the late stages of 1976 , his Arizona performance was perhaps predictable . While it looked as if it might be his year after he won the British Open , he followed it up by falling off a motorcycle and cutting his hand and having to skip the PGA . And after that he turned up at the World Series of Golf with one of his son 's toy putters in his bag , which , because it cost him a four-stroke penalty , ruined his chances of winning the year 's richest tournament before it had barely begun . // In Arizona it appeared as if Miller might have been putting with the toy , but all in all maybe Tucson was just another milestone in his career . For the first time , it was news when Jonny Miller lost a tournament .
