A war over Alka-Seltzer ? <P> <P> Bayer AG , the huge West German chemical firm , is best known in the U.S. for a product it has not owned for 60 years : its American rights to the name and trademark of Bayer aspirin were confiscated during World War I and thereafter given to Sterling Drug . Since the ' 50s , Bayer ( pronounced Buyer in Germany ) has been getting back into the U.S. market acquiring Mobay Chemical of Pittsburgh and Cutter Laboratories of Berkeley , Calif. , but it has never regained a significant position in U.S. consumer drugs . Last week it moved to do so , by offering " at least " $40 a share for a controlling interest in Miles Laboratories , Elkhart Ind. - based maker of Alka-Seltzer and One-a-Day vitamins . If Bayer bought all 5.4 million Miles shares , the purchase would swallow $216 million of the $500 million that Bayer has pledged to invest in the U.S. during the next five years . <P> Directors of Miles , which is dominated by three founding families , said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing unofficial proposals from other , unidentified suitors , also said to be European . Wall Street scented the prospect of a profitable bidding war , and arbitragers ( professional traders ) bought so much stock that Miles shares jumped from around $29 before the proposal to more than $42 ; last Friday it closed at $40 . <P> Miles is an obvious takeover target . Since 1972 its sales have grown from $316 million to $450 million , but profits have increased only from $15 million to $16.2 million . Acquisition of Miles would raise Bayer 's American sales to around $1 billion a year ( worldwide sales last year were $8.3 billion , and profits $181 million ) . But Bayer officials say that though they may go higher than their opening $40-a-share offer , they have no intention of getting into a long battle for Miles-and besides Washington trustbusters are examining whether the acquisition would violate antitrust laws . Should they oppose the takeover , the traders who have grabbed up Miles stock may need some of Alka-Seltzer 's plop , plop , fizz , fizz relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
