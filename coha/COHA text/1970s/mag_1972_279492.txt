" The right to leave and return to his country is a fundamental right of man , " declared Soviet Physicist Valery Chalidze on his arrival in the U.S. last month . In a highly unusual and seemingly liberal action , the Soviets had allowed Chalidze , an eloquent spokesman for the Russian civil rights movement , to travel to the U.S. for a monthlong lecture tour ( TIME , Dec. 18 ) . But early one morning last week , a consular official from the Soviet embassy in Washington , Yuri Galishnikov , called on Chalidze at his Manhattan hotel and amiably asked him to identify himself . When Chalidze handed over his passport , Galishnikov deftly passed it to an aide , who pocketed it . Chalidze was then told that he had been stripped of his citizenship by order of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet two days earlier , and was now forbidden to return home . <P> Galishnikov claimed that Chalidze had been guilty of " acts discrediting a Soviet citizen " while in America . A spokesman from the Soviet Mission at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Soviet citizen in his soul . " Chalidze pointed out that the substance of his lectures at U.S. colleges had been precisely the same as his earlier statements in Russia , when he appealed for amnesty for Soviet political prisoners and free emigration . <P> Chalidze , who was recently threatened with arrest in Russia for such statements , is now both bemused and bewildered . " Why did n't they simply imprison me at home instead of waiting to take away my citizenship while I am abroad ? " he asked . He intends to appeal the decision . If he fails , the highly trained scientist expects to stay in the U.S. with his wife Vera-and to ask the Kremlin for a bill for his higher education in a gesture of solidarity with Soviet Jews , who are often required to pay exorbitant " education taxes " when allowed to emigrate ( TIME , Sept. 25 ) . <P> Some Western observers speculate that the Soviets preferred to let Chalidze out of Russia in order to dump an embarrassing dissident . The next step , Sovietologists believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with followers in Russia by claiming that he acted disloyally in the U.S.
