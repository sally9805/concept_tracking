The case , said one U.S. intelligence expert , reaffirmed an old axiom in espionage : " Do n't go after the bosses-go after the file clerks . " Last week Christopher Boyce , 24 , was found guilty in a Los Angeles courtroom on eight counts of spying for the Soviet Union . He could be sentenced to as long as life in prison . No sooner was Boyce 's trial finished than the same judge and the same Government attorneys began taking part in a similar case against Andrew Daulton Lee , 25 . The Government charges that the two men-boyhood friends-had worked together to give the Soviets a top-secret feasibility study for a satellite spy system . <P> In the last days of his trial , Boyce surprised the courtroom by taking the stand and in effect admitting he had passed on information ( Lee so far insists that he is innocent ) . Boyce was apparently hoping he could win the sympathy of judge or jury by relating how he became a spy . The defendent told how his father-a former FBI agent - had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California defense contractor . With a " top secret " clearance , he began working in the communications " vault , " where he supervised the highly classified communications between TRW and CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . <P> Early in 1975 , said Boyce , he attended a party at the home of Lee , a convicted drug dealer who had violated his parole and was a fugitive . As the two drank wine and smoked pot late into the evening , the talk turned to politics and the complaints both had against the U.S. Government . " You ought to hear what the CIA is doing to the Australians , " Boyce told his friend . Then he cited materials that had crossed his desk at TRW telling how the CIA had infiltrated Australian labor unions. * <P> The two young men agreed that the matter should be made public , and Boyce provided Lee with a report spelling out his accusations against the CIA . But instead of publicizing the material , said Boyce , Lee took it to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Soviets liked what they saw and demanded more . <P> Pet Cat . The defendant testified that Lee next threatened to expose him if he refused to deliver other materials . Boyce cooperated , fearing blackmail and remembering Lee 's callousness as a child , when he shot his pet cat with an air rifle because it " bored " him . <P> Boyce admitted using a Minox camera he said was given him by Lee to photograph some IBM cipher cards and parts of a top-secret feasibility study of a satellite system . Furthermore , Boyce said he himself had made two trips to Mexico City and met Boris Grishin , the science attach at the Soviet embassy . The defendant acknowledged that he had received $15,000 , and said that Lee had received $61,000 . His main motivation in all this , Boyce maintained , was simply to " keep Lee off my back , " claiming that his old friend had even threatened to have him killed .                   @ @
