William Gaddis NOBODY GREW BUT THE BUSINESS A fragment from a novel , JR Mark Alan Stamaly The story begins at a point not much different from any other in the novel . People are talking about money , deals , art , love , companies , loss , sex , failure , rumor , and whatever else happens to pass through the confusion of memory . The entire book is of the same texture . In the absence of narrative structure , people talk , ceaselessly and at length , until the melodic lines of their many voices combine into a comic harmony . They stumble through their words in the same way they stumble through their lives , lying and dissembling , asking unprofitable questions , taking whatever advantage they can find in somebody else 's weakness or inattention . The novel is concerned with the financial success of IR , an eleven-year-old boy in torn sneakers who pyramids a speculation in Army surplus wooden picnic forks ( advertised on the back pages of a fan magazine ) into a multinational conglomerate of hideous size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be doing , JR begins by sending away for things in the mail .

Yes let me help you with your bundle you 're going to the elevators ? And you are Mister Bast I 'm Mister Brisboy from Wagner ... ? Yes now look Mister Brisboy I 'm leaving I 'm , I have to get uptown and I ca n't stop to ... ? Yes I 'll ride up with you here 's our elevator , we can have a delicious talk in the cab and you do need help with your things Mother 's found me a new analyst up at the corner of Ninety-fifth Street and I simply must ... companies that offer the rewards of a tax toss , and by so doing the conglomerate unwittingly acquires film studios , investment portfolios , a brewery , a manufacturer of plastic flowers , a New England mill town and miscellaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in looking through magazines , IR speaks to his various agents from a pay telephone in the corridor of his elementary school . Just as he acquires doomed enterprises so also does he employ failures of every conceivable description  --  widows , orphans , bankrupts , deadbeats , and teachers of extinct languages . The following scene takes place in a tenement on East Ninety-sixth Street in Manhattan , in a dingy apartment that has become the headquarters of the IR Corporation . Among those present are Edward Bast , a composer of baroque music and a victim of blackmail ; Rhoda , an urchin of indeterminate age ; and Jack Gibbs , a failed writer who , while waiting for the inspiration that never arrives , buys and sells things whose names he can seldom remember . ? Mister Brisboy listen I 'm about at the end of my ? Oh I understand Mister Bast that stuffy suite with all those crass people I took one look , we could n't have heard one another speak and there is so much to discuss do we go out this way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered with the most indecent and quite impractical suggestion I 'd quite despaired of ever ... ? Yes well listen I 'm in a hurry you do n't need to ? Simply abandon you here with this great big box I would n't dream of it , what can be in it ... ? Well it 's a , it 's just an Indian suit I ... ? An Indian suit how delish ! Oh it does sound like NOBODY GREW BUT THE BUSINESS a fun company after all there 's a cab oh cabby ? Cabby ? ? Mister Bisboy please I 'm , Brisboy listen why do n't you just get that cab and ... ? I 'd have to hurl myself under his wheels would n't I are n't they just obscenely rude with their little Off Duty signs is that the word your mother used too ? Oh wait here we are here we are ... no no get in back we 'll put your box up here in front with this savage at the wheel , there . Straight uptown driver , to the very fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What a cute outfit ... ? Yes well I , I thought you wanted to discuss some , to talk about the company or ... ? It 's all so exciting yes where shall we start , being asked to join your family of companies Mother feels that 's what we need and she 's never really been one for family if you could see Uncle Arthur , of course I wo n't go into some of the actual family members I 've just met with her except you of course if she found your JR person rather crass on the telephone I can imagine her reaction to your leg and tit person in there from Zanesville but ... ? To OUT , who ... ? ? Your wallpaper person he was discussing the menu with someone who said I 'm a ham and eggs man and he said I 'm a leg and tit man myself so crass not that unlike Uncle Arthur , he seems to expect your pushy little person with all the cuff links to fix him up with your blind lady person with purple lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how relieved I was to see another young face ... ? Yes well I , I 'd expected you to be a good deal older Mister Brisboy I thought Mister Crawley said that your , your business belonged to two brothers and when one died his widow wanted ... ? Oh he 's your stock person is n't he yes he sounds like an absolute bear no it was Daddy who died and Uncle Arthur wants out I ca n't tell you how relieved Mother and I will be to see him go if your Piscator person can arrange it , he sounds quite crass too is he ? And you must tell him to stop calling Mother Mrs Wagner every time he calls like Cosima if you please of course that 's where we got it if you knew the number of times I 've sat through Tristan with her five hours uncut at the Paris Op  --  ra simply relentless , she thought Brisboy sounded a little frivolous I suggested Charon of course but she found that a trifle recherche and felt Wagner might attract a nicer clientele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JR person in our mercifully brief telephone chat kept whining wag-ner wag wag like a doggy 's tail can you just lean forward and tap on the glass , oh driver ... ? Driver ? We 're not in a mad rush and we do n't want to suddenly become statistics Mother told me that 's what your JR person wanted me to discuss with you ? ? Yes well I hardly ? She said he sounded quite ecstatic to learn that two billion dollars was spent on funerals last year and you simply must tell him the death rate is climbing steadily imagine , only a hundred and eighty million funerals in America since our dear country was born and we counton two hundred million in just the next forty-five years ! ? Yes well I 'm , I know he 'll be delighted yes he .. E GET ONE OUT OF SIX NOW in the Fort Lauderdale area and Mother 's been constantly after me to bring in that second one to make it two out of six that would be one out of three , I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country but even the largest single chain has less than one percent of the trade were these the statistics you wanted ? Because even one percent just think the " Social Security persons estimate a twenty percent rise in the death rate between Nineteen-seventy and Nineteen-eighty so there should be enough to go round if we can trim some of these frightfully blatant costs we 've already tried working something out along the cluster concept so we would n't have ten hearses all out roaring down the roads at once and then all of them standing around empty waiting that 's why Mother 's so entranced with this package approach your JR person wrote her about does he do all his memoranda in lead pencil ? ? Yes well you see generally he ... ? Crabbed age and youth oh I know but what a delicious name to choose for your nursing homes someone 's been reading South Wind is n't it the most delicious book ever written ! Of course I 'd assumed it might be your JR person but when he misspelled nepenthe among other things and ... ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even heard of it no he just bought into this nursing home stock when it first ... ? How frightfully thoughtful of him yes all these old dear persons no one wants underfoot to pasture them off in great dank government hospitals at public expense would be quite unthinkable and simply reek of socialism of course free enterprise owes them the dignity of private care after all they 've done to make our dear country what it is and Mother tells me you have a Senator person leading the good fight for Eldercare so there wo n't be those dreary scenes over unpaid bills , and of course the idea of discreet signs placed tastefully about suggesting our services Mother was utterly charmed but I think not in the room itself do you ? No near the exits for visitors leaving that delicious old dear person all tucked up in beddy perhaps for the last time just a hint of stained glass and the simplest of messages Uncle Arthur suggested a hearse with the line getting there is half the fun so outr ? Mother and I thought simply Wagner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they are , of course we thought of when lie is but one really must tread on tippy toes it makes Him sound rather like an abductor do n't you think ? Or do n't you think ... ? Well I really do n't think ... ? No of course not Mother feels understatement is always best and I think she 's less than enraptured with your JR person 's notion of little booths set up in the nursing home lobbies to sell the entire package , prostheses the nursing care funeral plot and stone it sounds rather like a midway and of course the organized funeral directors are quite gaga over the whole thing rustling up pre-need laws and being most unfriendly but if the darkies have been getting away with their little burial societies for ages certainly anyone has the right to plan those delicious last moments at leisure with none of that frantic last-minute embarrassment over bills have you worked out the package cost ? ? No and I do n't ? Know how many packages you 'll offer no but there must be a mad variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burial I suppose they have in Russia Mother says your JR person wants to approach the young married market but projecting costs so far in the future when the average nine hundred seventy-five dollars now does n't even include vault memorial stone cemetery plot flowers burial clothing even the minister of course having the use of all that money for what might he simply ages before that last surprise party when the package is opened and with people rushing about so even that might happen in some utterly inaccessible place he almost seems to be counting on quite an eventual number of no-shows at your vast cemetery somewhere called Union forgive me was that your foot ? ? No it 's , it 's just my case let me move it I ... ? Oh I hope I did n't scratch it niy new heels are so dreadfully sharp here let me help you , your cabs here are so thrillingly efficient but there 's simply no place in them to sit down and my hat is getting careful , your important papers are spilling ... ? Yes it 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? He does sound like an absolute bear Mother said he oh ! It 's all music it 's simply filled with music oh I must see ! You did n't write it ? ? Well yes but it 's ... ? Oh let me see let me see this passage right here how simply delicious what part is it . ? That 's the , the harpsichord part it ... ? Mnimmtnnmumnimm ! delicious , yes there 's a little Rameau there is n't there mnunmmmrninmmrnmiurrun ? Well his , his piece The Gnat I just wanted the feeling of ... ? And you certainly caught it did n't you I feel prickly all over now what 's this oh how ominous ... ! ? Yes well that 's , that 's the string bass but about the cemetery I think you 'd better talk to Mister Hop ... ? Yes Mother said it was simply vast thousands of acres somewhere nearby called Union Falls ? that you 've taken over an entire right of way for it ? Mmmmm mmm mmmm hnimin ? Well it 's no not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right of way up near our ... MMMMM HMMMM HMMMM , TIMM way delicious M yes three thousand acres your JR person told Mother and imagine he 's concerned about unprofitable plots of course burying the welfare poor has always been a losing proposition simply noblesse oblige the agencies pay such a pittance but his proposal to make it pay by placing them six and eight deep to a plot when he was describing the entire package idea on the telephone as vertical integration Mother was simply aghast she thought he meant darkies and whites stacked in layers like a giant Dobos torte do n't you just crave one right now ? We could slip over to ... ? No , no I ... . ? The Hungarians are so clever with pastries but no NOBODY GREW BUT THE BUSINESS all he meant was getting into the monument trade he 'd just learned it runs over a third of a billion annually but you must tell him those monstrous granite memorials are quite quite passe the maintenance is simply prohibitive , you 'll want stones flush with the ground so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant , mmm mmnun mninimm mmmm mm mm m how simply brilliant and with your handicap Mister Bast oh forgive me , forgive me for mentioning it but I can only think of those cruel people telling Beethoven they heard shepherds ' pipes where he heard absolutely nothing and that heartrending will he wrote at the time of his exquisite second symphony you must n't think of taking your life Mister Bast you simply must not ... ? No well / , 1 had n't no I , driver ? ? To think of leaving the world before you 've brought out all you have within you no , no you must promise ... ?

Will you stop at this corner ? ? Now when am I to hear you play . ? I do n't know Mister Brisboy I have to go away for . ? Yes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have a piano hidden there ?

No that would n't no the piano is hidden yes it 's not ca n't be played no , no I 'll see you at the hotel Mister Bris ... ?
