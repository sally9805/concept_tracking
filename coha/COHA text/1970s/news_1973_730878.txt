txt One of the dirtiest of Watergate tricks was played today on one of the most " trusting of souls . " " It appears that a hoax has been perpetrated on the chairman of the committee , " said an angry , red faced Sen. Sam Ervin ID. , N. C.I Minutes earlier Ervin had dramatically announced that President Nixon had agreed to turn over personal tape recordings of Presidential conversations to Ervin 's Senate Watergate committee . " It is an awful thing for a very trusting soul like me to know there are human beings ? if you can call them that ' who would perpetrate a hoax such as this , " Ervin said . ERVIN HAD just learned that a telephone call he had re , ceived this morning informing him of the alleged decision by the President had been a phony . " Some people think the telephone is the instrument of the devil anyhow , " cracked Ervin . The telephone call , from a man identifying himself as Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz , was received by Ervin during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ervin that the President had decided to turn over the tape recordings and would meet with Ervin next week to discuss a procedure for doing SO . The committee had hoped to get the recordings without a legal confrontation with Nixon . The tapes could either substantiate or refute allegations by fired White House Counsel John W. Dean III that Nixon knew of the Watergate coverup . OBVIOUSLY buoyed by the news from the caller , Ervin announced the " decision " without checking with the White House . Ife followed it with a glowing statement heaping praise on the President . " I am very much gratified , " Ervin had said , " because the action will enable the committee to expedite its work . . . and was a very wise decision on the part of the President . " Within minutes of his statement  --  made at the beginning of the afternoon committee meeting ? Ervin was called from the committee room and told that White House Counsel Leonard Garment had informed his office that the President had not made a decision on the tapes . ERVIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no communication with the President and had not made the call to Ervin 's office . Said the real Shultz : " Whoever did it was somebody else . " " I hate to have my faith shattered . . . " , Ervin said , obviously shaken by his error . " My trust has been grossly abused . " Ervin said he was not familiar enough with Shultz 's voice to identify it and had " just assumed " that the caller had been Shultz . In an effort to salvage the situation , Sen. Howard Baker R. , Tenn. ) , committee vice .. , hairman , who also had made a statement praising the President and the committee , said he would stand by his congratulations just in case the President decided later to cooperate with the committee . Baker later announced that the FBI had begun an investigation of the hoax . EARLIER IN THE DAY , Ronald L. Ziegler , White House press secretary , had announced that the President planned to draft over the weekend his response to the committee 's written request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned a meeting with Ervin and was hopeful it could be scheduled next week . Disclosure of the existence of the tapes was made earlier this week by former White House aide Alexander P. Butterfield during a surprise appearance before the Watergate committee . Butterfield said the tape recordings , made of all Presidential conversations for " historical purposes , " probably would include those talks Dean said he had with the President concerning Watergate in the last six months . ALTHO SAMUEL DASH , deputy committee counsel , termed the incident of no real importance and just " another ripple in the stream of events , " Baker immediately requested a Justice Department investigation of the incident . Such a probe was launched immediately but no one expressed any hope that the identity of the caller , who was described as a " very believable " mimic of Schultz , could be determined . No longer taking anything for granted , newsmen asked if by chance the Watergate committee did not automatically record every conversation by every committee member . Sighed Dash , with a smile : " Heavens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
