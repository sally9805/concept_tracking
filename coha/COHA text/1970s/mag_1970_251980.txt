THE FILE ON STANLEY PATTON BUCHTA by Irvin Faust . 274 pages . Random House . $5.95 . <P> Good-looking , personable Stanley Patton Buchta , the lead in Irvin Faust 's second novel , practices a special kind of fantasy . He believes in little except himself . Unfortunately , that self is mainly composed of pop-culture fragments , miscellaneous emotions and loose social ties . A New York City policeman who was raised in California and saw combat with the Army in Viet Nam , Stanley is an American tumbleweed of no discernible ethnic background . He is a composite of what Author Faust apparently takes to be typical urban America-rootless , tough , guiltlessly selfish and easily moved by chance winds . <P> After the Army , Stanley drifted into college on the G.I. Bill . He dropped out just as easily to join the police force after aiding three patrolmen who had been attacked by a street mob . Being a policeman is simply a job . Stanley performs it with the same detached competence he displayed shooting Vietnamese . But the civil service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Racism and radical politics have besieged its encrusted prerogatives and cherished prejudices . Many policemen respond to the situation by joining Alamo , an unofficial organization dedicated to superpatriotism and the myth of the white man 's burden . Alamos take solemn loyalty oaths and watch slides of the Boxer Rebellion . One member pines for the time when " Watts was the plural of a unit of electrical power " and " Detroit was a baseball team . " For security reasons , all assume code names , such as MacArthur ( Douglas ) , Crockett ( Davy ) , Wayne ( John ) and Roosevelt ( Theodore ) . History and Hollywood are given equal credibility ratings . <P> Polarized Women . Stanley , out of the inertia of good-fellowship , shuffles into this scene and is given the name Scott ( Winfield ) . Then he is selected by the chief inspector to infiltrate the Brothers Under the Constitution , a group of radicals bent on preventing the construction of a school on Randall 's Island . Without any convictions to mask , Stanley has little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarized in Stanley 's life is his women . Heidi from Queens is sweet , roundish and compliant . Darleen from Harlem is bitter , lithe and defiant . Why does she go out with <P> Stanley ? " Well , " she tells him , " I am curious , black . " <P> Faust 's characters frequently define themselves through movie references . Much of the novel , in fact , could be regarded as a highly inventive , sardonic paraphrasing of Zulu , a 1964 Technicolor extravaganza about the bloody exertions of a British outpost to defend itself against human waves of frenzied black warriors . This particularly holds for the novel 's ending , a melodramatic surrealization of a ghetto uprising . <P> Pathetic Realities . Although Faust dramatizes-and frequently overdrama-tizes-the tragic preposterousness of all extremism , he is never a cold-blooded satirist . He understands why people do what they do because he understands and respects their passions-or lack of them . A guidance counselor in a New York area high school , he previously brought his tart brand of empathy to bear in Roar Lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steagle , his first novel .
