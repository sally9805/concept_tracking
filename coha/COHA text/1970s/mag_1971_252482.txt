A new neighborhood newspaper called Wisdom 's Child , published on Manhattan 's Upper West Side , begins by noting that life there " can be a delightful thing . " That said , the editors offer a cutout page of emergency telephone numbers-for firemen , police , suicide prevention , addict assistance , a 24-hour locksmith , air pollution , a poison-control center and dial-a-prayer . The recorded prayer : " Oh Lord , I am very aware that I live in a world of muggers and purse snatchers . I earnestly pray for help to keep my perspective . . . and even if I am a victim of a crime , that I might pray for those who have thus abused me. "
