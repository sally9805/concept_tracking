THE NIGHT I GRADUATED from Polytechnic High School in 1947 , I split out the back of the auditorium ( thinking , Damn , I 'm free , got my diploma and did n't mess up , can sleep till twelve tomorrow ) , threw my cap and gown in the back of the Ford , and made it only fifteen minutes late to The Last Word , where I was working with the Jay McNeeley band . A few months later I joined Red Norvo 's group at Cafe Society in San Francisco . I could n't read chords too well at the time and had to rely on my ear . Whenever I played a wrong chord , Red ? he had a big pot belly then ? would turn round , bug his eyes , wave his mallets at me , and go , " Accchhh ! " I hated that bogeyman stuff , but it 's partly the reason I hear so good today . Billie Holiday was working opposite us , sounding so good , like her heart was breaking on every tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; carried around a pair of those little dogs you put sweaters on , At that time she was already famous , and narcotics agents were harassing her . She got so she could spot them at fifty feet through a haze of smoke . " See the little cat drinking 44 Manhattans , the one in the brown suit ? Po-lice , " she 'd say . She could be tender , and she could show a temper that would scorch you . " I 'm gon na come down off this stand and kick your ass , " she said to a chick who had been talking nonstop through her opening-night show ; and afterward she told the bass player , who liked to stretch out behind singers , " Why you have to play so wild ? Cut out that devil music . " That cat took it so to heart he just looked at her and his eyes filled with tears . Later that night some of the musicians were arguing in the band room when she hollered from her dressing room ? banging on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there . " They yelled back , " Shut up yourself , broad . " " Come in and make us . " We heard her door slam , and a second later she came barging into our room in her draws . She was big and strong , had some righteous meat on her , and those cats flattened against the wall , grinning . their arms raised . I watched it all from my chair in the corner . She glared a minute , then walked back out , saying to me , " You do n't need to flinch , baby , I know it was n't you . " From that night on she began dropping by the piano after her show , when I would play intermission music . Would lean over me and say stuff like , " You 're about the quietest , sweetest cat I ever seen , you play so pretty . Takin ' care of business and not chasin ' the scroungyass bitches that come in here . " She was always having trouble with men when she went for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with him , and he usually had the bag narcotics and works ? but I was young , never jived or bothered her , and maybe that was why she liked Hampton Hawes was featured last summer at the Montreux ( Switzerland ) Jazz Festival .

Copyright ? 1974 by Hampton Hawes and Don Asher . I I to come over and talk . She made her business to see that the chic who hung out in the club did n't h on me . " You leave him alone , he nice , keep your funky hands off him I had the feeling she hoped would n't have to go through any be changes , almost like a mother an ious for her son to steer clear of boo . and drugs and sin ; did n't want an one polluting me . I did n't realize the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd eventually ha ' to go through it ; you got to wac through a certain amount of mud get to the pearls . One afternoon , toward the end the gig , some agents broke down tl door of her motel room looking f= dope .

They busted her . but a go ( criminal lawyer up there got her o After the San Francisco gig we cross paths now and then .

" " Right , and I 'm onna turn the motherfucker in the ck , " I said , and split . Later , taking le of those looks into the future Erich you try to shut off because it 's auded with pain , I realized I was ' obably going to have to get locked ) and the key stashed out of reach order to really get it together . ) I had just wandered into the Clevend Airport cocktail lounge ? on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big lady , familiar heft to at the end of the bar . I went over her , thinking of those early days - ten she was watching after me , try-g to keep me pure and free of sin . " Hey , Billie . " She looked at me a long time be-re she said , " You too , baby ? I d n't think it would ever happen to ou . " Probably had heard I was rung but did n't believe it , rememTing me as a nice , together teen- ; e kid playing pretty tunes at Caf ? xiety . I said something , asked her where e was headed . " I thought you were going to get = , " she said , and the tears came in-her eyes . Still wanting me to escape all that . tt you ought to know , you went rough the same garden , went out the rain and got wet , how was I pposed to stay dry ? There was nothing I could tell her . few minutes later she got on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her . Three years later I was back in n-t . Worth ? involuntarily : ten years r sticking a needle in my arm , and at 's some cold shit . I had just writ-a a letter to the Attorney General telling him a dime was a long time for what I did , the days were moving slow , and would he send me some information about how I could get out before 1968 , when I read in the paper that Billie had died in a New York hospital room guarded by city police . They had hounded her to the end of her days , but despite what the obituaries and the movie said , I know she died because she was too emotional and bighearted , always racing . She lived her life so full it was inevitable she would go down fast . Not long afterward , the Attorney General 's office wrote me a polite letter saying , Man , do n't bother us . A S A KID I used to think my father , a righteous faith-dealing Presbyterian minister , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sundays were sacred and fucked up for humans . But I was n't to meet God , or a facsimile of Him , till 1947. when I ran into Charlie ( Bird ) Parker at the Hi-De-Ho Club at 50th and Western in L.A. , playing alto sax with the Howard McGhee band . When 1 had first heard Bird at Billy Berg 's two years earlier could n't believe what he was doing , how anyone could so totally block out everything extraneous , light a fire that hot inside him and constantly feed on that fire . Now at the time there were maybe ten people in the neighborhood of 50th and Western who knew there was a genius playing alto in our group . Most people who had heard him thought he was crazy . His playing was too free and blazing and pure : it could be dissonant and harsh on the ears if you were n't accustomed to the sound . Bird had already recorded those early classics with Dizzy , but you could n't find the records on any jukeboxes . Today the deejays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ; before you know it you 're on television beaming to thirty million people . But this was before TV , and jazz was years away from reaching the concert halls . The only people in the vicinity of 50th and Western who were hip to Bird were a few of the street people , one or two chicks at the house where he was staying ? the woman who owned it , a madam with a whorehouse on the East Side , was a good friend of his and put him up whenever he was in town ? and , of course , other musicians . When word got around where he was playing they came to check him out . Motherfuckers peeked and backed right up . Those of us who were affected the strongest felt we 'd be willing to do anything to warm ourselves by that fire , get some of that grease pumping through our veins . ( Almost everybody I knew was using heroin at that time . Some were turned on by Bird ? not by him directly , but reasoning that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get closer to the source of his fire . Some learned , and others never did , that junk has no more to do with playing good than the make of your car or the shade of your skin . I knew a lot of strung-out dudes who could n't play shit ; they should have just got high and enjoyed themselves and forgot about playing . If you ca n't swing , you ca n't swing . You can stuff your stomach with black-eyed peas and chitlins , go out and roll in the mud , and say I 'm gon na get down soulful but it ai n't going to help if you do n't pat your feet right , because chitlins have no more to do with soul than mud has to do with music . ) Bird was indirectly responsible for all the trips I would eventually go on . He fucked up all our minds . It was where the ultimate truth was . As with anyone that heavy and different , some people were awed or afraid of him and kept their distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang out , figuring if they were around him long enough some of his shit was bound to rub off on them . I watched motherfuckers write down his solos note for note , play them on their own gigs , and then wonder why they did n't sound as good . And if they had to follow Bird 's solo with their own stuff , that would really leave them exposed ? like standing naked and wet in a cold wind . Bird would take advantage of these dudes , borrow money and burn them in various ways . It was n't that he was a bad cat , any junkie would do the same thing . It was a matter of dope or no dope ; survival . Bird was out and he was strung , and in order ? to be around him you had to contend with that . He was a sad driver ? when his two-year-old car fell apart he left it in the street ; borrowed mine once and tried to shift without using the clutch ? so I 'd pick him up every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford , take him to work and bring him back . When I came early one 47 night he motioned me to follow him to his room . I waded through piles of sandwich wrappers , beer cans , and liquor bottles . Watched him line up and take down eleven shots of whiskey , pop a handful of bennies , then tie up , smoking a joint at the same time . He sweated like a horse for five minutes , got up , put on his suit , and a half hour later was on the stand playing strong and beautiful . For two weeks he never said a word to me ? going to the club , on the stand , or driving home . But it was n't an uncomfortable silence ; he was either stoned , froze , or just off somewhere else , and I respected whatever trip he was on and what . ever distant place it carried him to . It was never the kind of ego trip that led many of the East Coast musicians to shoot down anyone new on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-out tunes in strange keys with the hip changes at tempos so fast you either flew or fell . Jump , chump , or burn you up , you do n't know nothin ' . It 's too bad it had to be that way , ambushing outsiders and cutting them up to make them feel inferior so they could get better . That is n't what music is about . You play for love and for people to enjoy . It 's okay to show a few feathers , you got to have pride in yourself , but you should n't have to wear boxing gloves and spurs ; this ai n't no cockfight or main bout at Madison Square Garden . We 're all brothers , are n't we ? ? came up the same way , earned our diplomas listening , picking up , hanging out , nervous , some of us getting busted . Yet when I think back , the system did serve a purpose . Blacks in those days had to bear down hard to handle the shadow that was always haunting them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned recognition and respect . In the process the music grew leaner , tightened up ; the ones who did n't have it . who could n't contribute , fell away . If you do n't have ereedentials , stay off of Fifth Avenue . If you asked Bird who he liked better on alto , Henry Prior or Sonny Criss it was the sort of thing a young player starting to come up would ask ? he 'd shrug and say , Both . They 're both cool . Shooting down other players was as foreign to his nature as longing for sharp clothes and a Cadillac or caring whether or not he had a white woman , which were the badges of black success in those days . He had plenty of white women , but that interfered with his music . Sometimes I 'd pull up in front of the club and he 'd be too high to get out of the car . Howard McGhee would ask me where Bird was . I 'd say , Sittin ' in the car . No point in trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play anyway . After a while he 'd get himself together , walk in , and start blowing ? even before he reached the stand , weaving his way through the tables playing in that beautiful , fiery way . At the end of the second week of the gig , he spoke his first words to me . It was close to three in the morning when I left him off at the madam 's house . He got out , started walking toward the house , then stuck his head back in the window and said , " I heard you tonight . " The next day I told the guys in the hand I was going to drop by Bird 's place and see if he wanted to go to a movie . Everybody said , That 's a dumb idea , he is n't going to want to go to any show . That 's too square for him , too bourgeois . I dropped by anyway . He came to the door in a T-shirt and the same pin-stripe suit he wore on the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like a good idea . We went to a newsreel playing nearby . As I was buying my ticket I realized Bird was no longer with me . Looked up and down the street and saw him coming out of an alley halfway down the block . He wandered up to the box office and laid out his money , not saying anything about the little side trip . Afterwards we ate a hot dog and drove around downtown in my Ford , enjoying the spring day . When I dropped him off back at the house he said he 'd had a nice time . That weekend I smoked my first joint , some light green from Chicago Bird pulled out as we were driving down Avalon Boulevard to get a hamburger and Coke . Did n't feel anything till after we ate and I started driving home . I said , " Man , why are all these horns honking at me ? " Bird said , " You 're driving backwards . " I stopped and let him take over the wheel . He made it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked the ten blocks to my house and was weaving up to the door when I saw a tiny old lady from my father 's church staring at me . Watched me trying to make it to the door and said , " Young man , are you behaving yourself ? " I made it up the stairs , lay down under the bed , and getting a flash from the old church days asked God aloud to deliver me from the devil . Next day Bird phoned and said , " That was some powerful light green . " IN 1952 I WAS stationed at Fort Ord , winning marksmanship medals . As a kid I had spent a lot of summers at Lake Elsinore hunting jackrabbits and quail with my father . My platoon officer , an old cracker from Texas , said , " Hawes , how come you shoot so straight , you 're supposed to play that boogie-woogie ? You keep hittin ' that bull 's eye like you were one of Nimitz 's boys at the Mariana Islands turkey shoot . " Whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco to cop buy dope and jam . Bird was working at Jimbo 's , an after-hours club in San Francisco , at the time and if he knew I was looking to score he 'd say in his stagy , put-on way , " I have n't messed with anything along those lines in a long while but what I can do is make a call for you . " He 'd see me at Jimbo 's later ? from two in the morning on was the heavy time , when the cats would get off their gigs and come to jam and the chicks would show ? and say , " The cat 's out in the alley , you can cop for 25 cents $25 . " I 'd say did n't have 25 cents , which may not have been true . Usually I 'd already copped , could have used more , but I knew there was a good chance Bird might burn me ? knew what I might have done in similar circumstances . If I said , " I only need a dime 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm low myself , make it two dimes and we 'll cow pool resources to buy dope . " Of course if I went for that it was unlikely I 'd ever see that second dime . It was survival of the fittest , and you had to know where people were coming from . ( We hustled and schemed like a motherfucker in those days . and I think that if we could have directed all that drive and con into legitimate channels those of us who survived might be worth a cool million today . ) In March of 1955 I was in the California Club on Santa Barbara Avenue , where my friend Wardell Gray had the band , when the news broke . Wardell was called to the phone and when he came back a few minutes later he was blinking and fussing with
