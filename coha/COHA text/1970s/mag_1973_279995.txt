GHOSTS by HENRIK IBSEN <P> A young man returns from Paris to the small Norwegian town of his birth and tells his mother that syphilis has doomed him to madness and death . <P> Mind you , he never uses the word syphilis . His mother obliquely informs him that his pitiable fate is a hereditary legacy from his late father , a sordid libertine . The height of Victorianism ( 1881 ) was not the best possible time to treat such matters on a public stage , and the vituperative abuse heaped on Ibsen for his effrontery has probably never been equaled in the history of drama . <P> Not surprisingly , the passage of nearly a century has robbed Ghosts of its shock effect ; it has also clarified our vision of the play . Obvious now is the fact that syphilis was Ibsen 's symbol rather than his subject . The disease stands for all that is twisted and stunted when life is held in thrall by narrow , provincial social conventions . People in such a society , Ibsen shows us , are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrisy . <P> Ibsen 's theme is universal . In American terms , it means that Ibsen would approve Sherwood Anderson 's vision of the crabbed , tormented , camouflaged souls of Winesburg , Ohio , rather than the blithely idealized innocents of Thornton Wilder 's Grovers Corners . In European terms , James Joyce perhaps came closest to Ibsen when he wrote , " Ireland is the old sow that eats its own farrow . " <P> Joyce idolized Ibsen , and the two artists have much in common . Like Joyce , Ibsen lived by " silence , exile and cunning , " fleeing Norway to live abroad for 27 years . Both men abandoned their native countries physically and yet were able to repossess and be possessed by them psychically and aesthetically . As a parallel to the Greek dictum " Know thyself , " both Ibsen and Joyce say " Free thyself . " This is no faddish preachment to " do your own thing " but a call to an austere heroism and indomitability that dares to stand alone . <P> The finest compliment one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all the Joycean echoes in Ibsen . When it falters , it is simply that few actors are intrepid enough to scale the sheer rock face of Ibsen 's perdurable realities . T.E.K.
