IN a speech before the Detroit Economics Club two days before the latest housing scandals broke , George Romney , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , made a remarkable admission : he suggested that his agency did not necessarily know what it was doing . There is no agreement , even in principle , about how to deal with ghetto neighborhoods , Romney indicated . Said he : " We need to make the hard analysis that we do n't yet know how to solve this mounting crisis of people with problems in our central cities-but we must find out before it is too late . Failure to do so could result in a fatal national crisis . " <P> He also conceded that in practice there have been " flagrant abuses " of housing programs in ghetto areas of large cities . He blamed " speculators and fast-buck artists " but accepted some of the blame himself for the failure of the FHA , which his department supervises , to combat them . Said he : " I am angered and determined to eliminate incompetence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud , shoddy workmanship and profiteering . " <P> Romney defended the FHA for its willingness to insure home mortgages in high-risk areas when private lenders had long refused to do so . " Our department has made mistakes , " Romney said , " but we will not abandon the central city as so many have done . " HUD , he insisted , will " not abandon even a single house-we either rehabilitate and sell it , or we demolish it . " <P> Romney argued that housing is not the cause of urban decay . " We will not solve this crisis if we pretend that it is just a housing crisis . Housing did n't take the jobs away . Housing did n't reduce the population . Housing did n't bring the drug addiction . " <P> One of the major agonies of inner cities , Romney said , is that " a new barrier of fear has emerged " between the cities and their " balkanized suburbs . " This is because the cities contain a " confined concentration of people with problems . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a real menace to their neighbors . We have not been able to get at the social causes of this socially demoralized group-and we do not know how to protect the much larger group of working poor and dependent poor , as well as moderate-income families , from these everyday experiences that generate fear . " <P> Romney suggested that this " real menace " of a few may lead others to consider all ghetto dwellers as similarly fearsome . There is a danger , he said , that the cities may be left with only " a black minority held back from entrance into broader society , not only by racial prejudice and economic classism , but by the growing fear stereotype that unfairly labels them with social menace . " None of that , said Romney , can be dealt with " by hiding behind scapegoats - whether Secretary Romney , HUD , the Nixon Administration or any other available target . "
