At 74 , Senator Samuel J. Ervin Jr . looks and sounds like the quintessential Southern Congressman . Jowls drooping and eyebrows cascading , he drawls tall tales about good ole boys back home in hill-country North Carolina . In rambling Senate speeches , he quotes the Bible , Jefferson and Kipling ; he opposes most civil rights bills and accuses the Supreme Court of killing the Constitution 's meaning by " verbicide . " But for all his Claghornian pomp and ceremony , Sam Ervin is no archetypal Southern reactionary . He is in fact one of the Senate 's ablest civil libertarians . <P> As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights , Ervin has long taken positions that startle conservatives and liberals alike . Despite his Bible-Belt constituency , he successfully opposed the late Senator Everett Dirksen 's proposed amendment that would have allowed voluntary prayers in public schools . " I believe in a wall between church and state so high , " says Ervin , " that no one can climb over it . " Though a strong law-and-order man , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill with its controversial " no-knock " and preventive-detention provisions . He called it " a garbage pail of some of the most repressive , intolerant , unfair and vindictive legislation that the Senate has ever been presented . " <P> Dossier Dictatorship . More recently , Ervin has criticized two institutions that most conservatives hold dear : the FBI and the U.S. Army . He accuses both of snooping on Americans in ways that endanger First Amendment freedoms of speech , thought and privacy . " If we are going to be a free society , " says Ervin , " the Government is going to have to take some risks ; they ca n't put everyone under surveillance . " <P> Last week Ervin 's subcommittee began hearings on his biggest concern to date : how to safeguard the political liberties of U.S. citizens from what one witness called " dossier dictatorship " - the vast files that are now being computerized by assorted snoopers , ranging from credit bureaus to Army agents , who allegedly concentrate their spying on war protesters . Dramatizing his worries about computers , Ervin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of microfilm , each containing 773,746 words . " Someone remarked that this meant the Constitution could be reduced to the size of a pin-head , " he drawled . " I said I thought maybe that was what they had done with it in the Executive Branch because some of those officials could not see it with their naked eyes . " <P> Linguistic Abomination . Ervin has been a wide-eyed lover of law ever since his childhood in Morganton , N.C. ( pop . 13,000 ) . As a boy , he hung around the Burke County courthouse watching his lawyer father argue cases dressed in Victorian cutaway tails . After graduating from Harvard Law School ( ' 22 ) , Ervin married his home-town sweetheart , joined his father 's law firm , and polished his oratory as a young state legislator . He once quashed a bill that would have outlawed the teaching of evolution in public schools with the objection that " such a resolution serves no good purpose except to absolve monkeys of their responsibility for the human race .
