' This decision by United States Magistrate Vincent A. Catoggio followed the testimony of 40 prisoners who said they had been lined up and beaten . They had testified at hearings before the magistrate that opened May 4 and ended July 16 after Federal Judge Orrin G. Judd had heard earlier testimony on a civil suit filed by three prisoners in Brooklyn . Judge Judd assigned the hearing on brutality charges to Magistrate Catoggio after the suit was amended on behalf of all . other inmates as a class action . The inmates were represented by the Legal Aid Society . Magistrate Catoggio , who was appointed last January by the eight Eastern District judges , sat as a master in the hearings . The ultimate decision will be made by Judge Judd . Those named as defendants were Correction Commissioner George F. ; John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warden ; District Attorney Thomas J. Mackell of Queens and Mayor Lindsay . Although the Mayor was named , the complaint did not expressly seek relief from him . The plaintiffs sought an injunction that would restrain Mr. , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ossakow from " initiating any physical attacks , " require them to " take appropriate measures " to insure the plaintiffs ' safety and require the defendants to inform the court of beatings of inmates . As to Mr. MackeII , the complaint asked that he be enjoined from prosecuting indictments filed against Donald Leroland , Ralph Valvano and Richard Flowers for bribery and from " intimidating plaintiffs ' witness " by initiating criminal prosecutions against them . Rejects Intimidation Magistrate Catoggio found that those indictments had been dismissed and that there was no credible evidence of intimidation . To the contrary , he held , the record showed that 24 of the 40 inmates who testified for the plaintiffs were allowed to plead to charges less than those contained in their indictments . The 54-page ruling noted that Correction Department regulations in force at least since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under stated circumstances . " The magistrate pointed out that " several " guards in Manhattan were being prosecuted on a charge of violating those regulations . He declared that major disorders had occurred last October at all four Correction . Ded partment facilities , where host- , ages were seized in Long Island City , the Brooklyn House of Detention and the Manhattan House of Detention ( the Tombs ) , and at the Queens House of Detention in Kew Gardens .

Fifty-nine inmates were hospitalized , " many of whom were injured by inmates , " the magistrate said . The magistrate declared that the city detention houses were " scandalously overcrowded " last October , and that the fault lay in the workings of the courts . Some inmates were awaiting disposition of their cases since 1968 , he said . He determined that the guards , in taking over , " did not embark on a wild , club-swinging , head-breaking orgy which the filed complaint suggests . . . and that they used only such force as was necessary . " He challenged as a crucial issue the credibility of plaintiffs ' witnesses , particularly on their claims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that a witness 's propensity to assault others as evidenced by his convictions for murder , manslaughter , felonius assault and the like must be considered in weighing the truthfulness ' of evidence as to who was the aggressor and who was the assaulted one , " he wrote . The magistrate singled out as the ringleader and " moving force " behind the riot Ralph Valvano , a 27-year-old drug addict who has spent 10 of his 27 years in prison . He accused Valvano of lying and urging inmates to lie . He labeled Valvano " an egotist who clearly reveals that his will is not to be thwarted " and found that he " really started the riot " by breaking windows and throwing chairs down a stairway . Magistrate Catoggio charged : that Valvano and his cronies " devised a brazen fraud and base fabrication and they have ' attempted a colossal hoax to prevent both the District Attorney 's office and the grand jury from taking any action on the riot . Magistrates may try misdemeanor charges without a jury where the punishment does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $1,000 in fines . They may also sit as masters in civil matters , hearing evidence and reporting their findings to a district judge for ultimate decision .
