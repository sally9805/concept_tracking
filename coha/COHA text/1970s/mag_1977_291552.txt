Reactions to the Carter plan from TIME 'S Board of Economists : <P> Most emphatic in support of the energy package is Joseph Pechman of Washington 's Brookings Institution , who has repeatedly urged the adoption of two of the program 's main elements : an additional federal tax on gasoline and an excise tax on big gas-gulping cars . Pechman concedes that the plan will add " moderately " to the inflation rate , but contends that somewhat higher prices are part of the cost the nation must pay to resolve its " most serious problem . " The program should have little or no impact on economic growth , Pechman asserts . Harvard University 's Otto Eckstein also believes the plan is workable . If enacted by Congress , he says , the package would add no more than seven-tenths of one percentage point to living costs between now and 1980 . Automakers would be hurt , but not disastrously . Though sales of small models would climb under the plan , Eckstein sees a net sales drop of 300,000 U.S.-made cars a year and Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they would otherwise be through 1980 . <P> Walter Heller of the University of Minnesota , Arthur Okun of Brookings and Washington Consultant Robert Nathan , all Democrats , see potential flaws in the plan . The program 's proposal to return money collected in higher gas and crude oil prices in the form of tax credits to consumers will , in Okun 's view , boost living costs , kick up wage demands and add to the Consumer Price Index . All three members would prefer that the Government use the additional tax revenues to help keep the C.P.I , down-either by paring payroll taxes or by returning the money to states to allow them to lower sales taxes . <P> Far from satisfied with Carter 's energy proposals are the Republican members-Alan Greenspan , who was President Ford 's chief economic adviser ; Beryl Sprinkel , executive vice president of Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank and Murray Weidenbaum of St. Louis ' Washington University . Their main complaint : the program 's failure to put enough emphasis on increasing energy supplies by eventually lifting all controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Sprinkel : " It 's backward economics . We 're not allocating enough resources for investment . " In addition , Greenspan fears that the program will create a new bureaucracy , add to businessmen 's uncertainty and result in a continuing lag in much needed investment in plant and equipment in all segments of industry . Says Greenspan : " The view that somehow this program is going to enhance growth is to me an utterly noncreditable notion . " <P> Even so , Okun believes the program is essential if the nation is to have " insurance against an energy catastrophe . The question now is whether the American people will have enough maturity to act before the crisis hits . "
