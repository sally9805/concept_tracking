Though Arthur Burns is often described as a hidebound , conservative economist , his writings , speeches and personal remarks reveal that his interests are more catholic and his thinking more flexible than many of his critics suggest . Samples : <P> ON ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT : Anyone who is convinced that he can fine-tune the economy does n't know what he is talking about . <P> ON UNEMPLOYMENT : An unemployment rate of 4.5% or 5% is high for any country , and it is uncomfortably high for a nation that aspires to greatness . <P> ON A FREE ECONOMY : The public interest would be well served if the Government proceeded to reduce tariffs , eliminate import quotas , reduce farm price supports , discourage restrictive work practices , reform the minimum wage , and enforce the antitrust laws more strictly . <P> ON SECRECY : I believe in telling as much as you can about Federal Reserve policy , but there are certain things that you can not disclose because of their effect on the markets . If you tell precisely what you plan to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and those who lose will be the little guys who do not get the word . <P> ON THE PRESIDENCY : It 's a terribly lonely job being President . He is surrounded by yes men who try to find out what the boss wants and give it to him . They do n't protect him sufficiently from daily follies and lapses of judgment and temper . There is also a tendency for some political people to try to screen the President from the outside world , and defend him no matter what . It 's no different in any administration . <P> ON STUDENTS : The number of years spent by students in our universities is excessive . Young people now mature physically at an earlier age than before , but we keep them in a university longer than we used to . Furthermore , if we saw to it that students got part-time jobs or loans on a needed scale , we could do away with scholarship programs . We have made them unnecessarily dependent on the Government , on foundations , or on us as parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to legitimate demands for change , or the tensions set up by a failure to do so could lead to authoritarianism . <P> ON THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX : It will remain a formidable factor in our economic and social life in the calculable future . It will continue to suggest to many foreign citizens , as it sometimes does even to our own , that our national prosperity is based on huge military spending , when , in fact , we could be much more prosperous without it .
