Priestess or Witch ? <P> Sir / Your article on foods and fads , " The Perils of Eating , American Style " Dec. 18 , showed good coverage in most areas . I resent , however , your treatment of Adelle Davis as a kind of prepackaged witch or ridicule figure . <P> My family and I have been following most of her recommendations for a year , and find that many of our health problems have disappeared .

Our food is not really meant for human consumption - only for machines . <P> EDWARD LANGLEY New York City <P> <P> Sir / It is not necessarily the foods we eat and our lack of exercise that are causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in times that are too fast moving , with too many pressures placed upon us . No amount of vitamins or organic foods will alleviate the pressures of living in a nonstop society like 20th century America . <P> CHRISTINA A. NORDEN Woodbury . N.Y . <P> <P> Sir / As a former hospital dietitian and food-industry home economist , I want to congratulate you on your superb nutrition story . <P> I plan on keeping this article to support my views when confronted by some modern food faddist . <P> ( MRS . ) JOAN KEMPER GREISCH Evanston , Ill . <P> <P> Goodbye to LIFE <P> Sir / The demise of LIFE magazine Dec. 18 is a great loss for all Americans . Seeing it go hurts me . For the 15 years that I knew LIFE , I could see the world more clearly . LIFE was an American institution . It was there during times of war and depression , and it was there during times of national pride and reflection .
