 | Storm Clouds Over Social Security MORE THAN 8o PERCENT of American workers have - " less than full confidence " that they will receive all the benefits they 've earned from Social Security , and 42 percent have " hardly any confidence at all . " Those are the surprising conclusions of a nationwide Louis Harris poll , and the questions they raise are obvious . Is Social Security really in trouble today ? If it is , what can be done to keep it from insolvency ? How much will that cost , and who will pay the bill ? To Social Security Commissioner Stanford Ross , this public concern is unwarranted . " American workers will get the benefits to which they are entitled , " he says . " The Social Security system is in good financial shape for the next 50 years . " Others r6o disagree . Dartmouth economist Co lin D. Campbell warns that " the longterm problem is very serious . " Even the system 's own trustees concede that its financing may be precarious and that an economic downturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an attempt to find the truth I talked with officials at the mammoth Social Security Administration ( SSA ) headquarters complex near Baltimore , with members of Congress , and with actuaries and economists . I studied thousands of pages of studies , annual reports and Congressional hearings . My conclusions are worrisome . There is no major problem today . People who expect to retire over the next several years will receive their  | full share of benefits . But storm clouds hover over the system 's future . Unless economic conditions improve and Congress moves to enact overdue reforms , the Social Security system as it now exists could be in dire jeopardy as early as 1983 . For many years , the nation 's foremost retirement plan ? covering 90 percent of all workers ? was actuarially sound and reliable . Launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935 , Social Security was a " pay as you go " system in which employe and employer contributed a similar percentage of the worker 's earnings to supplement his or her retirement income from savings or a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $30 each on the first $3000 a year an employe earned-and inasmuch as there were scores of workers to support each beneficiary , ' the burden could be spread around . For nearly 45 years , however , Congresses and Presidents have actively competed to see who could champion more benefits and extend more coverage . They broadened benefits for dependents and survivors . They made it possible for millions who would otherwise have been on welfare rolls to enter the Social Security system . They added disability insurance , then liberalized the eligibility requirements . They extended coverage to farm and domestic workers , lowered the minimum age for receiving initial , benefits from 65 to 62 , added the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly . Gradually Social Security became a massive national pension plan with something for everyone . Little practical thought was given to where the money was coming from . In 1972 , for example , lawmakers approved a benefit hike of 20 percent without a corresponding tax increase . They further strained the trust funds ' reserves by mandating that retirees receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above three percent . They " double-indexed " the computation of initial benefits to both wage and price inflation ? every time an individual 's wages went up or prices rose , his benefits increased . Not surprisingly , costs soared out of sight ? from $35 million in 1940 CO $32 billion in 1970 . Today the annual price tag is $104 billion , and estimates are that it will rise to $184 billion by 1985 . Then during the mid-1970s , while costs were skyrocketing , two more developments began to threaten the system . First , recession and inflation combined to push the unemployment rate to a 35-year high . That cut into the revenues the SSA was expecting to receive through the payroll tax . Second , thanks to advances in medical science , Americans had begun living longer and were collecting more benefits from Social Security . In 196o there were almost 17 million of us over 65 ; by 1975 that number had risen to nearly 23 million . The ratio of active workers to beneficiaries had plummeted from 50-to-1 in 1945 to a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain control o spiraling Social Security costs , the Carter Administration has propose phased-in benefit cuts that coul save roughly $4 billion per year b 1984 . Most of the suggestions mak good sense . The lump-sum burl benefit of $255 , for example , whi costs $200 million per year , is dole out to all survivors of Social Securityinsured workers and retirees , whether they need it or not . That , the Administration said , was overly generous . So , too , was the $i.8-billion program providing educational benefits for the children of retired disabled or deceased workers . " These benefits have become unnecessary as federal student-aid programs have expanded over the pas ten years , " explained Commissioner Ross . Then there was the saving of about $700 million per year which could be realized by putting a reasonable cap on skyrocketing disability payments . The Carter proposals ran into heavy opposition on Capitol Hill and their ultimate fate was very much in doubt as this article went to press . Despite years of warning , Congress seems slow to recognize that Social Security needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's what Congress must do : ? Resist the temptation to roll back payroll taxes and legislate a quick fix . " Already pressure is building up on Capitol Hill to roll back the Actuaries ' tables showed that , by the end of 1978 , Social Security trust fund assets would dwindle to $31.7 billion , enough to pay scarcely more than several months ' obligations in the following year . Lawmakers realized that they had to do something to save the system from imminent collapse . In December 1977 they passed ? and spread out over the next ten years ? a $227-billion tax increase for Social Security . The new law took effect on January I , 1979 , and provoked immediate cries of pain . The tax rates for employes and employers each rose from 6.05 to 6.13 percent of payroll , and the maximum-earnings base climbed from $17,700 in 1978 to $22,900 this year . In 1981 the tax rate rises to 6.65 t percent , and it will apply to the first $29,700 a person earns . By 1990 the rate will be 7.65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated to be $52,800 . Each worker in this pay bracket and his employer together could then be paying an annual Social Security tax of $8078 ! And still that wo n't be enough to put the system in the black and keep ' it there unless levies are hiked or benefits are slashed . Indeed , under the most likely scenario that the SSA 's actuaries can project , the combined retirement and disability funds will rack up a staggering $800-billion deficit over the next 75 years . Again , according to their most likely forecast , the retirement fund will run dry by the year 2028 , while Medicare 's hospital trust fund will be broke by 1992.  | @# 162 1979 . STORM CLOUDS OVER SOCIAL SECURITY  | payroll-tax increases that are scheduled to go into effect in January 1981 . Such a move would alleviate the pain most of us will feel when we look at our first paychecks in 1981 . Yet without the additional funds this tax hike will provide , Social Security will almost certainly slide into bankruptcy . To supplement the payroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( VAT ) , which would be nothing more than a hidden national sales tax . It would be regressive ? hitting the poor harder than anyone else ? and highly inflationary . Others favor dipping into general revenues . This would fog over the link between the payroll tax and Social Security benefits and tempt Congress to turn Social Security into still another welfare program . Besides , as Senate Finance Committee Chairman Russell Long ( D. , La. ) explains , " There are n't any extra general funds , just a generalfund deficit . " ? Require universal coverage . Members of Congress and their staffs are excluded from the Social Security tax now applied to io8 million Americans each year . So are nearly six million other federal , state and local employes , who have adopted more generous pension plans . Understandably , they reject all attempts to bring them into Social Security , and they 've been successful thus far . Yet such a move , if enacted gradually'and fairly , would make the system more just . If put into effect by 1982 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the next five years . ? Reduce the rate of growth of benefits . Until the 1977 law went into effect , benefits were determined by " double-indexing to both wages and prices , " causing hikes to far outstrip corresponding increases either in wages or in the consumer price index . Determining benefit levels by wage indexing alone has helped keep increases down , but further curbs are necessary . If initial benefit levels were indexed to prices instead of wages , substantial savings could result . ? Tighten eligibility standards . Since Social Security began , average life expectancy has risen significantly for both men and women . Yet 65 remains the age at which retirees can collect full benefits . It should be hiked ? gradually ? to 68 . This would increase the system 's revenues while reducing the level of benefits it pays . New rules should be adopted to prevent federal workers from seeking early retirement , working just long enough in the private sector to qualify for Social Security and then collecting both their civilservice and Social Security checks . Today these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private-sector workers pay and receive about two-thirds of the benefits . ? Crack down on waste , fraud and mismanagement . Some of the SSAs financial problems stem from slack bookkeeping procedures . Others result from a tolerance of waste . Until  | 1964 , for example , Social Security officials reviewed Too percent of disability claims . In 1965 they trimmed that to 70 percent ; in 1971 they cut it back to five percent . Even within that five-percent spot check , an SSA spokesman says , people are found who should n't be drawing disability . Then there 's the matter of overpayments . Between January and July 1978 , SSA sent 967,000 individuals some $536 million more than they should have received in retirement , survivors and disability insurance benefits . ( According to the General Accounting Office , the agency managed to recover only $207 million . In an agency that processes 35 million checks per month , some waste is inevitable . What is not acceptable is the lack of concerted effort to root out the waste . Resisting the easy fix , requiring universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightening eligibility standards and cracking down on waste will be painful steps to take . But they are necessary if Social Security is to return to a healthy state . @#
