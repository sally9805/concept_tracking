txt Astronomers from the University of California at Berkeley , the California Institute of Technology and the Carnegie Institution of Washington participated in the findings . The existence of two " new " galaxies enlarges the membership of what astronomers call the " local group " or " local cluster . " Galaxies , which are enormous revolving " islands " in the universe with as many as a million million stars in them along with vast amounts of dust and gases , tend to : cluster together throughout the observable universe . Some clusters are quite large and may contain as many as 800 galaxies . However , the local group , which houses the earth , is quite small . It includes , the Milky Way ( in which the sun is a minor star ) , the Andromeda galaxy , three small satellite galaxies ? and , with this recent discovery , two more large gal // By SANDRA BLAKESLEE to The Ncw York Mut , BERKELEY , Calif. , Jan. 10 ? Two massive galaxies " next door " to the earth 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California astronomers . The galaxies have been over- r looked up to now , the astronomers say , because they were obscured by a thick curtain of interstellar dust in the Milky Way . The discovery is being reported in tomorrow 's issue of California Astronomers Detect 2 Big Galaxies Near Milky Way // axies . These two are the farthest away of the group . Astronomers can see tens of billions of galaxies in outer space , but nearly all are very far away . Galaxies are discovered frequently , but the newly discovered ones are unusual because they are very close by ? only 3 million light years distant . A light year is the distance traveled by light in one year ? about 5,880,000,000,000 miles . The newly found galaxies are twice as far from earth as the Andromeda galaxy , which until now has been the Milky Way 's largest neighbor . But one of the new galaxies is just as bright as the Andromeda , the astronomers reported . Since it is farther away , they believe it may be larger than both the Milky Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the local group , measuring an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 light years in diameter . Italian Sighted ' Objects ' ' The discovery of the galaxies began several years ago when a young Italian astronomer , Paolo Maffei , reported finding two strange " objects " on an infrared photograph he made of a region in the northern sky between the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia . The region was loaded with interstellar dust  --  tiny grains of carbon and sand that are concentrated in many areas of the Milky Way  --  and is known as one of the " dirtiest " places in the sky . Dr. Maffei 's discovery was noted in 1968 in a West Coast astronomy journal , where it was picked up by a graduate student , Robert Landau , studying astronomy at Berkeley . Mr. Landau was impressed by the fact that the objects could be seen in such a beclouded , dusty region of the sky . If the objects were actually shining through the dust , he reasoned , they might be quite large . Mr. Landau proceeded to arouse the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , the largest telescopes in the world ( at Mount Palomar and Lick observatories , both in ' California ) along with the most advanced astronomical tools and research techniques available were mustered to decipher , the puzzle . New photographs showed that both " objects " were fuzzy and irregularly shaped . But upon careful examination they showed unmistakable traces of the characteristics of large galaxies . Calling it " strong circumstantial evidence , " the astronomers have concluded that the brighter of the two galaxies is a large elliptical galaxy . The second is smaller and appears to be a spiral galaxy . Both elliptical galaxies and spiral galaxies can be round or egg-shaped , but spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way , also have thin , winding , spiral arms . Maffei 1 and 2 The current report by investigators ' concerns just the brighter of the two new galaxies , which is being called Maffei 1 . A report on Maffei 2 , they say , will be published soon . The names Maffei 1 and 2 are what the galaxies have come to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of astronomy at Berkeley and senior author of the report . The names will probably be permanent , Dr. Spinrad said in an interview today . He also said that a letter had been sent to Dr. Maffei telling him what the Americans think he found . The evidence that the objects are galaxies is quite good , Dr. Spinrad said , First , in the photographs they look like galaxies . Moreover , the light from Maffei 1 is reddened by the effect of dust in the Milky Way ? an indicator that the light comes from a source beyond the Milky Way . Also the spectral properties of Maffei 1 match the chemical abundances of many large galaxies . It is unfortunate that the galaxies are situated just where they happen to be , Dr. Spinrad said . behind all that interstellar dust . But , as the Milky Way rotates , the galaxies will eventually swing into full view of earthlings . But it will be 100 million years before that happens , Dr. Spinrad estimated .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
