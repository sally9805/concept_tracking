One hypothesis has it that today 's middle-and upper-middle-class youth are romantically willing themselves into an underclass , thus perhaps opening opportunities for the rising and ambitious children of blue-collar workers . Anyone who reads the latest report of Harvard College 's Office for Graduate and Career Plans must at least entertain the possibility . <P> In the Harvard College class of 1970 , says the report , 18% of the graduating seniors were undecided what to do after graduation , against 4-6% in 1964-67 . The proportion of students intending to go to graduate schools dropped from 74% in 1966 to 46% in 1970 . While the idea once seemed willfully eccentric , a number of Harvard graduates are going into manual trades or becoming clerks or driving cabs-doing anything to grasp that " real life " from which they feel culturally separated . Against the traditional American grain , at least some are choosing downward mobility .
