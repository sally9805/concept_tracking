If the Nixon Administration gets its way in Congress , banks and S and Ls could actually heighten their bidding for savings in the future-and broaden it into a battle to provide the most generous terms on mortgage loans , personal loans and checking accounts as well . That is the goal of a sweeping set of legislative proposals that the Treasury unfurled late last week . The Administration will ask Congress to : <P> &gt;Abolish , over 5 years , all ceilings on the interest rates that banks and S and Ls can pay to savers . The savings institutions could then pay , even on ordinary passbook accounts , any rate that they thought necessary to attract money . They can do this now only on $100,000 certificates of deposit , or $1,000 CDs running four years or longer . <P> &gt;Wipe out many of the distinctions between banks and S and Ls , permitting each to invade the other 's turf . S and Ls , which now concentrate on making mortgage loans , could offer checking accounts , credit cards and consumer loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S and Ls can do now , and would be encouraged to expand mortgage lending . Regulations on loan size and collateral that now restrict banks ' mortgage lending would be eased . <P> &gt;Encourage all lenders to make more money available to home buyers by granting a tax credit on income from mortgage loans . In return , though , S and Ls would have to give up the special tax break that they now get by setting up larger tax-free reserves than banks can to cover bad debts . <P> &gt;Permit banks and S and Ls to offer NOW accounts-checking accounts that pay interest-all over the country . At present , NOW accounts ( for negotiable order of withdrawal ) are available only from savings banks in Massachusetts and New Hampshire . <P> If these reforms are approved , the consequences would be profound . President Nixon has said that " the increased competition that would follow should reduce the cost of the entire package of financial services for the consumer . " Actually , interest rates are governed by a complex of factors : the strength of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lenders expect , and how rapidly the Federal Reserve expands the nation 's money supply . But rates would tend to be higher on savings because of the removal of ceilings , especially when money is tight . Rates also might be lower on loans to individuals because of the new rivalry between banks and S and Ls . Consumers would also gain one-stop shopping convenience . Instead of going to a bank for a checking account and auto loan , and to an S and L for a mortgage , the consumer could get all these services from the same institution . The proposals are also designed to ensure a steadier flow of loan funds to home buyers .
