The ringmaster rose early , put on a yellow turtleneck shirt and made his one-legged way to Comiskey Park , which weathers gracefully on the South Side of Chicago , like the ringmaster himself . It was clear and warm and sunlit , a morning for the gods , but Bill Veeck 's team , the White Sox , had not descended from Olympus . From Alan Bannister at shortstop to Richie Zisk in right field , the 1977 Sox are human , at best . <P> Attendance remains uncertain . Seventeen seasons without a pennant have eroded the old South Side enthusiasm . Compared to what baseball men hold in Los Angeles and New York , Veeck 's bank accounts are light . Destructive-possibly planted-rumors are abroad that he may not have the cash to finish this season . Bill Veeck , who is 63 , tugged at an ear , limped in behind his desk and , smiling a civil defiance , went to work . <P> Live Lobsters . He had been running ball clubs since the 1930s , building , inventing , promoting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moveable fence in Milwaukee , which helped home-team hitters , and he put fireworks in the Cleveland Scoreboard to salute home-team home runs . He sent a midget to bat in St. Louis , and offered live lobsters as gate prizes to his fans . Critics said he turned baseball into a circus . Replied Veeck : Was there anything wrong with the circus ? <P> At length bad health forced him out of the game and then , when he recovered , it took a decade for him to buy his way back . Establishing a foothold in Chicago last year , he worked 15-hour stints day after day . Still , the Sox finished last . They also drew indifferently , and baseball 's anticircus bloc began sounding elegies for Veeck . " I 'd never suggested , " Bill Veeck said , " that promotion by itself attracts fans . Winning draws fans . Winning plus promotion sets attendance records . Promoting with a last-place team , which is what we had to do last year , is only slightly more difficult than running a benefit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . " <P> Veeck climbed out from behind his desk to consider the park . Corridors were bright with posters schoolchildren had painted . The Scoreboard in center , which now includes not only rockets but tapes of triumphal music , was primed . <P> The infield glowed a natural green ( Veeck ripped out artificial grass last spring ) . The infield brusher , a hopelessly complex machine that parodies overmechanization , glowed in luminescent pastels . " The place looks good , " Veeck announced . " It 's easier to turn fans off than on . A clean park does n't bring in fans , but a dirty park keeps them away . " <P> Back in his office , he talked trade with two executives and checked out the new scorecard . On page 5 , Veeck informs White Sox fans , " If your beer is flat , call Millie Johnson , if the washrooms are n't up to par , call David Schaffer . If you 'd like a tryout , give C.V . Davis a call . We do n't have a complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Television journalists crowded into his office , mostly to ask about Phil Wrigley , who had died that morning . Veeck granted seven interviews on Wrigley , varying each a bit so that every reporter would have something of his own .
