THEN SILENCE COMES to the Schiller farm , it is not perfect , the pigs clank at their feeders through the night , and in the barn Barky is prone to overstate his role as watchman , now and then wolfing back the dark ? which of course upsets the terriers who sleep in the dining room beneath the pool table , so that Judy or Rose , but seldom all four , will yap in response ? still the quiet is full , and necessary , nursing all that lives in the lots , in the grove and in pens : in the house : upstairs : Jean Schiller is the last to speak at night . She is lying beside her husband , in their room facing the yard . The door is closed , an act of gentle division : this is for Vernon and me , alone , the only such place on the farm , in their lives . On this side of it the boys share a bed , John who is sixteen and teases his mother , and Paul , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother and father talking downstairs in the kitchen , putting aside the cookies and cups ringed with hot chocolate , which they all shared , but they do n't listen because they must resolve the loss Allison I their school ? suffered from Readlyn , and by the time they 're satisfied with the next football game , the parents climb the steep stairs , and walk through the boys ' room . He looks at them , asleep , and nods without moving his head ; she wants to pull covers tight that are n't loose , but touches her husband 's arm instead : they are grown now . They lie in bed , talking about tomorrow : " You gon na put those gates in before noon , Dad ? " " I 'm torn between that and digging potatoes . " They are each smiling into the darkness : who will ever know what they say , his voice low , moving across the floor , hers , this one of hers , frail and trusting as a child : good night . Vernon is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking the Holsteins that all came in from the lot of their own volition , sliding heavily off each other until the right stanchion is before them , around them , closed : carefully eating the half pail of ground feed John ( his turn for cow chores 1 dumps under each oversize head . Behind them the father touches his body on theirs , stepping between two cows , draping his right arm over a hip , bending low , washing the udder quickly with a cloth , all at once , and with no less grace he squats , repeating a comic cone-dip four times , once for each teat , so a machine can suck out her milk . Twice each hour country music on WMT ( Cedar Rapids ) is interrupted with weather and news , " Radio Hanoi said today ...

Milk is cooling , route man comes tomorrow ; Paul is done early and helps John scrape manure into the gutter . The Schiller men walk from the barn , across the yard where four egg customers have already pulled in , dealt with Jean , and left ; Barky charges between them into the porch , which is wrong , and that riots the terriers inside , and with nobody breaking stride , Barky 's ejected , the terriers tolerated then hushed , jackets hung and hands washed in the egg sink in the pantry , bacon turned hold : the family stands suspended in the same room , she over the toaster ; he , arms akimbo in the dining room doorway ; John , hands in hip pockets , leaning against the pantry doorway ; Paul , musing , poised on the long counter ; the line is secured again ; " You fellas might as well sit down , it 's all ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .

If John was outside , with his cherished 22 , and if the pigeon was on the roof , he 'd shoot t : pigeons traffic in hog lots from farm to farm , . racking probable death ? for all their intelli4enee , pigs have the most vulnerable bodies of my farm animal .

John concedes ; Paul purses his mouth , de-berates then declines . " Suppose we might as well get a load of shay-rigs , " Vernon says . He lights his pipe . Occaionally a menthol cigarette ; maybe four in a ! ay . They are all awake now , agreeing with breakast : eggs , Paul up , John over , Morn and Dadvarying , half a pound of bacon , not sliced thin , juice not from the farm ) , milk , toast , coffee , a plate of thick chocolate-chip cookies to dunk , they could n't get a day off right without those . jelly from the orchard , maybe home-canned fruit . " How about you , Mother , " Vernon says around the stem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things . " Saturday the boys are home ; Jean reshapes her time toward the house , though she prefers outdoor work . The shavings are made by a sulky factory a few miles away , one of four in the nation . A neighbor is vice-president ? concerned about pollution , he does n't want to burn them and since shavings make good bedding , the people help each other out a little . The carts are made individually for each racehorse. measured to fit . A fun thing to talk about ; each of them listens . adding what he 's learned about such an interesting industry ; it has the touch of worth to them , of sense . To say that chickens are degenerate neurotics is not unkind . On the contrary . They are active now , in their houses , piling up shrill obscenities for the first nonchicken they see , nervously choking down their scratchings , massing their sound like ten thousand slipping chains , with one tiny rusted link 's worth of slippage from each , some terrifying belt in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and they know it . Whoever enters is complicit in their nightmare existence , and they acknowledge his presence at once , suicidally , heads low and racing wildly ahead of the body , shrieking , flailing , jamming themselves into each other , under roosts and feeders and nests , six , a dozen , thirty , unable to move , delirious to die , please please . Even with the unimposing presence of Jean Schiller , who walks among them twice a day , taking their eggs , feeding them , unplugging the automatic water pans , not easily moved by their desperation : " Knock it off , girls . Okay , okay . Come on . . oh come on now . " On the tractor , in the field , running men 's hands over the land ; no one talks because the chopper is loud chewing off clover and weeds , wild oats , spitting it into the feeder wagon , which is last on this train . The boys sit absorbed in forward motion looking backward , beside Vernon , who is driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the silage accumulates . The logic of turning the cows into this field is false , for they would eat only clover , enough to kill them ( each of the Schillers points out to Big John 's critics that only donkeys do n't overeat I. A gate : in one precisely rehearsed gesture , John puts his rope in Paul 's hand as he flows off the tractor , walking forward ten seconds after Vernon has cut the chopper , and opens the imperfect gate in time for the train to drift through , shutting it with the same rhythm that . carries this farm : one ; two ; three ; four : all live things simply conform to it , Vernon , his family , cows , all of them , no wasted motion , no energy thoughtlessly spent all these bodies passing through , horn satisfactorily on an old and gentle beat . Until John is mounted on the fender again , Vernon 's expression is incomplete . Every day we feed our cows : they give us milk . Around them everywhere , Iowa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not golden cornfields that run waving to tan gravel roads . The new order HE SCIIILLEHS are average farmers ; they net 1 about $8,000 a year . But there is n't a farm like theirs within a day 's drive ; they are not in business . Around them everywhere the old order has soured in the mouths of other farmers . Some are custom farming now . They have sold all their animals , which would tie them to their place every day , cheating them of their freedom , and they have invested in new machines , confronting cornfields with huge distorted helicopters turned upside down , carpeting and stereo decks in the cab ( two-men-high off the ground 1 , and blades that pick , husk , shell , load your corn and scatter the cobs , ground up . all at once , for about $13,000 per unit . They show you their home place , a new 200-foot machine shed and three rows of accessories for their " combines " ; they have a service for sale . Some have sold their crop land to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their house , working the land they used to own , or , if the corporation is in the trend , they watch the conglomerated land of their section , four sections , idle , drawing from $30,000 to $100,000 a year out of government soil bank programs . Companies hny land at 81,000 an acre , advising their farmers to plant , yes , and also not to worry if the crops fail since it 's all a tax write-off anyway . Some have sold everything and moved to Waterloo to work at John Deere or Cedar Rapids at Quaker Oats . Some still live in their country homes and commute to jobs . Some wait it out , bitter , bankruptcy assured . The Schillers own 120 acres , part of which is permanent pasture with what Vernon calls a meandering creek running through it . With some regularity it goes from two feet of trench to 250 feet of water flashflooding.Last year , afte a fifteen-inch rain , the whole family went dowi to play in the water . Brought a couple of inne tubes along . Fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that would happen any way , in good enough time . It 's dried up now when the polliwogs and minnows died , the bird feasted . Vernon has built his Holstein dairy herd ti thirty , never milking more than fifteen at once perhaps because the barn has that many stan chions . He used to name all his cows ? when h , was first married , he named them after his oh girlfriends , a joke his boys savor more each year Because his facilities are n't new enough , his mill is graded B , not for human consumption . He cat tell you Jerseys , Guernseys , and Ayrshires ma , have a higher butter-fat test , meaning mon money per pound of milk sold , but each has dis advantages for him ? temperament , lower vol rime , fussy appetites .

T IIINGS DO GET IN THE WAY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the road with the whole Schiller family trying to get him back , he made it possible foi the cows to gorge themselves on corn , which car kill them , for sure screw up production ? founder is one potential danger , a bizarre con dition resulting from too much protein where cows ' and horses ' hooves begin to grow and don ' stop , curling over and starting upward . and things no one 's heard of : Vernon 's sows are n't settling . They can be bred all right , but they 're not sticking ; they have a hard time at farrowing because there are n't any pigs to get out . Some experts think the pigs are absorbed by the sow 's body ; some are crying virus . He considers himself lucky because his an having four to six in a litter ? though they nor many have eleven to fourteen .

Rudimentary : corn , beans , checking earl other in the market , finding a balance over du years , both checking milk checking pork . And for all their odious behavior , the chicken kick in ready cash , thanks to Jean who abide them , scrubs their eggs , sorts , counts , crates then and sells 200 dozen a week to farm families wit no chickens , to black customers who wo n't leay. their car for fear of the dogs , to restaurants oi the highway who call at four some mornings , But almost no meat for the house ? seems most chicken raisers are not chicken eaters . Jean does other things . She works 8,000 square feet of garden ? canning 300 quarts of vegetables , some fruit she buys ? plus 800 pounds of potatoes ( kept in the basement , cold stone walled , not comfortably lighted , with two freezers , one twenty-foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ) , and squash , onions hung like giant grapes in the garage , pumpkins , sunflowers for blue jays . The Schillers have had a good year if they 've paid all their bills and made an improvement on the farm . N ARY , THE TOY . TERRIER born crippled , is I licking Paul 's knee under the table ; Judy , the toy terrier born too big to sell , leaps easily into Jean 's lap : without losing a syllable from.her sentence , Jean dumps her dog off the other side with one neat slice of her right hand , kind of a home-movie circus act : the dogs are needlessly coveting pork roast , potatoes , gravy , bread , green beans with bacon , pickles , milk , coffee , pumpkin and custard pie , needless because they 'll eat their fill of the five-pound noon roast , like the other Schillers , and what 's left goes to Porky . Jean mixes the conversation , kneads it , a Little Imogene Coca in her facial style . " Gon na put those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Probably be a good time , " he nods , pipe again . He stands and walks between his boys and the stove , opens one of two dozen drawers in the counter that reaches halfway around the kitchen , finds an oversize syringe , starts back : behind John he stops , touching both his shoulders . " You have a lingering aroma , son . " The men chuckle . " Did n't wear your boots , hunh , Scout ? " Jean says . " Got enough iron in the bottle out there ? " Vernon looks at the needle . " Think so , Should we do it , fellas ? " He heads for the jackets and sweatshirts hanging in the pantry , about nine per Schiller . Jean marshals the dishes , cleans them , some , how finding room in her cupboards ; she 's done in time to wash the pig vaccination syringe and head for the barnyard with her men to put the gates in , hurrah .

History , here , yet to be made : a 1938 calendar Tandpa Schiller brought with him from his last isit to Europe , in Dutch with pictures , Reichiinister Dr. Goebbels smiling , touching a golden lad ; history , here : Grandpa 's passport , Jean did n't ? . ep much but she thought that was important , nce it was the boys ' ancestry ; the same man ho sawed out a farm among his Platte Deutsch : : ighbors ; who was too ill to fight in World War ? the one who had his garage wall by the road id his mailbox painted yellow because of it ; allow still shows through the white .

Big John 's around , stepping slowly with two feet of penis dangling beneath him , showing it off , flaring the end of it now and then , intimations of a storybook erection ; pigs about ready to sell grunt on each other in a smaller yard to the left , one female especially enamored with another , trying to boar her without a drill , all that body angled upward into the air and only her stubby hips move , a single deliberate pump , slow and dirty ; behind the house the rabbits have n't tired ; Barky licks himself on the front steps , protecting his people from all danger , also waiting for table scraps .

" Supper conversation is about the Amish , the Hook-and-Eye Dutch , who farm a colony they own twenty miles away ; about their sawmill , the man who breeds Belgian horses for all , the kerosene lamps in their general store ; Vernon gets teased about all the red tape he had to cut before they 'd sell him a high Amish hat ; how the parents of a marriageable daughter keep a lantern on the gate , how a boy is marked as married by his hearCI ; how outsiders try to rook them , but they 're not stupid ; do n't you have to admire their independence , Jean says in admiration ; " But they 're not above stealing Bibles-111 never get over that , " Jean laughs , retelling the story about a farm sale where her aunt saw this Amish woman . They diverge still in perfect rhythm , Paul and Vernon to milk , John other animals , Jean dishes . John returns : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravy . and he especially liked the tinfoil dish .

Let us play . There are four Schi I lens in the dining room now , and the room is closer , as though they were all talking over one table : John at the wall desk computing his garden project for 4-H ? he is president ; Paul typing it for him on the pool table , he is vice-president ; Vernon is shaking his head at Capper 's Weekly . not a steady rocker , he must just like the chair , and Jean : " How many tomatoes from the garden , Morn ? " " Gee , I do n't know ? want it in bushels or quarts ? " " Well , how much does a bushel of tomatoes weigh ? " John asks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little irked at his family 's lack of analysis .

" I thought you 'd never ask , " he laughs ; she does too , hell he means it , the boys do . " Say , " he says out of his book , - if Adam had been paid a salary of twenty-five thousand dollars a year to keep up the Garden , and if he had drawn it regularly , " turns out the Vanderbilt estate was worth more . " Did you know twelve things make a dozen ? " Jean asks . Oh geez Mom . Well , it says so . Right here . " Know what a hogshead is ? " " Sure , a barrel . " " No , two . " " Oh . " After a lot of this , having crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , after a while , still without a suitable equation , Jean looks up : " Would you believe John has lost interest ?

" Ca n't you boys find anything else to do ? " John 's left unmoved by the movie ; Paul 's asleep on the floor , conked out before the Mexican charge . Breakfast is light on Sundays , everyone watches out for himself because church is at nine , so Jean has to fix her hair , get a dress out . Same United Church of Christ church that 's been there for ninety years ; pastors come and go , the last one being a little unusual for the congregation , since the undertaker 's wife was living with the pastor and his wife ; same church where the furnace blew up one packed night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped up and ran out without her kids , and the pastor said this is the end , and Jean thought if everyone grabbed a piece , they could save the altar . which is new ? a church filled with new things .
