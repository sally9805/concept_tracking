As Communist forces rolled toward Saigon and tightened their noose around Phnom-Penh , foreign journalists in those two capitals were caught up in an increasingly complex and tragic story that became more and more difficult to report . <P> In South Viet Nam , the swift advance of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops made venturing outside Saigon a dangerous proposition .

" It 's getting easier to get a candid view from high-ranking military officers now , " said New York Times Correspondent Malcolm W. Browne . " But there is a fatalistic belief that nothing they say or do matters any more . " Still , added Associated Press Bureau Chief George Esper , " you have to be present in the field to know .

As the military situation darkens , newsmen in Saigon sense a rising hostility from the South Vietnamese . The normally bland army newspaper Tien Tuyen ( Frontline ) last week demanded that the Thieu regime " take strong , hard measures against foreign correspondents " for being " in major part " responsible for Communist gains . As Danang fell , a group of American journalists gave two South Vietnamese marines a lift to the airport . When the marines asked the journalists their nationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's good , " said one of the soldiers . " We 're ready to kill any Americans we see . "
