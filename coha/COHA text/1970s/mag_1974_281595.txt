Soviet artists have long chafed under ideological commands that they stick to the rigid canons of socialist realism , and have flirted with such decadent Western forms as abstract expressionism and even pop art . Works in these styles obviously can not be sold openly in Russia , but there is a well-established private market for them among discreet collectors , including many senior officials in the Foreign Ministry , scientific institutes and universities . Many of the painters would like to make that market public . Last week 20 Moscow artists tried to bring abstract art out of the ideological closet by mounting an open-air exhibit in Moscow 's Smenovskoye suburb . The result was a violent confrontation between art and politics in which art literally took a beating . <P> Accompanied by 200 friends and sympathizers , the painters arrived about noon to set up their exhibit in a vacant lot surrounded by bleak new apartment towers . As they began putting canvases on improvised wooden stands , a man who called himself Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov ( the Russian equivalent of John Doe ) announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site into a " park of culture . " At a signal from Ivan , the burly " volunteers " began grabbing paintings , ripping canvas and splintering frames . At another signal , several handy bulldozers and dump trucks roared to the site and began churning the art works into the mud . <P> One truck backed into the crowd of about 500 onlookers and dumped a load of mud , half burying a six-year-old child who was pulled out scared but unhurt . A bulldozer started the crowd scattering by rolling a massive pile of steel sewer pipes at it . While water wagons high-arched jets of cold water at the crowd , other trucks careened along sidewalks and up grass embankments in pursuit of fleeing people . <P> Roughnecks . The " volunteers " also menaced foreign correspondents and diplomats who had turned out for the show . Christopher Wren of the New York Times had his camera shoved into his face , painfully chipping a tooth ; then two roughnecks held his arms while an other punched him in the stomach . Other reporters , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baltimore Sun , got similar treatment when they came to Wren 's aid . While all this was going on , uniformed militiamen and KGB ( secret police ) agents stood by or took pictures . When the hour-long fracas was over , some " volunteers " were observed changing into militia uniforms at a nearby police station . <P> " A mini-Czechoslovakia , " said one disconsolate painter as he walked away with a ripped canvas . " Now you know what they mean by socialist realism in art , " said another . Five painters were arrested and charged with " petty hooliganism " for trying to resist the bulldozers . By week 's end all had been released . <P> But effects of the incident continued to be felt . The police action had converted a minor act of dissent into an embarrassing political incident that was headlined next day in newspapers across the world . Soviet authorities indeed seemed to react to the unfavorable publicity . Though there had been no official word from the government , at week 's end one of the artists told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit at a different site this week .
