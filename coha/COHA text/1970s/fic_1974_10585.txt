, Canby to the right . About a third of the way back rode the two swing men . Two-thirds of the way back rode the two flank men , whose special job it was to see that the main body of cattle did not bunch up and become overheated , for cattle moving close-bunched generated a tremendous heat which could actually melt off fat . And in the rear , where the dust was thickest and the cattle most difficult to handle , for stragglers must be made to close up , rode the two drags . To the left , in the humblest position of all , rode Bufe Coker , so stiff he could hardly stay in his saddle , his bandanna pulled over his face to repel the incredibledust . To the right , escaping some of the dust , rode Lasater . Far to one side and slightly ahead of even Mr. Poteet , rode Nacho Gomez in his cook wagon , and well behind him , in a spot where the dust from the herd could not annoy his horses , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established formation the men and animalswould move for four months . They could average fifteen miles a day if conditions were normal , and that took into account a two-hour break in the hot middle of the day . On this first break , when the cattle were grazing quietly and Nacho was makingcoffee , Mr. Poteet spoke to the men as a group . The points and the drags will remain the same throughout the run . The four men at swing and flank will rotate mornin ' and afternoon , clockwise . There will be no gamblin ' , absolutely none , for it breeds discontentand I intend this to be a peaceable trail . There will be no drinkin ' , and if I catch anyone with a bottle anywhere along the trail , he gets paid off that instant , less the cost of one horse , which he can take with him in addition to his own . There are some trail bosses who even forbid swearin' ' , but I do n't see how we can handle twenty-eight hundred bastardslike these III without it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , easy to understand , easy to keep . Oh , two more things . Keep your guns in your belt . I want no gunfire , not even in stampedes . For heading off steers , wavin ' a hat is much better . If the time comes we need guns , you 'll know it . And do n't abuse the cook . He 's got somethin ' you ai n't seen yet . Nacho , lay off them beans and show usyour dragoon . ' Leaving his Dutch ovens , the Mexican went to his wagon , rummaged among his blankets and came back with a fearsome weapon . Basically it was Samuel Colt 's 1848 Third Dragoon , .44-caliber , rounded-triggerguard , seven-and-a-half-inch barrel , six-cylinder revolver , heavy andhandsomely tooled . Nacho had picked it up in Mexico , where it had been lost by some army officer serving with a force left behind by victorious General Taylor , but what made it especially lethal was that it had been fitted with a special shoulder stock , which converted it from a pistol into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side like a handgunbut still controlled like a rifle . And I 've seen him use it , ' Poteet said . Three things no sensible manp453fools with . A rattlesnake , a skunk , and most of all , a cook . " Or women , ' Ragland added in a whisper . Nacho smiled as he replaced the slaughtergun , but halted in mid-action when Poteet called , Wait a minute , Nacho ! Let me see that dragoon . ' When the Mexican handed it to him , Poteet deftly opened a secret lock at the base of the stock , tilted it until a few drops ran out , which he tasted as they fell onto his fingers . Then he replacedthe fitting and handed the gun back to Nacho . On the ride north with Mr. Skimmerhorn , ' Poteet explained , Nacho kept that filled with whiskey . ' The hands cheered the Mexican , and he responded by pointing to the coffee , which was now ready . It had been made according to the standard Texas recipe : Take two pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boil for two hours , then test by tossing in a clean horseshoe . If the shoe sinks , it ai n't quite done . ' The meeting ended when Nacho produced a Dutch oven filled with unexpected biscuits . The cattle were now starting to lie down , which meant they had grazed enough , so Mr. Poteet prepared to hit the trail , but before he did he told the men , We have a lot of younger fellows with us this time , so maybe I better remind everybody what a cowboy is . Sometimes he has to fight Indians , and sometimes he requires fancy ridin ' and tricky rope work , which I 'm sure you can do . At other times , especially in Kansas , he has to protect his herd against outlaws . And when we come to towns , which we do n't on this trail , he 's supposed to drink his weight in likker and throw his money to the girls . All that 's to one side , necessary but not important . For me a cowboy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Those cows yonder are the reason you 're here . And gettin ' them up north in one piece is your only responsibility . Let 's move ' em out ! ' and the cowboys slowly and with skill got the longhorns onto their feet , back on the trail and properly spaced for the afternoon journey . That day they made less than nine miles . Not only had they got off to a late start , well after the sun was up , but also Mr. Poteet wanted to have conditions as near perfect as possible for the first night . If we can get them safely through these first days and nights , ' he told the hands , we 'll stand a good chance of keepin ' ' em from stampedin ' . ' Knowing that the cattle would be eager to turn back to their home pastures , a very strong instinct , he found a small creek and led them to the other side . There he sought out a meadow which had a well-defined mound between it and the creek , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first have to climb the little hill . He then had his men quietly circle the meadow , their horses keeping well out from the cattle , so that when a cow or a steer started to edge away from the central mass , some horsemanwould be there to nudge it gently back . Silence was essential during this first critical night . There must be nop454noise from the camp , not even the sudden dropping of a spoon onto a tin plate or a loud sneeze . The remuda must be kept well away , so that no clatter from the horses could alarm the jittery cattle . Poteet , looking at the sky , was thankful that there were no signs of thunder or lightning , and he trusted that this far south no Comanche would infiltrate to stampedethe herd intentionally , with the aim of stealing two or three hundred cattle in the melee . Poteet stayed up all that night . So did Nate Person . The rest wereassigned regular two-hour watches . Two men , riding in opposite directions , circled the herd , singing softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice , dark and silent shapes looming up from the night , nodding as they passed , keeping their horses at a steady walk . In a wellrunoutfit , it was said , a night rider would move off a hundred yards evento spit , while the lighting of a cigarette or a sudden cough was intolerable . Within one second after an unusual noise , an entire herd of longhorns could be on its feet , dashing in some arbitrary direction , trampling anything that got in its way . Unmindful of ravines or rivers , of horses ormen , they might rush insanely for three hundred yards , then mysteriouslysubside and sleep the rest of the night , or they might run for thirty miles , nearly killing themselves from sheer exhaustion . Little wonder that astampede was something to be avoided , for its consequences no mancould foresee , and for some , overtaken by a trampling herd or thrownby their horses down some gully , it was the end of the trail . The first night went peacefully , and Mr. Poteet slept in the wagon partof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the second night there was a scare when a poorwill swooped overthe restless herd , uttering its mournful cry . Several steers leaped to theirfeet and at some distance from any of the riders . Quick ! ' Poteet called in a low voice to Lasater , who was riding guard , and the lanky Texan spurred his horse toward the trouble , but he was not needed , because a rugged old steer with a horn spread of fifty inches , named Stonewall by Poteet , muscled his way into the midst of the troublemakersand his resolute presence seemed to settle them . A steer like that is worth three cowboys , ' Poteet said . Where 'd you get him ? ' the cowboy asked . I used him twice before , ' Poteet said . You can trust him . . . like the general . ' He knew his business , ' Lasater said , and the rest of the night went without incident . On the trail Stonewall pretty much took charge . He was a canny beast , experienced in trail routine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Poteet waved his hat , he automatically worked his way to thefront , ready to set the pace . By the fourth day the routine seemed well established . However , it was broken that morning when a young boy , who hadp455been following the cloud of dust thrown up by the cattle , galloped into camp , asking to see Mr. Poteet . Lasater led the boy to the trail boss and listened as the young rider said , Mr. Poteet , my mom says please to ride over and see her . ' And who is your mother ? ' Emma Lloyd . ' Tom Lloyd your father ? ' Yes , sir . ' How is he ? ' Dead . Did n't get back from the war . ' Poteet looked across the grasslands , and once more the terror of the southern war assailed him . But he also looked much further back , to the happier days of peace when he and Tom Lloyd were courting Emma Staller , half-heartedly , as cowboys do , and one day Tom had said , R. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poteet had said , You 're gettin ' a great girl . ' The Lloyds had settled down and homesteaded a section with good water . Then the war . How far is the ranch ? ' Poteet asked , but before the boy could reply , he added , What 's your name , son ? ' Jim . ' Take the herd on , Mr. Person , ' Poteet said , preparing to ride with the son of his old friend . As they came over the hill Poteet saw a sight only too familiar these days : a Texas ranch with good prospects but on the shabby side because it had no man to tend it . A decent effort had been made , that was obvious , but things were run down . Young Jim , for example . He was clean , but his clothes were ragged . His horse was cared for , but his saddle should have been oiled . And the house . How it needed a carpenter ! Seeing Emma Lloyd in these circumstances was painful , but he dusted off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma , ' he called easily . R. J. ! Well , bless me , you look just fine ! ' she said , wiping her hands on her apron . What can I do for you ? ' Poteet asked . Jim here told me Tom did n't get back . ' Him and many others , ' she said . I need you to buy my cattle , R. J. ' I 've pretty well got my string , Emma , ' he said . So Jim told me when he came back from Jacksborough . I sent him there to offer ours . ' I did n't see him . ' He got there too late , ' she said , and R. J. had to turn away and lookat the low hills to the south . He could visualize the boy riding hardthrough the night and getting there after he had left . In some families the rider always arrives too late , no matter how soon he starts . Emma , we have every head we need . '  |p456I  'm sure of that , R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' money in more'n a year . I just got to sell these cattle . ' How many children you got , Emma ? ' Three boys . Jim 's the oldest . ' I 'd like to see ' em . ' When the boys were assembled he lit into them . Why do n't you clean up this place ? You 're men now , those cattle over there should be in lots better shape . You , Jim , do you ever do the chores to help your Maw ? You 're men now , and you got ta begin to act like men . ' The boys listened in silence , realizing that Poteet was blustering only because he was under strain , and they were right , for in the end he said awkwardly , ' I ' 11 take your cattle , Emma . How many do you have ? ' Two hundred and ten . ' I 'll take them only on consignment . I 'll give you two dollars a head now , plus whatever I get for them at Fort Sumner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he handed her the four hundred and twenty dollars  --  his own not Skimmerhorn 's  --  she asked in a soft voice , Would you consider takin ' Jim with you ? ' He 's only a boy . ' You just said he was a man . ' How old are you , Jim ? ' Seventeen , ' the boy said with marked determination . Jesus ! Poteet thought . Seventeen years ago Tom had n't even met Emma . No more had I. The boy ca n't be much over fourteen . He must get away , ' Emma Lloyd said insistently . Make a life for himself . ' Can you rope ? ' Poteet asked . In answer the boy jumped on his horse and sped toward a steer with mammoth horns . Deftly he threw his lariat so that the long axis of the opening fell beautifully over the horns . But having done this , he found he was not yet strong enough to drag in the steer , so that R. J. had to swing into action and rope one of the steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Poteet said . You can come along , but at the end of the trail you get no wages . ' Jim 's face betrayed his disappointment , until Poteet added , Because I 'm payin ' them to your maw , now . ' In this way Jim Lloyd joined the trek north . His arrival caused some consternation , since three of the cowboys  --  Gompert , Calendar and Savage  --  did not want to work in an outfit that contained thirteen men . It 's unlucky , ' Gompert mumbled , and others were beginning to agree , until Mr. Poteet pointed out that since Mr. Skimmerhorn was not a real member of the outfit , but only the purchaser , the number was not thirteenbut twelve , and this satisfied everyone . But that night on their rounds Gompert said to Savage , You know , I think he tricked us . ' How ? '  |p457He  said that Skimmerhorn was n't one of us , makin ' twelve . But you watch , if someone else wants to join us , he 'll count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen . It 's fourteen . " He 's clever . ' That 's why he 's boss , ' Savage said , and they rode on . Now came the days of respite , the days of grass and water before the waterless desert . The longhorns were settling down ; they were sufficiently far from home to have ceased wanting to return to former pastures and were content to move on to new . Stonewall stepped out each morning with the same sense of adventure that marked the men who were tending him , and at night the risk of stampede grew less and less . The herd was even beginning to gain weight , for the plains were filled with such luxuriantgrass that the animals became increasingly content with their march-rest-march routine . The thirteen men , too , had settled into a team . With the advent of Jim Lloyd , changes had to be made . He was assigned to the left drag , the worst job of all ; since prevailing winds were from the northwest , the man riding this position had dust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and needed the job . Coker moved over to the right drag , which was somewhat freer of dust , and he was glad of the promotion . He still had difficulty riding some of his horses , but on his pinto he had the makings of a real cowboy . Promotion within the swings and flanks did n't mean much , but at the point positions it did . Nate Person was moved up to scout , and now he ranged far ahead of the herd , seeking alternate routes to water ; some days he was scarcely seen and he missed quite a few meals . The control of'any string of cattle lay with the left point , for when cattle stampede , in the northern hemisphere at least , they almost invariably veer clockwise . Right point is a dangerous position because the man riding there may be run over , but the left point is determinative . The man in that position must ride fast enough to turn the lead cattle inward upon themselves ; this throws them into a milling confusion which gradually tires them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important job of left point was open , and to it Canby was appointed . In his laconic way he told Poteet , I can do it . ' Right point remained to be filled , and Poteet surprised everyone , including the man himself , by promoting Mike Lasater to it . He was a good horseman and he was brave , but he was also a convicted thief and no one had expected Poteet to select him for such important work . ' I ' 11 take care of it , ' Lasater said , and he did . He was conscientious and able to anticipate what cattle might do . After several days Skimmerhorn told Poteet , You made a fine choice . ' Now , in the evenings , began the after-supper yarning , and Jim Lloyd listened with amazement as the younger cowboys , little older than he ,  |p458told  of their exploits . It was not until several nights had passed that Jim began to suspect that perhaps some of the tales were more invention than truth . He had the bad luck to challenge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canby said , There was this man from Illinois and we told him , seventeen times we must have told him , " Do n't build your houseagainst them rocks , " but he did , in late November , and all during a veryhard winter he smiled at us , because we were out in the open and he wassnug against them rocks , and we broke our backs gatherin ' wood while he was protected against the wind . But come late April , like we expected , we hear this dandy from Illinois inside his house screamin ' for help , and we knowed what was up . ' Here Canby halted dramatically , and only Poteet and Person knew what was up , but the others were too trail-hardy to ask , so it fell to Jim Lloyd to say , ' What was up ? ' Heat from the sun had brought the rattlesnakes out from them rocks , and when this dandy wokened up he sees sixty rattlers in his room , withsome of them draped over his bed , and he like to died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's question : What did he dothen ? ' For one thing , he wet the bed . For another , he kept screamin ' , because there was n't no place he could put his foot down to escape . Of course , we knew the rattlers was torpid .. What 's that ? ' Jim asked . Half asleep . . just out from hibernation . So we went in and justswept ' em away like they was dust  --  shook the covers and flicked ' emoff on the floor . We got him out of there , but we would n't never go back , not even for his things . We had to send a boy in to fetch them . ' He paused and added , ' Sixty rattlers in one little room . That makes youthink . ' It was Lasater who told the story that Jim had to challenge . He said , I mind when O. D. Cleaver was comin ' home from buyin ' a milk cow , and if there 's one animal on this earth that hates the rattlesnake , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rattler loves milk better'n anything , and he 'll creep up on a cow and suck her dry . Moves from teat to teat , I 've seen ' em do it . ' I do n't think a cow would allow it , ' Jim suggested . With deep scorn Lasater stared at the boy , then continued : So asO . D. was leadin ' his milk cow home he spots this rattler alongside theroad , not harmin ' anybody and tendin ' its nineteen baby rattlers . Like pencils they were , not much . So as soon as the cow sees the mother rattler she lunges at her , and what do you suppose the mother rattler does ? She opens her mouth and makes a call , I guess . O. D. could n't hear the call , of course , but he supposes she made one , for every one of the nineteen baby rattlers scurries across the sand and jumps intop459mama 's mouth and back down into her belly , whereupon Mrs. Rattler glides away to safety just as pretty as you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more of nature 's inherent mysteries , but Jim Lloyd spoiled its effect by saying , I do n't believe rattlers can do that . The babies would suffocate . ' Lasater drew back his head as if he had been slapped across the face . Are you sayin ' it did n't happen ? ' he demanded . I was n't there , ' Jim backed up , but I doubt . . Lasater responded by drawing his Colt 's Navy and slamming it ontothe ground before him , its steel-blue barrel glistening in the firelight . Are you calling O. D. Cleaver a liar ? He seen it , goddamnit . He seen it , and you 're calling O. D. Cleaver a liar . ' No , I 'm not , ' Jim apologized . If he seen it . . . well .. That 's better , ' Lasater said , replacing his revolver . That night when Jim went to bed the others winked at one another and waited , and sure enough , moments later there came a scream of terror , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . My God , what is it ? ' Buck the wrangler cried . There 's a rattlesnake in my bed ! ' Oh , my God ! ' Buck cried in equal horror , even though he had been the one to plant it there . I kicked my shoes off and slipped my feet in . . . ' The memory was too painful , and Buck asked solicitously , Did it bite you ? ' I do n't think so , ' and as Jim started inspecting his ankles by the fire he slowly realized that the others were laughing at him , and instinctively he knew that his future in the outfit depended upon how he accepted this hazing . Keeping his hands about his left ankle and scrutinizing it with care , he said slowly , The rattler had a good chance at me , so he was either asleep or dead . I guess he must have been dead , because I do n't think Buck would be brave enough to pick up a live one and put him in my bed . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of dust and threw it across the fire at the wrangler . When he went back to bed the men laughed and told one another , He 'll be a pretty good kid , ' and they joshed Buck , claiming that the boy had known all along that the rattler was dead . But Jim , lying alone , wondered at the intricacy of the joke that had been played on him . It had started far back in the evening with the first mention of rattlesnakes , and he had swallowed every piece of bait they had thrown before him , so that when he finally felt the snake in his bed he had nearly fainted with fear . Along with the hazing , which continued for two weeks , the older men were generous in educating Jim regarding trail customs . Once when he returned , hot and dusty , he threw himself on the ground , his head back , his lungs gasping for clean air , but Nate Person caught him by the arm and warned , Do n't never do that , Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that way . Always look first . When a cowboy sits down , nine things can happen to him , and eight are bad . ' What you talkin ' about ? ' Jim asked in perplexity . He can sit on cactus , or embers from the fire , or somebody 's plate , or a Gila monster or a scorpion , or steer piss , or cow flop , or worst of all , a rattlesnake . If you 're lucky , one time in nine you get a little rest . So you look before you sit . ' The first time he came back to the fire after a twelve-to-two night guard , he went quietly to Canby 's sleeping bag and shook him , intending to say , Canby , your watch , ' but before he could utter a word Canby was bolt upright , jabbing a revolver in his face and cursing him . Do n't never touch a sleepin ' cowboy ! ' he growled , wakening the other sleepers , the very thing Jim had been trying to avoid . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddamn kid comes sneakin ' up on me and grabs me like he was a Indian . ' He muttered all the way to the herd , and Mr. Poteet warned Jim , When you approach the man who 's to take your place , let him hear you comin ' . Above all , let him hear you call his name . Start about here and say in a low voice , " Canby ! Canby ! It 's Jim . Your turn . " And he 'll know everything is all right . But for God 's sake , do n't touch him . You could have been killed . ' They also taught him how to sing during the night watches . It 's a fact , ' Person explained as he rode with Jim . Cattle , ' specially them longhorns , stay quieter if they hear a man 's voice , So we sing the night through . I heard a fella say , " Singin ' hangs a veil of confidence about the herd . " They stay content inside . ' The men sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest of the cattle songs , the one that struck closest to the heart of what a cowboy was : I ride an old paint , I lead an old dan . I 'm off to Montanny to throw the hoolihan . We feed ' em in the coulies and water in the draw . Their tails are all matted , their backs are all raw . Ride around , little dogies , ride around ' em slow . They 're fiery and snuffy and a-rarin ' to go . He never tired of the words or the monotonous tune . A thousand cowboyswould sing this ditty to their restless herds and quiet them . The verse Jim liked best was a dandy : Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son . One went to college , the other went wrong.  |p461His  wife was killed in a poolroom fight , But still he keeps singin ' both mornin ' and night . Jim , who knew little about girls , speculated on what had happened to the daughter , but it was the wife part that delighted him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pool cues and bashin ' in heads , and he was sorry the old girl was done in . He had seen pool tables and bowling alleys , too , at Fort Richardson , south of Jacksborough . The strangest song sung by any of the cowboys was that of Bufe Coker , for he favored what had served as a South Carolina anthem : Hurrah , hurrah ! For southern rights , hurrah ! Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag That bears the single star . When Jim rode with him he could hear the rebel singing this old battle song as though Coker were still marching in defense of a lost cause . He would begin to shout the words , and then Jim would quieten him . The opening verse of the song worried Jim : We are a band of brothers , Native to the soil , Fightin ' for the property We gained by honest toil . What property you talkin ' about ? ' Jim asked , and Coker replied , ' Niggers , what else ? ' Jim once asked Mr. Skimmerhorn about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skimmerhorn explained that no body of men had ever fought so valiantly for an idea so wrong . This judgment confused Jim even more and he raised the question with Mr. Poteet , who said , It 's a stupid song , but I marched to it . Who ever heard of a crusadin ' army fightin ' to protect mere property , and slave property at that ? ' As Jim came to know the cowboys better , he discovered how special these men were , these wanderers of the range . They were at ease only with other men ; women perplexed and sometimes terrified them . When they told stories of women they spoke with a fifteenth-century gentility and almost always it was the man who appeared foolish or at fault . They held women in a distant respect , and one night when Buck started to tell of a different kind of woman he had met in Kansas , Poteet stared at him reprovingly and indicated by a nod of his head toward Jim that a young boy was present , and Buck ended lamely , Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . The talk turned to horses , and Lasater told of the legendary horse thatp462roamed the Texas prairies  --  the fiery-eyed white mustang that no one had ever been able to rope . Several times he had appeared to parties that had lost their way and were perishing of thirst , and with mane flashing in the sunlight , led them to safety . He had done many remarkable things , including the time he had broken through three sets of latches which Mexicanshad constructed to imprison him , but his greatest feat was leading a party of women through a prairie fire . O. D. Cleaver saw that mustang as he broke through the fire , ' Lasater said . That pony had chose the only path to safety , and as he finished his job his mane was afire . ' A fire that big ... ' Jim Lloyd began . But once more Lasater had his revolver out and was demanding , Are you calling O. D. Cleaver a liar ? ' No , if he seen it .. You better be careful , because he did see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' On a starry night so beautiful and so mild with the coming of spring that the men lingered long at the fire , Savage , who rarely talked much , said , Just over the hill is Fort Phantom . . . that is , the ruins of it . ' That 's a crazy name for a fort , ' Canby said . That 's what it was , ' Savage insisted . My dad served there when the fort was bein ' built in 18 and 52 . He said it was the worst fort in the world  --  hot , dirty , bad food , no water , nothin ' to do . . . day after day , nothin ' at all . ' What 's the point of your story ? ' Lasater asked . Just this . In 18 and 54 the government finally listened to the complaintsand decided to shut the place down , temporary . On the last day as the men were movin ' out my dad heard the major say , " It would be a blessin ' if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll use it again . " So when the major and the men around him moved on , what do you think my dad and six of his friends did ? ' Burn the fort ? ' Jim asked . They spread oil and gunpowder and lots of wood shavings through all the buildings , forty-six of ' em , and burned the whole shebang .. . right to the ground . ' I do n't believe it , ' Buck said . Suddenly Ragland had his revolver out . Are you callin ' O. D. Cleaver a liar ? ' he demanded , mimicking Lasater 's voice so cleverly that even Lasater had to laugh . Let 's ride to the top of the hill and see for ourselves , ' Savage proposed , and with Mr. Poteet 's permission the younger cowboys took their horses , and by a roundabout way that would not disturb the dozing cattle , rode to the crest of a hill from which they could look across the starry wonder of the plains . And down below them stood the charred ruins of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing like ghosts guarding the stars.  |p463You  mean your old man burnt this whole place ! ' Jim asked in awe . Him and the others . ' They coulda been hung . ' Nobody never found out who done it . ' That musta been some fire , ' Gompert whispered , and the young cowboysrode back to camp . There the talk was again of rattlesnakes , with Lasater explaining that O. D. Cleaver had seen it with his own eyes : This rattler  --  a huge one , big around as your thigh  --  chases a prairie dog down a hole . Dog comes out the other end , and as soon as he 's safe he calls all the other dogs  --  and what do you suppose they do ? ' Run like hell , ' Ragland suggested . Lasater ignored the laughter and concluded : The other dogs hurried up , started to pile sand into the hole  --  both openings  --  then tamped it down with their feet , and smothered that rattler to death . ' I do n't think it would work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairiedogburrows and there 's usually more'n one or two .. Son , ' Lasater interrupted , why do you insist on callin ' O. D. Cleaver a liar ? ' I . . . well . . . I 've dug .. ' O. D. Cleaver seen it . He told me about it hisself . ' Skimmerhorn , amused by Cleaver 's credentials as an authority on wildlife , asked , Where's- Cleaver now ? ' He 's dead , ' Lasater said . Shot holdin ' up a bank . ' Now the days of caution began , for the time was approaching when the cattle would start their perilous journey across eighty miles of arid wasteland , with no water and little grass to sustain them . It was imperativethat during the next two weeks the cattle eat as much as possible and drink copiously so as to be strong when the test came . Therefore Mr. Poteet and Nate Person rode even farther ahead of the herd , seeking good waterholes where grass was plentiful . The generous land along the Brazos River was now behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rider would come over a ridge with good grass cover and from its crest see before him fifty miles of the brown barren lands that warned him of what lay ahead . The routine tightened and the men trained themselves to drink as little water as possible . They became extra polite in their dealings with each other , and all felt the tension of the ordeal to come . This feeling was not diminished when they passed Fort Chadbourne , once a notable installation with four hundred men and a German band , now a desolate waste of empty buildings . My dad served here too , ' Savage explained as they rode past the gaunt ruins . Had to be abandoned . . . never enough water . ' Here , at the ruins of Fort Chadbourne , Poteet and his men stood at the edge of vast territories still being explored by frontiersmen , partiallyp464protected by small forts . Save for the classic settlements focusing on Santa Fe , there were none of the churches , farms or homes which eastern states had enjoyed for the ninety-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land waited for adventurous men to join it to America . True , in the hazardous years of 1858-61 , the legendary Butterfield Stage had passed through here , taking the route to the Pecos River which Poteet proposed to follow , but the stage had been halted by war . The only sign that it had ever existed was the broken water tanks cached from point to point across the desert . For Poteet and his men there would be no water , and if their courage failed , they and their cattle would perish . This was the southern edge of the Llano Estacado , the Staked Plain . Its name had come from Spanish explorers who drove stakes as they crossed it , so that they could find their way back across its featureless domain . In 1542 it had broken Coronado 's heart , and now it baked in the sun , daring a new breed of adventurers to cross it . The Llano seemed to have been devised by nature as a fiendish test of man 's resolute will . Its difficulty increased by steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would be tempted to turn back , knowing that the next was to be even more difficult . Step one consisted of the sixty-three-mile stretch from Fort Chadbourneto the north branch of the Concho , a miserable stream which did , however , contain a little brackish water . Along this trail there were a few hidden sources of water to sustain the cattle if the scouts were sharp enough to find them . On an ordinary trail , this stretch would have been known as Hell 's Reach , ' but on this , it was the good part . Step two covered only thirty miles , from North Concho to Middle Concho , but it contained no water at all between the rivers , and here the handling of cattle would become difficult . Step three was a reach of eighty miles across barren alkali flats stretchingfrom the Middle Concho to Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos River . Here there was no water and little grass . Traveling at a normal rate , the herd would require nearly seven days to negotiate it , during which time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow be doubled or even tripled , the longhorns , drawing upon reserves of energy , might reach the Pecos alive . It was to this desperate gamble that the cowboysnow addressed themselves . Jim , ' Mr. Poteet said , it is n't proper to enter this part of the trail without a gun . See if Canby 'll lend you one of his . ' So Jim went to the point man and said , Mr. Poteet thinks you ought to lend me a gun . But I want to buy it . ' With what ? ' Money . When I get paid . ' You ai n't gettin ' paid . Everybody knows the old man gave your wages to your maw. '  |p465'I  'll get money somehow . ' Canby played with his reins , embarrassed by this whole affair . He loved his guns and felt that with eight he had barely enough for the work ahead . Still , it was n't proper for a boy to head into such country without a gun . It just was n't proper . I might let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun , ' Jim said . You 're right there , son . ' He slapped the reins against his horse 's neck , then pulled her back when she started to move . Tell you what , I do have an extra Army Colt 's and I could borry it to you . ' I do n't want to borrow it . I want to buy it . ' What in hell with ? ' Canby asked in exasperation . All right , damnit , I 'll sell you the Colt 's . Ten dollars and I 'll throw in the bullets . ' ' I 'll pay you some day , ' Jim said . That 's a promise . ' With everything tightened up , the outfit headed into the easy portion of the Llano . The days were hot and dusty , and the cattle grew restive because the grass was hard to find and the water scarce . Poteet and Person again ranged far ahead , finding some holes that had gone dry , others with enough dregs to keep the cattle going . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , to divert their attention from the scanty feed ; instead of ten to twelve miles a day , the pace was stepped up to fifteen or even eighteen , and in this way the first stretch ' of the desert was crossed . At the North Concho the animals drank the brackish water with enthusiasm , and Mr. Poteet kept them there for an extra day , watching as some of the cows stood belly-deep in the creek , as if to let the water seep into their parched hides . The men had trouble with this water . It gave half of them dysentery ; Gompert and Savage became so sick they could not ride their night rounds , so Poteet and Skimmerhorn took their places , riding double shifts . It was Nacho Gomez who saved the day ; he brewed up a nauseous concoction of cactus root , tobacco juice , vinegar and rum , guaranteed to tighten the loosest bowel , and after three doses Gompert and Savage were back at work . Anything 's better'n that , ' they warned the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were covered in two days and ended in disappointment , for the Middle Concho containedbarely enough water to replenish the cattle . Again Mr. Poteet laid over for an extra day , and this was wise , for some water did return to the creek bottom . He and Skimmerhorn rode well to the south to find the best possible drinking water , and returned to fetch the water barrel , which they filled . Each man looked after his own canteen , while Nacho collected as much as he could for coffee . During the next three days men would gnaw biscuits and drink coffee . . . till the water ran out . On the night of April 6 , 1868 , Mr. Poteet gathered his hands for their last hot meal . As they ate he told them , We 'll pull out at first light andp466move as fast as possible . You 'll have to watch ' em closely . They'lI want to come back here for water . I 've known longhorns double back fifty miles . ' Tomorrow night ? ' Canby asked . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . ' The men said nothing . Mr. Person will scout ahead and make sure we 're drivin ' for the pass through the mountains . He can borrow any man 's horse he needs , because I want him ridin ' back and forth , constantly . ' The black man nodded . The distance to water was eighty miles ; he would ride nearly two hundred , back and forth , assuring them of their way . Now get some sleep , ' Poteet concluded . At midnight Jim and Coker took over the watch , and as they circled the herd Jim could hear the Confederate singing : We are a band of brothers , Native to the soil , Fightin ' for the property We gained by honest toil . ' Once as they passed , Jim asked , Was the war tough ? ' Very . ' As bad as what we face tomorrow ? ' Different , ' Coker said , and he rode on singing . At first light the cattle were moved onto the trail . Now nature had used no subtlety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Concho and you had ground so hard you knew it had n't seen water for years . Two miles out the alkali began to show , a sickly white deposit over everything . It had a dead , barren taste , neither acid nor sweet , and enough of it in water could kill a cow . When the sun rose the men caught their first full impact of the Llano , for over the land before them they could see not one tree , nor any shrub of size , nor any trail marking , nor any sign of habitation . It was themost bleak and arid space they had ever surveyed , and it promised nothing . A man standing on flat ground could see to a horizon 3.2 miles distant . Astride a tall horse he could see an additional 1.2 miles . He was at the center of a circle with the radius of 4.4 miles , so that as the cowboysrode they could survey sixty square miles of the Llano , and on it they saw nothing but their cattle and their own shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began looking forwater , and this search they would continue for the next eighty miles , this endless , patient longing for water that did not exist . The toughest old hand , the rawest youth who was trying to swagger , would at some unexpectedmoment catch the eye of a frantic cow , and as he drove her back to the panting herd , he would feel his throat choking.  |p467Toward  noon Savage cried , He 's coming ! ' and far in the west the cowboyssaw a light rise of dust and then a horse and then a man upon it , his face white with alkali . They watched as he approached , his horse cantering gently over the flat sands . Dismounting at the cook wagon , Nate asked for coffee . Holding the cup with both hands and keeping it to his chin as he looked over the edge , he reported , We 're on the right headin ' so far . ' Any water ? ' None . ' He finished his coffee , changed horses and rode off long before the cattle were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the head of the column that required special attention , but now , since the cattle might try to double back , it was the rear . So Jim and Coker were strengthened by Mr. Poteet and Skimmerhorn , and for several hours the latter rode with Jim and talked of life in Colorado . It 's bound to be one of the greatest states , ' Skimmerhorn said . ' Better'n Texas ? ' Better scenery . Better chance for a young man . ' I 've heard good things about Wyoming . ' It 'll never be the state Colorado is . Too many Indians . ' How about Montana ? ' No people . ' Jim was impressed with this man . He was n't as iron-hard as Mr. Poteet nor was he as good a cowboy , but he was the owner of this outfit , and here he was riding drag . Jim had noticed that no job in the camp was too low for Mr. Skimmerhorn , and if the cook needed more wood , he was the first to volunteer . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one daughter and a son on the way . ' What if it 's a girl ? ' Nothing happened that long day , and for much of the time they rode in silence , each favorably impressed with the other . But on the night march trouble came , for the longhorns were bewildered by this change in tactic and by their lack of water . Again and again strays tried to turn back , so that Jim and Mr. Skimmerhorn were busy all night , riding until they exhausted their night horses and had to get others from the remuda . It was a bad night , and everyone was thirsty , but the men had hot coffee , whereas the cows had nothing . The second day was miserable , with the men seeing at first hand the effect of this perilous journey on the cattle . Several cows seemed to go half mad and men had to lash at them and beat them over the head , forcing them back onto the trail . In the late afternoon the cows began lowing , and soon the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rose and fell and entered the heart of every man who heard it . The sun was unbearable . Men would ride hard and break into a sweat ,  |p468but  the air was so dry that they never became wet . They gulped enormousquantities of coffee but did not have to urinate . Those with dysentery  --  halfthe crew  --  had racking bowel movements but passed no water . And alkali dust covered everything  --  the eyes of the men above their bandannas and the eyes of the cattle . Ordinary cows could not have survived this ordeal , but the thrifty longhorn , accustomed to thorns , struggled on doggedly , following Stonewall . In this time of trial each cowboy developed a positive love for that cantankerous old steer , his hipbones jutting out like those of a skeleton . It was as if he alone , among all the cattle , understood why this waterless trek was necessary , and he would do what he could to bring it to a rightfulconclusion . That night was most difficult , especially for the drags . Jim and Coker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real sleep or a hot meal and they were desperately tired , but the cattle , scenting no reliefahead , decided to return to the Concho , where they last had water . It seemed to Jim that he spent the entire night at a gallop , bringing steers and cows back into the fold , and often as he dashed into the moonlight , he would be aware of Mr. Skimmerhorn , riding beside him or ahead , working just as hard . At dawn , the herd having been held intact , Jim collapsed on the ground , and Skimmerhorn said , Let him sleep . ' He was there when Nate Person rode back , his dark sleepless eyes sunk deep in his head . He brought good news . The gap is dead ahead . Fourteen miles beyond it is the Pecos . ' Water ? ' Poteet asked . Lots , ' Person replied , but only at Horsehead is it sweet . Even a short distance north or south . . . almost stagnant . . . pure alkali . It 'll kill every cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The skulls are still in place . ' He referred to the line of horses ' skulls fixed on posts that marked the way to the crossing . ' I ' 11 be there to help . ' And back he rode to chart the course for them . The last day was almost unbearable . Thirty-two miles to cover , eighteento the pass through the mountains , fourteen from there to water , and this could be explained to men , but not to the cattle . One cow , driven mad by thirst , set off on a straight line to nowhere . Jim , knowing this particular : cow , tried to turn her back , but she brushed past him as if he did not exist . He called for help , and Mr. Poteet thought of enlisting the aid of Stonewall , but he was too far away , at the head of the column keeping things in order , so the cow was allowed to pursue her way . Jim watched her march into the bleakest part of the desert , stumble , rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fall for the last time as buzzards swooped down to claim her . It 's all right , ' Mr. Poteet said.  |p469I  raised her , ' Jim said , tears in his eyes . She dropped good calves . ' She had been the pride of the Lloyd herd , and he was powerless to save her . The dreadful routine was now broken . In the distant west appeared a column of dust , and as it drew closer it became a momentary vision of men on horses with a wagon , only to dissolve again into dust . What the hell can that be ? ' Lasater asked , and everyone kept his attention on the dust , thinking that it must be Nate Person , but it was not . It was indeed a company of men , seven or eight perhaps , leading a wagon drawn by mules . There 's no army unit around here , ' Savage said . Could it be the Pettis gang ? ' Skimmerhorn asked with real apprehension . No , they would n't range this far south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watched the approaching column with concern . Move that remuda in closer , ' he called to Canby , who rode out to warn Buck . Get the wagon , too . ' And Nacho headed his mules back toward the column . These precautions were unnecessary , for when the horsemen were close enough to be identified , they proved to be one of the strangest processions ever to cross the Llano . The man in the lead was a lean , sharp-eyed cattleman , thirty-two years old , named Charles Goodnight , the Christopher Columbus of the prairies . He had been everywhere , the first man to cross these plains with cattle , and now he was going home after having sold his herd at Fort Union . He knew Poteet . You can make it , ' he assured the cowboys . Your cattle are in bad shape , but they can handle the mountain and then they 'll have water . ' He impressed upon Poteet the necessity of keeping his water-starved cattle away from the alkali sections of the Pecos . Only at Horsehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and south and keep your critters away from the salts . ' What 's in the wagon ? ' Poteet asked . Oliver Loving , ' he said solemnly . My partner and friend . Killed by Comanche . ' He spoke briefly of Loving 's character and his knowledge of range life . He made me promise one thing . Did n't want his bones buried in a foreign land . ' Goodnight 's men had flattened kerosene tins t ' make a metal covering for the wooden coffin in which they were transporting the body . They had then placed it in a spacious wooden outer coffin and filled the space between with charcoal , so that the body would ride easily . We 'll bury him in Weatherford , Texas , the way he wanted , ' Goodnightsaid , and he reassembled his men to continue their long march across the desert . It 's easier , ' he said , when you do n't have cattle . '  |p470Before  he left , Mr. Skimmerhorn asked , You 'll be passing Tom Lloyd 's ranch , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is his boy . ' Mr. Goodnight looked at the boy and said , You must be about fourteen . Good age to be startin ' on the trail . ' What I had in mind , ' Skimmerhorn said , was that Mrs. Lloyd gave Mr. Poteet about two hundred longhorns .. Two hundred and eighteen , less one that died this morning , ' Jim said . And we 're taking them to Fort Sumner to sell . . . on consignment , as it were . ' No market at Fort Sumner . None at all . John Chisum sells ' cm all they need . ' Jim 's face showed his anguish at such news . His mother needed that money , but Mr. Skimmerhorn continued : I 've been watching these cattle . I 'd like to buy them all  --  right now . And give you the balance of the money for Mrs. Lloyd . ' You 've got yourself a bargain , sir . Did n't catch the name . ' Skimmerhorn . ' Mr. Goodnight hesitated . You 're not old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He stopped . At the Rattlesnake Buttes massacre ? No , sir . That was my father . ' I 'm sorry to hear it , sir . But if you want to send Mrs. Lloyd the money by me , I 'd be honored by such evidence of your trust . ' Skimmerhorn counted out the bills for the two hundred and seventeen longhorns , less the advance that Mr. Poteet had given , and Mr. Goodnighttucked it into his belt . Bidding the cowboys farewell , he headed his cortege eastward toward Fort Chadbourne . You trustin ' him with all that money for a widow ? ' Savage asked , and Mr. Poteet said , If you ca n't trust Charles Goodnight , there 's no man on earth you can . ' Then he interrupted himself to ask , What 's wrong with that boy ? ' and he sent Mr. Skimmerhorn to where Jim Lloyd was standing beside his horse , looking at the disappearing column , his shouldersheaving in silent grief . What 's the matter , son ? ' Skimmerhorn asked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother again . . . nor my brothers . ' Skimmerhorn said nothing , for he suspected that this would be so . They now led the cattle across the last bleak stretch of alkali flats and into the mountains , knowing that when the animals smelled the waterahead they would rush to it . But manipulating them over this final desert was bound to be difficult . The cattle were mad with thirst and could no longer be bullied . A steer cut off on his own , like the cow before him , and like her he died . The buzzards kept steady watch , floating in the cloudless sky , noting each faltering step . It was now that Stonewall proved himself invaluable ; he was a kind ofp471Old Testament prophet , leading his stricken cohorts to a better land , just beyond the mountains . Perhaps he , sooner than the others , smelled the distant water ; at any rate , he kept the animals moving and disciplined those near him if they attempted to break loose . At the top of the pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been scraped across the top with a ruler , the cattle sensed that water lay below them in the distant valley and they surged forward with new hope . But as they did so it was the cows , not the bulls or steers , who took charge . Some extra responsibility for keeping life alive animatedthem , and rudely they shoved the males aside , pushing and knockinguntil they came to the head of the column , where only the patience of Stonewall kept them in order . On and on they pressed , mad for water and the continuation of life . Their gaunt necks reached out and their dust-filled eyes peered through the haze as their legs pumped mechanically , driven by the last surges of energy within their shrunken frames . Keep up with ' em ! ' Poteet shouted to his men . Keep ' em from the alkali . ' The cowboys started at an easy canter , then found themselves pulled into a gallop by the running herd . Dust rose over the arid plains and buzzards flew higher to escape it . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward . They were far ahead of him and it was all he could do with his tired horse to keep up with them . Now Nate Person rode back from the river , shouting , Keep ' em to the south ! ' He and Poteet and Skimmerhorn moved to the right point to help Lasater force the stampede away from the bad water , and by skillful riding they turned the herd . I think we 've got ' em ! ' Poteet called , for the river was less than a mile away and they were headed in the right direction . But now a tragic thing happened . Stonewall , having safely brought the herd so far , smelled water and set out for the nearest source , which happened to lie north , just where the alkali was most concentrated . Head him off , ' Poteet yelled , but it was impossible to turn him . What was worse , the cows were following him and a great pressure developed from behind . Stop him ! ' Person shouted . Goddamnit , Lasater ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old steer , did not hesitate . Spurring his horse , he rode directly at Stonewall , intending to divert him , but the big steer simply ran down both man and horse , throwing both to the ground . Now only Poteet stood between the cattle and disaster . Without waiting , he rode hard at Stonewall , and again the big steer tried to run the man down , his old partner Poteet . When the trail boss saw what the steer intended he reined in his horse and waited till the big brute was upon him . Then , aiming his revolverp472carefully , he destroyed the wonderful animal . With a last look of astonishmentat Poteet , the steer stumbled forward and fell into the dust . Instantly Poteet spurred his horse away from the spot , and with help from Skimmerhorn , held the hesitant cattle and headed them for the good water . They surged into the stream past the skeleton horscheads and stood there for some minutes before drinking . Then , unlike the men who drank in foolish gulps , they took small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy stream echoed with their joy . Jim Lloyd and Coker found Lasater stretched out unconscious , but Mr. Skimmerhorn , who listened to his heart and felt for broken bones , told them , He 'll be all right . ' Now Ragland called , Poteet 's missing , ' and everyone tried to reconstruct where the boss had been . He was riding like hell when we turned the cows back , ' Skimmerhorn said , and they spread out . Canby found him back down the trail a bit , toward the bad water . He had dismounted and was standing beside Stonewall , and as the younger Texans rode by in their search , Canby motioned them away , and they left him there , each cowboy with his own memory of that splendid steer . The Pecos was a preposterous river . For the past five weeks these men had dreamed of the moment when they would lead their cattle down to it , and for the last three waterless days it had been an obsession . Now here it was , about eighteen feet across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a little deeper in others . There was n't much water , but it kept flowing . Two hundred cows would crowd into the good part and drink like siphons , and minutes later the water would stand at the same level . Jim Lloyd tried it , and it was brakish , tasting of alkali even at the good part . Farther up you could n't keep the water in your mouth , let alone swallow it . Hell , I could jump that , ' Ragland said , and he steped back , hunched up his shoulders and pumped his legs like pistons on one of the new steam engines . With a snort he sped across the even upland , tore down the steep bank and gave a mighty roar as he leaped into the hot air broodingover the river . He would have made it , too , except that he found no secure place from which to take off . He fell two feet short , landed with a resounding splash , fought to maintain a foothold and fell backward in the water . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap their legs and ask each other , Remember when Old Rags said he could jump the Pecos ? Hell , he missed by a mile ! ' Henceforth he would be Old Rags , the highestcompliment a cowboy could pay another . It would never be Old Gompert or Old Savage and certainly not Old Buck . That would be inconceivable.  |p473The  men led the cows across to the western bank , then camped for three days till everyone recovered , but as they were about to move out , the wrangler , who had his horses to the north , shouted , Calvary ! ' Like all Texans , he pronounced this word in its biblical form . Any soldier on horseback was calvary . It was a detachment from Fort Sumner , riding out to scout the MescaleroApaches , who were on a rampage through central New Mexico . We want you to drive up the east bank , ' a lieutenant shouted . Is there grass over there ? ' Poteet asked . Not good , but if you stay over here they 'll steal your horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much fighting ? ' Nope . Just raids . If you shoot , they shoot . ' When the cavalrymen finished their coffee they disappeared to the south , and Poteet laid plans to keep the remuda closer to camp , with extra men to help guard it . An Apache can steal your blanket while you 're sittin ' on it , ' he warned , but they 're not goin ' to get our horses . ' With loud huzzahs the men brought the Crown Vee cattle back to the east bank , no great feat , and started them north . It was a curious trail : the land bordering the river was loaded with cactus , barren of grass and blistering hot . In order for the cattle to feed , the cowboys led them about six miles away from the river , but for them to drink , they had to come back to one of the potable spots , and in this zigzag fashion they stumbled north . ' I 'll put this land up against the worst in Texas , ' Lasater said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasater , that you was mighty near hung ? ' ' Yep . ' How come ? ' Me and O. D. Cleaver was fixin ' to hold up a bank in a place called Falfurrias .. They ai n't no such place as Falfurrias , ' Ragland said . North of the border , ' Lasater replied . It was important to him that the men acknowledge the truth of his claim . You know Reynosa , where we used to pick up the Mexican herds ? You cross the river to Hidalgo , which is n't much , and come due north and you hit Falfurrias . ' Yeah , ' Savage agreed . About halfway to San Antonio . ' His veracity established , Lasater said , Me and O.D. was camped six miles south of Falfurrias , sort of scoutin ' out the place , and we figured the sheriff and most of the men would be out of town on Thursday afternoon  --  somethin ' doin ' to the north  --  and we rode into town easy-like , but they had n't gone . The sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and they did , and somebody yelled , " Let 's hang ' em , " and somebody else yelled , " We ca n't hang ' em . They ai n't done nothin ' , " and this danged old sheriff shouts , " We can hang ' em for what they was gonnap474do , " and danged if they did n't haul us out to the edge of town and start to string us up when a young feller who musta been either a lawyer or a preacher interrupts in a loud voice cryin ' , " This is unconstitutional and against the law of God , " and the sheriff says , " You know danged well these two was gon na rob the bank . You seen ' em scoutin ' the place the last three days , " and they tightened the rope , and the young feller draws his gun and says , " Then you got ta hang me too , because I 've scouted that danged old bank many a day . " So they let us go , and I got just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falfurrias , " because down there they hang you for what you 're thinkin ' . ' How come you took to robbin ' banks ? ' Ragland asked . Lasater stared at the fire and offered no explanation , so Ragland continued : You goin ' back to it when we 're done ? ' I sure ai n't plannin ' to , ' Lasater said , and Jim Lloyd , sitting near him as he said these words , saw the strange look on his face , as if the older cowboy knew that no man was complete master of his fate , and that sometimes a man found himself caught up in the robbing of a bank when that had not been his intention at all . It now became difficult to find potable water , for the Pecos became loaded with alkali , and the water holes , which were frequent in the area , could not be used , because they were passing through land claimed by John Chisum , greatest cattle baron in the west . He was so determined to hold on to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of his own cattle and directed his men to salt the others . Some years ago Chisum had accomplished in New Mexico what Seccombewas trying to do in Colorado : by purchasing six hundred strategicacres with water he had established his iron rule over another six million . He considered all this land his and was ready to shoot anyone who dared trespass upon it with intention of staying . His own land would support at best twenty cows ; he ran upward of forty thousand on land that rightfully belonged to the general public , but if one of that public tried to build a cabin anywhere on the vast reaches , or tried to water his cattle at a Chisum well , he faced the barrel of a gun . We 're now on John Chisum land , ' Poteet warned the men as they moved north . The range , farther than a man could see in ten days of travel , was Chisum 's because he said so . Scores of good men would die before this unique theory of land ownership could be successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this problem of no drinkable water in the Pecos and none in John Chisum 's wells , they were confronted with another trying situation . For some time the older hands had noticed that two or three of the cows were growing distressingly fat , and one morning they woke to find that one of them had thrown a calf . They looked at Jim . When Mr. Poteet heard of the matter he said , Well , Jim . The drag takes care of the calves . That 's the rule . '  |p475How  ? ' Jim asked . You kill ' em . ' I what ? ' Jim asked , his face turning white . Tell him , Nate , ' and Person took Jim and Coker aside and said , Every outfit that trails cows has this problem . Calves . They ca n't possibly keep up . You 'd lose cow and calf . ' He shook his head and told the drags , It 's your job to kill ' em . ' But how ? ' Jim pleaded . Some shoots ' cm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' But I . . . ' Before the boy could speak Person left , taking Coker with him . Jim went to where the cow was suckling her newborn , and one look at the white snout and the eager lips of the calf as it found the teat undid Jim completely for his task . He touched his revolver but could not take it from his holster . He looked about for a club and was gratified when he found none . Finally , in despair , he lifted the calf and took it from its protecting mother , who followed him almost to the camp . I ca n't kill a calf , Mr. Poteet . I raise ' em . ' Put the damned thing down , ' Poteet shouted , and get rid of it . ' He turned away in disgust , and Jim appealed to the others , but no one would help . He was ashamed of the tears that came into his eyes , but he would not put down the calf . Finally , off to the left he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Let me put the calf in your wagon . . . just for a while . I 'll think of somethin ' , ' so Nacho hid the calf , but when they stopped and the men were eating , the calf bawled , and Mr. Poteet started to say , What in hell . . . ' but he stopped . There were some things a trail boss was wise not to hear . So Jim fed the calf and tended it , and when another was born the job of destroying it was given to Coker , but he proved no more valiant than Jim . Hell , I ca n't use a LeMat that was carried by a Confederate colonelto kill no calf , ' he said , and his found a place with Nacho , too . But when a third was born and Jim could not kill it , Mr. Poteet had had enough of first-time drags . Out those calves go , and you two men finish them off , ' he snapped , but Jim found reprieve in an unlikely quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I theenk I got sometheeng. . . sometheeng g000d , ' and he asked permission to keep the calves till they got to Fort Sumner , and Poteet gave grudging consent . Three days shy of Fort Sumner the Apaches struck , but they did so with such cunning , crossing the Pecos after midnight and moving with the stealth of coyotes , that three of the horses were on the west bank of the river before anyone realized they had been stolen , and the cowboys would n't have known it even then except that a bay horse much loved by Gompert whinnied , and he leaped up from his sleeping bag with a wild shout , They 're stealin ' my horse . ' The cowboys could n't believe it . The Apaches had come right into thep476camp , had passed the remuda where the three guards waited , and had stalked through the space between the sleepers and the cook wagon , leading three good horses away with them . We did n't see nothin ' , ' the wrangler reported on behalf of the guards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard nothing . Gompert wanted to organize a posse to ride after the Apache and shoot it out , and Lasater and Coker were eager to go , but Mr. Skimmerhorn counseled prudence . Apaches have been stealing horses for centuries , ' he said . They could of killed us in our sleep , ' Lasater said . Why in hell did n't they steal the calves ? ' Poteet asked . During the next two days the cowboys were unusually sensitive to their surroundings , and twice the younger fellows thought they saw Apaches on the western hills , but nothing came of it . Jim Lloyd , inspectingthe landscape with extra care , made the acquaintance of a bird thathe would always remember as the symbol of the drive , a doughty , quick , amusing creature that stayed on the ground much of the time , tilting his head from side to side while his crest of brown and white feathers glistenedin the sun . It was the roadrunner , a member of the cuckoo family , with an extensivetail which balanced beautifully as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly , curious bird , and he made thecowboys laugh , for his crest rose and fell according to his interest in things at hand . Often he would halt , look up at Jim and cock his head , fluttering his tail to maintain balance . Jim was surprised to find that it was Lasater , the robber , who most appreciated the animals they encountered . Mom told us that God sent the roadrunner to show us the way through difficult places , ' he said , and this started a lugubrious fireside discussion of mothers and other noble women the cowboys had known . Tale after tale of frontier heroism unfolded , invariably with some gallant woman at the core of the action . They was this woman down along the Rio Grande , ' Canby said . Husband killed in the war with Mexico . Big ranch to care for , thousandsof cattle and no one around her but a bunch of greasy damned Mexicans ... ' Nacho Gomez was cleaning up after the night meal and listened with rapt attention . He liked stories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never too long or tedious for his listeners . The stars of spring rose high in the heavens and Jim thought how sad it was to see Orion go to bed in the west , taking the long sleep till next winter . That night as he and Ragland rode the two-to-four , listening for Apaches , they traveled at their regular , monotonous speed , but each time as they passed in the darkness they stopped their singing to exchangea few words , the subject continuing to be women.  |p477FIRST  PASS : Jim , you ever kissed a girl ? ' Nope . ' SECOND PASS : It can be rather satisfyin ' . ' THIRD PASS : But parts of it can be mystifyin ' , too . ' That was the lesson for the night , and Jim brooded upon it till his watch ended . Two nights later he and Ragland resumed their discussion , which became more specific . FIRST PASS : Jim , you ever been in a whorehouse ? ' Nope . ' SECOND PASS : Jim , you know what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We get to Las Vegas , you 're gon na find out . ' In this fragmentary but highly gratifying manner Jim Lloyd was introduced to the mysteries of life . God , sex , money , acquiring a ranch and , above all , how to handle women were explained to him by the night riders . Once as he passed Gompert on the ten-to-twelve that young cowboysort of summarized the whole subject . FIRST PASS : Jim , do n't you believe everthing Old Rags tells you . ' SECOND PASS : There 's one hell of a lot Mr. Smart-ass Ragland do n't know . ' THIRD PASS : Always remember , the finest woman you 'll ever meet was your maw . ' I know . ' FOURTH PASS : Of course , other girls can be pretty nice , too . ' I know . ' FIFTH PASS : Of course , Jim , I 'm speakin ' only of nice girls . ' So am I. ' There was a sense of relief when the column reached Fort Sumner , a dismal outpost on the Pecos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the commander heard that Poteet 's group had lost only three horses , he laughed . We keep a line of old crocks over there so the braves can practice stealing . Makes ' em think the old days are still here . ' He told Gompert , If you lost only one horse , it was cheap , ' but Gompert wanted to know if he could ride out with a scoutingparty , to see if he could recover his horse . Son , forget it ! You 'll have real problems on your hands if the Comanchedecide to move westward . ' Where are they now ? ' Poteet asked . Our scouts have them spotted way to the east . North of Texas in the Indian country . But they could be moving west . I 'd take my cattle over to the west bank . Forget the Apaches and keep an eye out pretty firmly to the east . ' Now Nacho Gomez sprang his surprise regarding the calves . Asking for a horse , he spoke with some of the soldiers , then rode directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a dozen Mexi/can farmers leading a horse laden with trading goods . Going to his wagon , he produced the three calves , and the Mexicans groaned with delight . A bull ! ' one cried , and Mr. Poteet watched as Nacho entered into frenetic bargaining . The Mexicans offered chickens , long strings of garlic , onions , peppers and bundles of herbs none of the cowboys could identify . Nacho acceptedeach with a delighted grin , turning to inform the cowboys , Now we feast ! ' In the end the Mexicans appointed three riders to follow the herd north , to collect any additional new calves , and the leader said to Mr. Poteet , Pray God there will be bulls ! For then we can start our own herd . ' On the first night out of Fort Sumner , Nacho prepared a chicken stew with potatoes and gravy , which Mr. Skimmerhorn pronounced one of the best he 'd ever eaten , but Canby , Gompert and Savage refused it . We do n't want no Mexican grub , ' they complained . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch oven , cut off six big steaks , two per man , put the oven in the fire , piled coals on the lids , and when the chewy meat was nearly black , served it to the grumblers . ' That 's decent food , ' Canby said as he chewed the tough meat . The same thing happened next night when Nacho served a kind of chili , hot and meaty and very tasty . Again Mr. Skimmerhorn complimentedthe Mexican , and again Canby and his colleagues complained that they did n't come on no cattle trail to eat Mexican grub , and where were the steaks ? Sad-eyed , Nacho again got down the oven and crisped up half a dozen steaks , and the cowboys were satisfied . Wanting to get back in their good graces , Nacho decided to give them an extra ration of biscuits . He was especially good with biscuits , for which he kept a large crock of sourdough fermenting in the back of his wagon . He had started this crock working back in Jacksborough : flour , water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash and some salt . When it was well fermented he threw away about two-thirds  --  ' To keep the crock happy '  --  and refilled it with flour and water . Sourdough would n't breed unless the temperature was just right , so on very cold nights Nacho took the crock to bed with him ; on unusuallyhot days he kept it in the wagon wrapped in a wet cloth . To make his biscuits he took from the crock a good helping of sourdough , mixed it with flour , water and salt , and pinched off nubbins , which he placed around the bottom of a Dutch oven , maybe forty biscuitsto one baking . Nacho 's biscuits were the best the men had ever eaten , and he told them his secret : More coals on top than on the bottom . ' He achieved this by placing his oven in dying embers and heaping upon the lid the liveliest coals he could find . In this way the biscuits came out brown and crisp on top , well done on the bottom and just about perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a meal , so that each rider could have six or seven , but this night he outdid himself . Knowing that the treat he had for them would be appreciated , he baked up three ovenfuls of biscuits , many more than a hundred , and told the men , For that young bull Mr. Poteet traded , look what we got ! ' And he opened four jars of the finest sagebrush honey , dark and aromaticand tasty . The men ate ravenously , and Canby said , For a lousy Mexican , you are one great cook . ' The chili and the chicken stew were forgiven . Men broke open the crusty biscuits , drenched the feather-light insides with honey and ate them like Christmas candy . Two days later , as they were crossing the Pecos prior to the march into Colorado , Poteet allowed his herd to get separated . The first half was safely across the river and had started toward the low mountains that lay ahead , but the trailing half was having trouble negotiating the steep bank into the stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east chasing strays , looked across the Pecos and saw some twenty Comanche sweep out from behind a mesa , where they had been hiding , and launch an attack on the forward half of the herd . For just a moment Coker sat transfixed , staring at the superb horsemen , checking to see how many had guns , how many lances , and he was stunned by the magnificence of these half-naked warriors . Quickly he recovered his senses and fired a warning shot from his LeMat , but the Indians ignored him , concentrating their attention on the forward half of the column . Now Coker spurred his horse , galloping back to the rear of the herd , but what he saw there dismayed him . Jim Lloyd and Ragland had been helping at drag , and when they saw a skirmish developing on the north side of the Pecos , they drove their horses into the river , with Ragland yelling , Here we come ! ' Mr. Poteet , anticipating such foolhardy response , left the fight for a moment and bellowed , Get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midstream to find Coker cursing at them from the shore . Our fight will be here , ' he yelled . And as they scrambled back to dry land he shouted , Bring the cattle in close . If they stampede , we 're finished . ' On the north bank a savage struggle ensued , with Poteet in charge and Canby firing like a machine as the Indians surged past in one attack after another . Mr. Skimmerhorn and Nate Person stayed up at point , drawing much of the Indian fire and alternately riding back to keep the startled herd from milling . Sweet Jesus ! ' Nate yelled . I sure wish we had Stonewall now . ' Coker , watching the fight , shouted to Lloyd , That nigger can handle hisself , ' but Jim was watching Mr. Skimmerhorn , noting the cool yet desperateway in which the northerner held off the Indians when they borep480down upon him . Everything he 's got is at stake , ' Jim muttered as he watched Skimmerhorn reloading . It would be a long time before Jim could forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously right at the central core of white men , trying apparently to chop down Mr. Poteet , whom they spotted as the leader . He stood coolly firing his revolver as they approached , then took up his rifle , firing point-blank at the Indians and diverting their attack . In a violent turn to the north , the Indians bore down on Canby , who kept firing with both hands . One Comanche with a vicious chop of his hatchet caught Canby on the right shoulder , tearing away cloth and skin down to the elbow . For one desolate moment Canby stood erect with a revolver in his right hand ; then cloth and flesh and blood enveloped the hand and the revolver vanished . The Texan stared at his nearly severed arm and calmly said something to Savage , who was fighting beside him . ' II A band of Comanche now forded the river and spurred their horses to attack the rear guard . Do n't fire too soon , ' Coker shouted , and the three guardians waited until the Indians were well upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim heard the Confederate yelling , Fire , Lloyd , fire ! ' And in a kind of daze the boy began using the pistol Canby had given him , thinking all the while of Canby 's arm . Twice more the Comanche bore down on Jim and might have killed him except that before the third charge , Bufe Coker rushed over , firing rapidly and killingtwo Indians . The rest fled . The herd had been held together . No horses , no cattle had been lost . One Indian was dead on the north bank , three on the south , and suddenlyJim Lloyd realized that he had been at the center of the fight . Old Jim just stood there and fired like he was a veteran , ' the cowboys said admiringly , and Jim said to Nate Person , Boy , was I glad to see you comin ' back across that river , ' and he pretended not to hear when Gomperttold Mr. Skimmerhorn , Did you see Old Jim blazin ' away at that Comanche chief ? Hell , he couldn'ta been three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ' The words blazed through . I killed him ? ' Jim asked . I sure as hell did n't , ' Coker said . I was busy with them braves . ' The young cowboys were turning the corpse over with their boots and Jim could see once more the chief 's face during that last charge : terrifying , very close . I think Nate Person shot him , ' Jim said . But he knew that he himself had fired the shot  --  had killed a man . Canby 's arm was in pitiful shape . Nate Person thought it ought to be amputated right then , but Canby bellowed , Christ , not my shootin ' arm . ' Next day it began to fester , and even Jim could see that there was n't much chance to save it . They put Canby in the wagon and Jim rode with him for most of that day , fetching him water and lighting his cigarettes , and he told the southerner , You better let ' em cut it off , Canby . It'sp481festerin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well die as lose my gun arm . ' The column was now eleven miles to the east of Las Vegas , that wild , inviting frontier town , and the men begged Poteet to lay over and allow them a spree , but he said , No . No leave in Las Vegas . ' When the men asked why , he said , We ca n't leave the herd unprotected , and we 've got to push on to the doctor at Fort Union . ' He nodded toward the wagon , where Canby lay in delirium , and the men complained no more . There was a saying on the trails : If a man gets sick or wounded , only two things he can decently do . Get well or die quick . ' It looked as if Canby would do the latter , for since he refused to have his arm cut off , it was poisoning his entire body . Two days later Mr. Poteet made up his mind . He told Nacho , Lash your cooking gear to the backs of horses . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There an army doctor would know what to do , and Poteet and Skimmerhorn rode off , leaving command of the outfit to Nate Person . On the second , afternoon Poteet and Skimmerhorn returned to camp with the wagon , but without Canby . The doctor took one look at the arm and said , " Off it comes . " ' Poteet explained . Canby fought like hell , and it took three men to lash him down before they could get the chloroform to him . ' No one spoke , and he added , We paid him off and he 'll go back to Texas . ' His horse is here , ' Buck said . We bought his horse , ' Poteet said . Mr. Skimmerhorn paid him well , ' and no more was said by anyone . It was about five-thirty in the afternoon . Never before on the trip had they camped at such a beautiful spot , with low mountains to the north , dark-blue piiion trees everywhere , and to the west the high snowcoveredpeaks of New Mexico . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nacho Gomez began putting his gear back in the wagon Mr. Poteet turned to Nate and asked , Are you well rested ? ' The black man said he was , and Poteet said , Men , we 've had a hard trip and Canby 's misfortune weighs upon us all . With Mr. Skimmerhorn 's permission I have brought you a change of diet . ' And he uncovered six bottles of whiskey . As the men cheered , Poteet added , Mr. Skimmerhorn has agreed to guard the remuda . Mr. Person and I will watch the herd . ' Forgetting even Nacho 's good cooking , the cowboys opened the whiskey bottles and sat about the fire till midnight , drinking and telling more and more outrageous stories with less and less clarity until one by one they fell asleep . Through the night Mr. Poteet and Nate Person rode guard , and as they passed each other in the darkness the black man said invariably , Evenin ' , Mr. Poteet , ' and Poteet said softly , Evenin ' , Nate , ' and they rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My horse is weary , Nate . I 'll ride in and fetch a replacement , ' and when he returned ,  |p482Nate  asked , Are they givin ' that boy whiskey ? ' and Poteet said , Three things a man 's got to learn to handle  --  a gun , a glass of whiskey and a girl . He do n't learn by readin ' . ' And they rode through that starry night , thinking of poor Canby with his arm gone , and of dead Comanche and of their good luck so far . And whenever they passed , Nate said , Evenin ' , Mr. Poteet , ' and he replied , Evenin ' , Nate . ' At dawn the hands awakened from their stupors , as sorry a lot as ever proposed to herd cattle , and Mr. Poteet said , We 'll move north , ' and Nate said , Mr. Poteet , I like good whiskey just like anybody else , ' and Old Rags said , Well , there ai n't none left , ' and Mr. Poteet glared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry , ' and he went to Mr. Skimmerhorn 's sleeping bag and produced a half-full bottle , handing it to the black man . Nate guzzled a huge drink , blinked his eyes and told Jim Lloyd , That is good . ' He took three more real belts , then became glassy-eyed and looked around for a place to lie down . Mr. Poteet guided him to the wagon , helped him in and took away the bottle , and all that morning Nate rode inside , his mouth agape like a stranded sunfish . Six days later the herd reached Raton Pass , that high and difficult route from New Mexico to Colorado , and there , blocking their way , stood Uncle Dick Wootton , one of the wildest pioneers of the west . He had done everything , traveled everywhere . His name appeared in the lists of the earliest trappers attending the rendezvous in western Wyoming , and now in his later years he had come upon what he called a good thing . ' By chicanery so devious that no one had yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico and Colorado into allowing him to build , with Indian and Mexican labor , a rude passagewaythrough the mountains , following Raton Pass and making of it a toll road , which he guarded with a gang of toughs carrying Winchesters . Ten cents a head , ' he told Nate Person , who was scouting ahead . We 're bringin ' a lot of head , ' Person explained . Then you 'll pay a lot of ten centses , ' the old reprobate replied . Nate rode back to tell Mr. Poteet , whose thin lips tightened , makinghis jaw muscles stand out . He said quietly , Mr. Person , I 'll borrow yourextra gun , if I may . ' And off he rode . His meeting with the old robber was conducted with high formality , as if heads of state were discussing tariffs . Poteet said , You know , Uncle Dick , ten cents a head is too much . ' It 's my road , ' the old man said , and that 's my charge . ' But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . ' We 'll do the countin ' . You do the payin ' . ' For that number it ought n't to be over six cents a head . '  |p483For  any number it 's ten cents . ' Uncle Dick , you 're being downright unreasonable . ' I 'm bein ' downright practical , ' the old trapper said . I built the road . You 'll pay for usin ' it . ' You miserable son-of-a-bitch ! ' Poteet cursed . Then , reviling him Texas-style , he threatened to put him out of business . You ca n't talk to Wootton like that , ' one of his henchmen said . Drawing his guns , Poteet said , One of you makes a move  --  just one  --  and I 'll blow this miserable old bastard to hell . ' The men backed off , and Poteet kept his guns on Wootten and said , I 'm goin ' back down that pass and find me another way through these mountains . ' He cursed the pirate for a full minute , thrust his guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assembling his men , he told them , This herd will never go over that pass . I will not be made a fool of . ' Skimmerhorn argued that the cattle were here , ready to go , and he felt sure that Mr. Seccombe would understand and be willing to pay the two hundred and ninety-five dollars . Not while I 'm trail boss , ' Poteet snapped , and that discussion was closed . Calling Nate Person to his side , he said , Nate and I are goin ' to scout this whole state till we find a pass north . Bring the cattle east after us . ' Again Mr. Skimmerhorn demurred . Why not camp here till we 're sure we 've found a pass ? Then , if there is none , we can still use Wootton 's .. Mr. Skimmerhorn ! ' Poteet shouted . I am in command ! Take those cattle east to the volcano ! Now ! ' In a fury he rode eastward with his black guide , and together they probed all the high country leading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way abating , he ordered Person to ride back and see that the cattle kept moving eastward while he proceeded to the various mountains , probing , testing and still finding nothing . Nate told the cowboys , The old man 's in such a rage . At this rate we could go all the way east to Kentucky ! ' Stay with him , ' Skimmerhorn said . He 'll work out something . ' So the black man rode back , but it was two days before he could find Poteet , for the wiry Texan had ridden far into Colorado over a rocky pass that cattle could not possibly use . Nevertheless , when Person met him riding south he was grinning . We 've got it , Nate , ' he exulted . On the way in I found nothin ' , but on the way back , a smooth , level turnpike . And we 'll tell every cattlemanin Texas about it . We 'll break that old bastard 's heart . ' They rode back to where the herd was approaching Capulin , that splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect peak except for one side knocked off during the last eruption . He directed the men to bring the cattle up past the west side of the volcano , heading them due north , and as the last of the strays passed into Colorado , Mr.p484Poteet turned west toward where Raton Pass stood far in the distance and shouted , as if the old robber could hear him , To hell with you , Dick Wootton ! ' At the end of the first full day in Colorado they came fo the Picketwire , the western river with the most delicate name . It was properly El Rio de Las Animas Perdido en Purgatorio . In Coronado 's time three difficult and greedy Spanish soldiers had revolted and struck out on their own to find the cities of gold . Sometime later the main body of explorers came upon them , naked and riddled with arrows , and one of the priests explained solemnly , God struck them down , using Indians as his agents , and for their disobedience their souls remain in purgatory . ' The River of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Purgatoire , and practical men from Indiana and Tennessee , adapting the sound to their own tongue , called it Picketwire . It was not a difficult river to cross , and three days later they reached the stream they had been seeking , the Apishapa , whose name was far less romantic in origin than the Picketwire . It was a Ute word meaning stinking water and it was well named , for the water had an unpleasant taste , but it was potable and it led toward the end of the trail . Potect was quite willing to follow the Apishapa , because this kept the outfit well east of Pueblo and Denver  --  two hellholes where cowboys were concerned  --  and they were on this safe eastern course when Nate Person came riding back in some excitement . Santa Fe Trail ! ' he shouted . Dead ahead , ' and when they came to a rise they looked north and saw it . Heading west along the ancient trail was a procession of some magnitude : first came a detachment of cavalry , then seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards bringing up the rear . It was a recapitulation of the west , of all the wagons that had passed this way since Spaniards first developed the road , and the young Texans , who had seen nothing like it before , watched with delight as the procession crossed their trail . Mr. Poteet rode ahead to ask the cavalrymen why they were escortingthe train , since the Comanche were so far to the south , and the captain in charge said condescendingly , Kansas outlaws . ' Not this far west , surely . ' They 've been driven out of Kansas , ' the captain said . Last month they raided into New Mexico . ' The Pettis boys ? ' Yes . ' Hell , ' Mr. Poteet said in disgust . I thought we were safe . ' On this trail you 're never safe , ' the captain said haughtily , as if he were addressing a lowly private , and rode off toward Santa Fe . That night Poteet warned the hands that they were heading into dangerouscountry . Worse than the Comanche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaws and they 're killers . '  |p485Who  are they ? ' Jim Lloyd asked the younger cowboys , and Gompertsaid , Confederates . Like Old Coker and his damned McClellan saddle . ' They 're men who fought and lost , ' Coker snapped . Just like me . ' How did they get to Kansas ? ' Jim asked . How did Old Coker get to Texas ? They walked till they got a chance to steal some horses . ' They 're killers now , ' Coker said . If they come at us , Coker , will you join ' em ? You 're a Confederate . ' ' So 's Poteet . You think he 'll join ' em ? ' And so the younger men joshed and argued as they headed for outlaw country . The Apishapa emptied into the Arkansas River in a valley that showed great promise of becoming good agricultural land . A man could raise crops here , ' Savage said approvingly as the Crown Vee cattle headed for the lush grass that lined the bottomlands . This is the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Skimmerhorn warned , and the men allowed the animals to graze and take it easy for a day . Crossing the Arkansas was the most difficult feat on the trail , for this river ran dark and swift and was cut by sand banks which presented special problems . Mr. Poteet and Nate spent half a day trying to calculatewhere the safest spot would be , and they finally decided upon a relativelynarrow area some miles east of the Apishapa , and there they led their cattle into the cold , fast-running water . It was a lively crossing , with two horses being swept downstream when they lost their footing , and no sooner were they recovered than a cantankeroussteer they called Mean Red decided , in midstream , to head back for the south shore , and he took half a hundred steers and young bulls with him . They ran into the bunch being brought across by Jim and Coker , and there was a frightful milling in mid-river , with weaker animalsgoing under , and all of them bawling and slashing about with their monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that red steer in the face ! Turn him around ! ' What should have required forty minutes consumed four hours , and v tempers were totally frayed when the herd finally assembled on the north bank . Eleven cattle had drowned in the panic . Some cowboys ! ' Poteet lashed out . You , Coker ! When you saw that red steer messing things up , why did n't you shoot him ? ' You told us not to use our guns , ' Coker snapped back . Poteet 's face reddened and he was obviously ready for a fight , eager for one , perhaps , and it was clear that Coker would accommodate him , but Mr. Skimmerhorn broke it up by saying , We were lucky to make it withoutlosing more than we did , ' and Poteet walked over to the remuda and gave Buck hell for not having the horses in shape . He 's worried about the Kansans , ' Lasater said . And so am I. ' Soon Poteet came back and unrolled Canby 's bed things . He had beenp486guarding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now he passed out Canby 's guns . A second revolver to Jim Lloyd . One to Coker , the others to the swing men . He gave one Winchesterto Nate Person and the other to Mr. Skimmerhorn . The .22 he kept for himself . Some people have deceived themselves by trying to buy the Pettis boys off . . . giving them a share of the cattle , ' he said . We wo n't . ' Four men rode guard that night , and next day Poteet moved the remudaand the cook wagon to the left flank . He posted an extra guard on the right flank and the day passed without incident , but shortly after dawn on the second day north of the Arkansas , all hell broke loose . A band of sixteen Kansas outlaws led by the two Pettis boys swept in from a nest of low hills and launched a full-scale attack against the cattlemen . The Kansans had fine horses , which they handled well . Driving straight at the cattle , they tried to cut the herd in half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men tending the rear portion and make off with many cattle and horses . But Bufe Coker greeted them with such heavy fire from his LeMat that they had to swing well south of the rear , which put them on the left flank , where they had a free run at Nacho Gomez and the remuda . When Mr. Poteet and Skimmerhorn saw what was happening , they rode breakneck to help , but their support was not needed , for Nacho had unlimbered his Third Dragoon and stood before his cook wagon , feet apart , with the deadly weapon at his shoulder . His aim was not good : one volley went over the heads of the Kansans , a second into the dust beneath their horses ' hoofs . But he created such a racket and waved his carbine with such fury that the Kansans decided to leave him alone . Before they could get to the remuda , Poteet and Skimmerhorn were throwing showers of lead , and the invaders swung in a wide curve to the head of the column , where Lasater waited grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , and miraculouslyno one was killed , neither outlaw nor cattleman . Twice Jim Lloyd caught a glimpse of the Pettis boys , mean-looking mustached men wearing suspenders and derbies , who waved their pistols as they rushed past . They were killers , and Jim knew that if the cowboys wavered even a little , the Kansans would override them and shoot them all . It looked as if the Texans had won a victory , for the outlaws were withdrawing to the east , but then the younger of the Pettis boys wheeled his horse about , gave a mighty shout and led a final charge , right into Jim Lloyd , killing his horse and wounding Jim in the left arm . Coker saw that Jim was defenseless , and before a new attack could gun the boy down , he spurred his horse right at the oncoming Kansans and exploded his LeMat shotgun into the men 's faces . There was a fountainof blood , a human head flying in bits over the landscape , a horse galloping madly with a tottering driver , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon.  |p487After  the Kansans withdrew , the weary cowboys sat on the ground , breathing heavily as each man reloaded . Mr. Skimmerhorn had hurried to Jim Lloyd and found him loading his two revolvers , while blood ran down his left arm in a trickle . His bravery was reviewed at the campfire : Old Jim just stood there and took the full charge . Why in hell did n't you fire at ' em ? ' He said , I was too scared . ' Coker did not join in the discussion . He was shaken by the killing of the outlaw and finally confided to Ragland , I have killed my brother . ' Jesus , ' Ragland told the others . The Confederate killed his own brother , ' and Mr. Poteet left what he was doing and went to Coker and asked , How can you say he was your kin ? ' and Coker said , Any man who fought northern tyranny was my kin , ' and he dug a grave at the foot of a small hill and buried the outlaw , raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook wagon , on which he scratched : HERE LIESA CONFEDERATE SOLDIERNAME UNKNOWNKILLED IN FAIR FIGHTBY A BEAUREGARD LEMATOF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVENFor two nights Coker could speak with no one and then on the third he said at the fire , I wo n't go back to Texas . I 'll take my pay and keep movin ' . I hear Australia 's a good place . ' Such talk created gloom in camp , for as they approached the end of the trail , each man wondered what he could find to do next . Lasater , wishing to halt such speculation , turned to Coker and asked , How 'd you get that gun , Coker ? ' and the Confederate said , Same way 's I got the saddle . ' " And how was that ? ' Lasater probed . It was in the Shenandoah Valley . Stonewall Jackson was dead and they were pressin ' us on all sides , and there was this Confederate colonelwe were followin ' and he had this real good pistol which he was alwayspolishin ' , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine ordinary bullets , and then a sawed-off shotgun , all in this size . ' He passed the deadly weapon among his companions and they marveled at its complexityand its deadly concentration of fire power . It had two barrels , a small one for bullets and a very large , blunt one for the buckshot . I kept pretty close to the colonel , figuring he was bound to get hit sooner or later , and each time we attacked the Yanks , I kept urgin ' him on , " Go to it , Colonel ! Move up closer ! " And he kept makin ' a hero of hisself and I kept on his heels , and after a while I noticed that a man from North Calinky was doggin ' him too , and I could see he had his eyep488on that LeMat , and if there 's one thing I ca n't stand , it 's a North Calinky man . They got no character , no courage and when the colonel was finallyhit , the North Calinky man jumped for the LeMat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attend to , the competition . I swung the butt of my gun around and just about knocked his head off , and only then did I stoop down to pick up the LeMat . ' And the McClellan saddle ? ' About the same . A Yankee colonel lookin ' for glory , so we let him through and a Georgia man shot him and his horse fell practically in my lap , so I took the saddle . ' It 's a pitiful saddle , ' Lasater said . Damned hole down the middle . ' I ai n't had no trouble with it . ' That 's right , ' Lasater said generously . You sure rode down that Confederateand blew his head off . ' I did it in sorrow , ' Coker said . I thought he 'd killed Old Jim . ' Ragland broke into untimely laughter and the men turned toward him . He looked to check whether Mr , Poteet was listening , then confided , Old R. J. thought hisself so smart , takin ' us acrost that desert to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into both . Might just as well have come straight north and saved ourselves the trouble : ' But as Lasater pointed out , Doin ' it your way , we face the Indians and the outlaws on their own land , where they 'd have reinforcements . Doin ' it R. J. 's way , we got ' em at the end of their string , ' and the others agreed . Only now did Jim begin to pay attention to the strangest man in the outfit . Calendar had ridden with the longhorns for over a thousand miles , yet no one really knew him , a silent , thin man of twenty who acted as if he were fifty . Twice Jim had shared night watches with him , and the man had not spoken a word . As he sang to the restless cattle , he did so in a voice so low they could hardly hear him , as if he were taking from them a reassurance he needed rather than the other way around : The grass is green , the hills are brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gals wo n't pester me henceforth . I 'm cuttin ' out , I 'm headin ' north . ' He sang in a whisper , and Jim , listening close to catch the words , asked , Where 'd you learn that song ? I do n't know it . ' But Calendar passed on without comment , singing softly to himself : Got my rope and got my saddle , Think it best that I skedaddle . I do n't want no shotgun weddin ' . Colorado 's where I 'm headin ' . '  |p489But  now as they reached the bounteous plains of that territory , with deer and antelope plentiful , Calendar came into his own . He had a rifle made by Christian Sharps of Harper 's Ferry , a handsome blue-steel affair that laid a bullet accurately at two hundred yards . Six cowboys would ride out for deer , but only he , stalking silently in his own way , would come back with venison . How do you do it ? ' Jim asked one day . I look , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further questions . Buck the wrangler was an outcast because of his awful smell ; he really had no choice . But Calendar ostracized himself deliberately because he preferred being alone . He wanted to be on the prairie with his Sharps rifle and a good horse , and that was all . He did nothing to offend the other cowboys , but he did avoid ordinary human contacts . The west contained hundreds like him , silent men who could shoot straight and survive anywhere . One morning as the cowboys were heading north onto that great empty plateau which fills the area between the Platte and the Arkansas , they saw a mass of low shapes on the horizon . What 's that ? ' Poteet called to Person , and he shouted back , It ca n't be Indians . ' Everyone brought his guns into position and watched as the shapes moved closer . They spread over a huge area , and finally Person galloped back , shouting , Buffalo ! ' and soon a gigantic herd of black beasts bore down upon the cowboys . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the front of the column , if it could be called such , was about four miles across  --  four miles of milling buffalo . Behind the leaders the mighty herd covered the earth for a score of miles , a massive black-brown unit that seemed to move with a single purpose . Hold the cattle ! ' Poteet shouted as the great beasts came down upon them . The buffalo were now less than a hundred yards away , coming at the men at an angle . The cattle , bemused by such a moving mass , seemed hypnotized , and slowly , without the men 's being aware of what was happening , the buffalo herd parted slightly , the leaders going north and south of the longhorns . The Texans , with all their herd and horses , were encapsulated in the midst of the buffalo . For hours this incredible movement of animals continued . At times Jim could reach out his hand and feel them passing beneath it , one by one , large hairy creatures with handsome bearded faces and dark , piercingeyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so docile that the men began tugging at their horns and patting their rumps as they went past , and still they came , the last remnant of that enormous herd of thirty million that had once roamed the land between the two rivers.  |p490Ai  n't they ever gon na pass ? ' Savage called . When the final straggler was gone , the Texans were silent , as if they had just come from church , until Mr. Poteet said , I never saw anything like that before , ' and Mr. Skimmerhorn said , You may never see it again , ' and Ragland said , Why , you think they 're goin ' somewheres ? ' and Mr. Skimmerhorn said , Yes , to their death . ' No one could believe it . Took four hours to pass , ' Ragland said , and Savage asked , How would you know , you ai n't got no watch , ' and Raglandsaid , I can tell . ' Calendar suddenly spurred his horse , galloped onto a little hill , dismounted , dropped to one .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buffalo and sent a bullet into the spot where the neck joined the body . The stricken animal twisted to the right , tried to control its legs , then collapsed in a spasm . It was a perfect kill . What in hell did you do that for ? ' Poteet raged when Calendar rode back , abandoning the carcass . Man 's got to know how to use his gun , ' Calendar said , and that 's all he would say . Jim rode guard with him that night and tried vainly to engage him in conversation . No use  --  the thin Texan attended his rounds , singing in his whispery voice : She was bright and she was pretty , Sweetest gal in Kansas City . But her maw was a real terror . I 'm headin ' north to hide my error . ' The presence of the buffalo , so many for so long a time , and the firing of Calendar 's rifle , had baffled the longhorns , and they showed signs of unrest . Jim , as he circled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be troublesome , and Mean Red , the steer who had turned back in the river , started once to head for open country , but Calendar anticipated the move and rode at him briskly , waving the Sharps in the steer 's face until the brute turned back . Nice ridin ' , ' Jim said as they passed , but Calendar made no answer . They prevented trouble that night , but on the next the damnedest thing happened . Mr. Skimmerhorn , returning from his ten-to-twelve guard , dismounted and stepped smack in the middle of Coker 's McClellansaddle . His foot got trapped in the opening and he kicked to free himself , but the saddle could not be shaken off , and he stumbled into the fire , knocking over the coffeepot . There was a sharp clatter  --  and the cattle were off . It is said that no man has ever seen the start of a stampede . He hears an unfamiliar noise , sees a blur , and within one second three thousand cattle who appeared to have been sleeping are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just once . Then , tight-lipped , he sped into the night . Stampede ! ' flashed through the camp , and each man leaped out of his blankets , grabbed for the bridle of his night horse and set out automaticallyin the direction of the greatest noise . Where 's my saddle ? ' Coker shouted in the darkness . Get the damned thing off my foot , ' Skimmerhorn yelled , and the two wrestled for a moment , finally freeing Skimmerhorn . Then each leaped for his horse , and only Nacho Gomez was left alone in the camp . This was a strange and wild stampede . Mercifully , the land was flat , so there was no danger of plunging down a sudden arroyo , but being flat , it also encouraged the animals to run , and all that night they did so , not in one direction , but in a hundred . Each cowboy settled upon some fleeing group of longhorns , thinking that he was working the main body , but each fought with only a fragment . Lasater , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milling circle , effectively stopping them , only to find that as he did so , a much larger herd swept past , luring his group behind them . Gompert managed to intercept Mean Red and some six hundred of his followers , but this accomplished nothing , because they represented only a small portion of the herd , and besides , he had no one to help him hold them , and when another group roared past , their hoofs thundering on the hard earth , Mean Red and his longhorns joined them , and were seen no more that night . By two in the morning R. J. Poteet 's longhorns were scattered over a large portion of middle Colorado . There seemed no discernible order in the cowboys ' attempts to reassemble them ; Poteet and Person , well schooled in such affairs , were as powerless as the novices , riding first here , then there , cursing the while . Bring some discipline into this ! ' Poteet shouted at his black assistant , and Person , futilely trying to chase down several hundred cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that night , to Poteet 's disgust , groups of cattle and cowboys rampaged across the flat prairie , and when dawn broke , the animals were scattered in at least fourteen different groups . Poteet , surveying the scene in the beautiful pale light that comes before sunrise , could ' only say , Christ ! ' He then began to direct a sensible effort at bringing the far-flung cattleback to one spot . Person ! Get that bunch over on the horizon ! Coker ! Bring in those strays and get a center started . ' It was noon before the exhausted cowboys succeeded in reassembling the herd , and when Poteet made a rough count , he concluded that some two hundred were missing . Where can they be ! ' he asked the men , for the prairie was so flat that any rise could be seen for five or six miles , and after riding out in various directions , the cowboys reported , No cattle anywhere , ' and then Jim Lloyd , who was always gazing at thep492horizon in search of birds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distanthill the missing cattle were grazing , their black silhouettes showing against the first rays of the sun . Fetch ' em , ' Poteet cried in disgust , and Jim and Calendar rode in silence for at least seven miles to bring back the docile creatures . When they approached camp , Mean Red , who had led them on their escapade , broke into a trot , delighted to rejoin the herd and ready for the next gallop . That one we get rid of , ' Poteet said , but before anyone could ask how , Nate Person rode back from a scouting trip to the north with the ominous news : Indians . ' Oh , Christ ! ' Poteet said . Not again ! ' And for the first time on this trip the cowboys saw R. J. wilt . For a moment his shoulders sagged , but just for a moment . All right ! All right ! ' he shouted . Form up . ' And he placed his men at strategic positions from which they could repel the Indian attack . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bedraggled Indians on fleshless horses . They were led by an old chief , a dumpy little fellow wearing a tall-crowned hat with a single feather . They ai n't Comanche , ' Lasater whispered . They were Arapaho , emaciated and without spirit . Food , ' the old chief pleaded . We got no food , ' Ragland replied . Food . We are starving , ' the old man pleaded a second time . Mr. Potcet rode up and asked , What 's he want , Gompert ? ' Food . Says his tribe is starving . ' They look it . ' Poteet left the Indians to talk with Skimmerhorn . They 're your cattle , ' he said . Let 's give them one , ' Skimmerhorn said , and Gompert , overhearing the decision , yelled , Let 's give ' em Mean Red ! ' and the cowboys applauded , so Mr. Poteet rode back to the Indians and said , Mr. Skimmerhorn here says . . Did you say Skimmerhorn ? ' the old man asked . Yes , ' Skimmerhorn replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat their horses , uneasy , each looking directly into the eyes of the other , saying nothing , and after a while Mr. Skimmerhorn rode closer and extended his hand to the old man , and indicated three steers the Indians could have . We are not beggars , ' Lost Eagle said . We are starving . There is no way left for us to feed ourselves , ' and he rode to each of the cowboys , shaking his hand and thanking him for his generosity . That was how Mean Red left the herd . The nights were peaceful now and daytime work was kept to a minimum , for Mr. Poteet was in no hurry to cover the last two hundred miles . He do n't fool me none , ' Rag/land told the men around the campfire . He 's lollygaggin ' so 's them critters 'll put on weight . ' In these last days Jim had his first good chance to study the plains of Colorado , and everything he saw pleased him : the golden-brown color , the gently rising sweeps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkening at the edges , and day after day the cloudless sky , an arc of blue enclosing an untouched paradise . If I ever saw land made for cattle , ' he told Savage , this is it . ' He liked especially the crystal air , thinner than the humid atmosphere of Texas and infinitely cleaner . A man could breathe this air and feel each particle creeping into his lungs , bringing health . As trail 's end came closer , so did the men . Intense friendships sprang up where before there had been only courteous respect . I got to say that for a nigger , Nate Person knows his horses , ' Coker admitted , and Ragland , no great lover of Mexicans , paid a similar grudging tribute to Nacho Gomez : He sure knows how to make crusty biscuits . ' They spoke often of Mule Canby , and when they did , Jim felt remorse at not having paid Canby the ten dollars he owed him for the Army Colt 's . How will he earn his livin ' with only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm make it , ' Coker said . You disqualify all the men with one arm or one leg , hell , you 'd have to throw out half the men in South Calinky . We had a bad war . ' Speakin ' of one leg , ' Lasater said , they was this pretty little gal in San Antonio had only one leg . All the women felt sorry for her . " What 's Letitia gon na do with one leg ? " And you know , all the men felt sorry for her too , so as a result little Letitia got more . . Here Mr. Poteet interrupted , indicating with a nod that Jim Lloyd was in the audience , and Lasater ended lamely , She got more attention than most gals with two legs . ' Jim felt he understood what Lasater was leading up to . There was a lot of joshing , too . Again and again cowboys recalled Old Rags tryin ' to jump the Pecos and fallin ' flat on his ass , ' and Ragland protested that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have jumped it . . . but you saw for yourself how the bank was slippy and downhill . ' Hell , on the best day you ever lived you could n't jump that river , ' Savage responded . So a small wager was arranged , and Mr. Poteet and Mr. Skimmerhorn were given the job of stepping off eighteen feet , with a clean level approach , and a heavy starting line was drawn in the earth , and Savage said , One inch over that line and you lose . ' So Ragland backed way up , scrunched up his body , yelled , Here we go ! ' and came tearing down the approach , arms and legs flying in all directions . As he approached the line , he gathered his strength in one mighty effort and sailed a good six inches beyond the far bank of the river . My God ! He done it ! ' Lasater shouted , and now the men enteredp494their endless and tedious review : It 's true that Old Rags fell in the Pecos when he tried it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run . . . hell , he cleared it and then some . ' Jim , watching the cowboys in these final days , experienced a sadness he could not control . He saw things clearly . If this particular group could be held together , each man lending strength to his companion , they could build themselves a good life . Even Lasater might be kept in line , but when they broke up and each had to fend for himself , troubles might well overtake them . Not Mr. Poteet or Nate Person . They were grown men , solidly constructed ; you could trust them anywhere , and they 'd get the job done . But Lasater ? Wild , splendid Lasater who would risk anything . He was bound to run into trouble , for basically he was weak . Jimprayed thatMr . Poteet would allow Lasater to stay with him for the trip back to Texas . And Ragland , he was sure to get himself mixed up with women and make a mess of one affair after another . . . Then he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His own cow , wandering bereft across the alkali flats . . . Stonewall shot dead at the moment of triumph . . . the cattle drowned at the crossing . . . the dead buffalo . . . God , he wished he could ride forever with these men . Just keep riding toward some distant horizon behind which the Comanche and the Kansansand the unfordable rivers lay . But it could not be . Trails end , and compani/-s of men fall apart . What would he do , a fourteen-year-old boy on the loose in a vast new territory ? Something would turn up . He liked animals , and something would turn up . On the last night watch before they reached the Platte , the two-tofour , as he rode with Coker he asked , Was it really your brother , the one you shot ? ' They made a complete circle , and Coker said , He was my brother and you 're my brother . ' They made another complete circle while Jim pondered this , and on the next turn Coker said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months , that makes ' em brothers , do n't it ? ' Jim weighed this , and on the next turn Coker said , If you ever need help , Jim . . . ' He left the rest unspoken , and the long night passed . On the night of July 12 , 1868 , Mr. Skimmerhorn announced at the last campfire , Tomorrow we reach our pasture , ' and the cowboys reactedin a way that surprised Jim , for each man broke out fresh clothing , used his hands to press his bandanna free of wrinkles , even polished his saddle . For the first time Jim realized how vain these men were , what pride they had in their profession , and when dawn of that last day broke ,  |p495each  man rode a little straighter and spoke with a quieter precision , for they had accomplished a considerable feat and they knew it . They had herded nearly three thousand longhorns thirteen hundred miles , with minimum loss , and they were proud . When word of their approach reached Zendt 's Farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Texas that everyonewalked out to watch . The cowboys , with a larger audience than expected , outdid themselves in crisp commands and boldly waved signals . Lasater even unholstered his revolver , using it to signal the lead steers into the water . The crossing was so easy it seemed an afterthought . Not much like the Arkansas , ' Ragland said scornfully , but Mr. Skimmerhorn pointed to the farthest banks of the valley and told him , You thank your stars this river is n't in flood . It reaches from there to there . ' But Ragland was n't listening . He had spotted a pretty girl . You did it , John ! ' the newspaper editor shouted as the cattle climbed up the north bank . He did it , ' Skimmerhorn called back , giving credit to Poteet . What 's more , he 's gon na do it for us again . ' Ahead , to greet them as they forded the river , stood Oliver Seccombe : Well done , men . The cattle look fine . ' The crowd separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon past the ladies and on to the final camping ground . When Buck brought his remuda across , Mr. Poteet assembled the cowboys , who were pleased for another chance to posture among the townspeople , and told them , Each of you is to pick one horse from the remuda . A present from Mr. Skimmerhorn . The other horses , ' he said , raising his voice so that the townsmen could hear , will be sold , tomorrow noon . ' Where ? ' the horse-hungry locals asked . We 'll bring ' em in town , so look ' em over . ' Insistently , as if they had a corporate will of their own , the cattle pressed north and the men followed . The last river had been crossed , the last danger repulsed . Jim Lloyd had stayed on the south bank with Coker , who , wishing to display his horsemanship , made a great show of rounding up the strays , but Jim , behaving more sedately , scrambled his horse up the north bank , and as he came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young girl , the most astonishingly beautiful girl he had ever seen . She had a dark complexion , black eyes and ebony hair , which she wore in ribboned braids . She was almost as tall as he , and her face had that brazen look which challenges men . When he stared at her , she stared back , her eyes like pools of clear water at the far edge of the Llano . He sat very tall in his saddle and smiled down like a conquistador . She broke into a disrespectful laugh , and when he was past he asked Mr. Skimmerhorn , Who 's that girl ? ' Skimmerhorn turned in his saddlep496and said , That 's Levi Zendt 's daughter . She 's part Indian , ' and Jim said quietly , I 'm goin ' to marry her , ' and the herd moved on . CAUTION TO US EDITORS : Please , please make your artist exercise restraintin illustrating this section . I have studied forty-seven photographs of groups of cowboys in the years 1867-68-69 , and not one appears in chaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus high-heeled boots and bandanna . The Denver Public Library has nine photographs of R. J. Poteet in the early years before he put together his big ranch northwest of Jacksboro , and he is not gussied up . He shows no flamboyance but a good deal of solid character . Do not allow your artists to portray these cowboys as big men . Most of the good ones were slight . Boone McClure of that admirable PanhandlePlains Historical Museum just south of Amarillo is my authority for the statement : We had this convocation of famous living cowboys , and three were picked as most representative . I 'm only five-feet-six , and every one of those men was no taller than I. ' Few towering cowboys like those depicted by John Wayne and Joel McCrea , existed in those early days . From various photographs which contained reference points I have calculated the height of our thirteen men . We know that John Skirnmerhorn was tall , like his father , say 6-1 , but he was not a Texas cowboy . R. J. Poteet was not over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in at about that level too . Nate Person was a mite taller , but Gompert , Nacho , Coker and Buck were all 5-4 or less . Lasater might have run to 5-7 , but only Ragland had any real height , 5-10 at the most generous . Jim Lloyd was a special case . At fourteen he was only 5-5 , but he added some inches later . Be careful how you handle John Chisum on that gigantic spread along the Pecos River . Do n't confuse him with Jesse Chisholm , 1806-68 , after whom the greatest of the cattle trails was named , posthumously , as a matter of fact . Recent motion pictures have been making our Chisum a notable hero of the west . The facts do not support this . Tough ? Yes . Fearless ? I wonder . He never carried a gun on the theory that the code of the west forbade the shooting of an unarmed man , and he knew that a lot of people wanted to shoot him . He hired others to do his killing for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ when finally shot . In protecting his assumed acres , he was ruthless , and in disciplining Mexicanshe suspected of encroaching on the land he did n't own , he was pitiless . I 've read all that 's available on Chisum and find him at best an unlovely man . If you wish to cut him from the text , feel free.  |p497On  the other hand , I have tried to be restrained in depicting R. J. Poteet . In retrospect he seems better than I have said , a trail-hardened man who engaged in every aspect of range life without ever having been charged with a bad performance . In the 1870s he shot bandits and in the 1890s endowed a college . In the 1880s he ran squatters off his land , but in the 1900s gave land he owned for the founding of five different towns . He was the first to import to the prairies really good breed bulls from England , the first to bring in Black Angus cattle , the first to experiment with irrigation . A nice touch . In later years Poteet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed Nate Person to carry the outfit 's money . Not only was Nigger Nate the best hand I had , but if the outlaws did ride us down , there was little likelihood they would search Nate for the money , he being black and they being from the south . ' Trouble spot . Records of several long drives to the north indicate that many trail bosses took the eight cowboys who enclosed the herd  --  two points , two swings , two flanks and two drags  --  and rotated each man through each of the eight positions , clockwise , and some reader familiar with this may give you flak . R. J. Poteet argued that he wanted his top experts at the two points , with the best man riding left and the next best right . He also had a rule that if young or inexperienced cowboys wanted to ride with him , they had to prove themselves by making their first trip at drag , and so far as I can ascertain , he never wavered from this routine . Technical point . Although Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg of the journey , when the trail turned north , as it did once the Pecos was reached , the prevailing northwest wind would throw the greater burden on Bufe Coker riding right drag . Caption material . R. J. Poteet has a passage in one of his letters which you might want to use : I was always impressed by the fact that although we Texans held the Mexican in contempt , our profession and its vocabularywere borrowed from Mexican experience in running cattle south of the Rio Grande . Chaps from chaparejos , lariat from la reata , sombrero , mesquite , latigo , tapadero , bandanna , buckaroo from vaquero , corral , rodeo , remuda , ranch from rancho . While coosie , a word we use for cook , came from cocinero . ' Tell your artist to observe that the northern Texas cowboy invariably tied his lariat to his saddle horn , but a man from the Rio Grande , like Canby , would dally his , that is , give it a couple of twists around the horn , relying on friction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vuelta , to give the turn . ' Llano Estacado . Be careful what you say about this and how you show it on your maps . Few problems in American history are more sticky , because delineation of the area varies radically from one source to another ; it probably extended as far south as the route we follow , but some experts claim it halted farther north . The derivation of the name is to/tally confused , six  --  major theses having been advanced : ( 1 ) Spanish legend says stakes were driven to mark the only trail across the desert . ( 2 ) Indians claim that their ancestors drove stakes to guide an unknownGreat Chief who would come from the east to deliver them from their enemies . ( 3 ) Josiah Gregg , famed historian of western commerce , says the stakes marked the course between water holes . ( 4 ) Later travelersbelieved the stakes had been set and adorned with buffalo skulls to mark the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail . ( 5 ) Naturalists , asking the irritating question In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' explain , From a distance the yucca looks like a stake . ' ( 6 ) Herbert Bolton , the noted historian of the west , is probably closest to the truth when he says that one translation of the Spanish noun estacada is palisade , and in the western reaches of the area there were many spectacular bluffs resembling palisades , tilted and glowing in sunlight . Cattle . Even though I have used a cattle drive originating in Texas , and even though most novels and films have done the same , you must remember that the principal ranches of Wyoming , Montana and even Colorado received the major portion of their cattle not from Texas but from Oregon . The early emigrants traveling westward along the Oregon Trail took with them many first-rate British-bred cows and bulls , and on the Pacific Coast these animals proliferated . Consequently , the typical cattle drive of this period consisted not of scrawny longhorns coming north from Texas but of sleek , well-bred cattle heading east from Oregon.  |p501TWO  OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIbutionsto the use of land in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goldminer with the good German name of Hans Brumbaugh , and he happened to be a Russian because in the year 1764 his great-grandfather , a German farmer , listened when Catherine the Great , the German princess ruling Russia , issued one of the most enticing colonization promises in history : Any German subject consentingto settle in my Russia will be given land practically free and will be insured freedom of worship , freedom from taxation , self-rule within your own German settlement , freedom to conduct education in your own languageand perpetual freedom from military service . ' The Brumbaughs read this glowing invitation posted on the door of their little church in Hesse , where crops had failed for six years and war had ravaged the countryside for seven . They walked to the Baltic port of Lubeck , took ship to St. Petersburg , and sailed down the Volga River till they found a treasury of arable land at Saratov . The Volgadeutsch they were henceforth called , and for thirty-four years they enjoyed a prosperity and a freedom greater than they could have hoped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning Russian , mastering local systems of agriculture , preventing their daughters from marrying Russians  --  but they were happy , and few would have returned to Germany had they been given the opportunity . But not even empresses live forever , and when Catherine finally died in 1796 , her promises to her German settlements were forgotten , and in time the Volgadeutsch marched in Russian regiments just like other peasants , and their schools were nationalized and the old concordat became a scrap of paper . It was then that stubborn peasants like Hans Brumbaugh began to yearn for the freedom which had been stolen from them . At age seventeen he started making himself a nuisance to the Russianp502authorities , so that his mother had to warn him , Hans , be careful . The Czar 's men will hang you . ' At nineteen he was with a group that attacked a military convoy , and that night he left the Volga and clawed his way out of Russia and back to Germany . At twenty-six he had the bad luck to buy a farm in Illinois from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rightful owner forced the sheriff to dispossess him , he decided to quit that state . In January of 1859 he heard of the discovery of gold in Jefferson Territory , as Colorado was then calling itself , and he walked across Missouriand Nebraska , a husky , stoop-shouldered , obstinate man willing to face weather that would have killed an ordinary traveler . Like thousands of others , he stopped briefly at Zendt 's trading post to acquire provisions for the last stage of his journey to Pikes Peak . He was pleased to find in Levi a fellow German , and for the better part of two days they talked in that language ; Levi 's long stay in Pennsylvania had corrupted his mother tongue as much as the Brumbaugh family 's exile in Russia had altered his . A purist would have shuddered at what they called German , but each made himself understood . As they talked , Brumbaugh complained of the high prices Levi was charging , but Levi explained , What I bring in from St. Louis has to be expensive . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Brumbaughsaw that this was true . During his last day at the post he inspected the land Levi was using along the Platte . Good land , ' he said . Where there 's water , ' Levi replied , and this remark caused Brumbaughto examine the benches up from the riverbed , and he listened attentivelywhen Levi said , Nothin 's ever been grown up here , it bein ' so far from water , but if you could get water to it , I 'm convinced it 's the same land as that fruitful stretch down by the river . ' Brumbaugh proceeded to the gold fields , lost himself in the frenzy of Pikes Peak and found not even one nugget . At the end of three months , his supplies gone , his stomach empty and his temper frayed , he developed the first of his significant ideas . He was seated with a group of eleven miners endeavoring to entertain each other with stories , and it occurred to him that they were talking so avidly in an attempt to divert attention from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had energy . But there simply was no food other than flour at twenty-two dollars a barrel and bacon at six dollars a pound , and as one of the men gallantly opened a last can of beans , passingit out among the ravenous miners , Brumbaugh said to himself , Folly ! Men more interested in gold than food . The real money is in the farm . That night he left Pikes Peak , one of the dreariest spots he had ever seen , and three days later , passed the bend in the Platte where the city of Denver was burgeoning . On the fifth day he was back at Zendt 's , asking , How can I get hold of some land ? '  |p503Levi  said , For a farm ? ' Yes . ' And there followed those intricate maneuverings which were becoming common throughout the west . Levi explained how things stood in 1859 : It 's impossible to say who owns the land . McKeag and I staked it out long ago , but we 're still not a legal territory . In law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't squat on it and say , " This land is mine , " because it is n't yours . It 's theirs . ' You have land , ' Brumbaugh pointed out . Correct . It was land owned by my wife 's mother . Full-blooded Arapaho . She gave me a paper , which I filed in St. Louis , showing that I had paid her for it . ' Levi stopped to recall the solemn day when the transfer was made . Clay Basket had ridiculed the idea , but old Alexander McKeag , who could n't read or write , had a Scotsman 's reverence for legal documents , and he insisted that the paper be drawn , witnessed and filed , even though at that time there was no proper place for filing . He himself had carried it to St. Louis for deposit with an official of the Missouri government , witnessed by Cyprian Pasquinel , the congressman . So I claim about eight hundred acres , ' Levi concluded , and I have a legal paper proving it , but whether it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . ' What can I do ? ' Brumbaugh asked . You can squat on Indian land and hope that when law comes this way , title will pass to you , or you can buy some of my land and hope that the title I give you will some day be honored . ' How much an acre ? ' Levi considered this for some time , then said tentatively , For good land along the river , where we know things will grow , ten dollars an acre . For barren land on the benches , two dollars . ' What I 'll do , ' Brumbaugh replied , is buy twenty of your good acres at two hundred dollars and borrow the other forty from the Indians . ' In this way the farm of Hans Brumbaugh was started , and in the spring of 1859 he was planting vegetables , including a large crop of potatoes . Harvesting them as early as possible , he sold some to Levi Zendt and carted the rest to Denver , where he made more cash than he could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called henceforth , the canny Russian who had quit the gold fields to go where the real money was . The second significant thing he did had consequences more far-reaching . By the middle of May in that first season , when it became apparent that the land was good for vegetables , he was in the store one afternoon when the latest contingent of miners came through , eager to buy food , and they spoke so much of impending civil war that Brumbaugh had a sudden vision of what would probably happen . Levi , ' he said when the men were gone , there 's gon na be a war east of Mississippi and precious little food will trickle out here . If you sell me more river land , I can slipp504in an extra crop . I 'll grow twice as much , and you 'll make a fortune selling it . ' I have no spare river land , ' Levi said regretfully . Brumbaugh , a compact , determined man , sat hunched over the end of a box , drawing designs with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you have thousands of acres you have n't mentioned . ' I do , ' Levi replied frankly . Over at Chalk Cliff . So dry it wo n't even grow weeds . ' How 'd you get it ? ' From the Indians . My wife 's father . . . ' He decided not to go into that intricate web . You can have land up there if you want , but you wo n't grow anything on it . ' And you say your river land 's all gone ? ' Mine is . The Indians still have some . ' Oh , no ! If I have to work as hard as I work , I want to own the land . And I want title to it . I got robbed once . ' You 'll get title when we become a legal territory . ' Brumbaugh was not listening . With a dirty finger he had drawn on the box the outlines of the Platte River and the projection of his land lying along it , and as the lines squiggled through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who love land look at maps . This was the river , this was his land , and slowly within the evening darkness the top of the box became alive , and on it there was water and grass and growingvegetables , and it was then that Potato Brumbaugh glimpsed the miracle , the whole marvelous design that could turn The Great AmericanDesert into a rich harvestland . Next morning he got up before dawn , scouted the reach of the Platte River as it ran past his land and satisfied himself that it could be done . But to make sure , he marked a spot high in a cottonwood tree which stood at the eastern end , then retreated to the far western end and watched it as he walked slowly along the riverbank . Yes ! The river did drop perceptibly in its journey past the Brumbaugh land . His daring plan was practical . So he ran to his shack , grabbed his shovel and pickax and went to work . Starting at the extreme western tip , he began to dig a channel which would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was already well watered , but onto the first bench , which was arid . He would lead this small man-made arm of the river down the middle of that bench , thus trebling the size of his arable farm , and at the eastern end he would allow the unused water to find its way back to the Platte . So Brumbaugh harnessed the river and nourished the land . And in the hot summer of 1860 he produced an enormous crop of vegetables , which were sold mainly in Denver . The once-arid land on the bench proved exceptionally fertile as soon as water was brought to it , and Potato Brumbaugh'sfarm became the wonder of Jefferson Territory . As he had fore/seen that wintry night on Pikes Peak , it was the farmer , bringing unlikely acreages into cultivation by shrewd devices , who would account for the wealth of the future state . When Brumbaugh drew water off the Platte , he unwittingly establishedhimself as the first man to tap this river for irrigation purposes , so that even a century later when the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court of the nation , were called upon to adjudicate water rights relating to the river  --  rights of indescribable value  --  they had to come back to one basic consideration : Priority in the use of water deriving from the Platte River dates to Hans Brumbaugh , who first constructed an irrigation ditch in the year 1859 . His rights to this water and the rights of all owners of his land into the endless future must be respected , and all later claims are hereby declaredsubservient to his . At the end of the 1860 growing season Potato Brumbaugh came to the trading post and plopped two hundred dollars on the counter . Levi , can you forward this to St. Louis and have the bank there send it along to my wife in Illinois ? I want her to join me . ' When his wife and children stood at the western end of the holding , near the spot where he had dug the ditch , they were overwhelmed by the size of the farm he pointed out . It seemed bigger than a county in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , it was fortunate that they could not envisage the incredible obstacles they would face in trying to hold on to it . The relationship of a man to his land is never easy . It is perhaps the noblest relationship in the world , after the family , and certainly the most rewarding . But the land must be won , it must be revered , it must be defended . On the afternoon of 1868 when John Skimmerhorn delivered his twenty-nine hundred and thirty-six head of cattle to the emerging VennefordRanch , he happened to look across the milling longhorns and see young Jim Lloyd , still riding drag , but now more like a man than a ganglingboy , and it occurred to Skimmerhorn that if he was given control of the Crown Vee cattle , he would require some tested young fellow to look after the far reaches of the ranch . Accordingly , he spurred his horse and rode to where Oliver Seccombe was eying his new longhorns . Mr. Seccombe , ' Skimmerhorn said , if you acquire the land . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't been idle while you were on the trail . ' Does it extend as far as you proposed ? '  |p506Farther  . ' Then you 'll need some trustworthy hands , and there 's none better than the boy who came north with us . ' Skimmerhorn signaled for Jim to join them , and Seccombe was surprised at his youth . You 're still a kid ! ' he protested . If you drive cattle from Jacksborough across the Llano , ' Skimmerhornsaid , you 're no longer a kid . ' Seccombe shook his head and was about to dismiss the idea , when Skimmerhorn added , This boy has fought off Kansas outlaws and killed a Comanche chief . ' He has ? ' Seccombe asked in disbelief . Hell , he ca n't be more than fourteen . ' He can be anything from fourteen to fifty , ' Skimmerhorn said . Part of the reason your cattle got here , sir , was the courage of this boy . ' He 's hired , ' Seccombe said . Jim Lloyd 's first ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the remainder of his life was an exploration in grandeur , for on the morning when he and Skimmerhorn set forth to position the line camps , they started by riding westward . A hawk flew before them , uttering a wild Scree , scree ' very high in the heavens and flying in three distinct ways : motionless soaring , hovering to inspect the land below , and then the awful swift dive when any small victim was spotted . No birds on earth , not even the eagle or the falcon , were more majestic than these hawks of the west , ranging endlessly over the prairie . Skimmerhorn had decided that to manage the ranch properly , five line camps would be needed , each with a rude hut sleeping six men , plus a stone barn for horses , and he wanted to number them from east to west . Selecting a bleak and lonely spot north of Chalk Cliff , he said , Here 's Camp Five . ' Its back was to the mountains and it overlooked an immensestretch of empty land . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later return with the construction crew . You 'll be able to find it , ' Skimmerhorn said . Just keep your eye on that little stone beaver climbing the face of the tallest mountain . ' Skimmerhorn wanted Line Camp Four convenient to the new Union Pacific Railroad , and this required that they expand into Wyoming Territory . At first the new land was much like the old , completely empty , but toward dusk one day they saw to the east that low piiion trees had somehow established themselves in spite of wind and drought ; they dotted the land with attractive specks of dark green . Their shapes were twisted and they did not grow high , nor were there enough of them to form a forest , but they did create a scene of great natural beauty . This 'll be a fine spot , ' Jim said approvingly , but Skimmerhorn delayed decision , for as the sun set he caught a glimpse of something farther east that attracted him . Before dawn he was in the saddle , and as the sun came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranch  --  ap507hillside covered with piiion trees and marked by wind-eroded pinnacles that looked like gnomes marching from the pages of a German fairy tale . On a southern exposure , protected from the wind and overlooking an infinite expanse of prairie , Skimmerhorn located his camp . All the cowboys 'll be wanting duty up here , ' he predicted . But not because it 's beautiful . ' As he spoke , the whistle from a train on the UnionPacific sounded to the north , and he laughed . When we build this camp , Jim , we 'll have hell keeping the men out of Cheyenne , ' and that night when they spread their sleeping bags Jim could see in the west the lights of that hell-raising railhead city . They left the piiions and rode toward Rattlesnake Buttes , west of which they located Line Camp Three . It would be a favorite of those cowboys , for here they could scale the red buttes and generally enjoy themselves in one of the rugged areas of the west . But it was on the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense prairies could be controlled , that Jim caught once more that feeling of Colorado 's dormant grandeur . He had first experiencedthis sensation on the morning after the fight with the Kansas outlaws , when the immensity of the prairie exploded before him . Then the emptiness was a new sensation ; now it was home . And as soon as he rode east and reached those limitless horizons , with not a tree or a trail in sight , he sensed that he had found his universe , and said , Mr. Skimmerhorn , when you give the men their jobs , I 'd like to work out here . " Skimmerhorn laughed . You like this ? ' This is good country , ' Jim said . They located Line Camp Two about halfway to the Nebraska line , and Line Camp One at the mouth of a canyon in an area so bleak and forbiddingthat only someone like Jim could appreciate it . We 'll put our strongest cattle out here and let them fend for themselves , ' he suggested , but Skimmerhorn , kneeling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No , this grass is so rich it 'll do wonders for our weakest cattle . As soon as we get back to headquarters , Jim , I want you to ride into Denver and file for a homestead on this site . Mark off your boundaries now . And Jim did , using piles of stones to approximate the corners of the hundred-and-sixty-acre plot to which he could gain title if he successfullylied about his age . A considerable joy welled up as he placed the final corner . This is to be my land ! ' he cried , and Mr. Skimmerhorn said , Not exactly . You homestead it , but when the patent comes through , you sell to the ranch . ' I do n't want the money ! ' Jim protested . I want this canyon . ' The rule is , ' Skimmerhorn explained , with some coughing , that our cowboys file on the critical homesteads , then deed them back to the company . ' I 've always wanted my own land , ' Jim said stubbornly.  |p508So  have I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted from one place to another . . You have yours . ' Half an acre , ' Skimmerhorn said contemptuously . I wanted land like this . ' And he swept his right arm through a far reach , then dropped it . Fellows like you and me , Jim , we 'll get our land by managing it for others . ' They rode home by following the Platte , and for the first time Jim came to appreciate this extraordinary river . In some places it reminded him of the Pecos , and he told Skimmerhorn , Old Rags could jump this , ' but at other times he saw its power and its tattered magnificence . Just as you think you see it , ' he said , it changes completely . It must be the only river in the world that 's more islands than water . ' On one of the islands Jim found the bird which , even more than the soaring hawk , would epitomize for him this strange new land . It was a frail thing , walking delicately through marshes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touches of yellow and brown and flecked gray , but what distinguished it was its remarkable bill , a long thing which turned up sharply at the end . Jim had never seen a bird like this and he laughed with pleasure as it tiptoed along the shore of the river , dipping its curved beak into wormholes . What is it ? ' he asked . Avocet . ' Never heard of it . ' It patrols the river , ' Skimmerhorn said , and they watched the antics of the bird until night fell . One morning Jim rose early and looked west to the mountains , and the day was so unsullied that they could see the Rockies from a distance which Skimmerhorn calculated to be a hundred and fifty miles . That 's what 's good about this territory , ' Skimmerhorn said . You do n't find air like this in St. Louis . ' So Jim Lloyd returned to Zendt 's Farm and homesteaded his quarter section at the mouth of the canyon where Line Camp One was to be , but when he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper work to acquire other choice sites , and he asked them , You takin ' out the land for the ranch ? ' and the men whispered , Ssssh ! Do n't let anyone hear you say that . It 's illegal . ' Jim knew the whole arrangement was illegal , but like the others , he needed the job . From the moment of his arrival in Colorado , Oliver Seccombe had worked fifteen and eighteen hours a day , piecing together a ranch whose Crown Vee brand would be respected throughout the west . During the six months that Skimmerhorn had been absent , Seccombe had assembledthe crucial holcings , and now , with a relatively small outlay of British capital , he had his empire consolidated.  |p509It  had required a good many more than the seventeen sites he had confidently assumed would do the trick , and it had taken more money than he had anticipated to buy up abandoned holdings , but his cowboys had homesteaded some of the choicest sites for him , and there was that stroke of luck in Elmwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy some good British bulls , Shorthorns and Angus , and had persuaded two of the farmers to come west with their animals , bringing them by railroad as far as Cheyenne . While they were in the area , he conceived the idea of asking them to homestead two quarter sections for him . They saw no harm in this and agreed to sell him the homesteads once they were proved up . When they had signed the papers  --  they never saw the land they were acquiring  --  he had the further idea of proposing that as a gesture of good will to their friends and relatives in Elmwood , they get sixty or seventy of them to take the train trip west , at Seccombe 's expense , with each taking up a homestead for the benefit of the Venneford Ranch . The good people of Elmwood , eager to see the west , flocked out for a few days and then flocked right back home , but not before filing claims in Denver . In this unorthodox way Seccombe picked up an additional sixty-nine strategic holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there were a few farms along the Platte it still needed  --  and it stretched a hundred and fifty miles from east to west , fifty miles from north to south , for a total of 5,760,000 acres . But it should never be said that the Venneford Ranch owned so much land ; its actual holdings were rather modest : 17 parcels purchased outright 3,100 acres37 cowboy homesteads , beneficially controlled 5,920 acres69 Elmwood , Illinois homesteads , beneficially controlled 11,040 acresTotal ownership , real and beneficial 20,060 acresThis meant that of the open range referred to by the Venneford cowboys as our land , ' Seccombe and his absentee masters actually owned , by one device or another , less than one half of one percent . Nor was there any permanence to their control . Each railroad that entered the territory would gobble up its share of the range ; any town established in the area would eat up more ; homesteaders would nibble away at the edges . Each year the total would diminish , until by the end of the century the ranch would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million acres . Seccombe was right when he said , We 're borrowing the land . ' Who owned this borrowed land ? It belonged to the United States government , and until it was claimed by some adventurous homesteader , it was free for anyone to use . Even in this year of 1873 when the VennefordRanch was operating at maximum efficiency , if you came out fromp510Iowa and announced that you intended to run two thousand head of longhorns on their open range , you were absolutely free to do so , with two if 's . If you could get your cattle to water along one of the creeks , which would prove impossible , since all the good watering spots Were preemptedby the Venneford people . And if you could escape being shot . No one ever knew who did the shooting ; certainly it was not Mr. Seccombe , and for sure , not Mr. Skimmerhorn , who raised hell with Seccombe about the things that were going on . What happened was that when you brought your cattle onto the grazinglands , a Venneford cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering rights , and if you persisted in claiming your rights to the open land , one day you became shot . That was the phrase they used : Poor Waddington . Running his cattle north toward Skunk Hollow . He became shot . ' In eleven such incidents no one ever saw who did the shooting , nor were there even suspicions . But eleven would-be intruders became shot . Take the case of the two ranches along the Platte east of Zendt 's Farm . Close in was the farm belonging to Potato Brumbaugh , his wife , their daughter and two sons . Farther east , and therefore less protected , lay the ranch of Otto Kraenzel . Each commanded an influential stretch of riverbank , and if either fell into the hands of uncongenial cattlemen , the whole open range might become vulnerable . It was therefore essential that the Venneford people obtain these two ranches . Realizing that Hans Brumbaugh , with his successful irrigation project , would be the more difficult to persuade , Oliver Seccombe first approachedthe Kraenzels . They did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright future . Seccombe pointed out that if they sold to him at a good price , they could take the money and homestead elsewhere in Colorado ; he would help them locate a favorable site . They refused to discuss the matter , told Seccombe it was no use arguingany further , regardless of price . So he bade them an amiable farewell and caught the train at Cheyenne for business in Chicago . In his absence a Mr. Farwell arrived in Cheyenne . First he rode down to visit the Kraenzels , offering them a very good deal indeed , and then he rode up to the Brumbaugh ranch , where Hans and his wife assured him that under no conditions would they be interested in selling . Mr. Farwell came back with two assistants , whom he called Gus and Harry , and the trio did their best to convince both Kraenzel and Brumbaughto sell , but neither was interested . During the last discussion Mr. Farwell , a dck man in his forties who spoke with a gentle voice , said , I 'm sorry that negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Brumbaugh said . Mr. Farwell ignored this and said , I 'll wait for two days at Zendt 's place . If you change your mind , come in and we 'll settle this easily . '  |p511There  's nothing to settle , ' Brumbaugh said , and Kraenzel said the same . Then I suppose that 's all there is to it , ' Mr. Farwell said quietly . He indicated that Gus and Harry were to depart and he shook hands with the stubborn ranchers . For two days he waited at Zendt 's , and when nothing happened he rode off toward Cheyenne , with Gus and Harry trailing behind . Two nights later Otto Kraenzel was gunned down and his ranch house set on fire . Mrs. Kraenzel and the two children escaped . They were so terrified , so eager to be rid of this dreadful place , that when they got to Denver they authorized a lawyer to sell the establishment , cattle and all , if a buyer could be found , and they were seen no more in the west . OliverSeccombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Denver commissioninga lawyer he knew to acquire the vacated Kraenzel ranch , which solidified the Venneford holdings along the river . When news of Kraenzel 's murder sped through the community , the killers must have expected Potato Brumbaugh to hightail it off the Platte ; if so , they underestimated the stoop-shouldered Russian , for having once fought off the Volga Cossacks , he now had no intention of surrendering either to fear or to Mr. Farwell , wherever he was . Instead , he sent his daughter to town with a message for Levi Zendt : If they kill me , you 'll be next , ' and Levi suspected that this might be correct , but the request placed him in an awkward position . Brumbaugh was accusing the Vennefordpeople of trying to assassinate him and his family , and Levi was a partner in the Venneford operation . It was he , Levi , who was being accused of murder . He sent the Brumbaugh girl back to the farm and sought out Skimmerhorn . John , did you hire outsiders to come in here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He spoke with such conviction that Levi had to believe him . Did Oliver Seccombe hire anybody ? ' No , Levi ! He wants to round out his holdings , but not with bullets . ' Then our duty is clear . Somebody in the operation is trying to run Brumbaugh off his land . I 'm getting my guns to help him defend it . ' Without awaiting an answer , he turned and left , a stubborn , smallish man fifty-three years old , but at the gate he did hesitate , as if he expected a response , and John Skimmerhorn called , Wait . I 'll go with you . ' The enemy , whoever they were , struck that night , but they were met by such a hail of bullets from the Brumbaugh house  --  seven guns firing from all sides  --  that they failed to set any buildings on fire and killed no one , even though numerous bullets ripped through the house . The next night this ugly , unidentified war resumed , but toward dawn Potato Brumbaugh had had enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and said , They 're over behind that hayrick . There'sp512five of us to go out and get ' em , and these two friends to guard the house . ' I 'm goin ' with you , ' Levi said , but Brumbaugh would not allow it . Light was just beginning to break when they ventured forth  --  a husband , his sharpshooter wife , his daughter , aged thirteen , and his boys , twelve and ten , all wielding big guns , all determined to drive the enemy off or die . It was a brutal six minutes , with gunfire coming from many directions , but after the Brumbaughs worked their way safely across the open space leading to the barn , Potato surprised everyone . Running forward under protecting gunfire from his sons , he set fire to the hayrick , and as flames rose he bellowed , Over there , goddamnit , over there ! ' And his wife and daughter ran speedily to a vantage point and killed a man as he tried to escape the flames . The others rode off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead body , expecting to find Farwell or Gus or Harry , but the corpse was not of anyone previously seen in the area . When Oliver Seccombe returned from Chicago he was met by Zendt and Skimmerhorn , who told him , Outlaws killed Otto Kraenzel and drove his family off the land , ' and Seccombe said sanctimoniously , Yes , I heard of that sad affair . ' Next night they started on Potato Brumbaugh 's place , ' Skimmerhorn said , but Levi and I helped the family . They killed one of the outlaws and drove the others away . ' Levi was staring directly into Seccombe 's face as these words were said , and the man never flinched . Seccombe placed his arm about Skimmerhorn 's shoulder and said , You did exactly right , John . Ranches around here must be protected from nightriders . ' He then rode down to offer the Brumbaugh family the assistance of three ranch carpenters to help repair the damage , and Brumbaugh said , I 'd be glad to have them , ' and within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the Brumbaughs frequently , bringing the children presents from Cheyenne , and after a while it occurred to Brumbaughthat he was spying on his irrigation , so he switched his canvas dams and outlets to other places so as to confuse the Englishman . One day when he caught Seccombe surveying the hayricks he said , That 's to feed cattle when the winters get cold , ' and Seccombe said , Last winter I hardly wore a coat , ' and Brumbaugh said blandly , With all your cattle , you better hope it stays that way . ' Later he saw Seccombe instructing his cowboys how to dig irrigation ditches , and by one device or another he let Seccombe know that he was no longer welcome to visit the Brumbaugh farm . ' I ' 11 keep my ideas to myself , ' he told his wife , and let Oliver Seccombe do the same . ' In this way the traditional antagonism of the prairies was launched : the rancher who wanted the range kept open against the farmer whop513required fenced land which he could control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human family : And Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground . . . and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him . ' Levi Zendt , watching the growing friction , told his wife , Like always , the Bible was right . In a fight for land , the farmer will always kill off the rancher , because the farmer 's tied to the land and he 'll fight to protectit . ' During the early summer of 1873 three hunts were organized , and when they ended , the face of the west was permanently altered and any hope of retaining old patterns of life vanished . The first started in Omaha , Nebraska , and came at a dramatic time , for the Panic of 1873 had already cast its shadow across the money markets of New York and Chicago ; prudent men were beginning to draw in their investments , but the men and women involved in this outlandish affair were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch them . Leader of the hunt was one of the lesser dukes from Austria . He was accompanied by a grand duke from Russia . They were joined by French and English military attaches and by seven generals who had served with more or less distinction in the Union armies during the Civil War , among them a charismatic firebrand named George Armstrong Custer , a temporarygeneral during the Civil War but now returned to the rank of captain . Seconded to serve Custer was young Pasquinel Mercy , a lieutenantfrom Fort Laramie , who knew where to find buffalo . In the second echelon of the party , below the dukes and the generals but providing most of the money to pay for the special train , the servants , the boxcars of liquor and the twelve cooks to prepare the banquets , came a group of French and British financiers interested in the west , and among them was a member of the Venneford enterprises sent out to inspect the holdings of the noble earl in the American west . He was Henry Buckland , fifty-one years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol , and traveling with him was his daughter Charlotte , aged twenty-one . Buckland was a handsome , florid man of substance , both bodily and financially . He had left home as a young man to work aboard an Indiaboundship and had loved the subcontinent , finding himself more at home in Bombay than in Bristol . He had built for himself an impeccable businessreputation . He had married the daughter of a cousin of Earl Vennefordof Wye , and this happy union , somewhat above his station , had projected him into the front ranks of Bristol society . It was natural , when Venneford launched his adventures in America , that Henry Buckland be invited to participate , and it was equally naturalp514that he should be the first British member of the combine to visit the American establishment . His being along on the formal hunt was an accident . The organizers , hoping to snag a titled Englishman to augment the Austrian and Russian luminaries , had invited Lord Venneford , on the not preposterous theory that an English earl was at least the equal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties at home ; instead , he recommendedhis trusted associate , Henry Buckland of Bristol . Charlotte Buckland 's presence was not an accident . A headstrong , unpredictable girl of more than average beauty , she had during the past few years become increasingly troublesome to her parents . When she was nineteen  --  an age when her mother was already married  --  they had tried to arrange a most acceptable engagement to one of Bristol 's more promising young men , a member of the Pollard family notable for the excellent teas it imported from Ceylon and India . The match was totally appropriate , for it would have linked two families which had distinguishedthemselves in the India trade , and it had the warm approval of Lord Venneford . But Charlotte simply did not like young Pollard and abused him shamefully , letting it be known throughout Bristol that under no circumstanceswould she consent to marry him . And after casting him aside , she began flirting with a variety of men , including a naval officer and a married barrister , and her behavior was creating something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed from Bristol , and the unexpected invitation to her father to join the Omaha hunt could not have come at a more opportune time . I 'd love to go , Papa , ' she cried , emphasizing the word love , which she pronounced lovv , with that musical force that well-trained English girls often used . Indeed , she sang her sentences , and in so charming a way that she sometimes seemed a delicate bird infected with spring . She was tall and blond , and laughed easily . She had proved to her own satisfaction that she could entice men , and she liked their company . She left England in the spring of 1873 with a sense of keen excitement , as if in the new world she would find a fulfillment which she had missed in the old . She had no desire . whatever to visit India , that dreadfulplace filled with cobras and fat rajahs . ' She believed that India should be reserved for the capable young men of her family who understood trading in silk . Longhorn cattle ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early photograph of some two dozen steers on her father 's ranch  --  well , he owned a goodly share of it , even it it was in old Venneford 's name  --  and from the first had been fascinated by those incredible horns , jutting out at right angles to the animal 's face and reaching for seven feet , with a double twist on the way . I should love those animals , ' she assured her father . Also , the distances involved on the ranch intrigued her . She fig/ured that if one end of the ranch were placed on Bristol , the other would reach right across England to Dover and ten miles into the English Channel , and to have so much land under one management seemed quite preposterous . New York delighted her , with its plebeian vigor , and Chicago was a joy . She visited the burgeoning stockyards and for the first time saw her family 's beef on the hoof , but the horns of those steers were decidedly disappointing . They 're so dreadfully short , ' she complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herefords . ' She had often been to Herefordshire , the county that bordered Wales to the north , and knew the handsome red-and-white cattle that formed the specialty of that area . It was the trip west from Chicago that gave Charlotte her introduction to what she called the real America , ' and by the time she reached Omaha and the beginning of the Union Pacific she was in love with the sprawling land that seemed to encompass so many of her attitudes . It was bold , and innovative , and unafraid and often given to excess . She liked the men  --  those ruddy , well-fed merchants talking in hushed whispersabout the panic . They were disturbed by it , but not afraid . She liked the hearty voices , the lack of affectation and the open manner in which the men ogled her . By the time the train reached Nebraska she and her father had been invited as house guests to four different establishments , and she wanted to visit each . At Omaha the Bucklands were submerged in a sea of undirected activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , and junior members were making outrageous demands : The grand duke simply must have a bath twice a day , and the water must be hot , do you hear , hot ! ' There was also the matter of special foods and cooks to preparethem . The seven American generals had their problems , too , but each had a bevy of subalterns to solve them , while French and English businessmen encountered much difficulty in acquiring even basic necessities . The confusion was compounded by the four ubiquitous American journalists who wanted to talk with everyone , two photographers who were laboriously taking pictures which would be treasured a hundred years hence , and a German watercolorist who made lifelike pictures of the melange . He dashed them off with bewildering facility , seven and eight a day ; in time they would be worth five thousand dollars each , but now he handed the less appealing ones around as souvenirs , keeping only the best for the book that a German publisher had commissioned . This was the American west , the land of Indians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it as an escape from the routine of their city-pent lives . No detail was lacking in interest , and when Charlotte Buckland saw on the streets of Omaha a cowboy , a Chinese railway worker and a Pawnee Indian , she brought all three into line and had her photograph taken with them . ( There she is , standing between the Chinese and the Indian , a slim ,  |p516beautiful  English girl with a mischievous look that can be seen even now as she flirts with the cowboy . She wears a long dress , a summer blouse with ruffled sleeves , a large hat , and about her trim waist a heavy leather belt . Off to one side in the picture , photographed by accident , stands Lieutenant Pasquinel Mercy , whom she has not yet met . ) I am Lieutenant Mercy , ' a young man said , stepping forward . I have been commissioned to watch after you . ' She left the Indian and the Chinese and went over to Mercy , extending her hand . I 'm Charlotte Buckland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy an extra trunk from that horrid little man . ' They went to where Buckland was arguing , and within a few moments Lieutenant Mercy had the purchase arranged . He then took them on a brief tour of the station and showed them the train on which they would soon be embarking . As he did so , a well-worn little engine with a beehive stack puffed into the station , and Charlotte cried , Look at that darling little thing ! Is it going to pull us all the way to Wyoming ? ' And Mercy , with obvious pride , pointed to a black monster coming down another track and said , That 's ours . ' Papa ! ' Charlotte cried . Look at that giant beetle coming to consume us . ' The way she pronounced the word consume captivated Mercy , and he said , If it is a beetle , it must have wings , ' but his metaphor was awkward , and Buckland stared at him , but Charlotte , appreciating what the young officer had been attempting , cried , It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly to Wyoming . ' As she said this she pirouetted through the station , coming back to her father and grasping him by both hands . I shall never leave here , Papa . I feel it . I shall fly with my black beetle , and I shall be gone . ' It was nearly dusk when the amazing entourage finally packed itself aboard the special train and the new black engine pulled the seventeen cars westward . What a dinner was served that first night  --  from oysters to iced creams ! The two dukes were graceful in acknowledging the applauseof people lining the tracks and frequently they halted the train , dragging this or that Civil War hero to the back platform with them as torchlights began to flare in the countryside . Charlotte was flirting easily with Lieutenant Mercy , who seemed a most congenial young man , and brave too , with his stories of fighting Indians , when she became aware that a stranger was standing at her elbow , a*aiting an opportunity to speak with her . It pleased her to make believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mercy with unusual animation , singing her sentences joyously , then halting abruptly , looking up at the stranger and saying , I am most awfully sorry . Did you wish to speak to Lieutenant Mercy ? ' I wished to speak with you , Miss Buckland , ' the man said . My name 's Oliver Seccombe and I am general manager of Venneford Ranch . I 've come to take you to the Platte. '  |p517She  did not know the word . Is that the town where the ranch is ? ' It 's a river , ' he said . What a flat , ugly name for a river . Platte . Sounds as if somebody dropped a plate in a dishpan . ' Seccombe smiled . The name 's appropriate , for it is a flat , ugly river , is n't it , Lieutenant Mercy ? ' Not at Fort Laramie , ' Mercy said . Up there it 's rather fine . ' The ranch does n't extend to the fort , ' Seccombe explained . Charlotte , not entirely liking his manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find my father over there , with the Russian duke , ' she said . I 've spoken to Mr. Buckland , ' Seccombe said quietly . He was fiftyfiveyears old that summer , a lean , capable Englishman who had bowed and bent and sprung back in all the storms America could throw at him , and he did not intend to allow this ill-mannered daughter of a Bristol silk merchant to confuse him now . If you need me , ' he said softly , I shall be happy to assist you . For the present , you seem to be well cared for , and I shall go to bed . Busy day tomorrow . ' The long ride across Nebraska required two days , what with stopping to inspect items of interest and a long wait while the horses were unloadedso that the two dukes could caper across the prairies , with Pawnee scouts shouting like Indian warriors as they rode . Seccombe thought the Pawnee looked silly , undignified , but the dukes apparently loved it , so on the second day a mock battle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The riding was superb , and as planned , after a sharp encounter the soldiers sent the Indians scampering across the prairie . When they rejoined the train the Pawnee were laughing , destroying any illusion that the fray could have been serious , but General Custer , as he insisted upon calling himself , quickly corrected that . A thin man with flowing mustaches , he told the dukes of his feat in 1868 , only five years ago , at Washita River in Kansas . It was touch and go , ' he said , drawing the battle lines on paper , but in the end my cavalry swept around this point and taught the red men a lesson . ' How many did you kill ? ' one of the dukes asked . Two hundred , three hundred . ' A stirring victory ! ' the Russian duke cried , and he asked his aides if they did not agree that this was indeed a stirring victory . They did . Then Custer said modestly , These plains will never be safe until the red devils are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dukes nodded solemnly . A newspaperman overhearing the conversation winced . He knew that Custer had reported that he had slain 103 fierce warriors , whereas the official investigation , held later that year , had shown the Indian dead to number thirteen men , sixteen women and nine children . On the third day  --  after the train passed Julesburg and was well into Wyoming , skirting the Venneford Ranch , which touched the tracks onp518the south  --  the unbelievable happened . It could never have been planned , and it was no part of the arrangements or even the hopes of the seven generals , for their intention was to disembark at Cheyenne , ride north on horseback to Fort Laramie and hunt the buffalo from there . But as the train puffed westward , a remnant of the last herd to occupy the land between the two Plattes stumbled its way along the railroad tracks , and the engineer , blowing his whistle loudly all the while slowed down almost to a standstill as the train cut a path through the middle of the herd . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for six years now , started to mill around and in the end wound up within touching distance from the train windows . This was simply too good a chance to miss ! The dukes unlimbered their rifles . The generals got down their Winchesters . Even Charlotte Buckland was offered a heavy Civil War gun , which she refused . It was almost impossible to miss a buffalo . Indeed , at some points it was necessary to wait for him to move off a few feet so that one could aim at a vital organ ; otherwise the gun went off with the muzzle caught in the hair , which merely blew a hole in the beast 's stomach without really finishing him off . The firing continued for nearly half an hour , with animals dropping on either side of the train , depending upon which windows were crowded with sportsmen , and in this manner some sixty or seventy buffalo were slain . There was a brief interlude of excited chatter as they all compared notes on their kills . Suddenly someone noticed , moving parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held low , great shoulders and a sloping rear well adapted to fast charges . He could hardly have been important in the servicing of cows , for surely younger bulls must have driven him away by now , but he had a notable dignity which the German watercolorist tried to catch . What an animal ! ' he cried as he rapidly started to sketch the sloping shoulders and drooping head . Charlotte could not remember later who uttered the cry , but someone shouted , It 's for Miss Charlotte , ' and a special gun , an Austrian one with a powerful sight , was handed to her , but again she refused . Please ! ' the Austrian duke cried . You may never have another chance .. She does n't want it , ' a quiet voice said , and Charlotte saw with relief that it was , Oliver Seccombe . He took the heavy gun and handed it to one of the Russians . I 'll take him ! ' the Russian duke bellowed , but the pace of the bull matched exactly the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grizzled old veteran moved beside the window , close enough to be touched but too close for a sporting shot . Have the engineer speed up ! ' the Russian roared , and an equerry ran forward to deliver the message , but it was not required , for now the oldp519bull started to veer away and the men standing behind the grand duke cheered and an American general shouted Now ! ' But at that moment someone bumped the Russian , so that his bullet did not strike a vital organ ; it may even have ricocheted off the horn , for the old bull snorted , kicked his hind legs and galloped off toward the open prairie . Do n't let him escape ! ' one of the generals cried , and nineteen guns blazed from the slowly moving train . The old bull quivered , tried to maintain his balance but collapsed in the dirt . He had been running with such force that his body scraped along the ground for fifteen feet , raising a pillar of dust . The best bull of all , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for last . ' Seventy-three buffalo had been shot , a perfectly splendid accounting , all agreed . By this time the train , now unimpeded , started speeding up  --  leaving behind to rot some fifty tons of choice meat , along with hides that could have been fashioned into seventy-three of the finest robes . The portrait of the old bull was never finished . The German watercolorist , watching the noble beast go down under the blizzard of bullets , had no stomach for depicting his death . He crumpled the paper , and cleaning women at Cheyenne found it on the floor with the other rubbish . The second hunt occurred in response to national policy . It started in April of that year , in the town of Jacksboro , Texas , where in the handsome public square a man named Harker appeared leading three stout wagons and a group of four extremely tough skinners . When his convoy halted he let it be known that he would consider signing up one buffalo hunter , if the man was unusually good with the rifle . Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and after he heard this four times he said , I better see Calendar , ' and he went in search of him . He found him on the north edge of town , living alone in a miserable shack . Calendar was then twenty-five years old , an extremely thin , cleanshavenrecluse without even a dog to keep him company . His only possessions seemed to be the clothes he wore and two fine rifles invented by Christian Sharps and now manufactured in Hartford , Connecticut . Name 's Harker , ' the buffalo hunter said . Mine 's Calendar . ' Hear you been up the trail to Colorado . ' Twicet . ' See any buffalo ? ' Millions . ' How long ago ? ' Five years . ' Aha ! ' Harker cried . I 'm the man who knows where they are now . ' Meanin ' what ? '  |p520They  tell me you can shoot . ' That 's right . ' Care to prove it ? ' Calendar showed no desire to demonstrate a known fact , so he remainedinside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his oldest Sharps , the one he had carried on the Colorado trail . With studied insolence he took out a paper cartridge , hefted it for weight , pulled down the lever on his rifle and inserted the cartridge so that a tail of paper extended backward from the chamber . Then , with a sudden upward flick of the lever , he closed the breech in such a manner that a sharp knife sheared off the loose end of paper , exposing in the chambera heavy charge of black powder , ready to be ignited whenever a spark was thrown upon it . I see you 're usin ' the old-style cartridge , ' Harker said with an edge of contempt . Because I like ' em , ' Calendar replied defiantly . He opened a minute chamber into which he placed a fulminate of mercury primer , which , when the hammer exploded it , would send a flash of fire down a tube to discharge the exposed powder . It was as complicated a system as had ever been devised for a rifle , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worked . What are you goin ' to hit ? ' Harker asked . Anything you say . ' Harker looked about for a bottle , found one and walked a considerabledistance before placing it against a tree . Try that , ' he called . Calendar raised his Sharps , felt it nestle against his shoulder , and experienced not the slightest doubt that he would strike the bottle , for he had molded the bullet at the end of the paper cartridge ; he had tied the banknote paper to the bullet with silk thread ; he had weighed preciselythe amount of powder ; and he knew to a fraction how each part of the gun would act . I ' 11 shoot off the top , ' he said . Carefully , yet with familiar ease , he steadied the gun , pulled back the rear trigger to move the sear into hairtriggerposition and moved his finger to the forward trigger . With ever so slight a touch he depressed the forward trigger , and several remarkable things happened . Because the powder lay exposed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dangerous body of flame shot upward through the loose fittings , temporarily blinding the shooter . Also , because the breech was loose-fitted in another direction , a fair supply of powder backfired into the face of the operator . But most important , the Sharps was so well made , and with such a heavy barrel , that the bullet had to leave the muzzle at great speed and with perfect direction . If Calendar aimed right , the bullet went right.  |p521Smack  ! There was no crash of broken glass , just the crisp sound of the top being blown off . You can shoot , ' Harker said as he returned to the shack . You want to work for me on a buffalo hunt . . . a real buffalohunt ? ' Well . . . ' Calendar said . He had no need of work . Doing odds and ends around Jacksboro , he made enough to keep alive , for his wants were few . He did n't drink . He had no woman . He did n't have to plow , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for his guns ; he did n't even need to buy cartridges , since he made his own . But Harker had a persuasion that Calendar could not resist . See that thing sticking out of my saddlebag ? That 's a new Sharps . Brass car-tridge . ' It is ? ' Calendar asked , unable to mask his surprise . He had heard of this mighty gun , .50 caliber , 70 grains of powder , 475 grains of lead in the bullet . It was supposed to be a monster and only a few test samples had so far been made . How 'd you get aholt of one ? ' Calendar asked , studying the weapon as it rested in the saddlebag . Friend bought it for me . You come out with me , Calendar , that rifle 's yours . Go ahead , take it out . ' Once Calendar had the black-steel rifle in his hands , once he had inspected that enormous barrel  --  thirty-five inches long , twenty-three pounds in weight  --  he was lost . You 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man could n't hold this . ' We 've got a tripod , ' Harker said . And we 've got the cartridges . ' He handed Calendar three beautiful brass tubes . No more dangerous paper cartridges , no more flash from loose powder , no more backfire into the face . And then Harker , like Mephistopholes , whispered the magic words that made resistance impossible . Handing Calendar an intricate tool on which he had been working , he said softly , At night , when the hunting'sdone for that day , you 'll sit around filling your own brass cartridges . . . molding the lead bullets . . . fitting them in place . ' Calendar studied the improvised tool : one hook removed the primer from the head of the spent cartridge , another plunger seated the new primer ; a clever device straightened the cartridge ; another crimped the edge to fasten the end of the bullet ; at the far end there was a bullet mold into which hot lead would be poured ; on the side was attached a powder measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with three or four dozen cartridges to be reloaded , a bar of lead for casting bullets and a can of black powder , a man could shoot his way from here to hell . How much is the gun ? ' Calendar asked , his eyes dancing . Nothing . You shoot for me all summer . . . I got four of the best skinners you ever seen . You keep ' em busy , and at the end of the season that gun 's yours . '  |p522I  do n't go out with no man 's gun but my own , ' Calendar said . How much ? ' Forty-nine dollars , and the double trigger , four dollars more . ' Would n't be no good without a double trigger . ' He looked at the gun , studied Harker , who seemed remarkably unpleasant . I got fiftythreedollars , mister . I 'm buyin ' the gun , and I 'm leavin ' with you this afternoon . ' So off they went to hunt buffalo  --  Bill Harker , as tough a plainsman as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with R. J. Poteet ; four ugly , dirty skinners ; two wagon men to haul the skins ; and a cook . They left Jacksboro about dusk and made camp well outside of town . Heading in a northwest direction , they crossed the Trinity River , the Wichita , the Peace and the Red , which put them into Oklahoma Indian territory , where they had no right to be . Harker warned them , ' Keep a sharp eye for Comanche , ' and a night guard was posted . God help the Indian who stumbled into this camp , because these men were killers . They hated Indians , sheriffs , missionaries , schoolteachers , buffalo , deer , antelope and other things yet to be identified . On their third day in Oklahoma they sprang into action , for Harker was right . With some innate sense he knew where the buffalo were , and he led his deadly team right to the edge of a herd . From a slight rise they looked down on at least six hundred animals . We work this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best shot , so you edge your way downwind while I move in from this side . You shoot first and knock down whatever animal seems to be leading the pack , but do n't kill him . If we can knock down the leader , the rest will mill around inspectin ' him and we can pick ' em off at our speed . ' The big thing , as Harker explained , was to achieve a stand . That happened when the hunter succeeded in dropping but not killing the leader ; then he could remain in one spot and shoot at leisure , bagging as many as seventy or eighty beasts while they milled about their fallen leader , uncertain what to do or which way to go . There 's nothin ' in this world stupider than a buffalo , ' Harker whispered as they prepared to attack the herd . Wound one of them , the rest will gather round . I killed sixty-seven once , just like that . ' Calendar crept into position downwind of the herd and watched as the animals continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told himself , creeping ever closer . He was now within sixty yards of the stragglers , but he did not want them . It was his responsibility to knock down the leader . You aimed not for the heart , because even with two bullets through the heart , a buffalo bull could run a hundred yards , throwing the herd into panic . What you did was aim for the lungs , becausethen the bull fell to the ground in lingering and unfrenzied dying . Then the other buffalo would gather to watch in quiet confusion . Now Calendar was close to the leaders and he could discern whichp523of them had to be shot first . Looking back to where Harker waited with his own Sharps , Calendar signaled that he was about to begin . Methodically he cocked his rifle , inserted the brass cartridge and listened as the block moved snugly back into position . He set the trigger , adjusted the monstrous gun in its tripod and aimed at the lungs of the lead animal . Stroking the front trigger lightly , he heard a whoosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy push of a cannon . The bullet sped accurately and with tremendous force . Striking the lead buffalo in the side , it penetrated both lungs , and the bewildered animal dropped to the ground . The rest of the herd began their invariableritual of milling around , sniffing the fallen beast , then standing still as though waiting for a decision . During this time , which might last as long as forty minutes , the hunters had the herd at their mercy . A stand , it was called , and the trick was to pick off the waiting animals with a clean shot , lodged between the horn and the ear so as to produce immediatedeath , a swift sinking to the ground without even a muted bellow of pain . Despite the noise of the rifles , which somehow the buffalo never learned to heed , the animals remained unaware of danger . Working methodically , Harker and Calendar killed nineteen buffalo , reloading with care and shifting their tripods from time to time . But on the twentieth shot Harker had the bad luck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear leg and causing him to thrash about , dangling the useless leg and bellowing . This put the whole herd into a frenzy , and one cow , sensing the danger at last , started off at a gallop , taking the remaining animals with her . It was no use to shoot blindly at retreating buffalo ; cartridges must not be wasted . Now the skinners moved in , men skilled with knives . They worked in pairs , throwing the carcass on its back and slitting the belly from tail to throat . Ropes were attached to the skin , and horses pulled the heavy robes loose . The carcass , of course , was left to rot , but a good robe with the flesh cleaned off might bring as much as three dollars . Properly tanned , it could go as high as twelve . We nearly had ourselves a stand , ' Harker said that night as he and Calendar made up the cartridges for the next day . We would of had it , but I hit that damned bull in the leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musta been a light charge of powder , ' he surmised . Hell , in this business , anything can go wrong . We 're doin ' God 's work , you could say , ' he told the men . I heard General Phil Sheridan in Austin , and there 's no man knows the west like General Phil . And he said that the west will not be worth a damn till every buffalo is killed . Every one . ' What was his thinkin ' ? ' one of the skinners asked . Hell , it 's clear . We wipe out the buffalo , the Indian has got to go on the reservation , where he belongs . When they start to starve , what choice do they have but to obey ? ' The buffalo men considered this for some time , and Harker explained ,  |p524When  you face an enemy they 's two things you can do . Kill him or starve him . The ministers and the newspaper people and them damnfools in Washington wo n't let us kill the Indians off , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffalo , like we 're doin ' , we can sure as hell starve ' em into submission . ' The slaughter continued  --  twenty-three . . . thirty . . . sixteen , and on one memorable day , fifty-seven , killed in two lots , one in the morning and another in the late afternoon when everyone thought the daywas finished . The line of carcasses alerted the Comanche to the fact that Texans had invaded their territory , and an assault was launched , with many Indians riding swiftly at the three wagons , but Harker had his men ready . He and Calendar , with their Sharps reloading in seconds , sat stolidly behind one of the wagons , resting their small cannon on the framework , and carefully picked off one Comanche after another . The same practical principle applied as in hunting buffalo : take it slow , pick off the leaders , throw the tribe into confusion . Whoosh ! While Harker reloaded , Calendar drew a sight on a young brave who was shouting orders , and he fell in a heap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  resolute gunners working professionally and bringing down the enemy . When nine bodies lay scattered through the sage , the Comanche withdrew . In previous forays they had often encountered stubborn resistance from white men , but never this quiet , deadly fire . We showed ' em ! ' Harker exulted that night . A few more days likethis and we 'll have this territory cleaned of buffalo and Indians both . ' They ought a give us a medal , ' one of the skinners said . General Sheridan suggested that , ' Harker said . I was talkin ' with him at his hotel and he told me , " Harker , they ought a cast gold medals for men like you . One side a buffalo , other side an Indian . You 're doin ' the work of civilization . " What he meant , as I heard later , was that when we get through , the plains 'll be a decent place for proper settlers . ' This observation was digested by the men , none of whom had much use for civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few comments he was to utter this summer : Proper settlers is sometimes more of a pain in the ass than Indians . . . or buffalo either . ' As he said these words he was looking at the open prairie to the west , and on the next day , when he was far ahead of the wagons , he came upon his big chance and he knew exactly what to do about it . He was in Colorado Territory , north of the Arkansas , when some sixth sense warned him that buffalo might be grazing ahead . Dismounting , he crept over the brow of the hill and saw below him several hundredlarge animals , one of the last major remnants of the southern herd . For a moment he considered riding back to alert Harker , for it wouldp525take two guns to handle this herd properly , but some movement among the animals to the north warned him that he had no time to spare . He therefore crept back over the hill to get his rifle and tripod and four dozen cartridges . Crawling slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location from which he could knock down the leader . Adjusting his tripod , he sat behind it , his thin legs spread like a V , his eye at gun level . Patiently , and without visible excitement , he dropped the lead animal with a shot through the lungs and watched as the others began to mill around . Blowing into the breech , he reloaded and killed the first of the standing buffalo . Time after time he fired with sober calculation , killing his buffalo with precision . On the twenty-sixth kill he uttered his only words : I think I got me a stand . ' It looked as if he could fire at the animals forever , but there was a limitation and he knew it . If he fired any faster than once every forty seconds , the barrel of his rifle would accumulate so much heat it would expand , thick as it was , and it might not cool to its former accuracy . So he worked slowly , feeling the barrel after each shot . He wished to hell he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-nine , forty-three . The huge beasts fell in the dust and still the herd could not comprehend what was happening . Ca n't be nothin ' stupider than a buffalo , Calendar thought . They deserve to die . And then , as he fired his forty-sixth shot , help came . Harker , hearing from a distance the slow , rhythmic firing , guessed that Calendar might have himself a stand , and now he came creeping over the hill with a canteen of water and five dozen more bullets . When Calendar saw him he was so delighted that tears of gratitude almost came to his eyes . Jesus ! ' Harker whispered . Have you got yourself a stand ! ' He gave Calendar the water and watched as the hunter cooled off his rifle . When Calendar , in sign language , asked if Harker wanted to go back for his own rifle and join the kill , the boss shook his head . It 's your stand , ' he whispered . Let 's see what you can do . ' So Calendar , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , methodically shot a fifth dozen , then a sixth , then a seventh . Christ , you got eighty-five , eighty-six buffalo down there , ' Harker said . Eighty-four , ' Calendar said , watering the barrel on the outside , pouringsome down the inside and letting it flow through the open breech . Still the stupid buffalo made no move . Seven dozen of their mates lay dead and they were unable to adjust to that fact , because none of the dead had thrashed about or bellowed . Eighty-five , eighty-six , ' Harker counted . Take it easy , and you got your hundred . ' It was unlikely that the skinners could handle so many . The surplus would be left to rot with their hides on , but the gun was cool now and Calendar might as well try for a record . He killed two more of the bigp526animals , then gunned down a medium-sized cow , but on his ninetieth shot the cartridge must have been defective , for it struck far short of the herd , ricocheted and hit a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started to gallop . Before Calendar could fire again , the herd was gone , leaving eighty-nine dead . The third hunt can be reported briefly . In the late summer of 1873 those few Arapaho still trying to survive on the cramped remnants of the reservation at Rattlesnake Buttes ran so short of food that they faced actual starvation . The government said it wanted to help and even sent messages of commiseration , but the financial panic restricted funds in the east and no money could be spared to feed Indians . Chief Lost Eagle , now an old man of sixty-three with breaking teeth , made one last appeal , sending a delegation to Major Mercy in Denver , and the major rode out to the reservation and cursed the deprivation he saw , but he had neither the power nor the money to alleviate it . So it was decided by the younger braves to try one last buffalo hunt , even though this would take them from the reservation and across lands on which settlers had begun to appear . Lost Eagle was too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Red Wolf , and the remnants of the once-mighty Arapaho set forth . What a pitiful lot they were . Their horses were lank ; if buffalo were sighted , the horses would scarcely be able to keep up with them , let alone overtake and ride them down . The braves were in worse condition  --  emaciated , sullen men who could not comprehend what was happening to them . No white man in the path of these Indians had much to fear ; one rifle blast would scatter the lot . They went south , entering upon that land between the Platte and the Arkansas , and there they searched for buffalo . Each morning weary scouts rode to the four compass directions and saw much rolling land , all empty . Somewhere there had to be buffalo . They had heard reports of the train whose engineer had run into the middle of a herd . But they could find none . Two long weeks they spent in the saddle , chasing illusions and findingemptiness . They grew so weak from lack of food , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end they might have perished , actually starved to death on their prairie , had they not stumbled upon an area north of the Arkansas where the carcasses of eighty-nine buffalo lay rotting in the sun . The men were so famished that one actually ate some decayed meat , but Red Wolf saw the folly of this and spurred his horse so that he stood between his men and the meat . Holding his right hand aloft , he graduallydrove them back , and after a while the one who had eaten was gripped in dreadful pain , dying with foam on his lips , and the others acknowledged the wisdom of their chief.  |p527He  took no consolation . Astride his horse he looked down at the slaughter , nearly a hundred buffalo slain and not even the tongues removed . Some hunter had killed so many that his skinners could not keep up , and twenty of the animals were left to rot with their hides untouched . What kind of men are they ? ' Red Wolf cried in anguish . That they kill the food we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered the ultimate indignity , the mortal shame of the leader : to lead a people and be unable to feed them . It was at that moment that his evil luck changed . An outfit came over the hill at the Arkansas , trailing cattle up the Skimmerhorn Trail to Wyoming , and the trail boss took pity on the starving Indians and gave them two old steers . Red Wolf allowed his braves to slaughter one of the longhorns , then exercised severe discipline as he made his ravenous braves save one to drive back for the women on the reservation . Revitalized by this accidentalfood , the hunters scoured the prairie , convinced they must encounterbuffalo , but none were to be found ; between the Platte and the Arkansas , there were no more buffalo . Red Wolf , sitting beside his horse on the last night of the hunt , told his men , The old days have passed . We shall hunt no more forever . ' The younger men asked what they would do instead , and Red Wolf said , Through hunger the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must leave the buttes and go to some smaller reservation , as he directs . ' The young braves protested : This is our land . It was given to us for as long as the waters flow and the birds fly . ' The White Father wants it , and we must go . ' He never deviated from this harsh decision , and as soon as he returned to Rattlesnake Buttes , bringing back from the hunt the drying meat from one old Texas steer , he advised his father , Lost Eagle , now we must go , ' and that old chief fingered his Buchanan and agreed . They sent a messenger to Denver to inform Major Mercy that they were now prepared to surrender their lands forever , and he sent a telegramto Washington , and a commissioner was sent out who held long powwows , assuring the Arapaho they were making the right decision and that in their new home , far to the north in Dakota , there would be ample food and a secure home for as long as the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late summer the last group of Arapaho departed . They rode north on spavined horses , wrapped in tattered blankets . The gaily painted buffalo hides that recalled the history of their people were gone ; the garments of elk and porcupine quill were gone ; the young braves riding ahead to scout for buffalo were no more . The ancient ways were lost . As they reached the crest of the white hills which marked the northernborder of their truncated reservation , Chief Lost Eagle , wearing hisp528hat with the turkey feather , paused to look back upon the buttes and the Platte and the prairie , and there was no sadness in him : Often in the past Our People were forced to make a new life in a new land , and always we had the courage to succeed . We were here at the buttes less than six generations and now we move to something different . This time I do believe the White Father will keep his promises . In Dakota we shall grow strong again . ' He kicked his pony , and the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had protected so well . The Clarion could express no sorrow at their passing : Yesterday we went out to the buttes to witness the departure of Lo from our fair land . Good riddance . They left Colorado for the last time riding mangy ponies , most of them stolen , we feel sure , and wearing blankets which would have profited from a good washing . They were a miserable lot of flea-ridden , filthy , ignorant , disgusting animals , and our only regret at watching them go was that Colonel Frank Skimmerhorn could not have been here to see his prophecy fulfilled . We hear that on the other side of the mountain the Utes are kicking up trouble again . We warn them that if they stick their noses over this way , we will shoot them off . They 'll get far worse from us than they ever got from the Arapaho . Colorado will never merit statehood until we completethe job of exterminating these vermin . When Oliver Seccombe watched the Arapaho depart , he realized that this was the moment to appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicious acquisition of two key parcels of land , he secured the whole area for the Venneford Ranch . Ninetyninehundredths of the former Indian lands were actually public property , open to everyone , but Seccombe and his men made sure that no one could get to them . That summer of 1873 was to be an exciting one for Oliver Seccombe . Henry Buckland was proving himself to be a shrewd and sensible businessman , and he required little instruction before grasping the essentials of any operation . After a visit to one line camp , he put his finger on the permanent problem : Land , Seccombe ! We must own our own grazingland . . . have it secure in our possession . ' He was pleased with the devices Seccombe had used to acquire control of water , but even so , the total seemed inadequate . And then good fortune struck for the Englishmen . The Union Pacific Railroad volunteered to help them out . Back in 1862 , when the United States government had determined that a railroad was needed to bind the nation together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major undertaking . The nation was too poor to pay for the road out of tax funds , but there was an in/genious way to finance it . From the center of the main track , reaching out ten miles on each side , the government would give the railroad land , with no charge of any kind . This land in its original barren condition would be worth about twenty cents an acre , but with a prosperous railroadrunning through it , it might become worth as much as four dollars an acre . By selling this land to would-be settlers , the railroad would earn back more than the cost of building the road . The western range would be settled ; the nation would have a link to the Pacific ; towns would appear  --  and all at no expense to the taxpayer . It was one of the sagest devices ever invented by Congress . Furthermore , Congress added an adroit stipulation : the railroad would not receive all the land ten miles out from the track ; it would get only every other section , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus sharing in whatever increased values might accrue . It was a happy solution , made more palatable by the rule that two sections in each township must be set aside for public education . In later years , when the Union Pacific gleaned a fortune on the sale of land the government had given it , jaundiced critics would cry , with some justification , We gave our soul away to the railroad , ' but in 1862 there had been no viable alternative , and in the long run , little harm was done . It worked this way . Back in 1785 when the surveys of Ohio and Indianawere being conducted , it was provided that an American township be composed of thirty-six square miles , each called a section . They were numbered in a way which ensured that two sections with contiguous numbers would also have contiguous boundaries : 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 18 17 16 15 14 13 19 20 21 22 23 24 30 29 28 27 26 25 31 32 33 34 35 36The railroad received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government retaining the even-numbered , except for 16 and 36 , which the state could sell or lease to provide funds for area schools . Now , in 1873 , the railroad was preparing to sell off a number of its odd-numbered sections , all the way from Omaha to Utah , and Henry Buckland , during his visits in New York and Chicago , had laid the groundwork for a massive purchase of these sections . He had till the end of August to decide whether his Bristol confreres wished to acquire sixty running miles of land on the south side of the railroad track , a stretch reaching from Line Camp Two to Cheyenne . Since the land wasp530ten miles deep , six hundred square miles of range were involved . By purchasingonly the odd-numbered sections , 192,000 acres in all , the Vennefordpeople would acquire physical control of the even-numbered too , or nearly four hundred thousand secure acres . If the Bristol merchants could come up with the cash , the permanence of the cattle operation would be ensured for decades to come . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seccombe and Skimmerhorn . We have an empire within our grasp , ' he said . Let 's see if we can afford it . ' The three men went over the maps and figures until they had the data memorized , and consistently Skimmerhorn came back to one basic fact : If we have our water safe on the Platte , and we do , and can get hold of this land up north , we control everything in between . We have to have it , no matter the cost . ' Buckland was distressed by the fact that proffered land did not reach all the way east to Line Camp One . We 'd be unprotected on that end , ' he-complained , and Skimmerhorn introduced him to the facts . We 're unprotected there right now . We 're unprotected over by the mountains . Within a short time , Mr. Buckland , homesteaders will begin claiming those lands . We have only a few years more of open range . ' It 's our land ! ' Buckland protested . Only because we say so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it . ' But the time is coming , Mr. Buckland , when there wo n't be open range . When I went back to Indiana for that last load of bulls , a man named Jacob Haish showed me something he 'd invented . A fence . ' Cattle will go right through a fence , ' Buckland said . Not this fence , ' Skimmerhorn said , and onto the table he tossed a piece of crude barbed wire , not the sophisticated product that would soon burst onto the market , but a primitive affair , with deadly spikes . Farmers like Potato Brumbaugh will soon fence their lands with wire like this , ' Skimmerhorn predicted . And homesteaders on the Nebraska end will fence theirs .. And finally , we 'll have to fence ours , ' Buckland interrupted . If we own any , ' Seccombe said . We must own it , ' Buckland snapped . As much as we can . ' And then his two managers became aware of a fact that would dominatethe rest of their business lives . Venneford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skimmerhom . Lord Venneford had little say in it , nor did prosperous men like Henry Bucidand . It was run by a faceless clerk called Finlay Perkin , and until he gave permission for the American ranch to buy the railroad lands , they could not be bought . What 's he like ? ' Skimmerhom asked , as Buckland prepared the messagefor Perkin . He 's a Scotsman . '  |p531That  's all we need , ' Seccombe said . A Scotsman running an English ranch . ' They have a saying in Scotland , ' Buckland explained . If you have three sons , and one is especially brilliant and of good character , keep him in Edinburgh , for there the competition is fierce and he 'll need all the fiber he has . If your second son is brilliant , but lacking in character , send him to America , where anything goes . And if your third son has tremendous character but no brains , send him to England , where the lack will never be noticed . Finlay Perkin is a third son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England had become a fast link to home , and the three plotters took a good deal of time drafting their messageso that it would seem enticing to a clerk in Bristol : PERKIN VENNEFORDS BRISTOLOPPORTUNITY PURCHASE UNIONPACIFIC TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES FREEHOLD GIVING EXCLUSIVE CONTROL EQUAL AMOUNT GOVERNMENT LAND ONE DOLLAR TWENTYFIVE AN ACRE STOP SECCOMBE SKIMMERHORN CONCUR STOP AUTHORIZEBUCKLANDWithin a day Finlay Perkin answered . He said he had reason to believe that the railroad was not ready to sell now , but that an option could be had for ultimate sale at no more than sixty cents an acre . We ca n't offer them less than half ! ' Seccombe protested , but when he and Buckland went to Omaha with an ironclad proposal  --  option money delivered in New York within two days , total sum in escrow in an Omaha bank  --  the railroad signed at fifty-five cents an acre and seemed glad to be rid of the land . On the way back to the ranch Seccombe asked , How could Perkin , in Bristol , have known what American railroad men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows everything . ' Charlotte Buckland had accompanied her father to the negotiations in Omaha , and now as the train rolled westward , with fascinating people crowding the parlor cars , she felt more than ever that she belonged to this vibrant land where a man could buy two hundred thousand acres of land in an afternoon , and she began studying Oliver Seccombe with increasedinterest . He was a handsome man , about the same age as her father but infinitely more vital . He obviously needed a wife . He was older than she and would not live forever , but there were other parts of the world she had not yet explored , and she was prepared to make some of those futurejourneys as a widow , if necessary . Young Pasquinel Mercy had wooed her with some ardor , and shep532liked him , but he seemed much the same as the bright young men who filled the British army ; his tales of Wyoming were their stories of India , and both were boring . What excited her was not barracks life but the full swing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The names entranced her , and by the time her train reached the borders of Wyomingshe had convinced herself that ranch life in the west was what she wanted . Looking at her father , paunchy and dozing in the sun , satisfied her that the one thing she did not want was to return to Bristol . She therefore focused her attention on Oliver Seccombe , and before he was aware of what was happening , he was in love with her . They got off the train in Cheyenne , now a cleaned-up , booming young city with the whores out and the churches in . There , in the railroad hotel , they waited for the horses that would take them down to their inspection of Line Camp Four , and in the interval they explored Cheyenne , meeting numerous attractive Englishmen who had come to try their luck at ranching . One morning , with the air crisp and the sun radiant , she clasped Seccombe 's hand and cried ecstatically , Oh , Oliver , I do wish I could stay here forever , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . ' But he remained silent . There followed delightful days visiting with English ranchers and listening to their euphoric accountsof how they would make their millions . It 's fabulous , ' a young fellow named Tredinnick cried . Really , Charlotte , all you do is lead the cattle onto the land , and the bulls take care of the cows and the cows take care of the calves , and each year you ship the surplus off in a great goods train to Chicago and pocket the gold . It comes rolling in . ' Have you sent any shipments east ? ' Buckland asked . Not yet , but Harry over there has . ' They talked with Harry , a young man from Leeds , and he had shipped cattle east . At a simply staggering profit . This year , of course , what with the panic , prices wo n't be so fantastic . But you ca n't help making money , bundles of it . ' These enterprising Englishmen had not forced their way into Wyomingand Colorado ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop their own country . Foreign investment was essential if the west was to develop . So the British , with an excess of funds from trade with their great empire , were invited to do what Americans were incapable of doing , and Charlotte was constantly surprised at the imaginative way they applied their capital . She felt especiallyproud of Oliver Seccombe . But she supposed that he feared marrying a girl so much younger , and she began making clever and even bold observations to the effect that difference in age was not disqualifying . Once , as they inspected Freddy Tredinnick 's herd , she said quietly , I notice the good ranchers build their stock from young cows and proven bulls . ' As soon as she said this she blushed.  |p533I  'm not a proven bull , ' Seccombe parried . I 'm just an old one . ' She teased with him like this for several days , always thinking that he was holding back because of her age and never once detecting the real reason for his restraint . Erroneously she deduced that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she concluded that this was a problem which only she could resolve for him , so on their last night in the railroad hotel , after the Negro servants had closed the doors and overfed Henry Buckland had plodded off to bed , she said goodnight to Seccombe , and they went to their separate rooms . She prepared for bed , waited till the halls were quiet , then slipped along to Seccombe 's door , opening it gently . She stood so that she was silhouetted against the light burning in the hall . Hearing Seccombe gasp , she went to his bed and whispered , It 's not complicated , Oliver , not when you 're in love . ' Next day , on the ride down to Line Camp Four , Seccombe could not refrain from congratulating himself on his good luck in snaring a girl like Charlotte Buckland  --  wit , wealth , family association with the Vennefords , and above all , an affection for the west . When she saw the camp , with its piiion trees and eroded pillars , she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said wryly , We 're still in Wyoming . ' This unkind remark sprang from the deep apprehension he felt towardany permanent involvement with this attractive girl . She was wrong in assuming that he held back because of anxiety over their difference in ages . He knew that she thought he was forty-eight , three years younger than her father , when he was really fifty-five . But he also knew that his vitality was not impaired . When she contrived opportunities to be alone with him among the pinon trees or in the secrecy of the barn , and she managed several , their enjoyment of each other was complete . Nor was his affection for her passive . He loved the sound of her voice , her British manner of singing words and giving a lilt to her sentences , so refreshing after the years of flat American accents . When she said , as they were halting for a picnic , The curve of that hill reminds me of the strangest thing , the lovely terraces of Bristol , ' he would see again the noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . She reminded him of his Englishness , and whereas he had been contentin America , growing to respect its extraordinary diversity from Santa Fe to Oregon , he did remain English at heart , and it was good , in these later years of his life , to have that heritage refreshed . You 're slow in proposing , Oliver , ' she said one afternoon as they returned from the barn . I should like to live here , to know that each summer we could come out to this camp . ' I 'm too old , ' he said , although he had just finished proving that he was not . He was restrained not by age but by a sensible conviction that if he got too entangled with the Bucklands , he would face disaster . He wasp534far more worried about Henry Buckland than he was about Charlotte , because the canny merchant had begun to ask those penetrating questionswhich the curators of the Venneford Ranch could not answer . For some years Seccombe , in an effort to keep his Bristol investors happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1872 , for example , he had paid a tidy eight percent by the simple device of buying 6626 mature longhorns from L. D. Kane in Wyoming and turning around and selling 2493 of them to packing houses in Chicago for beef . He entered the sale on his books as a profit , as if it had been 2493 calves raised on the ranch that he had sold . There had also been unusual expenses connected to the acquisition of land , items he did not want to appear on the books , like the train fare for theTurious homesteaders from Elmwood , Illinois . Oliver Seccombe had not misappropriated any Venneford money for his own use , but he had diverted much of it into channels that he could not now explain satisfactorily . Buckland , becoming increasingly suspicious of Seccombe , started to make cautious inquiries among the ranch hands . One day at Line Camp Four he showed Skimmerhorn a report which had been assembled by Finlay Perkin . The Scotsman had lifted from the Venneford records an account of every animal the investors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Buckland : When you reach the ranch you should find these cattle on the premises : 1868 delivery by R. J. Poteet , Texas 2934purchase from L. D. Kane , Wyoming 48171869 delivery by J. J. Stoat , Texas 2404purchase from John Skene , Colorado 44191870 delivery by R. J.

Kennedy , Illinois 93Total stock acquired 42,282It would be desirable for you to check on the presence or absence of every animal listed , especially the expensive Shorthorns acquired from Illinois . Finlay Perkinp535When Skimmerhorn saw Perkin 's suggestion , he could not suppress a smile . Sir , ' he said disarmingly to Buckland , God himself does n't know where all those cattle are . ' And for the first time a Bristol member of Venneford Ranch Limited realized that running a herd of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the same as importing bolts of silk from India , or investing in consols , where a paper certificate proved that you had actual possession of the consols . Running cattle on a great western ranch was a little more imprecise . With this discovery , Buckland 's questioning became more detailed , and now John Skimmerhorn faced his second moral problem as manager of the ranch . The first one had come when he had helped Potato Brumbaughfight off the gunmen . This one centered , as it would on every western ranch owned by absentee Englishmen , on the phrase book count . Mr. Buckland pointed to the two purchases made from L. D. Kane , of Wyoming . They total eleven thousand head of cattle . A good many dollars are involved . Now , I feel sure you counted them as you got them . ' Skimmerhorn smiled nervously . You see , sir , that 's what we call book count . ' If you count , you count . ' But when you buy in that number . . . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where were they ? ' Book count means that there ought to be that number of cattle and that they ought to be somewhere . ' Good God ! ' You 're dealing with honorable men . If Kane says he has .. I would n't accept that kind of statement from the most prestigiousmerchant in India . If he says he 's sending me three hundred bolts .. Cattle are not bolts of silk , ' Seccombe interrupted . I 'm beginning to think they 're invisible . ' What Skimmerhorn did not tell Buckland , hence the moral question , was that he and Jim Lloyd had always had grave suspicions about the various book counts passed along to the Venneford Ranch . Finlay Perkin 's figures showed that the ranch had paid for more than forty-two thousand head of cattle ; Skimmerhorn doubted that more than twentyfivethousand were on hand now . And there was also the matter of how Seccombe paid dividends . Skimmerhorn did not consider Seccombe dishonest , although the Englishman did do irregular things . He was a man of vast ideas and enthusiasms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle , when in reality he had only twenty-five . And every year , in his tight little Bristol office , Finlay Perkin would add up the absent stock , acceptp536Seccombe 's estimate of how many calves should have been produced , and the truth grew even further from reality . Some day this miserable bubble would burst . Skimmerhorn judged it might happen when the outlying portions of the ranch were lost , or when fences framed in the actual land owned . Then the cattle could be counted , and the deficit would be astonishing . In the meantime , Skimmerhornwould keep meticulous records of each transaction in which he was personally involved , and if Finlay Perkin ever wanted to see his books , their facts would stand forth with crystal clarity . Under no circumstancescould Skimmerhorn betray Oliver Seccombe ; he would not alert Henry Buckland to the inherent falsity of the Venneford accounts . But he would not allow Seccombe 's manipulations to contaminate him . Through the bitter experience of being the son of Colonel Frank Skimmerhorn , John had learned how fatal a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of terrible , rock-hewn integrity , unafraid of Comanche or Kansas outlaws , not hesitant to help gun down the rustlers trying to steal Potato Brumbaugh 's farm , and he would remain that way . When Skimmerhorn left the camp , Henry Buckland remained as perplexedas ever . What it means , he reflected , is that in the cattle business the investor has to trust the manager . And he supposed he would have to trust Seccombe , in spite of doubts about book count . The fellow was congenial , and if he was what Charlotte wanted , she could do worse . And so the last days at the camp became a period of drift during which three people moved toward decisions about which each had apprehensions . Buckland 's concerning the stability of the ranch were never dispersed . Charlotte , seduced by the loveliness of Line Camp Four , was satisfied that come autumn Seccombe would propose to her , and she began inspectingthe northern range as if she were already its proprietor . It was certainly not the life she had planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still felt that close association with the Bucklands could be dangerous for him . He 'd had a very bad moment when Henry started boring in on details . Who could calculate to a bookkeeper 's satisfactionthe number of cattle on a range so large ? True , he had sold off breeding stock to get the funds to pay dividends , but many managers in Wyoming and Colorado were doing that , and if in the years ahead the calf crop was even average , the losses would easily be made up . But to give specific figures ? Who could be sure that some bull found every cow in heat , or impregnated her successfully if he did . Who could possibly know how many calves were born dead on a ranch with more than five million acres ? Or how many were killed by wolves ? Or stolen by rustlers ! Somewhere beyond the horizon Venneford had forty-two thousand cattle . Hell , that number could now be sixty thousand , or even seventy , if the calf crop was good . As low as twenty-five thousand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , and when they were needed they would be found . As he rode south with the Bucklands to ranch headquarters , they in a buckboard , he on horseback beside them , he decided to take the risk , to marry this challenging English girl and to get her father back to England as quickly as possible . Give me six good years , he said to himself , and I 'll get this thing straightened out . When the Bucklands were installed at headquarters , he rode in to Zendt 's Farm to consult with practical Levi and imaginative Lucinda , especially the latter . Perched on a stool in their kitchen , with a cup of hot coffee clutched in his hands , he confided , It looks as if I might marry . ' Good ! ' Levi cried . I 've often wondered .. Lucinda did not speak . Instead , she rose , walked to the stool and kissed the Englishman as if he were a member of her family . Pulling one of his hands from the cup , she grasped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English girls at Cheyenne ? ' Levi asked with a boy 's excitement . Buckland 's daughter . ' She 's not much older than Clemma , ' Levi blurted out , and Lucinda glared at him . She 's twenty-one , ' Seccombe said . And I 'm . . Older than I am , ' Levi said bluntly . You must be insane . ' Wait a minute , ' Lucinda said . No man is ever too old to need a wife . God created us .. At this moment Clemma Zendt came in , a marvelously beautiful girl of eighteen , and she passed through the kitchen like a summer breeze , recalling flowers . She said nothing , nodded toward Seccombe , then hurriedby on some important mission of her own . She seemed very young , and Seccombe was especially aware of this . Do n't be an old fool , ' Levi counseled . If you need a wife , get one your own age among the English families in Cheyenne . ' Does she love you ? ' Lucinda asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ? ' Yes . ' Then marry her . ' That was her position , and she held to it . She invited the Bucklands to dinner , and when they were seated and the roast pig was on the table  --  purchased from Potato Brumbaugh  --  she said as she poured the lapsang , I hear you and Oliver are getting married . ' Yes , ' Charlotte said , although the matter was by no means settled . Good . Levi , fetch a bottle of wine , ' and a startled Henry Buckland drank to the good health of his future son-in-law , a man four years older than he.  |p538The  wedding was held in Cheyenne at the home of Claude Barker , an Englishman who was putting together a mighty ranch along Horse Creek . It was a gala occasion , with champagne imported from France and singingand croquet on the lawn under torchlights . The English community wished the newlyweds well , pleased that others from back home were settling in the territories . The affair was marred only by one slight incident . Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new ranch , heard Barker say , I bought a good share of my stock from L. D. Kane . ' ' Book count ? ' Buckland asked . Of course . The man 's a bounder . Probably did n't have half the cattle he said , but what could I do ? I needed his water rights . ' Who is Kane ? ' Chap out from London . More money than brains . ' Buckland thought , He has brains enough to keep on selling cattle he does n't have . And when he returned to Bristol he discussed this matter with Finlay Perkin , who for the first time began to view the fine figuresin his books with some skepticism , CENTENNIAL / 538In 1875 , when the buffalo were finally exterminated and the hunters went out no more , Amos Calendar appeared at Zendt 's Farm driving a large four-wheeled army wagon , his unneeded Sharps across his knees . He was collecting buffalo bones , to be used back east for the making of fertilizer . He scoured the prairies , returning to haunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones for delivery to the nearest railway . Selecting a spot north of Line Camp Four , he received permission from the railway to accumulate bones there until he had a carload . Then he fanned out across the prairie searching for skeletons , and travelers would report in various towns : I was goin ' down this hill when what do you think I seen ? This big wagon drawn by two mules with a skinny man holdin ' the reins , a big gun acrost his knees . And the wagon was filled with bones . ' Alone , always alone , Calendar became the hunter again , and gradually he built up at his depot a gigantic mound of bones . At intervals he placed some specially large skull on a stake with this message scrawled across its white forehead : These bones is mine . Calendar . ' Having shot the last of the buffalo , he now seemed determined to removefrom earth all visible signs that the great animal had ever existed , as if God had commanded , You made the mess . Clean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line Camp Five , where at Chalk Cliff his keen eye detected signs that here buffalo had once jumped to their death . For the buffalo hunter , a stand was what he dreamed of ; for the bone picker it was the site of an ancient jump , because if he foundp539such a place , he could dig it for days , exhuming the skeletons of hundredsof long-dead animals . As Calendar was probing at the base of the cliff , Jim Lloyd came by on one of his inspections . He had not known that Calendar was in the area , but seeing him brought happy recollections of their drive north in ' 68 . Huntin ' , ' Calendar said when Jim asked what he had done after that . That run out , now I 'm bone collectin ' . ' Pay well ? ' Maybe nine dollars a ton . ' These bones are pretty light , ' Jim said , hefting a desiccated skull . They add . ' You taking these ? ' I thought to . ' Go ahead . ' But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported Calendar 's activities to her father , and next day a curious Levi rode out to Chalk Cliff  --  and this led to a discovery which eventually rocked intellectualcircles throughout the world . For as Levi stood by , watching Calendar as he unearthed a hoard of bones which would require weeks to exhaust , he happened to look at a series of purplish rocks exposed at the base of the cliff , well below the level where the buffalo bones were , and protruding from this rock he saw what he first supposed to be part of a buffalo . That was some buffalo ! ' he said , amazed at the size of the projecting bone . That ai n't no buffalo , ' Calendar said . Never saw no buffalo bone inside a rock . ' With the destructive urge that seemed an inherent part of his character , he lifted a large rock and was about to smash the strange bone , but Levi restrained him . This could be something important , ' he said . What ? ' I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped . You leave that bone there , ' he said . I 'm goin ' back to town . ' When he reached home he asked his wife for the magazine with the story of the professor from Harvard , and with some excitement he thumbed through it and found the article he was seeking . It told of the work being done by Professor Horace Wright at Harvard in Massachusetts . Working upon principles developed in England , he had been diggingin New Jersey clay pits and had come up with the bones of animals dead for millions of years . Woodcuts showed what the monstrous creaturesmay have looked like , and as Levi studied them he recalled that gigantic skeleton of the elephant he and Elly had seen at the museum in St. Louis . That same night , unable to drive the visions of these ancient animalsp540from his head , Levi rode to the telegraph station in Greeley and dispatcheda telegram which was to become famous : PROFESSOR HORACE WRIGHT HARVARD UNIVERSITY CAMBRIDGE , MASSACHUSETTSBELIEVE ON MY FARM COLORADO HAVE DISCOVERED BONE OF PREHISTORIC ELEPHANT STOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always on the search for fossils , roared out to Cheyenneby the earliest train , and there is no other verb that could more accurately describe his arrival . He was known to his contemporaries , and especially to his adversaries , as Horrible Horace , a huge , arrogant man educated in Germany and married to the daughter of a New England textile millionaire . He never visited a site ; he invaded it , with two assistantsand if at all possible an equal number of newspapermen and photographers . He wore formal clothes , including striped pants , even when at work on a dig , and although he had been photographed numerous times at various dramatic excavations , he was never shown without a top hat . He delighted in convening the press wherever he worked and announcingto them : Gentlemen , we have this day uncovered one of the most remarkable secrets in the history of mankind . ' He was hated by those who worked for him and despised by his rivals at Yale . He was insufferable , pompous and brilliant , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the history of American science . At Cheyenne he hired four wagons , two tents and a cook , and like an emperor , moved south to Chalk Cliff . Levi Zendt and Jim Lloyd were waiting for him , and when they saw a cloud of dust to the east Jim said , Maybe the army is escorting him , ' but it was only Horrible Horace travelingin customary style . He ordered his driver to draw the wagon close to the cliff , and majesticallydismounted , a man over six feet tall plus his top hat . Striding with sure instinct to the spot where Levi had found the bone , he ignored it . Dropping to his knees , he spent fifteen or twenty minutes inspecting the basic rock from which the bone projected , and as he poked and probed , he grunted with deep satisfaction , like a hog finding acorns . He summoned his assistants and pointed out to them the characteristics of this base rock , then asked in haughty tones , Well , gentlemen , what is it ? ' Morrison ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it 's Morrison ! ' he exploded . You dunderheads , look at the purple color , the alternate clays , the texture . What else could it be but Morrison ? ' Even now he did not bother to look at the bone itself . Instead , hep541summoned the lone newspaperman he had bullied into coming down from Cheyenne , and proclaimed , Sir , you may inform the waiting world that here on the property of this good man , ' and he placed his right arm benignly about the shoulder of Levi Zendt , I have discovered the bones of a great dinosaur .. Elephant ? ' Levi asked . Infinitely older . ' How old ? ' the reporter asked . One million years . . . two million . ' You have n't looked at the bone yet , ' the reporter pointed out . My good man , ' Professor Wright said condescendingly as he kickedat the base rock . This is Morrison . Do you understand that ? Morrison ! ' Who 's Morrison ? ' the reporter asked . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he abandoned Levi and placed his encompassing arm about the reporter . It 's a purplish formation of clay and rock . It exists in a small belt throughout the west , and where you find Morrison , you find dinosaurs . Now this one .. At last he attended to the bone , and as he did so his jaw dropped . My hammer , ' he said in a whisper , and when he had it , he tapped ever so delicately at the rock which embedded the bone , then moved along the face of the cliff , returning to the men with a look of positive awe upon his face . All the pomposity was gone and he became a man staggeredby good fortune . My God ! ' he said . It looks as if we have a complete dinosaur . ' The reporter asked , Would that be a good find . . . important ? ' It would be notable , ' Wright said in a low voice . What can I call it ? What name ? ' That we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon , calling for flour and old newspapers , from which he made a heavy protective paste in which to envelop the bones . In the days that followed , newsmen and photographers came from all parts of America to watch , and every new visitor who saw the imposing chalk cliff assumed that the bones lay imbedded in it , and they were surprised to find Professor Wright laboring away in the purplish deposits at the base of the cliff . This is the Morrison , ' he explained over and over , and he laid out stakes to indicate the incredible extent of the skeleton on which he was working . Maybe seventy feet , ' he said , and even the most skeptical visitor had to be impressed . Finally the day came when he felt prepared to issue a formal communique , so he assembled the press and visiting scientists and stood before them in a black suit and top hat . Gentlemen , ' he said gravely , I have the honor to announce that on this site I have uncovered the complete articulated skeleton of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weighed in the vicinity of thirty tons . Not ap542single bone is missing , and this must stand as one of the supreme finds of all times . ' He went on to disclose that the skeleton , when excavated , would go to a museum in Berlin . But , ' someone asked , if it 's as great a find as you say it is , and it was discovered in America , why do you allow it to go to Germany ? ' The world of science is international , ' he proclaimed . Museums in Germany aided me when I was starting . Now I shall aid them . ' This launched somewhat of an argument , which ended when Levi Zendt pointed out that the skeleton actually belonged to him , since it was found on his property , and he agreed with Professor Wright . He , Zendt , had come from Germany  --  that is , his family had  --  and it was only proper that he send a gift back to the home country . Thank you , my good man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. , So the notable skeleton was shipped off to Berlin , which led a Denver politician who had graduated from Yale to ask , What else would you expect from a Harvard man ? ' The next summer , at Rattlesnake Buttes , Horrible Horace uncovered a striking set of titanothere bones , accompanied by complete skeletons of camels , mammoths and dire wolves . But what gained greatest attention , especially from ranchers in the west , was his discovery in subsequentyears of handsome skeletons of four of the progenitors of the horse : eohippus , mesohippus , miohippus and the crucial , determinative merychippus . When this learned tyrant ended his excavations , men knew that inages past the land of Colorado had been shared by gigantic dinosaurs beyond their imagining , and bison with unbelievable horns , and titanollutheres and animals not yet visualized , and men became aware of the fact that the earth which they had been assuming was theirs had always belonged to other creatures , too . Perhaps the most lasting local effect of Professor Wright 's frenetic invasion came in something he casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dig at Rattlesnake Buttes . He had found a little treasure , an articulated skeleton of eohippus , the tiny creature who had grown into the horse , and as he contemplated it he said , In their day they must have been as common as rabbits . ' Jim repeated this to men at the ranch , and sometimes when they saw a jackrabbit tearing across the brown grass , they thought of older days and other grasses , when tiny horses were as common as rabbits . What Jim Lloyd hopefully referred to as his love affair with Clemma Zendt ' was not going well . It had never gone well . From the start it had been a ridiculous thing , scarcely involved with love at all . To speakp543accurately , it had been nothing but a fatuous obsession , but each year it deepened . It had begun that July day in 1868 when Mr. Seccombe had accepted Jim as one of his new cowboys . As Jim rode out of Zendt 's Farm that morning to finish the drive , he carried with him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he needed her . The punishing ride north from Texas , the gunfights that had changed him from a boy to a man and the suspicion that he might never see his mother again made him hunger for friendship , so as soon as he had delivered the longhorns to Venneford , he rode back to the village , presenting himself at the store . Name 's Jim Lloyd , ' he said with becoming embarrassment . I wondered .. He could not finish the sentence . He could n't come out and say , I 'd like permission to meet your daughter , ' and he became additionally flustered when her older brother banged his way through the store , askingbrusquely , What do you want , sonny ? ' Mrs. Zendt , an understanding woman with dark skin and laughing eyes , had observed the encounter that morning and could guess what Jim 's mission was , so to rescue him from further embarrassment she asked , Did you wish to open a charge account ? ' That 's it ! ' Jim cried , and she explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledger for him , and the solemn attention he paid to her instructions made her realize how old this apparent child really was . Fourteen going on fifty , ' Skimmerhorn had said . Knowing that he wanted to see Clemma , she said casually , Would you care to have a cup of coffee . . . in the kitchen . . . with my daughter ? ' Yes ! ' he blurted , and for the first time he met with Clemma . What a delectable child she was that year , thirteen and blossoming , with red in her cheeks and a sly grin . When she had detected him smiling at her as the longhorns forded the Platte , she knew that he would seek her out ; she also knew intuitively what tricks to use if she wanted him to return . So , affecting to have no interest in him , she positioned herself so that he could not keep his eyes away from her . And when he did look , she twisted her head in such a flirtatious way that his mouth fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him , She 's part Indian , ' and now he saw that this fact showed in her high cheekbones and squarish chin . Her eyes were quite dark and her black hair hung in braids through which were intertwined porcupine quills , in the old fashion . But there was something else , indefinable , that said she was Indian : the total ease with which she moved . What he could not see was that she also had the Indian woman 's sense of humor , a mocking view of life which she had acquired from herp544mother and which she now directed at her first suitor . She would make Jim 's life miserable , but also refulgent . During the next two years whenever he was in town he tried to talk with her seriously , but she rebuffed him , for she could see him only as an awkward cowboy with few graces , and she was already beginning to set her heart on something more polished and congenial . She studied the strangers who stopped by the store on their way from Omaha to Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be . As a consequence , she thought of Jim as a child much younger than herself . At sixteen Jim decided to do something that would convince her of his seriousness . He chose a Sunday , and in his best clothes rode into the village and tied his horse to the railing in front of the store . There he waited till the Zendts returned from church , and when he saw Levi he walked boldly up to him and asked , Could I speak to you , Mr. Zendt ? ' and when the storekeeper nodded , Jim followed him into the parlor . Clutching his hands behind him , he said , Mr. Zendt , I wish to court your daughter . ' Levi did not smile . After all , he had married Elly when she was but little older than Clemma , so the idea of formal courtship was not preposterous . He treated Jim with dignity , but pointed out , James , I see no evidence that Clemma is eager to be courted by you or anyone else . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . ' In such matters , James , it 's best to arrange things first with the girl . ' I thought that out of respect for you and Mrs. Zendt .. We appreciate your good manners , and Clemma will , too . ' But when he sent Jim to her , she laughed at him . Who 'd be thinking about such things ? ' she teased , refusing to take him seriously , so that he fled from the store in confusion . During the next three years Jim returned often , waiting hungrily for a glimpse of Clemma , but she persisted in ignoring him . This in no way diminished his ardor ; his obsession intensified , and when through sheer boredom she allowed him to walk with her one day through the cottonwoodsand actually kiss her , he became dizzy . For months thereafter he could remember that kiss ; it had burned its way into his , mind . He became convinced that Clemma Zendt had been created for him , that only she could fill the other half of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior mulish and told him , You better forget that Indian gal and do yourself some good in Cheyenne , ' but the idea repelled him , and they began to think he might be effeminate . Then R. J. Poteet came back up the trail with anotherconsignment of longhorns and with him came Bufe Coker , who had decided to try his luck in Colorado . Do n't you underestimate Jim Lloyd , ' he told the Venneford hands.  |p545He  killed his man at age fourteen . ' And the cowboys treated the moonstruckyoung man with more respect . In 1873 , when Jim was nineteen , he decided it was time to propose formally . He had a good job , some savings and quarters at the ranch in which to house a family . Again he chose a Sunday , and again he dressed in his best suit , but this time when the Zendts returned from church he ignored Levi and Clemma and went directly to Mrs. Zendt . I truly believe that Clemma 's happiness depends upon marrying me , ' he said gravely . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason with her , Mrs. Zendt ? ' Jim , if she does n't .. Ca n't you people see I 'm a responsible person ? ' Of course , Jim . You 'd make a wonderful husband .. Then please speak to her . ' Mrs. Zendt was embarrassed , not by Jim 's awkward proposal but by what she was forced to tell him . In decency , Clemma should have broken the news , but she had never taken Jim seriously and it had not occurred to her that she owed him this courtesy . So the task was left to her mother . Jim , marriage right now is impossible . Clemma 's going to St. Louis . ' Jim sat silent . His eyes seemed to lose focus , as if someone had clubbed him over the head with the butt of a rifle . Then , as if from a distance , he heard the words again : She 's going to St. Louis the way I did when I was her age . For an education . To make a lady of herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's the way it was . Miss Clemma Zendt , age eighteen , held a parasol over her head as they rode in Jim 's wagon to Cheyenne , where she took the Union Pacific to St. Louis . There she boarded with her cousin , Cyprian Pasquinel , the elderly white-haired congressman , who enrolled her in the convent school her mother had attended back in 1845 . Her letters home were infrequent . After she had been away two months , Jim arrived at the store with a solemn proposition : If Clemma 's getting this good education in St. Louis , and if I 'm going to marry her some day , do n't you think I 'd better educate myself right here ? ' Levi and Lucinda thought this a first-rate idea and proposed that he take lessons from Miss Keller , the middle-aged schoolteacher . So three nights a week , when he was not obliged to be out at Line Camp One or Two , Jim would ride over to the Stumper Farm , where Miss Keller boarded , and do his lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most especially , a sense of the continuity of man and his limitless potential . Miss Keller , a New England woman in her thirties , did not suffer from limited horizons ; to her the lessons of Rome and London were as pertinent as those of New York and Chicago , and she believed that by and large those men and women who were openly committed to somep546worthy goal achieved more than those who were reluctant to associate themselves with anything . It was from her that Jim first became aware of the gross injustices under which the west suffered . It 's like this , Jim . At the end of the Civil War my father bought a farm in Kansas for nine thousand dollars . He paid five in cash , got four in a mortgage . At that time there were x numberof dollars in circulation . ' What do you mean by x ? ' From algebra . You remember . An arbitrary unknown . ' Sure . ' Well , every year since then the population in America has increased , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend what this means ? ' That to pay back his mortgage , your father has less and less chance to get any of those dollars . ' Exactly ! The system makes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ' She spoke also of the railroads . They got this fantastic amount of land from the government , from the west really , from you and me , and when they had their monopoly , they charged us anything they wished . Did you know that it costs an Illinois farmer two dollars to ship his steer a thousand mlies ? It costs a Colorado farmer four dollars . Same with wheat , same with lumber , same with trade goods coming this way . We are crucified by the railroads , who ought to be our servants . ' She spoke especially of silver , which Jim had never thought of . Do you know why this nation is collapsing in panic ? Right now ? Because the people holding gold dollars wo n't allow silver dollars to be cast . They do n't want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the governmentwith one hundred pennies of work . They want to force us into buyinggold dollars from them at one hundred and seventy pennies of our work . This nation is staggering to its knees because no money is cir-culating . ' Sometimes she became enraged when spelling out an injustice : Do you know why Englishmen own the ranch you work on ? And those other big ranches in Wyoming ? Because there 's not enough cash circulatingin the United States . Americans like you and my father ca n't get your hands on money to buy land and run cattle . My father would just love to own Venneford Ranch . . . if he could borrow the money from Chicago bankers the way Englishmen borrow from their London banks . ' So Jim studied the books she provided , books he could never have stumbled upon by himself : Darwin 's Origin of Species and Descent of Man ; Alfred Russel Wallace 's Natural Selection ; Matthew Arnold 's Cultureand Anarchy and Mark Twain 's Roughing It . With such guidance Jim made of himself an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and Washington but also at Venneford and Line Camp Three.  |p547The  news he got from St. Louis was not good . Travelers returning to Denver sometimes stopped off in Zendt 's Farm to report on how Clemma Zendt was capturing the heart of the gateway city : She 's attending dances every night , it seemed to us . Very popular with the young officers . ' One night after class Jim stopped at the store and told the Zendts , I 'm worried . She does n't answer my letters . . Jim ! ' Lucinda said , pouring coffee and arranging a plate of doughnuts . I was the same way ! Ask Levi . ' She laughed and kissed her husband . I 'm sure he must have thought I 'd never come back to a little town like this . . . after having known St. Louis . ' A delightful smile came over her face as she recalled those days , and she reached for her husband 's hand . So many young men , ' she mused , but I came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , in the summer of 1874 , a tall slim girl with her black hair coiled on top of her head , and except for high cheekbones , no evidence that she was part Indian . She was a lady now , nineteen years old and beautiful in a new way . She had a certain languor and seemed ill-at-ease in her father 's store . Gratuitously she dropped hints of having been to Chicago and of a visit to New York to see the family of a young officer serving in the forts south of St. Louis . She found Jim Lloyd ridiculously stiff and not much fun to be with , for he either spent their time together proposing or airing his newly acquiredknowledge of things that did not interest her . She asked him once if he drank , and he did not realize that she was intimating that she wanted a whiskey . Instead , he said with awkward firmness , Bufe Coker drinks a good deal , but he 's a southerner . ' When the time came for her to return to St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for Jim 's feelings and did not even volunteer a kiss , but seeing the despair in his eyes , she leaned from the train window , took his hand and said gaily , Do n't look so glum , Jim . I 'll be back . ' On this small shred of hope Jim lived for three months , but at Christmashe could no longer deceive himself . Sitting in the Zendt kitchen , he confided that Clemma had not once written to him , whereupon Mrs. Zendt broke into tears . She wrote to us ! ' she said bitterly , showing the letter to Jim . And there it was : Mom , Lt. Jack Ferguson and I were married on December 10 . He lives in New York and is very nice . I am going to have a baby soon . ClemmaThere was another letter , from Cyprian Pasquinel , and it was brutally frank , the letter of a relative who could not comprehend what had happenedunder the roof of his hospitality :  |p548Of  all the young men who courted her in our home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Army has ever stationed in this district . If he stays with her a month after the baby is born , I 'll be the most amazed man in Missouri . When this harsh estimate was shown Jim , he sat silently in the Zendt kitchen , drumming his fingers on the table . Twice he tried to speak , but there were tears in his eyes and he seemed afraid lest his voice break . Finally he pushed back his chair and said something the senior Zendts would never forget : She 'll need me . I must go find her . ' He withdrew what money he had in the bank and late that afternoon returned to the ranch , where he saddled his horse , riding all night to reach Cheyenne in time to catch the morning train for St. Louis , where he sought out Cyprian Pasquinel . Turn away from that girl , young man , ' the congressman advised . You say that only because she 's an Indian , ' Jim countered , willing to grasp at any straw . Pasquinel laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her mother is a member of our family . So is Clemma . Simple fact is , she 's inherited all the weaknesses of her uncles . And you know what happened to them . ' That 's cruel ! ' Jim protested , but the congressman stuck to his guns . Forget that wild Indian girl , ' he counseled . It was to no avail . Jim spent more than a week searching St. Louis for her , wandering through all parts of the city , hoping to pick up a trace of her  --  along the waterfront , in the hotels , through the mean streets . But he did not find her . The winter of 1875 passed , and no one in Zendt 's Farm could even guess where Clemma might be , or whether her baby was safely born , or whether it was a boy or girl . The Zendts wrote letters to friends in Chicagoand New York , and Cyprian Pasquinel made inquiries at the War Department in Washington . All that he discovered was that Lieutenant Ferguson had been dismissed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge in New Orleans and had not been heard from since . And then in the spring of that year an army officer was dispatched to Denver to check on the western forts , and one afternoon he stopped by the store to tell Lucinda , I knew your daughter in St. Louis . She was lucky to get shed of that Ferguson . ' What happened to him ? ' Lucinda asked quietly . Living with a French girl in Boston , I think . ' And Clemma ? ' You mean . . . you have n't heard from her ? ' No . ' I am sorry . You have n't heard then that the baby died ? '  |p549'No  . ' All her Indian stoicism revealed itself in this brief word . Lucinda had no sense of shame , no reticence . Her daughter had vanished and she would be grateful for any information . I have no idea where she is , ' the officer said , and Lucinda nodded . When Jim heard this news he was distraught and announced his intention of trying once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall never forget how you put everything aside to search for her , but that was enough . You 've done all that could be expected and now you must put her out of your mind . ' Can you put her out of yours ? ' No , but I 'm her father . ' I 'm to be her husband , ' Jim said . And instead of forgetting her , as he should have done , he became more obsessed with the belief that he was meant to find her , to care for her . Whenever he came to town he asked the Zendts if they had heard anything , and he convinced himself that one day she would write him , and would wait somewhere for him to rescue her . Jim let it be known that he had no interest in meeting girls , and not much in other kinds of social life , either . He directed his energy toward the ranch , and became so proficient that he received attractive offers from several English corporations running large herds to the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two men he trusted . He intensified his study of nature , analyzing the habits of birds and small animals , but found his greatest delight in supervising the Crown Vee Herefords . He became known throughout the industry as Jim Lloyd , the Hereford man , ' a name in which he took restrained pride . In 1876 everything connected with Zendt 's Farm reached a climax . To begin with , Congress at last agreed to accept Colorado into the Union as the thirty-eighth state , and it was decided that entry should be made on August 1 , just after the hundredth anniversary of the nation . Statehood should have come much earlier , in 1866 , as a matter of fact , and it would have , except that southern sympathizers in the territory , combining with those who still revered Colonel Skimmerhorn for his gallant victory at Rattlesnake Buttes , proposed that the constitution of the new state contain a proviso ensuring that in Colorado , so long as the state endured , only white men should be allowed to vote . Since there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly no Indians , the only reason these patriots could cite for such exclusion was that it sounded fashionable . Sort of makes us modern , ' they said , and their fellow citizens enthusiasticallyadopted the proposal . The national Senate and Housep550accepted. it , too , on grounds that the people of a state ought to be able to choose whom they wished to share their responsibilities with . President Andrew Johnson , however , made short shrift of the bill when it reached his desk . He vetoed it with a sharp rebuke , basing his decision not on the moral problem of discrimination but on the practical fact of population decline plus the results of a recent plebescite which contradicted earlier mandates : Colorado , instead of increasing , has declined in population . At an electionin 1861 , 10,580 votes were cast . At the election in 1864 , the number of votes cast was 6192 ; while at the election held in 1865 , the aggregateof votes was 5905 . . . It is not satisfactorily established that a majority of citizens desire state government . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , 6192 votes were cast , and of this number a majority of 3152 was given against statehood . Perhaps a divine counselor sat at Johnson 's elbow when he penned these words , for had he admitted Colorado at that time , her two senators would surely have voted against him in the forthcoming impeachment  --  they said so  --  and he would have become the only President to be removed from office . At any rate , in 1866 Colorado remained a territory . Now , in pleasanter times , and with the offending proviso eliminated , Colorado was to become a state , and there were celebrations from border to border . There were also elections ! The new state would be entitled to two senators , who would be chosen by the legislature , since it was felt that the general public was not qualified to vote directly for such an august position , and one congressman ; seeing that he was of a lower order , the public would be permitted to vote for him directly . As the time for statehood approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zendt 's Farm . It was the schoolteacher , Miss Keller , who launched it , and no sooner had she uttered her suggestion , than it caught the imagination of everyone : Zendt 's Farm is no name for a town that 's destined to be a city . Let 's celebrate the double birthday and renameourselves Centennial ! ' The idea was so popular that it was two days before anyone thought to ask , What will Levi say ? After all , he founded the place . ' He thought it a great idea . Never did like Zendt 's Farm , ' he said . As a matter of fact , I do n't like the name Zendt . Everyone I knew with that name either was stingy or ornery , except my mother . And she was born a Spreichert . ' Lucinda said she thought the name Centennial was perfect , and that afternoon dated a letter to Cyprian : Centennial , Colorado , June 9 , 1876 , ' the first appearance of the name in any document . So the decision was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flamboyant celebration was arranged at the river to usher in the secondp551hundred years of American independence and the birth of the new town . Steers donated by the Venneford Ranch were roasted , and patriotic speeches were made , predicting a notable future for both the nation and the town , but festivities were dampened when word arrived on the train from Cheyenne that on an undistinguished battleground in Montana , Colonel George Armstrong Custer with all his men had been massacred by the Sioux and vengeful Cheyenne . Pasquinel Mercy was among them , chosen specifically by Custer to be his aide after the buffalo hunt on the Union Pacific . When a young cowboyran into the midst of the celebration , shouting the awful news , Mercy 's pregnant young wife , Laura Skimmerhorn , fainted , and some celebrants began to stare accusingly at Lucinda Zendt . The nation was now a hundred years old , the town thirty-two , dating from that August day in 1844 when Levi Zendt and the McKeags arrivedto establish their trading post . In the case of both nation and town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history would consist of their slow maturing . For the nation : what to do about race ? how to control expanding business ? how to distribute the growing wealth ? For Centennial , history would be what it always had been : how could man adjust to his harsh surroundings ? how could he use his land creatively ? CAUTION TO US EDITORS : As a southerner I have always shared the westerner 's suspicion of railroads . Had I been either a rancher or a farmer in the west , I would have been quite bitter about the insolent way in which the railroads treated me . Discriminatory rates , arbitrary rulings on cattle and feed grains , refusal to provide service and arrogant indifference to my problems  --  all of which we endured in the south  --  would have been infuriating , and I would have enrolled myself among the agitators . The abuses stemmed from the fact that the owners of the railroads never saw themselves as servants to an expanding nation ; they were men trying to squeeze the last penny of profit from a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverted economic law and persecuted anyone who tried to hold them to a more honest discharge of their duties . As a result , even today westerners buy airplane tickets with actual relish , and out here the current call for public support for the railroads falls on deaf ears . If Commodore Vanderbilt did indeed say , The public be damned , ' what the descendants of that public now say to the railroads is unprintable . Diplodocus . The dinosaur excavated at Chalk Cliff in 1875 becamep552known as diplodocus , and some years later along the border of Coloradoand Utah an expedition financed by Andrew Carnegie dug up two beautifulspecimens . One now rests in a handsome setting in the Denver Museumof Natural History and is the gem of that collection . Carnegie wasso delighted with his find that at his own expense he had molds madefor each separate bone in the skeleton , hundreds of them , and circulatedplaster casts to various museums throughout the world , so that peopleeverywhere could enjoy his dinosaur . ' A later cast from the molds , this time in cement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Utah , not far from where the original diplodocus roamed 136,000,000 years ago , and it is enormous . Triceratops . The lands around Rattlesnake Buttes proved rewarding to many teams of excavators . Starting in 1873 and continuing through the rest of the nineteenth century , scientists dug a startling variety of bones . In the twentieth century , teams from Europe and eastern universitieshave continued the work . This Year , in Pleistocene clay beds I myself found the jaw of an eohippus ; it shone in my hand like a little jewel , and just north of Chalk Cliff , in a classic Morrison deposit , I had the thrill of finding an entire armored collar that triceratops carried about his neck , erecting it into a formidable defense whenever some predator attacked . It is very exciting , I can assure you , to hold in your hand the remnant of a giant lizard who stood 70,000,000 years ago where you now stand . Warning . You understand , and your caption writer must too , that nohuman being has ever seen a dinosaur bone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone , but rather the petrification of a bone that had once existed . All so-called dinosaur bones are in fact stones formed within the matrix of the original bone . What happened was this : When the original bone was buried , water containing silica seeped into it , and ever so slowly the silica was deposited within the bone . In time the bony structure dissolved and was completely replaced by stone , in such minute detail that from the appearance of the stone we can today deduce with total accuracy even the cell structure of the original bone , and can indeed diagnose what diseases the bone may have suffered . No one has ever seen a bone of diplodocus , but the stony recollection of thatgreat beast is even more exciting and beautiful than I have been able to describe . Records .

The Niobrara Land and Cattle Company carried 39,000 cattle on their books ; in liquidation they could find only 9000 . These errors came about principally because managers made rough estimates of their calf crops : We have 1000 cows and it stands to reason85 percent will drop calves , so next year we 'll have 1850 critters .

Name Colorado derives from Spanish and can mean either red , colored or a dirty joke.  |p557IF  ANY SECTION OF THE UNITED STATESever enjoyed a true golden age , it must have been the cattle regions of the west in the early 1880s . There had been previous fine periods . The New England shipping industry in the 1840s had been magnificent , with whalers sailing distant seas and merchant vessels opening the Orient . The prosperity of cotton plantations in the early 1850s , when British markets were begging to buy , and slaves were docile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to rivers like the James and the Rappahannockto load bales , certainly deluded their owners into believing that cotton was king . And the hectic 1870s , when eastern manufacturers controlled the nation , sending their finished products out on the new railroads at huge profits , buying their raw materials cheaply from the south and west , working their labor fourteen hours a day and controlling the money market to suit their purposes , were a heyday long remembered . But none of these earlier periods of exuberance surpassed the euphoria that settled over the west in the dazzling eighties . In those years winters were mild and cattle proliferated ; investments in land produced enormous dividends ; and citizens of all types saw before them a constantly expandinghorizon . Like the men in earlier decades who had basked in the sun of fishing , or cotton , or manufacturing , the ranchers of the west truly believed that their golden age must continue forever , for if gold dazzles , it also blinds . No group prospered more than those canny British who had long before spotted this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry for investment . In later years it would be popular to lampoon these foreigners as remittance men , ' as if incompetent third and fourth sons were exiled to the west on small monthly payments to keep them out of trouble and , more important , out of sight . Many American dramaticcompanies , flitting from town to town on night trains , kept in theirp558repertoire plays which made fun of these remittance men , relying on strange accents and unfamiliar customs to draw derisive laughter , but the truth was otherwise . The sturdy merchants of Bristol sent out only first-class men to check on their considerable investments at the Venneford Ranch . The tightfistedmarmalade millionaires of Dundee did their best to run their great Chugwater Ranch effectively , and they did not dispatch nincompoops to do the job . In Texas the Matador Ranch , largest of all , was run primarily by shrewd investors from London , while over at Horse Creek the merchantsof Liverpool were putting together a fine ranch under the leadershipof Claude Barker . The most beautiful ranch of all , Beau Brae on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managed by ultracautiousScottish businessmen from Edinburgh , and they intended to make money . The Englishmen who supervised the railroads , protecting British investmentsthere , were excellent people , and those who operated the mines were even better , for a more courageous type of man was required . The irrigation men were prudent , while those dealing primarily in land were bold . They brought their women with them , or sent for them after a short stay in America , and during these years along the ColoradoWyomingborder , English and Scottish patterns of life predominated . The land between the two Plattes could not properly be called an English colony , for the local political leaders were apt to be Dutchmen or toughmindedKentuckians , but socially the area was an outreach of **40;1357;TOOLONG , and the hard-working Britishers were determined to enjoy themselves . In September of 1880 a group of young American ranchers , educated at Harvard and Yale , accompanied Claude Barker of Wolf Pass on a ride down from Cheyenne to visit with Oliver Seccombe on a matter of some importance . Venneford was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch carpenters and stonemasons . There were barns and corrals , of course , and a long , low range of sheds in which boss hands like Skimmerhorn and Lloyd worked , but the center of activity was the three-story red-stone Gothic mansion erected by the Seccombes . It was an imposing residence , resembling a castle on the upper reaches of the Rhine , and it became famous throughout the west . Three rounded towers soared above the corners of the large house , with a four-sided battlement rising at the fourth corner . The roof containedeleven chimneys and was broken repeatedly by dormers . The ground floor was surrounded by a pillared veranda , while all doors leadinginto the house were made of heavy oak studded with brass fittings . It was possible to sleep eighteen guests in comfort , with four Negro servantsto attend their needs . What we have in mind , ' Claude Barker told the Seccombes , is a club . . . a gentlemen 's club . We 've selected a suitable corner in Cheyenne ,  |p559and  we 'll keep the membership exclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right kind of background . ' What are you calling it ? ' Charlotte Seccombe asked . The Cactus Club , ' Barker said . Oh , that 's delicious ! ' Charlotte cried , but her husband was more interested in the list of proposed members . They were all substantial cattlemen , except for the manager of the Union Pacific Railroad ; of the initial twenty members , fourteen would be Americans , six British . Sociallythey were impeccable ; in ranching , the most powerful . Will only twenty families be able to support such a club ? ' Seccombe asked warily . He and Charlotte were sorely overextended by the building of their mansion ; true , she had put up most of the money , but he had had to sell off more Crown Vee stock to scrape up his share , and he did not relish the idea of added expense right now . We have a subsidiary list , ' Bill Warsaw , one of the Americans said , and he showed Seccombe forty additional names , some less glittering socially than the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are great years for cattle , ' Barker added enthusiastically . Ranchers have money . ' If you enlarge the list to include this second category , ' Seccombe said , we 'll come in . " Papers of incorporation were filed on September 22 , 1880 , and the famous Cactus Club of Cheyenne was founded . It retained that name only briefly , for at an early meeting Seccombe proposed , Cactus seems rather repelling . Let 's call it simply the Cheyenne Club , ' and the change was made . Its rules were rigid . They were patterned after the fine clubs in London , to which most of the British members belonged , and their purpose was to create an ambience in which a conservative cattleman could feel at ease , protected from grubby merchants , importuning businessmen and small-time farmers . Fireplaces in the various rooms were decorated with blue-and-white tiles depicting scenes and quotations from Shakespeare , and the members who occupied these rooms were expected to conform to the highest standards of decorum .
