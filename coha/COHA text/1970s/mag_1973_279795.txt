Maybe there never was , and never will be , a perfect ballplayer . But let me ask you this : What was there that Frankie Frisch could n't do ? <P> - Joe McCarthy , New York Yankees manager , 1931-46 <P> In the eternal summer of baseball memories , single images stand out : Babe Ruth , all massive shoulders and spindly legs , crouched somberly at the plate ; Mel Ott 's right leg flicking out as he stepped into a fastball ; Ty Cobb 's spikes flashing high as he slid home . In the case of Frank Frisch , the " Fordham Flash , " the scenes are multiple-the headlong plunge toward second as he stretched a single into a double , the grace with which he consumed ground balls as an infielder , the temper tantrums that enthralled the crowds , baited the umpires and got him ejected from many games . <P> In his roles as player , coach , manager and even broadcaster , Frisch was one of those winning wild men who could make spectators believe that some great drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he died last week at 74 , five weeks after an auto crash near Elkton , Md. , he had been out of baseball for more than 16 years , but as far as addicts of the sport were concerned , he never really left . <P> Frisch broke in with the New York Giants in 1919 , fresh off the campus . A star at Fordham-he had captained the football , basketball and baseball teams-he sat on the bench only two months , then moved into the starting lineup when the regular second baseman hurt his leg . For the next 18 seasons , Frisch remained a regular , matching superb fielding with a lifetime batting average of .316 . From 1921 through 1924 , the Giants won four straight National League pennants , and Frisch starred in all four campaigns . <P> In 1926 , after a dispute with authoritarian Manager John McGraw , Frisch was traded to the Cardinals for another Hall of Fame second baseman , Rogers Hornsby . St. Louis fans were dismayed , but only temporarily . The Cardinals won pennants in 1928 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumphs . Then , as a playing manager , he oversaw the antics of the rambunctious Cardinal Gas House Gang . Frisch continued to play until 1937 . In one game that year , Fellow Cardinal Terry Moore nearly overtook him as both men sprinted around the bases . " When they start to climb up the back of the old Flash , " he said , " I know it 's time to quit . " <P> Frisch managed the Cardinals for one more year , then moved on to run the Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1940-46 ) and the Chicago Cubs ( 1949-51 ) . Between managing stints , he coached , then emerged as a play-by-play announcer for the Giants . His lament , " Oh , those bases on balls , " became a fan 's litany . After a 1956 heart attack , Frisch retired . He tended his azaleas , added to his collection of classical recordings and hurled steady disparagement at modern-day baseball . Samples : " Today 's spring-training camps are country clubs without dues . . . Baseball players today do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and snap have gone out of baseball . " Perhaps so , but never from Frankie Frisch.
