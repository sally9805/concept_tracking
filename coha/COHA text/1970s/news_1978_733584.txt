txt A Presidential commission recommended today a major overhaul of the military pension system , terming it " inefficient , " " inequitable " and too expensive . The nine-member panel , In a report to President Carter , said that the nation conid eventually save $10 billion a year by ending lifetime pensions for 20-year veterans and banning " double-dipping " by lieople who retire from the military and then take Government jobs . ' ' The current system tan no longer be justified , " said Charles J. Zwick , chaii -- ew York Times nan of the President 's Commission on Military Compensation . " It is unfair to too many people and has lost much of its credibility with the American people . " Under the recommendations , which face an uncertain Congressional reaction , members of the armed forces who leave the service after 20 years would have to wait until age 62 to collect a pension . Currently , people who retire as early as age 37 receive half their basic pay for life . ivil service Plan Cato. : At  --  the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active duty for a full 30-year career be eligible for a pension at the age of 55 , as in the Federal Civil Service . Retired people would draw pensions at about three-quarters of their highest active duty pay . President Carter , conceding that there are " some serious defects " in the military pension system , told the commission members at a meeting in the Oval Office this morning that he hoped to make proposals to Congress on the issue next January . He appointed the panel in March 1977 to study ways to tackle the rising and " almost uncontrollable " costs of military retirement pensions and other manpower expenditures in the defense establishment . Military inanpcox- , - mnctq are swallowing up an increasing share of the defense budget , and this year about half of the Defense Department 's outlay will go to pay for the 2.1 milllion servicemen , one million civilians , 850,000 reservists and 1.2 million retired persons on the Pentagon 's payroll . Pensions , which cost $1 billion a year // in 1964 and $10 billion today are expected to exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest-growing item in the manpower budget . Military pensions vary according to rank and years served . The annual retired pay of a colonel , for example . after 30 years of service is $24,030 . A master sergeant with 30 years in the Army , gets $11,605 . At issue , however , is the longevity of the pensions . According to the commission , a military officer who retires after 30 years , at the age of 53 , earns an aver4114e pension , enlarged by an allowance for inflation , whose lifetime value is 090,000 . A person in private industry who retires at age 62 receive ; a pension whose lifetime value is $135,000 . Only the most junior of today 's troops , those who have been in the armed forces for less than four years . and all those enlisting after the commission 's recommendations become effective would come under the new plan . Double-Dipping Opposed One of the commission 's key recommendations would allow veterans who work for the Government in civilian jobs to credit their military time toward a Civil Service pension but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , a practice known as'double-dipping . Another key proposal is designed to serve as an inducement to servicemen ' fo stay on active duty for at least 10 years . The panel urged the creation of a Government interest-earning trust fund to help former service members in their transition to civilian life . The fund , which can be withdrawn only in yearly or staggered installments , would provide " deferred compensation " to servicemen and enable them to draw money to buy a home or educate children . It would range from a low of $8,610 tor 10-year enlisted men to $140,890 for senior officers who stayed 30 years . Currently , veterans who leave the service before 20 years get nothing . System Called Unfair Mr. Zwick. who is president of the Southeast Banking Corporation of Miami , sad : " The current military compensation system is very expensive . It is unfair to a majority of the troops . It is ill-suited to manage a force of two million men and women in rapidly changing conditions . " It is unfair , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years of service and therefore receive no benefits at all . The new proposals would allow twice as many people to receive some benefits because payments would start for men and women who had completed 10 years of service . Mr. Zwick said . Although the report urged some increases in military allowances , Mr. Zwick said that the net effect would be to cut projected retirement costs by one-third , starting around the end of the century . ? Mr. Zwick added that if the current military pension system endured , costs would escalate to $100 billion in 40 years . " These awesome economic facts . plus ? relatively young people receiving retirement payments , have corroded the credibility of military retirement in the minds of many Americans " he said . The 207-page report provoked a strong dissent by one panel member , Benjamin 0 . Davis . a retired Air Force general . He termed the proposals " an un ? . varranted and unwise gamble with national security . " These changes would serve to make a military career so unattractive that the service would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a career force of the required size and quality , " he said .
