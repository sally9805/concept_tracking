COVER STORIES Man of the Year <P> Just a year ago , he was walking up to men and women who did not know he existed , shaking their hands and drawling , " I 'm Jimmy Carter , and I 'm going to be your next President . " The notion seemed preposterous , and most political professionals were dead sure he did not have a chance-but none of the voters laughed in his face . He was such an engaging man-a trifle shy , for all his gall , and there was that sunburst of a smile that people would always remember . Right from the start , he was perceived as being a rather different kind of politician compared with the rest of the field-as different in philosophy and tactics , it was to turn out , as in personal style . He not only knew what he wanted ; he also sensed , at least in the primary elections , what the American people wanted . <P> The result was something of a political miracle . <P> On Jan. 20 he will place his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , in the now familiar soft and even tones of south Georgia , Jimmy Carter , 52 , will take the oath that will make him-just as he was saying all along-the 39th President of the U.S. <P> After all that has been said and written about him during a long campaign , he is still an enigma to millions of Americans , including many who voted for him . He is complex and sometimes contradictory . His creed combines traditionally antithetical elements of help-the-deprived populism and deny-thyself fiscal conservatism . A Harris poll last month reported that 61% of those surveyed expect Carter to be a good or excellent President . Despite that hope , the people are waiting to be shown by Jimmy Carter , to see if he really has the wisdom and judgment and balance needed to succeed in the job that he so eagerly sought for two exhausting years . <P> There are many reasons why Carter 's rise stands as such a remarkable political feat . When he was walking the icy streets of New Hampshire last January , as many as 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . He occupied no political office ; his one term as Georgia 's Governor had ended in January 1975 , and state law kept him from running again . He was the typical outsider , and it was an axiom of politics that outsiders-particularly those from the South-went nowhere nationally . <P> All the axioms were demolished by Carter 's flinty will power , his almost arrogant self-confidence , his instinct to ask his listeners to " trust me " and his fetching promise to give them " a Government as good and as competent and as compassionate as are the American people . " The talk about trust and love sounded too vague to many . But he was a candidate of the 1970s , and he knew that the voters were more concerned about the overriding issue of moral leadership than about the big-spending liberal programs of the 1960s . He did more than just defeat a dozen other Democrats , most of them Senators and Governors who were better known and had bigger power bases . He also destroyed forever the hopes of Alabama 's George Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet of a would-be assassin . By showing that a nonracist Southerner could win a major party nomination , Carter gave new pride to his region and went far to heal ancient wounds . <P> The triumphs of spring nearly turned into defeat in the fall .
