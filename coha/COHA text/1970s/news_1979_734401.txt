txt From the halls of world diplomacy to the mean streets of the city , Pope John Paul II swept through New York yesterday , preaching peace and pausing beyond the cheering crowds at hamlets of the striving and the poor . Beginning the second stop on his weeklong visit to the United States , the Pope , waving gently from his motorcade , moved quickly from one part of the city to another . His hands whisked forth blessings and he nodded hello in delight at crowds that shouted his name in rhymes and ethnic salutes and rushed from police barricades to TV screens to track his travels . The Pope opened his visit with an hourlong address to the United Nations GenToday 's papal itinerary , page B2. eral Assembly shortly after flying to La Guardia Airport from Boston . Facing the world 's diplomats in his shimmering white cassock and skullcap , he carefully delineated a case for world peace as rooted in individual justice . He stressed concern for human rights and the arms race , and drew considerable attention with a plea for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my greetings to all the men and women living on this planet , " the Pope declared before heading back out in his motorcade , which bristled with clergy and security men . His voice still deep and strong , the Pontiff ended the first of his two whirlwind days here on an emotional , liturgical theme at a solemn evening mass for 80,000 people at Yankee Stadium . Harlem and Bronx Visited In between , the Pontiff headed for a Roman Catholic parish in Harlem and then a housing rehabilitation project in the symptomatic heart of the nation 's blighted cities , the South Bronx . " Do not abandon yourselves to despair , " the Pope told a gathering of poor people in the South Bronx . And later , at the Yankee Stadium mass for a predominantly middle-class throng , he described the poor as " your brothers and sisters . " " You must never be content to leave them just the crumbs from the feast , " the Pope said in his homily . The crowd listened so quietly that an elevated subway train could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was decked with papal , not baseball , pennants . The Pope 's cadences echoed from a large red-carpeted altar after he arrived triumphally , waving from the back of a white , customized truck . Photographers ' lights flashed like // gem flecks in the crowd as he passed in a grand flourish . Even some city policemen , white-gloved for the occasion , could be seen turning to applaud him . The Pope seemed more animated than at any time in the evening as he delivered his message at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Harlem . " We are the Easter people , and hallelujah is our song , " he said . In the neighborhood stops , he carried forth a theme he had presented on a more intellectual scale to the 4,000 dignitaries and diplomats who heard him at the United Nations . There he had praised the strength that comes of community and had condemned " the abyss separating the minority of the excessively rich from the multitude of the destitute . " Glimpses of this abyss could be had by many of the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishes to the Bronx ball park . It brimmed over with stadium light and with the song and ceremony of the Roman Catholic mass and its message that God exists and actually came to earth and prevailed in His own resurrection . Kisses for Schoolchildren The Pope paused on his way into the General Assembly chamber to chat and kiss some schoolchildren ? children of United Nations personnel ? in the flower garden . At various points in the day , the Pope paid similar attention to other youngsters and seemed to refresh his spirit in their company even more than with the crowded lines of politicians and church officials who sought his attention . Security was as tight as possible , and some of the admirers who got close to the Pope tried to engage his attention personally across the fidgety glances of security personnel . One , Marian Babcock , a member of the United Nations field service staff , offered him a single red rose and then knelt and beamed at his personal blessing . As if mindful of the special scrutiny he is receiving from American feminists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his staff workers at their 38th-floor offices and said : " I see you have many ladies . " He added that this was " good for peace . " Mr. Waldheim hardly demurred , and the Pope concluded , " It is a good sign that we have more ladies than men . " A Mingling of Responses The city at large stayed attuned to the Pope even as its business day went on . The reactions were as varied as New York 's special interests , with political nuances as well as religious spirit in the air . Mary Ziminski came down at 4 A.M. from New Britain , Conn. , and was happy to stand for eight straight hours on First Avenue for two waving glimpses of " this man of courage who will not stay caged , who wants to show the world how to stand on its feet . " At the same time two staff diplomats who identified themselves as a Palestinian and a Lebanese crammed into a United Nations corridor after the Pope 's hour-long address to shout " Aash El Papa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passed by . The papal message had singled out Palestinian rights for favorable attention . Cheers From Near and Far Students gathered near 20 East 72d Street , the residence of Archbishop Giovanni Chen , the Vatican 's Permanent Observer to the United Nations . As the Pope arrived for lunch , the students shouted : " Long Live the Pope ! " The 59-year-old world traveler , ignoring the tyranny of his tight schedule , paused and smiled . The faith of some in the crowds was visible on First Avenue near 44th Street in the form of baggage left trustingly on the sidewalk by 130 schoolgirls who were crammed over a police barricade , waiting for the Pope . The girls had traveled 18 straight hours on a bus from Illinois . Their teacher at Willis Academy in Glen Cove , Karen Johnson , explained : " We 're just trusting the honesty of New Yorkers not to take our things - This was the second time a Pope had visited the city , and John Paul II commemorated the fact when he repeated for the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paul VI , before the United Nations : " No more war ! " There is no full accounting of the massive detail of the Pope 's day , the second of his national visit , which is to include six cities and end this weekend with a visit to the White House . Before he sees the President , the Pontiff will visit Philadelphia this afternoon , then Des Moines and Chicago . Yesterday began with an early farewell to Boston , the first stop . The Pope 's plane , a Trans World Airlines jetliner designated Shepherd I , touched down at La Guardia Airport and taxied to a welcoming committee packed with smiling prelates and politicians . Governors Carey and Byrne , Mayor Koch and others went forth to greet the Pope , - but only Secretary General Waldheim spoke . " You have spared no effort to bring the message of peace to all parts of the world , " he said as the sun , shining through a hazy sky , warmed the Pope 's back and the crowd 's faces . The motorcade began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyone but watching police officers along the Grand Central Parkway . But as it headed across the Triborough Bridge and down the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive , the city took better shape at the first sighting of ordinary people on their day 's routine ? a jogger , for one , plodding by in the other direction . The Pope looked out , flanked by his host prelates , Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York and Bishop Francis J. Mugavero of Brooklyn . Mayor Koch was not in the motorcade , but he managed to get the attention of news reporters by taking notes on John Paul II at the airport and feeding the world a tourist-Pope quote : " I shall be a good citizen . " At the United Nations , delegates awaiting the Pope could be seen studying the special visitors ' gallery , which included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , Happy Rockefeller , Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jacob K. Javits , and W. Avereil Harriman , the longtime diplomat and Presidential troubleshooter . Some delegates fidgeted . A Soviet diplomat took a picture of the Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope spoke of those abused by nations in the name of " internal security . " An Israeli diplomat took note after note , then tore them up after the speech . The Pope , who has made a point of using English in all his American stops , put great effort into the articulation of his speech , and he came across clearly , with pronunciation slips on a few troublesome words ? " hegemony , " for example . In the afternoon the Pope went to St. Patrick 's Cathedral to give an apostolic blessing and to pray with an invited crowd of proud members and prominent Catholics who were pandemonium-close to their spiritual leader . Trailing the Pontiff The street crowds were not of the massive proportions that some had predicted , but they seemed fervent . " All our hope is in the Pope " said the banner of Rosemary Donovan of Chicago , who said she was in a group that planned to journey to Phildelphia today and then home to Chicago to glimpse the Pope along the way . The crowd inside and outside St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the afternoon . People were packed building to building in the side streets . The Pope greeted them from the cathedral landing , dashing holy water at them , waving in his familiar palmsup gesture of supplication as much as affection . Security agents cleared hanging tree branches as the Pope walked near the crowd , and they roared and waved at his attention . Soon after , the Pope knelt quietly in front of the main altar , watched by the throng that crammed the cathedral as he prayed before heading uptown . The Pope rode much of the lengthy route from St. Patrick 's to St. Charles Borromeo Church standing up , his scarlet cape billowing in the wind as he waved . On 141st Street , many people watched from the windows , as he arrived about half an hour behind schedule , at 6:35 P.M. He stood for a moment , waving and smiling , and then got out of his car and stepped up onto a platform .                  @ @ @
