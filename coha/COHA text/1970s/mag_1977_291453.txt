Harried by hair loss ? If you are a healthy male , there is really no cure for a balding pate , except a toupee or a hair transplant . Caught a cold ? Forget about those nostrums plugged on TV , unless you want to toss your money away . Stymied by a sex problem ? Your trouble is probably psychological , because the bedroom is only a microcosm of the outside world 's stresses and strains . <P> These bits of blunt advice are not delivered by a kindly country doctor but by an unusual new medical guide for lay people . Unlike most other books in this proliferating genre , Symptoms : The Complete Home Medical Encyclopedia ( Thomas Y. Crowell ; $17.95 ) helps the medically untutored diagnose an illness as the professionals do : by its symptoms . <P> For someone seeking advice about what to do for an ache , for example , or who is secretly worried about occasional bowel bleeding or vague chest discomfort , the search through a standard handbook may produce more anxiety than the malady ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with symptoms that match his complaint . Symptoms adroitly solves that difficulty . It catalogues not only diseases but , in a separate section , their symptoms as well . Thus if the reader has , say , a swelling in his leg , he simply looks in the table of symptoms under the heading " Bones , Joints , Muscles and Extremities . " There he finds a listing for swollen leg . It tells him that the problem may be , among other things , phlebitis , a painful swelling often characterized by whitened skin and a prominent vein . <P> Whisky for Pain . If the reader wants to know still more , he turns to the phlebitis entry in the diseases section of the book . There he learns that the disorder may be due to a clot in the outer veins of the thigh or leg ; that his feet should be raised in bed ; that whisky may ease the pain ; and that doctors - whom he should consult posthaste-usually advise anticoagulants or surgery . In all , the book lists more than 650 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zenker 's diverticulum , an unnatural pouch that sometimes develops in the esophagus of elderly people . <P> Symptoms is the handiwork of 20 leading specialists in different areas of medicine . In spite of the collegial authorship , Editor Sigmund Stephen Miller has managed to maintain a refreshingly wry tone . For example , in discussing nutrition , he notes that " sad to say , more organic food is sold than grown . " Stressing preventive medicine , which is frequently neglected , he condemns smoking , prescribes liquor only in moderation and cries fowl ( as well as fish ) to saturated-fat-laden beef . <P> While emphasizing the need to see a physician , given certain symptoms , the handbook also stresses that too much doctoring is as bad as too little : " If the disease is comparatively minor , and the symptoms are minor , it is better to try to get by without medication . " Above all , it makes a strong pitch for physical fitness , endorsing everything from swimming to sex : " The body is far more likely to rust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better it will function . " The same might be said of Symptoms .
