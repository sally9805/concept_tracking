For the fifth year in a row , Khmer Rouge insurgents have mounted a dry-season offensive against the Cambodian capital of Phnom-Penh , strangling the city and blocking its vital Mekong River supply line . Once again there are widespread predictions that Phnom-Penh is on the verge of collapse-and with it , the U.S.-backed government of ailing President Lon Nol . Whether or not it falls , there is no question that the situation is more desperate than ever before . The Cambodian forces have already exhausted the $275 million in U.S. military aid they were granted this year and have scant hope of getting the additional $222 million President Ford is asking Congress to authorize ( see box next page ) . Meanwhile , as the threat of starvation increased throughout the capital , the U.S. stepped up a civilian airlift of ammunition and food into Phnom-Penh from neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . <P> Even though Phnom-Penh was subjected to daily rocket attacks last week , the Lon Nol government seemed blindly optimistic about holding out , apparently convinced that the U.S. will somehow pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Along the Mekong River , the government 's position has steadily deteriorated . Instead of regaining some of the strategic river positions , as they had planned , loyalist troops have lost much of the ground they retook in late January and in the process have suffered heavy casualties . Some battalions were wiped out completely . Others returned with as few as a dozen men in good condition ; the rest were killed , wounded or captured . Reports filtered into the capital of remnants of three battalions , totaling 400 or 500 men , who surrendered en masse to the Khmer Rouge . Their action raises the suggestion that if things get much worse , large numbers of government troops might be tempted to surrender , vanish or defect to the other side . <P> Smashing Chinese Faces . Part of the government 's dilemma is that it lacks the troops to defend Phnom-Penh and at the same time reopen the Mekong , a critical problem that would not be solved by the receipt of more military-aid funds from the U.S. Cambodian forces around the capital are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of a division in that area during this year 's fighting . The high command feels it should not risk taking any soldiers away from Phnom-Penh ; yet the river must be reopened to convoys , or the capital will eventually be lost anyway . <P> In the remaining government-controlled zones of Cambodia , the morale of the civilian population has never been lower . At the provincial capital of Battambang , for instance , students protesting the rising price of rice rioted for two days against the Chinese population , which forms the bulk of the merchant class and is an easy scapegoat . When 20 of their number were then arrested in a military crackdown , the students seized an airport commander and held him until Premier Long Beret flew over from Phnom-Penh and worked out a mutual release . By week 's end the anti-Chinese feeling seemed to be spreading to the capital , where crowds of students gathered on street corners-waiting , as one described it , " for a Chinese face to smash . " The rebellious mood could turn against the government , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corruption .
