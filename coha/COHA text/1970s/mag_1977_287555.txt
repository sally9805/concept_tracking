With the downfall of Yitzhak Rabin and the emergence of Shimon Peres as leader of the Labor Party , Israeli citizens have been deprived of their favorite blood sport : the ferocious , nonstop struggle for power and prestige between their Premier and their Defense Minister . For the past three years virtually every Israeli domestic , foreign and military policy issue has engaged the two contestants in loud public attacks and counterattacks , which occasionally subside into sotto voce snarling and low-key muttering . <P> The dispute between the two men has often been more a matter of style than substance . Dour and woefully inarticulate , Rabin has frequently been outshone by Peres , 53 , an elegant , personable and cultivated man of the world , whose eloquence is legendary in Israel . Though sometimes dismissed by U.S. diplomats as a lightweight , Peres is in fact a hardheaded , pragmatic and dedicated statesman . Not even his worst enemies would begrudge him credit for his critical contribution to Israel 's formidable defense establishment . <P> Born in Poland , Peres was taken to Palestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the Haganah , the famed underground Jewish self-defense organization . In his early 20s , he persuaded the Histadrut youth movement to support David Ben-Gurion . The statesman soon began to groom Peres for a political career . Wearying of desk jobs in the newly established Ministry of Defense , Peres took off for a brief vacation in the U.S. in 1950 . He learned English in three months and took advanced courses in philosophy and economics at New York City 's New School for Social Research , New York University and Harvard . <P> When Peres , at 29 , returned to Israel in 1952 , Premier Ben-Gurion appointed him to top posts in the Defense Ministry . For the next 13 years , he played the key role in organizing the Israeli Defense Forces , developed the nation 's arms industry and nuclear-research program . He traveled abroad constantly to purchase arms and conduct delicate military negotiations . Peres quickly acquired a reputation as a canny , effective and realistic bargainer . His great coup came in 1955 , when he brought off the Franco-Israeli military alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made possible the Israeli victories in 1956 and 1967 . <P> Later elected to the Knesset under Ben-Gurion 's patronage , Peres built a political power base that reinforced his strong position among the military . Still , in 1965 he made enemies by joining Ben-Gurion in a group opposing the government of then Premier Levi Eshkol . Not until 1968 was Peres ' faction reintegrated into the Labor Party . Subsequently Peres began broadening his expertise . He held such diverse jobs as Minister for Economic Development of Occupied Territories , Immigration , Transport and Communications and Information . When he lost a close race to Rabin for the premiership in 1974 , Peres accepted the post of Defense Minister in his rival 's Cabinet . <P> -
