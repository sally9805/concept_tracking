txt Little-noticed strikes in cities across the United States are tying up billions of dollars worth of building projects and idling thousands of construction workers . At the heart of the disputes : demands by contractors  --  and now some labor leaders  --  that soaring construction costs be brought under control . Union leaders see the survival of the con- , struction crafts at stake . They say rising costs and restrictive work rules are driving an increasing number of builders to nonunion workers . Builders using nonunion labor underbid unionized contractors time after time , they complain , thus keeping union members out of work . ? In New York construction unions with some 65,000 working members struck last weekend in a contract dispute that threatens to tie up $2 billion worth of building projects . ? In Chicago , 70,000 building trades unionists have been idled by a strike and em- ployer lockout that shut down nearly $3 billion in construction work since June 23 . ? Across the country , local unions of elevator constructors have been on strike in many cities for three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . The contract disputes revolve around union demands for wage increases that exceed the present Phase 2 guideline of 5.5 percent a year and contractors ' demands for revisions of traditional work rules that determine how , when , and where the construction crafts shall perform their jobs . Martin J. Ward , president of the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union , recently urged his 225,000 members to ease up on restrictions and to assure their employers " a fair day 's work for a fair day 's pay . " He wrote in his union 's magazine , " The trend toward nonunion construction is no longer a future threat , it is a present reality . " Trend spreads from South Mr. Ward said nearly $1 billion of new construction went to open-shop ( nonunion ) contractors in one week recently . All together , the AFL-CIO building-trades unions estimate that unionized employers lost more than $10 billion in contracts over the past three or four years . The National Constructors Association , an employer group , has estimated that 32 percent of all construction outlays in 1971 where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Southwest , and originally centered in suburban and rural areas . For decades ' most crafts concentrated on unionizing building tradesmen in the cities . They paid little attention to harder-to-reach workers in the suburbs and outlying areas . Now the movement of industrial and commercial construction out of the cities is opening new opportunities for nonunion contractors  --  and high unemployment in many crafts is making union workers more willing to accept " temporary " employment on nonunion terms . // * Construction tied in knots // However , today 's nonunion operations are not limited to outlying areas . Increasingly they are also found in the big cities . Even in New York , one of the most tightly unionized cities in the construction industry , nonunion operations are now firmly established in construction repair and maintenance . Top union urges fewer demands National building-trades unions are now urging locals to be less demanding and more receptive when rules changes are brought up by contractors at bargaining tables . But in construction , the national unions lack the influence that the big industrial unions have over locals : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only urge , not enforce , moderate bargaining policies . In Chicago in negotiations affecting three heavily industrial counties , locals of carpenters and cement masons either are on strike or locked out in a contract dispute with 14 contractor associations . The- carpenters strike there is the union 's first in Chicago in 53 years . Cement masons in the Chicago area also were out over rules issues  --  one a contractor demand that workers allow lunch periods to be scheduled flexibly between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m . Now lunch periods are set inflexibly at 12 noon and concrete pouring that is frequently under way then must be completed with double pay after 12 o'clock . The cement masons tentatively accepted a 53-cent-an-hour pay increase , roughly 5.5 percent , but they have been admanatly against changes in rules . Work-rule issues In New York construction unions tnat struck when contracts ran out June 30 want increases of from 10 percent to 15 percent , but work-rules changes and other issues are equally important . Two of 22 unions with contracts with the Building Trades Employers Association settled during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenders settled for 50 cents an hour in each of three yeirs of the new agreement , plasterers for 90 cents an hour the first year , $1 the second and $1.10 the third .
