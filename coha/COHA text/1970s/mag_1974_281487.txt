When the Japanese government announced in 1963 that it planned to build a nuclear-powered ship , there was widespread criticism . Memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were much too vivid for the Japanese people to accept even peaceful applications of atomic energy . <P> But the government went ahead , insisting that there would be no danger . In 1971 the $21 million , 8,214-ton freighter Mutsu , named for its home port in northern Japan , slid down the ways-and into trouble . <P> First local fishermen , fearing that radioactive discharges from the freighter would contaminate their rich scallop fishing grounds , pressured authorities to keep the ship in its berth for 22 months . Then two weeks ago , the Mutsu was ordered to go on its test run . Shouting " Shinde shimae Drop dead ! " <P> at the ship 's crew , the fishermen set up a massive blockade of fishing boats to stop the freighter from leaving port . <P> Finally , after sneaking the Mutsu out to sea late one night last week , the ship 's engineers turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propeller once , alarms sounded . The reactor shields were leaking minute amounts of radioactivity . <P> The government embarrassedly ordered the Mutsu to make repairs at sea . Technicians first smeared a paste of rice and boron ( an element that absorbs neutrons ) over the shields without success . Next polyethylene shields were dispatched from shore that should stop the leak . Meantime , the fishermen vowed to form a barricade of boats to bar the freighter from its home port . Other Japanese cities are no more anxious to receive it . At week 's end critics were saying that the Mutsu should become the world 's first nuclear Flying Dutchman , condemned to sail ceaselessly without ever putting in to land .
