The television setting is " Scoops ' Place , " a rundown drugstore in the inner city . A young soda jerk named K.O.K. spoons out free banana splits to two buddies who stroll in . Boss " Scoops " calls the boy aside and points out that , although he makes only $1 per hour , K.O.K. has just spent $6 on ice cream for his friends . " Son , " says Scoops in a fatherly fashion , " you 're supposed to make $4 today . Now you 've got ta work two more hours just to get back to zero . " Blurts out the incredulous K.O.K. : " Oh , man , hey , I did n't even know there was a below zero . Man , I 'm in worse shape than if I did n't have nothin ' at all . " <P> K.O.K. has just learned about negative numbers . His experience is shared by elementary school children who-three times a week in Boston and four in Los Angeles-watch a new show , Infinity Factory , on their TV sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach youngsters a mathematical concept , holding their attention with lively gimmicks that are reminiscent of those on Laugh-In and Sesame Street . <P> Fear of Math . Factory is the idea of Jerrold Zacharias , professor emeritus of physics at M.I.T. and the inventor of civilization 's most precise timepiece : the atomic clock . Zacharias has long been concerned about what he calls " mathophobia , " a widespread fear of math among school children , especially minority students . Black children , according to a 1975 report by the Education Commission of the States , score 14% below the national norm on math tests at age 9 , 21% below by age 17 . <P> Determined to make math less formidable , Zacharias in 1974 assembled a team of educators at the Educational Development Center in Newton , Mass . With the help of a $4 million grant from the U.S. Office of Education , the group created a series of 65 TV programs aimed at eight- to eleven-year-olds-the age at which interest in math first begins to wane . Zacharias and his co-workers isolated five mathematical concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaling , estimating , measurement , decimals and graphs . Then the team planned Factory episodes that focus on each of these problem areas . <P> The show , produced by Film Maker Jesus Salvadore Trevio , tears along at a breakneck pace to the beat of finger-snapping rock music . Regular features include a spin-off of the Laugh-In cocktail party . Kids dance frantically to music ; when it stops , everybody freezes while the camera zooms in on one child , who asks : " What 's eight times seven ? " The music resumes , then stops , and another child shouts " Fifty-six . " In " The Brownstones , " another Laugh-In-like skit , children lean out of apartment-house windows singing and joking .
