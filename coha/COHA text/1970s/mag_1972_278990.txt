Bobby Jones once observed that nobody really wins a major golf tournament ; someone always loses it . Indeed the salient feature of last week 's British Open was not so much Lee Trevino 's narrow victory , but Jack Nicklaus ' slender loss . Nicklaus had already won the Masters at Augusta , Ga. , and the U.S. Open and had set his sights on this tournament and the upcoming P.G.A . in a bid for an unprecedented grand slam of professional golf . <P> He came incredibly close in what was likely the most dramatic finish in golf history . Nicklaus went into the closing round on Scotland 's sun-sluiced Muirfield course a full six strokes behind Defending Champion Trevino and five behind Britain 's dogged Tony Jacklin . Trevino had blistered the parched fairways at the finish of the third round with birdies on the final five holes for a 66 , which tied the course record and put him one stroke ahead of Jacklin . Nicklaus , playing what was for him desultory golf , needed birdies on two of the final three holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The final round was something else again . Nicklaus birdied six of the first eleven holes , while Trevino and Jacklin played fitful golf . By the ninth hole big Jack had caught the leaders . But on the 17th Trevino pulled off a spectacular shot . Perched on an awkward angle off the green , Trevino lofted a 30-ft. chip that rolled into the cup to save a par . Nicklaus had bogeyed the 16th , Jacklin bogeyed both of the final holes , and the Merry Mexican , crying , " I 'm the greatest chipper in the world ! " , became the first golfer since Arnold Palmer ( 1961-62 ) to win two straight British Opens . Although Nicklaus lost his glorious quest , Bobby Jones would agree that , on the bonnie Muirfield moors , both he and Trevino struck resonant tunes of glory .
