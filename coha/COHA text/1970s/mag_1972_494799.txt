Fallaci : I wonder what your feelings are , these last few days , Dr. Kissinger . I wonder if you too are disappointed , like us , like most of the world . Are you disappointed , Dr. Kissinger ? Kissinger : Disappointed ? Why ? What has happened , within the last few days , to disappoint me ? Q : Something unpleasant , Dr. Kissinger : although you said that peace was " within reach , " and although you confirmed that an agreement with the North Vietnamese had been drawn up , peace has not come . The war goes on as before , and worse than before . A : There will be peace . We 're determined to obtain it and we shall have it . It will come within a few weeks or even less , i.e. immediately following the resumption of tiegotiations with the North Vietnamese for the final agreement . This is what I said ten days ago and I re ? peat it . Yes , we 'll have peace within a reasonable pe ? riod if Hanoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define the details , and if they accept it in the same spirit and with the same attitude adopted in October . Those " ifs " are the only uncertainty of the last few , days . An uncertainty , how ? ever , that I refuse even to consider ; you are giving in to panic , and one should n't panic in cases like this . Nor succumb to impatience . The fact is that . . . Well , we 've been conducting these negotiations for months , and you newspaper people would n't take them seri ? ously . You kept on saying they would n't end in any ? thing concrete . Then , suddenly , you proclaimed that peace was already around the corner , and now , finally , you say the negotiations have failed . That way you take our temperature every day , four times a day . But you take it from Hanoi 's point of view . And . . . please take note , I understand Hanoi 's point of view . The North Vietnamese wanted us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unreasonable at the same time and . . . No , I do n't want to engage in polemics on this subject . Q : But had you actually engaged to sign on October 31 ? A : I say and repeat that they were the ones who in ? sisted on this date and that , to avoid an abstract de ? bate about dates that seemed in fact merely theoretical at the time , we replied that we 'd make every effort to conclude the negotiations within October 31 . But it was always clear , to us at least , that we would n't be able to sign an agreement until the last details had been discussed . We could n't be expected to respect a date merely because , in good faith , we had promised to exert every effort to do so . So where does that put us ? At the point where those details still need to be discussed and a further meeting is indispensable . They say it is n't indispensable , that it is n't even neces ? sary . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will take place as soon as the North Vietnam ? ese summon me to Paris . But this is only November 4 , today is November 4 , and I can quite understand the North Vietnamese not wishing to resume negotiations just a few days after the date on which they had asked us to sign . I can understand this adjournment on their part . But it is n't conceivable , to me at least , that they should refuse to agree to a further meeting . Especially now , when we have already covered ninety percent of the road and are near our destination . No , I 'm not dis ? appointed . I should be , certainly , were Hanoi to break the agreement , were Hanoi to refuse to discuss any alterations . But , no , I ca n't believe it . I ca n't even sus ? pect that we 've come so far only to fail on a matter of prestige , of procedures , of dates , of nuances . Q : . And yet , it looks as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverted to a harsh vocabulary , they 've proffered serious , almost insulting charges against you .. . A : Oh , that does n't mean a thing . It 's happened be ? fore and we 've never paid any attention . I 'd say that serious charges , even insults , are part of a normal pic ? ture . Essentially , nothing has changed . Since Tuesday October 31 , since , that is , we 've calmed down here , you keep on asking me whether the patient is ill . But I can discover no illness . And I really believe things will fall out more or less as I claim . Peace , I repeat , will come within a matter of weeks after talks are resumed ; 18 not within a matter of months . Within a matter Of weeks . Q : But when will talks be resumed ? That 's the point . A : Whenever Le Duc Tho wants to meet me . I 'm here , waiting . But without any anxiety , believe me . For God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between each meeting ! I do n't see why we should get the wind up now if we have to wait a few days . The only reason for the nervous tension that has seized you all is that people are wondering : " Will talks really be resumed ? " When you were cynical and did n't be ? lieve anything would happen , you did n't notice time passing . You were over-pessimistic at the beginning , and over-optimistic after my press conference , and now you 're over-pessimistic again . You refuse to real ? ize that everything is proceeding as I always thought it would from the moment I declared that peace was at hand . I calculated it would take a couple of weeks then , if I 'm not mistaken . But even if it were to take more . . . Enough , I do n't want to talk of Vietnam any more . I ca n't afford to at the present time . Every word I utter makes the headlines . At the end of November , perhaps . . . Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November ? Q : Because it 's more interesting now , Dr. Kissinger . Be ? cause Thieu , for instance , defied you to talk . Please read this cutting from The New York Times . It carries Thieu 's words : " Why do n't you ask Kissinger what issues we differ on , what points I refuse to accept ? " A : Let me see it . .. Oh ! No , I sha n't answer him . I sha n't respond to his invitation . Q : He 's already given his own answer , Dr. Kissinger . He 's already told the world that the disagreement stems from the fact that , according to the terms accepted by you , the North Vietnamese troops will remain in South Viet ? nam . Dr. Kissinger , do you believe you 'll ever be able to win over Thieu ? Do you think the United States will be compelled to sign a separate treaty with Hanoi ? A : Do n't ask me that . I have to stick to what I said in public ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hypothesis that I do n't believe will materialize , a hy ? pothesis that must not materialize . All I can tell you is that we are determined to make peace , and that we will make it within as short a delay as possible , after my next meeting with Le Duc Tho . Thieu may say what he likes . It 's his business . Q : Dr. Kissinger , if I put a pistol to your head and en ? joined you to choose between a dinner with Thieu and a dinner with Le Duc Tho . . . which would you choose ? A : That 's a question I ca n't answer . Q : What if I were to answer it saying I like to think you THE NEW REPUBLIC would prefer to dine with Le Duc Tho ? A : I ca n't , I ca n't . . . I do n't want to answer that question . Q : Can you answer this question then : did you like Le Duc ' Tho ? A : Yes . I found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , very strong , and always courteous , well-bred . Sometimes , too , very hard , difficult to come to terms with , in fact . But this is something I 've always respected in him . Yes , I feel great respect for Le Duc Tho . Of course , we met on strictly professional terms , but I believe , I believe I could feel a certain softening in the background . It 's a fact , for instance , that at times we even managed to crack a joke together . We said that one day I might go to lecture on international relations at Hanoi University and that he would come to Har ? vard to lecture on Marxism-Leninism . Well , I should say our rapport was good . Q : Would you say the same of Thieu ? A : I had a good rapport with Thieu too , at first . Q : Exactly , at first . The South Vietnamese said this time you did n't greet each other like the best of friends . A : What did they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Kissinger ? A : Well of course we had and still have our own points of view , and not necessarily the same points of view . Let 's say Thieu and I greeted each other like allies . Q : Dr. Kissinger , it is now obvious that Thieu is a harder nut to crack than formerly thought . As regards Thieu , do you feel you 've achieved as much as you could or do you still hope to do something more ? In one word : are you optimistic as regards the Thieu problem ? ? A : Yes , I do feel optimistic ! I 've still got something to do ! Lots to do ! I have by no means finished , we have by ' no means finished ! And I do n't feel powerless . I do n't feel discouraged . Not at all . I feel prepared , con ? fident . Optimistic . Even if I ca n't speak of Thieu , even if I ca n't tell you what we 're doing at this point in the negotiations , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my ability to tie everything up within the delay I 've mentioned . That 's why it 's useless for Thieu to ask you journalists to make me list the points we disagree about . It 's so useless that his plea does n't even irritate me . Besides , I 'm not one of those people that allow themselves to be swayed by their emotions . Emotions are of no use . Least of all are they of any use in helping one to attain peace . Q : But the dying , those that may die , are in a hurry , Dr. Kissinger . There was a dreadful picture in this morning 's DECEMBER 16 , 1972 papers : a picture of a very young Vietcong who died two days after October 31 . There was also a horrifying news item : about the twenty-two Americans shot down in their helicopter by a Vietcong grenade three days after October 31 . And while you condemn haste , the American Depart ? ment of Defense is sending fresh arms and munitions to Thieu . Hanoi is doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens before a cease-fire . Do n't you remember the maneuvers in the Middle East at the time of the cease-fire ? They lasted for two years , to say the least . You know , the fact-that we 're sending Saigon arms and that Hanoi is sending arms to the North Vietnamese quartered in South Viet ? nam means nothing . Nothing . Nothing . And do n't make me talk of Vietnam any more , please . Q : Wo n't you even talk of the fact that , according to some , the agreement you and Nixon have accepted is , to all prac ? tical purposes , an act of surrender to Hanoi ? A : That 's absurd ! It 's absurd to say that President Nixon , a President who , towards the Soviet Union and Communist China , and on the eve of his own election has taken up a stance of assistance and defense as regards South Vietnam against what he considered a North Vietnamese invasion . . . it 's absurd to think that such a President could surrender to Hanoi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done is not a surrender . What we have done is give South Vietnam an opportunity to survive under conditions that are , today , political rather than military . It is now up to the South Vietnamese to win the political con ? test awaiting them , as we have always maintained . If you compare the agreement we have accepted with our proposals of May 8 last , you will see that it 's almost the same thing . There are no great differences between what we proposed last May and what the draft of the accepted ' agreement contains . We have n't added new clauses , we have n't made new concessions . I totally and absolutely reject the opinion of a " sur ? render . " But that 's really enough about Vietnam now . Let 's talk of Machiavelli , Cicero , anything except Vietnam . Q : Let 's talk of war , Dr. Kissinger . You 're not a pacifist , are you ? A : No , I really do n't think I am . Even if I respect gen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and espe ? cially with half-and-half pacifists : you know , those that are pacifists one way and anything but the other . The only pacifists I agree to talk to are those that bear the consequences of non-violence right to the end : but even to them I talk willingly merely to tell them that they will be crushed by the will of those that are strong and that their pacifism can lead to nothing but hor ? rible suffering . War is not an abstraction : it 's something depending on prevailing conditions . The war against 19 Hitler , for instance , was a necessary one . By that I do n't mean that war is necessary as such , that nations have to wage war to preserve their virility . What I mean is that there are certain principles for which nations must be ready to fight . Q : And what can you tell me about the war in Vietnam , Dr. Kissinger ? You have never been against it , have you ? A : How could I be ? Even before I occupied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been against the war in Vietnam . Q : But do n't you think Arthur Schlesinger is right when he says that all the war in Vietnam has managed to prove is that half a million Americans , with all their technology , were unable to defeat poorly armed men dressed in black pajamas ? A : That 's a different problem . If it is a problem whether the war in Vietnam was necessary , a just war , rather than . . . Opinions of that kind depend on the position one takes up when the country is already caught up in the war and all there remains is to devise a method to extricate it . After all , my , our part has been to reduce increasingly America 's involvement in the war , and then terminate the war . Eventually , history will judge who achieved most : whether those who merely criti ? cized or we who tried to reduce the war and then ended it . Yes , judgment belongs to posterity . When a country is involved in a war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop to it . One must end it wisely . And that 's very different from stating that we were right to start the war . Q : But , Dr. Kissinger , do n't you think it was a useless war ? A : I may agree . But do n't forget the reason why we started tfit war was to prevent the North gobbling up the South , to enable the South to hold on to its terri ? tory . Of course , by that I do n't , mean that we had no other aim ; it was something more as well . But today I am not in a position to judge whether the war in Viet ? nam was a just one or not , whether it was useful or useless for us to become involved in it . But are we still talking of Vietnam ? Q : Yes , and , still concerning Vietnam , do you think you might say that these negotiations have been and are the most important undertaking in your career , or even in your life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most painful . But maybe it is n't right to describe them as the most difficult undertaking : it is more accurate to say that they have been the most painful undertaking . Because they ievolved me emotionally . You see , ap ? proaching China was a difficult task from an intellec ? tual point of view , but not emotionally difficult . Peace in Vietnam , on the other hand , has been an emotion 20 ally difficult task . As for describing those negotiations as the most important thing I 've ever done . . . No , what I wanted to achieve was n't merely peace in Vietnam : it was three things . This agreement , the rapprochement with China and a new relationship with the Soviet Union . I have always attached great importance to the problem of a new relationship with the Soviet Union . No less , I might say , than to the rapprochement with China and the end of the war in Vietnam . Q : And you 've done it . You succeeded with China , you succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , at this point , Dr. Kissinger , I 'll ask you the same question I asked the astronauts when they were fly ? ing to the Moon : " What next ? What will you do after the Moon , what more can you do than your astronaut 's job ? " A : Oh ! And what did the astronauts answer ? Q : The question bewildered them , and they answered : " We 'll see . . . I do n't know . " A : Neither do I. I really do n't know what I 'll do after ? wards . However , unlike the astronauts , I 'm not be ? wildered . I 've always found so many things to do in life and I 'm certain that when I leave this job .. . Of course , I 'll need some time to recuperate , a decom ? pression period ; one ca n't be in the position I now occupy , then leave it and begin something else at once . However , once decompressed , I 'm certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it now . It could influence my . . . my work . We are liv ? ing in such a revolutionary period that to plan one 's life , nowadays , is to revert to a Victorian middle-class mentality . Q : Would you go back to teaching at Harvard ? A : I might . But it 's very , very unlikely . There are more interesting things . And if , after all the experience I 've acquired , I 'm unable to keep on leading an interesting life , it will be my own ? fault entirely . Besides , I 've by no means decided to give up this job yet . You know , I enjoy it very much . Q : Naturally . Power is always seductive . Dr. Kissinger , to what extent does power fascinate you ? Try to be sincere . A : I will be . You see , when one wields power , and when one has it for a long time , one ends up thinking one has a right to it . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of power . However , power as an instrument in its own right has no fascination for me . I do n't wake up every morning exclaiming by God , is n't it extraordinary that I am able to dispose of a plane , that a car with a driver waits at my door ? Who would have thought it possible ? No , I 'm not interested in such reflections . And if I do happen to entertain them , they certainly never become a determinating factor . What interests me is what one can achieve with THE NEW REPUBLIC power . Splendid things , believe me . . . However , it is not the craving for power that has spurred me on to take this job . If you examine my political past , you will discover that President Nixon could n't have been in ? cluded in my plans . I 've been against him in three elections . Q : I know . You even once declared that Nixon " was n't suited to be President . " Does this fact ever make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I do n't remember the exact words I may have used against Nixon . I presume that is more or less what I must have said , since the phrase is constantly quoted between inverted commas . However , if I did say it , it 's a proof that Nixon was not included . in my plans for a rise to power . As for feeling . embarrassment in his presence . . . No , I did n't know him , that 's all . My atti ? tude towards him was the conventional highbrow one , that 's all . I was wrong . President Nixon has shown great strength , great skill . In summoning me to his side , too . I had never met him when he offered me this job . I was astonished . After all , he was acquainted with the unfriendly and unsympathetic attitude I had al ? ways assumed towards him . Yes indeed , he showed great courage in turning to me . Q : He made a good deal , Dr. Kissinger . Except for the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mental nurse . A : It is an utterly senseless charge . We must n't forget that , before he ever met me , President Nixon had been very active in matters of foreign policy . It had always been his consuming interest . Even before he was elected it was obvious that foreign policy mattered greatly to him . He has very clear ideas on the subject . He is a strong character . Besides , a weakling would never have been twice nominated presidential candi ? date , would never have survived in politics for so long . You can think what you like of President Nixon , but one thing is certain : you do n't become President of the United States twice running because you 're another man 's tool . Such interpretations are romantic and unjust . Q : You 're very fond of him , Dr. Kissinger , are n't you ? A : I have great respect for him . Q : Dr. Kissinger , people say you do n't care about Nixon . They say all you care about is the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it under any president . A : I on the other hand , am not at all so sure I could have done what I 've done with him with another pres ? ident . Such a special relationship , I mean the relation ? ship between the President and me , always depends on the style of both men . In other words , I do n't know many leaders , and I 've met several , who would have DECEMBER 16 , 1972 the courage to send their aide to Peking without tell ? ing anyone . I do n't know many leaders who would entrust to their aide the task of negotiating with the North Vietnamese , informing only a tiny group of people of the initiative . Really , some things depend on the type of president . What I 've done was acheived because he made it possible for me to do it . Q : And yet , you have been an adviser to other presidents too , presidents who were Nixon 's opponents , in fact . I mean Kennedy , Johnson . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same : I let them decide whether they wanted my opinion or not . When they asked for it , I gave it to them , telling them all , indiscriminately , what I thought . I was never concerned with what party they belonged to . I answered Kennedy 's , Johnson 's and Nixon 's questions with the same independence . I gave them the same advice . There was some difficulty in Kennedy 's case , true . In fact , people usually state that I disagreed with him . Well , yes , it was my fault , in substance . I was much too immature at the time . More ? over , I was only a part-time adviser ; one ca n't hope to influence a president 's day-to-day politics if one only meets him twice a week while there are others who see him every day . I mean that in Kennedy 's and John ? son 's time I was never in a comparable position to the one I now enjoy with Nixon . Q : Not Machiavellian by any chance , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Q : Oh , only that , listening to you , one sometimes won ? ders not how much you have influenced the President of the United States , but to what extent you have been in ? fluenced by Machiavelli . A : To none whatever . There , is really very little of Machiavelli 's one can accept or use in the contempo ? rary world . The one thing I find interesting in Machia ? velli is his estimate of the Prince 's will . Interesting , but not such as to influence me . If you want to know who has influenced me most , I 'll answer with two philosophers ' names : Spinoza and Kant . Which makes it all the more peculiar that you choose to associate me with Machiavelli . Most people associate me with Met ? ternich . And that is childish . My only connection with Metternich is a book I wrote : it was to be the ' first volume in a lengthy study of the construction and dis ? integration of international order in the nineteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the first world war , that 's all . There can be nothing in common between me and Metternich . He was chan ? cellor and foreign minister at a time when it took three weeks to travel from Central Europe to the ends of the continent . He was chancellor and foreign minister at a time when wars were conducted by professional sol ? diers and diplomacy was in the hands of the aristoc 21 racy . How can one compare such conditions with the ones prevailing in today 's world , a world where there is no homogeneous group of leaders , no homo ? geneous internal , situation and no homogeneous cul ? tural background ? Q : But , Dr. Kissinger , how do you explain your incredible superstar status , how do you explain the fact that you have become almost more famous and popular than a pres ? ident ? Have you any theories ? A : Yes , but I wo n't tell you what they are . Because they do n't coincide with the common theory . Intelligence , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , and is often , in point of fact , useless . Just as a leader does n't need intelligence , a man in my job does n't need too much of it either . My theory is quite different , but , I repeat , I wo n't tell you what it is . Why should I , while I 'm still in the middle of my job ? Instead , you tell me yours . I 'm sure you too have some theory on the reasons for my popularity . Q : I 'm not sure , Dr. Kissinger . I 'm looking for a theory in this interview . But I have n't found one yet . I expect the root of all lies in success . What I mean is , like a chess player you 've made two or three clever moves . China , first of all . People admire a chess player who makes away with his opponent 's king . A : Yes , China was an important element in the me ? chanics of my success . And yet , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Well , why not ? I 'll tell you . What do I care after all ? The main point stems from the fact that I 've always acted alone . Americans admire that enormously . Americans admire the cowboy lead ? ing the caravan alone astride his horse , the cowboy entering a village or city alone on his horse . Without even a pistol , maybe , because he does n't go in for shooting . He acts , that 's all : aiming at the right spot at the right time . A Wild West tale , if you like . Q : I see . You see yourself as a kind of Henry Fonda , un ? armed and ready to fight with his bare fists for honest ideals . Solitary , brave . A : Not necessarily brave . This cowboy does n't need courage . It 's enough that he be alone , that he show others how he enters the village alone and does every ? thing on his own . This romantic , surprising character suits me , because being alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my technique if you prefer . Independ ? ence too . Yes , that 's very important to me and in me . And , finally , conviction . I am always convinced of the necessity of whatever I 'm doing . And people feel that , believe in it . And I attach great importance to being believed : when one persuades or conquers someone , one must n't deceive them . Nor can one do everything by calculation alone . Some believe I carefully plan whatever consequences on the public one of my initia tives or efforieMittplEGIE **27;2331;TOOLONG stant preoccupation of mine . On the contrary , the consequences of my actions , I mean public opinion 's verdict , have never worried me . I 'm not asking for popularity , I 'm not seeking it . In fact , if you really want to know , I care nothing for popularity . I 'm not at all afraid of losing my public support , I can afford to say what I think . I am referring to what is genuine in me . If I let myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of a calculated technique , I should achieve nothing . Take actors , for instance , the really good ones do n't rely on mere technique . They also follow their feelings when they play a part . Like me , they are genuine . I do n't mean to say that all this will last forever . In fact , it may evaporate as quickly as it came . But for the time being it 's there . Q : Are you trying to tell me , Dr. Kissinger , that you 're a spontaneous person ? Heavens : if I 'm not to think of Ma ? chiavelli , the first type my mind associates you with is a mathematician , someone who is almost spasmodically cold and controlled . I may be mistaken , but I believe you 're a very cold man , Dr. Kissinger . A : In tactics , not in strategy . In fact , I believe in human relations more than in ideas . I make use of ideas , but I need , human relations , as I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has happened to me happen by chance ? For God 's sake , I was a totally unknown pro ? fessor , was n't I ? How could I possibly tell myself : " Now I 'm going to fix things so as to become an in ? ternational celebrity " ? It would have been pure folly . I wanted to be where the action is , true , but I never paid a price to get there . I never made any concessions . I have always been guided by spontaneous decisions . One might retort : then it happened because it had to happen . That 's what people always say when things have happened . One never hears it said of things that have n't happened ; nobody has ever written the his ? tory of things that have n't happened . In a sense , how ? ever , I am a fatalist . I believe in fate . True , I believe one must fight to attain a goal . But I also believe there are limits to the fight a man may engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Dr. Kissinger : how do you reconcile the tremendous responsibilities you have shouldered with the frivolous reputation you enjoy ? How can you succeed in being taken seriously by Mao Tse-tung , Chou En-lai and Le Duc Tho on one hand and be judged a carefree Don Juan or even playboy on the other ? Does n't it embarrass you ? A : Not at all . Why should it embarrass me when I go off to negotiate with Le Duc Tho ? When I 'm talking to Le Duc Tho , I know how to behave with Le Duc Tho , and when I 'm with a girl , I know how to behave with a girl . Besides , Le Duc Tho is n't agreeing to negotiate with me because I 'm an example of all the moral vir ? tues . He agrees to negotiate with me because he wants certain things from me as I do from him . As a matter of fact , in case of Le Duc Tho , as with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai , I believe my playboy reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped and helps to reassure people , to show them I 'm not a museum piece . In any case , my frivolous reputation amuses me . Q : And to think I believed it undeserved , a put-on act rather than the truth . A : Well , it 's partly overdone , of course . But it 's partly , let 's admit it , true . What counts is not how true it is or how much time I devote to women . What counts is to what extent women are part of my life , a central pre ? occupation . Well , they are n't that at all . To me women are no more than a pastime , a hobby . Nobody devotes too much time to a hobby . Moreover , my engagement book is there to show I only devote a limited portion of my time to them . What 's more , I often prefer to visit my two children . I still see them often , although less frequently than before . As a rule I spend Christmas , other holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Boston once a month to see them . You probably know I 've been divorced for several years . No , being divorced does n't bother me . The fact that I do n't live with my children does n't give me any guilt complexes . Since my marriage was through , and not owing to any fault on either side , there was no reason not to divorce . Besides , -I 'm much closer to my children now than when I was their mother 's husband . I 'm also much happier in their company now . Q : Are you against marriage , Dr. Kissinger ? A : No . The problem of marriage for or against is a dilemma that can be solved as a question of principle . I might marry again ... oh , yes , I might . However , you know , for a serious person like me , after all , it is very difficult to co-exist with someone else and to survive such co-existence . The relationship between a woman and a man of my type is unavoidably very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard it is for me to explain these things . I 'm not a person that usually confides in journalists . Q : So 1 gather , Dr. Kissinger . I 've never interviewed any ? one that evaded close questions and definitions like you , anyone that defended themselves as strenuously as you from attempts to penetrate their personality . Are you shy , by any chance , Dr. Kissinger ? A : Yes , I am rather . On the other hand , however , I believe I 'm fairly well balanced . You see , there are those that describe me as a mysterious , tormented char ? acter , and others who see me as a merry guy always smiling , always laughing . Both these images are un ? true . I 'm neither the one nor the other . I 'm . . . No , I wo n't tell you what I am . I 'll never tell anyone .
