The case of William Lemmer , a tormented young Vietnam veteran who tried to oppose the war but instead betrayed everyone ? his fellow dissenters , his FBI manipulators , his wife , and , most of IAN THE LAST WEEKEND OF MAY this year , a long-de- ferred meeting of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War was held at the home of Scott Camil in Gainesville , Florida . Confined for the most part to veterans from the Southern sector of the antiwar group , the gathering was very informal : the twenty-odd people present included not only the group 's Southern leaders but many local members and even a few nonmembers . The discussion , in part , focused on how the group was to organize protest activities at the upcoming political conventions in Miami Beach . As talk swirled and eddied among the small , fragmented cliques clustered here and there about the house . one of the more prominent participants was repeatedly heard talking about shooting and bombing . According to many who were present , violent proposals gushed from him almost uncontrollably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard was people telling him that shooting and bombing were not good things to do . I also remember someone saying . ' 1 do n't think I could kill someone , ' and similar statements . ' The young veteran with the explosive rhetoric and yin . lent schemes was William W. Lemmer , a twenty-two-year. old from Texarkana , Arkansas , who was then attending the state university at Fayetteville , Arkansas , on the GI Bill . His speech was matched by his appearance : flamboyant ; deliberately , even excessively , unconventional , he seemed the very model of the gung-ho activist . On May 29 when the last session was over , Bill Lemmer took aside the two VVAW leaders , and confessed to their that for the past nine months he had been an informer for the FBI . A week later , in Fayetteville , he expanded this confession in an eight-hour tape-recorded interview be gave to two other VVAW associates . On June 30 , the tape turned up in the mail of the American Civil Liberties Union Project on Political Surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shortly after I had the tape transcribed , a Florida fed eral grand jury began hearing testimony about a con spiracy allegedly conceived by the VVAW in April ant developed at the Gainesville meeting in May .

The grand jury charged the young vet erans with plotting to disrupt the Republican iNationa Convention . It said that they had conspired " to organize numerous ' fire teams ' to attack with automatic weapons fire and incendiary devices police stations , police cars am stores in Miami Beach " ; that they intended to " fire lea ( weights , ' fried ' marbles , ball bearings , ' cherry ' hombs smoke bombs by means of wrist rockets , sling shots am cross bows , " and that they planned to " disrupt communi cations systems in Miami Beach .

The tap , thus illuminated the complex and fascinating circum stances of Lemmer 's life as an intelligence agent , his rol , as a provocateur , and his reliability as a witness on whos , word the fate of the defendants in an important crimina case might well depend .

Rinehart and Winston . Army associates . This , then , is the story of Lemmer 's career as a spy . Under the gun N -O ONE KNOWS FOR SURE when William Lemmer first began to suspect that he was under surveillance by an Army intelligence unit . Possibly it was in the early fall of 1970 when he was initially caught up in the antiwar movement . lie was in Japan at the time recuperating from an attack of acute bronchial asthma that put an early end to his second ( and voluntary ) combat tour in Vietnam . By the end of 1971 , however , his suspicions had congealed into a fearful certainty . He was at Fort Retning , Georgia , an out-front activist now , cartooning for the underground paper on the base , signing peace petitions , testifying in Congress against the war , and " fall of talk about destroying the Army and the Government . " This is the recollection of Regie Mullen , a slight young woman with red-gold hair and granny glasses who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew Lemmer fairly well in those days . " Everything that happened to him , " Mrs. Mullen went on to say , " was in his eyes part of a pattern of persecution , especially by Military Intelligence . Like that hole in his trailer . There was a hole in his trailer which he insisted was made by a bullet shot by M I. " Lemmer 's wife also recalls that MI seemed to obsess him . A short , chubby young woman who would look like a little girl if it were n't for her quietly intense expression , Mary had been married to Lemmer for only a short time . She remembers that for long periods he would leave her alone in their trailer , and when she complained he would say he had to do it , that someone had to check on the spies . Then one day ? no one knows when exactly , because , of course , he told no one ? William Lerhmer went to the FBI , and took the first step of what was to be a nine-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , " a self-security type thing . I had security problems that I was worried about and for self-protection I used my position as an informer to cover a lot of people , myself included . " To see generosity in an act of betrayal requires unusual powers of rationalization , or an unusual susceptibility to delusion . William Lemmer was well endowed with both . but then he was an unusual sort of informer . Most undercover agents are motivated by the prospect of reward ( as was the case of the Berrigan/McAlister spy , Boyd Douglas ) or by political hostility ( Tommy the Traveler ) ? or by some combination of the two . But Lemmer was drawn to the FBI by fear . He became and remained an informer not for money ( though he was soon to find himself dependent on the Bureau 's financial support ) or defense of his political values ( he seems genuinely to have shared the views of his victims 1 but rather in a terrified quest for a haven from his pursuing demons , a quest that the Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemmer 's story should not obscure its institutional and historical continuities . People who are recruited by intelligence agencies as plants are typically made of unpromising human materials ; one has only to think of Judas , Titus Oates , Azeff , Mathew Cvetic , Paul Crouch ? to cite five quite different examples . Spiesare very hard to come by ? " A right-thinking man refuses such a job , " as Judge George W. Anderson once put it ? and the spy-master must make do . For almost a quarter of a century , the FBI has " run " many thousands of political spies not as a casual or optional matter but as chosen instruments for the collection of political intelligence , unrelated to law enforcement . The systematic subornation of betrayal is part of the Bureau 's " mission. - as the intelligence people call it . And the army of recruits for this mission is made up largely of damaged souls . Lemmer 's induction as a spy did n't happen right away , of course , not at that first meeting with the agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art , in September 1971 . He was out of the Army by then , and he and Mary had returned to Fayetteville , where Lemmer was attending the state university . Then , late in September , ' , crawler and some friends were arrested on a marijuana charge in Leavenworth County , Kansas , where they 'd gone in Lemmer 's car . Lemmer does n't tell us his feelings as he sat in jail awaiting trial . After six days , however , he alone was released , and he was left in no ' doubt about who had intervened . " They brought me out , " Lemmer recalled , " and said , ' Well , your bond has been posted ... you know by whom . ' And I was given instructions to contact the Bureau when I got back to Fayetteville . And everybody was really apologetic . " This is a common way of snaring an informer . He is rescued by the Bureau from a pending criminal charge , and for this he is presumably grateful . In Lemmer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bust were sentenred to prison . If the recruit proves ungrateful and fails to " cooperate , " by turning informer , the Bureau always has the option of reactivating the case . Lemmer 's subsequent account of the interview that formally established his relationship with the Bureau is most revealing of FRI procedure in securing what it calls " informants . " It also suggests the casually exploitive way in which it enlisted Lemmer 's services : They made contact with me and we sat down and ran through this shit . If I did work fur them . what were my motives ? This , that , and the other . By this time I had a pretty good picture of what they were up to . . . I did n't feel uneasy talking to them because of prior contact . Other people did . I told them payment on this thing is ridiculous because at that time I did n't see myself as being a representative of them but rather the representative , sort of the liaison , between ourselves and them ? nothing sensitive would pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as part of that check there came out an MI dossier regarding an alleged conspiracy to steal weapons from the Central Arms Room in Fort Benning , Georgia . . . . They confronted me with this and said , " What 's the meaning of this ? " I put it down to an amateurish stunt by MI to get at me . . . I wrote that all off as being the work of amateurs . They seemed to like that word , amateurs , because they see themselves as being professionals ... From there I cleared myself with MI and , using the Bureau again , I had something to fight back with . After this , Lemmer became more deeply involved in the activities of the small Fayetteville chapter of Vietnam Veterans Against the War . He participated in meetings arid demonstrations , first as rank and lile , then as a leader . We have two descriptions of him at this stage in his career . The first is from Martin Jordan , a student and former VVAW state coordinator , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession . Jordan is a striking-looking young man in his early twenties . Half Choctaw. he has deep-set eyes . a full beard , and long hair bound in a headband that also serves to disguise a receding hairline . An Oklahoman , he speaks softly in the accents of that part of the country . Bill is about 5 ' 9 " -5 ' 10 " , dark hair , weight about 175.180 . No distinguishing marks on him , but when he gets in a bind or uptight he tenses up , and when he tenses up he turns almost white , his eyes get glazed . . . He 's on some kind of downers for his asthma and as a counter-reaction of the downers , he takes speed . He 's a very nervous person . He considers himself to be an intellectual on any subject you bring up , and his ego is twofold to anyone I ever met ... Other than that , he was more radical sometimes than most people I 've met who have come out of combat and aim were ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was if they did n't go along with it , fuck it , we can kill them . Lemincr 's energy , compulsive grandstanding , and boastful buccaneering style startled or repelled most of the local vets ; but he soon earned a following among a few radicals , nonstudent hippies , and street people . One of the latter is Mike Damron , who had been in and out of Vietnam for five years when he first met Lemmer . Damron is something of a character in Fayetteville . A Thoreauvian village anarchist , he is respected for the purity of his commitment , even though his different drummer sometimes marches him to disorderly-conduct arrests . Damron paints a more sympathetic picture of Lemmer than Jordan does , but it is in no way inconsistent . One thing that impressed me about Bill was his enthusiasm , his willingness to do something , to be into where things were going on . Like it was Bill 's idea to organize outside of Fayetteville , and it was the first time that this had been attempted in Arkansas . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of it oil to the fact that he had n't been back from . Vietnam too long , and a lot of people tend to be that way ... Bill was willing to get in there and do things ; that 's why I liked him . The ties that bind -1 TITIIIN A SHORT TIME after his induction interview / v at the local FBI office , Lemmer developed a close relationship with his controller , Dick O'Connell . Lemmer was flattered by the way Agent O'Connell seemed to take him into his confidence , talking candidly about people whom the Bureau suspected of organizing local disturbances , asking Femmer 's help in locating radicals , commenting paternally , tolerantly , on the failings of some of the younger man 's associates . Such treatment did more than lubricate Lemmer 's cooperativeness with the Bureau ; it enabled him to reshape reality to conform to his inner needs . His former persecutors , Military Intelligence , seemed for the moment at least to have been neutralized , but the role they had played in his psychic drama was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs , " as Lemmer called them , who seemed always to be there at the demonstrations and marches organized by the VVAW . And the logic that had led him , back in Georgia , to seek protection from MI in the more " professional " FBI worked equally well when the enemy became the police . As mentor and protector , Dick O'Connell was indispensable . He also became financially useful . Both in his taped confession and by outside report , Lemmer was extremely sensitive about the matter of compensation ; accepting money from the FBI violated his benign conception of his role as guarantor of VVAW safety I and his own ) . In his confession he makes a point of the fact that he attended a VVAW National Steering Committee meeting in Kansas City " out of my own money . " But after that , he recalls : First of all I tried refusing money , bull you ca n't do it . . . I told them , " No . First of all I 'm not working for the Bureau . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I did n't give the FBI anything there that I thought would be a compromise . And that 's when they said , " It would n't hurt for Lis to reimburse you for the expenses . " And I got so tired of going back and forth and hack and forth . I needed the money too . And so I finally just said , " Fine . Reimburse me . " From then on , the Bureau would pay his expenses on out-of-town jaunts , the enormous phone bills on his credit card i the number of which he freely gave to other VVAW people 1 , and the installment payments on his car . O'Connell also took care of Mary 's emergency household hills . In return , during his frequent sessions with O'Connell in Fayetteville , Lemmer would identify people in photographs , describe the roles and behavior of VVAW activists , and hash over the group 's internal politics . On the many occasions when he left town to attend VVAW meetings and rallies in other areas , he would eventually be debriefed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these trips the name and phone number of a local Bureau agent . For him , this information represented security from the local police . For the Bureau , of course , it meant detailed intelligence on their surveil ? lance targets . Throughout the winter of 1971-2 . Lemmer found him . self more and more caught up in antiwar activities . And as his participation escalated , inevitably and unconsciously he crossed the almost invisible line that separates the informer from the agent provocateur . Lemmer had been trained in Special Forces , and the experience left him with a taste for dramatic tactics , guerrilla warfare , exotic weaponry ; and violence . He knew , of course , that instigating violent acts was against the FBI 's rules , as well as against the law . Nevertheless , he was always looking foi ways to indulge his proclivities without the Bureau 's knowing about it . The VVAW interviewers who listened to his confession specifically asked him how be justified some of the wild exhortations to violence that burst out of hits at planning sessions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooling in weapons . IFI1 God , / know weapons . I had three years and four month ! of weapons , and this is what ! know . Of course , if there 's a discussion , I 'm going to enter into it I was talking about weapons . I was talking about frags . There were at least two occasions , even in Fayetteville , when Lemmer went beyond merely discussing these matters . One of these was a threat to bomb a building if Dean Rusk were permitted to speak on the University of Arkansas campus . The local newspaper received a letter , composed in good kidnap fashion with words snipped from printed publications , to the effect that a left-wing group on campus ( not the VVAW l would carry out the bombing . According to Mike Damron , however , it was Lemmer who conceived the whole scheme in order to discredit the rival group . Mike Damron was later arrested and indicted for his part in the bomb threat . William Lemmer has admitted to having tipped off the FBI . Another incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Arkansas campus . Lemmer , in his confession , admits to having told a seventeen-year-old student , Mark C. Vanceil , how to make the bomb ( " ether would be better than gasoline " ) . He also admits that the next day he picked up the materials and helped place the bomb in the building . The student was caught by waiting FBI agents , arrested , and convicted . Apart from Lemmer 's unsuexssful struggles with his provocative inclinations there was a certain flair or brio about his spying . He was fertile with suggestions for the Bureau in its efforts to influence VVAW policy for its own purposes . At one point it sent Lemmer to New York to revive a rejected plan for a visit , o Hanoi by a VVAW delegation . The Bureau was eager a ) contribute financially , if money was the problem , and . o insure Lemmer 's selection as a delegate . When that seemed unlikely , Lemmer proposed to the FBI that only hose who were " airborne qualified " ( as he was ) be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the plan ultimately onoilered . Fear and dependence FN A. MIND LIKE LEMMER 'S , every form of engagement with the world ultimately becomes a cage of fears . In weird kaleidoscopic sequence , commitment becomes iate , and hate dissolves into fear . This process explains a , ehavior pattern of acting out fantasies of violence ( strikrig at " them " before " they " could get at him ) , followed ? y a swift retreat to a protective haven that in turn becomes new source of anxiety . And so , as Lemmer intensified his ntiwar commitment , he began to pay a terrible price in ear of retaliation . His confession is filled with allusions ) his growing dependence on the Bureau for protection . At Fort Hood , Texas , for example , he was planning a eaceful demonstration when he spotted two of his aparently indefatigable pursuers , MI agents who were stening to what was going on . " That night , " he recalls , I broke away and made a phone call and I told them the Bureau specifically there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were corning in with leaflets . " The FBI , evidently , was to call off the military agents on the ground that Lcmmer 's intentions ( this time ) were entirely nonviolent . Later , he was in New Orleans for another " action , " and he heard that bombs had been placed ( possibly by the Minutemen ) in the VVAW cars . And so I got on the phone then and told Dick , " Hey man , they 're bombing the coordinators ' cars . " And he got really bent out of shape . his reaction was , " Oh fuck . ' ' He ) wanted to know immediately if I had an alternate place to park mine . And I told him no . So he got on the phone and called New Orleans and found out that they were n't bombed . They were trashed , that 's all . He put me at ease about the possibilities of further bombing and said no bombs were involved . So they had knowledge of the fact that the cars were trashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informer 's fears . According to Lemmer , the agent would call his home several times a week to inquire about his safety . At the same time , O'Connell carefully nurtured the young veteran 's reliance on the Bureau , reassuring him that so lung as he continued to cooperate nothing would happen to him . For several months these talks with his controller gibed nicely with Lemmer 's own grandiose sense of himself to produce feelings of invulnerability , an invulnerability that , moreover , he could bestow on his associates like a blessing . Lemmer had it all worked out in his mind : as a Bureau spy he was immune to arrest . But if , in a group of demonstrators , he alone was spared , his cover would be blown . Thus , no arrests for anyone . Even after he surfaced to tell his victims that he had betrayed them we find him clinging to this curious view of himself as a protector : As a result of my presence the police more or less gritted their teeth and walked on by and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , whenever I 'd go into some place , the police there were made aware of the fact that someone in that group of people was working with them the Bureau . and they really do n't gel into the idea of plucking one of those people out on some loitering charge or jaywalking charge and putting them in jail . If there were no arrests , Lemmer took it as proof of the protective power of his role . If there were arrests or something went . wrong , he blamed it on the fact that the Bureau was not aware of his presence or had failed to rommunicate with local authorities . The spy spied upon S OMETHING SOON PLACED a formidable strain on this soothing dialectic that converted betrayal into protection , and ultimately it transformed his security into a nightmare . This was Lemmer 's deepening commitment to the goals and style of the group he was betraying and his growing identification with fellow members . Simultaneously , he felt the full impact of a fact he had surely known ali along but had somehow been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only informer in the VVAW . According to his confession , his own balance of terror began to tip against the FBI and in favor of the VVAW at a meeting in Denver in early 1972 when he became an Acting Regional Coordinator : By the time of Denver ... I had to provide something for the FBI as far as the VVAW scenario was concerned and at the same time to provide some amount of security fur the people there . I started running into conflicts when I would leave out a point in the scenario , or switch it around , and they 'd turn it right back to me . And Denver got me thinking in terms of other people informers that were there . It began to make my head pound ... And I wondered exactly who the other people were , and I was becoming more and more security conscious at Denver . At his debriefing after the Denver meeting , he told O'Connell that he suspected another VVAW member of being an informer : I was more convinced that he was working for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was working for an accredited national agency , then who the hell was he working for ? ... I wanted to know who he was and the Bureau would n't give an answer . As Lemmer lurched hack and forth between the Bureau and the VVAW in alternate spasms of fear and guilt , he began to look for a way out . Gradually , as he traveled around to VVAW meetings and " actions , " he formed a number of apparently platonic relationships with women in which he would confess to being an informer and then usually seek assurance of their protection if trouble came . These women became a healing refuge , a compromise between an unendurable deception and a full confession to the targets themselves . As he explained on the tapes : I wanted someone to tell . All I could do was , from time to time , let someone completely neutral know , to take the pressure off my head . Like living a deceit is a hell of a thing . particularly when your head is into trying to organize and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are people like yourself around you . If it were n't for these women that I choose one at a time , then the pressure of what I was trying to do . it would become unbearable . He had to make sure , however , that his confidantes were truly neutral and would not denounce him either to the Bureau or to the VVAW . And what better way to establish their qualifications than by asking the Bureau ? Early in his relationship with O'Connell he had worked out an arrangement that ostensibly permitted him to " check out " the Bureau 's files on particular individuals . It is unlikely that he was really accorded this extraordinary privilege , but his illusion was part of the Bureau 's " protective " strategy in dealing with Lemmer ? to encourage him to feel that the full resources of the Bureau were at his disposal to insure his safety . But if it was easy to get information on his female friends , quite the opposite was true when he tried to find out what other infiltrators were reporting on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the hell R was , and they did n't come back with anything . . . And I kept pressing fur something on II and I pressed and pressed and pressed and finally dropped it because they would n't come back with anything . They could n't even get a service record back on him . After a while Lemmer concluded that whenever his agent reported to him that the Bureau had no record on a man , he was almost certainly another FBI informer . he was probably right in this , but the knowledge gave him little peace of mind and made the Bureau seem even less reliable as a source of protection . It also quickened an emerging resolve to confess all to his colleagues in the VVAW . No place to hide 4EMMER 'S FEELING OF SAFETY from arrest or harass ment may or may not have been well-founded when he was operating in Arkansas . Elsewhere , he recalls : I had to deal with local and state police on my own , and if I got busted , then the only thing that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the agents . That 's if I had a number for one and , if not , I 'd just tell them , " Why do n't you locate the FBI for me . I 'll talk to them but not to you . " Things could easily go wrong in this game , however , and they did in April 1972 . Lemmer was arrested in a demonstration at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma City and , together with others , jailed . He told the local authorities to call Fayetteville and tell them he was in custody . After spending the next five days in jail , he alone was offered release on his own recognizance by a United States marshall . Despite the risk of exposure , Lemmer accepted . " I do n't see that much advantage to staying in jail , " he said later . He was wrong . The suspicions stirred up by his release were soon verified by more substantial evidence . One of the officials who had seen to Lemmer 's release described the veteran to his son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercover FBI . " Local VVAW members , and through them an ACLU lawyer , learned of it when the son , who apparently did n't share his father 's admiration for the Bureau , promptly contacted some VVAW people . The Tinker demonstrators , who were tried and eon ? victcd last August ( eight men received jail sentences : four women were placed on probation ) , insist that it was Lemmer who originally proposed that they penetrate the base ? the heart of the criminal charges against them . This claim is sup ? ported by the testimony of a Gov. ernment witness , the arresting officer , that Lemmer was " a potential troublemaker . " Ile was apparently unaware that Lemmer was a spy ; indeed , the Govern ment itself claimed at the hid that Lemmer was not acting an informer " in the instant case , " an implausible conten tion in view of the fact that , although charged with tIn same offense as the others , he was never brought to tria and was quickly whisked off by the Bureau on informe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exposure was pereolatirq down from Oklahoma City to Fayetteville , Lemmer , after briefly touching home base , whirled off on a VVAW circui that took him to Washington , D.C. , New York City , back tf Washington , and then , finally , to the rendezvous in Gainesville . Lemmer 's Washington experiences again illustrate the way he was squeezed between the Bureau and the VVAW . On his first visit he was rounded up in a mass arrest . On his second he was " trashed " in a Pentagon demonstration . " I was one of the people that they knocked down the stairs . I was one of the people that they threw tear gas on , and it exploded on . " How could they do this to him ? After all , he was the one who was out there to tell them " which way the wind was blowing . " And it was , as he later put it , " my presence at demonstrations like this that offered protection and tolerance as far as the police go . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people in which there might he someone that was working for the federal government . " Naturally , after this he checked back with his local agent to find out what had gone wrong . Everybody in the Bureau was sorry and unhappy , he recalled ; it was simply that they had n't been notified of his presence . The same foul-up had been responsible for the Tinker Air Force Base fiasco . Nevertheless , the Washington trashing disturbed Lemmer deeply . It further convinced him that he had more to fear from the FBI than from the VVAW . But more than that , it furthered his resolve to surface and tell all to his brothers . The Gainesville trip was the first Lemmer undertook not as a matter of choice but as an order . On his way he picked up Barbara Stocking , a Quaker and a graduate assistant in philosophy at Boston University , whom he had met on one of his visits to Washington : she had tended his dog ? a large Dalmatian named Pasha ? while he bad marched . Miss Stocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit relatives in Orlando . On the road , Lemmer once again felt an overpowering need to unburden himself . The fragile universe of dominions and powers that had precariously sustained him for the past few months was beginning to come apart . Everywhere he looked enemies were converging on him , dark emissaries from an all-embracing reign of terror , and his mind was working frantically to comprehend its name . According to Miss Stocking , he talked almost incessantly for the better part of the two days they spent together driving to Gainesville . He spoke of the trouble he had had in the Army , and of the " hassling " he was now getting from not only the F131 but the CIA and the ACLU as well . Lemmer told her not to go to the Miami conventions because there was going to he fighting , shooting , and rioting , and the whole VVAW leadership would be picked up arid taken out of circulation . This last prediction was a variation of a theme much discussed in ' 4 VAW and other activist circles earlier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed that Nixon 's escalation of the bombing in North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong harbor would be the prelude to a nationwide mass crackdown on antiwar groups . In Lemmer 's imagination this sinister prospect had become a certainty , and for a while prior to the Gainesville trip it seemed to him that the enemy 's visor had lifted at last . It was not the FBI or the VVAW who was seeking his destruction , but a shadowy all-powerful megastructure , a " phantom government . " as he put it . The accelerated vio lence in Vietnam would trigger a crackdown by the " invisible power " in Washington , and this would be followed by a revolutionary confrontation . He alerted his friends to pack their bags and be ready to move . He told his wife Mary that the revolution that was supposed to occur in ' 76 was going to break out now , any day . This scenario was not entirely displeasing to Lemmer . He came to believe that he and his friends would be driven underground where they would break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the one hand , being constantly observed by his cellmates , he would have a perfect excuse for not calling the Bureau , while on the other hand , VVAW members in other cells would be protected from informers because the informers ' movements also would be easy to monitor . He may have thought too that communications among the cells would be so difficult that rumors of his being an informer would die down . The fact that no domestic upheaval followed the escalation of the war did nothing to reduce Lemmer 's fears . The date of the roundup simply shifted to some time after the Miami conventions . Then too , of course , he was still hooked by O'Connell , and the agent milked the young veteran 's nightmarish fantasies : I was told by O'Connell to prepare a list of movement people around Fayetteville who I could count on should I have to go underground . He confirmed that possibility . Openly at one of our meetings , in fact . the last of our meetings . To the point that we discussed alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move around the country . Lemmer named everyone , not only VVAW activists but other movement people as well But , as he would later be at pains to tell his confessors , he put his own name at the head of the list . All this was unbearably weighing on his mind as he drove down toward Gainesville . The first confession T HAT A SPY IS SUSPECTED by his targets rarely makes hum confess . Lemmer was aware that he had blown his cover in Oklahoma , and he had waited . terrified but nonetheless expectant , for his fellows to denounce him . They never did . But the strain forced him at last , after so many rehearsals with well-disposed neutral confidantes , to denounce himself . The list of activists that O'Connell had told him to draw up undoubtedly helped drive him to confession . Thinking of himself as a soldier , he could n't help thinking of his comrades as buddies . They were all in combat now , and in combat it is simply unthinkable to betray one 's buddies . To Lernmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seemed that he had time to retrieve the situation and redeem himself in the eyes of the VVAW leaders he expected to meet there . There was one problem , and it tormented him . This was the prospect of FBI reprisal , the crushing fear that another Bureau informer would report his confession . The tapes record his memory of the agony : I did n't know who the hell I could trust . Things I would say as passing comment would shoot back to the Bureaul quick as shit , so T really did n't know who was safe . But I knew who the Government was worried ai t , and this is what I had to count on . These were the people 1 had to talk to . Miss Stocking is among those who remember that when they arrived at the house of VVAW leader Scott Camil in Gainesville . Lemmer continued to talk wildly of shooting and bombing . To her mind , he seemed to be acting as an agent provocateur . But the weird and reckless nature of Lemmer 's proposals at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully explained by his bitter rage at the Bureau for its failure to protect him from being " trashed " at the Pentagon , and by his eagerness to demonstrate a kind of exemplary rnilitance for the benefit of the leaders to whom he was planning to confess in private at the end of the session . Ile told them everything , beginning with Fort Benning when he had enlisted the FBI , as he saw it , as a shield against the sinister surveillance of Military Intelligence . He told them how terribly hard it had been for him to serve both the FBI and the VVAW , but how necessary as well . And finally he told them about the list of people he had given O'Connell . He ended by proposing that he become a double agent , using his FBI connections to finance VVAW activities . This was Lemmer 's first confession , and all we know of it is contained in the tape-recorded account he gave later in Fayetteville . Thus we do n't know how Camil and the others reacted . We do know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a fresh charge of fear at the possibility of FBI retaliation . The crack-tip 4EMN1ER DM NOT RETURN directly to Fayetteville . Instead he slowly made his way to Texarkana , his home-town . He made the trip in near constant terror , perceiving swarms of FBI agents on the road : There were brand-new Fords all over the road , sitting in exits , driving past me , all the same people . I say all the same people , the same looking people , all with the uniform sunglasses , all with uniform haircuts . . . I was observed all the way . Reaching Texarkana at last , he immediately had his beard shaved off and his hair cut . This , of course , was to throw the FBI off his trail . But he may also have thought that the mass crackdown was beginning . He then called his wife in Fayetteville to arrange for her to drive down to Texarkana . Ile happened to reach her while Donald Donner was at their apartment telling her about Lemmer 's being an informer . Mary confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her later account , he fell to pieces . He recovered sufficiently , however , to speak to Donner and ask him to meet him in Texarkana . Reluctant to sec Lemmer alone , Donner recruited Martin Jordan to join him , and they arranged to go down with Mary the following day . But Lemmer 's mind was now shot through with fear . When he learned that Donner was bringing Jordan , he became convinced that they were coming to kill him and that Mary was also in danger . Panicking , he called her around midnight on Thursday . June 1 , and told her that he was sending someone over to bring her to him in Texarkana . Mary has described what happened when she arrived : Bill was terrified . He was afraid the VVAW was after him , that the FBI was after him because the FBI knew that the VVAW knew that he was an in former . I tried to tell him that Donner and Jordan were n't going to hurt him , but he had petrified his mother , my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody , that whenever these guys call tell them no , we have n't seen him . Eventually , Lemmer 's wife succeeded in calming hint , at least to the point of agreeing to meet with Donner and Jordan over the weekend . His confession was recorded in two separate meetings , but once again the admission of what he had been doing brought with it no release . After the second session , he learned that Mary had left him . He was sure the FBI had abducted her to get back at him for his recantation . Her explanation is simpler : " 1 was mad at him for doing all this shit informing , and I just decided that I was going to do it , and I left . " She recalls that afterward , when she briefly went back to their apartment to fetch her things , she found the walls covered with Lemmer 's macabre drawings and a series of index cards reading " PVS Post-Vietnam Syndrome Kills . " Other witnesses testify that during this time Lemmer carried a pistol and slept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI that when Dick O'Connell called him at home . Lemmer asked a friend who had answered the phone to say that he was out . This changed , however , on June 8 when Lemmer was officially informed that his wife was bringing a divorce action against him . The news quickly drove him back to the Bureau for help . After advising him that there was no ground fur a kidnapping charge , agents persuaded him to report her as a missing person . Still , he could not break with the VVAW , though his behavior was becoming more and more bizarre . According to Martin Jordan , Lemmer would wake him up in the middle of the night to say that the FBI was on the way over , that they were searching for Mary . and that if Jordan knew where she was , he had better tell her to do something . Shortly thereafter , on the basis of several affidavits testifying to Lemmer 's around-the-clock gun toting and threats to kill himself and others , the young veteran was placed in custodial confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Robert Hoard told the court that he did not feel that Lemmer was a threat to either himseh or others , but he strongly urged that he seek psychiatric help once he was released . Lemmer failed to take the doctor 's advice ; instead he fled to Oklahoma and shortly thereafter wrecked his car is a collision with a horse and rider that left the horse deac and the rider seriously injured . A few clays later , on June 29 , his wife received a letter demanding her return arm insisting that they move away and change their identities The letter adds : Today I have gone to meet with the Asst . Attourne.y sic General of the U.S.8 ? very soon , people will begin to feel the results of this . Do not pass this along to them , unless you want to see them try to kill me ? they would *This may have been when Lemmer provided the testimon that later led to the indictment of the VVAW leaders at Gaines ville for conspiracy to break up the Republican Convention . of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making me run a bit more . When I stop , they will have more trouble than they can handle . In a second letter to her , written the same day , he seems to be trying to placate his friends in the VVAW , for he now claims that 95 per cent of what he told Donner and Martin was lies . At the same time , he goes on to say that he , their former protector , has become an avenger : I f you choose to stay with those people you call beautiful , remember who they are playing with . I am not a goddamned leg infantryman like them . I am an elitist fucking paratrooper , a Special Forces type ranger . f you must tell them anything , tell them to keep one eve over their shoulders at all times . Because one evening soon , they 'll see the satisfying sic smile of mine . But only if they 're fast ... Let them now walk softly , lest they fall . Tired people make mistakes . Tell them to sleep lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have destroyed my desire to do so . They will soon know what can come down from having me for an enemy in place of a friend . Who are the victims ? HIS ACCOUNT OF William Lennner 's career as an in-I former for the F13/ would be incomplete if we left it as the story of one tormented man who may indeed have been , as he himself seemed to sense , yet another of the victims of PVS . His history does point up the consequences of the war , in men and institutions , but it also illuminates very clearly just how far the FBI is prepared to go in carrying out its mission of protecting the security of this country . ' The Fayetteville resident FBI agent investigated Lemmer 's Army record before recruiting him as a spy . He must have known , then , that Lemmer had experienced difficulties in the Army requiring psychiatric treatment , that by Lemmer 's own admission on the public record he had been offered a discharge on psychiatric grounds . Added to this formal medical history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a function grotesquely beyond the Bureau 's competence . Yet the Bureau recruited him . Whether Lemmer was a psychiatric casualty of Vietnam or whether his service precipitated latent paranoid tendencies can not be determined . What is beyond dispute is that he desperately needed help , that when he came to the Bureau he was drowning in fear and sought rescue . After the Leavenworth County marijuana arrests , the Bureau " developed " this frightened twenty-two-year-old college dropout , probably already tagged as a PSI ( Potential Security Informant ) as a result of his prior contacts with the Bureau , into a full-fledged spy with extraordinary privileges . Lemmer 's unusual relationship with O'Connell can be explained in part by the immediate intelligence payoff to the Bureau ? but only in part . To a *It may be that , like many informers ' confessions . Lemmer 's account of his Bureau relationship= is subjective and self-justifying . But independent factual evidence corroborates touch of his narrative , and supplies convincing support for the whole of it . certain extent , it reflected a conscious effort to tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for power as a defense against his phantom enemies . The Bureau did not merely ignore Lemmer 's illness ; it knowingly ratified his fears and exploited them for its own purposes . It made Lemmer its creature by fostering the delusion that as long as he served as a spy he was invulnerable , beyond the reach of the law . Despite the Bureau 's formal strictures against provocation , it made Lemmer a provocateur by offering hint a risk-free outlet for his undischarged aggressions . The most troubling example of this manipulation emerges in connection with his obsession that the " invisible government " was preparing to pursue and destroy him and his fellows . The Bureau , far from disabusing him of this fear , actually played on it and harnessed it to an intelligence objective , the compilation of a complete list of area radicals and activists . In using Lemmer 's terror to induce him to betray his friends , the Bureau sharpened already unbearable conflicts and brought him in from the cold . But the fear that made the Bureau his ally ultimately made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the bargain , which was to protect him . No agency could have done this . But in his eyes , the Bureau not only failed to shield him from harassment but also ? through other informers ? replaced MI as a watcher and persecutor . It turned out to he the hated old authority figure in a new guise ; there was no place to hide ? except in underground cells where he could finally " range out freely . " The Bureau tried to manipulate Lemmer into projecting his fears and hostility on his targets , but in this it was thwarted by his personal regard for the VVAW leaders and his involvement in their cause . The confessions , first at Gainesville , then at Fayetteville , were really a triumph of this war-scarred GI 's commitment , flawed and phobic to be sure , over the Bureau 's cynical exploitation of his illness . Whatever patriotic or paternalistic justifications the Bureau may offer , the hard fact is that it debauched ? there is no other word for it ? a young veteran and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually and at this point ; there is no room left for an evaluation of the impact of his betrayal on his victims . But Lemmer 's story is really incomplete without at least a glance in the direction of his targets . Just as suspicion and fear set Lemmer on the informer 's road , so trust and the need for community bring people together to give meaning to shared concerns . Erik Erikson has pointed out that the life cycle of the mentally healthy individual is grounded in a " sense of basic trust ... an essential trustfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one 's own trustworthiness . " Whether considered as an inner state or as a way of behaving , this sense of trust is also the essential precondition for healthy social and political relationships . The price we pay for the political informer is ultimately riot merely the invasion of this or that formally protected right , but the undermining of our common life .                  @ @ @
