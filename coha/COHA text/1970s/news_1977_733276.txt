txt WASHINGTON API  --  Republicans proposed Friday the most drastic overhaul of Social Security in its history , with standard retirement postponed until age 68 in the next century and no earnings limit on pensioners . The complex package also would increase the payroll tax paid by employes and employers , beginning with a onehalf of 1 per cent increase in 1982 . It would bring under Social Security the 2.7 million federal government employes , including members of Congress , now covered by the separate Civil Service retirement system . Federal employes ore the major group not covered by Social Security , which now pays benefits to 33.3 million persons and collects t axes from 198 million workers and their employers . HEALTH , EDUCATION , and Welfare Secretary Joseph A. Califon ? said the Republican proposal would shatter " the solemn promise of the federal government to the American people " by reducing retirement payments by 6 per cent and by eventually denying full Social Security payments until age 68 . " At the same time that the Republican House leadership proposes that we break faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the Social Security system in the risk of bankruptcy by 1983 , " he said . HOUSE REPUBLICAN leaders , describing the proposal at a press conference , said it would solve Social Security 's financing problems for the next 75 years without an immediate tax increase or use of funds from the general treasury . The system has been paying more in benefits than it receives from the payroll tax since 1975 . Congress has started work on corrective legislation . Without it , the fund for disability retirement is expected to be exhausted by 1979 and that for old age payments by 1983 . President Carter has sent recommendations to Congress . A key one , to transfer $14.1 billion in general revenues to the Social Security trust funds , has run into heavy opposition , with the Senate Finance Committee on record against it .
