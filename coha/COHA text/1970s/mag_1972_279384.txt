It was the universal opinion of all that he was certainly born to be hanged . <P> - Henry Fielding , Tom Jones <P> HANG young Tom ? There were those in Fielding 's novel who smugly foresaw that amorous vagabond dangling from the highest scaffold at Tyburn gallows . Ah , but how soft women would have wept , and what praises bold men would have sung of his deeds . <P> No one has ever seriously suggested that a 20th century counterpart of Tom , Quarterback Joe Willie Namath , should suffer such a fate . But he has always been the same kind of rococo rascal that Jones was . As a child Joe Willie was , by his own cheerful confession , an occasional thief and vandal . In his youth he ignored his studies for the pursuit of pigskin and other cutaneous diversions . In setting a career for himself as a professional quarterback , Joe snubbed the St. Louis Cardinals of the older National Football League in favor of the New York Jets of the lowly American Football League-for a record bonus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules . His hair was too long . His clothes were too loud . His lip was too loose . There were wild tales of girls and booze , of riotous predawn odysseys through Manhattan saloons .

Playing on a pair of frangible knees , Namath-after the 27-17 win by the Miami Dolphins over the Jets this week-had passed for a career total of 116 touchdowns and more than 18,000 yds . <P> Even more significant are the changes that Namath is signally responsible for working on the structure of pro football . It was the purse-draining price war for top draft choices like Namath that led to the merger of the A.F.L. and N.F.L. in 1966 . It was also Namath who bluntly announced to a disbelieving sports world that the Jets would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl , then led his team to a stunning 16-7 upset that gave the A.F.L. parity with the N.F.L. <P> Namath sat out most of the past two seasons with knee injuries . That did not stop him from winning an estimated two-year , $500,000 contract from the Jets management . At the beginning of the 1972 season he set about earning it . <P>
