TIME 'S Jerusalem bureau chief Donald Neff assesses Menachem Begin on the first anniversary of his premiership : <P> It was just a year ago that the former guerrilla leader and ultranationalist Menachem Begin came to power - and all the worst fears , and more , of his critics have since come to pass . More than any other man , Begin has set back the chances for peace in the Middle East . He has proved inflexible , myopic , hard-lining and probably deceptive , especially in his dealings with Washington . <P> Under Begin , the slow erosion of relations between Washington and Jerusalem that start ed with the new Carter Administration have accelerated sharply . Begin has proved unbending in his determination to establish new settlements , even though the U.S. has urged him to go slowly . Under his aegis , 23 new settlements have been authorized or constructed on the West Bank alone , including the " archaeological dig " at Shiloh . In the previous ten years of Labor Party rule , only 28 West Bank settlements were established . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's refusal to admit that U.N . Resolution 242 applies to the West Bank , that hilly desert area that he calls part of the Jews ' homeland by " natural and eternal right . " The hope was that when he came to power , he would recognize the historic necessity of giving up the West Bank with its 692,000 Palestinian in habitants . A year later , observers wondered whether even such an optimist as U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis any longer held out hope that Begin will change . Israel 's leader truly believes that the West Bank is more important than peace or , to put it another way , that there can be no peace and security without maintaining Israeli troops on the West Bank . Among Israelis , that is a widely shared opinion , and Begin loses no points at home for his adamant stand . <P> During his twelve months in power , Begin has emerged as a mystic , a legalist , a man totally insensitive to any problems beyond those of Jewish Israel . He is tiresomely preachy in his talks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd fact-and-fiction litany of Jewish biblical and legal rights , his self-justification for Irgun atrocities and his blend of self-righteous arrogance . <P> Foreign visitors more often than not come out of his presence with a look of glazed incredulity . British Foreign Secretary David Owen almost certainly did say after one meeting with Begin , " I ca n't stand that man . " Though American diplomats put up a good front about their feelings toward him , other ambassadors are less restrained . One , when asked at a private party what he thought of Begin , observed , " He 's beyond the pale . " <P> Indeed , many Israelis are saying the same thing today , mainly because they believe he is seriously ill . Stories and speculation abound about his deteriorating health . He is known to have a bad heart condition and diabetes , and rumored to have just about everything else . Two weeks ago , he remained home for three days , supposedly resting , but widely believed to be ailing .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
