DRESS GRAY by Lucian K. Truscott IV Doubleday ; 489 pages ; $10.95 <P> The offspring of heroes often choose between emulation and rejection . In the category of the overreaching emulator , consider George S. Patton III . As an Army colonel in 1968 , he sent out a Christmas card : a photograph of a pile of Vietnamese corpses , with the inscription " Peace on Earth . " In the Oedipal upmanship of military dynasties , Patton 's father , the ivory-pistoled mystic brute of World War II , was a tough act to follow . <P> Lucian K. Truscott IV also bears a refulgent military name . His grandfather , who affected pink riding breeches and a scarf of white parachute silk for combat wear , was a World War II general described as a fighter who " out-Pattoned Patton . " Author Truscott 's father is also a career military man , a West Pointer . Truscott IV , 31 , has found a complicated way to deal with the family tradition . He graduated from the Point with a resolutely undistinguished record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a row with his superiors . Truscott became a journalist-largely for the Village Voice-and bent politically somewhat to the left . <P> Now he has accomplished a lucrative but ambivalent sort of revenge upon the military . His first novel , which has earned $1.4 million in paperback , movie , bookclub and other sales , is the nastiest assault on West Point since Benedict Arnold tried to hand over its plans to the British . Dress Gray turns upon a conceit exquisitely designed to offend the rectilinear machismo of the Military Academy . It seems that there are inverts at the Point , Truscott writes . One , a model cadet named David Hand , turns up drowned , his body naked in Lake Popolopen and showing signs , in an autopsy , of recent homosexual activity . But Hand was an expert swimmer . Evidence suggests he was murdered by another cadet , also homosexual . <P> The idea has great possibilities , but Truscott writes with the subtlety of a rifle butt . His villain , Charles Sherrill Hedges , commandant of cadets , is a pathologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan , an elaborate tangle of implausibility , is to make it look as if the academy 's superintendent had ordered the coverup . That done , Hedges can take over as the supe of what cadets call " Woo Poo . " But Hedges reck ons without Ry Slaight , a second-class man who stumbles upon the truth and then besieges it for nearly 500 pages , like Grant trying to take Richmond . <P> Although the story is a somewhat amateurish mess and the characters are made of plywood , Truscott 's book bristles with engaging , sometimes horrific lore about the ordeal of West Point , circa 1968 , its codes and disciplines . His description of Beast Barracks , the two sum mer months before plebe year that turn oafish high school graduates into passable cadets , has the ring of first-rate journal ism . Truscott possesses a subversively accurate ear for the intonations of officers : <P> " Outstanding , major . Damn fine work . <P> Damn fine . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
