LAND OF COTTON A story by Gilbert Sorrentino j OE DOYLE was horn a bastard whose natural father 's name had been Lionni. or Leone . I have no idea what man owned the name Doyle . Let 's imagine his true sire to be a loudmouth who spent his days in a candy store in the Bronx , reading The Green Sheet and betting hopeless long shots . When one speaks of the People , one must remember that Joe 's father is always to be included among them . Whole novels , inexplicably , have been written exploring such characters . Perhaps these novels allow them to persist . Along about the time that Joe decided that he would be a " writer , " his father 's name shifted in his head so that he came to think of it as Lee . In any event , he led everyone he knew to believe that he believed that the name was Lee . Ah , mystery . Why his father would have changed his name from Lee to Lionni was unexplained . but such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once an aberration is seized upon , its possible variations are virtually limitless : consider advertising . Soon after this , Joe came to consider himself , I swear it , a descendant of Robert E. Lee , and the dear old shattered South , the ; rand old decayed plantations , the beautiful ) 1d smoldering mansions became part of his aeritage . It might have been true if things had Jeen a little this way , or a little that way , ight ? So Joe perhaps thought of it . This spangled rubbish was useful to Joe 's ife ; with it , he could wrench his father out 4 roachy shotgun flats and busboy jobs in Torn and Hardart 's and fold him into pink buds that glowed with the light of romance . le was no longer the man his mother had of-en bitterly and mockingly described to him , n unemployed lover in a Crawford suit-withgo-pairs-pants and Woolworth 's rose-oil polade shining his hair to oilcloth , but a quixtic , footloose hero whose rebel blood drove im to disappear from the verminous kitchens t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ad this same imaginary blood . He kept all this glittering lost glory subtly in the background , exposing it discreetly when it could get him something , and functioned off its energy . It was indeed an engine of sorts , and did not at all interfere with his job , his social life , or his " writing . " Joe became what he called an artist  --  and how he loved that word ; I can hear him now : " Well , as far as Flaherty being an artist . . . " because to be an artist was to be the stubborn Reb in retreat . He began to write poems , actual words , count ' em , words , on actual paper . It was " interesting , " and admitted him to a world that seemed to offer more than the world of , say , numismatics . That the poems were indeed accepted as art has little hearing on this story  --  although I suspect that it is not so much a story as a minor change upon a common fable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who produce arty bits and pieces by which other talented and intelligent people are somehow nourished ; they get what they need for their ailments . Sometimes I think it is all nothing but Joes with their variants of sham honeysuckle and Alabama nights on the one hand , and on the other those who come within range of that nailed-together glamour . It is all exciting and everyone is very pleased . mesas and mountains , in the way that Robert Frost 's poems are about America  --  that is , these concepts were laid on like high-gloss enamel . One can imagine the scarred little table behind which the bard sat , his can of beer and black spring hinders at his elbow , reading , oddly enough , from a book of verse he had published almost ten years earlier , at a time when he had entertained a powerfully unreal conception of his gifts . He read these old poems as if they were examples of youthful aberration . Which is to say that he laughed at what he now considered to be their " boudoir sentiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico or Colorado or some other chic wasteland , he said , " I never knew what a long line could be , baby , till I saw those mountains . " You get the idea . Joe and Ed drank from a pint of Dant that Ed had in his raincoat , their faces fixed in a blank , intense look behind which boredom crawled and scuffled . At the intermission , they went across the street to a bar and never got back to the reading . Joe began talking to Ed about Hope , his wife , how terrific she was , how lovely , how understanding and intelligent , what a son of a bitch he had been to her , and yet , and yet , what good friends they were now that they were separated . I 'm certain that he even did a few time steps to the old tune that goes , " We see more of each other than when we were together . " He could be a master of nausea without half trying . She was doing well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the What 's Selling School . She really had great taste , Joe said ; she felt useful now , truly involved with the art world she had always just touched the edges of . I can almost see Hope 's lacquered face placid among the wares on display ; I can almost hear her telling some broke painter , desperate in his wrinkled tie , to bring in a selection of color slides . They drank some more , silent in the contemplation of Hope 's splendor . Then , just for the ride , and because he was a little drunk , Joe went uptown with Ed to see Helen . She had asked Ed up to advise her on the right mat and frame for a small ink drawing that she bad been given as a gift , and while Ed and she talked things over , Joe walked around the apartment , looking at her small and somewhat precious collection of pictures and books . Ile was , one might say , zeroing in on his intentions regarding this attractive woman . She was mature  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence or Barnard alumna who had been around . Life had used her , as she had used life , and so on . Joe felt as if he were strolling into a relevant movie , all pained faces and swallowed dialogue and blurred focus . He helped himself to another vodka and caught Helen 's eye . She seemed delicately faded to him ; there was something irrevocably broken about her . He slouched against the wall , gallant and aristocratic ; against the tattered and streaming gray sky of his mind the Stars and Bars cracked in the wind . On the way downtown , Ed told him that she was forty-two and undergoing chemotherapy treatments for leukemia . To Joe , this was an unexpected perfection  --  how could she resist , her tragedy upon her , the gift of himself that he would offer ? Joe 's opinion of himself was based solidly on his being a product of that solipsistic aristocracy that clumps itself about the nucleus of art  --  which latter gives it breath and rationale . His own poems were a small contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sham individuality , a dime a dozen . So was Helen . Joe did n't know this about Helen  --  nor did he know it about himself , certainly . Helen , in fact , qualified for him as representative of that breeding and careless grace with which his fabulous past was suffused , and she took her place in that misty locale where Joe 's father sipped juleps and played croquet on emerald lawns , the sun dazzling off his white flannels and linen cap . There was a patina he felt he could scrape and strip off her very person and place on his own in mellow and lustrous layers . For Helen , Joe was young enough to he interesting , but not so young as to be gauche and trite in his desire . So they became lovers . I do n't know how to say this without seeming either cold or vulgar , but Helen thought of Joe as a last fling . Joe 's feelings concerning Helen were , as you will have guessed , cold and vulgar . Concerning Helen 's past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacked and hewn out a lop ? sided icon that passed for taste , had achievecan arresting face , and had been twice marries to vaguely creative men who were moderateb successful in vaguely creative jobs  --  the sor of men who wore ascots and smoked Dutch cigars . In her thirties she had paintei a little and clumped through a few parts 11 off-off-off-Broadway theater ; a modern-danc class and a poetry workshop were also buriel in the sludge . You will understand that she wa a female counterpart to Joe . The one elemer that totally differentiated her from him wa the fact of her critical illness : death and di ease are impenetrable masks behind which th pettiness and shabbiness of personality are al solutely obscured . That we tend to forgive overlowc the flaws of the doomed probably saves us all from total monstrosity . But it must be borne in mind , however ungenerously , that Helen was a shambles of half-baked ideas , insistent on her thin skin yet an opportunistic traitor to her husbands and children , the latter now grown into drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea " of , for instance , Mick Jagger as Prophet with a moronic fervor . Young , young , she was forever young as she slid toward her death , brandishing a copy of The Village Voice . It is important to know that Joe thought , in the first weeks of their relationship , that it was his " art " that had seduced her ; it had always been his " art " that had brought him his platoons of rutting young women  --  it was a subtle hook that he used to snare them and then lift their skirts . And if " art " failed , Dixie vould materialize out of thin  --  very thin , inleed  --  air . When Joe discovered that this was lot the case with Helen he was nonplussed , hen hurt , then angered . She simply took Joe o be another charming and aesthetically inense young man  --  much like her husbands and previous lovers . She was right , but no one had ver before so squarely confronted Joe with he fakery of his life and its picayune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , so that their mutual interest lay in interdependent lying . Joe thought of himself as a " coterie " poet of carefully controlled output  --  and so did his friends . Now , suddenly , here was Helen , who with unfeigned equanimity treated him as the amateur dilettante  --  in Joe 's ease the phrase is not tautological  --  he was and always would he . It never occurred to her that Joe thought of his fabrications as poems . One night she said a poem of his reminded her somehow of saltwater taffy . That 's not bad at all . Joe was n't used to this sort of comment on his work ; he had never got anything like it from Hope , who thought of him as a serious and neglected artist , although she would not have recognized art if it fractured her skull . J OE AND HOPE had dinner together once a week  --  they were civilized and understanding and good friends and so on . How they rang and rang again each boring modern change . Hope was aware that Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her about Helen , and Joe had corroborated the tale  --  and how . In her mind it was a " friendly " affair , and somehow good for Joe : good , mature woman to discuss art with her husband  --  oh , once in a while they discov-ered themselves in bed together , but that was almost an accident , or the price one pays for the nurture of beauty . Over her shrimp cocktail she was reliably bright and engaging , Peck and Peck all the way , with plenty of small talk about some up-to-the-minute painter " into some wild things . " Her eyes were blank with that flat stare peculiar to natives of Southern California , the ocular equivalent , one might say , of a slack mouth . She had practiced for years to achieve it , God knows why : I suspect she confused it with sang-froid . Ah , she still had something for Joe ; he looked at her with false warmth and affection and she looked back , laboring to emulate his falsity . What moments divine , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Helen said one night of a new poem that Joe modestly represented as a " breakthrough . " Joe had been writing for five or six years and each year had one of these breakthroughs . His poems neither changed nor improved , but there was , in his insistence on aesthetic discovery , an illusion for him of amelioration in his jottings . Joe was one of those " writers " of whom one constantly thinks as a tyro ; then one day the realization that the person has been pottering around for ten years or so crystallizes . It is enough to make one a Yahoo . " I mean it 's very  --  clear , yes , right . Transparent . " Joe , in a rage , but silent , reclining on the couch under the ink drawing whose mat and frame had brought out its weakness , allowed her to unbuckle his belt and open his trousers . It was she who was controlling him ! What a bitch he thought her . He watched her face disappear in the lace of her slip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horny old bitch . He might as well have been a truck driver or a plumber or a goddamned teacher the way she so casually used him . A journalist or editorial assistant who wanted to write a novel ! God ! At that moment , he began to hate her , his spurious heritage stirring him to combat , gallant . She gently pushed him back on the couch and reached behind to unhook her brassiere . Old raunchy dumb hitch . So Joe began to speak of her , vulgarly and openly . at the bar in which he was something of a figure . It was a mean and poisonous place of third-rate painters , hangers-on , dedicated filmgoers , and arty idiots , pots and looms in every pocket , who were just passing through . The controlled and amused voice came forth from his expertly hirsute face , his Italian leather jacket was creased  --  so  --  in soft , elegant folds . He joked of her tremendous passion for him , her raging and almost " embarrassing " sexual hungers , the luscious nightgowns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic . He felt it almost his duty . Her tears . Her moans of gratitude . Where did they think he got this leather jacket ? Nothing Like an old broad ! He and his auditors shuffled and chuckled , a bunch of regular guys that la vie d'art would never change . His words punctuated the long tale of malice and vindictiveness and failure that the bar spun out endlessly . A S HELEN GOT SICKER , she made herself progressively more ridiculous by trying to be vivacious and girlish for Joe  --  who rarely went out with her anymore . She played right into the hands of his shabby stories about her , so that when they did meet someone that Joe knew , her behavior was such that Joe all but snickered and winked . He was contemptuous toward her , rude and arrogant  --  he assaulted her , getting even and getting even again for that " saltwater taffy , " that " transparent , " her sexual aggressiveness , the Italian leather jacket . Those ragged cavalrymen of his fantasy rude their broken nags out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would happen , Helen , with the pre ? dictability of melodrama . fell in love with Joe He was so delicate , so vulnerable , yet so proud At the moment that Joe realized that , he liec that he and Hope were thinking of " trying i again together . " He was precisely if not subd ; cruel . H E VISITED HER almost daily at the ho . pital during her final confinement bringing her flowers , magazine : books  --  once , quite unbelievably , h brought her a copy of As I Lay Dying : h had turned almost recklessly mean . What ws there to lose ? He occasionally held her han and felt generous and forgiving . I like to thin that Joe considered these small attentions it stances of a refined sense of noblesse oblige He of course went to the funeral in a ne midnight-blue suit : nothing could have kei him out of the first rank of mourners . What surprising is that Hope went with him . JI stood there in the calm morning , his face marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding useful employment , in a stri ingly severe black-and-silver dress that she ht bought a month earlier for an important ope ing . They were so anxious for each other tt they kissed and clutched and fumbled in t taxi home from Queens . Perhaps it was t first step to trying it again together .
