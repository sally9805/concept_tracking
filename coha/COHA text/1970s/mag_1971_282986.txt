POEMS 1968-1970 by Robert Graves . 90 pages . Doubleday . $5.95 . <P> <P> Cyril Connolly said of Hemingway that he " saturated his books with the memory of physical pleasure , with sunshine and salt water , with food , wine and making love , and with the remorse which is the shadow of that sun . " The same might be said of the poetry of Robert Graves , especially in his latest work , Poems 1968-1970 . <P> Like Hemingway , Graves was wounded in World War I , and , psychically at least , suffered the death of the verities that had existed prior to 1914 . Like Hemingway , Graves is a romantic and a stoic who believes that one way or another love ends badly . While no single image or object can encompass the trajectory of Graves ' thoughts on love , there is a Spanish drink that comes close to it . It is called the sol y sombra ( sun and shadow ) . It comes in two layers . The top half is brandy-masculine , dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , treacherous . <P> With Graves , love , like an army day , begins with reveille and ends with taps . Only wisdom and patience relieve the passion and the pain . Yet , this poet would insist , love is the disease most worth having , for its opposite is the doleful serenity of death-in-life . <P> Pondering the mystery of love , Graves never fears to ask an outright question . One poem is called " What Is Love ? " : <P> Is it a reattainment of our centre , A core of trustful innocence come home to ? . . . Is it primeval vision That stars our course with oracles of danger And looks to death for timely intervention ? <P> Another performs a lover 's autopsy : <P> The death of love comes from reiteration : A single line sung over and over again- No prelude and no end . . . Though love 's foolish reluctance to survive Springs always from the same mechanical fault : The needle jumps its groove . <P> At 75 , Graves has lived through six of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , most poignantly perhaps in dated but resonant lines that recall the roistering celebrants of " Armistice Day : 1918 , " and then closes : <P> But the boys who were killed in the trenches , Who fought with no rage and no rant , We left them stretched out on their pallets of mud Low down with the worm and the ant . <P> When Graves is playful , and he sometimes is , he is as cheerful and civilized as Auden . Some alphabetical intrali-gual fun in a poem called " H " produces as its last word the best word to sum up the quality that permeates this book : <P> H may be N for those who speak Russian , although long E in Greek ; And cockneys , like the French , agree That H is neither N nor E Nor Hate 's harsh aspirate , but meek And mute as in Humanity . <P> T.E .
