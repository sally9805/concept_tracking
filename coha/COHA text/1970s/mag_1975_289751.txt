Had previous U.S. gold rushes gone anything like the one that began last week , California would have been short of settlers and Poet Robert Service would never have written about the cremation of Sam McGee in the Klondike . Legally free as of Dec. 31 to buy bullion for the first time in 41 years , Americans greeted the opportunity with a veteran prospector 's wariness of fool 's gold . The caution seemed justified . By week 's end , after three full days of trading in the yellow metal , gold 's price stood at $174 per ounce on the bellwether London Gold Market , down 12% from the high of nearly $200 set just before G-day . <P> Curiosity ran high in many parts of the U.S. , jamming switchboards of precious-metals dealers and brokerages offering the metal . But actual sales were slow . During the first two days of trading , not a single sale was made in any of European-American Bank 's 104 branches in the New York City area . Trading was brisk on half a dozen U.S. commodity exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for frozen pork bellies , hogs , cattle and eggs . In the first half-hour of frenzied trading at Chicago 's Mercantile Exchange , dealers bought and sold no fewer than 452 contracts for future delivery-the biggest opening on the exchange , they said , since boneless beef made its debut as a traded commodity in 1970 . But speculators were betting that gold 's price would go down , with most contracts off $15 or more from their highs earlier in the week . <P> Further downward pressure on the metal 's price seems likely this week , when the Treasury will sell 2 million oz. from its 276-million-oz. stockpile . Purpose : to meet U.S. demand with U.S. gold and thus prevent dollars from flowing out of the country to buy imported metal . Buyers had additional reason to be hesitant . Several leading banks announced that they would not sell gold because of the costs and risks to unsophisticated investors . The National Association of Securities Dealers told the members to exercise " great caution " in gold dealings , warning that no federal mechanism exists to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks were outweighed by the intangible rewards of being among the first Americans to get in on the gold action . A Michigan girl , twelve-year-old Carlenne Brown of Bloomfield township , claims to be the first buyer of the yellow metal . At one second past midnight on Dec. 31 , she signed an invoice for a quarter-ounce wafer , bought for $52.79 through a publicity-minded Southfield , Mich. , coin dealer ; he obtained the wafer from a fellow dealer in nearby Windsor , Canada , and had it delivered to his shop by car and helicopter . <P> The girl 's purchase underscored the fears of some Washington officials that legal gold will only draw funds from more socially worthwhile investments : to get up the $52.79 , Carlenne cashed two U.S. savings bonds . As an object lesson in the personal hazards of gold ownership , there is the experience of New York 's Conservative-Republican Senator James Buckley . A vigorous backer of legal gold on the Hill , Buckley triumphantly plunked down $480 to buy three wafers totaling 2 oz. from a Manhattan dealer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At week 's end his wafers were worth about $430.
