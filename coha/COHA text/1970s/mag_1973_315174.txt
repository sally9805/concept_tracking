For the industrialized world , the slash in oil production by the Arab states has been a handful of sand in the economic gearbox . But for oil-exporting nations outside the Arab bloc , the move was pure serendipity . Almost overnight , as global shortages reached crisis proportions , the value of their oil deposits began to zoom . Yet the oil producers have resisted the temptation to try to pump fast enough to make up for the Arab cutback . Instead , they have cannily held output to roughly ordinary levels while sharply scaling up prices . That strategy is resulting in a kind of forced , massive transfer of wealth from the rich oil-burning countries that may spur economic growth in the mainly underdeveloped producing nations more than formal foreign aid ever could . <P> A rundown : <P> IRAN , a Moslem country that strongly opposes using oil as a political weapon , is the only Middle Eastern state to continue pumping at full capacity ; in the past two months it has boosted production by about 700,000 bbl. , to 6,000,000 bbl. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , in concert with the Arab states , it hiked the price of its crude by a walloping 70% , to $8.20 per bbl. ; it auctioned some oil last week at more than double that quote . Experts believe that another 20% increase is in the offing . As recently as 1971 , the same crude sold for a mere $1.90 per bbl . <P> Under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , Iranians have been working furiously to expand and diversify their economy . Thanks to the quickened flow of oil money , the government has announced that its $16 billion budget for next year-the largest ever-would be balanced . Rumors that a 20% raise for civil servants might be in the budget , though , swiftly sent retail prices up 10% . The government promptly ordered out " anti-price-hike squads " to warn shopkeepers against inflationary gouging . <P> VENEZUELA , which already boasts the highest per capita income in South America , is becoming even wealthier because of soaring oil prices . Petroleum production has been held to about 3,500,000 bbl. a day for several years . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign firms drilling in the country , Venezuela 's oil revenues have leaped from $1.9 billion in 1972 to nearly $3 billion this year . Since January alone , the price of the country 's oil has doubled , to $7.24 per bbl . <P> Venezuela is taking a second look at an oil belt along the north bank of the Orinoco River that has huge estimated recoverable reserves of 70 billion bbl . Until the recent jump in prices , getting at this petroleum was considered too expensive to be profitable ; the oil is so thick that dilutants often have to be poured into the wells to increase its fluidity so that pumps can suck it out . Now , because of the oil-price bonanza , the Venezuelan government has the cash to buy the sophisticated technology needed to exploit the find . At the same time , the government is being pressured to placate national pride by taking over control of foreign oil concessions before 1983 , when most of them are scheduled to expire . Says one foreign oil executive : " We are past the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
