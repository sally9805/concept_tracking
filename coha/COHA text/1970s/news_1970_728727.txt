txt The Interstate Commerce Commission announced yesterday that it had instituted a full investigation into " all phases " of the operations , accounts and financial transactions of the Penn Central Transportation Company and its affiliates . The commission made the announcement in Washington shortly after two Democratic Senators , Warren G. Magnuson of Washington and Vance Hartke of Indiana , revealed the decision by issuing a statement commending the regulatory agency for undertaking the investigation . The inquiry is the first of its kind since November , 1960 , eight months before the New Haven Railroad lurched into reorganization . Chairmen of Groups The Senators had urged the I.C.C . to make a full inquiry into Penn Central and the conditions that led to its filing for reorganization on June 21 during hearings of the Senate Commerce Committee . The hearings were held on an Administration bill to give the troubled railroads Federal guarantees of loans of up to $750-million . Senator Magnuson is chairman of the Commerce Committee and Mr. Hartke is chairman of its surface transportation subcommittee . " The American people and their representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts on this vitally important issue before one penny of the taxpayer 's money is spent , " the Senators said . Expect Delay on Bill The I.C.C . ' s investigation of Penn Central is expected to delay action on the Administration 's bill to put the Government 's credit behind ailing carriers . Earlier this week , Representative Donald G. Brotzman , Republican of Colorado , remarked during a House Commerce Committee hearing that " you do n't have to be a legislative statesman " to know the Administration 's bill " is not going to come popping out " of committee " tomorrow . " The investigation announced yesterday by the I.C.C . is in addition to an audit the regulatory agency has been making of Penn Central for the last several weeks . The commission this week increased the number of its staff making that audit to eight from four . George M. Stafford , the commission 's chairman , noted that the agency 's full investigation would enable it now to exam // ine the operational practices of the railroad and also would give it access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more than 60 . Mr. Stafford said his agency 's concern with the Penn Central situation " stems in large part from its need to develop better methods for forecasting and preventing possible similar problems on other railroads . " The commission will make its investigation under Section 12 of the Interstate Commerce Act . This part of the law empowers it to inquire fully " into and report on " the management of the railroad and its affiliates . The investigation the commission made of the New Haven 10 years ago took nearly nine months to_the complete . The commission found that " mistakes " of the management , led by George Alpert , a Boston lawyer , " had contributed to the deterioration in the carrier 's financial condition and its service to the public . " No Dishonesty Found The report emphasized , however , that its investigation had not found even a " single suggestion of dishonesty " on the part of any of the New Haven 's management while it was , headed by Mr. Alpert , who ! took over on Jan. 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuggle testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in connection with the bill providing for Federal guarantees to the railroads , Senator Hartke urged him to conduct an investigation of Penn Central . Mr. Tuggle heads the commission 's Division 3 , which concerns itself with the finances of the nation 's railroads . Mr. Tuggle expressed great reluctance to undertake an investigation when he was pressed to do so by Senator Hartke , who demanded to know if Penn Central had collapsed because it had funneled its earnings from ? railroad operations into real estate and other ventures not directly connected with transportation . Mr. Stafford said the agency expected its investigation into Penn Central would enable it to develop new reporting and accounting regulations . These regulations , the I.C.C . chairman added , would keep both it and the public " better informed concerning the operating and financial practices of railroads under control of conglomerate holding companies . " The Penn Central Transportation Company is a subsidiary of the Penn Central Company , a holding company that is not a carrier under the Interstate Commerce Act and is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his statement that Penn Central 's operations , now that it has filed for reorganization , were under the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia . He emphasized , however , that it also remained subject to the commission 's jurisdiction . In undertaking the investigation , he said , " we 're not starting any witchhunt . We 're trying to do something constructive . " He explained that the investigation could produce new guidelines that could be used as a basis for warning other Government agencies , such as the Transportation Department , that a particular railroad was in distress and might need Federal aid . In a separate development , Penn Central issued a statement elaborating on one it had issued Wednesday in regard to rental payments to its leased-line companies pending the appointment of bankruptcy trustees . In yesterday 's statement , the railroad said it did not expect the rents it paid the leased lines " will be used in every case at this time " to pay dividends or interest on debt , " except in the case of those companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those companies were the New York &; Harlem Railroad , the Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chicago &; St. Louis Railway , the Michigan Central Railroad , the Philadelphia , Baltimore &; Washington Railroad and ' the St. Lawrence &; Adirondack Railway . In another anouncement yesterday , Penn Central said it was reducing office forces throughout the system by about 10 per cent . This would affect about 1,000 employes . The railroad previously had announced it planned to reduce its total employment this ' year by about 4,500 " in keeping with business requirements . " A spokesman noted that there was some overlap in the 10 per cent reduction in office staff and in the general layoff of 4,500 . In Roanoke , Va. , yesterday , John P. Fishwick , president of the Norfolk &; Western Railway , issued a statement in which he said " it is too early " to judge the impact of Penn Central 's reorganization move on Eastern railroads . His statement followed one on Wednesday by Gregory S. DeVine , president of the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway , with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated to newsmen that the planned merger of the N. &W.; and the ** might have been endangered by Penn Central 's financial collapse . Mr. DeVine also said that , because of changes in the relative prices of C. &0.; and N. &W.; stocks since 1966 , when shareholders of the two lines approved the consolidation , the exchange terms might have to be renegotiated . Mr. DeVine 's comments arc understood to have caught Mr. Fishwick by surprise . In his statement yesterday he said : " It 's too early to determine whether an N. &; W.-C. &; 0 . merger will receive Government approval or whether the directors or stockholders of either company will agree to a merger on the conditions that will be prescribed by the I. C. C .. "
