In 1969 high-flying Xerox Corp . was so anxious to get into the computer business that it paid more than $950 million in stock to buy Scientific Data Systems , a California-based mainframe maker . Now the copying-machine giant is just as anxious to get out ; last week it announced that it would stop making basic computers over the next year or so , thus joining the list of corporate giants that have failed to dent the computer market dominated by IBM ( others : General Electric , RCA ) . Xerox deducted from second-quarter earnings $84.4 million in estimated costs for discontinuing the computer business , reducing its net for the period to a mere $4.2 million , down more than 95% from a year earlier . <P> Getting into computers looked like a good move at the time . Xerox was then diversifying into a wide range of products for its " office of the future , " for which computers will be a key , and S.D.S. had maintained a 50% annual growth rate for about four years . Even so , some Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ; one says S.D.S. " maybe was worth one-quarter or one-eighth " of Xerox 's outlay to buy it . <P> In any case , S.D.S. 's main business -high-technology Government contracts-went sour shortly after Xerox took over the company . S.D.S. never captured more than 1% of the mainframe computer business , and recently it has been losing $44 million a year . A Xerox study concluded that it would not be profitable until 1980 , and the company decided that it could not wait that long . It can rent computers for the " office of the future " system more cheaply than making them . Also the recession is cutting into profits from Xerox 's basic business ( copiers ) . A Xerox statement last week even predicted a " moderate decline " this year in profits from continuing operations .
