On New Year 's Eve television screens , Evangelist Billy Graham , sports-jacketed and gray-templed , delivered a fireside jeremiad . Citing the year 's woeful parade of scandals , crises and other miseries , Graham warned that the U.S. would experience even worse difficulties if Americans did not forthwith repent and return to God . " The only answer , " he said , " is Jesus . " <P> Throughout the half-hour sermon , Graham never once mentioned the campaign that was supposed to have been the evangelical catchword of the year : Key 73 ( TIME , Feb. 19 ) . As labored over for six years by Graham 's organization and more than 150 other participating groups , Key 73 was intended to be a broad ecumenical effort to spread the Gospel-CALLING OUR CONTINENT TO CHRIST as the slogan put it . But by year 's end most people on the continent had scarcely heard of it . <P> What happened ? For one thing , admits the Rev. T.A . Raedeke , Lutheran executive director of Key 73 , " it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,000,000 for the national campaign ; less than $600,000 materialized . Most of the money went for a television special and other activities of " Launch Weekend " a year ago . Local and regional groups , though , spent at least $10 million on Key 73 . <P> Controversy also upset the effort . Taking the evangelical rhetoric too literally , Jews were initially incensed by the " Christian America " overtones of the campaign . But Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum of the American Jewish Committee , one of the most vehement critics , conceded later that the fracas had actually promoted better Jewish-Christian understanding of evangelism . <P> Some fundamentalist Christian critics were less easy to appease , especially when 43 Roman Catholic dioceses joined Key 73 . The fundamentalists charged that the campaign was sacrificing important doctrinal distinctions for the sake of a watered-down Gospel . Its defenders counter that the basic Christian message is difficult enough to sell without ecclesiastical infighting . <P> Changing Lives . Key 73 's most significant accomplishment , apart from the distribution of 50 million Bibles or scriptural excerpts , was its promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordial meetings among such various participants as Southern Baptists , Roman Catholics and Salvation Army members and among WASPS , blacks and Puerto Ricans . Evangelicals were pleased that some Protestant liberals were again emphasizing " the need for changing individual lives . " <P> The United Methodist Church-one of the mainstream churches that worked most energetically in Key 73-is a case in point . Not only are Methodists once again enthusiastic about evangelism , but they now view it as a joint effort of all Christians , says the Rev. Ira Gallaway , head of evangelism for the denomination . This week , in fact , United Methodists will meet with two conservative Wesleyan denominations and three black Methodist churches in a congress on evangelism in Dallas .
