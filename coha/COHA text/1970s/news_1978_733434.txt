Andy Marks 's letter published . on Jan. 4 , A generous estimate of the total . cost for the 345 pharmaceutical firms actively engaged in promotion ranges from about $1,500 to .52,500 per physician . This is ' substantially less than the $5,000 figure noted by Mr. Marks . When promotional expenditure is qualified in terms of cost per ? product manufactured , the average promotional - cost devoted to each product is about ' 50 cents to $1 per physician .

To reduce exports would be to accentuate the quasi-recession in Japanese industry . To increase incomes sufficiently to close the gap through an increase in private purchases of imported goods would accelerate inflation .

' 28 , 1977 through my approach , Congress would allow taxpayers to have ' some say , without pleading poverty , about their own money . Working America is caught in the middle . They do n't want your " sympathy " or a handout . They merely want to keep more of what they earn for something as basic as the right ( and . financial ability ) to send their children to college or post-secondary vocational schooL Your fiscal computations as to whom my bill would aid are incorrect .

Prescription-drug promotional material is intended effectively to provide the physician with information which enables him to use the drugs intelligently and rationally . Indeed , promotion is limited by law to only those product claims that have been approved after careful review by the F.D.A. In fact , each claim must be supported by extensive clinical trial before F.D.A. approval . HOWARD G. GOLDSWEIG Asst .

Radio City ' Music Hall is going to close its doors ! Somehow this seems more dreadful ? and more significant  --  than the hard statistics of job losses and corporate move-outs we have been waking up to in the past decade . Children from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Editor : Anthony Lewis 's Dec. 29 column concludes with the statement that , " Prime Minister Begin and Israel 's - friends . have the obligation to remember the future . " The falseness of this statement is . typical of Mr. Lewis 's logic . One does not " remember the future . " , One remembers the past to better prepare for the future . One remembers how prior to the 1967 Six-Day War no Jew was allowed to visit the Jewish holy places in their ? Holy City of Jerusalem . One remembers the narrow distance between the pre-1967 Jordanian border and the Mediterranean Sea , which has always made war a tempting alternative for . the Arabs . One remembers the military advantage ' of the Syrians- on the Golan Heights and how they did not ' ? hesitate to utilize it .

ARTHUR GREENBERGER Flushing , N.Y. , Dec. 30 , 1977 You also suggest Oat colleges would be tempted to simply raise tuition by the full $250 to cash in on what you call . a grant . There is already a strong incentive for them not to increase tuitions . Because of their already . high operating costs , colleges are threatened by declining . attendance . The Report of the National Commission on Financing Post Secondary - Education concluded that a college can expect to lose . from 1 to 3 percent of its en ; rollment for every $100 of . increased tuition . A " worst case " potential of a 9 percent decline in students watild be catastrophic . On April . 21 , 1976 , your editorial ?

Stick by your conviction and climb aboard with those trying to help . Soon attendance in college will be limited to two groups : the too-poor and the too-rich . The group in the middle  --  the too-taxed -- will be shut out .

Cusick New York , Jan. 5 , 1978 As the Democratic Party Prepares for 1980 and Beyond To the Editor : The Democratic Party is once-again writing : rules ? for nominating . its Presidential candidateS , .. and not surprisingly is ' again ' involved in internal controversy , The most ' recent example of this is the work . of the .. party 's Commission on Presidential Nominations and Party Structure . ( Winograd Commission ) and in particular discussions surrounding the cutoff point for awarding delegates to the national convention . ' In. many states in 1976 a candidate who did not receive , 15 percent of the primary vote ; or support in a caucus . did not receive any delegates from that jurisdiction . The commission is carefully studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seating to the delegate selection process . Two specific proposals are ? being considered which would raise the threshold . ? : One would simply , raise the-threshold ' to 25 percent . The other would ? shOrten the period during which the - delegate selection Process could take place- and would establish a- series of thresholds dependent upon the . time of the priMary or caucus . Specifically , in the first third of a shortened primary seaion , the . cutoff- would be 15 percent , in the second ' third it would be 20 percent and in the final third it would be 25 percent . . Some see proposals to raise the threshold as an attempt to protect Jimmy Carter from challenges in .1980 . Two points need to be made about , , this contention . The first is that there is no magic threshold which is innately fair or will protect an ' incumbent President- from challenge . Lyndon Johnson 's ? experience in .1968 is a case in point . Second , the ' real reasons for wanting to increase the threshold have been lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party to function effectively , fairly and successfully is what ' the threshold argument is about . Having fought long and hard to put Presidential nomination in the hands of the electorate , the very reforms ( fair reflection and public financing ) that were supposed to do that now threaten to do just the opposite . In undertaking to write rules for nominating seasons after 1980 , the commission must come to terms with certain facts . Many Democrats run for President ; Federal campaign finance laws allow candidates who get 10 percent ' of the . primary vote to stay in the race . Because of , these considerations , a brokered convention is now more than ever a strong possibility . Given the reforms of the past few . years and given the propensity of the press and the public to shout " bossism " and " corruption " at anything , that appears to be closed or nonparticipatory , a brokered convention would be very harmful to the party and would most likely destroy the chances of the party 's nominee to be elected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a brokered conven- , tion , in a party as diverse as the Democratic Party , must rank along with the need to preserve openness in the party . A breakdown of the former makes the need for the latter moot . DONALD L. FOWLER Columbia , S.C. , Dec. 30 , 1977 The writer is a member of the Winograd Commission .
