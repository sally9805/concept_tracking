Living in the future places quite a burden on language . For some years intellectuals have sought a vocabulary to describe a society that has , in its own mind , passed outside familiar landmarks into unexplored realities . For a time , as the quarterly the Public Interest observes , the voguish literary modifier was " beyond " - beyond tragedy , beyond ideology , beyond capitalism . <P> UPI Now the new modifier is " post . " The Public Interest has collected 19 of the new signposts : <P> post-bourgeois , post-capitalist , post-Christian , post-civilized , post-economic , posthistoric , postindustrial , postliberal , post-literature , post-market , post-materialist , postmodern , post-organization , post-protestant , post-puritan , post-scarcity , post-traditional , post-tribal and post-welfare . <P> Although the terms are sometimes interesting and useful they have the effect of turning life into a kind kind of chartless supervoid . Perhaps the real problem is that too many sociologists and other thinkers have grown postarticulate.
