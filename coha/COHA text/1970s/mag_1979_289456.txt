THE AMERICAN GAME <P> Directed and Written by Jay Freund and David Wolf <P> <P> With so many talented documentary-film makers about , it is sad to see a serious budget in the hands of the hacks who made The American Game . The movie 's problems begin with its title : Since when is basketball the American game ? <P> The co-directors follow two high school basketball stars , a black from Brooklyn and a small-town Wasp from Lebanon , Ind. , as they endure the victories and defeats of senior year . The overall message is a real doozy : sports are a metaphor for society . From this profound insight , the film embraces all the sociological idiocies that Albert Brooks satirized in Real Life . <P> The American Game breaks the news that ghetto blacks are poorer than middle-class whites . We also learn that basketball teams play to win , that coaches can be tough taskmasters , that pretty girls and college recruiters fawn over the best players . If these tedious observations were served up in an interesting way , the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Game is a survey of film-making clichs . There are soupy graphics , split-screen effects , a platitudinous narration . The editing is so splintered that even the few potentially good scenes , those set at the heroes ' homes and locker rooms , are too short to allow the characters breathing room . There is also an insistent musical score that sounds like an endless track of commercial jingles . " You 'll have riches and fame , " intones the title number , " if you play the American game . " Tennis , anyone ? <P> - F.R.
