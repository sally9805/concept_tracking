txt Prison inmates ? long considered " slaves of the state " ? have won a broad range of new rights from a series of court rulings which would assure them good meals , safety , and adequate living space . A federal district judge struck the latest blow for prisoner rights this week when he ordered sweeping improvements in the entire prison system of Alabama 's Gov . George C. Wallace . " If the decision stands , it is going to bring about a revolution in state prison systems , " says a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons . Some of the standards being ordered for Alabama are beyond those provided even in federal institutions . A number of prison authorities say the Alabama ruling is the latest in a series of recent judicial decisions that have expanded prisoner rights across the United States . At least four states ? Arkansas , Maryland , Mississippi , and Massachusetts ? have been found guilty of violations of the constitutional rights of prisoners since 1970 , according to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions caused by overcrowding . In Florida , the number of prisoners has surged from 11,420 last January to 15,872 in December . Some prisoners there are forced to live in tents . In Georgia , prisons have become so crowded that " we 've reached the point that we ca n't let a new prisoner in the door until we 've released one , " says a spokesman . Five hundred Georgia prisoners were given early releases last October to relieve overcrowded conditions . Alabama officials huddled immediately after this week 's ruling there by Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr . to map their next step . Some of them worry that the judge 's orders could cost up to $100 million . " I ca n't tell you where it 's coming from , " said Robert S. Lamar Jr. , attorney for the Alabama Board of Corrections .

The judge ordered the state to : ? Serve prisoners " wholesome and nutritious " meals daily ? the meals to be prepared under the supervision of a college-trained dietitian . ?

Provide educational training for inmates to help them learn marketable skills . ? Provide greater safety for inmates by increasing the guard force from 383 to 692 at four major institutions ; also , take steps to change the racial composition of the guard force ( now mostly white ) to reflect the prison population ( now mostly black ) . Although the costs of this will be great , Alabama " is not at liberty to afford its citizens only those constitutional rights which fit comfortably within its budget , " ruled Judge Johnson .

" The court at that time affirmed free exercise of religion for prisoners . It guaranteed them access to counsel and the courts . It assured them more liberal rules on correspondence and visitation . It guaranteed them the right to petition for redress of grievances , and guaranteed protection for prisoners ' safety and lives . It also assured them protection from cruel and unusual punishment , and guaranteed group injunctive relief . Altogether , more than 1,000 cases ? most of them in federal courts ? dealing with prisoners ' rights have been heard in the past 15 years . Prior to the 1960s , the courts had maintained a hands-off attitude toward prisons . A precedent-setting case had been Ruffin v.
