As conniving femmes fat ales , Mata Hari and Delilah pale by comparison to female fireflies of the genus Photuris . Like other fireflies , these nocturnal , winged beetles send out short , rhythmic flashes of light as part of a special signal system that attracts males of the same species . The female Photuris practices a deadly variation of this ritual . It modifies its signal to mimic the flash pattern of different species of fireflies and thus lures unsuspecting males . Once they are in reach , the female devours them . <P> This odd bit of insect behavior was discovered by James E. Lloyd , an entomologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville . While studying fireflies on the ground or in low vegetation in the university 's biological preserve at Gainesville , Lloyd watched male fireflies on the wing emitting light signals . These varied in number , rate and duration from one species to another , as did the responses of the females perched on shrubbery below . Using a pocket flashlight , Lloyd learned to imitate the signals of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mating flash of a male Photinus , a female Photuris sometimes responded . When Lloyd switched signals , flashing the mating pattern of a different male species , the versatile female Photuris often began to mimic the proper response for the female of that species . In fact , a female can mimic the signals of at least three different species . <P> Locomotion Flashes . Lloyd believes that the mimicry is not always perfect ; male fireflies-apparently noting slight differences in the flashes and suspecting female wiles-are not always taken in by the ruse . But the female Photuris generally manages to lure , capture and swallow at least one male out of every ten for whom she sets her cap . <P> How did such mimicry evolve ? <P> Lloyd noted that the females ' responses to certain Photuris males are similar to the flashes the females give off when they walk , land or take flight . Perhaps these " locomotion " flashes were gradually modified to attract males of different species . In any event , the Photuris ' wide range of mimicry suggests to Lloyd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever suspected .
