Some of the other men who served under John Kennedy left Washington years ago , iridescent with the celebrity of Camelot , and found a measure of fortune . Dean Rusk stayed on to work for Lyndon Johnson . Rusk was never exactly part of the New Frontier 's clan anyway ; he was taciturn , stubborn , spartan , undeniably intelligent , distrustful of personal publicity , given to seven-day work weeks at the State Department . <P> Some even thought that his self-abnegation was a pose of some kind . But after L.B.J. 's presidency was capsized , Rusk withdrew further into his privacy . To have been Secretary of State was , for him , an honor without profit . Almost none of the bountiful lecturer 's fees and foundation posts that have rewarded other public servants descended on him . His checkbook was almost depleted when he left the State Department , and it is probably thinner now . When a Rockefeller Foundation grant he received last year ran out , Rusk accepted a new job as professor of international law at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Johnson Administration are unaware that Rusk is even leaving town . This week , with a few very private farewells and no interviews , Rusk is closing his house in Washington and departing for his native Georgia . In some sense , he goes as a victim of the unpopular war that he so doggedly and conscientiously defended .
