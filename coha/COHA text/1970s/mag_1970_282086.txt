Broadcasting 's big brother , the Federal Communications Commission , may have succeeded where Mom and Dad have failed for years . With its latest ruling , the FCC may just be able to send the country to bed earlier . The ruling ( which does not go into effect until September 1971 ) limits network programming to three hours during the prime-time hours of 7-11 p.m . Eastern time . <P> The idea behind it all was enlightened enough . Since networks now provide their affiliates with network-generated programs for prime time , reducing that supply promised to give viewers more locally produced shows . But will it ? Chances are that local stations , to save money , will merely bring on local news shows , and then let the late-night talkfests start a little earlier . The local stations may get wealthier and audiences healthier , but hardly anyone will be wiser .
