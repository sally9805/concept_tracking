Of the various types of cancer that afflict children , few are more fearsome than osteogenic sarcoma , a tumor that originates in the bone and spreads rapidly . By the time doctors can tell that the pain in a youngster 's arm or leg is the product of such a tumor , the odds are strong that microscopic clusters of malignant cells have already reached the lungs . Removing the primary tumor by amputation saves the patient from early death . But in 80% of the 150 cases of this cancer reported among patients under age 15 in the U.S. annually , a secondary tumor appears in the lungs within a year . In most of the cases , death follows six to nine painful months later . <P> Until recently , all doctors could do in most of these cases was to try to slow the cancer 's fatal course with chemotherapy . Now a new-though risky - way of using an old drug called methotrexate is improving the outlook for victims of osteogenic sarcoma . <P> One of the oldest of the anti-cancer drugs , methotrexate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cells ' reproductive cycle . In low dosages , it has long been effective in controlling leukemia and certain other cancers . <P> But doctors were frustrated for years by the fact that standard doses of the highly toxic drug had no effect on osteogenic sarcoma cells , yet left patients suffering various unpleasant and even dangerous side effects-anemia , impaired liver and kidney function , mouth ulcers , nausea and hair loss . <P> In the 1960s , doctors devised a new technique . Instead of reducing dosage to decrease toxicity , they increased it . Reasoning that only enormous amounts of the drug could attack bone cancer cells effectively , they began administering potentially lethal doses of methotrexate , following those with an antidote called citrovorum factor , which protects normal cells from methotrexate 's deadly action . Since then , massive doses of methotrexate followed by a citrovorum-factor " rescue " ( CFR ) have become an accepted method of treatment for bone cancer at several cancer centers . <P> Rescue Effort . At the Children 's Cancer Research Foundation in Boston , Drs . Emil Frei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Kennedy Jr . ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) , and on 20 other patients . Methotrexate-CFR treatment is begun soon after amputation . Patients enter the hospital and receive a continuous intravenous infusion of methotrexate for six hours , during which they may be given more than 100 times the standard dose of the drug . Two hours after the methotrexate infusions are completed , the rescue effort begins . The patient is given citrovorum factor , first by injection , then by mouth every six hours for three days , while doctors monitor the patient 's condition carefully and check the level of methotrexate in his blood . When it has dropped below the danger point , the patient can go home . He returns to the hospital in another three weeks , after his system has recovered , for more treatment .
