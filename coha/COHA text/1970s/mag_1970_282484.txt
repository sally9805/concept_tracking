A surgeon places an unnecessarily tight cast on a young boy 's broken leg and ignores his complaints of discomfort . The leg develops gangrene and has to be amputated . The boy 's parents sue the doctor . Another surgeon accidentally punctures a 40-year-old man 's esophagus . An infection develops , and the patient hovers on the brink of death . The patient sues the surgeon . <P> Once a relative rarity , malpractice suits are now common throughout the U.S. In California alone , such cases increased 4% from 1966 to 1969 . According to the American Medical Association , one-fourth of all U.S. physicians will be sued for malpractice before the end of their careers . Those most likely to be affected are neurosurgeons , orthopedic surgeons , plastic surgeons , anesthesiologists , obstetricians and general surgeons . Those least likely : small-town ophthalmologists . <P> Enormous Cost . To some degree , the increase in malpractice suits is a byproduct of medical progress . " The success of modern medicine has led many people to expect the perfect result all the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't get the perfect result , they consider it negligence . " Others blame the increase on a health care system that takes the patient out of the hands of a family doctor and places him in those of a specialized stranger . They point out that while people rarely sue physicians they know and trust , they often sue specialists . <P> Lawyers now reject nine out of ten malpractice cases on the grounds that they are unjustifiable . Most of those they take are settled out of court . Of those that go to trial , physicians win at least two out of three . <P> Even so , the cost of such suits is enormous , and sympathetic juries keep raising the ante . A New York State court recently awarded $750,000 to a man who lost the use of both legs as the result of a spinal operation . In Miami , Mrs. Ellen Roll won $1,500,000 in damages for a postoperative drug dose that left her permanently disabled . In addition , out-of-court settlements of more than $100,000 are fairly common . When Baja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supposedly routine ear operation , for example , his widow sued the anesthesiologists . They settled for $887,500 . <P> In the 1940s , recalls San Francisco 's Melvin Belli , " you 'd walk into court suing a doctor , and the judge would laugh at you . " Now many courts have made such suits easier . In several states , lawyers are allowed to cite medical textbooks as expert testimony in some malpractice cases . Under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur ( the thing speaks for itself ) , a plaintiff proves a major portion of his case when he shows that his injuries would not normally have occurred without negligence . In turn , the defendant is forced to produce evidence that he was not negligent . Doctors ' changing attitudes have also helped aggrieved patients . Though many physicians still fear ostracism or cancellation of their own malpractice insurance if they testify against their colleagues , growing numbers are willing to criticize medical error .                    @
