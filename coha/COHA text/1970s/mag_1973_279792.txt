Any sharp confrontation between dissidents and authority makes journalists vulnerable to attack . The American Indian Movement 's takeover of Wounded Knee has provided a classic case study . " It could have been settled in a week if it were n't for this horde of reporters , " argued Interior Department Aide Charles Seller . Said Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles Ablard : " The press has created a climate of undue sympathy for AIM . " Sioux Tribal Council President Dick Wilson , whose resignation AIM leaders demanded , excoriated newsmen covering the occupied village for responding " only to dramatic violence and anarchy . " Last week this criticism received an unlikely echo-from some of the newsmen on the scene . <P> Wounded Knee had become a kind of trap , particularly for television . It was obviously a major event that demanded thorough coverage . AIM leaders were so successful in getting their side of the story across , and so enthralled by the attention they were receiving , that they seemed willing to prolong the deadlock for the sake of still more publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering and creating news wavered . <P> " The story has been managed all along , " said NBC Correspondent Fred Briggs . A wire-service photographer went further : " We 've definitely prolonged the thing . " NBC Cameraman Houston Hall agreed , attributing the continued large-scale coverage to the public relations skills of AIM leaders . Indeed , AIM 'S Russell Means , for example , cannily orchestrated events within Wounded Knee for the press 's benefit . " Cameras over here , " he called out one afternoon , directing photographers to where bunkers were being enlarged . Then AIM forces " arrested " four men attempting to enter their compound . Released a few minutes later , the men were paraded at gun point with their hands up past whirring cameras , then let go . Learning that one photographer missed a shot of the men leaving , AIM guards forced the " prisoners " to re-enact their release . <P> " I first started feeling the Indians were staging things on March 7 , " said ABC Producer Bill Brown . " While they were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal council house and lit a bonfire . It was 60 outside . " Brown also thinks that on several occasions newsmen 's questions influenced the improvised policy of AIM spokesmen . At one meeting , Brown recalled , " I put the question to them : ' Are you setting up a provisional government ? ' " Shortly afterward AIM leaders declared Wounded Knee the Oglala Nation . <P> The cooperation accorded the press by Means and AIM Leader Dennis Banks contrasted sharply with the behavior of the other principals . Chief Wilson made little attempt to clarify his position and was often inaccessible . Federal officials on the scene vacillated between minimal cooperation and the release of bureaucratic handouts . While newsmen did not slant their dispatches in AIM 's favor , many did focus on the colorful material at hand-much of it handily offered by AIM .
