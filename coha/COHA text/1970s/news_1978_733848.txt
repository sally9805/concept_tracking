txt SAN FRANCISCO  --  Two years ago a handful of professional sleuths gathered to unravel o ' of the more bizarre mysteries of our Hbie , There was &retired; deputy police superintendent from Glasgow , Scotland . There was a former operative for British intelligence from Hong Kong . Then , there were the two Americans , one a former FBI agent , the other a onetime special agent for the Secret Service . Were they a special team of Interpol detectives assigned to trick down some cunning criminal mastermind like Sher o c k Holmes ' old nemesis , Prof. Morisrity ? 5 ' WERE THEY , like Agatha Christie 's Hercule Poirot , out to track down some fiendish murderer aboard the ' Orient Express ? Or were they perhaps engaged by some mysterious woman in black to discolor the whereabouts of her vanished Millionaire husband ? Indeed not . Nothing so mundane as murder and missing persons for these hawkshaws . Those sleuths were on the trail of even bigger prey ? an international ring of blue jean counterfeiters . What 's more , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were undercover agents for Levi Strauss &; Co. , the , world 's largest manufacturer of blue jeans MA billion in sales last year . " BLUE JEAN counterfeiting Is a **26;0;TOOLONG business , " said Tom Nagle , Levi 's director of corporate security , leaning forward in his chair at the company 's San Francisco headquarters . " And our jeans are the most counterfeited of all . " Indeed , last month Levi 's band of denim sleuths managed , after almost two years of investigation , to smash the most ambitious Levi counterfeiting ring to date . More than 125,000 pairs of bogus Levi 's worth anywhere Item $3 million to $10 million in overseas markets were seized by company sleuths in Switzerland , Belgium , the Netherlands , Taiwan , and Hong Kong , in what has been labeled " The Case of the Spurious Trousers . " " It took a couple of years of intensive painstaking investigation , but we got // Column ' I Private eyes hunt for bogus blue jeans // ' em , " Nagle said . As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a London court to pay Levi Strauss $500,000 and was slapped with an injunction prohibiting it from making and selling jeans " imitative " of Levi 's . In Taiwan , three men were sentenced to 10 months in prison by a Chinese court . Legal actions are still pending against members of the ring in Belgium , the Netherlands , Switzerland , and Hong Kong . " Those Levis would have sold for $80 to $90 each in eastern Europe , " Nagle said . " In western Europe or . Asia they would have fetched maybe $30 to $40 a pair . Jeans are in incredible demand in Europe especially behind the Iron Curtain . In fact , the highest documented price ever paid for a pair of real Levi 's was in the Soviet Union . The price was $140 . " ACCORDING TO Nagle and Roy " Bud " Johns Jr. , director of corporate communications , counterfeiters like to run off phony Levi 's because they are the " original ' blue jean . While Levi 's were invented in 1853 , Levi counterfeitign is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a 10-year-old outbreak of global " denimmania . " It is estimated for example that more blue jeans are bought and sold in Japan than in the United States . How does one counterfeit a pair of Levi 's ? There are various ways , Johns said . First , there is the gull-winged stitching on the back pockets , a registered trademark since 1873 . Then there is that big Levi leather patch just over the right rear pocket and the small Levi tag sewn into the seams of pockets of Levi pants and shirts , also registered trademarks . Then , there are the buttons and the rivets used to hold them on , both with distinctive designs and both registered . " Our trademarks are registered in 65 countries , including the Soviet Union , China , and even Bangladesh , " Nagle said , " When we find counterfeiters pushing phony Levi 's we go to the authorities and get them to raid the factory or outlet . " LEVI 'S FIELD agents overseas two in Europe , one in the Far East , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " Sometimes an agent will just stroll through several shops in cities like Paris or Rome and check out the jeans , " Nagle said . " If he spots a suspicious pair of Levi 's he will buy them and send them to our lab in Brussels . There they will be examined by chemists and other experts . They check the composition of the thread , the indigo die , the button burrs , and the production code numbers . " A pair of jeans will just about tell us where it was made . For example the denim in the Far East is a lot different from what we use . It is much lower quality . So is the thread . " What does a Levi agent do when he stumbles upon an entire floor of bogus Levi 's in a Roane department store ? " We never raid a place unless we are 100 per cent sure the Levi 's inside are counterfeit , " Nagle said . " Then , we never take an active role in the raid . We let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard rule all our investigators are required to follow ? if in doubt , it 's genuine . " ALMOST AS BIG a problem as tracking down the blue jean counterfeiters is trying to convince local authorities to maintain a straight lace after they are told they are being mohillfed tot Taid a store with illegal Levi 's . " A lot of them are n't quite sure how to react , but after they learn the kind of money involved in bogrui jean traffic they take their jobs pretty seriously , " Nagle said . On the other hand , in places like Thailand where the police must deal daily with multibillion dollar drug smuggling rings , it 's difficult to get them excited about raiding a Bangkok boutique which is pushing fake Levi 's , Nagle said . Few of the illicit Levi 's are ever sold in the United States , he said , mainly because labor costs are much higher than in developing nations like Taiwan , South Korea , or Thailand . " It Is also extremely difficult to smuggle them into the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy foreign markets who needs to sell phony Levi 's in the United States ? " RANKED JUST below Levi Strauss la sales are Wrangler , Lee , and Britania . Between them , the four American giants represent about ? 80 per cent of blue jean sales worldwide . Like Levi Strauss , Wrangler , Lee , and Britania are constantly plagued by blue jean counterfeiters . Things have gotten so bad , in fact , that an anti-counterfeiting coalition consisting of agents from member firms has already been formed . Levi Strauss &; Co. hopes the coalition will help to reduce the high cost of its elaborate investigative arm . Currently , the company spends $500,000 a year on corporate security and investigations , most of it overseas . " Here in the States , we find that a lot of Levi 's are hijacked in-stead of counterfeited , " Nagle-said . " In fact , according to police reports , Levi 's rank third behind liquor and cigarets as the most hijacked commodity in the country .
