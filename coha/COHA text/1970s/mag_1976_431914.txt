 |p491  Those Fiery Brazilian Bees THE BEES CAME ON US like a squall . At first we felt only the warning ? the pelting of a few sentinels against our protective veils . Then , as we drew closer to their hives in the equatorial Brazilian bush , the torrent broke . The buzzing of countless wings filled the air . The bees seemed possessed by rage . I grew queasy watching them swarm over my bee suit , embedding their stingers in the heavy canvas . Each was giving its life in defense of its hive , for a honeybee soon dies after losing its stinger . Inches from my eyes , frenzied bees clung to my veil and pumped their barbed abdomens at me through the netting . So many bees attacked National Geographic photographer Bianca Lavies 's cameras that she could not press a shutter release without squashing some ( left ) . Our guide , beekeeper Antonio Both , fled as bees stung through his suit . I felt a stinger pierce my glove and had to fight my own urge to run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phenomenal product of a bee-breeding accident . Twenty-six queens of a notoriously ferocious race of honeybee from Africa , Apis mellifera adansonii , escaped in 1957 from the site of a genetics experiment near Sao Paulo . Honeybees are not native to the Americas , but over the years Brazilians living in the temperate south had imported gentler European bees . The Africans quickly intermixed with them and procreated a fierce new race . Since then the African hybrids have spread throughout much of South America . Now advancing northward about two hundred miles a year , Brazilian bees threaten to invade Central America , and then Mexico , and ultimately the United States . Bee attacks as violent as the one Bianca and I experienced are isolated incidents . Yet at least 150 people and countless animals in Brazil have died in such encounters . The story begins ages ago , scientists speculate , as honeybees migrated westward from Asia into Europe and Africa , where they met different destinies . Southern Europe 's mild climate and , later , man 's beekeeping practices , fostered the gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , had to struggle with a much harsher environment , hotter and drier . They remained nomads , an entire colony following the  |p492  flowers and nesting in a crevice or in the hollow of a baobab tree . Their honey drew predators , including man , that destroyed the colonies they robbed . Only the most unapproachable colonies were likely to survive . The African honeybees developed into a nervous , easily provoked race . They have a marked ability to communicate alarm by releasing chemical secretions called pheromones . The odor often triggers an explosive response throughout the colony . African bees are no more venomous than others ; they simply sting in larger numbers , and a few hundred stings are enough to kill anyone unable to outrun the bees . Although highly aggressive , the Africanized bees possess one outstanding virtue : They produce large amounts of honey . On their native continent the bees developed into industrious workers , able to store enough honey during the flowering seasons to help support them in times of drought . The Brazilian Government had asked University of Sao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output of European honeybees , which had never produced well in tropical areas of Brazil . So in 1956 Kerr placed 35 African queens in an isolated apiary in the State of Sao Paulo , for use in breeding experiments . " We knew they were fierce , " recalled Kerr . now director of the National Institute for Amazon Research in Manaus . " Every precaution was taken to prevent their escapeKerr placed grids over each hive with slots large enough for worker bees to squeeze  |p493  through but too small for the queen and drones . These devices keep the drones inside and also prevent the queens from swarming with an entourage of worker bees to establish new colonies of their own . Swarming is the way all honeybees reproduce their colonies . By nature , African bees swarm frequently . Before an old queen and her swarm leave , the colony begins to feed a royal jelly to selected larvae , which will then develop into new queens . The first or strongest new queen kills her competitors and soon flies off to mate with drones from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secluded apiary did not know Kerr 's bees were dangerous and removed the devices . By the time Kerr discovered what had happened , 26 queens had flown with swarms into the bush . As the aggressive Africans spread out , their drones began to cross with the local European queens , outcompeting the domestic drones on mating flights . At that time many people in the south of Brazil kept hives near their houses . Suddenly these families found their bees turning vicious , stinging children , killing cows . African invaders also swooped in to rob the European bees of their honey , or , often , to kill a colony and take over its hive . The Africans drove most beekeepers out of business . As one man put it , " Horrible things began to happen . " At times bees terrorized towns , forcing residents indoors . Choked with emotion , Lazaro de Godoy of Aguas de Lindoia told me that he had found the body of a friend with a thousand stings-on  |p494  his head . He had shot himself in his agony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Joaquim da Silva , 74 , of the same town . Five years ago a swarm of bees collided with him and his horse along a highway . The horse went wild , throwing da Silva to the ground and breaking his leg . Luckily for him , the bees pursued the horse ; it died three days later . African Strain Braves the Dry North Honeybees were virtually unknown in the hot , arid northeast of Brazil until the Africanized bees arrived about nine years ago . " It 's incredible how many bees we have in the bush now , " a farmer complained to Bianca and me in Ceara , a northern state . " Bees have killed 18 people in this state , " a ministry of agriculture aide told us . " Many more have been attacked . How many animals have they killed ? Surely thousands . This falls hard on our poor people . " In July of 1975 bees killed a teacher in the city of Aracaju . There I learned the details . A bee stung Dr. Eglantina Portugal as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee apparently released its alarm odor ; swarms in nearby trees responded . " Suddenly hundreds , thousands of bees appeared , " a witness told me . " Dr. Eglantina ran , but she had a lame leg . She tripped and fell into a ditch . She crawled out . I could see many bees on her face and neck . More bees were coming all the time . " I wanted to help , but it was impossible to leave my closed car ; bees were all over it . Some people from nearby houses arrived with @#  |p495  water , but the bees stung them and drove them back . Finally firemen arrived , but they , too , ran away with bees all over them . They returned waving smoking torches and were able to get Dr. Eglantina to the hospital . But it was too late . " During the swarming that follows the annual rains , bee incidents are common , especially in the country . City people have learned to call the bombeiros , or firemen , to kill invading swarms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortaleza bombeiro told me . Soccer games are sometimes interrupted by swarms of bees that settle in the stadium . When the crowd begins to stomp and shout , agitated insects attack the spectators . In the Amazonian delta town of Soure , a jubilant celebrant in a procession honoring Those Fiery Brazilian Bees the local patron saint fired a pistol into the air . The shot excited a swarm in the trees . The bees descended . End of procession . In Rio Grande do Norte , drivers of sugarcane cutting machines now wear bee veils . Syrup from cut stalks draws bees , which become frenzied by the rumbling vehicles . " I was plowing with my tractor , " Natanael Soares Fereira told us near Goianinha . " I must have driven over a nest . I felt a few stings on my leg . I looked behind me ; the sky was dark with bees . God gave me legs to run , and I used them that day . I let my machine run free , and the bees chased it . It was hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who teaches agricultural technology in Natal , said that two local men had been killed recently while  |p498  clearing land . " We protect our people with heavy suits and veils . But it is so hot , the people take them off . This is how they are killed . Bees make land clearing expensive . The workers demand more money . " Honey Hunters ' Defense : Alcohol Oddly , the African bee has brought to northern Brazil one of the most primitive forms of livelihood : A number of peasants have become meleiros ? wild-honey hunters . Francisco Soares da Costa ( page 500 ) lives in grim poverty with at least a dozen children and grandchildren in a mud hut near Aracati . He explained how , during the four-month honey season , he uses smoke to chase the bees away from their nests long enough for him to extract their honey . Often meleiros begin their day by drinking . Alcohol , they allege , counteracts the forty or more stings they receive going after a colony . " Sometimes my husband comes home stung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife , Maria , told me . For his efforts Francisco harvests some 130 gallons of honey a season . He can sell that for about 100 dollars ? most of his income for the year . Francisco 's hardships so moved Bianca that as soon as she returned from Brazil she sent him a bee suit . As the wild bees have moved northward , the perils have subsided in southern Brazil , where stories of terror and stinging death are now largely memories . Commercial beekeelpers have moved their hives far from populous areas . Many wild colonies have been era cated . And , as the Africanized bee has co tinued to cross with the European , the form has grown markedly less aggressive . T cooler climate , also , may have helped tone down its temper . Many beekeepers now praise the very bee they cursed five years ago . They have discovered that some African genes are good for honey production . " The Africanized bee is the only one I want now , " said Dr. Paulo Sommer , president of the Beekeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much honey . " Thus the Africanized bee promises to become a new resource not only for Brazil , but also for many lean and hungry lands throughout the tropical and subtropical world . But it can still be aggressive . The beekeepers usually wear bee suits and veils now and practice continual genetic selection . Whenever a hive becomes overly aggressive , the beekeeper replaces its queen with a gentler one . The apiary queens often mate with Africanized drones from the bush , and after several generations the African traits frequently build up too strongly . Africanized bees are physically almost identical to European bees , yet even my untrained eye could tell that the bees in Dr. Sommer 's apiary , like all bees in Brazil  |p499  today , varied widely in behavior . Some hives seemed to ignore us , while defenders from others boiled out at us , braving heavy doses of smoke . Interestingly , none of the bees actually Stung us . Dr. Sommer explained that because : t was winter in Parana , the colonies were - mall ; presumably the workers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is warm and the hives are strong and full of brood and honey , " he said . " You 'll see some aggressive bees . " Feisty Insects Heading Northward We left Dr. Sommer and flew north to neighboring French Guiana to meet with University of Kansas entomologist Orley Taylor , who is studying the bees ' advance for the United States Department of Agriculture . The front line , Dr. Taylor said , has reached Surinam ( map , page 495 ) . And with few European strains in this region to dilute the genes , the bees seem almost pure Africans . They are moving slowly now , however ? probably because the dense forests and heavy rains of the Guiana region create poor conditions for forage . " Within two years they should reach the more hospitable terrain of Venezuela , " Dr. Taylor said . " I think they will build up large populations there and move rapidly , reaching Panama in about seven years . Then it will probably be clear sailing through Mexico . " The best current estimate would place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 1990 's . However , imponderables such as unexpected predators or diseases could slow their march . On the other hand , warns Dr. Taylor , " We ca n't discount that someone , say a misguided beekeeper in Mexico or the United States , might sneak some in because they are such good honey producers in warmer areas . " Most U. S. experts are counting on Mexico , which has a large European-bee industry , to tone down the invaders genetically . " We hope that whatever forces operated on the bees in southern Brazil will operate on them in Mexico , " explained Dr. Charles D. Michener , University of Kansas entomologist . Some scientists favor creating a genetic barrier by releasing droves of gentle bees near the narrow Isthmus of Panama . But would Panama permit it ? Also , would European bees prove effective competitors in the tropical wilds ? Dr. Taylor , for one , believes that the bees have a chance of reaching the United States relatively unchanged . What then ? The Brazilian experience proves that the bees ' aggressiveness can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , it will take at least several years of interbreeding and sophisticated beekeeping . No one knows how much North America 's cooler climate will mollify the bees . Honeybees and their relatives already kill  |p501  twice as many people in the United States as do venomous snakes . In most cases the deaths are allergic reactions , often to a single sting . Nonetheless it must be stressed that no honeybee stings except in defense of itself or its hive . The African instinct is simply to overreact to disturbances anywhere near the hive . So the nervous African genes would result in more accidental deaths , but certainly no widespread menace . The new bees could have a less sensational , but potentially severe impact on agriculture . Honeybees account for about 80 percent of insect pollination in the U. S. They affect 90 major crops , including alfalfa , the primary feed of the livestock and dairy industries . With the honeybee 's value estimated as high as six billion dollars a year , the invaders must not be attacked with pesticides . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables would be seriously reduced , " said Marshall Levin of the U. S. Department of Agriculture . Pesticides and the dwindling of open space have already put bees in such short supply that commercial beekeepers now sell pollination services . They cart truckloads of hives from one flowering crop to the next . " If our honeybees become at all like the ones in Brazil , it will be a catastrophe , " John Allred , a California beekeeper , predicted . " We beekeepers could gear up to handle them , but the irrigators , harvesters , and tractor drivers ? the people who have to work in the fields ? would have an awful time . " An aggressive bee would force many of the country 's 200,000 amateur beekeepers to drop their hobby . " People who play with bees are not going to work with wild beasts , " said Marshall Levin . Bee experts seem more concerned about other African traits , which hybridizing apparently has not altered . For one thing , while the African hybrids work in far cooler temperatures than European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Europeans cluster into a ball , and by constant movement keep their temperature at 96 ? F. , thus surviving extreme cold . Bee Threat to U. S. Remains Uncertain This inability to winter over will confine the natural spread of the African genes to warmer regions : in the East as far north as Charleston , for example , and in California north to San Francisco . However , these areas house the bulk of the bee-breeding industry , which every spring sends bees to the North and Canada . Africanized bees could devastate this industry because few Northerners would order aggressive bees that can not survive the winter . The migratory nature and excessive swarming of the nervous African hybrids also concern bee scientists . When colonies swarm frequently , they stay small . Beekeepers , particularly those who truck their hives around to pollinate crops , might have trouble keeping Africanized hybrids ; absconding bees would create more wild colonies , and thus more stinging accidents . Such problems are today only guesswork . Indeed some scientists say it is folly to speculate , that nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But having been attacked for more than two hours by these bees , I have great respect for their persistence . As for changing their nature , I recall what Dr. Norman Gary of the University of California at Davis told me : " We do n't understand aggression in our own species . How much less we know about it in this little insect ! "
