txt President Carter prayed for it , Labor Secretary Ray Marshall hoped for it and Arnold R. Miller , the union president , predicted today that it would happen : that the 160,000 striking coal miners would agree to the terms of Friday night 's tentative settlement and end their 83-day coal walkout . The President joined prayers for the contract 's ratification this morning at Washington 's First Baptist Church , where the- Rev. Charles Trentham , the pastor , led the congregation in a plea to God " for strong courage , clear guidance and full intellect " to guide the striking miners in casting their votes . The voting is expected to start next . weekend and end Monday . Speaking to newsmen on the church steps after the service , Mr. Carter said he thought the contract ratification had " a good chance . " He . said Friday that if it failed he would have to take " drastic and unsatisfactory legal action " to invoke an 80-day back-to-work court order under the Taft-Hartley Act , which coal miners have flouted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " Face the Nation , " appeared to take note of the miners ' traditional resistance to outside advice by saying that this was " a handsoff time " for the Government . ' Up to the Miners ' " The decision is now up to the miners , " he said , " and that 's the way it should be . " Mr. Miller , whose presidency is under strong attack , called the agreement " a contract we can live with " and said , " I think our members understand that in collective bargaining you do n't get everything you want . " About 200,000 copies of the proposed contract were being rushed into type in Indianapolis , for distribution to the membership in the hope of averting misunderstandings like those that brought defeat yesterday and today to the " pilot " contract , reached last Monday with the Pittsburg and Midway Company . Because that agreement , on which the industrywide settlement was based , contained " me-too " and " catch-up " clauses , the two contracts would be identical . Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently because both President Carter and Mr. Miller called the main agreement an " improved " version . In fact , the P. &; M. contract contained language deferring to any agreement with the major companies , so any " improvement " in the last-minute bar- // gaining here , was also guaranteed ' in Pittsburg and Midway 's final contract . On learning tonight that both the coal industry caucus and the union representatives ' were having difficulties , on short notice , in engaging large hotel meeting rooms , one industry official remarked bitterly , , " The union could use the Labor Department auditorium , because the Government has done everything else for them : " Anticipating tumultuous meetings on the union side , one U.M.W. observer suggested that the miners " meet in the Capitol rotunda  --  and charge admission . " Nevertheless , news of the Pittsburg and Midway rejection was reported today to be persuading some of the thousands of other miners that " their " agreement was better and should be approved . Both contracts provide for a 30.7 percent wage increase , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in added costs to the coal producers . Both agreements also nominally perpetuate the industry-financed U.M.W. Health end Retirement Fund , but they substitute a commercial health insurance plan for the so-called 1974 Health Trust , which represents more than half the fund 's income and outlay . Executive Committee Must Approve One effect of this is expected to be the gradual dismantling or diminution of the pioneering system of clinics and hospitals that were brought to scores of impoverished Appalachian coal towns in the late 1940 's by the first health-fund coal contract , negotiated by the late John L. Lewis in 1946 . The major coal operators , who have been represented in the four months of bargaining by the Bituminous Coal Operators Association , also must ratify the agreement  --  a matter of little suspense ; if the miners approve it .

The association 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratification , will not do so until after the miners ' vote . The association 's action is regarded as certain to be dictated by the union membership's.
