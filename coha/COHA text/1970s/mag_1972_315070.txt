To the coroner 's jury that had heard eight days of testimony , it was a " gross technical error . " To Dr. Jean-Paul Drouin , 50 , of Ottawa 's Montfort Hospital , it was a " complication . " To three of Drouin 's surgical patients , it meant slow , painful death . <P> The operation in question , a modification of one devised in 1912 for controlling incurable metabolic disorders , is chancy at best . It is based on the fact that shortening the digestive tract cuts down on caloric absorption , enabling excessively overweight people to shed pounds regardless of how much they eat . To perform it , the surgeon severs the small intestine near the end of the jejunum , or second section , and connects it to the ileum just above the beginning of the colon . This in turn reduces the length of the active small intestine from 23 feet to a mere 30 inches , drastically lessening the time it takes for food to pass through the system . This reduces the amount of digested material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liaison Lack . Drouin had already performed 59 such operations when he scheduled three more patients in one 24-hour period last May . During the 90-minute operations , Drouin apparently became confused . Working " up to his elbows , " as he put it later , he mixed up the different clamps he used to mark the ends of the bypassed small intestine . As a result , he hooked the ileum to the colon , connected the end of the small intestine to the jejunum ( see diagram ) . <P> Drouin had dead-ended the digestive system , creating a closed tract that could only be emptied by vomiting . One patient , a 32-year-old truck driver who weighed 385 lbs. , choked on his own vomit and died nine days after the operation . When an autopsy revealed the reason , Drouin brought the other patients , two sisters who weighed nearly 300 lbs . each , back into the hospital for corrective surgery . It was too late ; both women had already developed abdominal infections and other complications ; both died . <P> The deaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drouin now faces an investigation by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario , which has the power to revoke medical licenses . After hearing hospital personnel tell about missing reports and erroneous or unkept records , the coroner 's jury cited the Montfort Hospital for a " considerable lack of liaison between the various departments " and urged it to adopt better administrative practices . It also heard testimony about other patients ' postoperative problems ( one woman told of an overwhelming though inexplicable desire to eat mud ) which raised new doubts about weight-loss surgery . <P> Most doctors agree that the operation should be attempted only in rare cases complicated by such problems as high blood pressure or diabetes . Dr. J. Howard Payne of Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center regards it only as a last resort for the " morbidly obese " ; he has performed 180 of the bowel bypasses and lost five patients since 1956 . He has declined to operate on thousands of others . <P> Dr. Peter Salmon of the University of Alberta , who has lost five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more bypasses until all data on their value have been thoroughly reviewed . Officials at Ottawa Civic Hospital , meanwhile , stopped all obesity operations nine months ago .
