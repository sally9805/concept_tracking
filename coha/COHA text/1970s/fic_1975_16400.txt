FADE IN 1 LAHORE a city of beggars , prophets , untouchables , fakirs , tribespeople , British soldiers , starving dogs , holy cattle , camels and hovering kites . In her streets , marriage rites are performed over five-year-olds . Squatting barbers shave their squatting clients . Readers of Sanskrit sit , cross-legged , in the center of enchanted circles . Dentists draw teeth and surgeons take blood . Rouged corpses , tied to flimsy thrones , are carried by ecstatic mourners to pyres by the river . As the sun goes down , life drains out of the City through her Gates . The quarreling , the crying of wares , the praying , the wailing subsides . The City puts her finger to her lips at nightfall . Silence takes over - such a silence as no Western City , where beasts and men go shod , can ever know . Listen to the SOUND of a single heavy raindrop falling on a leaf . Listen to the YELPING of the pariah dogs outside the City walls . Her streets are empty - except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever moves - animal or human - predator or prey - moves furtively , in secret . 2 A CITY SQUARE - NIGHT bounded by two story wooden buildings in the gimcrack style of Victorian India . The Square is deserted , the houses dark and shuttered , except for one corner building , from the top floor of which issues a gleam of light . It is the office of " The Northern Star " . Out of the darkness , a Shadow detaches itself , scuttles like a hermit crab without his shell , towards the newspaper office , the greater claw clutching a sack . 3 INT . KIPLING OFFICE - THE NORTHERN STAR - NIGHT He is alone at a flat-topped desk , writing with pen and ink by lamplight . Moths circle the chimney of the lamp on his desk . His jacket , waistcoat , high collar and tie , topee , walking stick , hang on a rack behind the desk . A moth drops on Kipling 's writing . He bends forward and blows gently .  --  3  --  4 INSERT OF A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His sword and rifle were bossed with gold , And the peacock banner his henchmen bore , Was stiff with bullion , stiffer with gore " . The moth flies away . A drop of sweat blurs the fresh ink . 5 BACK TO SCENE Kipling sits back in his chair . He wears thick-lensed glasses , has a wide moustache and heavy eyebrows . He is still in his twenties , though not to be described as youthful . Perhaps , like Lao-Tzu , he was born white-headed . A profound observer of the extravagant doings of his fellow men and fellow beasts , between which he makes no strong distinction . A short story he will write some years later begins with , in fact , this line : " Brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar , if he be found worthy . " He will call it , " The Man Who Would Be King " . He wipes his forehead , gives the poem a name , puts it in a desk drawer and is turning down the lamp when CARNEHAN - or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; CARNEHANI 've come back !

You eat there behind your desk and I stood here and Danny here . Remember ? Look at me , Brother Kipling ! &nbsp; KIPLING ( realizing at last who stands before him ) Yes .

LAHORE RAILWAY STATION - FULL SHOT - DAY A swarm of travellers : Sedate Brahmins , shrill Vishnamites , Shivites with caste marks on their palms , Sikhs with daggers in their hair .

He rises  --  7  --  quietly and moves cautiously toward Kipling , but at the crucial moment the engineer clamps on the brakes and a dozen cars telescope in all hell and commotion .

Then : &nbsp; CARNEHANOut the window , Babu . &nbsp; BABUThank you , sir . He rises , runs to the window and begins to open it . Carnehan comes up behind him , grabs him by the collar , opens the door , puts a foot against Mr Das 's behind , and boots him overboard , shouting : &nbsp; CARNEHANOutside , you inky-fingered thief ! He proceeds to throw the portfolio , umbrella , and watermelon after the Babu . &nbsp; CARNEHAN ( continuing ; leaning out , shouting ) I hope you break your dirty neck !

There is the sound of water trickling across the floor into small channels . Carnehan goes forward cautiously . After a few yards of blackness , he sees faint light ahead . 54 CARNEHAN AND THREE AFGHANS AND MULES Carnehan moves towards the light . In a few moments , he sees that this is a natural tunnel under the hill - the wide outer exit a bright frame against the interior darkness . COMING THROUGH THIS FRAME are THREE AFGHANS . Two are riding mules ; a Third walks beside them . 55 CARNEHAN reacting as the sound of the mules ' hooves reverberates in the hollow vault .

He and Carnehan take off the goatskins they have hanging from their shoulders and any loose garment that can be spared to cover the sleds . From some inner pocket , Dravot takes out a bent , unworkable whirligig and , placing himself at the entrance to the Cavern , begins to spin and to speak his mumbo-jumbo . Carnehan assumes an obsequious attitude as the THREE MEN AND MULES ARRIVE .

The Two Afghans dismount . This encouraging sign elicits all Dravot 's artistry . He is now , as he boasted to Kipling , " foaming at the mouth " . Dravot executes one last spin , and sinks into a heap on the ground , twitching something fearful . He then does a slow roll onto his back , his eyes roll up into his head , and he goes " into a trance " . A moment of reverent silence for the afflicted one 's state . Then Carnehan resumes talking in Afghan , pointing to the mules . He drags a pouch from beneath his rags and , opening it , begins to take out one coin after another , counting .

Immediately before them stand TWO GIANT SHAPES and , above a cleft in the rock face of the cliff are FOUR MORE MENACING SENTINELS of equal size .

Carnehan marches out of step with him and Billy Fish out of step with them both .

Lining the streets of this monastic community are still more PRIESTS , ACOLYTES , LAY BROTHERS , SERVANTS wearing garments of different types and colors to denote their status . Their eyes are fixed on Dravot . The Spokesman leads . Dravot follows , walking uphill regally alone , gravely acknowledging the people with a nod of his head , his arrow swagger-stick tucked under one arm . Side by side , Carnehan and Billy Fish come next . After them , the delegation . The steep incline levels off .

His hands and feet are of burnished gold . Facing him , on the other side of the archway are grotesque figures of lesser gods and devils . Dravot and Company pass through the archway , come to a halt before some TWENTY TEMPLE PRIESTS gathered at the base of the portico steps The Priests stand motionless . Not a move is made , not a word is spoken . Dravot looks at Carnehan over his shoulder , briefly shuts one eye .  --  90  --  &nbsp; DRAVOT ( voice booming ) All right ! You got us here !

The High Priest reaches out and very gently takes the arrow from under Dravot 's arm , tentatively feels its point . &nbsp; DRAVOT ( gesturing ; to Billy ) Tell him he can keep it , Billy . Tell him I 'm making him a present of it . Billy Fish and Carnehan step forward and Billy translates . The High Priest nods gravely , hands the arrow to a Priest with a murmured instruction .
