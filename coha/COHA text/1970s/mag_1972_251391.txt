Darwin was a male chauvinist ; modern theories of evolution are speculative and sexist , and treat women as mere " satellites " of men . That , simply stated , is the opinion of Author Elaine Morgan . Armed with a vivid imagination and a healthy supply of female chauvinism , she has developed a theory that is even more speculative and sexist than those she decries . In The Descent of Woman ( Stein &; Day ; $7.95 ) , Author Morgan proposes that many of mankind 's current physical and behavioral characteristics developed during a period when prehominid apes spent much of their time on sandy shores and in neck-high waters . Led by females , she says , the apes abandoned the dying forests , found life on the open plains too threatening and took to the ocean , where they lived for ten million years before resuming a land-based way of life . <P> Fighting Canines . Elaine Morgan 's scientific credentials do not quite measure up to those of , say , Charles Darwin . A 51-year-old mother of three children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford degree in English and gleaned most of her information about science " from reading books . " Two men in particular inspired her . The first was Amateur Ethologist Robert Ardrey , the failed but imaginative playwright whose views she now rejects . The second was Oxford Zoologist Sir Alister Hardy , an authority on plankton who thought up a nonsexist version of aquatic evolution about a dozen years ago . <P> The flight of man 's ancestors to the sea became inevitable , Morgan says , when " torrid heat waves began to scorch the African continent , " killing off the trees and drying up the food supply . At the time , things were even tougher for the female than for the male : " She had a greedy and hectoring mate , " she lacked his " fighting canines " ( teeth , not dogs ) to fend off enemies , " she was hampered by a clinging infant , " and when chased by a carnivorous cat , she " found there was no tree she could run up to escape . " She " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your homeland 's turning into an inferno , the seaside 's not at all a bad place to be . " <P> It was in the sea , Morgan states , that the prehominid female began to walk on two feet instead of four to keep her head above water . It was also there that she-and not , as some theorists would have it , the male-became the first to use implements purposefully . Envying the male 's dagger-like fangs that he could use to crunch through shells , she picked up a pebble and managed to crack a shell with it . " She tried it again , and it worked every time . So she became a tool user , and the male watched her and imitated her . "
