Answer : Each is classified by the Internal Revenue Service as a not-for-profit , tax-exempt " public charity " and dependsupon private gifts to perform its services . Question : Of the various major humanitarian and reform movements listed below , which ones were initiated by private , voluntary organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Slavery , Women 's Rights , Prison Reform , Conservation of Natural Resources , Population Planning , Civil Rights for Blacks and Other Minorities , Care for the Poor , the Consumer Movement , the Fight Against World Hunger ? Answer : All of them . There are many ways to explain how Americans , through our history , have been able to achieve what we have achieved and to describe what our life is like today . Yet there is one outstanding theme for our national experience , past and present , that defines us as a people : The United States , more than any other country , is the land of private , voluntary initiatives for the public good . CONTINUED ON FOLLOWING PAGE , - That fact does not justify smugness , a sense of superiority , or national self-righteousness , but it is part of our reality . When we feel overwhelmed by our past collective failures , or by the complexity of our current problems , we should reflect on the vast contributed services of many individual men and women and the host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , have made a crucial difference in our common life . They have played vital roles in overcoming great and little evils , in taking care of major and minor needs , and in serving the general good . Yet , for some strange reason , they are generally unsung heroes . We commonly downplay or ignore the significance of private voluntarism , and we tend to exaggerate what governments have done or can do to solve human problems and to initiate constructive change . Government agencies , obviously , have enormous power and influence and serve incalculable human needs . Their proliferation and growth over the past 50 years has , of course , been related to the failure or inability of private group and individual efforts to cope with many social problems . The record shows , however , that it has been enterprising private citizens and the voluntary efforts and organizations they inspired that have set in motion most of the significant social changes in our history . Civil servants carry out the policies that are laid down for them by Congress and the state legislatures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important roles in proposing and carrying out governmental policies . Those policies are often the result of education and pressure . Private citizens , through all kinds of groups large and small , provide the education and the pressure . That was true of William Lloyd Garrison , who in 1833 established the American Anti-Slavery Society , and of the many other individuals and organizations that kept up the agitation until eventually a president was elected who was willing to issue an Emancipation Proclamation . It was also true of Susan B. Anthony , who in 1869 helped to found the National Woman Suffrage Association , and of that movement that finally won for women the right to vote . In more recent years , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , his Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and other civil rights groups kept hammering away at the consciences of politicians and of the general public until they forced local , state , and federal governments to adopt and enforce laws that have produced a real revolution in the political , economic , and social treatment of blacks and other minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous task done . The Sierra Club , the Audubon Society , and the National Wildlife Federation are but a few of the national and local organizations that have aroused the nation and set in motion a vast tidal wave of laws and regulations to clean up and protect the environment . Howard Jarvis and his private-citizen colleagues produced , in 1978 , a monumental turn-around on taxes in California through the Proposition 13 movement , setting off in turn a nationwide rash of referenda , legislative enactments , and political programs to pare the costs of government and reduce taxes . The point of all this is not to suggest that politicians are lacking in imagination or sensitivity or courage ; some are and some are n't . The real point is that in a democratic , society political leadership tends to be expressed in terms of the ability to sense the moods and desires of the people and to find workable ways to carry out their wishes . The best of political leaders will of course help to shape the public will in constructive ways . Yet all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concerned , informed , and determined citizens who are willing to get out andwork hard to put across the ideas they believe to be for the common good . Throughout our national history we have gone through one important change after another in which private-citizen groups took the lead and the politicians followed . When Count Alexis de Tocqueville toured various parts of America , including many frontier settlements , in the 1830s he was struck by what he regarded as an unusual feature of American life . In Democracy in America he wrote : " Americans of all ages , all stations in life , and all types of disposition are forever forming associa-. tions . There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part , but others of a thousand different types  --  religious , moral , serious , futile , very general and very limited , immensely large and very minute . Americans combine to give fetes , found seminaries , build churches , distribute books , and send missionaries to the antipodes . Hospitals , prisons , and schools take shape that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth or propagate some feeling by the encouragement of a great example , they form an association . In every case , at the head of any new undertaking , where in France you would find the government or in England some territorial magnate , in the United States you are sure to find an association . " Private groups have not estab-lished any prisons lately , but they remain deeply involved in schools , colleges , and hospitals . At present , we have in the United States about 4,600 privately supported secondary schools , 1,500 indepen-dent and church-related colleges and universities , 3,500 privately run hospitals . Private donors con-tribute over $4 billion each year to the support of activities in the health field . Of that amount , more than three-fourths comes from in-dividual givers , while foundations contribute between $400 million and $500 million . These sums may seem relatively small compared with the federal government 's an-nual health commitment of more than $50 billion and the total out-lay for health services of $160 bil-lion mostly covered by charges to Continued on following page patients . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's physical well-being . They help to provide health care for the poor , including those who have no medical insurance or are ineligible for Medicaid and Medicare assistance . Private funds still cover a substantial portion of the costs of biomedical research . They are important to the schools that train our doctors , dentists , nurses , and paramedics . They are vital in providing " venture capital " for experimental approaches to broadening and improving the quality of primary health care . Education , like medical services , has for most of our history been the responsibility of private institutions . The earliest schools and colleges were created and operated by church bodies , and they were scattered across the land with great enthusiasm , high idealism , and excessive optimism . Hundreds did not survive . Many became the nucleus around which was built in time a state teachers college or a state university . Despite the great growth of state educational institutions in the last 40 years , independent colleges and universities still outnumber the four-year , degree-granting state institutions , and still enroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two million students . The Founding Fathers took it for granted that private bodies , chiefly churches , would carry the basic responsibility for schooling the nation 's young . Although the United States eventually led the way in the development of public education , it was a long time in coming and its growth was initially slow . Throughout our history there has been a great blending of private moneys and tax funds in support of education . For the first hundred years of our existence as a nation most Americans simply would not have understood today 's depth of feeling over such presently controversial topics as prayer in the schools or tax support for church-related educational institutions . Until well after the Civil War , state or local tax funds were often , as a matter of course , used to provide at least partial support for parochial schools . Only with the rise of anti-Catholiccampaigns by the Know-Nothings and other groups which promoted ethnic and religious tensions did state governments ( including New York  --  despite its substantial Catholic population ) adopt a clear-cut policy denying tax support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been substantially modified in recent years with the adoption , in New York and in a number of other states , of programs of annual scholarship assistance and other types of grants for accredited independent and church-related colleges . Most states now make available out of state funds aid for qualified and needy residents who wish to attend independent and church-related institutions within their home state . This blurring of the lines between " private " and " public " in the field of education has taken many forms over the years . When a village on cut . . inure of Lake Erie ( early Cleveland ) decided about 1820 to build a one-room school , there was no board of education , no school budget , and only very limited tax funds . The people of the community did what local citizens did in early settlements all across the land . They pitched in on a volunteer basis , cut the timber , hauled and shaped the stones , and erected the building virtually without monetary cost . The total cash outlay was $26 for glass , nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody gave a thought as to whether this was a public or a private project . It was often both . When people wanted a school , they either built one under the sponsorship of a church , or , as a community , they made it a project of neighbors and of the local unit of government . They drew upon whatever resources of manpower and money they could tap to get the job done . To this day , virtually every PTA in the land has its fund-raising projects to supplement the school board 's tax dollars and add facilities and services to the public schools . Practically every state university now has its semi-independent university foundation that seeks gifts and grants to augment the tax moneys voted by the state legislature . Meanwhile , the Harvards and the Princetons , the Oberlins and the Pomonas , though independent of government control , work away diligently and successfully to secure public funds for their students , their research , and various phases of their educational programs . Presbyterian Princeton , incidentally , almost 200 years ago , received what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government support . On at least one occasion , the legislators of New Jersey authorized a lottery , the net proceeds of which would go for the benefit of Princeton . ( Benjamin Franklin 's print shop got the order to print the tickets . ) The point of all this is not to suggest that there is not significant difference between a public and a private institution , nor to intimate that all worthy causes should draw tax support . But there is a lesson here worth pondering . It is that in almost every phase of life in America there is an intermingling of volunteer services and the work of government-paid employees , of private gifts with tax dollars ; that many governmental operations would not function very well without significant input from the private sector ; that many " public " services are in fact provided by private organizations ; that what have been traditionally called private organizations are sometimes intimately involved with and even financially dependent upon government agencies and government moneys ; and that the role of volunteers is a huge and important one throughout our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of situation helps to amaze and bewilder foreign observers who try to understand the American way of life . It is , also , to tell the truth , a bit confusing to some Americans , particularly those caught up in some kind of statist vision of the day when governmental entities will take over the functions of most of these private institutions and when , with enough staff and tax money , all human problems will be solved . For all their historic roots and their continuing vast strength , private , nongovernmental initiatives are not universally admired and trusted . There are sincere Americans who honestly believe that government agencies can do most things better , despite a lot of contrary evidence . There are those who point to occasional examples of bad management of private organizations or misapplication of funds , and of course there are rotten apples in these particular barrels , as well as in most others . Then , too , from time to time , it becomes evident that some people simply look upon many philanthropic activities as the games that rich people play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dedicated to the general good , should be broken up and taken over by government . There are those who believe that any social need that individuals ca n't provide for themselves should be provided through government channels . The anti-philanthropy attitudes have by now largely triumphed in many parts of the world , including some of the democratic countries of Western Europe . The New York Times made a survey of the subject in 1978 and reported that in countries like Sweden and France there is a widely held view that it is somehow indecent , if not immoral and illegal , for a wealthy person to contribute some major facility or service to his home community . It is argued that if any social service , facility , or cultural program is needed , it should be provided by the state through tax moneys . Even the king of Sweden was publicly rebuked for his audacity in offering to provide from his own pocket funds to help carry out some worthy civic project . We have not come to that state of mind yet in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim their support of free enterprise and of a pluralistic society do not really understand how a pluralistic society works and how important are the varied private initiatives for the public good . We need to be making a fresh and searching examination of the whole broad role of voluntarism in American life , of the relationships between those initiatives and governmental activities , of the most appropriate policies to foster the right balance of private and public institutions , and of how best to serve the public good . For too long we have taken volunteer activities and organizations for granted . All too often , particularly over the last 50 years , governmental bodies have gone charging ahead in one field after another with scant regard for how those actions may affect the public services already being provided by private institutions long at work in those areas . Public/ private cooperation is frequently only a halfhearted afterthought . Those who make and administer the tax laws at times pay almost no attention to the impact their policies and actions may have on the flow of private gifts to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time and money to meet public needs . The right of taxpayers to take charitable deductions for their gifts to educational , religious , scientific , and social welfare agencies has long been embedded in the federal tax code . Thanks to that kind of incentive , billions of dollars have been contributed over the years to educational , welfare , and arts programs and to private institutions that might otherwise have had to draw support from tax funds . Yet year after year the whole concept of the charitable deduction is subjected to attack . There is the argument of the superpopulist who regards any incentive for charitable giving as a nefarious tax " loophole " for the rich . There are the wishful theorists who argue that if all tax deductions and credits could be eliminated  --  the political possibility for which , they admit , is rather remote  --  the tax rates would be reduced and everybody would then give even more to charity . And then there are the experts of the Treasury , whose primary job , of course , is to maximize collections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who want to get virtually everybody to use the so-called short form when they file the annual tax return . That would clearly make Treasury 's job easier , and it would make things simpler for the taxpayer . Since 1970 , year by year , Treasury regulations have been modified and the " standard deduction " has been progressively increased , so that the number of people who itemize their deductions has been reduced from roughly 50 percent of the taxpayers to around 15 percent . A major result , according to some econ-omists and the officials of the national United Way , has been a drastic falling off in private contributions , particularly from taxpayers in the $15,000 to $25,000 annual income brackets . To deal with that problem , bipartisan interest in both the House and the Senate , led by Congressmen Barber Conable ( R.-N.Y. ) and Joseph Fisher ( D.-Va. ) and Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D.-N . Y. ) and Robert Packwood ( R.-Ore. ) , is building toward the enactment of a simple but important change in the tax code that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their bracket and whether they use the " short form " or not . It would simply allow every taxpayer to take a deduction for itemized charitable gifts . This would provide firm and continuing incentives for all taxpayers to give to charity , not just the very affluent who customarily use the long form and itemize everything . In the long run , the survival of various philanthropic endeavors , the continuation and strengthening of the whole system of private initiatives for the public good depends upon maintaining a broadly based participation in charitable giving . As Congressman Continued on page 109 electric beater . Add the peanut butter and oil and mix until pebbly in texture . Add the milk and maple syrup and mix very briefly . Spoon into muffin tins , filling them two-thirds full . Bake 15 minutes . Voluntarism continued from page 56 Conable has said , " We very much need to have a nationwide dialogue on this issue of the survival of private and volunteer efforts to deal with our social needs and problems . We either believe in maintaining a vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on more and more , at greater and greater costs . Everybody talks a great line about the values and virtues of the voluntary Third Sector . We need to find out if we mean it . " That seems like a fair challenge . We do need to talk through these issues as a people . We need to have our leaders in the Congress , in the Executive Branch , and in the so-called Private Sector put their minds on these questions . Out of a searching national examination we ought to try to arrive at some conscious consensus about the most suitable policies concerning private initiatives for the public good . And if we are serious about them , then we need to devise the most suitable policies to improve and strengthen the workings of our privately financed volunteer endeavors . Let me suggest a few interrelated propositions that bear upon that discussion : ? In education , health care , social welfare activities , and the arts we do not and should not have to make either/or choices between government-run and privately administered programs and institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side . The competition , fairly carried on , can stimulate better performance by both , and that will benefit everybody . The government does not have to take over all privately run public services , and we would be a poorer country if it did . The United States has incomparably the best higher education system in the world for meeting the diverse needs of a highly heterogeneous population . The dual private public nature of that system unquestionably has been responsible for much of the rich diversity of our educational programs and has contributed to improvement of teaching and learning through a variety of experimentation . Likewise , in the health and social welfare fields there is much to be gained by having alternative ways of dealing with many of our needs and problems , instead of being locked into some Continued on following page unitary system , whether run by the state or , for instance , by the churches . Untidy as it may be , there are also advantages in having tax moneys for a given social purpose applied in a variety of ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is a pluralistic society ; ours is a confusing age of complex problems . We must resist all pressures to deal with them by a single , simplistic formula . Keeping open our options through private , volunteer initiatives is a significant way of protecting our freedom . ? Volunteer , nongovernmental options make it possible to provide human services on a human scale and in keeping with human values . One of the most serious problems of modern , urbanized , industrialized mass-production society , regardless of system or ideology , is the problem of the vast , cumbersome , expensive , often unresponsive , and , at times , ineffective or tyrannical bureaucracies . When things ( even well-intentioned programs to help people ) get too big , it is often difficult to make them work well and with proper regard for the values by which most human beings want to live . Small is not necessarily beautiful or most efficient . Yet big is often not better , but worse ; not the least costly , but the most expensive . Government by its very nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through large staffs and by means of sweepingly broad rules and regulations . Life in the real world , however , is a story of individual cases and endless exceptions . Small-scale , locally managed , private en-deavors often offer the best ways of dealing with real human beings and their individual problems . ? Private management of many of our social programs and cultural institutions often ( 1 believe  --  usually ) saves money . In particular cases this judgment will be argued ; some private organizations are incompetently and inefficiently managed . Some incur excessive fund-raising costs . ( Nothing , of course , can compete with the federal income tax as a " cost effective " way of getting money out of people . ) But the point about private agencies ' lower costs has widespread validity . And for good reason . They do n't have such high overhead costs , have thinner staffs who generally work for less money . Moreover , private organizations are able to tap the nation 's huge pool of unpaid volunteers much more easily and as a matter of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social services  --  care of the aged , the handicapped , and little children  --  large numbers of volunteers are needed . We are not rich enough , and will never be rich enough , to hire enough government employees , operating under civil service rules , to perform all the human care services we need . In fact , you simply ca n't hire on any dependable basis the kind of loving tender care that many volunteers will provide free . ? Private agencies can experiment and make mistakes more cheaply and learn lessons more promptly than can government agencies in the same field . In the natural sciences the experiments that fail are often just as important as the experiments that succeed . In the social realm , we have a different attitude . Where government programs are concerned it is almost impossible to get anyone involved to admit that a failure has occurred or to abandon a project once undertaken , whatever the evidence of its lack of success . Private initiatives are particularly useful in trying out new ideas , some of which will surely fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even where a program may have to be run and financed by government eventually , there may be great advantage in using a private , limited-commitment experiment as the guinea pig . ? For private , volunteer endeavors to maintain their credibility they must have private financial backing in adequate amounts ; they must genuinely draw upon volunteers . Private organizations and institutions should not allow themselves to be coopted by government , to become primarily dependent on government money , to be dominated by the government rule book . Part of their importance lies in their independence of government , in their ability to differ from the policies and methods of government ; at times , on their ability to criticize government . To maintain that independence they have to have privately contributed resources ; preferably , most , if not all , of their funds should come from individuals , churches , corporations , and foundations . Government policies have and will continue to have a lot to do with whether such private funding is possible . Will private moneys continue to be available to sustain private , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost certainly , Yes . But there is a big if . If the public can be kept aware of the importance of these nonprofit , nongovernmental agencies , and if the government will continue tax policies that encourage charitable giving . Year by year over the past decade , Americans have given enormous sums of money to support private public service and charitable activities , but not nearly as much as was needed and could have been wisely spent . We did not keep up with inflation and the growing needs in human services . Relative to need and rising costs , private charity is in a pinch ; and that pinch could get worse , particularly for private colleges and private hospitals . Yet the money is out there . Last year Americans made private charitable gifts of more than $35 billion . Most of that came from individuals . Almost half of the total went to religious institutions and their programs . Foundations gave a bit more than $2.1 billion , less than 10 percent of the total . Corporations , if you count contributions in kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time off from their regular duties to help nonprofit organizations , gave even more . Foundations are compelled by law to give away all of their investment earnings each year or a fixed 5 percent of their capital assets , whichever is larger . Profit-making corporations are permitted to give away up to 5 percent of their pretax profits and take the appropriate tax deduction . They are not required to give away anything , and about 80 percent of them make no claim to give anything . On the other hand , a small band of concerned corporations are giving away the full allowable 5 percent of profits . Nobody , of course , knows what the potential for giving by the American people and their business concerns may be . It is huge . But our giving will grow to meet the needs only as we understand that those needs represent opportunities for all of us to invest our money and ourselves in the strengthening of our whole society and the preservation of our freedom .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
