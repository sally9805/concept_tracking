txt The British people received quite a shock as this week opened . It was not so much that half the locomotive drivers on London 's commuter services went on strike , or that the roof almost came off the House of Commons as a fierce debate raged upon the state of the economy . It was because the British Treasury firmly announced that the British people  --  truly never have had it . so good . Here they have been feeling rather put out at rapidly rising prices and slowly disintegrating public services , and all the time , the Treasury declares , they have been getting richer and richer and richer . The average personal standard of living here has improved to a greater extent since the beginning of 1972 than at any time in the past 20 years , the Treasury insists . Good news unnoticed Between the second half of 1972 and the spring of 1973 personal income before tax increased by 8.25 percent , it adds . Allowing for tax changes , the rise in prices , the increase in population , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " increased by 3.25 percent , the Treasury avers . This may not sound like much , but it is 60 percent better than the increase in the standard of living , as thus measured , that has been considered normal over the past two decades // *Britain unaware it 's so well off // Why , during the years 1964 to 1970 " real personal disposable income per head " never rose by more than 2 percent in any one year . In 1969 it acutally fell back a little . - The mystery about the Treasury 's good news about last year , however , is why so few people will admit to having noticed it . Negative response To go around asking people , " has your personal standard of living been increasing faster than ever before in the past year or sa ? " - is to invite a negative response , if not some more active reaction . Could it be , one wonders , that because the law of mathematics holds that there must always , be more people with below average incomes than with above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or could it be that the benefits of the advance are not equally shared ? That , for instance , several million persons on company pensions or in low-paid jobs are very much worse off , while several hundred thousands in commerce or the professions are 20 , 30 , or even 40 percent better off ? Complete mystery Or is it just that most people seem to live just a shade above their incomes , so that this year 's pay boost does not improve their standard but merely enables them to pay for last year 's standard ? It remains a complete mystery . Nevertheless it must be true that very many Britons , in spite of everything , are better off this year than last and considerably better off than five years ago .
