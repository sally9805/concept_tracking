After five ballets , three state dinners and a liver-taxing marathon of vodka toasts to Soviet-American friendship , Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans and his aides arrived home last week , hopeful that their mission to Moscow would help open a new millennium of trade between the two superpowers . While Stans was busy gaining five pounds from eleven days of Russian hospitality , Soviet-American commerce was likewise growing heftier . <P> A group of American firms , including United States Steel Corp. , signed contracts to sell $65 million worth of ore-mining and oil-drilling equipment to the Russians in return for $60 million worth of Soviet nonferrous metals . Two weeks earlier , the Commerce Department had approved export licenses for American firms to ship $528 million worth of heavy equipment intended for the Soviet Union 's new Kama River truck factory . Meanwhile , the Nixon Administration announced the sale of $130 million worth of corn and other cattle " feed to the Russians . <P> The trade developments , though not directly related to the Stans visit or to each other , were nonetheless all products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets . The purpose of Stans ' " fact-finding " trip was to find out in general ways what the Soviets want from the U.S. and are prepared to give in return . In an excursion arranged months before Stans ' mis sion last week , 90 U.S. executives were in Moscow conferring with Soviet trade officials and industrial managers . Said William J. Barton , vice president of Business International , the research firm that sponsored the Moscow expedition : " There 's a real thaw-you can almost hear the ice cracking . " <P> Drop in the Samovar . The cracks are still narrow . In 1970 the U.S. sold $118 million worth of goods to the Soviets , mostly hides , pulp , aluminum oxides and machinery . In return , Americans imported $72 million in Russian goods , principally sable skins , fuels , aluminum scrap , chrome ore and other metals . That was a mere drop in the samovar for the Soviet Union , which does about $5 billion worth of business a year with other non-Communist countries . <P> Stans told his Russian hosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $2 billion , a figure that analysts in his own Commerce Department find a bit too heroic . There are about as many obstacles to increased trade as there are to an agreement to limit strategic arms . The Soviets dearly want American high-technology goods , like computers and machine tools . Aside from natural gas and metals , however , they have little of compelling interest to offer American customers . Russian mining officials hope to entice American firms to help them exploit some of the huge Siberian copper deposits . But a joint venture-perhaps modeled after Fiat 's partnership with Russia in the Togliatti auto plant-would require as much as $4 billion in American investment capital .
