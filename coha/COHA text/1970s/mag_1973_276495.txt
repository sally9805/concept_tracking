ONLY a year ago , everything seemed to be going right for Georges Pompidou . Hailed abroad as the paradigm of the " new European man , " respected at home as the faithful trustee of Gaullist order and stability , backed in the National Assembly by a lopsided 274-seat majority , the French President seemed infinitely less vulnerable than his peers in Bonn , certainly , and even London . " If we do n't do anything foolish , " Pompidou 's ministers were saying , " we will stay in power for another 30 years . " <P> All of a sudden , Pompidou 's people have begun to talk about a different time period . Instead of the year 2000 , they now worry about making it past March . Then , some 22 million French voters will go to the polls to choose among 3,000 candidates for the 490 seats in the French Chamber of Deputies . For the first time since Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic in 1958 , there is a real possibility that they will return a leftist majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Gaullist control of the National Assembly but a potentially worrisome constitutional crisis since Pompidou 's seven-year presidential term does not end until 1976 . <P> The unexpectedly strong challenge to the Gaullists comes from a leftwing coalition formed by the Communists and Socialists . Last July , they agreed for the first time in 35 years to campaign on a common platform and then-if they won a parliamentary majority-to govern together . Much to everyone 's surprise , the so-called United Left has lately begun to show up on the long end of the opinion polls . In one nationwide sampling published last month by Le Figaro , the leftists had a 45%-to-38% lead over the Gaullists . With his personal popularity in a sharp decline-he slid from 61% approval in the October polls to 53% last month-Pompidou no longer speaks for France with his customary cool assurance . <P> Nevertheless , the leftist threat to Pompidou is still only theoretical . France does not have proportional representation , and voting districts tend to be laid out in ways that maximize Gaullist strength and minimize the impact of Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the polls next March would probably fail to translate into a majority in the Chamber of Deputies . Even so , the leftist challenge has forced France 's erstwhile man of Europe to become a man on the run . <P> Making Points . The official campaign period begins in mid-February , but Pompidou is already running as if the vote were to be held next week . At a news conference in the Elyse Palace last week , the President played to his conservative constituency . He pointedly declared that he would not meet with four national leaders-Israel 's Golda Meir , Sweden 's Olof Palme , Denmark 's Anker Jrgensen and Austria 's Bruno Kreisky-who were due in Paris to attend an annual meeting of the Socialist International this week . " They are coming here as militants , " Pompidou protested , " not as chiefs of state . " Two days later , he flew off to Byelorussia for a two-day conference with Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev that seemed designed , at least in part , to make points with the French left .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
