 | He Does What He Wants Out There : Mean Jo Greene Like Katharine Hepburn , Charles Edward ( Mean Joe ) Greene refuses to sign autographs . Like Bruce Lee , he kicks people . Like Winston Churchill , he cries . " I never had a desire to hurt anybody , " Greene says . ? I have at certain times had violent urges , but I do n't think I ever have hurt anybody . Tried to a couple times , but I do n't think I have . Yeah , guess I have . In high school . I was dirty then . Kick ' em . I might not 've hurt ' em , though , they might 've just been afraid of me . " I do play football no-holds-barred . Any edge I can get , I 'll take . I 'd grab a face mask only in a fit of anger . Uncontrolled anger is damn near insane . " Greene once shattered three or four of Cleveland Guard Bob DeMarco 's teeth , and they were big teeth way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tried to twist the head off a fellow professional who was holding him . Is it because deep down inside they are so relieved that he is not going to twist their heads off ? is that why people who spend time with him are proud to say that Joe Greene is a nice , warm , thoughtful , sensitive man ? Certainly there are other men who are nice and do n't get the credit for it that Greene does . He 's famous , that 's part of it : he 's the great defensive tackle and volatile cornerstone of the Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers . And he has such bearing . He may be the most nearly rollicking player in the NFL , but his expression , which can be affable , droll , quirky , smoldering , tends to settle into a basic grave . He can look as grave around the eyes as James Mason , but stronger , of course . His head may be as big as James Mason 's chest . Art Rooney Jr . says that Greene is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooney 's huge billy-stick cigars looks normal . No one would take Greene for a sweet/terrifying child of nature , the way they took the late Big Daddy Lipscomb . Greene has this discerning look . When Steeler Quarterback Terry Bradshaw tells a joke to the team , one observer notes , he looks to Greene to see if it has gone over . If it 's a good joke , it probably has . With teammates or friends , though not with fans , Greene is usually comfortable to be around . He does n't dominate a table . But there is that big head . And hands about the size of shovel blades . And there is a molten quality about Greene 's limbs . He is no Apollo ( Zeus , maybe ) . He is jointed oddly , and moves at once more smoothly and more floppily than other strong big men . His physical presence suggests , perhaps , that he could shift ? flick ? any loglike portion of himself in any direction at any moment . His college coach called him " a fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he goes damn near insane . Wearing a loose T shirt and swim suit , Greene sits back in a soft chair in his comfortable home in a suburb south of Dallas , with his 2-year-old daughter Jo Quel drowsing oe his chest . He has an air of profoundly edgy repose , like a mountain that would like to ramble but is not about to slide . He muses , " I 'm always nervous like I got to do something , something other than what I 'm doing . I do n't know what it is . Except playing . When you get into that game . you have n't got time to think about what you ought to be doing . That game , that 's it . I feel I 've got some helluva games in me . I 'm just waiting for ' em to come . That 's s hat i keep pushing for ? waiting . " Lord preserve our sense of reality if whatever consummation Greene awaits comes to him . The ground may opal and he will descend to a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , or a chariot ma ? come down and bear Greene off to a better place where he can make all the tackles and also run back punts . As it : s Greene has led his team to the NFL mountaintop and his had transcendent individual moments on the field . Once he threw the other team 's ball away . Once he spit on Dick Butkus in front of everybody . Once he rushed the quarterback , stole the ball from him , rumbled into the end zone with it , tossed it over his head , caught it behind his back and handed it to a cheerleader . Greene is more than mighty , wily , fierce and twinkle quick . He is a man so daringly self-defined and outrageously responsible that it is said of him , as of very few other sports figures , " He does what he wants to out there . " He plays ? or , sometimes , refuses to play ? the conservator regimented , technology-ridden game of pro football as it a were a combat poem he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits himself well enough into the prevailing system to be the warmly accepted spearhead and bulwark of a w usping organization . There is no ballad of Mean Joe Greene but there was a TV commercial . In this commercial Greene took a seat in a United Airlines plane , shifted his loosely puttogether frame around to test the seat 's comfort , then look coldly , perhaps grimly , into the camera 's eye and said , almost like it . " Greene loves football . He quit it the first time he ? out for it and was still threatening to quit it for good as 1 : : as last season . If his gifts had not been so blatantly e. - traordinary he would never have gone so far in his m : . - taristic profession , for he has never taken to what is ge -- erally considered discipline ; he tended to run amok in hi school ball , and when an older group of Steeler scouts , sin : departed , watched him play for North Texas State , the deplored his attitude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one . " Physically this boy has all of it , " said another " Mentally he is disappointing in that he only uses his a ' ity in spurts . Will need a heavy hand , but he can play Where anybody was going to find a hand heavy enough the scout did not say . The last entry in the Steelers ' scouting file on Greene say " I would question taking a boy like this in the first round as he could turn out to be a big dog . " This note was prophetic only to the extent that it might have conjured up the difficulties involved in trying to block a Doberman pinscher Greene does not even almost like being thought of as an animal , however . " Human , " he said once when asked @#  | what people do n't realize about pro football players . Art Rooney Jr. , the Steelers ' vice-president in charge of scouting , was not put off by the unevenness of Greene 's college play . " He was a third-down player , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down he had to play . He was a guy who just completely dominated guys when he wanted to . " Still there were quibbles over Greene when members of the BLESTO scouting combine got to looking at figures . Someone had measured him at just under 6 ' 3 " , which is short for a tackle . Officially Greene is 6 ' 4 " ( and 270 pounds ) , but maybe he did n't want to be the day this scout took the tape to him . The inch in question was a gnat on which several BLESTO people choked , until one of them , Don Joyce , who had been a chunky standout tackle with the Colts , declared that he was only 6 ' 23A " , and allowed himself to be measured against the conference-room wall to prove it . Thus are geniuses calibrated in our society . In the end Greene was rated among the top prospects in the country , and Coach Chuck Noll , going into his first draft with the Steelers , was especially high on him . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid the first and biggest building block of a six-year program that brought them up from perennial failure . That primacy is one aspect of Greene 's eminence on the team ; another is the assumption among the Steelers that Greene can whip any man , if not indeed any team , when he wants to . Wanting to , though , the way Greene wants to , is not something you can turn off and on routinely . Greene held out for a long time before signing his first Steeler contract , then showed up in camp fat and late . Center Ray Mansfield , now a 10-year veteran , recalls looking forward to teaching the presumptuous rookie some lessons with the help of Guard Bruce Van Dyke , now a Packer . " After a couple of days , " says Mansfield , " we wished we 'd never seen him . " Greene took on the offensive linemen one by one , quickly learned to deal with a couple of moves he had n't seen , and then proved too strong to be overpowered , too elusive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen a player so quick and strong at once . He was something new , like aluminum when it first came out . Nobody wanted to fight him . The coaches wisely kept anything resembling a heavy hand off him . " Play your game , Joe , " they said . Now all he had to do was make his formidability clear to opponents , to let them know " I do n't have to reckon with you . You have to reckon with me . " He also had to work off the frustration , during his first three years with the Steelers , of playing on losing teams . " That 's bound to make you ugly , " he says . Greene 's nickname derives from that of his college team , the Mean Green ( thought up , incidentally , by a lady named Sidney Sue ) , but in the pros Greene has done a number of things to deserve it . In his rookie year he was ejected from two games . Once he threw his helmet so hard at a goalpost that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opposing guard had hit him a good clean block , he seized the offender with one hand on each shoulder pad and kicked him flush between the legs . One day he was glaringly outplaying a good Cincinnati guard named Pat Matson , a 245-pound ball of muscle , until at last Matson developed a bad leg and began limping off the field . Greene ran over and grabbed him before he reached the sideline and tried to coax him back into play , crying , " Come on , I want you out here . " " I 'll never forget the look on Matson 's face , " says Steeler Defensive Captain Andy Russell . There is even a story that once after being thrown out of a game Greene returned to the bench in such a rage that he opened up the equipment manager 's tool chest and pulled out a screwdriver . Whatever he intended doing , he had second thoughts and threw it down . Then there was the time he spit on Butkus . The Bears were humiliating the Steelers . Butkus was blitzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Steeler center just as he snapped the ball , and Greene could n't stand it any longer . The Steeler offense was on the field . Greene had no business out there , but when Butkus passed within 10 feet of the Steeler bench , Greene bolted out at him , yelling challenges , and drew back and spit full in Butkus 's face . " Butkus did n't look intimidated , " says Russell , " but there was Greene obviously wanting to fight him , and fully capable of it , and you could see Butkus thinking , This would n't be the intelligent thing to do . ' " So Butkus turned and walked back into the security of the carnage on the field . When Russell ran into Butkus in the off-season and asked him how he could let a guy spit in his face without retaliating , Butkus said , " I was too busy making All-Pro . " Greene ? who was himself named All-Pro for the fourth time , and NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the second time , last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butkus come off sounding rather prim . " Joe 's first year , " says Russell , " I did n't see how all that emotionalism could be real . It looked like showboating . But I realize now that he 's that way . When I get beat I just think , well , I was out of position , I made a mistake , I 'll do this to correct it . With Joe , it 's in his psyche . It 's like it 's war , and the other side is winning because they 're more violent . And he 's the only guy I know , he can be playing a great game himself but if the team 's losing he gets into a terrible depression . It could be an exhibition game ! " The other thing that gets Greene 's goat , or rather his mountain lion , is being held . He says he realizes that if the rules against offensive holding were strictly enforced , offenses would never get any plays off , either because offensive linemen would keep on holding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit holding and the quarterback would be smothered all day . Greene lives in an age in which defensive lines dominate pro football . But sometimes he feels guards cling too much . He likes to think of his game as one of quickness and finesse , of avoiding blockers , rather than one of violent contact . " It 's that thing in me that I want to be a running back , " he says . " You want to be a running back ? " " Sure . Do n't you ? " When he feels dragged down by contact with blockers , he reacts , even now in his more statesmanlike years . Houston has a young guard named Brian Goodman whom Greene credits with pertinacity ? " I kick the bleep out of him and he keeps on " ? but whom he ca n't stand to oppose because Goodman " does n't know how to play , he just wres-@#  | PI ' ties me . I feel like I 'm worthy of a better person across from me than that . " " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " says Art Rooney Jr . with a shudder , " we sat by the phone waiting for the league office to call up and say they were going to put Joe in jail . He just beat on the poor guy . Goodman 's younger brother came through the draft last winter and we joked about drafting him for Joe . " Greene has a firm sense , then , of how the game ought to be played , and a willingness to take the enforcement of standards into his own hands . One time in Philadelphia during the Steelers ' dark years , they were getting beat , and Greene was being held , and the referees were n't calling it , and finally , before the Eagle center could snap the ball for another play , Greene reached over , grabbed the ball and threw it into the second tier of the stands . Then he stomped off the field . Russell remembers the moment with awe . " Everybody looked at him . He ca n't be doing this , ' we thought . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it took forever . The crowd was dead silent . And the players ? there we were , we did n't have a ball , we did n't have a left tackle . It was like he was saying , ' O.K. , if you wo n't play right , we wo n't play at all . ' Nobody else would do such a thing . In the NFL ! Anybody else would get in trouble with the league , with the coaches , Joe did it . In a moment the crowd exploded . They loved it . " And the Steelers loved Greene . One afternoon when Dwight White , who was living with him in Pittsburgh , was discussing Greene 's sprawling funkiness as a roommate , Greene smiled . " I may be rotten , " he conceded , " but I pull for dudes . " When , during Greene 's second year , the Steelers cut a former North Texas State teammate of his , Greene , in tears , declared he was going to quit . " Joe , " said his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but Greene had to be talked out of an early retirement . When Craig Hanneman , a reserve Steeler defensive end , was traded to New England last year , Hanneman 's coach never said a word to him , but Greene took the time to commiserate and tell him goodby . To reporters , with whom he deals very well , Greene persuasively deprecates his own performances , and praises , quite aptly , the work of the other defensive linemen ? White , L.C. Greenwood , Ernie Holmes ? and Linebackers Russell , Jack Lambert and Jack Ham and Defensive Backs Mel Blount , J.T. Thomas , Mike Wagner and Glen Edwards . Only on such a strong defensive team would Greene get away with taking as many instinctive chances as he does , free-lancing perhaps more than any other player in the league . But the Steeler defense would never have developed its terrific thrust ? a much greater one than that of the Steeler offense ? without Greene . L.C. Greenwood may be the league 's fastest , slipperiest defensive lineman , and he plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the highly mobile White and the terrifying Holmes . But as quick as L.C. is , he ca n't match Greene 's initial burst . The films are likely to show Greenwood taking one step by the time Greene is past the line of scrimmage . " He has the courage of his convictions , " says Russell . @# @# He does n't wait and read , he just does it . " He used to Fn trapped , and that hurt his pride , so now he has more cipline , but he reads on the run . Even if he 's made a stake , he 's penetrated so quickly it may not matter . An .. rises to the occasion . When half the team was out sick hurt against Houston in ' 72 he tore the Oilers apart alm , single-handedly , sacking the quarterback five times , m , of them at key moments . He 's a great hand for recover : fumbles ; last year against Cleveland he picked one up alateraled off to J.T. Thomas for the winning touchdo - You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , Greene feels he gives up a great deal to the system -- Noll insists on his defenders ' meeting blocks instead of do ing them . Greene is usually double-teamed , and he has : fill certain gaps against a possible run before he can go ter the quarterback . He trailed Holmes and Greenwood sacks last year and is more likely to cause the initial drailment of a play than to make the tackle , which is will , - he likes . " The kind of role I play is like an offensive lineman. doing a good job but not being noticed , " he says with son .. : exaggeration . " I feel sorry for myself sometimes . But long as the end result is there , I can dig it . " Greene h : , never.been at odds with coaches or management . His fir : two years he staunchly backed boat-rocking player representative Roy Jefferson ? going so far during the ' 70 play - ers ' strike as to spit in the face of Pittsburgh sportswriter Pat Livingston when Livingston adverted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson over the strike . But after that incident Greene was taker aside by Guard John Brown , now a successful black banker in Pittsburgh , and Bill Nunn , the Steelers ' black frontoffice man . " They made me realize that I was n't as mature as I thought I was , " says Greene , " and that the coach had to run the team . " Jefferson was traded , and Greene , though he was to be an unwavering supporter of the ' 74 strike . turned away from Jeffersonian militance to consolidate hipower on the field . As a matter of fact , a good many Steelers will tell you that Greene now runs the team . No one questions the administrative or strategic authority of Noll , a man so unemotional that when his wife excitedly greeted him after the Super Bowl victory , he held out his hand to be shaken and said , " Well , we did it . " Neither does Noll question Greene 's sense of fitness , which caused him to withdraw himself from a game in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , acing to one account ? last year . In both cases Greene 's put off by what struck him as a lack of fervor among his teammates . " When we 're losing , Joe will get to stalking around out there , " says Russell . " Last year we were beating New Orleans but they were moving the ball and Joe yelled in the huddle , Andy , what 're you going to do ? ' I got mad . I 'm just going to play football , ' I said . " When Henry Davis was middle linebacker and ran the huddle he threatened to come to blows with Greene to shut him up . " Joe 's such a great player , " says Russell , " maybe he thinks everybody else can play better if they try harder . He does n't seem to  | realize that other positions require more restraint , that you can make mistakes if you get too hyper . I do n't think it works to keep making emotional pitches . " In team meetings last year , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to improve . Joe thought we ought to be more honest and bad-mouth the negative . As it turned out he figured his approach worked . " What Greene did last year , before the Steelers suddenly went into high gear , was criticize the Steeler offense to the press , exhort his teammates in general and insult opponents at the line of scrimmage . Some of the Steelers found it all a bit excessive , but many of them were doubtless lifted . They knew at least that Greene was n't posturing . " It was after the playoff game we lost to Miami in ' 72 that I really got to know Joe as a friend , " says Mel Blount . " He and his wife came over to the house and sat around with me and my wife and we talked about it . And a few tears were shed . That 's when I got to know Joe as a true person . A good person . A really concerned person . " On the other hand , Greene is not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer , Receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth and Defensive Back Jim Allen , all second-year men , were sitting together in the 19th Hole , an almost cellar-dark bar to which many Steelers repair after practice . Swann , Stallworth and Allen wanted to make the point that Greene was " no big brother or daddy " to them . " I think he 's a great player , " said Stallworth , " but I think I am , too . " " He 'd stick out like a sore thumb without the rest of the front four , " said Swann . " And he gets so excited on sidelines . He 'll go up to Chuck saying , What 's the quarterback doing ! ' He 'll go up to Lionel Receiver Coach Taylor and say , What 're the receivers doing ! ' He gets so c cited he 's got us playing conservative , while he 's taking chances . " He gets such respect ! Last year somebody clipped land he stomped on the guy 's head . The referee ran up him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' like he 'd say to abody else . Mr. Greene ! l saw it , ' the referee says about clip . He wo n't do it again ! ' " Swann shook his head . " I give him all kinds of trouble , " added Swann about non-big-brother . " I 'll yell at him and he 's so strong he m-kill me . So I got him where he ca n't do anything . " Over at another table , a quorum of the offensive line w drinking Lite beer in big glasses of ice and building a  |p7-amid  out of the cans . That afternoon there had been Oklahoma drill , known on other teams as the Nutcrackerin which an offensive lineman tries to stop a defensive lira . man , one-on-one , from getting to a tackling dummy he by Dan Radakovich , the offensive line coach . Greene Lt. beaten a couple of guys , rested a while , then stepped up : Gordy Gravelle , who had earlier won raves by putting Greenwood on his back ? the first time anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works : against a couple of rushers with success , was psyched c : and sweating . Greene made a move to step in . " You want - to rest ? " Greene asked playfully . Gravelle glared at hir " You too tired ? " asked a coach , more seriously . " For him ? " Gravelle snapped with what seemed like re. , feeling . Greene came on ; Gravelle , straining , held him en , . held him out , held him out . Greene let up , as though be. : ? - en . Then , in a lightsome way that seemed out of keeping - with the grunting and groaning that had gone on before . spun around a relaxed Gravelle and , too late to sour tagged Radakovich 's actual person . Except in terms of who could be more whimsical. seemed that Gravelle had won . " Gordy handled Joe pre : well , huh ? " the interviewer asked the offensive linemen at the table . The offensive 1i-. blinked . " Because Joe did n't try , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Guard Gerry Mullins , who is white and was Greene -- roommate on the road last year . " His hand is so big ? the heel of it hits the front of your - shoulder pad and you think he 's pushing . - back , then his fingertips grab under the back . of your pad and he pulls you forward . " The offensive-line table reflected upsGreene as a gathering of mariners might refleet upon the sea . The Steeler offensive line was effective last year in large part because felt so relieved , in games , to be block in against defensive lines other than the Steelers ' . " Is n't that infuriating , " asked the interviewer , " to ha-. a guy beat you at his pleasure ? " " Infuriating ? " said Mansfield , who won an NFL Bloc -- er of the Year award last year and says there is nobody he ca n't handle one-on-one except Greene . " When Joe Greer : Tr H : I c 102  | stomps you it 's not infuriating . It 's more like frightening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Did you ever see a dog get hold of a snake ? " Then Greene entered . He sat at a table by himself . He was wearing a sort of misshapen big-brimmed golf hat and in the darkness it was hard to make out much of him except eyes and teeth , both of which flashed fitfully . For some reason he began to talk about getting beat . " A black man ? I say a black man , we got no corner on the market , but every day in some form or fashion you got to prove you 're a man , " he said . " But you want to keep the lifeand-death situations down . I can get beat . But there 's getting beat and there 's getting stomped . When I start getting stomped , then I get . . . . " Here he acted out , in subdued and semi-humorous form , his reaction to getting stomped . It was sort of a wild-eyed , spread-armed hopping around in his chair which , if extrapolated slightly , would probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in anything but a stomped mood . He looked fondly at the other Steelers . " These guys , " he said of the offensive linemen . " We gave them hell . Called them sissies . Called them girls . But they did a job . " Looking in the guys ' faces , " he said , " I see the happiness , I see the peace of mind , I see what winning that Super Bowl means for the first time . " The whole . That 's what 's important . The whole . " He glowed in the dark . He threw his empty beer can . Whango ! It exploded the offensive line 's carefully constructed threefoot-high pyramid of cans . Cans bounded all over the floor and the offensive line . " Time to go to supper anyway , " said Greene . No one took offense . Greene was born 28 years ago in Temple , Texas . He looks older ? not aged , but just not boyish at all . He was always big for his age , and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was actually six years older than his official age , as if he had been found unknown in the fields somewhere and passed off by his high school as an adolescent . Art Rooney Jr . checked the records and found the rumor to be untrue . Greene was raised by his mother , who lives with him and who always called him Joe , which is a good thing because Mean Charles Greene sounds silly . He grew up without a father . What if he 'd had one around ? " Maybe it would 've made me stronger in some ways in which I 'm weak , " he says . " Given me some stability . I often wonder . But I always knew my mother loved me . No matter how hard it was , she always took care of us . I chopped cotton some , picked cotton , but all the kids did that . When I was 12 I told myself I 'd never go back in the fields . I had a burning desire to be a success at something . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to get away too far from hustling money for a pair of shoes , and being into every day black situations .

I feel anxieties , pressures , feel that people are going to ask me for an autograph even when they do n't . Sometimes I feel good about giving autographs , when people are really nice and it means something to them . But people come up to you when you 're out to dinner . How much you make ? ' Out of the clear blue ! What you doing out this late ? " When they gon na put you to work ? ' What you mean they ' ? If I 'm gon na work , I ' ' m gon na put myself to it .

But they 're strangers . Then they say something like , " W000 , you 're big , " and Greene wants to say , " Yeah I 'm big , runt . " He says , " It 's not that the comments are so bad , it 's that I hear them so many times . It 's hard for me to hide my emotions . I come off as being mean , ugly . Sometimes I get the feeling I am that way . I do n't like what all that makes me become . " But now he is thinking back to what he was . " I never got into trouble when I was a kid , but it 's strange , I got the reputation of being a bully . I did n't deserve it . Before I started playing football , I was getting my butt kicked constantly . It was always some old , little guy . At one point I was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy . I still am a bit . Then I started playing football and I guess that all kinda went away . I started taking my aggressions out on other people . " But all through high school , guys would tease me . As late as my senior year some nut drew a picture of me on the board . A picture of some kind of beast . I guess they did n't know it hurt my feelings . All of a sudden one day I 'd say Hey ' and pop them on the side of the head . " That 's how I got in the habit of being a nice guy . Which ? I ai n't no nice guy . I think I have respect for other people . But I 'm subject to do some wild things any minute . " Greene 's wife Agnes stays in the Texas house while Joe is in Pittsburgh half the year .

Because I did n't have anything to say . You ca n't be descriptive about nothing . " Greene has prospered . With a friend , he has started a janitorial company . He 's appeared in a few quickie films ? in one of which , The Bad Black Six , he picked white motorcycle hoods up over his head and threw them . He seems a bit defensive about his movie career , though he shows up well enough on the screen . This summer he turned down a chance to star in a movie as a washed-up ballplayer . Like most ballplayers he has no taste for the rough give-andtake of business . " Business is dirty . All of it I 've been into ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People are always going under the table trying to outflank you . I try to be straightforward and right . " He has trusted several who he feels cheated him . " When you make a lot of money fast , that 's when the buzzards are thickest , " he says . He is suffering currently over his estrangement from several college friends who had gone on to play pro ball . He had been involved with them in a firm that planned to represent other players and invest in real estate . Greene withdrew from the group . " They thought I deserted them . But we just did n't have the vehicle . We 'd have wound up ripping people off , too . I 'm not gon na let the snake bite me if I know it 's there . " Greene is settling down . " I 'm more into practice , and working out , " he says . " I did n't used to have the patience for those things . This off-season 1 did something every day , or every other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball . " Steeler Strength Coach Lou Riecke brought him a set of weights in February . " I used to just lift when Lou Ina @# or Chuck was looking . When they turned their heads I 'd stop . But then some of the guys I used to throw around a little bit , I could n't anymore . I 'd have to spend too much energy doing it . I 'm basically lazy . " This season Greene looks different . His upper body is more conventionally muscular , his distinctive spare tire is gone . He has a championship to defend . Does all this mean he will be even better ? " When I dream at night , " he says , " I visualize techniques . Some of ' em are just ungodly . It 's just cat quickness : run over a guy , hurdle him , jump six feet , put three or four moves on him so he freezes . No flaws in those moves . Perfect push and pull on the guard , jump over the center . Another blocker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws it , catch it and run 99 yards . ' Cause I do n't want it to be over quick ! The only thing that ever matched the dreams I had was the Super Bowl . " Greene and Art Rooney seemed to enjoy the Super Bow1 more than anybody . Rooney , the Chief , was in camp one afternoon this summer , standing beside the practice field . A kid asked him for his autograph . " I 'm not one of the players , " said the Chief , who is 74 . The kid said that was all right . ; ' Where do you come from ? " asked the Chief . The kid named a town . The Chief asked , " You know Doctor Weaver there ? He had a sign in his office : I 'M NOT A DOCTOR . WHAT I HAVE IS A GIFT FROM GOD . But he could do more for your muscles than anybody . " The Chief went on about others of his wide range of friends , Tip O'Neill , Sargent Shriver , Mean Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way last year before the playoff game with Oakland when Joe came up to me . He grabbed my hand and said , We 're gon na get ' em . ' That was an emotional moment . I never had a moment like that . " Greene comes over and greets the Chief . They chat for a moment and then Greene moves away , saying , " Enjoy yourself now . " It seems an odd thing , but a friendly thing , to say to one 's owner . " That Joe Greene , " says the Chief . " He takes you . I 've never seen a player lift a team like he does . I just hope he plays out his full years . He 's the type of player who would n't want to be associated with a team that did n't play all-out . " There was a time when the Chief voiced doubts about Joe Greene . That was when the Steelers had drafted him No. 1 and he was holding out . " Who is he anyway ? " the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . " A few years later , Art Jr . would gesture at the photographs of old Steeler greats ? Ernie Stautner , Whizzer White , Bullet Bill Dudley ? covering the walls of his father 's office and say , " Someday you 'll have to take all these down and throw them away and put up one of Joe Greene . " But he did n't say that when the Chief questioned how good Greene might be . " Joe Greene is as good , " is what Art Jr . told his father , " as you can imagine . " And if things stay close enough to being as good as Greene can imagine , pro football may be able to hold on to himoops , that 's the wrong term ? may be able to keep him around a while longer . Meanwhile Mean Joe is nervous , and waiting , and doing , one way or another , what he wants to out there .                   @ @
