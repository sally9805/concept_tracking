PLAGUES AND PEOPLES <P> by WILLIAM H.McNEILL <P> 369 pages . Anchor Press/Doubleday. $10 . <P> <P> Empires rise and fall . Tribes , nations , peoples flourish and vanish . Customs and cultures evolve . Why ? Is it God 's will ? Sheer chance ? The power of greed ? The pattern of history ? All of the above is probably the safest answer . But even taking that much into account , argues University of Chicago Professor William McNeill , historians miss one of the prime catalysts in human history : infectious disease . <P> Caste System . In Plagues and Peoples McNeill , who won the 1964 National Book Award for The Rise of the West , offers a provocative medical man 's view of why the world took some of the turns it did . Most writers figure that Rome succumbed to outer Goths and inner decadence . McNeill maintains that a series of epidemics-measles , smallpox , plague-so depleted the empire 's population that by the middle of the 3rd century A.D. it was no longer able to resist the barbarians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots of India 's caste system , according to McNeill ; its rigid rules developed as the country 's Aryan invaders sought to protect themselves from the diseases carried by the people whose lands they had overrun . <P> Even the colonization of the New World may owe as much to epidemic disease as to gunpowder and the quest for gold . The Aztecs , McNeill notes , were on the verge of ousting Cortes from Mexico when an outbreak of smallpox blunted their assault . The disease spared the Spanish , who had already developed some immunity , but so devastated the Indians that even 50 years later the population of central Mexico was only one-tenth what it had been before Cortes landed . <P> Humanity 's experience with illness began millenniums ago when microparasites-bacteria and viruses-evolved into the same ecological niche as man . Disease organisms presented few problems as long as humans were few and their communities small ; pathogenic , or disease-causing , microbes can flourish only in a large human reservoir . But population growth and the development of cities provided a perfect breeding ground for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptians , stalked the streets of ancient China . <P> Microbes , like people , are always in a process of evolution . They have also proved marvelously mobile . They have marched with every army ever fielded , and claimed more victims than bronze spears , muskets or machine guns . From 1803 to 1815 , Napoleon lost more of his men to typhus than he did to bullets or bayonets . During the Crimean War in 1854-56 , disease killed ten times as many British soldiers as did Russian cannons . Even at the turn of our present century , British combat deaths during the Boer War were only a fifth as high as losses due to disease . Indeed , it was not until the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 , when the Japanese introduced inoculation , that military casualties from disease began to fall below those from enemy action .
