In most auto races , the competing cars have about as much in common with the family flivver as an Apollo spacecraft has with a Piper Cub . Not in the Trans-American Championship for sports sedans . Commonly known as the Trans-Am , the competition is limited to genuine stock cars ; the rules restrict engine size to 305 cu . in. and require that at least 2,500 identical models be in general distribution . The result is what Tracy Bird , executive director of the sponsoring Sports Car Club of America , calls " product identity , " a sense of involvement that has drawn more than 650,000 enthusiasts to the Trans-Am since it was started four years ago . " Every guy who owlis a Mustang , " explains Bird , " loves to hear that one won . It vindicates his choice . And the Camaro owner can hardly wait until the next race when Mustang gets clobbered . " <P> Detroit 's automakers are only too well aware of the sales potential . Before a race , local dealers stage long parades of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesmen dressed in the colors of the racing cars are everywhere passing out brochures . Nothing , though , sells like a winner . As one San Francisco Ford dealer puts it : " What a wedge to close a deal ! When a salesman gets a performance-oriented buyer-and you 'd be surprised how many there are-whammo ! " <P> No Gimmicks . Determined to gain a larger share of the muscle-car market , Chrysler entered its brand-new Dodge Challenger in the Trans-Am for the first time this year , along with a redesigned Plymouth Barracuda . American Motors convinced Mark Donohue and Roger Penske , Trans-Am champions for the past two years in Chevrolet Camaros , to switch to its Javelins in a deal that will earn the pair a reported $3,000,000 over the next three years . General Motors countered by appointing Jim Hall , designer and driver of the innovative Chaparrals to head its Camaro team , while Veteran Driver Jerry Titus is pushing a second G.M. hopeful : a radically modified Pontiac Firebird . For its part , Ford has put Drivers George Follmer and Parnelli Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficent backing by the manufacturers is ( iot the only reason that the Trans-Am attracts the U.S. 's best drivers . " We race at Indianapolis and other road races , " explains Penske , " but the Trans-Am is the series we love the best . Everyone has the same type and size V-8 engine . We all weigh the same . No gimmicks , just good hard racing with near-equal cars . " <P> Little Solace . In the first of the 13 races in the 1970 Trans-Am circuit , six different makes of cars were among the top seven finishers . Mustang roared off to an early lead by copping the first four races , then lost out to Donohue 's red , white and blue Javelin . That set the stage for race No. 6 last week at the aptly named Donnybrooke Speedway in Brainerd , Minn . In the hardest fought contest so far this season , Follmer 's Mustang and Milt Minter 's Camaro waged a torrid battle for the lead . Growling into the final turn , Follmer tried to charge past Minter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement , spun in a complete circle and then finished 15 seconds behind Minter . Afterward , Follmer bulled his way into the winner 's circle and took a couple of wild swings at Minter before he was restrained by police .
