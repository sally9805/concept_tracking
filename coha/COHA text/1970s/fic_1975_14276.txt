SCENE : Bare stage . Center on slightly raised platform , MAZON sits in electric chair facing audience . Hands , arms , legs , feet , chest , neck bound with bands of steel to the silver chair . He is barefoot , blindfolded , wears T-shirt and jeans , yellow spot on chair , rest of stage black . Lights rise slow on MAZON ( speaks in clipped , southwestern rodeo accent . ) MAZON Oh yeah , today 's the day I buy the pick-up . I 've decided . Six cylinder , three-quarter ton bed , heavy-duty rear springs , three speed column . Should pull the horses all right . ' Course with the three fifty V-8 you 'd get more power . Do n't really need it though . Wo n't be goin ' off the road much . Just up to Santa Rosa and back . Maybe sixty miles round trip . Just to take that mare up and get her bred . Jesus ! You should see that stud , boy ! Does the quarter mile in twenty-one seconds dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said they never seen an Appaloosa like him . Should throw a blanket foal , that 's for sure . Got a leopard on both sides of the pedigree . Could make a cuttin ' horse too , what with that mare . She 's almost one-third Quarter Horse herself . She can move , boy . I 've seen her doubled in half over a cow . Anyway , that six cylinder should do it . Save us some on gas . Do n't plan on doin ' much rodeo . That old Tommy Ferguson 's got it wrapped up . Might try some halter shows up North . We got those yearling fillies we could show . They got class , boy . That 's the ticket , see . You take those Quarter mares and you breed right back to Thoroughbreds , racing stock , and you got yourself an all-purpose type horse . You got refinement when you out-cross like that . You take Three Bars . If it were n't for that damn stud horse the whole Quarter Horse breed would look like Angus steers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what he brought to the breed . Look at the heads he threw . Anyway , the Appaloosa is n't hurtin from Thoroughbred blood neither . What 's that Indian Hemp stud they got now ? Forget his name . Good blood . And that Sheljet horse outa ' Colorado . Shit man , you never seen a pedigree like that . Jet Deck on the top side . Lady Bug Moon on the bottom . Bright red sorrel horse . Sure to throw colored foals . You take any Appaloosa mare to him and I guarantee you 'd get a colored foal . Speed too . He 's a flyin ' machine . ' Course they all got speed outa ' Colorado . It 's that mountain air . Must be . Grass ai n't bad either . Out here they got that all-purpose pasture . Ai n't worth a damn . Too much blue alfalfa . Blows ' em up . Blow a horse inside out with that stuff . Gets inside there and ferments . I 've seen it . Swells ' em up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rocky Mountain . No wonder they got so many triple-A horses comin ' outa ' there . Out here they feed pellets and then wonder how come a horse do n't put the flesh on . Ca n't beef a racin ' horse up like that . Needs grain and good pasture . I 'd send the whole string out there for the summer if I could afford it . I would . ' Course out here you got the money . You got the mares too . Never seen such mares . You take that T-Dok mare . I was ridin ' her flat out the other day and I swear to God she was n't even blowin ' at the finish . Musta ' done six furlongs at full tilt , and she had everything left . Took all I had to haul her in . We had that gelding out there with her and she left him standin ' . Had six lengths on him . He 's a tough horse too . Barrel racer . ' Course the shoer said he 's got a slight touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though if we keep him workin ' . I noticed he was a little turned in on his front feet but I took him to be over-muscled . Shoer says he can compensate by filing down the outside horn . You know , that gelding was out to pasture for four months straight , never had a soul on his back , and I took him straight in and cut five calves with him . Right off the dime like that . Five calves . That 's what I call cow sense . Too bad he ai n't registered . We could make some money off that pony . Put him in the Snaffle Bit Futurity and clean up . I put a snaffle on him the other day and it made all the difference . That curb was puttin ' too much pressure on his jaw . You could tell the way he was tossin ' his head all the time . Skeeter told me to try a martingale on him but I could tell that was n't it . It was that damn bit . Too much pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned as soft as butter . Just neck reinin ' to beat all hell . Dandy horse . He stops suddenly and just sits silently , no movement , lasting for one full minute , then he begins again . p. 3 MAZON Dude says he can give me a deal on that blue truck . Almost four hundred off the list price . Smells good inside that thing . Sweet . Steers like a damn car . Got that big eight-foot bed . No extras . Got those skinny bicycle tires on it . Comes stock like that . Put some big mags on there and she 'll be tough . Should pull that two horse trailer . Furthest I 'd take it is down to L.A. Highway Five all the way . Right down through the center . Over the Grapevine . Bakersfield . Should pull that okay . That V-8 would do it better but I ca n't afford the gas . Damn thing only gets about twelve to the gallon . Ai n't worth it in the long run . Only be makin ' that long haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Couple a ' auctions maybe . It 's a full eight hours no matter how ya ' cut it . Specially with a double rig . Full day 's ride . He stops suddenly again and sits silently . The lights begin to dim very slowly and take a full minute to come to black . Just as the lights reach black the chair ignites with an electric charge that lights up MAZON 'S entire body . He makes no sound . The electric charge is very short , just long enough to take in the illuminated body then back to black .
