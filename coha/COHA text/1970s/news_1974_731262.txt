txt Since he learned he has terminal cancer , 43-year-old Orville Kelly bas been having the time of his life .. All three major television networks have filmed him , , more than a dozen local radio stations have interviewed him , he has lecture dates scheduled across America , and a publishing house is interested in a book on his life . The cause of Kelly 's overnight success is so simple , he says he still ca n't understand it : He tells people be has learned to face death . without fear and that others can and should , too . THAT HUNDREDS have written Kelly for advice makes him believe Americans badly need to change their basic attitude toward death . Bringing about that change has become his life work , a project begun with formation oi Make Today Count , a group consisting of : : ally and others in Burlington who are terminally ill . Kelly 's national fame started in January when the local newspaper , The Hawk Eye , Orville Kelly , his wife , Wanda , and their four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his attitude toward death . In that essay , Kelly described how he became withdrawn and morose last spring after learning he had incurable cancer spreading thru his lymph system . Last summer , Kelly wrote , he lost interest in everything . His wife developed a nervous disorder , his four children were bewildered , friends and relatives shunned his company . " I could n't even yell at the kids when they got out of line , " he recalls . " All I could do was sit and stare and wonder why God was doing this to me . " WHILE DRIVING home from the hospital on a beautiful autumn day , Kelly suddenly realized his fear was robbing him of the enjoyment of his last days . He told his wife Wanda that they would talk to their older children about his cancer when they got home , and then they would barbecue some ribs on the back porch . ' The decision " to stop thinking about dying and start thinking about life , " as Kelly puts it , did not involve doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money , we might have thought about travel or something , " he says . " But with four kids and no money , you ca n't make plans like that . " For a man whose chief income is Social Security disability checks , Kelly does spend money a little more freely than most . He llices to stop by salobns a few blocks from his turn-of-thecentury brick home to buy drinks for a friend or two . THE OTHER day he bought a new portable color television set on credit . " That 's something I 've never done before , " he says . " But it 's not so much and the kids will get a lot out of it . " Kelly says he and Wanda only wanted to ! return their family to a normal routine , to enjoy simple things like walking in the woods or visiting with friends . But the essay on death , picked up by national wire services , changed his plans for a simple life . Letters praising his courage , asking advice and offering lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a sorting center for hundreds of letters , dozens of calls . BY HIS OWN account , Kelly turned his terminal illness into a career , the most successful career of his life . He spent a dozen years in the Army after graduation from high school in 1948 , then drifted from office work to writing for weekly newspapers around Illinois . Pneumonia and other health problems prevented him from working full time since 1971 , Kelly says , and perhaps this simple background accounts for his success . " Maybe when ordinary people see me , " Kelly says , " they see an ordinary guy who has made ordinary mistakes in his life , who has never really done very much one way or the other , and they see if I can do it face death , then maybe they can do the same thing . " A large , fleshy man , Kelly finds formal situations tiring and likes to limit lectures to an hour . ( " One reason it took me so long to get checked for cancer was I thought my health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . WHEN GIVING a lecture , Kelly quickly doffs his coat , pulls off his clip-on tie , and talks in rumpled shirt sleeves . His lectures are as simple as his life style . Talking to a roomful of nurses in a Mount Pleasant , Ia. , hospital , he reminded them that death comes to everyone , that " we are all terminal . " He then told of an old schoolmate who expressed sympathy at Kelly 's illness . " Last week I read in the paper my friend died after a heart attack , " Kelly told the hospital audience . A few people chuckled at the irony , then gasped when they realized they were laughing at death . FOR KELLY and others In Make Today Count , laughter is vital , altho they avoid a preoccupation with death or disease at their meetings . At the group 's first informal meeting a few months ago , 18 terminally ill persons an d their families from this hilly Mississippi River town of 32,000 gathered . At the third meeting a few weeks ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? clergymen , nurses , and others especially interested in terminal illness . " We drink coffee and laugh a lot , " Kelly says . " We may talk about each other 's illness , but we might talk about going Hunting , too . The idea is just to be normal . " Clyde Klossing , Kelly 's fatherin-law , agrees . When Kelly himself was depressed with his cancer , Klossing says he was uneasy being around him . " WE 'RE A LOT more cheerful now , " Klossing says . " I feel more at ease . I told him I 'd do all I could to raise those kids when he 's gone . We feel so much at ease , we kinda laugh about it now , just like a part of the conversation . We do n't make fun of it , but we 're all at ease with it . " Klossing , who once avoided saying . the word , now sometimes introduces Kelly as " my son-in-law , the one with cancer who 's been on TV . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callers asking to talk to " the cancer man . " People should n't be afraid of words like " cancer " and " death , " Kelly says . " When I called a funeral director about arrangements for my funeral , " Kelly tells an audience , " he said he assumed I wanted to talk about what they 'd do when I was laid to rest . I told him , no , I was already resting , and I wanted to talk about what would happen when I died . " KELLY DOES N'T know , of course , when he will die . It could be in a few months or even years . He takes massive doses of toxic drugs as chemotherapy to fight the onslaught of his cancer . That treatment reduces Kelly 's natural immunity to disease , complicating other health problems . He is not hesitant to say that he believes in God , but declines to discuss his religious beliefs . He says acceptance of death should n't be tied to a particular doctrine or be heavily dependent upon a belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows . he 's terminally ill , Kelly retains hope of a breakthru to extend his life , a hope he believes is common and healthy for the terminally ill . Kelly continues making plans for the future with little regard to his health . He and his wife plan a trip to the Virgin Islands this spring , a trip won on one of the network television shot 's . " IT 'LL BE our first real honeymoon in 15 years , " Mrs.1 Kelly says . Kelly hopes discussions with a book publisher will bring a contract that will provide some money for his family after he dies . He also hopes that Make Today Count groups will spread across America .
