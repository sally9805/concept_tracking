txtp100tled steak sauces of today , such as President Ford poured on his cottage cheese , were originally based on such formulas ; they are now so hyped up with bad vinegar and chemical preservatives that they ruin the taste of anything they are put to . Miss Leslie 's bread was still an honest loaf , made only of flour , salt , water , and yeast ( either from the brewery or homemade ) . But the cake and quick-bread sections are beginning to look very American : our sweet tooth is becoming more evident and the use of chemical leaveners is increasing . The recipe for Washington Cake cautions , " Take care not to put in too much pearl-ash , lest it give the cake an unpleasant taste . " Usually , Miss Leslie 's good judgment prevailed . Here , she gives the classic recipe for a Sally Lunn : Sift into a pan a pound and a half of flour . Make a hole in the middle , and put in two ounces of butter warmed in a pint of milk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table-spoonfuls of the best fresh yeast . Mix the flour well into the other ingredients , and put the whole into a square tin pan that has been greased with butter . Cover it , set it in a warm place , and when it is quite light , bake it in a moderate oven . Send it to table hot , and eat it with butter . Miss Leslie 's New Cookery Book , published in 1857 , gives the same recipe but , as noted in an earlier chapter , finds it necessary to warn that sugar or spice would spoil the cake . Americans were beginning to hoax things up with sugar . An earlier Leslie edition gives an exceptionally fine recipe for Boston Cream Cakes . It calls for a batch of individual cakes , made with 1/2 pound butter and 8 eggs , filled with a custard made with 12 egg yolks , flavored with " a vanilla bean and a stick of the best Ceylon cinnamon , " and a glass of rose water . Perfectly typical of today 's updated recipes for thisp101old American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Evan Jones . It is a banal two-egg cake spread with a filling that has been thickened with onethirdcup flour and two miserly eggs . Sic transit gloria . James Beard gives a one-egg version of the cake , and asserts , " Old recipes invariably called for sour milk or buttermilk and soda . " ( Emphasis ours . ) Not Miss Leslie 's old recipe . The point is not just that Miss Leslie 's recipe is richer ? although since sweets can hardly be defended on any ground but sheer gourmandise , they ought to be of the finest quality , or shunned . It is a question of the contrast of textures ; the slightly dense , golden-crusted madeleine type cakes full of buttery goodness have a surprise filling of a beautifully flavored , rose scented , silken custard , uncheapenedby flour . The comparison of Miss Leslie 's cakes with the miserly modern version is a perfect illustration of the decline in taste and cooking skills of the past one hundred and fifty years . Mrs. Jones , who , incidentally , is editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a recipe in Evan Jones ' book that she calls " Miss Leslie 's Indian Pound Cake . " The ingredients : 6 tablespoons butter , 1 cup sugar , 4 eggs , I1 cups flour , 3/a teaspoon baking powder , 1/4 cup white cornmeal , Y8 teaspoon grated nutmeg , 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon , 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract , and 2 teaspoons applejack . Shall we turn to Miss Leslie ? Her ingredients for her Indian Pound Cake : 1/2 pound fresh butter , 1/2 pound sugar , 8 eggs " beaten as light as possible , " 1/2 pint wheat flour , 1 pint fine yellow Indian meal , I nutmeg , 1 tablespooncinnamon , a glass of white wine , and a glass of brandy . ( This recipe appears in Directions for Cookery . Miss Leslie 's Seventy-five Receipts , 1832 edition , gives a virtually identical recipe . ) That Mrs. Jones roughly halved the recipe is understandable . But why did she reverse the proportion ( andp1O2then some ) of wheat flour to cornmeal ? Why did she specify white meal instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm about that . ) Why did she add baking powder , which did not yet exist ? Why did she change the method ? Why did she use two teaspoons of applejack instead of generous amounts of white wine and brandy ? Why in short , did she call it " Miss Leslie 's Indian Pound Cake " ? Occasionally an old recipe may benefit from modernization , but surely the reader should be so informed . It is sad to be obliged to point out flaws in what is in many ways an admirable book . Mr. Jones writes with love and enthusiasmabout the regional cuisines of America , but there is no bibliography and one is left feeling unsure of his sources . Although Directions for Cookery was first published in Philadelphia , the Pennsylvania Dutch influence is barely discernible . Scrapple and shoofly pie do not show up , but Miss Leslie does say of cottage cheese , " This is that preparation of milk vulgarly known as Smear Case spreading cheese . " There is a Moravian Sugar Cake and a fine recipe for Pepper Pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purists insist upon . There is also what may be the earliest printed version of what came to be pure Americana , cole slaw . ( Amelia Simmons mentions slaw , made with red cabbage , but gives no recipe . ) Miss Leslie calls it Cold Slaw , a typical linguistic substitution of a word of similar sound for another that is not understood . Cole is the old English word for cabbage ( kohl in German ) , still surviving in words like cauliflower and kohlrabi . ( From Latin caulis and Greek kaulos . Cabbage , by the way , comes from French caboche , meaning head , and the word still survives in certain patois . ) Slaw is a simple corruption of salad . It may have come through either German or English . Miss Leslie recommended an old-fashioned boiled dressing , the likes of which was to continue as the dressing for cole slawp103and potato salad well into the twentieth century ? when it was displaced by commercial mayonnaise . In the same year of 1837 when Miss Leslie 's classic appeared , Sylvester Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , flour with most of the nutrients removed . The message evidently spread . By 1845 , Graham flour appeared in The Improved Housewife , " by a MarriedLady " ( Mrs. A. L. Webster ) , published in Hartford , Connecticut . It is sad to note that one of our earliest " health " - bread recipes is also one of the earliest to call for sweetening ? a pattern that has only intensified since . It is also ironic , because it was precisely the impoverishmentof ordinary flour that inspired the addition of sugar . Mrs. Webster 's book also has news for Beard , who says in his American Cookery that before the late nineteenth century , cream pies were not pies at all but " really simple cakes , made in two or three layers with a cream or custard filling . " Well , Mrs. Webster 's cream pie is a sure enough pie , with a filling made of five eggs , a pint of " sweet thick cream , " sugar , seeded raisins , nutmeg , and a bit of salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , two eggs , and milk or light cream ? " for a rich flavor , use part milk and part evaporated milk " ? and he suggests topping it with " gelatinized whipped cream . " Mrs. Webster 's Connecticut Thanksgiving Chicken Pie is worth a look : In sufficient water to prevent burning , stew old or young fowls , jointed , all but tender enough for the table . Pour all into a dish , and season with salt and pepper to the taste . When about cold , place the parts in your pudding dish , lined with a thin common paste , adding about half a pound of butter to three pounds of fowl , in alternate layers . Take more of the paste ; roll it nine times , studding it each time with butter ( it must be very rich ; ) be careful to roll out , each time , from you , and to roll up towards you , leav/ing it , at least , an inch thick . Add the upper crust ; cut a lip in it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly sprinkled the chickens with flour , after almost filling the dish with the liquor in which the chickens were stewed . Pin tight around the rim of the dish a cloth bandage , to prevent the escape of the juices ; and bake from an hour to an hour and a half , in a quick oven . If the top burns , lay a paper over it . One more interesting development was taking place . Most cookbook writers up to and including Miss Leslie measured dry ingredients by weight rather than volume , in baking . Mrs. Webster now announces , " For most preparations , it is easier to measure than to weigh . " But it is not as accurate , dear lady . Flours and for that matter many other ingredients vary enormously in bulk . As if to emphasize the danger , Mrs. Webster 's table of measures contains a blooper that may have caused many a tear : " Butter , when soft ? one pound is one quart . " It is , of course , one pint , and anybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a ninny . Mrs. Webster was , at best , what one would describe as a good plain cook and yet she , too , reflects some of the superior virtues of her time . On making coffee , for instance , she states firmly , " Old Java and Mocha are the best kinds . " It should be roasted " till the color of chestnuts ... the day it is to be used .... Do not let it boil ; the perfume will be lost by evaporation . Do not make the coffee in a tin vessel . Make it in China , delft-ware , or in silver . " Compare her directions with those in any gourmet cookbook today .... We have remarked earlier the sensual and knowledgeableapproach to flour and bread and beans in Mary Cornelius 's The Young Housekeeper 's Friend ( 1845 ) . The book is interesting on other counts as well . Her Directions Respecting Fish are to the point : " Purchase those which have just been caught . Of this you can judge by their being hard under the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a few hours make a wide difference in the taste of some sorts . " ( Our emphasis . ) In the 1871 edition Mrs. Cornelius gives this fine recipe for Marblehead Chowder : Fry three or four slices of salt pork , soak a dozen hard crackers , cut up four or five onions . When the pork is fried brown take it out , and lay in half of the crackers , and half the onions . Cut up the cod , and lay the pieces next , then the rest of the crackers and onions , season it with pepper and salt , pour boiling water enough into the kettle to cover the whole . Let it stew moderately an hour . The fish should be fresh from the water . Cod 's heads and sound bones make the richest chowder . Another chowder of hers , which also appears in the earlier edition , ends thus : " Some people add a cup of milk just before it is served . " This is the first mention we have come across of a milk chowder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look backward for a moment . Mrs. Randolph , in The Virginia Housewife , published a recipe for " Chowder , a sea dish " : Take any kind of firm fish , cut it in pieces six inches long , sprinkle salt and pepper over each piece , cover the bottom of a small Dutch oven with slices of salt pork about half boiled , lay in the fish , strewing a little chopped onion between ; cover with crackers that have been soaked soft in milk , pour over it two gills I cup of white wine , and two of water ; put on the top of the oven , and stew it gently about an hour ; take it out carefully , and lay it in a deep dish ; thicken the gravy with a little flour and a spoonful of butter kneaded together , add some chopped parsley , boil it a few minutes , and pour it over the fish ? serve it up hot . At first glance , the white wine and beurre manie might suggest a derivation from the French chaudree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word chowder alsop106derives from chaudron , or cauldron . However , recipes for chowder were fairly common in English cookbooks ; here is one from The Art of Cookery by Hannah Glasse ( 1789 edition ) : Take a belly piece of pickled pork , slice off the fatter parts , and lay them at the bottom of the kettle , strew over it onions , and such sweet herbs as you can procure , take a middling large cod , bone and slice it , as for crimping , pepper , salt , all-spice , and flour it a little , make a layer with part of the slices , upon that a slight layer of pork again , and on that a layer of biscuit and so on , pursuing the like rule , until the kettle is filled to about four inches cover it with a nice paste , pour in about a pint of water , lute down the cover of the kettle , and let the top be supplied with live wood embers . Keep it over a slow fire about four hours . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the primitive " sea dish " rather than the fancied-up versions . The French and English had fished for cod for centuries and the New Englanders took to it immediately . By way of curiosity , we give a recipe that appears in the Albany edition ( 1796 ) of American Cookery by Amelia Simmons : ChouderTake a bass weighing four pounds , boil half an hour ; take six slices raw salt pork , fry them till the lard is nearly extracted , one dozen crackers soaked in cold water five minutes ; put the bass into the lard , also the pieces of pork and crackers , cover close , and fry for 20 minutes ; serve with potatoes , pickles , apple-sauce or mangoes ; garnish with green parsley . To make Chouder , a Sea Dishp I07The recipe is not only curious but unclear . As it stands it is not a chowder at all in that there is no liquid , but that does not make much sense either because the ingredientsare for a classic inland chowder and the method does not follow any known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing errors ; perhaps she intended that the poaching liquid be added and the dish stewed for twenty minutes , rather than fried . Mrs. Cornelius gives us two recipes for clam chowder , one of which , she says , is made with " long clams " : Fry in a deep kettle two large slices of fat pork . Add three large potatoes , sliced thin , and two quarts of hot water . Boil until the potatoes are not sufficientlydone to break ; then put in pilot-bread crackers , half a pint of milk , a piece of butter large as an egg , a little salt and pepper . When it again boils up , add a pint of clams , with their liquor . Boil one or two minutes , and serve . Just to balance the picture , we should include a clam chowder with tomatoes ? anathema to New Englanders but popular in New York . Pierre Blot , a French chef in New York , gave this one in his Hand-Book of Practical Cookery ( 1867 ) : It is generally admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give below came from the most experienced chowder-men of the Harlem River ... . Put in a pot . .. some small slices of fat salt pork , enough to line the bottom of it ; on that , a layer of potatoes , cut in small pieces ; on the potatoes , a layer of chopped onions ; on onions , a layer of tomatoes , in slices , or canned tomatoes ; on the latter a layer of clams , whole or chopped ( they are generally chopped ) , then a layer of crackers . Then repeat the process ... till the pot is nearly full . Every layer is seasoned with salt and pepper . Other spices are sometimes added according to taste ; such as thyme , cloves , bayleaves , and tarragon.  |p108When  the whole is in , cover with water , set on a slow fire , and when nearly done , stir gently , finish cooking , and serve ... . By mid-century , the trickle of new cookbooks had become a stream . Most of those published in the first half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although they were shamelessly cannibalized by the new wave of authors . Mrs. Randolph suffered particularlyfrom this plagiarism ; for example , her recipe for Hare or Rabbit Soup turns up word for word in Mrs. Porter 's New Southern Cookery Book ( 1871 ) , withoutcredit , of course . The reason for the apparent need for new cookbooks was the revolution taking place in our foodstuffs and technology ? notably , the introduction of steel-rolled flour and the generalization of the newfangled kitchen range . Neither development aided the cause of gastronomy ? on the contrary ? but the cast-iron stove was unquestionablya real improvement in working conditions for women . Before we leave fireplace cookery , a word about the miracles achieved there for millennia by womankind . They fashioned a museumful of brilliant contrivances to ease the back and control the heat . Basic was the swinging crane that brought the pot near to or farther from the fire . In Grandmother in the Kitchen ( 1965 ) , Helen Lyon Adamson describes one ingenious device she says she found in an ( unfortunately unidentified ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mantel directly over the center of the fire . Tie to this one end of a stout worsted string . Truss the thing to be roasted and fasten it in the middle of the string ; tie a stone at the other end to hold it down . Depending on the fire , hang the roast near or away from blaze . Set it turning slowlyp 109by twisting the string as taut as the catgut on a fiddle ; the meat will turn as the string unwinds and then rewindsunder its own momentum . The string must be twisted when it runs down ( about 5 minutes ) and it is work that any child can be set to do and work he will enjoy . In roasting meat this way , it is well to up-end it when half done so that the juice does not gather in one end . Place a dripping-pan under the roast and , before you start , rub the roast with fat and sprinkle it with flour or cornmeal . Baste from the drippings in the pan . To this day , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open fires . At an auberge in the hills of Quercy , in France , where there was no stove , we once partook of an eight-course feast that no French restaurant in America could duplicate . We recall especially a fragrant omelet of truffles , cooked in a longhandledskillet over a fire of vine cuttings . In the mountains of Corsica , people still hang hams and sausages from the rafters , where they gradually acquire from the fireplace the taste and texture that only these ancient methods obtain . Where the stove has come , people tend to stop smoking meats . The new iron oven , while satisfactory for many purposes , did not bake bread and pastries nearly so well as the old brick ovens . Saddest of all was the virtual disappearance of roasted and broiled meats . Ideally , meat and birds should be roasted on the spit . What we call roasting today used to be more properly called baking . Mary Randolph ( Virginia Housewife , 1824 ) says in her recipe for roast turkey to " spit it , and lay it down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brisk ... if it be of a middle size , it will require one hour and a quarter to roast . " ( The turkey was , if anything , larger then than now ; we may safely assume that it was 12 to 15 pounds . ) By the time we get to Fannie Farmer , it is baked for three hours and she pours 2 Y2 cups boiling water into the pan , which is not our idea of roasting . Julia Child , also , gives a true home economist 's recipe inp110From Julia Child 's Kitchen ( 1975 ) : bake a 12- to 16-pound turkey for 3 ? to 41/2 hours at 3250F with an additionalmargin of 30 minutes ! ( She also claims that frozen turkey is " delicious . " ) Lacking a fireplace , one of our main preoccupations has been to bake a turkey so that the flavor and texture approach that of a roasted bird as nearly as possible . We had occasion to print our Thanksgiving turkey recipe in The Tinges. * The principle is to roast the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have yet to roast a 16- to 18-pound turkey more than two hours . Readers wrote in to say that they tried this " unorthodox " method with " trepidation " ; they all pretty much said they would never again roast a turkey the " old " way . But the high-temperature way is the " old " way and , for that matter , the French way . What it lost in subtle aroma and flavor , the stove gained in ease of temperature control . But along with these developments , as noted , came the chemical leavenings , and the craving for sweetness . The new ovens were great for cakes , and women were baking them like mad ? big , sweet , fluffy ones with gooey frostings ? and they wanted new recipes . These changes did not come overnight , but the pace was remarkable . Women leaders , who were active in campaigns for abolition of slavery , for women 's rights , for education , and for child-labor laws , were doubtless persuaded that all change was progress , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were deceived ; the overwhelming majority of women remained as enslaved to their households as before , but their families ate worse . Interesting evidence came in the form of a new genre of cookbook : the collection of favorite recipes of local ladies , often published for charitable purposes . They lack the cohesiveness of a work by a single serious cook , but in some ways they are more revealing of how peoplep111cooked . Among the best-known of the period are The Kansas Home Cook-Book ( Leavenworth , 1874 ) , Housekeepingin Old Virginia ( Louisville , 1879 ) , and Buckeye Cookery ( Minneapolis , 188o ) . The Kansas and Minnesota books are hardly regional ; the number of oyster and clam recipes is astonishing . The sodden macaroni baked with floury white sauce and cheese was spreading , but perhaps the cheese was better . Sweet pickles now outnumbersour , and tomato ketchup now calls for a pound of sugar to a peck of tomatoes . Salad dressings are mostly sweet . Desserts , especially layer cakes , occupy an inordinatespace . While some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , it produced the best of the three books ; cooks there had a great heritage and tended to be more conservative . There is a splendid Sauce for Cod 's Head that calls for the meat of a freshly boiled lobster pulled in bits , ' /2 lb. drawn butter , I spoonful walnut ketchup , I slice lemon , I or 2 slices of horseradish , a little pounded mace , salt , and cayenne pepper , all heated together , with the lemon and horseradish nicely taken out before serving . It is signed Mrs. R ? and is lifted , virtually word for word , from Mrs. Randolph 's recipe of 1824 . Many of her other recipes appear under other names . Mrs. Tyree , of Lynchburg , advises that " Shoat ( which I must explain to the uninitiated is a term appliedin the South to a young pig past the age when it may be cooked whole ) should be kept up and fattened on buttermilk , several weeks before being killed , as this makes the flesh extremely delicate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had to be lovingly blended , roasted , and freshly ground . " Be particular and not allow the coffee to boil , " writes Mrs. Sarah E. Jacobus of Kansas , " as this destroys the peculiar aroma which is the charm of a good cup of coffee . " What is important about these books is that they reflectwhat Americans thought was good eating a centuryp112ago . For comparison , consider the cookbook prepared by the Republican National Committee for the 1972 campaign , with recipes contributed by members of Congress . The reader can consult these in the Appendix ; we have n't the stomach for them here.  |p113All  civilized nations cook their food , to improveits taste and digestibility . The degree of civilization is often measured by thecuisine .

The thirteen elements named are formedinto chemical compounds by the vegetableand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Opening of Fannie Farmer 's Boston Cooking-School Cook Book ( 1896 ) THE ADVENT of Fannie Merritt Farmer was an historic watershed . Before her , women wrote of cooking with love ; she made it a laboratory exercise . She embodied , ifp114that is not too earthy a word , all the major ills of **25;1423;TOOLONG teaching . She was the maiden aunt of home economics . Miss Farmer is often thought to be the founder of the Boston Cooking School . In fact , she studied there , was graduated in 1889 , immediately began to teach , became its principal in 1891 , and published a new textbook for it in 1896 , which became the bible of American kitchens . She may have been the first person who learned cooking in a school and promptly began to teach it to others . This becamestandard American practice . The Boston Cooking School had a solid foundation . Its first principal , Mary Lincoln ( 1879-1885 ) , and a cofounder , Maria Parloa , were excellent cooks . Mrs. Lincoln'sBoston Cook Book ( 1883 ) and Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their day but are now virtually forgotten . A pity . We shall try to remedy this by giving them a major share of the space in comparingthem with Miss Farmer 's work , which is unfortunately widely available . They are also more fun . They were almost the last sensualists among authors of major American cookbooks . Mrs. Lincoln was one of the last of a long line of women writers who learned cooking from their mothers . In an earlier chapter , we quoted her warning about the overuse of baking powders , and her concession to the use of a little sugar in bread to make up for the deterioration of flour . She is much better on kitchen techniques : It requires practice to make puff paste well ; and as there are so many other dishes more easily made and vastly more important , it is better not to waste time and strength on it . Let your ambition as a housekeepersoar higher than perfection in making puff paste . But those who will have it may observe the following directions . They are much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique of producing ap115sheet consisting of hundreds of alternating layers of dough and butter , but they neglect to explain a secret for success : " The number of folds or layers of butter and paste makes the paste flaky , but the amount of air in it makes it rise and puff in baking . " ( Our emphasis . ) That is the reason for the old-fashioned advice to roll lightly and alwaysaway from the body ; a back-and-forth motion is more likely to force out the air . Mrs. Lincoln was similarly perceptive about whipping cream . Rich cream " should be diluted and well mixed with an equal quantity of milk . " Eheu , fugaces . As Beard correctlynotes , even " heavy " cream today will hardly whip ; he recommends the electric mixer . We prefer a whisk . Mrs. Lincoln favors a whip ( paddle ) churn as giving a better consistency than the newfangled egg beater . To a modern reader , Mrs. Lincoln is remarkable for her honesty and her respect for the work of other craftsmen . She gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never widely held but it virtually disappeared from American food writing with the arrival of Miss Farmer . Some of Mrs. Lincoln 's recipes were already very old , and because they reflect our New England culinary heritage , we will reprint some of them here . Forefathers ' DinnerSuccotash is the great dish in Plymouth at every celebrationof Forefathers ' Day , December 22 . Tradition says it has been made in that town ever since the Pilgrimsraised their first corn and beans , and it is supposedthey learned to make it from the Indians . Strangers are rather shy of this peculiar mixture ; but it is a favorite dish with the natives , and to this day is made by some families many times through the winter season . Although the dish has never been made by the writer , it has been tested by her in that ancienttown many times , and the excellence of the followingreceipt is unquestionable . It is given in the name of Mrs. Barnabas Churchill , of Plymouth , a ladyp116who has made it for fifty years after the manner handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans ( not the pea beans ) ; six quarts of hulled corn ? the smutty white Southern corn ; six to eight pounds of corned beef , from , the second cut of the rattle rand ; one pound of salt pork , fat and lean ; chicken weighing from four to six pounds ; one large white French turnip ; eight or ten medium-sized potatoes . Wash the beans , and soak over night in cold water . In the morning put them on in cold soft water . When boiling , change the water , and simmer until soft enough to mash to a pulp and the water is nearly all absorbed . Wash the salt pork and the corned beef , which should be corned only three or four days . Put them on about eight o'clock , in cold water , in a very large kettle , and skim as they begin to boil . Clean , and truss the chicken as for boiling , and put it with the meat about an hour and a quarter before dinner time . Allow a longer time if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kettle . Two hours before dinner time , put the beans , mashed to a pulp , and then hulled corn into another kettle , with some of the fat from the meat in the bottom to keep them from sticking . Take out enough liquor from the meat to cover the corn and beans , and let them simmer where they will not burn . Stir often , and add more liquor if needed . The mixture should be like a thick soup , and the beans should absorb all the liquor , yet it must not be too dry . Pare , and cut the turnip into inch slices ; add it about eleven o'clock , and the potatoes ( pared ) half an hour later . Take up the chicken as soon as tender , that it may be served whole . Serve the beef and pork together , the chicken , turnip , and potatoes each on separate dishes , and the beans and corn in a tureen . The meat usually salts the mixture sufficiently , and no other seasoning is necessary . Save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn and beans the next day , serving the meat cold . This will keep several days in cold weather ; and like many other dishes , it is better the oftener it is warmed over , so there is no objection to making a large quantity.  |p117The  white Southern corn is considered the only kind suitable for this ancient dinner . Notes : We suggest white kidney beans or cannelini . Rattle is an old term for shank or brisket , and rand is a dialect word for a long piece of flesh . Clearly , the dish is a blending of Indian and other influences , but pure Yankee withal , in that it had been made since early Plymouth times . Mrs. Churchill is a frequent contributor to the Lincoln book . Here is her recipe for Indian Meal Pudding : Rub a tablespoonful of butter round the bottom and sides of a smooth iron kettle , ? granite or porcelain will do ; when melted , add half a cup of boiling water . This will prevent the milk from burning . Add one quart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kettle ; then sift in one pint of fine yellow granulated corn meal , sifting with the left hand , and holding the meal high , that every grain may be thoroughly scalded . Stir constantly ; add half a teaspoonful of salt , and set away till cold . Then add half a pint of New Orleans molasses and one quart of cold milk . Put it into a well-buttered deep pudding-dish , cover with a plate , and bake very slowly ten or twelve hours . Put it in a " Saturday afternoon oven " where the fire will keep low nearly all night . Let it remain over night , and serve for Sunday breakfast . Mrs. Lincoln suggests adding a teaspoonful of mustard with one-quarter cup of molasses to a mess of baked beans , explaining , " The mustard gives the beans a delicious flavor , and also renders them more wholesome . " She goes on to say : " Much of the excellence of baked beans dependsupon the bean pot . It should be earthen , with a narrow mouth and bulging sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is said to have been modeled after the Assyrian pots .... Many a New England bean-pot has been carried to the extreme South and West , that people there might have baked beans ' in perfection . "  |p118Mrs  . Poor , another of Mrs. Lincoln 's faithful contributors , gave this recipe : An Old-fashioned Boiled DinnerNotwithstanding that this dish has fallen into ill-repute with many people , it may be prepared so as to be both palatable and nutritious for those who exercise freely . It is more suitable for cold seasons . The most healthful and economical way , though perhaps not the old-fashioned way , is to boil the beef the day before . Four pounds of corned beef , two or three beets , a small cabbage , two small carrots , one small white French turnip , six or eight potatoes of uniform size , and one small crooked-neck squash . Wash and soak the corned beef in cold water , and put it on to boil in fresh cold water ; skim , and simmeruntil tender , but not long enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liquor in which it was boiled . Put it into a flat shallow dish , cover it with a board , and press it . Remove all the fat from the meat liquor , and save it to clarify for shortening . Save the meat liquor , but do not let it stand in an iron kettle or tin pan . Boil the beets the day before , also , and cover them with vinegar . The next day prepare the vegetables . Wash them all , scrape the carrots , and cut the cabbage into quarters ; pare the turnip and squash , and cut into three-quarter-inch slices , and pare the potatoes . Put the meat liquor on to boil about two hours before dinner time ; when boiling , put in the carrots , afterward the cabbage and turnip , and half an hour before dinner add the squash and potatoes . When tender , take the vegetables up carefully ; drain the waterfrom the cabbage by pressing it in a colander . Slice the carrots . Put the cold meat in the centre of a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoesround the edge , with the squash , cabbage , and pickled beets in separate dishes ; or serve each vegetablein a dish by itself . This may all be done thep119same day if the meat be put on to boil very early , removed as soon as tender , the fat taken off , and the vegetables added to the boiling meat liquor , beginning with those which require the longest time to cook . This will depend very much upon their freshness . But whichever way the dish is prepared , boil the beets alone , remove the meat and fat before adding the vegetables , and serve each as whole and daintily as possible . The next morning use what remains of the vegetables as a vegetable hash . It is interesting to note the diffidence with which Mrs. Poor introduced this recipe ; it explains why these old dishes so rarely appeared in printed cookbooks . Yet it is a magnificent dish . Mrs. Poor was clearly an excellent cook who took pains to tell exactly how she made it , but felt compelled to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of her recipes : Bean PorridgeFive pounds of corned beef , not too salt , or four pounds of beef and one of salt pork ; one pint of dry white beans , four tablespoons of corn meal , pepper and salt to taste , one pint of hulled corn . Soak the beans over night . In the morning parboil in fresh waterwith a pinch of soda till soft . Put the corned beef and pork in cold water , skim carefully , and simmer four or five hours , or till tender . Take out , and cut into twoinchpieces , and remove the bone and gristle ; also the fat from the liquor . Put the meat and beans into the meat liquor , and simmer very slowly three or four hours , or till most of the beans are broken . Half an hour before serving stir in the meal , first wetting it in cold water to a smooth paste . The meal should thicken the porridge to about the consistency of a thick soup . The meat should be cooked till it falls apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hulled corn , and when hot serve with brown bread . Sometimesp120the vegetables usually served with a boiled dinner are cooked with the meat , then removed , and the beans cooked as above , in the meat liquor . " This old-fashioned and very nutritious dish was one of the chief articles of winter food at my grand , mother 's farm in Northern New Hampshire eighty years ago . When cooked , it was poured into bowls or basins holding from a pint to two quarts . A nice tow string was laid in a loop over the edge , and the porridge was placed where it would freeze . By holding the dish in hot water it would cause the porridge to slip out ; then it was hung up by the loops in the buttery , ' and was considered best when nine days old . ' At early dawn the men folks ' who went into the forest chopping ' would take the skillet , or a little three-legged iron kettle , some large slices of rye and Indian ' bread in their pockets to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clean towel , upon the sled stakes . Their spoons were made of wood . The hay that lay on the floor of the ox sled was of use to keep their feet warm , and given to the oxen for bait ' at noon . When it was twelve o'clock by the sun , ' they kindled a fire by the aid of a tinder box , ' warmed their porridge , and with their brown bread enjoyed this strong food as no modern epicure can his costly French dishes . " It is to be remarked that this recipe was given to Mrs. Lincoln prior to 1883 , so we are being permitted a glimpse of daily life around 1800 , and there is every reason to believe that the dish is much older . The pinch of soda is interesting ; it means that the water in northern New Hampshire was hard . ( One of the bits of lore that an assiduous reader of old cookbooks learns is that dried peas and beans must be cooked in soft water ; old French books specify river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , fresh peas and beans are to be cooked in hard water ; it preserves color and texture better . ) It is interesting also that Mrs. Poor felt obliged to put in quotation marks the word " Indian " when referring to cornmeal . As noted , while the early settlers learned ap121great deal from the Indians ? cornmeal , parched corn , hoecake , and much more ? all the so-called Indian pudding and bread recipes we know were clearly adaptations of English recipes using Indian meal . An example is Maria Parloa 's recipe for Indian Waffles in The Kitchen Companion(1887) . Maria Parloa was an interesting writer who reportedly studied with Pierre Blot in New York , headed her own cooking school there , and wrote several books before helping to found the Boston Cooking School . She must have influenced a whole generation of cooks and cookbookwriters , but she seems to be totally forgotten today . She seems to have had a better knowledge of French cuisine than do many of our modern " gourmet " cooks . She understood the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unavailable , she says , grapefruit might be tried because " it has a little of the peculiar bitter flavor that makes the Seville orange desirable . " Of the new bleached asparagus she says , " it is an unfortunate fashion , for the vegetable does not compare in flavor or tenderness with the old-fashioned green asparagus . " Like Jefferson seventy-five years earlier , Miss Parloa offers a market list that includes all the common vegetables and herbs , and many that may be hard to find in a friendly neighborhood supermarket today : salsify , kohl-rabi , egg-plant , okra , celeriac , shallots , rocamboles , Spanish onions , escarole , Monk 's beard ( endive ) , garden and water cress , sorrel , lamb 's lettuceor corn salad , chervil , borage , and tarragon . But she is not a lifted-pinky gourmet . She is not above giving us an admirable recipe for a plebeian Yankee dish , such as this one : A Salt-fish DinnerOutside New England a salt-fish dinner is hardly known , and even in that section it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the towns bordering on the coast . To the uninitiated it mayp122seem to be a very insignificant meal ; but to those who know what it really is , few dinners are more attractive . The preparation of a salt-fish dinner calls for care and skill . The materials should be of the very best . Codfish is the only suitable fish to use , and dunfishis better than white ; the process of curing the former being preferable to that of curing white fish , and the result being a darker and richer fish .... The fish never should be cut before cooking . Preparation of the FishA genuine salt-fish dinner is composed of a whole salt cod , beets , carrots , onions , potatoes , salt pork , butter , hard-boiled eggs , flour , salt , and pepper . The night before the dinner is to be served , wash the fish carefully .... Put the fish into a large pan , skin side up ; and soak it over night in sufficient water to cover it . The next day place the fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan . Place on the fire where the water will heat slowly to the boiling-point without actually boiling ; then set back where it will keep hot for five or six hours . If care be taken not to let the fish boil , it will break into soft , rich , gelatinous flakes when served ; but if it be boiled , it will be dry , thready , and hard . Miss Parloa goes on to describe in great detail the cookingof each vegetable , and the slow frying of the cubes of salt pork until they become brown and crisp . Now here is her recipe for the obligatory egg sauce that goes with it : Egg sauce is made by beating together half a cupful of butter and a table-spoonful of flour ; adding half a pint of boiling water ; setting the saucepan on the fire , and stirring until the sauce begins to boil ; immediately drawing the saucepan back , and adding half a teaspoonfulof salt and half a salt-spoonful of white pepper ; chopping two hard-boiled eggs rather fine , ? doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the mixture already prepared.  |p123These  homey dishes are part of our heritage , yet recipes for them are surprisingly rare . Miss Parloa 's instructions for boiling the salt cod are most perceptive , and characteristic of her entire repertory . In preparing the vegetables , she says , " Beets may be boiled without washing . When they are washed , the little roots are apt to be broken , and the juices escape . This impoverishes the vegetables and spoils the color . " It is a splendid dish , lovingly and intelligently presented . While the egg sauce , purely English in origin , can not be compared to the aiolli , the dish stands up in its own way to the great boiled salt cod dinner of Provence , which is also called aiolli because of the obligatory accompaniment of that redolent amalgam of garlic and fruity olive oil . Mrs. Lincoln and Miss Parloa , then , were good cooks , who with some embarrassment yielded to the decline in produce and standards of their time . With Fannie Farmer , embarrassment disappears , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the opening lines of the Lincoln and the Farmer textbooks . Mrs. Lincoln puts taste first , Miss Farmer chemical composition . ( All of our schools of home economics do the same today . ) Miss Farmer 's first recipe tells how to detect the presence of starch ( C6H1005 ) by the addition of a weak solution of iodine ; it will turn " an intense blue . " Scrumptious . As noted , Miss Farmer 's book early became , and still remains , the bible of the American kitchen ; now in its twelfth edition , it has sold more than three million copies . A certain mythology has grown up around it . In the current paperback edition , for example , it is claimed that she " invented " precise measurements of ingredients by volume rather than by weight . This would be a dubious honor , if it were true . As early as 1845 , Mrs. Webster was counseling her readersto measure by volume , and we learn from her chart that " sixteen Spoonfuls are half a pint . " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent three and a half pages on how to measure accurately . " An even or scant teaspoonful means the spoon filled lightly , and levelled off with a knife . " The measuring cup , we learn , had been accepted for decades as containing one-half pint , and was marked to show one-quarter and one-third cups . She maintained that , with her table of measures , " the cup and spoon may be used as accurately as the scales . " So while Miss Farmer did ban forever the rounded measure and " butter the size of an egg , " ( an old-standby direction , translated by Mrs. Lincoln as one-quarter cupful or two ounces ) , she introduced nothing new . We repeat that , where accuracy is necessary , weight is more precise than volume . Any real cook knows that eggs are not identical , that flours vary astonishingly , that bakingpowders are not all alike , and that even salt varies in saltiness ; blind dependence on accurate measurements is naive . Finally , one must depend on feel and taste . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too sensual . Her attitude became the law for American food editing . When the singer Pearl Bailey wrote an earthy , loving cookbook about the art her mother had taught her , the question of measurements arose . " Can you measure life ? " she retorted . " How can I tell you ? I do n't know how much you want to put in . " The trouble is that many people no longer know how much they themselves want . A woman in a New York publishing house complained , " I never know what they mean when they say , season to taste . ' " While Mrs. Lincoln attributed many of her recipes to the donors , including Miss Parloa , " Mrs. Towne 's Matilda , " " an unknown friend , " and so on , the only source credited in Miss Farmer is an unidentified " French Chef , " to whom she assigns several exotic recipes such as mulligatawny soup . Clearly , she did not create hundreds of recipes out of the blue . She learned cooking from Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School at the time ) , but did not acknowledge it in any way . Now , recipes that have many sources need not be attributed ; Miss Fannie , however , exaggerated in this regard . She was by no means the first to appropriate other people 's recipes as her own , but as the patron saint of American housewives she put her seal of approval on it , and contributed to the moral climate of the cookbook world today , where plagiarism is the norm . Among other things , this practice cuts us off from the past , so charmingly revealed by some of the Lincoln recipes quoted earlier . We have mentioned how Miss Farmer hyped up her breads with ever-increasing amounts of sugar . She poured it on with a heavy hand in whatever she was doing . Take salad dressings : In the original 1896 edition , there are thirteen recipes , of which ten have sugar ? including the mayonnaise . By the 1914 edition , the last one that Miss Farmer edited , fourteen out of seventeen salad recipes have sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , added sugar to her tomato aspic . By the 1965 edition , we have this horror : For a special variation , put in a jar cup commercialmayonnaise , V2 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar ( more seasonings if you like ) and shake well . This American fixation on sweet salads , so well documentedin the succeeding editions of Fannie Farmer , was , shall we say , firmly set by the invention of Jell-O in 1897 , a fitting close to the late nineteenth century with its steady decline of taste . Sugary , gummy messes , chock full of synthetic flavors and colors , blanketed the country . Fruit salads , each less believable than the preceding one , dominated the salad section of the 1914 Boston CookingSchoolCook Book . Lemon Jell-O now was the popular substitute for aspic . There is a Brazilian Salad that begins , " Remove skin and seeds from white grapes and cut in halves lengthwise , " and goes on with pineapple , apples ,  |p126celery  , Brazil nuts ( whence the name of the dish ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pours the syrup from a can of peaches into the Jell-O .... Miss Farmer had already , in 1896 , given us this gem : Remove one section of skin from each of four bananas . Take out fruit , scrape , and cut fruit from one banana in thin slices , fruit from other three bananas in one-half inch cubes . Marinate cubes with French Dressing . Refill skins and garnish each with slices of banana . Stack around a mound of lettuce leaves . It must have made a charming display . That is pure women's-magazine gourmet cookery . Insane " fancy " combinations of ingredients without regard to balance of taste and texture are commonplace now ; a favorite of ours is a published recipe for a hamburger with chopped peanuts and bananas , including the instruction : " Mash bananas with mustard to taste . " But it was unusual in Miss Farmer 's time . It is clear that the dour spinster had at least one vice : a craving for sugar . This may have been the secret of her success , which is otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were turning to sugar , and Miss Farmer was there to give it to them . In her 1914 edition there are five recipes involving marshmallows ; soon , they would be added to salads ... . Her sauces were so full of flour they could nearly stand up alone ? her Bordelaise Sauce calls for 3 ? tablespoons of flour for 1 cup of stock . She calls for eight minutes of simmering in this recipe , an unprecedented concession to finesse ( Escoffier calls for some 41/2 hours , minimum , and uses less than one tablespoon of flour ) . Her other sauces call for no simmering whatsoever , even the bechamel . The lady was a very poor cook , and singlehandedly was responsiblefor a great deal of what is wrong with modern American cooking . It is a mystery how James Beard was able to say for the jacket of the facsimile 1896 edition : " Fannie Farmer remains one of our gastronomic deities !  |p127She  was equally at home with the traditions of American cooking and the intricacies of French cuisine . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief look at the history of sauces in America . On the frontier , of course , the sharpest sauce was a good appetite ; the foods were good , in the main , but there was neither time nor ingredients for such refinements . The well-to-do colonists , as noted , relied on English cookbooks from the golden age of English cookery . The sauces were most often formed in the cooking process , as in fricassees and stews . The older ones were not thickened at all , but simplyserved with sippets ( dry-toasted bread ) to sop up the broth . Occasionally , bread and sippets were allowed to soak and simmer imperceptibly until they were integrated into the sauce ? what the French call mitonner , a process still used in country soups . Elegant kitchens used egg yolks , butter , and cream for liaison of sauces ; this was still most often recommended by Hannah Glasse as late as 1805 . Amelia Simmons ( 1796 ) treated sauces only in passing . Water fowl requires onion sauce , she says . This would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pureed , and mixed with thick cream . Miss Simmons suggests that a fowl have " a pint of stewed oysters , well buttered and peppered . " Gravy meant the natural meat juices and was often simply " buttered and a spoonful of catsup added . " Until the second half of the nineteenth century , ketchup usually meant a pickle of mushrooms , oysters , or walnuts . Mrs. Randolph gave a recipe for tomato ketchup in 1824 and it quickly became popular , but it was specified as such . A sophisticated and elegant cook , Mrs. Randolph most frequentlycalled for a sauce of melted butter and parsley . Occasionally , she added a spoonful of mushroom ketchup . Sometimes she used butter or yolks to thicken a sauce , but the butter would likely be first rolled in flour ? 2 teaspoonsof flour to 1/2 pound of butter ? a sort of beurre manie . The proportion of flour to butter is about one/fourth the classic formula ( equal amounts by volume ) , so it can be seen that butter was the main liaison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotesan entire chapter to sauces . Most of them have no flour whatsoever but a few call for beurre ranie . There is a section on Store Fish Sauces , meaning sauces that keep well . Here is an interesting one : General SauceChop six shalots or small onions , a clove of garlic , two peach leaves , a few sprigs of lemon-thyme and of sweet basil , and a few bits of fresh orange-peel . Bruise in a mortar a quarter of an ounce of mace , and half an ounce of long pepper . Mix two ounces of salt , a jill 1/2 cup of claret , the juice of two lemons , and a pint of Madeira . Put the whole of these ingredients together in a stone jar , very closely covered . Let it stand all night over embers by the side of the fire . In the morning pour off the liquid quickly and carefully from the lees or settlings , strain it and put it into small bottles , dipping the cork in melted rosin . This sauce is intended to flavour melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a common practice to add such homemade sauces to melted butter ; if they were well made and used with discretion they must have been excellent . At least , they had character ; the butter gave richness and texture , and there was an interesting tang and aroma from the better of those " Store " sauces . What came later had all the charm of library paste . White sauce , or bechamel , became the rage . It was believedto be very French . Indeed , the quality of French sauces also declined in the nineteenth century , but the French would never have recognized the bechamel and Espagnole recipes that began to appear in American cookbooks , and clog them to this day . From the beginning , they demonstrated our infantile desire to achieve dazzling results with no expenditure ofp129time or effort . We wanted to do " fancy cooking " without learning the techniques required . In this effort , Fannie Farmer was a trailblazer . Beginning with her , the home economists , nutritionists , and instant chefs pushed aside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other noncooks . No longer were taste , texture , freshness of produce lovingly discussed . Nor would technique be sensual , and individual . From now on , things would be measured by the one-eighth teaspoon and the milligram of riboflavin . Welcome to the twentieth century . Fannie reigned unchallenged until the Joy of Cooking by Irma S. Rombauer appeared in 1931 . The first edition was privately printed ; it was an immediate success and it is claimed to be the best-selling cookbook of all time . The book 's prime virtue is its chattiness ; Mrs. Rombauer wrote about cooking with enthusiasm if not discernment . Indeed , it is said that she wrote the book in protest against the antiseptic , loveless approach of Fannie Farmer . There are good things in Rombauer ; she tells us how to churn butter , how to make cheese , how Janka made strudel , and how the sausages were seasoned at butchering time in their valley . Unfortunately , the book has many of the flaws we have been discussing , such as sugar in the bread recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortening , and 5 teaspoons of sugar for a small batch ? the French permit only flour , yeast , salt , and water ) . There is the usual appallingcollection of sweet gelatin salads and dressings . The 1943 edition devoted eight pages to canned-soup combinations ; one of them is for Mongole Soup : I should like to sing a paean of praise about this and the following soups made with a basis of pea and tomato . If there is anything better in the hurry-up culinary art I do n't know what it is . Rich ? Yes , but you may plan to serve simple food afterward . This is worth adding a fraction of a pound to your avoirdupois . Only do n't fall in love with it and serve it too often.  |p130The  ingredients for this masterpiece of hurry-up culinaryart are : I can condensed tomato soup , I can condensedpea soup , 2 cups top milk , salt , paprika , sherry , and grated cheese . This recipe does not appear in the 1975 edition but ' a variation does : Quick Crab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what is essentially the same mixture as above , with the interesting substitution of 3 tablespoons dry white wine for the sherry . Nothing could be more " gourmet " than this undiscriminating use of " dry white wine , " and no recipe could better illustrate the lack of understanding of basic culinary principles and of plain good taste that prevail in American fancy cookingtoday.  |p131The  Recipe Racket ... If all the writers upon Cookery hadacknowledged from whence they took theirreceipts , as I do , they would have actedwith more candour by the public . Theirvanity to pass for Authors , instead of Compilers , has not added to their reputation . Mrs. Mary Cole , in The Lady 's Complete Guide(1791) , which we hasten to add was brought toour attention by Judith Herman and MargueriteShalett Herman in Cornucopia . A CAREER GIRL confided recently that she had been engaged to write a cookbook . A friend of ours , who was raised in a Protestant school , asked , " Whatever gives you the right to do that ? " The author said , " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Short of hard-core pornographythere is , we think , no branch of publishing more cynical than that concerned with food ? so much so that honest writing seems unprofessional to the trade . Not long ago , when one of the authors submitted a requested article to The New York Times Magazine on the history of a dish , she was asked to " change the recipes a little bit " so that the two books she had quoted need not be credited . She refused.  |p132TableNote  : Both recipes purport to be from Le Viandier ( c. 1375 ) , long credited to one Guillaume Tirel , dit Taillevent . Taillevent'sSoupe en Moustarde ( manuscript in Bibliotheque Nationale , Paris ) involves eggs fried in deep fat served in a soup of wine , oil , water , and fried onions all simmered together with toast , with mustard added before serving . The recipe could hardly be more different from the one presented by Aresty and Cranwell.  |p133If  we may steal the old joke about the Hungarian recipe that begins , " First you steal a chicken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cookbook is , first you steal a lot of recipes . This goes back a long way . The earliest extant cookbook of the Western world bears the name of one Marcus Gavius Apicius ( circa 25 B.c. ? 3o A.D. ) . According to Bertrand Guegan , a French scholar , the recipes were apparently collated around 230 A.D. by an unknown cook , and many of them appear to have been lifted from the Greeks . The earliest known French cookbook , Le Viandier , is always credited to Guillaume Tirel , called Taillevent , chef to Charles V and Charles VI . It was thought to have been written around 1375 and at least by the time of Francois Villon ( 1431 ? 1463 ? ) the name Taillevent had become a synonym for chef . Unfortunately for the accepted tradition , a rolled parchment called the Sion manuscript turned up some years ago in Switzerland . Paul Aebischer , in the scholarly Vallesia , reprints it and says , " What we have here is a Viandier by Taillevent before Taillevent . " He goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century before Guillaume Tirel 's copy . An interesting aside on the Taillevent work . The French have always been faintly embarrassed by the actual recipes ; they find them bizarre ? too many spices . To a Moroccancook they would not seem strange at all . There certainly is a Saracen aroma . And why not ? The Moors had been as far north as Poitiers and were still raiding now and then in the Midi . Also , the lunatic Crusades were a very real memory ; the Arabs were still preeminent in medicine and they had controlled the spice trade for centuries ; spices were a luxury and therefore de rigueur in the kitchens of the king . Mrs. Mary Cole , in 1791 , complained that cookbook plagiarism was much practiced in eighteenth-century Englandand cited such illustrious borrowers as Hannah Classe and Elizabeth Raffald . In the nineteenth century , it was rampant . The cannibalization of Eliza Acton 's rep134markable work , Modern Cookery for Private Families ( 1845 ) , is difficult to believe . A small example : " MademoiselleJenny Lind 's Soup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cook " and " obtained through the kindness of a Miss Bremer , " becomes in Mrs. Beeton 's Household Management ( 1861 ) Soup a la Cantatrice , with the measurements ever so cunningly changed . Mrs. Beeton'swork , a tome of over 2100 recipes and hundreds of items of household information , had to have been lifted . She bore four children and died at the age of twentyeight . It seems doubtful that she had time even to try the recipes . Elizabeth David discusses why Mrs. Beeton 's book ( and others such as Cassell 's Dictionary of Cookery ) eclipsed the superior work of Eliza Acton . " The English public had become accustomed to cookery-books put together by syndicates of editors and recipe compilers rather than written as the expression of one author 's experience and beliefs . In other words , housewives and cooks did not read cookery books , they merely looked up recipes . Our emphasis . A book such as Miss Acton 's , written as a coherentwhole , is essentially one to be read as written , with intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us turn to America . In Mrs. Porter 's New Southern Cookery Book ( 1871 ) may be found , word for word except for an obvious error in copying , the unattributed recipe for " Hare or Rabbit Soup " from The Virginia Housewife ( 1824 ) by Mary Randolph . Fannie Farmer , in much the same way as Mrs. Beeton in England , plagiarizedand outsold superior books . American women seem to be so insecure about cooking that they buy only books that bear the seal of approval of a well-known institution . It matters little whether it be the Boston Cooking School , Good Housekeeping , McCall 's , Time ? Life , or The New York Times ; it will sell so long as it is spelled out in big fat print on the cover . In contrast , the finest cookbooks of recent years have rep135mained succes d'estime . One thinks of Marcella Hazan , whose Classic Italian Cuisine never strays far from the food she loves and grew up with in Northern Italy . ( " Buy a piece of cheese and grate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her readers will buy stale , dusty grated cheese that never saw Italy . ) Or Diana Kennedy , who spent years of study in Mexico before coming up with what is considered a definitive work , The Cuisines of Mexico . Or the remarkable book by Paula Wolfert , Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco , which exokes the wonderfully exciting sounds and smells of the souk ( market ) and the attarine ( spice stall ) ? the Eastern fragrances of a highly sophisticated cuisine . Or take Richard Olney 's Simple French Food , a fascinating book about not so simple French cooking , written by a discriminating cook for intelligent readers . Or take Madeleine Kamman , whose serious work , The Making of a Cook ( 1971 ) , was politely received and had a modest sale while her more recent Dinner Against the Clock , which she herself puts down as " good quality trash , " was enthusiastically reviewed , won awards , and is selling at a better rate than the first . One can only conclude that cookbook buyers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up a fancy recipe , and presto ! , dazzle their guests . Where do the recipes come from ? Peg Bracken , who qualified as an authority by the wildfire success of her / Hate to Cook Book , writes in Family Circle ( October1974 ) that one of the best sources of recipes is the back of the package " because a manufacturer would have to be awfully dumb to put a bad one there . " She added that recipes out of magazines were " exceptionally reliable becausethe magazine 's Home Ec staff is too busy cooking and tasting and experimenting to answer all the bad temperedletters they would get if they were n't good ... whereas a cookbook writer might have skipped the countrylong ago . " Publishers , food manufacturers , and the public labor under the misapprehension that home economists and nu/tritionists are qualified to test and devise recipes . Actually , cooking is not a required subject in colleges that grant such degrees ( who , indeed , would teach it ? ) and where it is taught at all , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food preparation . Consider the tale of Nikki Goldbeck , holder of a degree in nutrition from Cornell University 's Home Ec school , now called the School of Human Ecology ? which has n't used a stove since its cafeteriawas replaced by vending machines . Ms. Goldbeck is the young author of several well-intentioned cookbooks aimed at the Granola generation . In one of them , she confesses that on graduation she had been hired to develop " recipes for unflavored gelatin , a product I had never even heard of . " She had evidently entered the recipe racket thinking that gelatin came in six horrible , sugary synthetic flavors . A secretary in an advertising agency on Madison Avenueconfides that she was ordered to whip up a list of recipes for a client , a cracker manufacturer ; she went to the library , copied a dozen recipes , and doubled the amount of cracker meal in each one . And that , Peg Bracken , is where recipes on packages come from . As for magazine recipes , here is one chosen at random from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chocolate Pudding Cream Pie . It 's cream cheese , milk , and instant chocolate pudding all Bucked together and dumped into one of those horrible store-bought pie crusts . Or one may invite Bracken to savor this lovely recipe from the package of a best-selling plastic chicken heavily promoted on television : 1 chicken , 1 bottle Russiandressing , 1 envelope dehydrated onion soup mix , 1 jar ( 10-ounce ) apricot preserves . Bon appetit . Many of the cookbook authors we know do not really care about food ; such people will put out a book with scissors and paste . How could it be otherwise ? He ( or she , as the case may be ) will crib recipes from here and there , changing the amounts ever so slightly , and if hep137goes so far as to test the recipes himself , he will consider it a job well done . Publishers are addicted to trends , and natural foods are one of the latest . One only has to dump in a spoonful of wheat germ and honey here and there to publish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors who dump into standard recipes a lot of wine or a glug of spirits and call it Cooking with Wine . A book of that genre was committed by Ruth Ellen Church ( also known as Mary Meade ) , described as " the award-winning food editor of the Chicago Tribune . " She tells us that the French set the following rules for wine with cheese : I. Never serve cheese with a sweet wine . She has never heard of Chateau d'Yquem with Roquefort. 2 . Always serve red wine with cheese . The French usually do , but in white-wine districts they drink what they produce . Also , many French gastronomes maintain that the finesse of a great red wine can not hold up against a blue cheese , for example : you are better off with the coarser reds , the whites , and even sweet wines , as noted above . 3 . Any cheese will do , except cream cheese or goat milk cheese . What does she think the French drink with goat cheese ? Coca-Cola ? If you have the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vigneron is likely to flatter his wine and your palate with a bit of homemade goat cheese , inelegantly called crottin ( turd ) . The great AliBab , French gastronome , notes : " Goat cheeses bring out remarkably the bouquet of wine . " ( Before we leave advice on cheese , though , we must quote from an ad for The Cheese Handbook by T. A. Layton . The ad reproduces part of a page on which Manchego , a Spanish sheep cheese , is described as follows : " Butter fat content very high , production very uneven in duality as it is made by peasants . " ) Among what Miss Church describes as " very special , gourmet recipes , " she puts 8 oz. of tomato sauce , oregano , and basil in Burgundy Pot Roast , she puts sugar in Coqp138au Vin , and she uses bouillon cubes nearly everywhere . Her salads are mostly viscous sweet messes , but " Seafood Mousse Louise " has cachet : I tablespoon gelatin , % cup sherry , ' /2 cup water , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoon lemon juice , ' /2 cup heavy cream , I cup flaked cooked or canned crabmeat , I cup finely cut shrimp , 6 hard-cooked eggs , grated , 4 oz. chopped ripe olives , 2 teaspoons each of parsley and pimiento , grated onion , lemon peel and Worcestershire sauce , a dash of Tabasco , salt , and pepper . Poor Louise . Now that " ethnic " food is fashionable , there are pitfalls for the unwary borrower . In Rebecca Caruba 's Cooking with Wine and High Spirits , we find a recipe for Bouillabaissea la Caen . Olive oil , tomatoes , garlic , and saffron in the heart of Normandy ? She says , " Only the eel has been eliminated and if you care to add it , you will have an authentic bouillabaisse as served at Caen . " It would hardly be less authentic if served in Marseilles . An authentic recipe , clearly , is one that is true to its basic principles . From time to time , a talented cook may devise a delicious variation on a regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with different ingredientsand tools may add an original and useful dimension . Such variations should , however , be noted . It is not only morality that is at issue in crediting the source of a recipe . ( We do not propose a list of sources for such common recipes as pancakes , for instance , althoughmany everyday recipes become more interesting if one knows their provenance . ) We all stand on the shoulders of our forebears . It 's rather like archaeology ; recipes are part of our culture , and they will tell us a great deal about ourselves and our past if we but exercise intellectual honesty . As we have suggested before , and will show again , good food writers are scrupulous in such matters , while snitchers are invariably botchers . They are slovenly thinkers and poor craftsmen who do not understand the construction of a dish , and they willp139destroy its balance and harmony because they are intent on disguising the fact that it is stolen property . Among chefs there are very few secrets . They are highly trained professionals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among housewives , however , it is very different . Many years ago , at the Methodist Church in Housatonic , Massachusetts , we ate the best baked beans we ever hope to eat . Could we have the recipe ? The dear lady was pleased to give it . We were not too surprised when , on trying it , the dish , while delicious , was not exactly the same as the one she had served . A village woman who is noted for making the best beans in the township may be excused for keeping her secret . There is a story in France ( surely apocryphal , and told in different versions ) about the aged Bressane woman on her deathbed who had never divulged her secret with fricasseed chicken . ( She had only sons , and one does not give such secrets to daughters-in-law . ) As she lay , waxen and motionless , surrounded by a large and loving family , she beckoned to her favorite granddaughter and whisperedhoarsely in her ear ; " Three drops of juice " ? a pause , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " de citron " ( of lemon ) , and expired . A secret was kept in another way by Craig Claiborne in The New York Times ( June 13 , 1974 ) . " We recently contrived a splendid sauce for smoked fish ... made with horseradish , sour cream and ground walnuts . It is to feast . " It calls for 1 cup sour cream , cup heavy cream , %s cup grated horseradish , 1 4-oz. can walnuts , 1 tablespoon sugar , and salt to taste . Escoffier 's standard text , Le Guide Culinaire ( 192I edition ) , publishes such a contrivance on page 49 : 9 oz. grated horseradish , 9 oz. walnuts , 1 teaspoonsalt , 1 tablespoon sugar , and nearly 11 cups thick cream . ( Transcribed to American measures . ) In Claiborne , the proportion of walnuts and horseradish has been somewhatreduced , and sour cream has been substituted for creme fra " ache . Elizabeth David has translated Escoffier's account of his being served this sauce with omble chevalier ( a fish found in certain Alpine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ends the piece with : " For my part , I have never forgotten the sauce of horseradishand walnuts . " Escoffier , be it noted , did not claim to have contrived this sauce . Only five weeks earlier , Claiborne had bragged , " We can quote chapter and verse about the world of Georges Auguste Escoffier , the man who is to the Gallic table what games are to Hoyle . " ( Surely he meant what Hoyle is to games , but never mind . ) He went on to confide that he had only just then heard of Edouard Nignon , a famous contemporary of Escoffier , regarded by many French gastronomes as a finer cook and certainly a far more interesting writer on food . Claiborne credited one recipe , Truites Farcis ( sic ) Fernand Point , but Point would not have been pleased . The recipe came from the hand of one Jean Banchet , who claimed to have gotten it from Point . Perhaps . Point 's famous recipe for Truites Farcies appears in his posthumousbook , Ma Gastronomie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ago by Mme. Point and have made the dish a number of times . For the stuffing , Point took carrot , mushrooms , truffle , and a stalk of celery , chopped them , simmered them briefly in butter , added a bit of flour , stirred in two egg yolks , added salt and pepper , and allowed the mixture to cool . The braising ingredients for the trout were aromatics , butter , and about a cup of port , and that is all . To finish the sauce , he added three good spoonfuls of thick cream , a bit of beurre manie ( kneaded butter and flour , the size of a hazelnut ) , and a good chunk of butter to the pan juices . The recipe that appeared in The Times called for the mushrooms to be boiled ( ! ) in cup cream ; yet another 1/4 cup was added , plus the murderous amount of five tablespoons of flour . In the cooking liquid appear shallots , leeks , garlic , one cup white wine plus about one cup more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notp141one of these ingredients appears in the original recipe . Almost as serious as the presence of white wine , which totally changes the balance of flavors , is the fact that the amount of liquid is nearly quadrupled . This changes braising into poaching , quite a different process . BanchetClaibornenow add two more cups of cream to the cookingliquid , which is then heavily reduced , and the sauce is " finished " with hollandaise sauce . " On doit la verite aux morts , " Voltaire said . ( One owes truth to the dead . ) If there is anything worse than garden-variety plagiarism , it is such vandalism practiced on established works by translators and editors . In French classic cuisine , nomenclature is highly codified . The bible of today 's haute cuisine is Le Guide Culinaire ( 1902 ) by Escoffier . Chefs can be exasperatingly vague about the amounts of the ingredients , which are often left to one 's discretion , but the presence or absence of a single herb may change the name of the dish . Thus , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of Genevoise , " meaningthat it is a red-wine fumet from braising fish , suitably reduced , seasoned , and whipped up with butter . It puts you on notice that he did not follow the consecrated formula in some way ; it may be an improvement , or it may not . If the chef is famous enough , the variation may bear his name . This is essentially what happened with Escoffier . He often changed dishes that antedated him while retaining the designation ? some of which were created by Careme ( 1784 ? 1833 ) ? but the Escoffier version has become the definitive one , and any variations must be carefully attributed . Esther B. Aresty , in The Delectable Past ( 1964 ) , mangles masterpieces with an almost charming innocence . For " Apician Ham and Figs " she starts out with a canned ham , missing the point that the enzymes in the figs helped to tenderize the ham , which was probably pretty tough . More serious is her addition of cheese to Veau Villageoise , a recipe by Menon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advicep142of Archestratus , classical Greek poet and gastronome , whom she had quoted earlier : All other waysAre quite superfluous , such as when cooks pour A lot of sticky clammy sauce upon it , Parings of cheese , and lees , and dregs of oil , As if they were preparing cat 's meat . In The New York Times Magazine ( February 11 , 1973 ) under the heading " Fernand Would Have Liked Naomi 's Marjolaine , " Raymond Sokolov gave a " translation " of Point 's famous gateau . What 's Naomi to Fernand or he to Naomi that he should need her help ? Sokolov explains : " Recipes for the rich dessert , with its three cream fillings , are in print but are unworkable , because they are n't entirely authentic . Our emphasis . To the rescue came Naomi Rubenstein , who had tasted marjolaine chez Point , then set about creating this practical set of directionsin her Brooklyn home . " He neglects to tell us that one of the recipes in print is from the hand of the master himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question its authenticity and it is a perfectly clear , workable recipe . There are a number of differences between the two marjolaines , the most serious of which are the following : For 8 egg whites , 8 oz. almonds , and 51/4 oz. hazelnuts , Point calls for 21 tablespoons sugar and only 2 ' tablespoonsflour ; Naomi calls for i cup sugar and 4 tablespoons flour . ( Conversion to American measures . ) Point bakes his marjolaine for three or four minutes at 392 ? F ; Naomi bakes hers for 40 to 50 minutes at 3000 F. ( She specifies that it should " solidify and dry out , " a crucial difference . ) Point works the butter for his cream filling to a pommade ; Naomi melts it , something no classically trained patissier would do . Finally , Point strews his cake with chocolate sprinkles ; Naomi does not . Point seems to be a favorite victim of the manglers . His foie gras en brioche , more than the marjolaine ,  |p143demonstrates  the essential qualities of his lovely cuisine . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bresse , and his mother and grandmother were very fine cooks ) have for centuries been tucking the wonderful local sausage into brioche dough and bakingit . Marvelous food . Point did it with foie gras . He was likely not the first to have done so , but he brought it to sublime heights . There is no secret about it , however . The fact is that Point did very little cooking in his last years and , according to his disciples , he was not secretive about his recipes . Here are the essentials of Point 's recipe as given in his book , omitting only certain details of preparation : take a beautiful foie gras ( fresh ) and marinate it for 24 hours in port , armagnac , and aromatics . Insert a fresh truffle , wrap the liver , coat it with chicken fat ( melted , but not hot , he warns ? a fine point showing his awareness of pitfalls for less experienced cooks ) , cover , and cook in a bain marie at 2120 F for 30 minutes . Cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no sugar , he specifies ) and cover with the same dough . Allow to rise , and bake for about 40 minutes . Unmold and serve hot or cold . Voila . For a chef , it is a remarkably clear and precise recipe . If you have the courage , let us turn to The Chef 's Secret Cook Book by Louis Szathmary . He tells us that Point " took to the grave the secret of a brioche filled with goose liver , " so the young chef who took over the kitchen at La Pyramide " invented a perfect substitute . " Szathmary gives us the " secret " recipe : I loaf sliced white bread , I long round or triangular can pate imported from France or a good quality smoked liver sausage ( Braunschweiger ) , I cup canned chicken broth , I envelopeunflavored gelatin , 3 tablespoons water , I teaspoon lemon juice , 1/2 teaspoon sugar . You slice the pate , cut matching holes in the bread slices into which you fit the pate and , finally , coat the ghastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the cookbook industry , a major problem is that most cooks can not write and most editors and cookbook writers can not cook . Charles Virion , a French cook who lives in America , once allowed a magazine to publish his recipe for chocolate souffle . Years later , the editor asked him to let her include it in a book . At that time , he was preparing his own book and so he refused ? in writing . The editor 's book appeared with the recipe , nevertheless . Not only did she ignore his request , but adding insult to injury , she tacked on the instruction : shake the souffle to see if it is done . Under his name . Virion was as shaken as his souffle . As the Italian saying goes , to translate is to betray . Chefs are exceedingly difficult to translate because they are imprecise about amounts and , since they are speaking to fellow professionals , they may leave out whole operations . It takes experience and care to give the readers a faithful rendition . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases it would be wiser to say that there is no way to do that dish in America , and just offer the recipe for intellectual enjoyment . Let us glance at The Escoffier Cook Book , which purportsto be a translation of Le Guide Culinaire . It gives no hint of which edition was used and has capricious omissions and some ludicrous errors : entry #1027 , for instance , gives us " English Brandade of Salt Cod . " English brandade ? The good citizens of Nimes would be astonished . The long-awaited American edition of Ali-Bab 's great Gastronomie Pratique ( translated by Elizabeth Benson for McGraw-Hill ) promised to be such a great event that one would like to give it only praise . But the reader is misled as to which edition was used ( it was the ninth ) , whole sections were summarily omitted , and the recipes were ruthlessly culled from more than Iloo to some 530 . No responsibility is taken anywhere for these excisions ? nor is there any admission that they exist . The fact is that some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out lentil soup , oxtail soup , and a giblet soup while retaining the turtle and mock turtle soups seems poor judgment . What were the criteria ? What of the translation itself and the knotty problems of converting rational metric measurements by weight into our higgledy-piggledy system of sixes and sevens ? On a fine metric balance scale , the weight of a cup of flour ( of various types , one French ) hovered between 16o and 1 70 grams . Let us say that one tablespoon weighs io grams . So when Ali-Bab calls for 20 grams of flour for a sauce , it is excessive to translate it as 3 tablespoons ( 30 grams ) , especially since few people level off carefully . Also , a liter is appreciably more in volume than a quart , and this did not always seem to have been taken into consideration . The question may seem niggling , but the difference in the sauces is enormous ; one will be library paste , the other will still be somewhat runny . We are only too aware that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that it is the original author 's preference that should rule . Only one reviewer of this important book wrote as if she had ever even seen the French original , let alone studied it . There is blame enough for everyone . Annemarie 's Cookingschool Cookbook gives a recipe for " Chocolate Mousse Normandy " which she calls a " variation " on a recipe by the late Dione Lucas . Among other changes , Annemarie Huste actually specifies margarineinstead of the original butter ? a whole cupful ? thus murdering the recipe and destroying the already tenuous relationship with Normandy . In the introduction she states , " in any recipe where the taste of butter is unimportant , margarine functions identically . " One is forced to question not only the sensitivity of her palate but the soundness of her observations on the behavior of butter in cooking . In the same book , she gives this recipe for Beef Stock : 2 cans of beef broth ( Campbell 's ) , 1 teaspoon Bovril , water , and aromatics . Making your own stock , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like dish/water . " The use of brand names is always questionable ; only in special circumstances can it be countenanced , yet Annemarie specifies Campbell 's frequently . Very well , French cooking is badly understood in Americaand not well suited to our produce . But how shall we explain a similar mangling of our own heritage ? Just leafing through Thomas Jefferson 's Cook Book , edited by Marie Kimball , one spots the most curious bowdlerizationsand errors . In her introduction , to show how quaint the recipes were , she remarks that a chocolate cream was poured over chicken gizzards . This is remarkably interesting ; evidently gizzards contain rennet just as calf 's stomach lining does . Mrs. Kimball publishes the recipe itself with two junket tablets instead . Clearly , this might have made a useful footnote for modern cooks , but the change in the recipe deprives us of knowing how colonial women coped with such problems as that of rennet . And by implication , we do not know what historical informationis missing from all the other recipes . Mrs. Kimball also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here follow " in December 1784 . Among the items that follow is a " Soup of small roots " with a footnote that reads : " Soup of small roots is attributed to Careme , the great French cook . " Careme did , indeed , give a recipe for similar soup , but , unfortunately , 1784 was the year of Careme 's birth , and his great work on cuisine ( 1833 ) did not appear until some seven years after Jefferson 's death . The fact is that such soups were made in France long before Careme . In The Virginia Housewife ( 1824 ) , Mary Randolph gives this remarkably fine recipeTO DRESS DUCKS WITH JUICE OF ORANGESThe ducks being singed , picked , and drawn , mince the livers with a little scraped bacon , some butter , green onions , sweet herbs and parsley , seasoned withp147salt , pepper , and mushrooms ; these being all minced together , put them into the bodies of the ducks , and roast them , covered with slices of bacon , and wrapped up in paper ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange , a few shallots minced , into a stew pan , and shake in a little pepper ; when the ducks are roasted , take off the bacon , dish them , and pour your sauce with the juice of oranges over them , and serve them up hot . Note : The gravy was natural meat juices and the oranges were the bitter Seville variety . The much admired American Heritage Cookbook ( 1964 ) gives Mrs. Randolph 's duck recipe using the following ingredients : TableThe vinegar and sugar are caramelized , and the parsley is tucked in the tail before serving . Why invoke the name of Mary Randolph in presenting what is actually a banal , overly sweet Caneton a l'Orange ? Where is the duck liver ? Where are the mushrooms and sweet herbs ? Where is the stuffing ? Where are the shallots ? Where , in short , is Mrs. Randolph 's recipe ? A book we were beguiled into buying by an attractive brochure is The Early American Cookbook by Hyla O'Connor . Out of some 280 recipes " gathered from original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attributed , nor is there any **26;1450;TOOLONG . No dates are offered , and only rarely is the region mentioned . O'Connor , a home economist , apparently has never milked a cow . Where a recipe for Buck-Wheat Cakes , which we were able to identify ( from a photograph of the original typography used as decoration ) as having come from Susannah Carter 's The Frugal Housewife ( 1772 ) , calls for " milk-warm water " in the original , she writes " two cups of milk . " She also complains that the mixture is " very bland " and suggests adding 1/a cup molasses . She talks about Washington and Jefferson making ice cream and then proceeds to give us a recipe calling for " 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour " ! Jefferson 's recipe is in his papers ; there is , of course , no flour . Nor does flour seem to have appeared in American ice cream recipes until Fannie Farmer and the home economists . O'Connor gives what turned out to be Simmons ' recipe for Apple Pye from American Cookery ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original directs the reader to use Paste No. 3 , for which O'Connor gives quite a different method and leaves out the egg whites called for . In Miss Simmons ' recipe for A Whipt Syllabub , similarly identified , which calls for cream , white wine , egg whites , and says " sweeten it to your taste , " why did O'Connor add three cups of milk and twentytwotablespoons of sugar ? It makes a sugary , milky froth out of what was an elegant mixture . Be it remarked that none of the reproductions were attributed . Standards of food writing are such that when members of academe try their hand at it they forsake scholarly discipline . A medievalist professor , in a feature story in The New York Times , translates the word melle in a recipe as soften , where it could only mean mix ; the word comes from Old French mesler and the modern meler is so used to this day . ( A common Middle English form is meddle . ) For what she describes as a fifteenth-century blankmangere , she calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup , and one hundred pastry shells ! * In no early English manuscript were we able to find prototypes for some of her recipes . Another professorgives a recipe from The Forme of Cury ( about 1390 ) for " Gourdes in Potage " which instructs : " Take porkFootnotep149so den . Grynde it , and alye it therewith and with yolkes of ayren . " She " modernizes " this recipe by taking ground pork ( apparently raw ) , browning it , and dumping it into the soup ; we never again hear of egg yolk. * ( There is only one possible reading : Take boiled pork . Grind it , and bind it with egg yolks . It is likely that a copyist 's error omitted a direction to form dumplings to be simmeredin the soup ; that is speculation , but it makes sense from a culinary point of view . ) There are so many imponderablesin trying to recapture the taste of medieval food that to change the entire structure of a dish where the language permits no misunderstanding is inadmissible . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some modernization , but changes should be carefully noted and discussed . There is only one way to publish compendiums of recipes from the past , and that is to give each recipe as found ( with bibliographical notes , please ) , followed by any pertinent information or suggestions . In that regard , The Cornucopia by Judith Herman and MargueriteHerman is exemplary . What would be delightful would be to have beautiful facsimile editions of the originals . The difficulty of getting access to old cookbooks and manuscripts is staggering . Often it is prohibitively costly . We can not understand why museums and libraries are not more active in publishingthe treasures that repose in their collections . It would save wear and tear on the originals , make money for the institutions that own them , and make our patrimonyavailable to people who must otherwise depend on the manglers . Even so literate a publication as Natural History has Raymond Sokolov saying that eggplant is " an altogether late arrival in the English-speaking world , " continuing , " Indeed , no European botanist mentions it before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English did not come until 1767 , only 208p150years ago . " John Gerard 's well-known The Herball , published in 1597 , describes eggplant in great detail under the name of Madde Apples . Gerard notes that " This Plant grows in Egypt almost every where . . . " and that it bears fruit " of the bignesse of a Swans egge .... In the dukedomeof Millain it is called Melongena ; and of some , Melanzana : in Latine , Mala insana : and in English , Mad Apples . In the Germane tongue , Dollopffell : in Spanish Verangenes . . . . The people of Toledo eat them with great devotion , being boiled with fat flesh , putting to it some scraped cheese , which they do keep in vinegar , bony , or salt pickle all winter , to procure lust . " Clearly , the Moors brought it to Spain ( Gerard mentions Barbary ) and it seems safe to place this before 1492 . The late Clementine Paddleford , who was food writer for The New York Herald Tribune , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an interview with Horace Sutton of Saturday Review , Claiborne said : " I had been to school in Europe , and I knew all the sauces .... Clem knew not one thing about food . " Well , Claiborne did not then , nor does he now , know all his sauces . As for Clem , whatever her shortcomings , she was a good reporter . Her New England Clam Chowder was authentic ( unlike Claiborne 's ? imagine not using salt pork ! ) and she credited her sources . Also , she liked people and she had a good ear . She quotes , for example , a Dr. Coffin saying , " You must know the history of every lobster you cook . But if you must pick your lobsters at the local market , the only alternative is to get them lively . Cook in Maine sea water . " She goes on to give his recipe for Maine Lobster Stew , one of America 's truly great dishes . She tells also of a Miss Sue , no longer young , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cook everything myself .... I 'm oldfashionedwith my cooking , never use store stuff and I want lard in pie crust and fresh apples . Now Addie here uses all the new ( angles and she has good luck , but I could n't , never will . " Alas , Clem 's ear was better than herp151editor 's taste ; there is no mention of lard in the recipe that follows ? it must have gotten kitchen-tested out by the home economists . The book is now out of print but the publishers have put out a new version ; they changed the name , dropped the attractive regional approach , took out every word of Clem 's wonderful chitchat with the friends she made everywhere . What did they want to do that for ?  |p152The  Gourmet PlagueYes , the French love good eating . . . . Theirskill in combining simple raw materials to produce superlative dishes grows out of theidee fixe that anything eaten , even the dailypotato , humble carrot and turnip and lesstender cuts of meat , must be well prepared . Gourmets are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrequentexcursions to famous restaurants . Good food must be eaten every day , everymeal with each dish carefully prepared andsuitably seasoned . Louis Diat , in French Cooking for Americans IF WE Americans are ever to eat well again , we shall have to declare " gourmet " a dirty word . It started out as a perfectly valid borrowing from the French , a noun meaning " a connoisseur in eating and drinking ; an epicure , " according to Webster . One could , perhaps , defend the attributive use of the word if indeed the attributions had anything to do with epicureanism , but the word is applied indiscriminately to anythingp153edible , or nearly so , that has been fancied up . Gourmet cooking has nothing to do with the excellence of basic materials , the artistry of the cook , or a discriminating palate . Poulet de Bresse , France 's finest chicken , perfectly roasted , would not qualify as gourmet . Nor would an old hen lovingly simmered with onions and carrots . Not fancy enough . But take the breast of an American chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cottony bird ) , blanket it with a pasty white sauce ( calling it veloute makes it so very French , n'est-ce pas ? ) , arrange it prettily on a bed of spinach ( frozen , chopped , and bound with that same horrid sauce ? you may now call it a la Florentine ) , strew slivered almonds or grated cheese about , glaze it , and you have a gourmet masterpiece . Or stuff it with rice , foie gras , and truffles . The foie gras and truffles will surely be canned and of poor quality , but they make everything look fancy and terribly expensive , which is finally the name of the game . It is then sauced with pretty much the same old floury glop , but now it is called Espagnole , is a muddy brown , and will taste of tomato paste , mediocre Madeira , and canned bouillon . A recipe given by Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey is for a veloute to be served on fish fillets . It calls for 8 ( yes , eight ) tablespoons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added to one cup of pan juices and one cup of heavy cream . The reduction of those juices with the cream would have made a heavenly sauce ; adding two cups of library paste made it a catastrophe . Claiborne 's recipe for another fish veloute in The New York Times Cook Book calls for 24 ( twenty-four ) tablespoonsof flour to five cups of stock , which may be a gourmet record . ( It is very nearly 5 tablespoons per cup of liquid . ) Claiborne claims to know his Escoffier inside out . In his Guide Culinaire , the great chef notes at the very beginning :  |p154The  fonds de cuisine stocks represent the basis , the most necessary elements , without which nothing seriouscould be undertaken . .. . The most skillful worker can not create something from nothing ; and it would be most unrealistic to insist that he present a work done according to the rules of the art if he has been furnished with only defective produce . Escoffier goes on to say that it would be just as absurd to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottling , be transformed into a great wine . " Yet , this is exactly what gourmet cookbooks would have you do . Pick up any writing on French cooking for Americans ? Julia Child , Simone Beck , Beard , Jacques Pepin , Claiborne ? and you will find canned bouillon listed among the ingredients . Among those who write in English on French cooking , only Elizabeth David and Richard Olney , to our knowledge , remain true to the most elementary flavor principles in this respect . Anyone who writes recipes is sadly aware that many readers will substitute canned stock , but the readers should know that they are cheating and so understandwhere the dish failed . It has been said that Campbell 's soups have done more to debase the cooking of Americans ? and their palates ? than any other single factor . Women simply do not make soups anymore , and the stock pot has disappeared . Only a few old cranks seem to appreciate the difference that a well-made stock makes in a sauce. " ... at one time , a badge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , today the can opener is fast becoming a magic wand . " The writer is Poppy Cannon in The Can-Opener Cook Book ( 1951 ) . She was one of the early gourmet writers , and her frank espousal of canned soups had incalculable influence on that movement : her enthusiasm and her position in the world of fashion gave the tin can a cachet that it would otherwise not have had . " Armed with a can opener , I become the artist-cook , the master , the creative chef .... It is easy to cook like a gourmet though you are a beginner . We wantp155you to believe just as we do that in this miraculous age it is quite possible ? and it 's fun ? to be a chef ' even before you can really cook . " Something must be said about the extravagance of gourmet cooking . We are not now referring to fresh butter , heavy cream , or other beautiful produce ; in our society , such things are expensive when available at all . We are referring to the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated by caviar , truffles , foie gras , chicken breasts , and filet mignon were always absurd ; they became downright offensive when inflation and recession struck the country . One trouble is that Americans have forgotten how to be poor . Not that hard times ever were fun , but people coped better . In fact , the history of cookery is largely the triumph of housewives making do with what the gentry would n't touch . Eating high on the hog meant eating the fancy marketable cuts ; the poor would get the jowl , the chitterlings , the feet , the tail , and with them would make fine food . All the great tripe , snail , and sausage dishes are their inventions , and all the chowders . What is bouillabaisse but a chowder that Marseilles women made of the trash fish that their husbands could n't sell ? ( Now the gourmet cooks add lobster to it , which does nothing for the lobster and nothing for the bouillabaisse . ) Most of the fish , the hog , and the steer now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the cheap parts if they had them . During the 1973 beef famine , reporters sought to learn how people were coping . Most were like this young couple at a supermarket : the husband was unemployed , the wife pregnant , and their cart held a sack of candy bars , a TV dinner , and a coconut pie . " You 've got to treat yourselves once in a while , " the husband explained . As for middle-class women , most admitted that they had no idea what to do , but some thought they were being pretty smart by leaning hard on " casseroles . " " Lots ofp156macaroni and cheese ' is the battle plan of a New Orleans housewife , " said a Times roundup . " I 've gotten down to basics . ' " Another housewife , of Brooklyn , boasted , " I put in everything I can think of , peas , beans , scraps of meat left over . " In Missoula , Montana , a member of the League of Women Voters made a discovery : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat as usual in a casserole and double the other ingredients , it will go for two meals . " When Claiborne and his partner , Franey , returned to The Times in early 1974 , they marked the occasion with a feature describing a dinner for eight that would cost $900 , cooked at home . ( A reader commented , " It 's the dawn of an old era . " ) The menu called for caviar with vodka , striped bass fillets with champagne sauce , stuffed squab Derby , braised endives , salad , Brie cheese , and grapefruit sherbet . The wines were a Montrachet , a Chateau Ausone , a Romanee-Conti , and a Dom Perignon . Claiborne and Franey allowed that if the caviar and the wines were deleted , the cost " might deflate to around $9o . " It is a revealing comment , for the wines had been chosen as pretty much the highest priced in each class , and there was no suggestion that a reader might drink a very enjoyable wine at much lower cost . At that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that floury veloute described earlier ; the foie gras and the truffles in the squabs were canned and hence a pointless extravagance ; instead of the classic demi-glace , the sauce for the squab included tomato paste and flour , and there was sugar in the braised endives . Faced with this basic menu , it would have been better to reduce the fish juices with heavy cream , as described earlier , and simply to roast the squab , deglazing the lovely pan juices with a little Madeira and very well reduced homemade veal broth , and to serve it on a crunchy rotie ( toast ) . There are more elaborate ways of dealing with the bird , to be sure , but none that show off the natural flavor of pigeon as well.  |p157The  menu was Claiborne 's and Franey 's answer to the question : " What would you command if you were allowedone last great meal on this earth ? " It " is a game we have played with many chefs throughout the world , " Claiborne recounts in his new book , Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " how many chefs say for their last great feast they would like things on the order of tripe a la mode de Caen , cassoulet , and breaded pig 's feet ? real peasant fare . P.S. To tell you the truth , we would willingly settle for a pound of fresh caviar and fresh buttered toast . " This explains , perhaps , how he is able to say : " We find pork ... almost as appealingas caviar . " JUST A QUIET DINNERFOR TWO IN PARIS31 DISHES , NINE WINES , A $4,000 CHECK ? Headline , page z , The New York Times , November 14 , 1975The diners were Claiborne and Franey . Claiborne had made the high bid on a dinner for two , offered by AmericanExpress , at a charity auction . They had considered " nothing but vodka or champagne with caviar followed by foie Bras with Chateau d'Yquem ? but no , any old millionaire could do that . " That would not do , so they ordered twenty-nine more dishes and seven more wines . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Horne wrote : " ... no journalistic caprice has , in my memory , set off such a shudder of distaste .... This calculated evening of high-class piggery offends an average American 's sense of decency . It seems wrong , morally , esthetically and in every other way . " ( Emphasis hers . ) The Vatican newspaper deplored the display while millions were starving ; the French press noted that the pricep158of the dinner represented a year 's wages for many workers . ( A roundup of world opinion , slated for the following day in The Times , was killed . ) " I never heard of anything so vulgar , " a woman said to Van Horne . Few people seemed to realize that it was also ignorant . Denis , of Chez Denis where all this took place , had tactfully tried to tell our ambassadors of good will that there would be enough food for ten ; that " it was not required that all foods be sampled . " The sumptuousmenus of the nineteenth century were served a la Francaise ; more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner chose what tempted him from each service or , more likely , what was nearest . Only gluttons would eat three soups ; Claiborne found the third one " anticlimactic . " " The foods were elegant to look at , but the over-all display was undistinguished , if not to say shabby . " Claibornehad other complaints : " ... but the beurre blanc should have been very hot . " As we discuss elsewhere , a beurre blanc is butter whipped into a reduction of shallots and white wine vinegar ; it is an exceedingly fragile liaison and it takes a flair to make it fluffy . If it had been " very hot , " it would no longer have been a beurre blanc . Van Horne also wrote : " Claiborne has sinned against certain canons some of his colleagues in the press prefer to honor . What I am trying to say , as politely as possible , is that I do not like the jiggery-pokery by which this $4,000 dinner check was paid . " There was a storm of protest , and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked readers . Claiborne , in his reply , regretted that many had found the dinner " obscene or decadent or a symbol of contempt for the hunger that exists in the world today . " He went on to ask " those who were not amused if they seriously believe that as a result of that evening I have deprived one human being of one mouthful of food . "  |p159This  may answer Van Horne 's question : " Was there no remorse between the foie gras and the cafe filtre ? " Edunt et vomant . Doubtless responding to published criticism , the ClaiborneFraneyteam wrote , " So-called gourmet cooking does not of necessity imply truffles and foie gras . Any dish that is soaringly good to the senses ... can fall into the sublime category . " The prose is Claiborne , but the solution is Howard Johnson 's : two gourmet meat loaf dishes . One calls for 2 pounds of ground veal and % pound of mushrooms , served with something called Sauce Alexandre , a floury veloute with ' /z pound of mushrooms added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 pounds of them , with a cup of chopped watercress . This is also sauced with a veloute to which chopped watercress is added , thus making the same culinary error as before , that of repeating the characterizing ingredient in both dish and sauce . It is wrong in taste , texture , and color , and violates every principle of saucing . Neither of these dishes is cheap ? each calls for at least 1 ' /2 cups heavy cream , for instance ? and yet both manage to be hopelesslybanal . In another piece , Claiborne and Franey lead off : " While there is something excruciatingly mundane about dishes made with ground meat and noodles or macaroni ( could it have something to do with their low-budget connotations ? ) , they can also be outrageously good . " ( The parenthetical remark is theirs . ) We are then treated to two recipes , Beef with noodles casserole and Macaroni and beef casserole . There is more difference in the titles than in the recipes ; each calls for butter , onion , green pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheddar cheese . One calls for ground round steak and noodles and the other for chopped ground chuck ( sic ) or round steak and macaroni . The recipes may well have come from Howard Johnson 's ; this is gourmet on the cheap.  |p160There  are not many Claiborne features in which one can not find one or more unfortunate errors . A recipe for Potee Bourguignonne calls for a chicken , stuffed with Italian sausages ( ! ) , and fresh pork ( a potee is not a potee without corned pork ) . Burgundians would be surprised to find a chicken in their potee . ( The dish , as presented , is a flattened-out version of poule au pot d'Henri IV from the Beam . ) Claiborne and Franey give a recipe for Alsatian pastry that calls for " well-chilled corn oil " and milk . Never have we seen such a recipe for pastry except , perhaps , on a Mazola label ; certainly never in Alsace . Proper Alsatian pastry recipes call for butter and lard , not unlike the Danish recipes one of us grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor and lard for tenderness . ) Some cooks add egg yolks as well . But corn oil ? Nicht . Another Claiborne anomaly is his recipe for Flageolets , Bretonne Style in The New York Times Cook Book . A flageolet is a bean grown around Arpajon and dried in the shade in such a way that it retains its green color and even a memory of the taste of the fresh bean . For rustic bean dishes , the earthy taste and texture of other beans make a far better choice ; the elusive flavor of flageolets is easily masked , and every effort should be made to enhance it . But they are imported and expensive ; hence gourmet . Let us see what Claiborne does with them . First , he boils them up with " 5 or 6 cloves . " Poor little flageolets . Next , he dumps them into a sauce which he apparently considers to be Sauce Bretonne , which consists of 2 tablespoons butter , a chopped onion ( cooked until brown ) , cup tomato puree , 4 tomatoes , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It reads like a recipe from a second-rate spaghetti joint . All that tomato , all that garlic , and the browning of the onions ( not forgetting the 5 or 6 cloves ) would effectively mask anything , even rank meat . The flageolets never had a chance . It is interesting to note that Escoffier gives no recipep161for flageolets a la Bretonne , considering them , perhaps , too delicate for this robust sauce . His recipe for Haricots blancs a la Bretonne calls for cooking white beans with the " ordinary aromatics " ; no cloves are mentioned . The sauce proper starts with onion cooked in butter to a " blond color " only , is then moistened with I cup white wine , reduced by half ; I1/2 cups each of Espagnole and tomato sauce and " one small clove of garlic " are then added . Overseasoning , let us note again , is an American neurosisthat we attribute largely to the improverishment of our foods . This is not a view widespread in the foodwriting game . Raymond Sokolov , writing in Natural History magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child of Mastering the Art of French Cooking . Mme. Beck , he says , " told me that it was from Mrs. Child that her palate learned to appreciate the slightly higher level of seasoning prevalent in America . Is the famous delicacy ' of French food partly due to the cultural caution of French cooks with salt ? " Or could it be that our palates are simply numbed ? Sokolov writes : " If I really follow my own taste ' in salting food , I ruin dinner for most people , except for NaCl true believerslike myself . " Elsewhere , he says that for him , " fiery jalapeno peppers ... were a test of manhood . " Ole ! In a New York Times Magazine article entitled " Burnt Flavor at the Box Tree , " praising an expensive new restaurant , Sokolov explains the special character of its sauces : " plenty of Cognac goes into his brown sauces " and they are based on a stock made from " burned scraps of filet and burned celery chunks . The burning ? not browning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is meant to remind the customer subliminally of a charcoal-broiled steak .... " Similarly , his book , The Saucier'sApprentice , states : " Good brown roux will look almost the same color as chocolate . " Flour and butterp162cooked to the color of chocolate will be scorched and will communicate an acrid taste to the sauce . The introduction to Claiborne 's Kitchen Primer says : " The basis of most French cooking is butter and cream ; they are called for unstintingly here and without apology . As far as I am concerned , there are no substitutes . " Openingthe book at random , we find " A Good Plain Yellow Cake " that calls for " 8 tablespoons ( 1/2 cup ) solid , white vegetable shortening . " The sugar cookies that follow call for the same thing . " Pie Pastry " calls for " 1/2 cup solid or nonliquid shortening ( this may be part butter ) . " Claiborne 's version of mayonnaise , unlike the classic , contains mustard , and he prefers peanut or salad oil to olive oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... to me , nothing can replace the flavour and aroma of a genuine , mildly fruity olive oil ... so it should be said that a great many people ... prefer to use groundnutpeanut oil not only because of its cheapness but because they are not accustomed to the flavour of olive oil . Groundnut oil makes quite passable mayonnaise and could certainly be used for practicing but as it is absolutely devoid of taste , it is necessary to add flavour in the form of a little extra lemon juice and perhaps mustard . " For our part , any calories we eat have got to be delicious , and nothing but the best Provencal or Lucca oil goes into our salads . A notice in Claiborne 's Primer : IMPORTANT ! READ THIS : A white sauce is nothing short of miraculous for there is literally no end to its uses and variations . The same old library paste , ad nauseam . Claiborne announces that milk and cream " freeze well . " But do they thaw well ? They do not . Frozen cream " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . Theyp163can still be used in some cooking , however . As noted , there is a page and a half on how to make coffee but not one word on quality , the importance of fresh roasting , or the desirability of grinding it at home . On paring vegetables : " Then lay out a length of waxed paper , or newspaperif you want to be economical , to catch the peelings . " Condescension to the economically minded aside , any housewife knows that newspaper is ever so much more capacious and efficient , because of its absorbency . A rather more interesting kitchen hint was given by Claiborne in the staid old Times : " We were enchanted to learn that we share an enthusiasm of long standing with Mrs. B. When nobody else is around , she likes to streak in the kitchen , except when she 's deep fat frying . Then she wears an apron . " Not so charming is Claiborne 's advice on cooking with wine . An article of his that appeared in The Washington Post opens : " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ) have wild conceptions about the technique of cooking with wine . " Some innocents are less young . Farther on , he says , " And heaven help the guest who dines on a dish to which a cup of such wine uncooked has been added just before serving . If the wine is not cooked , it maintains its raw taste and is apt to lead to acute indigestion . " Now , wine is used in cooking , but not to make it digestible . The long , slow simmering of meat with wine and aromatics transfigures the dish and is , indeed , the very soul of French cooking . However , it would not be out of place here to cite Escoffier : " We counsel that any wine which is destined to give to a sauce its characteristic note should be always added hors du feu off the fire because boiling evaporates the aroma of the wine . " This is almost invariable with fortified wines such as Madeira , but it is also done with table wines . We know one great chef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red wine , beef stock , shallots , and aromatics ) a glug of good red wine just before the " finishing " with butter ? to freshen the taste , as he de/scribes it . Also , the people of the Southwest of France have for centuries been putting uncooked wine into their soup bowls ? a custom known as faire chabrol ? with no ill effect . Indeed , most of us who drink wine drink it uncooked . For the gourmet cook , sloshing about quantities of wine and brandy is pretty much de rigueur . The wine is usually poor and the quantity of brandy invariably excessive . ( " Cooking wine " is an abomination . An old motto in our kitchen is that there are wines that one might possibly drink that are not good enough for cooking . ) To cook a great wine is a pointless extravagance , but tag ends of stale wine usually work out well , provided that they were pleasant to drink in the first place . The taste is all that is left when the alcohol is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the gourmets slosh it on so . One of Claiborne 's recipes doused a pound of scallops , which have a subtle , almost elusive flavor , with ? cup of cognac , two cups of tomatoes , and paprika . Flambeeing is the pinnacle of gourmet cooking . We once asked Mere Allard , Burgundian and great cuisiniere ( now retired ) of the Paris bistro that bears her name , about the practice of flambeeing boeuf bourguignon . She made a moue and said , " Burnt alcohol tastes like burnt alcohol . " A headwaiter in New York is credited with the comment , " The customers like it , and it does n't hurt the food much . " When they are not putting the wrong thing into a dish , the gourmets are likely to be taking the wrong thing out . In Sokolov 's Great Recipes from The New York Times , pork chops are baked in 1 1/2 cups of wine and 3/4 cup of chicken broth . The last step reads : " When chops are done , remove from oven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There went most of the flavor , down the drain . Other Times recipes have instructed us to discard pan juices from cooking fish . Fresh pork rind , an item in/dispensable in many dishes ? daube or cassoulet , for instance ? whichis not only rather expensive but usually requires a small safari to foreign butcher shops when needed , was likewise consigned to the garbage pail . ( Fresh pork rind may be rolled up and frozen against the time of use . It must not be kept too long and should be quickly parboiled before using . ) Now , French women are often accused of setting an extravagant table , and perhaps they do , but there is more than a touch of frugality in their madness . No carcass of a bird , no fish heads or bones , no good meat bones get thrown out . It is not only thrifty to boil them up into lovely fumets and broths , but it yields flavor and texture that can not be obtained in any other way . Since flavor is precisely what is most lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the greater part of America 's gourmet cuisine is at best second-rate Escoffier . We are too kind . Escoffierwas a dazzling virtuoso and he had produce of a quality such as we can only dream of today . It is frequentlysaid that French haute cuisine was invented to mask rank produce . The truth is that everyone who had enough to eat had beautiful produce , and haute cuisine was invented to dazzle the aristocracy and to mark the difference of class . Lower down the ranks , people had to content themselves with the lowlier cuts that were despisedby the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie alike , and this is where the fabled dishes of France originated : the tripe dishes , the cassoulet , the potee , the daube , etc . But these lowly cuts of meat and vegetables and aromatics that went into them were of beautiful quality . Take le bouillabaisse , le cotriade , or la chaudree ; they were made of trash fish and whatever else was not sold from the day 's catch , but the fish were leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . On the contrary , it is today 's produce that needs masking . With modern refrigeration , food never seemsp166to go quite rotten ; it just tastes embalmed . Sadly , no amount of masking , and no matter how skillfully done , takes away that embalmed taste . Interestingly , the young chefs in France , at least the gifted ones , are turning away from Escoffier . He himself changed his methods and refined his cuisine during his long career . It is instructive to compare his Guide Culinaire ( 1902 ) with Ma Cuisine ( 1934 ) . In the latter work , he used considerably less flour in his classic sauces ( about two teaspoons per cup of finished sauce ) , removed the tomato from his Espagnole ( an important point that has gone unremarked ) , deleted flour from his tomatosaucerecipe , and included many dishes from his native Provencal . Indeed , la nouvelle cuisine , if we leave aside dietetic cooking , certain exotica , and the public-relations aspect of it all , is essentially a return to a much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coulis , and the liaison of sauces with butter , egg yolks , or cream instead of cheap thickeners such as flour and other starches . The flavors are at once more intense and more subtle . The effect is reminiscent of the lovely eighteenth-century dishes in the anonymous Cuisinier Gascon and Menon 's La Cuisiniere Bourgeoise . There is indeed a great deal of simplification going on today in French cuisine , but not the kind that requires less skill or lesser quality of produce . Quite the contrary . There is no masking possible , and the sauces are far more fragile . Flour-based sauces may be a horrible necessity in huge kitchens ? they are much cheaper and they are virtually indestructible , even with long waits in hot kitchens ? but there is little excuse for them in small chef-patron restaurants and even less in private homes . Part and parcel of this new French haute cuisine is the feverish search for quality produce . French agriculture , too , is hard hit by industrialization , but it is at least two generations behind us . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are remarkably adept in arranging things sop167that they will be able to do so . It is amusing to note that while fancying up food is a symptom of is now the less affluent who feel they have to paint the lily . While one must deplore snobbery wherever it appears , it does n't take much intelligence or even a very discriminating palate to prefer simple perfection to pretentious failure . Now , how did we come to preferring pretentious failures ? We were taken , that 's how . It must be added that we were easy marks . Oddly , one reason is our addiction to shortcuts and our contempt for arduously acquired craftsmanship . ' We have matured a bit since the days when con artists could promise that we could learn to play the piano in ten easy lessons ? " They laughed when I sat down to play " ? and most literate Americans are aware that painting-in the numbered squares is not the path to creation of art . But one typical cooking school offers to make you a gourmet chef in a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the emergency is not specified . Marriage ? ) Our sophistication does not yet include food . We must have every ingredient measured to the last 1/8 teaspoon , and we cook by painting-in the numbered squares . When the authors were asked to supply a fish recipe to accompanya feature on the pending demise of the Fulton Fish Market , we submitted the best and simplest recipe we know : There is a Provencal saying to the effect that a fish swims in water but dies in oil ; olive oil , it goes without saying . This means that the fish must be flapping fresh . Coat the fish with good olive oil ; lay it on a well oiled piece of foil or cooking parchment ; salt and pepper it , inside and out ; sprinkle with fresh lemon juice ; close the foil tight and bake it in a hot oven until barely done . Fish must still be translucent along the backbone . Thyme or Italian parsley may be lightly strewn about and a sliced onion or two ,  |p168lightly  sauteed in olive oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editors . " How much olive oil ? " We replied , " How big is the fish ? " Not getting through , we dropped the recipe . Thereafter , recipes were incorporated in our text in such a way as to bypass the editors . One does not become a chef , at least not in France , before spending three long years as an apprentice , followed by three or four equally hard years as a journeyman ( commis , then chef de parti ) . This helps to explain why most books and schools promising to turn you into a French chef are frauds . An American who is confronted with produce of lamentable quality , who has little or no experience , whose kitchen equipment has been chosen for decor rather than utility , and who has no staff of assistants , can hardly hope to produce haute cuisine . More serious , perhaps , is the fact that we have become downright neurotic about food . Is it polyunsaturated ? How many calories ? ( Nevertheless , we continue to dose everything up with sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , horror of horrors , is it out ? How much is a pinch of salt ? Goodness knows there is plenty to be frightened about , what with residual insecticides , hormones , antibiotics , the additives and the subtractatives . These have been exposed by a handful of latter-day Rachel Carsons . But meanwhile , the taste and texture of our produce have deteriorated to the level of a cruel and monstrous joke . Take the tomato , or the chicken , or bread , or ... This has aroused some disorganized resistance , but not from the gourmet experts . Julia Child et al. , in Mastering the Art of French Cooking , announce that " the book could well be titled French Cooking from the American Supermarket , ' for the excellence of French cooking , and of good cooking in general , is due more to cooking techniques than to anything else . " Escoffier starts his works discussing the quality of the produce for his fonds de cuisine ; for the French , this is primordial . A womanp169giving a recipe will say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine chicken , nice and plump ) , and you can just see her patting a chicken appreciatively . Americanwomen used to be equally concerned ; we have quoted elsewhere the dictum of Amelia Simmons ( 1796 ) but it bears repeating : We proceed to ROOTS and VEGETABLES ? and the bestcook can not alter the first quality , they must be good , or the cook will be disappointed . An admonition that Mrs. Child would do well to heed . In her recent book , From Julia Child 's Kitchen , we find that she is still in the supermarket : The other day my supermarket had some gorgeous z-inch squares of well-trimmed , nicely marbled meat all beautifully packaged in see-through containers . A big red extra label ... announced loudly : Barbecue . Brochettes .... I grabbed up a package , rushed home , skewered it , basted it , broiled it , and was it ever tough ! Blind faith in my market had made me careless . All is technique , Mrs. Child said in Mastering the Art of French Cooking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tells us : " ... gather a modest variety of canned fruits , boil them a few minutes in their own syrup with strips of lemon peel and a stick of cinnamon ; then while their syrup is boiling down to a glaze , you arrange the fruits beautifully in a serving dish , interspersingthem , perhaps , with thinly sliced bananas and a sprinkling of sliced almonds ( always on hand in your freezer for such occasions ) . When you spoon the glaze over the fruits , you have a lovely looking dessert that , also , has a certain sophistication of taste . " She calls for " Enough ready-mix for two 9-inch pies " in one recipe and she announces that " frozen store-bought ready-made shells " are to be part of her show on quiches . She sits in her " little house near Grasse " pining , " ... if I could justp170get the chicken breasts the way I could get them in the U.S. " Bless her . Grasse is a hop , skip , and a jump from Sisteron , whence come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfumed with the wild thyme on which the animals graze . It is sold in no American supermarket . How many of our leading writers and gourmets have criticized our virtually inedible American chicken ? We can recall only Simone Beck , and she showed remarkable restraint . When we criticized " sterilized " cream ? the cream that keeps virtually indefinitely and has an odd taste that can best be described as having been boiled to death ? we got a sniffy note from a Family Circle food editor saying it " reacts and tastes exactly as the regular . " And she tells us how to cook . When an American creme fral the appeared on the market some time ago , the gourmetpress went gaga . It sells at astronomical prices and in no way could be mistaken for creme fra " zche ; it has an unpleasant off taste and a curiously waxy texture . What we need is not fancy gourmet items but simple , beautiful , old-fashioned double cream ; the kind that FannieFarmer back in 1896 explained had to be diluted half and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy cream today has less character than the cream we used to take off the top of the milk bottle not so many years ago . It tasted better , too . ( The coffee " lighteners " can not be described in polite society . ) Dr. Paul A. Fine , in the study of our eating patterns discussed in the first chapter , described the movement from immigrant and rural communities into the mainstreamof American life , which is characterized by a diet of Oreos , Crisco , TV dinners , macaroni and cheese , Pepsi and Coke , pizza , Jell-O , Heinz ketchup , and instant coffee . Dr. Fine goes on to discuss those who break out of the mainstream ? those " upwardly-mobile , educated , self-reliant people who are usually at least one generation removed from their ethnic origins . " Here one finds the gourmets , the experimenters , the consumerists.  |p171Dr  . Fine says that " Quality consciousness lies both to the right and left ; mainstream eaters tend to use commercial products as their standard of quality ? that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good soup rather than homemade soup . " Where Dr. Fine errs is in assuming that the gourmets do not use Campbell 's soups . Convenience foods have so debased the American palate that even those who would describe themselves as gourmets ? and this includes food writers and teachers ? use canned soups regularly . The grotesqueness of doing gourmet cooking using canned soup seems to strike very few people . What is tragic is that it is precisely the taste-makers who are the easiest marks for gourmet cooking . Many of them are honestly interested in ethnic cuisines ? often that of their own ancestry from which they had been alienated ? but are led astray by what Dr. Fine calls " flattened out " versions . The commonest of these are spaghetti , pizza , Tex-Mex dishes , and so on . French country cooking fares no better . Dr. Fine noted that women no longer grew up learningto cook and had to learn from schools and books . Actually , this has been increasingly true for most of a century , and accounts in large part for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to cook at her mother 's side . Such women do not feel the need to make gourmet concoctions ? they are secure in the knowledge that the food they cook is delicious and that it has pleased countless generations . Interestingly , the only really good cooks we know in this country ( American-born ) were somehow spared the mainstream homogenizing process . They have not lost touch with their past . They have inherited a cuisine that came to them from women who had to do farm chores , help in the fields and care for large families with no labor-saving devices , not even running water . They had no more time to do fancy cooking than the modern liberated woman , but they coped better . We too would cope better if we learned the cuisine of our grandmothers , whether it be Boston Baked Beans or a French daube . They are dishes that simmer away for hours on end but mind themselves perfectly and actually improve on reheating . It 's a cinch with modern stoves ? grandmother managed with a wood-burning stove or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no complicatedtechniques to learn . All that is required is decent produce and the willingness to learn the construction of a few of those old-fashioned dishes so that one can do them without agonizing over measurements . Finally , however , regional cuisine is based on the produce available , and French cuisine in America must be something of a compromise . We would like to see a revival of genuine American cooking . Traces still persist , but fewer and fewer cooks make Maine Lobster Stew , or the chowders , the gumbos , the crab cakes , the baked beans , the oyster loaves , and other great dishes of our past . The fascinating Portuguese strain in New England cookery indicates that we can assimilate a good deal of ethnic cooking without losing our essential character . We admire French cuisine , but we have failed to learn its most important lesson , so well stated by the great French gastronome Curnonsky : " Cuisine is when food tastes of what it is. "  |p173Vive  la DifferenceWomen lack the instincts for great cooking .... They have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notinnovators . Chef Paul Bocuse , to Craig Claiborne , The New York Times , June 30 , 197S WHO DOES Paul Bocuse think invented cooking ? Reporting this old canard in his inimitable style , Claiborne described Bocuse as the King of Chefs and " heavily macho and with a high profile sex image . " The meaning was pretty clear , but Newsweek spelled it out , saying that the chef " routinely expresses contempt for women in the kitchen . The only place for them is in bed , ' says Bocuse , adding that anyone who does n't change his woman every week or so lacks imagination . ' " Well , that is what women are for , is n't it ? ? that , and the drudgery of housework ? When it comes to creativity , leave it to the men . This is not sex , it is a rape of women 's talents . That a woman should say much the same thing about women and their cooking is incredible . Yet none other than Julia Child is quoted by Nancy L. Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't knowp174a damn thing about French cooking , although they pretend they know everything . " Among the French women who hobnob with American Embassy wives such as Mrs. Child , this may be true ; among the French women we know , there are magnificent cooks . She told John Kifner of The Times that her new book , From Julia Child 's Kitchen , was for " people whose hobby is food , not for housewives . " Kifner explained , " The word housewives , ' in her vocabulary , ranks with home economists ' as a term to be disdained . " It seems that the term cook is also to be disdained ; she calls herself The French Chef although she is neither French nor chef . Trouble is , most American food writers do n't know the difference between a chef and a cook . Jovan Trboyevic , owner of Le Perroquet in Chicago , told us not long ago : " There are great cooks who will never be chefs and chefs who will never be cooks . A chef is an executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table of ten people ten different meals , all dishes arriving on time ? a stunt that is brilliant , antigastronomic , and demented . In fact , he is a glorified short-order cook . If the chef is a gifted cook , you will dine well ; if he has a touch of genius , you will dine memorably . But how often does that happen ? It should be explained that the title of chef is earned only after three long , hard years as an apprentice , followed by another three or four long , hard years as a journeyman . It is not a title you pick up at the local Cordon Bleu cooking school . Mimi Sheraton , who studied at the Cordon Bleu in Paris , has this to say : " That was utter baloney . The chef used red and black food coloringin everything , and everybody cheated on the exam ? the chef told us what to do so he would n't look bad . " ( New York , November 18 , 1974 ) Le grand restaurant evolved after the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find new masters . Thus , any man with the price couldp175be a prince for the evening , complete with an obsequious retinue in livery . The occupation of chefs became epater les bourgeois ? to knock their eyes out . It seemed necessary , because the clients had cuisinieres at home who were fine cooks . Balzac said , " One does not dine as luxuriously in the provinces as in Paris , but one dines better ; the dishes are better thought out . In the far reaches of the provinces there are Caremes in petticoats , unknown geniuses who know how to make a dish of beans worthy of the nod with which Rossini acknowledges a perfectly successful dish . " Rossini , so the story goes , was so enamored of the cooking of his cuisiniere that when she threatened to quit , he married her . This theme was repeated in art form by Marcel Rouff in La Vie et la Passion de Dodin-Bouffant . Dodin is invitedby a prince to dine and is treated to a royal feast of some fifty dishes , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of servants . Dodin reciprocates with a dinner where Adele , his cuisiniere , prepares and serves a one-dish meal , the lowly pot-au-feu , but such a pot-au-feu that the prince tries to steal her away . WhereuponDodin marries the woman . The entire book is an homage to la cuisine de femme , la vraie cuisine de France , with mouth-watering description of scores of dishes that Rouff attributes to Adele , la cuisiniere . Leo Larguier , in Clarisse , ou la vieille cuisiniere , says that women cooks " are naturally delicate , and gastronomes by profession would do well to study them more . " He goes on to repeat a story told by Theodore de Banville wherein Sophie , the cuisiniere , has prepared a dinner suitable for a proper bourgeois house but the master , following his nose , comes to the kitchen , and lifts a lid from a casserole . " It is one of those dishes that the artist makes for herself and never for her master , a ragout of mutton , but ideal , tawny , golden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glistened like topazes . " Bref , he devours the ragout and licks the pot clean . The terriblep176Sophie returns : " Do n't come in here again . Me , I do n't eat your slop ! " Robert J. Courtine , France 's most prestigious food writer , talked about these differences at lunch a few years ago , waving a fork above his Lorraine potee , a hearty dish of cabbage and pork . " Cooking is naturally feminine , " he said , " but when it becomes art , it is masculine . Genius apart , I prefer women 's cooking . Thank God there is not too much genius around . Otherwise , you could not eat a potee . A great chef would put something in it ? I do n't know , caviar ? ? and it would work . But if he 's not a genius ... Well , I remember a well-known chef presenting a dish of crepes filled with ham and creme fra " ache , rolled in bechamel , gratinees , and flambees . " Courtine grimaced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman cooks for love of her man , a chef for himself , for his pride . The genius of simplicity is the genius of woman , the genius of complexity is the genius of man . " Courtine regarded the late Alexandre Dumaine as one of the greatest of chefs . Significantly , it was not one of the elaborate dishes he was celebrated for that Courtine recalled , but a simple dish of veal sweetbreads with freshpickedspinach . " Dumaine just stirred the spinach in the pot with a wooden fork on which he had impaled a clove of garlic . That was a woman 's trick . " A similar dish of Dumaine 's sweetbreads , with fresh garden peas , was a golden memory to the late Madeleine Decure , editor of Revue de Cuisine et Vins de France . Reminiscing , she said : " I told Dumaine that that dish recaptured the taste of the sweetbreads my mother used to make . " Was he pleased ? She looked surprised at the question . " Well , I should hope so . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother because she made la bonne soupe . ' And she did . " Miss Decure , a fine cook of impeccable taste , had nothing but scorn tempered with pity for women who attempted to dazzle guests with cooking for which they were not trained . " Snobs , " she said . " Les pauvres. "  |p177It  is interesting to note that women 's cooking in France is precisely the hearty food that men like . Unlike their misguided American sisters , they leave to chefs the confectionof baubles to tempt jaded palates . La potee , la daube , la garbure , le cassoulet , le navarin , le pot-au-f euallthese stews and bean dishes are women 's cooking . And when chefs cook for themselves or wish to please an old friend , they cook these homey dishes . Escoffier often said he preferred his wife 's cooking to his own . When we shared a lapin a la moutarde with the late Pere Troisgros , he explained , " This is not a restaurant dish ; it is a dish for the patron and his friends . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chatting with the earnest young patron , Claude l'cyrot , generally regarded as the most brilliant chef in Paris . " You liked that ? " he asked . " Ah , you should have known my mother 's cooking . " He got that dreamy look that a Frenchman gets when he talks about his mother 's cooking , and he launched into a description of how she would get from the clapier a rabbit " nourished on the good grass of our country " and lovingly simmer it with the wine and herbs of the region , the Vivarois . " That was cooking , " he said . " Ah , I lived in a time that will never return . " That American gourmets should insult women 's cookingis not especially new , but one would have expected Paul Bocuse of Lyons to be more loyal to his own tradition . For centuries , Lyons has been regarded as the gastronomiccapital of France , and that reputation was largely created by les meres saintes . These legendary cuisinieres first cooked for the silk merchants of Lyons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened restaurantswhere they served the same food they had cooked for les bourgeois . Many of them became famous . Gradually , the old cooks retired and were replaced by chefs , but until a few years ago , Mere Brazier , then in her seventies , was still presiding over the kitchen of one of the twelve top-rated restaurants in France . The tradition lingers inp178the names of the restaurants ( Mere Brazier , Mere Guy , Mere Charles , Tante Alice , Chez Juliette ) and in theirmenus : quenelles , saucisson en brioche , volaille demi-deuil , poulet au vinaigre . The cuisinieres formed the taste of the Lyonnais . Their men were connoisseurs because they ate well at home , and they insisted on eating well when they dined out . There is this sort of chemical interaction between an exigent and knowledgeable clientele and the quality of restaurants ; where the customers eat poorly from childhood , they can not very well know good food from bad . Even a goodnatural palate must learn to distinguish between subtlety and blandness , between clear strong flavors and raucous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Bocuse knows all this , and he is one of the most brilliant chefs in France . But he is also an enfant terrible who loves to play practical jokes. * In those recipes he gave Claiborne during that antiwoman interview , could hejust have been putting Americans on ? Or perhaps his recipeswere not faithfully transmitted . Since it was Bocuse who brought up innovation , let us examine those dishes . The navarin is an ancient women 's dish : mutton stewed with spring vegetables , which must include turnips to justify the name . Bocuse 's Navarin de Homards ( unaccountablytranslated by Claiborne as Baked Lobsters with An example : One mid-November weekend , Bocuse threw a surprise banquet for some forty restaurateurs , merchants , and journalists down from Paris for the annual Beaujolais tastings . It was an authentic medieval feast , except that a mystery wine was served , which the guests were asked to identify . Near the end , Bocuse revealed that he had mixed tag ends of bad wines . He succeeded in spoiling his own dinner by serving bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had n't the faintest notion what wine it was , but we could not drink it . We still regret having eaten that great meal without wine . ) It should be added that Bocuse is capable of extraordinary generosity to his colleagues.  |p179vegetables  although it never goes near an oven ) is a chichi travesty on the original . Five different vegetables are separately blanched ( the roots having been cut into fat matchsticks ) , then simmered with the lobster for an additionaltwenty minutes ; the cooking liquid is then thickenedwith THREE TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR . The vegetableswill be overdone and the sauce sludged up with flour ; the dish has neither the rustic simplicity of a mutton stew nor the eclat , the lightness and brilliance , of his more successfulcreations . When we queried Bocuse on his use of flour in this dish we received this reply : " I inform you that there must be no flour in the Navarin de Homard .... Not knowing English , I was not able to verify the recipe written by Craig Claiborne . " One may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poulet Saute au Vinaigre ( translated by Claiborne into " Sauteed chicken with tomato sauce " ) is said by the Lyonnaisto be a dish of the Rhone boatmen , made with the wine that had soured en route . The fact is that nearly everywhere in France women have made poulet au vinaigrefor centuries . The dish will vary slightly with regional differences in the chicken , the type of vinegar , the aromatics , and the fat used in the sauteeing . One of our prized recipes comes from an old woman in the causses of the Quercy who sauteed the chicken in goose fat with a clove or two of garlic and simply sprinkled verjus ( unripe grape juice ) on towards the last . If it were an older bird , she explained , she would put the verjus in right after the initial browning , thus demonstrating the origin of the dish ; vinegar and similar acids have a tenderizing effect . She warned against too much ; just enough to give " that little tart taste . " The whole charm of this ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bocuse and/or Claiborne did with 12 cloves of garlic , I/2 cup red wine vinegar , 3/4 cup white wine , i cup fresh or canned chicken broth , 3 tablespoons tomato paste , 1 lb. tomatoes , and tarragon.  |p180With  all that tomato and vinegar , it is difficult to see much difference between that sauce and ketchup. *It is instructive to examine a recipe , Poulet au Feu d'Enfer ( hell 's fire ) , from Ma Gastronomie by Fernand Point , under whom Bocuse worked . The recipe is clearly based on poulet au vinaigre , but Point wished to indicate that the presence of even a little tomato and so much vinegar was a daring departure from the classical version . Cut up a chicken and saute it in butter . When nicely browned and almost done , throw in a little finely chopped garlic . Deglaze with a good glass of wine vinegar , reduce , moisten with 4 tablespoons white wine , again allow to reduce , and moisten with a little consomme and a little tomato concentrate . Decant , skim , and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of butter ( and more vinegar if it is not highly enough seasoned ) at the moment of serving . ( Our translation . ) Bocuse 's final dish , Soupe aux Tru ff es Elysee , is a show stopper ; Newsweek described it as " orgiastic . " When a chef is presented with the Legion of Honor , clearly somethingspectacular is expected . ( Others have already chided Claiborne for reporting that Bocuse was the only chef ever so honored . ) The dish consists of butter , onions , celery , carrots , fresh mushrooms , Smithfield ham , I pound canned truffles , ' /4 pound fresh or canned foie gras , vermouth , and chicken broth , all baked in individual crocks topped with puff paste . In France , truffles and foie gras are at their best in midwinter ; in America , they are , for all practical purposes , unobtainable fresh and beautiful at any time . ( The recipe was presented to Times readers in late June . ) Canned truffles and foie gras , even when genuine , range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransom . Do you not know how to make puff paste ? Never mind . Claiborne , always ready with a puff , gives an address and the price , smack in the middle of the recipe . The baking of a puff paste over steaming broth is somethingno amateur should attempt . It certainly is dazzling , but the truth is that no matter how feathery , how airy the crust , it is going to turn sodden as it falls into the soup . Buttery , crunchy croutons would provide more attractive textural contrast and retain interest even after imbibing the liquid . The great Careme allowed that vol-au-vent was delightfulto the eye , but warned emphatically of the " painstakingcare " it required . The acknowledged master pastry chef of France was cautioning other professionals that , while it was spectacular , it was tricky and liable to end in disaster . What he said about puff pastry applies to most chef 's cooking in the hands of amateurs . Careme was wryly aware that a great deal of his success was due to the razzle-dazzle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic food under his **25;1478;TOOLONG was often very simply cooked ; one example is the lowly whiting cooked in butter , parsley , and a little lemon juice . What is surprising about these three Bocuse recipes as presented by Claiborne is the context : they were chosen to illustrate a massive promotion of la nouvelle cuisine , a movement precisely away from the floury excesses and ostentatious presentations of nineteenth-century cuisine and back toward the simpler , yet more refined sauces based on reduction of meat broths and other cooking liquids . Bocuse 's incorporated group , La Grande Cuisine Francaise ( which Courtine has called " some sort of a bizenesse " promoting conserves and wines for a fee ) , has left the impression that it invented la nouvelle cuisine . This is hardly grateful to Fernand Point , who many years ago taught the philosophy to some of the most illustrious members of Bocuse 's company . When Newsweek ( August 11 , 1975 ) invited Julia Childp182to comment on this new French revolution , she said , " They 've finally gotten it through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be stuffed full of fat and truffles . " Newsweek added that Mrs. Child 's new book would " echo a shift she perceives among Americans toward lighter and more adventurous cooking ? and one whose origins predated the revolution ' in France . " Yet , a few months later , People reports : " Julia is staunchly loyal to the rich sauces and gastronomic extravagances of the old French cookery , and its master chef , Auguste Escoffier , of whom she says stoutly , He 's codified everything in cooking . ' " ( December I , 1975 ; our emphasis . ) One may be forgiven , perhaps , for wondering whether Mrs. Child is for or against gastronomic extravagances and richness , so let us turn to the " lighter and more adventurouscooking " that she talked about to Newsweek . In San Francisco about that time ( mid-1975 ) , The French Chef demonstrated an array of her specialties , some of which would appear in From Julia Child 's Kitchen . For comparison with Bocuse , we 'll take three : Caneton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crepes a la Pagode en Flammes . Mrs. Child is exceedingly fond of aspics , which she describes as " a glistening poem ... of high sophistication " and " so dazzling you would think only a professional could execute it . " True , aspic dishes may be flashy , but they are seldom delicious . Unless they are made from calf 's foot , they have no gastronomic interest whatsoever . To keep the aspic from melting at room temperature , the usual solution is , of course , commercial gelatin ? whichis what Mrs. Child uses . A perfectly made aspic is a transparent , trembling creation that has most charm in hot weather , precisely when its presentation poses the greatest problems . People rarely take the trouble to serve it cradled in shaved ice , the only way to present it successfully . Hence , rubbery gelatin . When it is not in aspic , a Child adventure is likely to be encased in a pastry crust . Beef Wellington ( which is now passe , glory be ) is tenderloin partly roasted , cooled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and duxelles , wrapped in puff paste , baked , and served with a truffle sauce . Mrs. Child suggests instead a brioche crust ( with which we would not quarrel , except that the recipe she specifies is heavily sweetened ) , and for the sauce she suggestswhat she claims approaches a demi-glace that is made with " brown stock or canned beef bouillon . " Beef Wellingtonis not French . Escoffier , for example , gives more than fifty recipes for tenderloin of beef , not one of which is in a crust . For good reason . Beef does not take kindly to reheating , and under a crust it acquires a steam-table taste . Lovers of good beef leave Wellington alone . As for that flaming crepe dish , McCall 's described it as " Instant Elegance . " Not bad as a definition of gourmet cooking . Mrs. Child has a penchant for rolling things in crepes . A Child-like crepe dish appears in Cooking of Provincial France , a Time-Life production headed by M. F. K. Fisher , the late Michael Field , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separateoperations . Courtine summed it up nicely : " It 's a lot of work for such a meager result ! It 's the sort of dish to dazzle and beguile a foreign woman but it is false grand cuisine and as antigastronomic as can be . " As it happened , Time-Life had incautiously engaged Courtine to write the introduction and notes for a translationof its " French " cookbook , which it had the effrontery to put out in France . The notes , a blistering and brilliant commentary on the innumerable imbecilities in the book , were unaccountably printed with the translation , to the discomfiture of all concerned ? except the ineffable Courtine . We picked up our copy at the coming-out bash in Paris , and our report appeared in The New York Times under the tagline , " The Self-Roasting Cookbook . " ( We were never again invited to a Time-Life party . ) Courtine 's corrective comments can stand as a critique of fake French cuisine as taught by our leading mentors . For example : " Classic mayonnaise does not contain mustard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must not put garlic in onion soup .... Nobody would dream of adding croutons to tripe . " Where the authors state that game is not roasted , Courtine snaps , " Except partridge , pheasant , quail , etc . " Again correcting the authors , he advisesthat coarse rustic terrines are likely to be better in a restaurant than the fancy ones . And much more . Speaking of terrines , and of all that fat and those trufflesto which those thick-skulled Frenchmen are alleged to be addicted , Mrs. Child 's new book has a recipe for a pate that has r cup butter and 3/4 cup lard in the crust and 2 ? cups of pork fat and a pound of truffled foie gras in the stuffing . The truth is that the book abounds with recipes involving foie gras , truffles , and rich crusts . Among influential American food writers , only Claiborneputs more flour in sauces than does Mrs. Child . She explains : " It is actually the uncooked or poorly cooked roux , in my opinion , that has given flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only z or 3 minutes to cook flour and butter together , and since there is nothing difficult about it whatsoever , there is no excuse at all for a badly made sauce . " A roux is cooked in two or three minutes ? Escoffier did not feel it necessary to tell chefs how long to cook roux , but Larousse Gastronomique is specific : a white roux is to be cooked , stirring constantly with a wooden spatula , for five minutes , but without taking on color . ( Brown roux takes at least twice as long . ) But Mrs. Child 's recipe for bechamel-veloute says just cook the roux for two minutes , then cook the sauce for two minutes , and it is done . " All this beating of poor old Escoffier over the head , ' murmured Mrs. Child sadly , " in that New York Times interview . Poor old Escoffier indeed . Let us look at the recipe for bechamel in his Guide Culinaire . He uses far less flour , and simmers it gently for one hour . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it noted , is already a debased version of earlier bechamels . In his later years , Escoffier evolved toward a more refined cooking . In Ma Cuisine , written over thirty years after his classicp185Guide , he reduces the amount of flour to less than one tablespoon per cup of finished sauce for his Veloute Simpleand directs : " Conduct the cooking of the veloute at the gentlest simmer to facilitate the skimming and obtain a transparent sauce . Time of cooking and skimming : One and a half hours . " From Julia Child 's Kitchen makes the two-minute veloute seem easy : " you may want to simmer it longer , but this depends entirely on how strong and well-flavored the stock was to begin with .... " Mrs. Child appears not to understand that those hours of simmering and skimming are necessary to throw off the dross ? the grease and palpablepresence of the flour . If it were only a question of concentrating the flavor , that could be accomplished more easily by simple boiling , instead of simmering with the roux . If Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed his advice . Referring , presumably , to those same thick-skulled French chefs who at last are following the American example , Mrs. Child says : " A number of contemporary chefs in France , who profess to scorn brown roux ( flour and butter ) and other starchy sauce thickeners , have taken to blending a strongly reduced and concentrated meat stock into the deglazing of their roasts , and then thickening it with a liaison of butter . " She finds it too strong . In a general note she says , " You need not use your own homemadebrand of consomme either , of course , but you should most certainly disguise canned consomme ; a short simmer with some tasteful additions , and it becomes your own . " ( Our emphasis . ) ( For 8 cups strong , concentrated canned consomme , she adds , among other ingredients , % cup vermouth ! ) No amount of simmering with whatever additions is going to make canned consomme taste anythingbut canned . It is the presence of " taste enhancers " and other nasty additives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor becomes more objectionable , not less . No one can hope to succeed in making the lovely sauces of la nouvelle cuisine ( or l'ancienne ) who does notp186understand that they are based on beautiful produce , clarity and purity of flavor , and flawless technique . Flour in sauces is the crutch of a poor cook . In support of flour-based sauces , Mrs. Child notes that chefs Raymond Oliver , Rene Verdon , and Jacques Pepin use them . They do indeed . Haas . Pepin , an engaging fellow , who was Director of Research and Development for Howard Johnson 's and has been known to call for " canned beef gravy " in a sauce , puts flour even into fresh stewed peas ! Speaking of the chefs of la nouvelle cuisine , he told David McCullough in Book-of-the-Month News : " As for nonsense , take their theory that you can make sauces by reduction , by simply boiling and not adding flour . It does n't work . You can boil all you want and wo n't get a sauce . " But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new school of chefs , " as suggesting " a little roux moistenedwith milk and cream to pour over his delicate mousse of pike , his Quenelles a la Creme , " she misunderstands . A roux , dear lady , is butter and flour gently simmered , to which one adds liquid . What Point proposes in this recipe is a curious beurre manie , an amalgam of butter and flour , further softened with heavy cream , and added in bits to thicken the simmering milk ? a very different process . Out of more than two hundred recipes in Point 's Ma Gastronomie , flour enters a sauce but four times , and only in the form of beurre manie . According to some of his most brilliant students , it was added in tiny amounts ? " comme une noisette " ( like a hazelnut ) . Most often , however , Point finishes his sauces in one of two ways : one is to add thick cream and veal glaze to the cooking juices , then boil for a few minutes to blend and reduce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of butter to deglazed liquids or suitably reduced cooking juices , the method that Mrs. Child depreciates so . It is a fragile liaison of a finesse that can not be matched in any other way , but it does take beautiful ingredients ? and flair . Mrs. Child uses flour even in something she typicallyp187calls " Lentilles garnies ; lentilles en cassoulet " and in " Potagepuree de lentilles ; potage puree Conti , " which she claims is " along classic lines , including Careme 's turnip , " but she adds 3 tablespoons flour to only six cups of liquid already thickened with I ' /2 cups of pureed lentils . No cook would add flour to lentils ; they are quite farinaceous enough . We have not been able to find a single recipe in classic or regional cuisine that calls for flour with lentils ? these recipes may be unique . Her " New England fresh fish chowder " should be unique ; she adds 3 tablespoons of flour , sour cream , and croutons . Pilot crackers are traditional , but croutons ? flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julia Child 's Chowder " and add what she pleases ? In her new book , Mrs. Child reveals with disarming candor : " I certainly never knew a thing about yeast and dough until my colleague , Simca , and my husband , Paul , and I went through the 750 days of our great French bread spree , while we were working on Volume II of Mastering the Art of French Cooking . I had sometimes wondered , when I ordered a frankfurter and sauerkraut on a bun in one of those sausage snack bars , why the bun usually disintegrated into a slimy mess in the bottom of the plate . " Earlier , Newsweek had reported : " After 200 ... bakings , 250 pounds of flour and five months of toil ? Voila ! Julia Child has done it . She has made French bread out of bleached American flour . " Mrs. Child is indeed an industrious woman , but when she and we were young , many American housewives used twice as much flour in baking , day in and day out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the nineteen-page recipe for French bread that resulted was one of the few published in the United States that stuck to the correct ingredients : flour , yeast , water , and salt . It also gives much useful information on shaping the loaves . Its most serious fault is that there is no setting of the " sponge . " Most of us know that yeast is a living organism that requires moisture , food , air ,  |p188and  an optimum temperature ( around 700 F ) to grow and multiply , and that the lightness of bread is produced by the resultant gases that are trapped in the dough . What few people nowadays understand is that the flavor and texture are greatly affected by the strains of yeast and the speed of fermentation . ( We leave , for the moment , the question of quality of flour , although here also , she is not fussy . ) If you mix store-bought yeast with water and flour into a very soft dough and let it sit at 70 ? F for several hours , you will attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeasts to multiply in a leisurely fashion and the lovely wheaty taste will have time to mature . Additional flour is then kneaded in , and the dough goes through at least two more risings . We are talking about serious bread-making . The best bread is made from the time-honored " mother " dough ; a small hank ( depending on the size of the batch ) of dough is put aside for the next baking . Mrs. Child states : " Sour dough is an American invention .... We think that our recipe will give you a tastier loaf . " It may be doubted that the ancient Egyptians trudged down to the supermarket to buy foil-wrapped instant granulated yeast . While a number of societies early turned to yeasts based on ale brewing , most peoples clung tenaciously to the " mother " - dough method . To this day , bread made using a " chef " or " mother , " popularly known as pain au levain , is highly regarded in France and commands a premium price . ( In actual fact , such bread usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that the sponge method was employed , but the old-fashioned wheaty taste of properly fermented bread is implied . ) Sour dough differs from the " mother " method only in minor details ; the trick is to keep the " wild " yeasts alive and kicking until the next baking , and the precise way of doing it will depend on ambient temperature , frequency of baking , and tradition . The individual strains or races of these " wild " yeasts will give different results ? we have had tantalizingly different loaves when trying out variousp189ancient and primitive ways of attracting and assisting the growth of " wild " yeasts , although not so much , perhaps , as with various kinds of wheat and milling methods . It is interesting to note that since Volume II of Mastering the Art of French Cooking , Mrs. Child has heard tell of the " sponge , " which she calls " yeast batter " : it improves taste and texture , she tells us . But any serious baker knows this from childhood . A food writer 's opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . Commenting in McCall 's , on the new edition of Irma S. Rombauer 's Joy of Cooking , Mrs. Child deplores the disappearance of a recipe , " perhaps now a collector 's item , " for Baked Bean Sandwiches . For collectors , she repeats the recipe . It seems that you mash 1 cup baked beans , add lemon juice or ketchup or chili sauce or mustard and butter and minced onion or celery . This is spread on Boston brown or rye bread , sprinkled with chopped parsley , topped with strips of bacon , and the whole mess is stuck under the broiler . " Now , that 's a nice simple recipe , rather a frijoles refritos type of thing . " So much for Mexican cooking ; now let us see Mrs. Child tackle three cuisines at once , or perhaps it 's four . " Here we have rice and risotto the French and French Chef ways , " Mrs. Child says in her new book . She is introducinga recipe called Risotto garni . It has pork breakfastsausages , onions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisins , bananas , hard-boiled eggs , herbs , and " 1/2 cup or so chopped almonds , walnuts , pine nuts , peanuts , or whatever else in the way of nuts you have . " Mrs. Child explains : " risotto is a prime repository for leftovers . " She says this dish is really a kind of curry dinner , that her family first encountered it in a Chinese restaurant in Kandy , Ceylon , where it was known as " Flied Lice with Mix , " and that her family likes to eat it with chopsticks . Reason begins to falter . This is French ? This is risotto ? Pace , Child , but it is pure Trader Vic . The author treats lasagna in the same debonair way . Shep190recounts what happened when she presented her Lasagne a la Francaise on television : " I was almost lynched by the Italian anti-defamation league . What do you mean , using our national dish , lasagne , for leftovers . The very idea made me ill ! ' shrieked one letter from New Jersey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been " a bit carried away , and made a few Italianesque cracks .... " To objectors in the audience , The French Chef sends form letters . Mrs. Child continues : The one on lasagne , written with great enjoyment by me , tells enraged viewers that the whole idea of learninghow to cook is so that one can grab any idea from anywhere and put it to good use . Here it is the idea of lasagne that is " freed from ethnic restrictions and limitations , " and is ready for improvisation .... And to enrage them further , the final touch , " We should bethankful to the Italians for having invented lasagneshapedpasta , and to the French for their fine cooking methods that make such a splendid dish possible . " Strangely ? or should I say thankfully ? I have never had any reply whatsoever to this masterful rebuttal . To cap it off , Mrs. Child recommends serving French bread with her lasagna .... Improvisation is to be encouraged , but it requires a gift . Furthermore , nomenclature is not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child gives a recipe for Haricots secs garnis a l'alsacienne that calls for sauerkraut with ... black beans and olive oil ! " I do n't think this is Alsatian at all , but if the Alsatians were blessed with black beans they would surely use them in this hearty combination . " ( If they had olive oil . And if the Cubans had sauerkraut , would they call it a ChoucrouteHabanero ? ) Mrs. Child , incidentally , adds cornstarchto her sauerkraut . And then we get The French Chef 's Brandade a la soissonaise . A real brandade is salt cod pounded to a creamy mass , made fragrant with olive oil ( it is indeed a Provencal word meaning vigorously stirred , as she says ) , and they do grow beans around Soissons , hundreds ofp191miles to the north . By that reasoning , Mrs. Child gives us a peculiar sort of Arabian hummus of white beans with sesame paste , and calls it by a French Yankee-Dixie name . Black beans and olive oil in Alsace , sesame paste in Soissons , " Flied Lice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregard for the inner nature of a dish and for the region and the people who created it . Finally , it would seem , a dish is a let Francaise if Julia Child , The French Chef , says so . It is certainly not a la Francaise if French women createdit . We repeat the comment she made to The WashingtonPost , referring to the fact that her cookbooks had never been translated into French : " French women do n't know a damn thing about French cooking , although they pretend they know everything . " Mrs. Child herself , by friendly accounts , was a poor cook when she enrolled at the Cordon Bleu in Paris at the age of thirty-seven . ( Indeed , People reports that " Julia cooked as if the way to a man 's heart was through his stomach pump .... But Paul manfully shoveled it in because , he groans : I was willing to put up with all that awful cooking to get Julia . ' " ) In no time , she was herself teaching French cooking to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The instant chef is a pattern that seems to shock few Americans . There can not be many mothers who would send a child to study the violin with somebody who had taken it up only the year before . Yet it is commonplace for Americans to whip through a fast course in cookery and take up the career of creating gourmet chefs . It is tragic that American women , alienated from their own culinary past , should have so meekly followed the lead of the gourmet chefs in the kitchen . The cuisine they present , already second-rate Escoffier , is so corrupted with expediencies that all is travesty . There is no question that women cooks would benefit greatly from the professional training and discipline that are required of chefs , but this they are denied by thep192virtually medieval apprenticeship system in France . Apprenticeshipto a working chef is the ideal way to learn the trade ; so far the hotel schools have yet to produce a great cook . Executive chefs they turn out by the score . It 's the same in any metier that verges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider the thousands of well-trained male chefs in France . While most knowledgeable eaters would agree on the ten most brilliant , after that there would be less and less agreement . This is not a very high percentage of recognized artists . If there were anything like the same number of similarly trained women cooks , they could do no worse . Indeed , the one woman chef who managed to run the gantlet , Mme. Paulette Castaing , chef-patronne of the Beau Rivage at Condrieu , near Lyons , has her two stars from Michelin and the respect of her male colleagues . She is an attractive , intensely feminine person who , in spite of her smallness , was shown no favors during her apprenticeship and journeymandays . " It was not easy , " she admitted . Bocuse repeated the old routine about how " few great women architects and orchestra leaders " there are . We will leave aside as evident the biological demands made upon women in the bearing and rearing of children ? just at the time when a metier demands all of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed to women . There is , as well , a deep psychological and social barrier that is just beginning to budge , ever so little , here and there . Society will NOT tolerate from women the same ego , the same dignity , the same devotion to her work ( which almost inevitably leads to some neglect of her family and the concomitant feelings of guilt ) , the same search for fulfillment , and , above all , the same search for recognition of her work . Until very recently , indeed , actresses and women singerswere highly suspect . What passes for celebrity in a man is notoriety in a woman . This possibly explains why , among the arts , it is in poetry that women have had some individual successes ? often posthumously . It is such an in/ward , almost secret art , that even genteel women were able to learn the craft and practice it without showing up men ? the fatal error . It takes a courageous woman of great dedication to practice her art in the marketplace . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is particular irony in the fact that women are virtually barred from stardom in an art which is peculiarlytheirs , and have to suffer the indignity of loutish attacks from a Bocuse . We have already mentioned the daube , the cassoulet , the navarin . All these long , slow-cooking dishes , les petits plats mijotes , are women 's dishes , as are Boston Baked Beans , Brunswick Stew , New England Boiled Dinner , or whatever . They are dishes that make the best possible use of local produce , and they were invented by women who had to help in fields , milk the cows , tend the chickens , have the babies and mind them , do the housework , and still come up , day after day , with delicious meals for a hungry family , often from sparse and unpromising materials . No intelligent woman is altogether enchanted with being a housewife , but women , even the most militant feminists , should take pride in the womanly craft of cookery , and respect those who created it . Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of career people , men or women , than is chef 's cooking . All those great long-simmering dishes were created precisely to mind themselves while women occupied themselves with other work ; today , with new aspirations and modern conveniences , it is more important than ever that we not depreciatethis cuisine . Instead of foolishly aping the antics of French chefs , real or pretend , with all the expediencies and infinitely time-consuming froufrou that such cuisine demands , women would do better to learn and understand the cooking of their grandmothers . Not all women 's cooking is rustic . Women in prosperousregions who had time to fiddle with such things made dishes having a finesse and charm that a male chef would be hard put to equal . Beurre blanc , for instance , invented by the women of the Loire to go with the shad and pike that used to be so abundant there , is the loveliest of sauces . The great Curnonsky , who was from Angers ( on the Loire ) , claimed that only women could make it ; he exaggerated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Courtine praised . This sauce does not mask the taste of the fish ; the memory of shallot and white wine vinegar adds just the right aromatic note , and the fluffy butter supplies the richness that is desirable with these fish , which have a tendency to be dry . Mere Allard , one of the great women cooks of France , points out that it is finest with poached fish , somewhat less effective with plain grilled fish , and should never be served with sauteed fish . Male chefs , and those who pathetically try to emulate them , could learn lessons about harmony , basic lines of a dish , and the general rightness of things from such a cook . Mere Allard taught Fernande ( her daughter-in-law and successor ) how to make beurre blanc and Fernande told us . We give it here for the edification of Claiborne who , after tasting it a few years ago Chez Allard , ecstatically announced to his readers that French butter was so wonderfulthat this sauce " consisted simply of whisking the butter with a little water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in knocking the late Clementine Paddleford , that he " knew all the sauces . " He has always had difficulty with beurre blanc . He later published George Verrier 's recipe with a typical chef 's complication : 21/4 cups heavy cream , heavily reduced . As with any regional dish , there are numerous variations , but the addition of even a little cream is considered heresy up and down the Loire . Cream sludges up the wonderfully clear yet subtle taste and silken texture of a classic beurre blanc . Far stranger was the recipe that Claiborne gave in The New York Times Menu Cookbook . It called for 6 tablespoons butter , I cup heavy cream , I egg yolk , 2 tablespoons lemon juice , and Tabasco . Sacre bleu ! Beurre blanc is thought to be a very difficult dish , butp195we find it mainly a matter of beautiful produce and a little love . Buy the best butter you can find ? we make ours , but decent cream is getting more and more difficult to find . American shallots are the coarse-tasting red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior gray ones are unobtainable , we frequently use scallions instead ? they work , and give a fresh taste . Unless you have best white wine vinegar from France , you are better off with good cider vinegar ; it is often used in Brittany . As for the fish , catch it ? even in our port cities , fish markets go from bad to worse . Any handsome white-fleshed fish is fine ; besides the classic shad and pike , there is striped bass or red snapper , for instance . We will not go into the poaching of the fish except to warn you that the sauce will require your rapt attention for about fifteen minutes and will not stand , so until you have made it several times , it is prudent to set the poached fish on a rack over the fish kettle and to have all in readiness before you start in on the sauce . Mere Allard 's Beurre BlancTake three or four shallots and chop them fine . Put them in a heavy pot ( not aluminum ) with a quarter cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt ( omit for now if butter is salted ) , and several peppercorns . Reduce over a brisk flame until virtually dry , watching carefully because it must not even begin to turn color . Have a good pound of best butter ( very cold , Fernande stressed ) cut roughly into tablespoon-size chunks . Take the pan off the fire for an instant , put in a piece or two of butter , and stir with a wooden spoon until well incorporated . After a couple more such additions , change to a sauce whisk and place on the gentlest possible heat . Whisking madly all the while , add the butter , a chunk or two at a time . Check for seasoning ( you may add a few drops of lemon juice if it pleases you ) , and strain into a warm ( not hot ) sauce dish , or over the fish . Strew with finely chopped parsley . Steamed potatoes are the traditional accompaniment . If you are successful , you will have a fluffy , aromaticp196sauce . You will be able to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? it takes on a slightly gluey look , rather like a mayonnaise . Failure is due to excessive heat ; if it threatens to separate , you can sometimes rescue it by carefully settingthe pan in cold water for just an instant , then continuingon lower heat . If worse comes to worst , firmlyannounce it as beurre f ondu.  |p197Dining  OutHoward Johnson 's ? the Taste of America ! Television jingle NOT LONG AGO , the New Jersey Turnpike Authority canceled the Howard Johnson 's concession after seventeen years . It explained that the clientele had become tired of the food ? not of its awfulness , but of its sameness . An official said the new concessionaires would provide " gourmetfoods , international cuisine , chafing-dish service . " We waited two months to let the new management break in , then tried one of Marriott 's gourmet caravanserais . A truckdriver had told us that the food was " basically the same " as before , and indeed it was , though it came from a different commissary . We tasted a factory fruit salad ; canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a cotton tomato , laced with industrialdressing ; a tasteless , dry chopped beefsteak ; frozen shrimps dipped in a sweet crumb batter , fried , refrozen , and reheated ; cardboard pies ; and poor coffee with a nameless whitener . In short , the taste of America . When we asked a waitress about the history of the shrimps , she said , " I do n't know what they are ? I only serve it . " The manager more graciously acknowledgedp198that he had no cooks , and indeed regarded " these convenienceitems " as a costly substitute for real food ; he himself , he confided , cooked from scratch at home . " But we 've been getting a lot of good comments , " he said . Perhapsa public that has been educated to mistake fancy for good will accept the false promise of a chafing dish as an improvement upon the reality of thawed glop . There is , in fact , about as much difference in taste among our feeding chains as there is among makes of American cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is McDonald 's that should claim the Taste-ofAmericatitle . Back in 1973 , Time dedicated a cover story to Big Mac , " The Burger That Conquered the Country . " The piece was couched in that breathless admiration which billion-dollar successes inspire in business writers . But it did mention the objections of some effete elitists : Pop Sociologist Vance Packard laments : " This is what our country is all about ? blandness and standardization . " Novelist Vance Bourjaily extravagantly views McDonald 's popularity as a sign that America is " a failing culture . " He explains : " This country is full of people who have forgotten what good food is . Eating in most countries is a basic pleasure , but people in the U.S. do n't eat for pleasure . To them , eating is just something done in response to advertising . " Time went on to mention that some aesthetes regarded a McDonald 's outlet as a neighborhood blight , and that the nutritionist Jean Mayer of Harvard warns that a steady diet of its hamburgers , French fries , and synthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Since no one is forced to eat at a McDonald 's , the chain must be giving multitudes exactly what they want . " True , they can eat at Howard Johnson 's , or Burger King , or any other McDonald 's under another name . As for the taste of McDonald 's , Time brought up the big guns of gourmet food writing to rebut Bourjaily . They are worth quoting in full : p 199Craig Claiborne : " The hamburgers are quite swallowable . There is a highly compatible onion flavor . The French fries are first-rate ; they are made in fresh fat and are crisp . I do think they could put more pickle on the hamburger . Overall , I would rank them on a par with Howard Johnson 's hamburgers . " James Beard : " McDonald 's is a great machine that belches forth hamburgers . The whole thing is aimed at the six-year-old palate . They do n't salt things enough , and the malts taste like melted ice cream . But the place is efficient and clean , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it insulates . The food may be more honest than some things you get at higher prices . " Julia Child : " The buns are a little soft . The Big Mac I like least because it 's all bread . But the French fries are surprisingly good . It 's remarkable that you can get that much food for under a dollar . It 's not what you would call a balanced meal ; it 's nothing but calories . But it would keep you alive . " Gael Greene : " When I want meat , I want a steak . But when I want a hamburger , I want a Big Mac . It has all those disreputable things ? cheese made of glue , Russian dressing three generations removed from the steppes , and this very thin patty of something that is close enough to meat . It 's an incredibly decadent eatingexperience . And I love the malts ? thick , sweet and ice-cold . They 're better than if they were real . " The foregoing judgments tell us less about McDonald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " quite swallowable " ) ; the generous effort of Beard and Child to find something positive to say without losing the gourmet franchise ( the packaging , the prices , the frozen fries ) ; the East Side porno-chic of Greene , founder of the erotic school of food writing . To tell the truth , we had thought Greene was the only member of that school , until we read an essay in The New York Review about the new wave of porn novels by women , a genre we are unfamiliar with . The critic N. A. Straight remarks that in these oeuvres , " it is hard to figurep200out which is more important : food or sex . " One gathers that there is little sensual pleasure in either . Pending the publication of Greene 's new sex novel , here is another sample of her clever and brittle food-writing style : " Imaginean evening cuddling with a confirmed virgin . That was the ' 52 Mouton-Rothschild . It just would n't give . It 's not ready to be loved . " It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than was that ageless McDonald'sshake that Greene affected to adore ) , but how many readers would know , or care ? Horace Sutton quotes Clay Felker , the publisher of New York magazine , as boasting : " Gael never had a hot meal until we gave her the restaurant job . " Like most other American food writers , Greene by her own account made the leap from a badly fed childhood ( she was raised in a Velveeta cocoon , she told Sutton ) to haute cuisine a la Dione Lucas and Le Pavilion without ever having encountered good home cooking . In identifying its experts , Time omitted to mention their commercial associations . Beard , who was an actor before he got into the food game , has toiled for such clientsas Planters peanut oil , Green Giant , Nestle , RestaurantAssociates , and Pillsbury , the owner of the Burger King chain . Claiborne , as we have noted , is only half of a food-writing team , the other half being the executive chef of Howard Johnson 's . So Claiborne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Johnson 's " was praise indeed . It was , in fact , according to Mimi Sheraton , " like condoningHitler because he was on a par with Ivan the Terrible . " Sheraton , one of the few food writers who do honor to the trade , was contributing valuable shopping advice to New York magazine at the time . ( She has since moved to The Times . ) In the definitive piece on McDonald 's , she commented , " Howard Johnson 's burgers are worse than McDonald 's .... " Sheraton demonstrated that the Big Mac was a rip-off in price as well as nutrition and taste . At the time of her survey , she found that McDonald 's was effectively charg/ing from $3 to $4.20 a pound for beef worth 8o cents . The product , she said , was higher in price and poorer in quality than competing burgers . Ditto for the French fries and synthetic shakes . As for the taste , we can not improve on Sheraton 's findings : McDonald 's food is irremediably horrible , with no saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extruded by heavy machinery that compacts it so that the texture is somewhat like that of baloney sausage , and it becomes rubbery when cooked . Once cooked , the burger is insulated in a soggy bun , topped with pickle slices that seem recycled , or dehydrated onion flakes , or shredded lettucethat is more like wet confetti , and one or another of the disgusting sauces . All is wrapped in paper , then closed in a sturdy , airtight box , " cooked to inventory " as they say in the trade , and set aside until ordered . Potatoes may be crisp , but they have no taste . The shakes ( significantly not called milk shakes ) are like aerated Kaopectate . Sheraton said she would never eat a McDonald 's " filet , " having tasted one at the mill in Gloucester , Massachusetts , where blocks of frozen fish are sawed , fried , and refrozen . " We sell more fish now that it does n't taste like fish , " a sales manager told her . " As I took a sample of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't it ? ' I low could I be the one to tell him crisp ' is not a taste ? " 1 low could she , indeed , contradict the judgment of those gourmets who so admired the crisp French fries ( Claiborneand Child ) , the pickle and the onion powder ( Claiborne ) , the insulation ( Beard ) , and the secret sauce they identified as a mayonnaise remoulade " not to be thrown overboard " ( Claiborne , of course ) . Sheraton called that last an oily , sweet-sour emulsion that " should be thrown , if not overboard , then down the toilet . " If , as Sheraton suggests , " what McDonald 's is guiltiest of is perverting the tastes of children , " then the gourmets may fairly be taxed with perverting the taste of grown-P202ups . But it may be argued in their defense that the fastfoodchains succeeded with little direct help from the lifted-pinky brigade . True , when they are not working at the trade , gourmets often reveal themselves to be charter members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that , in privacy , his favorite beveragewas Pepsi . Julia Child told Sheraton that she loved " those cute little goldfish crackers people serve with cocktails , and then , of course , hot dogs and hamburgers with onion , pickles and ketchup . " Beard called himself " a hot dog fiend , " even eating them for breakfast , and confessed to a passion for raw marshmallows . And Sheraton continued : " Almost any hot dogs and hamburgers dripping ' with ketchup , and Hershey almond bars , are also among Craig Claiborne 's junk food fancies . " But in their writing for pay , the gourmets have seldom shown much interest in what ordinary Americans eat . Rather , like their colleagues on the women 's pages and in the women 's magazines , they entertain ordinary Americanswith the fashions and foibles of the rich . The affluent themselves are of course easily persuaded . Critics of McDonald 's are accused of being elitists ? i.e. , snobs . But what could be more snobbish than the followingdefense by David S. Sampson , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans : " I like McDonald 's . I do n't like the food . I do n't like to eat there . I feel uncomfortable when I go in . But I like McDonald 's because they seem to care a little for the poor . Maybe it 's all business and they really do n't . But they seem to , and even that 's rare enough these days . " * ? The implication is that good food is too good for the common people , and if they are happy with their swill , why should we object ? as long as we do n't have to share it ? But the joke is on the affluent . When they step out to dine by candlelight , the chances are growing that theyP 203will eat the same thing they and the common folk are eating at home ? TV dinners . The only real difference is the price . The dirty secret of American luxury dining is precooked frozen food . It will remain a secret , because the industry has no intention of allowing the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . When San Francisco considered an ordinance to require that restaurants disclose which items had been frozen , it was shot down by the massed artillery of the local industry . Victor Bergeron , founder of the Trader Vic 's chain and a dedicated foe of authenticity in cuisine , * called the bill " the damndest , goofiest , craziest thing I 've ever heard of " and insisted that there was nothing wrong with frozen food . Then why did n't the owners want to label their offerings as frozen ? A fairly desperate explanation was offered by Roland Gotti of Ernie 's , which was rated by Holiday as " one of the world 's few truly great restaurants . " He testified that it would add to costs if restaurantshad to change their menus " every time a frozen item is temporarily substituted for an unavailable fresh item . " The clinching argument , however , was that a Truth in Dining law would sap San Francisco 's gastronomicreputation and thus reduce its convention business . As Jack Shelton , an independent restaurant critic , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicken ? Trader Vic 's Book of Mexican Cooking recounts that when the author was asked to open a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco , " I knew as much about Mexican food as my greatgrandmotherin the Pyrenees . " So he went to Mexico . " I ate Mexican food until it almost gave me an ulcer . In Mexico it was pretty greasy . The finest Mexican food I have enjoyed came from what is known as Texas-Mex . Now , I know I 'm going to make a lot of Mexicans sore as hell ? you have to understand that I am an American , not a Mexican , and I eat what pleases me most . " What pleases Trader Vic most is canned brand-name soups and sauces . Reading his recipes nearly gave us an ulcer . P204Kiev they eat in San Francisco is the same as the one they eat in Duluth . " There are many restaurants using frozen food , but no one is going to admit it , " Pierre Franey told The New York Times in an interview . Franey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that virtually all the fancy restaurants now used freezers , if only to tuck away leftovers . " Nobody 's going to admit that , " he said , " but they do n't throw it away , either . " He saw nothing wrong in this . In fact , he said , if he were still cooking at Le Pavilion , which in its heyday was regarded as the best restaurant in the country , he would use the freezer . " I would make sauces in large batches and freeze them , " he declared . " The technique has improved . There is nothing wrong with this ? and there is nothing wrong with frozen dough , frozen brioche dough , for instance . If you have a good freezer and keep it at to below zero all the time , it is going to be beautiful . " It may be doubted that the late Henri Soule would have allowed Franey to do anything of the kind . Soule was a notorious perfectionist , who closed the Pavilion when help and produce became inadequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing , any butter sauce , or any other emulsion , would break down . In fact , sauces threaten to break down even at kitchen temperatures . That is why restaurant chefs cheat by adding flour , to escape the fragility of the pure , concentratedjuices . All American " gourmet chefs " follow their example . But any cook who respects the craft would regard freezing a sauce as vandalism . We doubt also that Franey 's frozen brioche dough does quite as well as the fresh . One may forgive a baker who resorts to freezing dough so that he may sleep nights , but he should not pretend that it is just as good . Even where they have not surrendered to buying food that has been cooked elsewhere , most fancy restaurantsP205now cook large batches and freeze them , to save time and enable them to offer a large menu with a minimum of waste . The practice is not new , nor exclusively American . Back in 1965 we ran into a young Philadelphian who was working as a student saucier in a famous restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food was not up to its rating , and he confided , " They play games with the freezer . " He announced that when he got home , he was going to open a very expensive restaurant that would make no compromises . Eight years later , we visited his place ( one of the two better French restaurants in Philadelphia ) and asked him what he had since learned . " That compromises are essential , " he replied . Another Howard Johnson 's executive , Frank M. Barrett , told Fast Foods magazine : " I think anybody who 's not using convenience foods is out of it . And some of the prepared food around today is top quality . You 'd never know the difference . We 're going to open a restaurant a week this year 1973 , and where could we get cooks and chefs for this kind of expansion ? Even if we could get them , we could n't train them fast enough . " To say that there are n't enough good cooks is a breathtaking understatement . But when restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has killed his parents and pleads for mercy as an orphan . ( A reader wrote us that his wife had applied to Stouffer 's for a job and had been told that it hired no cooks , only " thawer-outers . " ) The New York industry , mounting a crash course for cooks , devoted eight class hours to Reconstituting Convenience Foods . The operators prefer to employ unskilled labor ; many of their employes , among the lowest paid in the city , must draw on welfare to support their families . Convenienceis for owners . It spares them the hassle of going to market for the best or cheapest available produce , and of supervising its proper preparation . Even unskilled help can peel and fry potatoes , which are better to eat andP206cheaper than the frozen product , but it 's a nuisance , and , as the operators repeat ad nauseam , the public does n't know the difference . For the fast-food chains , the profit margin is such that putting out the real McCoy is not worth the bother . Food Processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain 5 cents and sold for 20 cents . " Only soft drinks yield a greater percentage of profit , " it said . For the restaurant of pretension , a frozen " gourmet " dish that cost it $1.38 could be sold for $7.50 , whereas traditionally , operators have figured on food costing 30 to 40 percent of the bill to the customer . Many restaurants now " slush down " a day 's supply , which means that they allow the dishes to thaw to about 400 , and on order , pop one into the microwave or convection oven . At the end of the day , the unused portions go back into the freezer , of course . The food processors have made restaurant owners an offer they can not refuse . Some produce as many as two hundred " gourmet " dishes , enabling a hostelry without a cook to boast a menu as fancy as Delmonico 's . Meats come partly precooked , with grill marks burnt in , and there is also the now popular abomination of Surf ' n ' Turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the taste of neither . " Breaded shrimp , oysters , crab meat specialties , lobster Newburg and pompano are packed in attractive packageswith four-color illustrations and tend to make a chef proud of preparing a gourmet entree , " the magazine Quick Frozen Foods reported . That was in 1973 , which one supplier of equipment to the industry described to us as " the year of the breakthrough . " The magazine said its survey had found that a majority of restaurants already used some prepared frozen foods and planned to use more . Not surprisingly , up to 8o percent and more of the fare served by chains and industrialfeeders was precooked . More disturbingly , the independent restaurants ? the last holdouts and our onlyp207hope ? were either folding up or joining the frozen-food parade . The demise of small business is an accepted by-product of a misguided modernism . Even in France , the expresswayhas been the death of some fine inns on the byroads , and no turnpike authority would dream of renting its valuable concessions to Maman et Papa . A Parisian bankingsyndicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warned in its opening announcement , " One does not take the autoroute to practice gastronomy . " In the States , urban blight and urban renewalcombine to make life impossible for Mom and Pop . We had the occasion , during one summer in New York , to write the obituaries of two good fifty-year-old family restaurants , evicted to make way in the one case for a parking lot , in the other for a skyscraper . Even if the restaurant operators could have afforded the skyscraperrents , no building promoter would have them , because investors want to see long-term leases signed by corporations with top credit ratings . Like the autoroute , the skyscraper rents its captive clientele to an enterprise that installs feeding stations at several levels , their prices rising with the altitude , all being supplied from a central thawing station below ground . We visited some of these stations in the line of duty , when the male half of this writing team served a hitch as food critic of The New York Times . One of them was Top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , which long ago was a family enterprise famed for its chicken pies and pastries . Here is our report : The press release said that sometime in July this 15-year-old landmark would serve its ten millionth meal , and the lucky diner would win a Bermuda holiday for two . That called for a visit , at $35 with wine and tip , for two . We did n't win . People who like Muzak and the Radio City show may well like the Top of the Six 's ; in fact , many dinerswere evidently pleased . What was remarkablep208about our food was the lack of taste , in both senses : no taste to the shrimp cocktail , nor to the beautifullookingtomatoes , the zucchini in tomato sauce , the filet mignon , bland , tenderized and quite cold , as were the " French fries . " The last were reheated on request but preserved that unmistakable mushiness of frozen precooked and reheated fries . My " beef Stroganoff " was a Swiss steak on noodles reminiscent of a hundred airline meals . We passed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , combined veal , crabmeat and whipped cream . We also ducked the orange sherbet with chocolate sauce , but tasted the " chocolate souffle , " a whipped pudding concoction . The coffee was indifferent , the wines ( a Pouilly-Fuisse and a Medoc ) good and reasonable . We asked to see the kitchen whence these wonderscame and were told that it was closed to thepublic and anyway was 40 floors down . We returned , cognito , and anywaycourteously received by MartinBrody , the general manager , who showed us the various production stations with their steam tables , pressure cookers and ovens . " We do n't have a chef system , " he explained , " we have a food management system , with dieticians who are either home economists or A.D.A. ? trained . " ( That 's the American Dietetic Association . ) The specialists who devise the menus work in Cleveland , headquarters of the Stouffer 's chain , which formerly was a division of Litton Industries and now is in the Nestle family . Mr. Brody described Stouffer 's as a **26;1505;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-feeding stations that do practically no cooking at all . He showed with pride the ovens where puffy small loaves , made from frozen dough , are " proofed " and baked daily . Asked why pies and cakes were not on the dinner menu , he replied that they were n't selling , whereas the " distinctive things , " like the chocolate thing and the orange sherbet in chocolate , were . Who needs cooks ? P209We met those sweet loaves in scores of restaurants around the country , and saw some on sale at the counter to take home . " Reconstituted , these have the appearance of homemade bread , " Quick Frozen Foods reported . " When brought to table on a cutting board , along with a sharp knife and generous amounts of butter or margarine , the loaves serve as an icebreaker ' in gaining the patron 's confidence in the restaurant 's food and service . " What was even more distressing for us than Top of the Six 's was to follow the advice of Holiday magazine and make " a gastronomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meet the same sort of meal . This shrine was built by the late Albert Stockli , who , as we wrote , was " a sort of P. T. Barnum of Americancuisine who dazzled the expense-account yokels with such stunts as truffles in artichoke with mustard ( flambe , naturellement ) , Wild Fowl of Samos ( chicken ) in sherriedtomatoes , and so weiter . " Gourmet Continental cuisine , if ever there was . It is said that Stockli made up for the bizarreness of his menus by the quality of his foodstuffs . We are not convinced , all the more because in a 1970 interview he predicted that all restaurants soon would be serving precookedfrozen dinners . Anyway , we got Stockli recipes , frozen and reheated , at $40 for two . There were among other things a soup of cherries whipped with cheese and cinnamon , a veal chop drowned in a mess of mushroom , chestnut , and perhaps carrots , and a rack of lamb that arrived cold . The headwaiter said haughtily that lamb ordered rare ( that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's precooked .... There was a time in the memory of Americans still living when travel in our country could be a gastronomicadventure . Railroads , river boats , and steamships vied with one another in food and service . Menus changed with seasons and regions : jambalaya in Louisiana , Brunswickstew in Georgia , scrapple and crab cakes and shadp210in the Mid-Atlantic states , wild mountain trout in the Rockies , lobster stew and chowders and baked beans with ham and brown bread in New England . And if the hotel menu palled or was too dear , the locals might direct one to a tearoom kept by two spinsters who served good plain cooking and superb pastries , or a boardinghouse where , on Thursday nights , the housewife served a stewed hen with dumplings that was memorable .... No more . For the food lover , travel in America today is an unmitigated ordeal . Whether he goes by car , rail , or air , all he can hope for is gourmet glop a la Marriott or Howard Johnson 's . Amtrak , seeking to revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has not tried to revive the old culinary standards . It now proposes one nationwide menu of " international " junk such as Tournedos Mexicana , an affront to an inoffensiveneighboring country : two tenderized frozen fillets broiled and covered with Swift 's Knorr " sauce Bearnaise . " Or a tomato bisque made , according to the official instructions , of a can of tomato soup and " a halfcanof chicken stock ( if available ) or water " and halfand-halfcream . The food is , in short , not distinguishable from that served in the air , the only differences being that on the train , the diner eats in relative comfort , drinks real , if indifferent , coffee , and is billed separately for the meal . Soon after our family moved East in the late 1940s , we adopted what we called Moses ' Law : Do n't eat at park concessions . It was named after Robert Moses , who was then New York 's commissioner of parks and everything . But this turned out to be unfair . The rule was actually universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : The quality of food and service is inversely proportional to the captivity of the clientele . In other words , when a concessionaire draws patronage because it has nowhere else to go ( e.g. , airports , airliners , expressways ) or because of the beauty of the site ( e.g. ,  |p211ato|p  skyscrapers or the Eiffel Tower or on a sightseeing boat ) , he tends to skimp on the merchandise . When we mentioned this in a column once , an airline public-relations chief who asked to remain anonymous wrote to say that its clients were not captives , because they could always switch to another line , and in any case , there was a bloc of unfortunately silent patrons who did like the food . True , they can change airlines , but they can not change the food ? not since the great sandwich war of the early years of jet travel , when airlines , which had sensibly agreed to serve only sandwiches on short flights , cheated by offering ever-fancier spreads . When the caviar began to nibble into the profits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertise the voluptuousness of their fare and of their stewardesses ( Fly me ! ) , but the reality of the fare never corresponds to the promise . ( This applies , incidentally , to Air France , despite the raves of gourmet writers who have been regaled with special dinners in its commissary at Kennedy International Airport . Moved by the protest of French travelers , the home office has wisely begun to serve , on short flights within Europe , snacks based on good French bread and cold meats and cheeses . ) It is unhappily evident that a silent majority of passengersdo find the food at least edible , whether because they have been tranquilized by liquor or because they eat no better at home , or both . In restaurants , the majority are not silent ; on the contrary , there is a happy hum in a successful restaurant that normally adds to the pleasure of dining . A well-known promoter in Paris once confided to us that he had instructed his architects to install mirrorsand other hard surfaces precisely to encourage this sound . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented diners is more painful , to a food lover , than canned music . We withstood that discord for nine months of profes-P212sional dining . With some pleasant exceptions , our eating ranged from bad to mediocre . And this was mostly in New York , which , no doubt because it is the most foreign of our cities , still provides the most interesting food in America . Does that sound New York ? provincial ? Unpatriotic ? Well , where are the American restaurants ? So impeccably American an institution as the 1974 Mobil Travel Guide gave its top rating to six restaurants in the United States , of which five were " French " and one Chinese . Holiday conferred its Distinctive Dining Awards on 163 , of which 97 were " French , " 19 " Italian , " and the rest a potpourri of exotica including old Englishe ( Holiday 's spelling ) , Franco-Oriental , Franco-Russian , Continental , and pseudoPolynesian . ( " Trader Vic 's , " a San Franciscan boasted to us , " is the only Polynesian restaurant where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks around " French " and " Italian " are of course our own . A large majority of employes of " French " restaurants in this country never worked in a French restaurant . Most of those with French passports are Bretons , many of whom come from a village near Brest that is not noted for gastronomy . A former aide at the French consulate in New York recalls registering them . " One listed his occupation as coiffeur or cook . ' I look for hair in my soup . " We once saw employes of a " French " restaurant in New York eating asparagus drowned in ketchup . Even among the professional French cooks to be found in some of our better restaurants , few if any have completedthe long , hard climb from apprentice to helper to sous-chef to chef of a serious restaurant in France . Why would a successful chef , working with French assistants and French produce in his own country , want to come here ? During World War II , some refugee chefs gave a lift to . our cuisine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sciences . With such a pool of talent , P 213Henri Soule made Le Pavilion into a great restaurant . But one by one , his key people left , and comparable replacementscould not be found . Standards suffered . The late Charles Masson of La Grenouille , who was one of Soule 's original team , told us : " I remember the way pommes noisettes were started continually , twenty minutes before being served . In the last years , they were made at three p.m. , and reheated .... " Finally , Soule closed Le Pavillon . " What happened to Soule will happen to me , " Masson said . " The day my best workers leave me , they will be irreplaceable . " In Paris once , we attended the cooking finals of the annual contest for the best graduate apprentice of the year . A restaurant owner from Cape Cod offered the winnera job as " chef " at three times the wages he could expect as a young journeyman in France . The boy was tempted , but turned the job down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a sitting . " " That 's not cooking , " he said . " That 's feeding . " Some youngsters do , however , make the leap , choosing sure employment at high pay in the United States over the slow and competitive climb to master craftsmanship in France . These are our French chefs . One who opened an expensive restaurant here not long ago confided : " You come here figuring on making a little money , having a good time , and then going home . But you get married , and buy a house and a car , and then it 's too late . " The sense of having abandoned a craft may help account for a touching phenomenon . Expatriate chefs here , on their days off , head for colonies in exurbia where they spend much of their free time gathering mushrooms , fishing , and otherwise assembling good fare , making sausages and pates , and proving to one another that they can cook the good , earthy food that their mothers used to fix ? la vrai cuisine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very French , our " Italian " restaurants are even less Italian . A second andP214third generation of cooks and clients have drowned a great culinary tradition in a red tide of canned tomato sauce on limp factory pasta . When we hinted , at a populartrattoria in Brooklyn , that such a meal was not precisely authentic , the young owner retorted , " This is Italian-American cooking . " A similar thought was conveyed to us once at Sabatini , an overrated restaurant in Florence . Perhaps from force of habit ( we lived in France then ) , we had ordered our meal in French . As we were leaving , the headwaiter asked us if we had enjoyed the food and service . " Ni l'un , ni l'autre , " one of us replied . " Ah , monsieur , " the man said with a commiserating grimace , " you must come back some time when there are not so many Americans . " We never did .... We doubt that Sabatini is much better when the Americans are not there , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains its standards only to the degree that it caters to clients of its own nationality . In the restaurant field as in home cooking , the gourmet hacks have persuaded the public that foreign and fancy are synonymous with good . This is not a total loss , in the rare cases where the foreign is authentic or the fancy is well done . But it has been nearly fatal to our own culinaryheritage . An extraordinary example of this was the dinner thrown by President **26;1533;TOOLONG for Comrade Brezhnev at the White House . The menu was printed in mangled French , and the recipes seemed to correspond . The plate of resistance ( if we may ) was Supreme of Lobster en Bellevue , an aspic unknown to haute cuisine . It baffled even the French , who were , however , delighted with the Franglais . A writer in a hotel trade paper in Paris chortled , " J'attends d'etre invited at the White House . J'y speakerai english with M. Nixon without difficulties ! " For his turn , Brezhnev had an allRussianfeast flown in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an assortment of game , P215strawberry mousse , Soviet wines . The Kremlin won the match hands down . Why did n't Nixon serve Maine Lobster Stew ? It took Frenchmen to explain . Those globetrotting food writers Henri Gault and Christian Millau of the Guide Juillard have said in another context , " Americans suffer from an inferiority complex in this regard , and there is not , as far as we know , a single American restaurant that has achieved glory with oyster pie , snapper soup , ham steak , or even fried chicken , shad roe , clam chowder and other authentic American dishes . And it 's too bad . " This would not have been their finding as recently as the 1930s , before the present generation of gourmet snobs took over . Even today , a well-heeled and welldirectedtraveler can with luck run across an occasional sample of our ancient culinary glories . But if Gault and Millau are largely correct , their diagnosis is incomplete . The primary reason why restaurants do n't serve glorious Americana today is that their produce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only the flacks who tried to persuade the public that the food was getting better . What gives hope is that , in spite of the fact that they have dominated the media since the war , they have not entirely succeeded . We must now get into the act , briefly . As we have mentioned , one of the authors yielded to an urgent appeal to take over the critic 's job at The New York Times in early 1973 , with the understanding that he would not have to stay longer than a year . We threw in our napkinsafter nine months , sick of the gourmet plague that had marked our first meal for pay , and our last , and most of those in between . This was not much of a surprise to us . But what was extraordinary was the response of hundreds of readers who wrote that they felt the same way , but had thought that it was they who were out of step . For a sample of what we were eating and what weP216were writing about it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , reprinted in the Appendix . It may now be revealed that the hotel where the chef apparently could not make a souffle with bits of fruit suspended in it was the Waldorf-Astoria . The occasion was a gourmet society 's dinner , and our review ended : If we were appointed by a club of food lovers to arrange a gastronomic dinner , we 'd send out scouts to scour the city and the countryside for fresh fish , garden produce , chickens that scratch in the dirt and eggs laid by such fowl , and maybe some wild mushrooms , and we 'd hire a cook who knew how to fix such things so they taste as they are . The food and wine societies would also serve the cause of good eating and drinking if they encouraged those few farmers , bakers and other artisans who preserve what is left of old traditions of quality . Each of them deserves a certificate of honor , and a price for their work to make it worthwhile . Sadly , the gourmet society never took up our appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature lovers fights to defend nature against the encroachmentsof loggers , strip miners , and polluters , but who ever heard of a gush of gourmets protesting the erosion of our food supplies ? Since the function of these groups is chiefly to establish that they eat better ? that is , fancier ? than other Americans , the disaster that has hit our common tables only enhances their sense of superiority . It is status , not food , that they love . Rather than consider the foregoing appeal as a call for help , the leaders of the food fraternity took it as a declaration of war ? on them . Perhaps it was . P217The HustlersSome emoluments fall on all those whopractice journalism . Horace Sutton , defending travel writers againstthe charge that they are whoresGROUCHO MARX once said he would not join any club that would accept him as a member . On the same wise ground , we should not elect anybody who wanted to be President , nor take the advice of anybody who enjoyed . being a food critic . Catch 22 . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a long experience with it would want the job , not in America today . This has not , sadly , penetrated the consciousness of many editors . We received an appeal from a cub reporter who had just been appointed as restaurant critic of a major newspaper in the heartland . I lc asked us for a quick fill-in on " saddle of lamb and all that stuff . " We advised him not to take the job . He never replied . No responsible editor would dream of assigning someone to review a concert who did not know the difference between Bach and Gershwin , or did n't care . But it is routine to assign anybody who happens to be available to review restaurants . The assumption seems to be that everybody eats , and that should be enough . The critic ofp218a major publication , a man who is the soul of probity , confides to friends that he does n't care much about food , and has even indicated as much to readers , in a laudatory review that began : " Restaurant reviewers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buds than we are with ours , may disagree , but . . . " He proceeds to rave about a Mexican pepper dish that is " pure green fire . " Readers are told : " For a new taste sensation that may leave you numb for the next 24 hours , try this . Quite wonderful , and accompanied by saffron rice and pinto beans , at $4.50 . " How did he taste the saffron ? One of the burdens of serious dining for pay is that the critic , when panning a restaurant , is also panning the taste of those who like it , including , quite often , friends and colleagues who have tipped the critic off to this find . There is , of course , inherent in any criticism an assumptionthat those who disagree are mistaken , but the literary critic who gives the back of his hand to a shlock bestsellerlives in a class that shares his values at least in part . Not so with the qualified restaurant critic . To cite that comment in our Stouffer 's review , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find nothing amiss in the fare at Top of the Six 's . Indeed , the state of the cultivated palate is such that , in 1976 , The Times Magazine could declare : " Commercially grown mushrooms are actually superior to those growingwild in fields and pastures . " James Beard has harrumphed that the San Francisco restaurant critic Jack Shelton " enjoys being destructive . " On the contrary . The critic has every motive to be positive . He desperately seeks places or at least dishes he can recommend to his readers ? after all , that is his primary job . For our part , we never panned an unsuccessfulrestaurant ( what is the point of warning the public against a danger that it is not likely to encounter ? ) , although this meant we had to eat many an awful meal without even getting some copy from it . We panned successful restaurants only to sharpen perceptions of corn/mon shortcomings , and only because there were not enough pleasant experiences to fill a weekly column . Even so , there was always the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively satisfactory dish or two . We never had occasion to regret a negative review ; we did suffer remorse once or twice when hindsight showed us to have been too kind . To send a reader to a bad meal is unpardonable . A good professional critic eats worse than a good amateur . The amateur hunts out one or a few restaurants within traveling distance and the range of his pocketbook , learns the strong points and the weaknesses , cultivates an understanding with the staff that will lend meaning to the question " What 's good today ? " ? and settles down to a long relationship . The critic who wants to tell his anonymous readers what they will find must be anonymoustoo , and must try all the likely places , and eat what the house recommends to a stranger . We have likened this to playing Russian roulette with five bullets in the revolver . The importance of anonymity was brought home to us one evening in Paris when we allowed some friends to lure us away from our habitual places to try a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in i.e Monde . Courtine , who in our view is far and away the best food critic in the world , had for years been lashing his country 's restaurateurs to revive the woman-made glories of regional cuisine . ( This passion is as notorious as his evil disposition . We once attended a luncheon for the gastronomic press at an enchanting inn in the Pyrenees , where the host had killed two sheep to make a sort of Basque haggis ? stuffed stomach ? in Courtine 's honor . The critic sniffed around the kitchen , and disappeared . When we caught up with him in Biarritz that evening , we asked him how he had known that the lunch would be mediocre and the haggis inedible ; he merely wrinkled his nose and shrugged complacently . ) So when he wrote about a Savoyard meal he had savored at Le Chamonix , P220just off the Champs Elysees , we looked forward to followinghis lead . On being seated , we were handed typical , banal Parisian tourist menus . We called le patron and asked for the dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not serve them . We prepared them for Monsieur Courtine . " With such experiences in mind , we sometimes remarked to French confreres that we readers did not eat in the same restaurants where they ate . But the rich ( i.e. , Americans ) can afford scruples . French publishers , even when they do not tie a plug to advertising , are reluctant to pick up the tabs for critics , and on their modest space rates , the critics can hardly be expected to do so themselves . The practice of critics ' charging restaurants for a plug , or at least knocking them down for a good meal , seems to be as old as restaurants themselves ; it is said that Grimaud de la Reyniere , the first critic , shook down the chefs of the first grand restaurants of the late eighteenthcentury .... A saving element is that the French public implicitly doubts the motives of journalists and politicians . Further , a large segment of that public can judge good food for itself , and has a large array of good restaurants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Yet the holiday junket , the free meal , and the puff for advertisers are very nearly as prevalent in American travel-and-dining journalismas in the French . John Wilcock , himself a travel writer , said in a Times article about his colleagues : " They 're whores , except for the biggest names .... They do n't make any criticism and the reason is obvious : Their publications would lose money .... Most travel writing ? the airline magazines , the canned releases and planted stories ? is just P. R. bull , paying back somebody 's free trips . " One of the biggest names in travel writing , Horace Sutton of Saturday ReviewlWorld , replied angrily that the Times itself was not pure , since some of its free-lance contributors solicited freebies on the strength of their assignments . " How else would the writer survive ? " heP221demanded . Not , he said , on what the travel section paid . " Some emoluments fall on all those who practice journalism , " he said , listing various facilities offered to Times people , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he allowed , " but no more , I would judge , than among sportswriters , financial writers , White House correspondentsor political pundits . " There is more truth in this , perhaps , than Sutton had in mind . Nonetheless , the quiz-show and payola scandals of the 1950s did make freeloading a subject of embarrassment to the more respectable media , and with the engagement of Claiborne in 1957 , The Times introduced the rule that a restaurant critic dines incognito , pays his bill , and may criticize as well as praise . A scattering of honorable publications have since adopted the incognito rule , but a majority still treat food writing as a branch of advertising , and apply the same ethics to both . " Inspectors " for the major hotel and restaurant guides do not as a rule even eat in the places they rate , much less pay the bill . Those of the American Automobile Association ( 13.5 million copies a year ) are really salesmen , collecting $too and up for each listing . The Mobil Travel Guide ( 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food is a prime consideration " and " Every kitchen has been inspected , " but its inspectors tat at very few of the 21,000 places it rates , and then they call ahead . The inspection , if any , is mainly for cleanliness ? " So much so , " reported Linda Scarbrough in a Times review , " that field inspectors are encouraged to carry pocket mirrors around with them ? to check out the underside of all toilet-bowl rims . " She quotes Steven . %Icra , the chief editor of the guide , as saying , " Some places with really great food we might not rate at all , because they 're dirty . " A responsible guide , like the Michelin , must have a staff of able and anonymous in%pectorswho eat at every restaurant listed , and it must be reissued each year . If any such guide exists in the United States , we are not aware of it . P222As for the slick food and travel magazines ? even those that do not require the restaurants they praise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If you ca n't boost , do n't knock . Faithful to this rule is Gourmet . A sample : " ... for the most part the food at Sardi 's is more than creditable , and it occasionally reaches an exalted level . " Actually , for the most part the food at Sardi 's is less than creditable , and it is Gourmet 's prose that is exalted . As the writer doubtless knew . The wife of one well-known professional blurted to us one evening , " You 're lucky ? you can criticize ! " That cry from the heart ( or palate ? ) was not , unfortunately , typical . How the trade views itself was faithfully related by Sutton in a food issue of The Saturday Review/World . In his essay , Sutton leaned heavily on the wisdom of Beard , whom he described as " the doyen of America 's burgeoning food fraternity . " The preference for the fancy French " doyen " over the plain English " dean " is of course typical of the fraternity , just as Beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planters , and Restaurant Associates proves his talent , according to Sutton . " In the American fraternity , " he writes , " no one has less than a kind word for Jim Beard . " Although we are not fraternity members , we too have a kind word : of the three dominant figures in the gourmet biz ? Child , Claiborne , and Beard ? only Beard seems from his work actuallyto enjoy cooking and to write well about it . But as a former actor , he does n't mind appearing in commercials , and has absorbed some of their ethos . A food lover who writes , as he does , that iceberg lettuce is " maligned and mistreated " and has " good flavor and interesting texture " simply can not be trusted . It is only fair to warn the reader that the authors may be prejudiced . In addition to calling the honest San Francisco critic Jack Shelton willfully destructive and saying that Gault and Millau " too often ... go ass over teakettle about something , " the Sutton-Beard piece tookp223a swipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , who , it said , " is accused of being influenced by his wife . " ( The accusation , although anonymous , is correct. ? J.L.H. ) We quote the following passage , at once flattering and insulting , only to make a general point : " John Hess wrote brilliantly from Paris , but thrust into the prestigious fishbowl food berth in New York , he is , in the words of one senior member of the fraternity , in a puddle he does n't know how to swim out of . ' In Sutton 's puddle or fishbowl , as the case may be , touting fancy grub is a large social cut above foreign correspondence . His columns on such varied subjects as finding edible wild roots in New York and farming Chinese vegetables in New Jersey are offbeat and interesting , but there are those who claim that he is too conditioned to France and to French restaurants to defend American fare properly . " It is not clear here that " to defend American fare " in Sutton-Beard 's view means to praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doubt . Beginning his piece with the salivating notion of Gael Greene that " food and sex are completely interwoven anthropologicallv , " Sutton tells us : " Europe and the Orient developed sophisticated cultures embracing both sensualities . But the settlers who came to the New World were too busy with basic needs to bother about the niceties . In America , food initially was a matter of survival ; later , it was little more than a function . " Sutton abandons without explanation the problem of how the settlers procreated ? presumably , not in a sophisticated manner . ( Actually , the carryings on of some of the Virginia gentry , as recorded in diaries and lawsuits , were depraved enough to have interested even Gael Greene . ) He continues : " It was not until the end of World War II , says James Beard , ... that Americans began to think of eating as a pleasurable thing , a sensual delight . " ' Thanks to returningGI 's and tourists and , of course , to the burgeoningP224food fraternity , " The kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embark on new cooking experiments at home . Restaurateurs were encouraged to forsake steak and potatoes for heavy forays into the world of snails and highfalutin sauces . " That is defending American fare ? That is only Beard-Boorstin history , a farrago of errors that insult our intelligence , our scholarship , and our forebears . We repeat : the earliest settlers , and the Indians before them , had a marvelous array of foods to choose from , and developed sophisticated and sensual ways of handling them . The foods were gradually homogenized by the Industrial Revolution , and good American cooking was gradually supplanted by the gourmet plague . Finally , the Pepsi generation of gourmet writers taught Americansto be ashamed of their own great food heritage . As for restaurateurs , although few have actually forsakensteak and potatoes , most have betrayed them : the beef is usually frozen , tenderized " so you can eat it with a fork , " and tasteless ; the potatoes are either precooked frozen French fries ( the gourmets love ' em ) , or Idahos ? one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil , a gourmet imbecility that leaves them slightly steamed instead of deliciously mealy and crispskinned . The foiled spud is served with a shiny synthetic or superpasteurized " sour cream " and a sophisticated salad of James Beard 's iceberg lettuce and cotton tomato , drowned in a sweet " Russian " or " French " dressing to lend them taste . The entree is accompanied by sweet buns , and the whole is " washed down " with an iced sweet drink of cola or tea or coffee or , more pretentiously , Sangria . From the late eighteenth century , it is true , American restaurants of pretension tried to follow the new French model , offering enormous menus of elaborate dishes . This posed the double handicap of requiring large staffs of skilled help and large supplies of fine foodstuffs . A skim through " Oscar " of the Waldorf 's Cook Book shows thatp225the talent for haute cuisine was seldom there , although good cooking was still common in America in his time . Oscar Tschirky , who dominated the gourmet scene in New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact not a cook but a headwaiter . He began in Delmonico 's , which , Boorstin grandly asserts , " set a standard for New York gourmets which by the mid-twentieth century made that city , next to Paris , the restaurant capital of the world . " Save the mark ! In On the Town in New York , Michael and Ariane Batterberry say that Oscar " was a punctilious gourmet and so hidebounda snob that he claimed he would rather see Mrs. Astor sipping hot water in the Palm Garden than a namelessnouveau riche devouring a ten-course dinner . " Oscar 's cookbook is an incompetent caricature of haute cuisine ; its only value is to demonstrate that the present generationof gourmet frauds originated nothing . Snobbery and the cult of a misunderstood French elegance have always been with us . As for the foodstuffs , they evidently suffered not only from progress but from the very nature of the food business . Jovan Trboyevic , proprietor of Le Perroquet , one of the better restaurants in Chicago , explained to us : There is a built-in staleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B and C of something , the oldest must be served first . " This is a curse of the fish and produce trades as well . It would seem to follow that restaurants should keep their menus short . Instead , they stock up , relying oil the freezer and the refrigerator to eliminate waste . When we complimented a New York restaurateur one Wednesday on a dish of fresh whiting , he told us complacentlythat he had bought enough to see him through the weekend . Trboyevic , incidentally , is an alumnus of the Swiss hotel school ( the Ecole Hoteliere in Lausanne ) that Claiborne attended , but he does not call himself a cook . Claiborne has called it " the best cooking school in the world .

Young camper people were livingmy spectaculars circuit from Kentucky to Louisiana in a parodyversion of society 's always-just-coming or always-just-going thing . My Louisville " hotel " was an apartment building called The Adams House , converted for Derby Week full occupancy and fast turnover . Its doors were kept locked , guarded by a uniformed trooper with loaded gun . When I asked about the armor , I was told that during past Derby weeks , drunks and others had been known to rush a building and use its toilets , its towels , its beds . To get in , one had to sound one 's name through a locked door and hope someone would turn up and open .

" The night before the Kentucky Derby I was supposed to meet Ron Turcotte , Riva Ridge 's jockey , and some New York Racing Commission people , but in the jam of traffic and communication we never made contact . I traced Turcotte to a restaurant , called him ; the hostess said she would page him , forgot , and left the phone off the hook .

Everyone stood about five feet high , some an inch less , some inches more , many with George Raft sharplyparted hair , sharplycut dark sideburns , a few with afros . A couple of tousledlighthaired guys like Turcotte looked out of place in the room . In the heat of day , these small grown men wore bathrobes , like movie extras in hopes of a call . Or stretchy T-shirts , like kitchen boys trying to avoid a call . Their pants , though , were uniformly white , shiny , plastic , and their boots , black or dark brown , had the tops cuffed over . On the wall pegs and in valet rooms , jockey silks showed in profusion . It was a Dufy scene .

The Great Steamboat Race between the Belle and the Delta Queen of Cincinnati , this at twenty-five dollars per couple . With cigarette advertising cut out of television , Philip Morris , and Marlboro ( its bestselling label ) , moved in wherever the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-dollar " chuckwagon breakfast " which added southern grits to the usual western offering of flapjacks , eggs , bacon , sausage , ham . These Festival events were open to thep36public , but the calendar also listed events with admission " By Invitation , " foremost among these the Derby Festival Queen 's CoronationBall ( sponsored by a women 's charitable organization called " The Fillies " ) . Not listed at all were the Derby society parties , the Kentucky equivalent of the before and after New York Opera parties . A couple of other affairs were designated " By Invitation , " a Knights of Columbus Derby Dinner and " Ad Club Day at the Races , " sponsored by the Advertising Club of Louisville through its special men 's group called " The Thorobreds . " More socially and politically significant were two events sponsored by the powerfulKentucky Colonels organization ; " By Invitation " one could get to their dinner on Derby eve , or to their daylong barbecue the Sunday after the race . The year 1972 was not a good one for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Kentuckygovernor , Wendell H. Ford , to Senator Ed Muskie when polls showed Muskie leading not only his Democratic rivals but the incumbent , Richard M. Nixon . Then some of Mr. Nixon 's friends went to work on Muskie . By May " dirty tricks " had wiped out Senator Muskie , but Wendell Ford 's , and the Colonels ' , invitationwas not withdrawn . I remembered a similar incident at Williams College : Williams ' president , Jim Baxter , had pulled off a brilliant coup , he thought , by getting an early commitment from Thomas E. Dewey , the guaranteednext President of the United States , to be the college 's 1949 commencement speaker . But the Senator Muskie who arrived in Louisville had n't even made it into the finals . Muskie was n't the Colonels ' only unfortunate pick : for some reason the organization had decided to present Danny Thomas as their featured entertainer . Thomas 's success was roughly equal to Muskie 's , or so the Courier-Journal report of the Colonels ' dinnerseemed to suggest : An impassioned plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainer Danny Thomas , who , afterdelivering jokes tirelessly for about 30 minutes , brought some 750 persons to their feet at Convention Center to sing , " America the Beautiful . "  |p37The  reporter could n't completely hide her own ( or the affair 's ) general depression and gamely assured her readers that " the eveningwas n't all one of sober considerations . " II . SOCIETYThe year 's most stylish social shut-out , the kind of thing F. Scott Fitzgerald might have considered too improbable as fiction , was scored by the C. V. Whitneys , who chose as their guest-of-DerbyWeekone of New York 's then Beautiful People , Marion Javits ( who brought along her Senator husband , Jacob ) . Only one social element was seemingly barred from the Whitney party , or , at best , sparsely represented ? Kentucky locals . The Whitneys were hosting a huge Derby party at Churchill Downs race day , but gave their exclusive society party in Lexington , on their horse farm , not walking distance from Churchill Downs . To make sure the party would stay exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family jet , just as , in earlier days , the stately manse on the east or west bank of the Hudson River used trains to haul in socially registered houseguests . Starred along with Marion Javits was C. V. Whitney 's cousin , Joan ? the late Mrs. Charles S. Payson ? then owner of New York 's baseball Mets . Mrs. Payson , an operalover as well as a society superstar , had given her Mets the very best New York social name . Baseball was Mrs. Payson 's third-best charity . She owned the Greentree Farm Stable in her cousin C.V . ' s Lexington . The Whitneys had that grand society talent for converting any turf into one 's own . Lexington , Kentucky , soon resembled a floatingchunk of New York 's Sutton Place . Mrs. C. V. Whitney made one quiet concession to Kentucky , however : her menu listed a regionalfavorite , Kentucky corn grits souffle . Her party was an updated Jay Gatsby dream , with 112 guests seated in the Whitneys ' atrium and a smaller table of twenty set up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spring party motif , Mrs. Whitney creatively chose an artificialbirdtheme . Every table had its own stuffed cardinals , American goldfinches , doves , and/or owls motionlessly perched alongsideP38tall cages filled with real , not artificial , flowers . In case any of the guests retained a little Zelda Fitzgerald zip and might want to dive into the family swimmingpool , Mrs. Whitney offered discouragementin the form of floating swans made of pristinely white mums and Christmas-y twinklelights . A cheery yellow-and-white marquee decorated with wisteria-covered arbors , weepingwillow trees , and little house plants connected Mrs. Whitney 's atrium ( where Cliff Hall 's Palm Beach orchestra made socially proper Meyer Davis-Lester Lanin sounds ) to a vista of Kentucky bluegrass . To make certain that people who were n't invited would know they were n't invited , Eugenia Sheppard , the society columnist , was invited to write about who was invited . Mrs. Whitney herself got home just in time for the Derby , it seems , by interrupting her Tour season in Spain , where she , and equally committed friends , were . reconstructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , with the help of the director of the Prado , restoringthem . The walled city was close to a modern city , which had been given the name of Generalissimo Franco 's greatest admirer , Trujillo . Mrs. Whitney in a pre-party interview explained that the only obstacle to the old walled city becoming itself a kind of Prado was " what we might call squatters in this country , who live among the ruins . " She evidently had n't yet heard of the originalTrujillo 's solution to squatters in Dominican Republic slums : warnings , bulldozers , and dynamite . Derby Day everyone , not just Mrs. Whitney , seemed to be havinga party . Hippies , jocks , holy rollers , hookers , Kentucky Colonels , admen , sodalities , sororities , fraternities . Breakfast parties began early . Governor Ford himself invited about a thousand guests , who had to eat in four separate shifts . Breakfast organized social clusters which remained together the rest of the day , turning into lunch parties , picnics , dinner parties . Clubhouse tables were booked years ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were consideredlifetime commitments . A " good table " at Churchill Downs was another register of someone 's social Dow Jones . Infield parties , too , were well organized . At Epsom Downs for The Derby , the crowd seemed to consist of village friends , pubP39friends , and , more common , families . In Kentucky , blankets spread under fraternity and sorority banners recreated for the Derby a spirit of clubby Panhellenic close-out to demonstrate that the American campus was still safe from democracy . III . THE MEDIAUp in the press box , some of the old Derby hands had already blocked out their stories . They allowed for chance , should chance in some way affect the Derby running . The set story ran something like this : Table One turfwriter had prepared five possible leads the night before the race . The fact that one horse was favored over the rest of the field ? Riva Ridge at overnight odds of 8 ? 5 ? perhaps suggested this pre-write . The writer told me , however , that he , never went to a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do one of five things 99% of the time . In rare instances a favorite may stumble and throw its jockey . Such acts of God deserved a fresh writing . He assured me that with only a touch-up here and there his prewritten models were what he almost always filed . He used the time saved , he said , at the bar . IV . THE SCENEIn May , morning shadows are sharp black cut-outs . A lover of shadows like the blind writer Borges , were he still able to see , could have spent Derby Day watching the brightly striped milepole'sshadow . It shortened till noon , acting as a sundial . A gray haze then hung in the sky ; the infield 's deepspring green shone in contrast . That infield was mini-Epsom , lacking only Epsom'smidway rides . A rock band up on a small infield platform seemed as isolated as a circus sideshow . Singers gyrated , the band grooved , but nobody was watching . Children made red , green , black , yellow disks and dots on the infield green . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools lolled on the grass . Fairfield Senior High had placed its bright red school flags on the hedges ; they looked like the U.S.S.R. 's . That spring of ' 72 , a huge security detail manned the roofs above the infield . Soldiers , national guardsmen , local police , track securitymen seemed everywhere . Less obvious were civilians in CIA shades and FBI double-o glasses . Olive drab contrasted withp41the crowd 's primary colors . Did Churchill Downs expect a blackwhiteriot ? An antiwar demonstration ? A Fort Lauderdale orgy ? Armed , uniformed men represented one half of an American allegory , halfnaked young people in the infield represented the other half , those all-but-disappeared flower people who had vanished into commune or collective hills and ravines . As the afternoon advanced , picnics ended , the bands put their uniforms back on , the pompom girls stretched and primped . Chaperoning parents , who had been serving food , left . Instruments tuned with riffs , fanfares , jazz bursts . Once up , everybody was ready to go . The all-white Fairfield High band and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Male High , who were next to a slightly " mixed " band from Thomas Jefferson High . The long , thin Male High drum major was stylishly degage in a white beret and gold vest : his lead drummer wore his hair in a wild afro and covered his eyes with applegreen put-on bubble sunglasses . In the infield six or seven kids rotating on a blanket salaamed faster and faster . Communal joints were passed . Those who dragged deepest fell back zonked-out , prone . Others who seemed to have been tripping would presumably see a Derby for pterodactyls . Veteran dealers kept their backs to the roofed soldiery and peddled pills and pot like popcorn . The counterculture did its thing eye-level with the Silent Majority . Sororities and fraternities entertained the odd smoker , but , on the whole , loyal to America , featured Fort Lauderdale jocks loudly baying for beer . V. FRANCHISESLooking at the band , the pompom girls , the trippers , the smokers , the beerguzzlers , the Boone 's Farm drunkards , I thought of the 1970s word which covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ; Kentucky had sent out fried chicken franchises to multiply and prosper . Franchising was the American landscape 's Act of Uniformity . The buildings and merchandise were always the same . Employees were interchangeable . A uniform McDonald 's , Midas Mufflers , Howard Johnson 's were independent of regional American uniqueness .   Not only food but fun was franchised and programmed . The Derby parade , the Indianapolis " 500 " parade , the Rose Bowl parade , the Mardi Gras parade were almost totally franchised . Music came out of Central Arranging ; so did marching-band strategies ? wheeling , sleeving , weaving , reversing . Descriptions were franchised . Themes were franchised . What the Beatles did in the early 1960s , once commercially co-opted , became franchised Arthur Fiedler Boston Pops and marching-band arrangements . Franchising is best explained by a formula : in areas of North America that have never seen a Mexican , for example , a taco franchisewill be bought by someone who has never tasted a tostada , an enchilada , a tamale , a taco , or even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ton of ingredients , and a sheet , with instructions to take a tortilla out of a can ( luckily labeled " tortilla " ) , heat it this number of minutes , add one-half ounce meat from the can labeled " meat , " one-half ounce cheese from the package labeled " cheese , " etc . Franchising does the same for marching bands , sousaphonists , drum majors , pompom girls . A Norman Vincent Peale franchising service distributes sheets of nondenominational or varidenominational sermons . The franchised instruction sheet for marching bands says take about thirty drummers , add about thirty trumpets , twenty trombones , twenty clarinets , twenty saxophones , ten tubas , six sousaphones , four glockenspiels , four cymbalists , one drum major , and ? pouf ! ? tacos . The Fairfield High girls at the Derby used a few audibles to keep their plays together ; the formula said onetwothree bump ( chastely ) , onetwothree grind ( chastely ) , grin , anklediddle to the left , anklediddle to the right , turn in chaste cancan , flash panties , face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In their franchised patriotic climax , the girls unfurled a fortyfoot flag . Almost out of sight , in the backstretch , grooms and exercise boys led horses out for the pre-Derby races . Curried colts and fillies reared in track dirt . Some , in a sweat , seemed stained , dark , shining . Without numbers to mark them , without differentiating racing colors , or jockeys , the horses seemed pastoral , ahistorical in the surrounding track dirt and green . Around the stables , nothing was plastic or franchised . Realp43horses switched real tails at real flies . Horses stretched , stood still , or nibbled real grass . At dawn , waking horses whinnied as if Derby Day were a first under the sun . In the middle of programmed Festival fun and social hype , the horses , and the men and women around them , stood their ground , asserting the primary , the actual , the real . VI . PASTIMESLooking at the Fort Lauderdale jocks now flopped out on their groundsheets , zonked , or feigning , I thought of Breughel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreadeagled scholar with swollen codpiecestares up at the sky ; a farmer , his flail pitched aside , is sleeping ; a knight has dropped his lance , and his Sancho Panza . A pig moves with a knife threaded through its hide , as if someone fell asleep in mid-skinning . Something more than theme or moral is on Breughel 's canvas ? gesture , with shape , color , is humanly there . So it was in Louisville . The unspontaneous , the lax , the boring togetherbecame something different . The bands , the Fort Lauderdales , the Hare Krishnaites and Jesus people picking their way among the fallen Derby revelers , the hip and the square created an infield of games , circuses , and pastimes . Sober John Milton digressed from epic theology to describe bad angels playing at ordinaryhuman games . Froissart interrupted a serious allegory to detail the sixty games he used to play as a child in Valenciennes . Breughel 's " Children 's Games " is an acting-out catalogue of pastimes ; and Rabelais , as part of Gargantua 's growing-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Indianapolis " 500 , " the Flamingo Park and Convention Center games in Miami Beach , watching the Rose Bowl and Mardi Gras , I changed my attitude toward pastimes . I began to understand how important they were for sustaining life . Man , I began to see , lives not by bread alone ; humankind also lives by circuses . Rabelais has Gargantua play his medieval and Renaissance games ? almost all of which , I realized , I was seeing , in modern form , on the Derby 's infield green ? and later , in Indianapolis , Miami Beach , Pasadena , New Orleans . Almost anyone canP44translate Rabelais ' games into what she or he plays , played , or has seen played : TableP45In the stands and in the various spectacular site infields the recognizablegames analogous to Gargantua 's were : TableIn the Kentucky Derby infield I was reminded many times of Gargantua , who , when he had " well played , shuffled , clogged , and thrown away his time , . . . thought fit to drink a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sleep . . . . " //P46VII . THE EVENTIn the clubhouse and press area the serious pastime was drinking . The infield was deeded watery juleps and Boone 's Farm wine ; classic drinkers were on pure Bourbon and branch water . One guy , an unsouthern Montrealer , was a sobbing Bourbon drunk three hours before the race . " Man , " he announced to the press box , " it 's beautiful Mickey Mouse ? in the world 's entire history I give you twenty to one there 's never been anything more pure Mickey Mouse . I love it . I love it ? I go straight home every year and tell my little old mother how everybody cries singing Kentucky Home , ' and she cries . Fourteen years . Everytime I swear it 's going to be my everlovin ' last , but man , when they play that My Old Kentucky Home , ' I 'm up on my feet , crying and singing . " As the day warmed , spaced-out smokers frazzled beside fraternity-sororityfolk loudly harmonizing Glenn Miller nostalgics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clustered together near the fence around the parking lot , as if that space , assigned to them years ago , had been little affected by court decisions . A few small dice games were in progress . Younger kids were having fun pitching nickels close to a wall . In Louisville , in Indianapolis , in Pasadena , side-betting for nickels , dimes , and dollars livens a spectacular . Pools are big . Amounts bet can run from a dime to several hundred or even thousand dollars . The exact order of finish ? three horses , four , the entirefield ? was the basis of one kind of Derby pool ; there was inbettingbased on the winning horse 's two furlong , four furlong , six furlong , etc. fractions with penalty points assigned to each missed one fifth of a second . Time pools at Indianapolis , on the other hand , were based on the first ten finishers estimated to the 1/1,000th of a second . Huge Rose Bowl pools fixed on the exact time of the first touchdown , of the last touchdown , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variations . Compared to what was happening on the Derby tote board , Churchill Downs pool betting was paltry . One can roughly esti-P47mate the handle of a good American track on a stakes day by multiplyingthe attendance by $100-$130 . The Derby , which has the heaviest total betting action of any race in the country , does n't come close to the expected figure ( multiplying its " estimated " attendanceby , say , $100 ) . Obviously , then , the Derby attracts at least 40,000 to 50,000 token bettors , and people who do n't bet at all . The Derby , unlike other " big " horse races , is heavily attended by people who just want to be there , do n't want to bet , and have little interest in any specific horse winning . The low per capita bettingfigure of around sixty dollars a head also indicates that the Derby attracts a far younger and far older crowd than most other American stakes races . The very young and very old do n't go in much for betting . The Belmont Stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated ( fifteen miles out of Manhattan , and on the edge of Long Island 's heavily populated Nassau County ) , has never come closer than a distant second to the Derby attendance in recent years . Its best attendance figure is always 40,000 ? 60,000 shy of the Derby 's ; yet its betting , working out to the predicted multiple of $100 ? $130 per patron , falls only a few hundredthousand shy of the Derby record . At five o'clock , half an hour before the big race , that Derby bettingaction became very heavy . Riva Ridge , 8 ? 5 on the morning line , went down , then up , never higher than 2-1 . Hold Your Peace was next at 7 ? 2 , No Le Hace right behind at 4 ? 1 : the " field " lumping was fourth at 8 ? 1 ? mostly because Canonero II , a 1971 " field " entry , had won the Derby at $19.40 for every twodollarbet . Just after five , sun broke through the haze , penetrating the mists over distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crowd below the press box moved closer to the rail . Infield lollers woke or were poked awake . Goodnatured shoving and squirming followed at the infield fences . Churchill Downs looked like an early nineteenth-century tinted etching of itself . The track outriders in their red coats were picture-cardDickens . The outrider horses , dark and stifflegged , looked oversized , formal , not of this time . Kentucky 's breeding farms add significance to Churchill Downs and the Derby . As much as the Keeneland Yearling Sales and theP48August auctions at Saratoga , Derby time generates spring horse talk , offers to sell , promises to come see . Breeding farms are locatedon the edges of Churchill Downs . When one looks out from a beautiful plant like New York 's Belmont Park , one sees what Aubrey Beardsley called America 's " beautiful dreck " ? suburban schlock guaranteed to obliterate the pastoral . New York 's Aqueduct overlooks JFK Airport , and shares JFK 's screeching flight pattern . Every other American track suffers airplanes , but Aqueduct is constantly under the shadow of massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a city , but seems only an extension of open grass country . Its pastoral setting is perfect for the Derby 's secondary role as the American horsebreeder 's spectacular . The list of Derby winnersis dominated by horses bred in Kentucky , not very far from Churchill Downs . So , too , for other unrestricted major stakes : the Preakness , for instance , and the Belmont . Riva Ridge , 1972 's favorite , was bred in Kentucky by Meadow Farms , Christopher Chenery 's stable ( in 1972 , and after , managed by his daughter , Penny Tweedy ) . Mrs. Tweedy entered her box early , shortly after five , when $463,000 had already been bet on Riva Ridge 's nose , and the Montreal guy was well into his third Bourbon hour . " Listen , " he shouted to nobody in particular , " get ready . When they play My 01 ' Kentucky Home ' every one of you cynical sonof-a-bitchesis going to feel your spine turn into an icicle . " In the infield the Fairfield High pompom girls raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tweedy , watching them , seemed cool . Her dress was Meadow Stable 's racing blue and silver-white , in polkadot compared with her jockey 's checkerboard pattern . All over the infield the barechested and barebacked were having blobs of white Noxzema applied to inflamed sunburnt places . Out cold on blankets and groundsheets , some celebrants would clearly not make it up to watch this Derby . Kids climbed on parental shoulders . A few little children were held on stepladders . A peculiarpre-rain stillness settled over the crowd . The quiet was broken only by the urgent last-minute cry , " Juleps , full-up ! " Owners left their boxes for the saddling-up ritual in the pad-P49dock . Little Lucien Laurin , Meadow Stable 's trainer , was adjusting Riva Ridge 's cinch strap and giving jockey Ron Turcotte lastminuteorders . Bending forward , clasping fingers , cupping , he gave Turcotte an easy leg-up into the saddle . When the first fanfare blew for the horses to come onto the track , $2,700,000 had been bet on the Derby , over half a million of that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with singing quite restrained , but the first note of " My Old Kentucky Home " sent a roar over the stands and infield . A national ritual was being observed , and celebrated . As the horses moved on to the track , Mrs. Tweedy hurried back to her box , smiled at several nearby people who waved a good luck wish her way . Having a horse in the Derby is an achievement all by itself . Many horse owners and breeders never come up with a contending horse to run in the Derby . Bad luck eliminated Hoist the Flag , one of the most promising two-year-olds in recent racing history ( who broke a leg but was n't destroyed because of his stud value ) . Hoist the Flag would have been a Derby favorite ; another contender slow to mature , Key to the Mint , the Rokeby Stable 's **26;1561;TOOLONG in 1972 , just could n't train up for the 1972 Kentucky Derby . In the middle of the field , slowly parading , was Mrs. Tweedy 's Riva Ridge ( named after an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Tweedy , had fought ) . On Riva Ridge 's saddlecloth was a lucky devil 's red " 7 , " his program number for the Derby . Ron Turcotte sat quite still , calmly talking to George Davis , the Meadow Stable lead rider . When Davis finally let go , Riva Ridge eased into a canter , loping , then changed to what track charts call " breezing . " Turcotte separated Riva Ridge from the rest of the field , slowing down , then walking this smallish dark horse that Mrs. Tweedy called " funny ears " ( unlike her huge handsome charismatic Secretariat , Riva Ridge 's younger stablemate , who , at this point in 1972 , had not raced ) . Unhurried , Turcotte headed toward the starting gate , his blue and white silks sparkling against the far green hedges . Turcotte had been first in the 1965 Preakness on Tom Rolfe for his only win in Triple Crown racing . Turcotte had made his commitment to Riva Ridge early ? a whole year earlier ? on a clay when his most successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her last race . Mike Freeman , Shuvee 's trainer , who had called Shuvee " Ron 's horse , " understood Turcotte choosing Riva Ridge : Turcotte'seye , in 1971 , was already on the 1972 Kentucky Derby . Several months before the Derby , in the Everglades , Riva Ridge , outrun at the start , and bounced around , lost . Turcotte was n't going to let that happen again . The moment the field broke out of the gate he raced Riva Ridge hard to the first turn , then dropped in on the rail a length and a half in front . T'urcotte 's hands were down low , a sign his horse was running easy . Raised up out of the saddle , head up , Turcotte seemed to be measuring the distance between Riva Ridge and the second horse , Hold Your Peace , as if he wanted the solid safety of that intervening space . Once Hold Your Peace feinted a run at Riva Ridge , but Turcotte was n't buying . Again Hold Your Peace spurted , and still Turcotte held his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold Your Peace made its move ; Turcotte looked back , tightened his reins , and Riva Ridge responded with a rush . As the racing charts would sum it up , Hold Your Peace was quickly " disposed of . " In the stretch , No Le Hace skidded into contention like a little kid chasing a missed bus . By the time No Le Hace righted himself , Riva Ridge was winner . Mrs. Tweedy was up and cheering , hugging elfin Laurin , a man who would be perfectly cast as a pixie uncle in a French-Canadian TV series . Winners sparkle on the tip of an iceberg , losers glubglub in the murky deathclimes below : Ron Turcotte , with Riva Ridge 's win , began an incredible string of Triple Crown victories ? winning five of a possible six races , all for Mrs. Tweedy and Lucien Laurin . Mrs. Tweedy , by winning the 1972 Derby , turned the fortunes of Meadow Stable right around . In 1971 and early 1972 , Meadow Stable was having financial problems : Upper Case , Riva Ridge , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretariat , changed everything . Secretariat was syndicated out for $6,080,000 . Her 1972 Derby winner , Riva Ridge , was syndicated for $3,000,000 ? this in addition to their purse earnings . The Churchill Downs pressroom the moment Riva Ridge wonP51looked like party headquarters for a victorious political candidate . Reporters crowded the podium set up for Mrs. Tweedy . Lucien Laurin joined her , and , eventually , a freshly showered , dressed-up Ron Turcotte . Post-race press conferences , like a Boston Pops summer concert , are quite predictable . This one included the followingquestions : Q. to someone who has just won the Kentucky Derby forthe first time Is this your biggest thrill in racing ? Q. At any point in the race did you think your horse mightnot make it ? Q. Is this the best horse you have ever owned ? Mrs. Tweedy , smiling widely and waving a silver stirrup cup , reminded everyone that some reporters had suggested she run Upper Case , who had won the Wood Memorial in New York , and not Riva Ridge , in the Derby . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that settles , " said Mrs. Tweedy , hoisting her stirrup cup , " the question of whether we had the wrong horse in the race . " The press gang cheered . After Mrs. Tweedy answered the usual questions , Lucien Laurin stepped up . The contrast between him and Mrs. Tweedy pointed up the social meaning of the Derby spectacular . Penny Tweedy belonged to the clubhouse and trustees ' world ? the society circuit ; Lucien Laurin was part of the backstretch world . A few weeks later , when I was in Baltimore for the Preakness and talking with Elliott Burch , trainer for Rokeby Stable , owned by multimillionaire socialite Paul Mellon , a reporter interrupted to ask Burch , " How does Mellon feel about Key to the Mint ? " " Mister Mellon , " Burch said ? I think the put-down word for his tone is " icily . " If trainers were not the social equals of owners , then neither were newspaperpeople . During the big race , or other sporting event , class striations may be ignored ? temporarily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Saratoga are class segregated , so , too , the Derby . Owners and socialites generally are allowed twenty-four hours to mingle with those out there . The model ob- served at the Kentucky Derby travels all over the country ? upperclass , middleclass , steerage ? a great land ship temporarily touched down at a spectacular , but , in essence , a vestige of those luxury liners which carried America 's class structure intact from social New York to social Europe , and back . Two weeks later , during the Preakness , in Baltimore , the social compact was the same one observed in Louisville and New York . Here were the jockeys , trainers , backstretch workers , differentiated from one another only by success ? i.e. money . The jockeys drove Mercedes or Cadillacs , Lincoln , Imperials , and the successful trainers , for the most part , did , too . The odd jock or trainer even went in for the Bentley or Rolls-Royce , in imitation of their social betters , the owners . But no jockey or trainer in 1972 imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the way into society ? old or new . That kind of social breakthrough might have been possible ? or imagined possible ? in Fitzgerald 's day . Post-race parties in Baltimore were as exclusive as the C. V. Whitney Lexingtonparty . The New York ? Boston ? St. Paul rule of " one 's own kind only " was observed . The Preakness ? unintentionally , I know ? pointed up the success of the Kentucky Derby as racing 's number one spectacular . Baltimore'sa big city , Washington and Philadelphia are n't that far away , nor , for that matter , is New York City , and yet the Preakness did n't even approach the Derby 's attendance ( or its bettinghandle ) . Key to the Mint added class absent in the Derby field . Riva Ridge was now interesting as a possible Triple Crown winner . Yet Pimlico race track on an admittedly unpleasant wet gray day could only come up with an attendance announced as 48,000 ( and which , to me , looked lighter than 35,000 ) . The contrastwith the Derby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered-indoors Mrs. Tweedy was gay and confident ; outside rain was falling . By eight in the evening Baltimore was covered in mist ; midnight , the air was thick , liquid . ' The track was pocked with pools and ponds . By noon the track was officially rated " sloppy . " Nobody wanted to use nasty but more accurate words like " emulsive , " " soupy , " or " oozy . " PimlicoP53on Preakness Day would have been a great setting for a film on Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow . By post-time for the first race the infield looked deserted , as though the track were officially dark for the day . A few stubborn people huddled under umbrellas , hunched up in raincoats . It was cold and nasty . A rock group boogied on a tiny infield stage . Any comparison with Louisville was uncompromisingly invidious . The track turned to a brown gunk , like soggy toffee . After the first race several people tried to ignore the track footing and cross over to the infield . One man found his shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like John of the nursery rhyme ) and perched like a stork , waiting for rescue . A rubberbooted attendant slogged in , freed the lost shoe bearded with mud . A few gallants , instead of spreading their coats uselessly on the mucky water , grabbed up stranded women , who with a sudden flash of thigh broke Pimlico 's cast of solid gray . Between races the track 's outriders on their dripping wet horses splashed around the track spraying water like rain . The rail position , sometimes preferred under sloppy track conditions , rippled in the wind like a shallow canal . On the far outside , rain welled up dangerous pools . Just before the Preakness , a horse called Smokey Johnny , cuttingin to that usually drier rail spot , skidded suddenly , was pulled up , skidded again , slamming into the rail , throwing its rider and snapping its foreleg . It loosed a shrieking cry high above the shocked crowd 's groan . Its rider had been thrown free , and was unhurt . The horse stood motionless , the rain still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of control . A horse ambulancechurned up through the mud ; track attendants gently tried to load the horse aboard . Pain made the horse scream out again , louder , a terrifying cry that hung in the air over the horses coming out on the track for the Preakness . A local horse , Bee Bee Bee , a long shot ridden by a small-time jockey familiar with Pimlico mud , heat Riva Ridge , beat Key to the Mint , beat ' em all . Mrs. Tweedy 's dream of a 1972 Triple Crown was over . Rain only partly explained why the Kentucky Derby overshadowed the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes . When I got on an Amtrak Metroliner in New York 's Penn Station to go top54Baltimore , the contrast between the Preakness and the Derby was instantly apparent . No lines in New York , no excited talk about " the race . " My car was n't even full . A husband and wife , unconcernedabout the Preakness , were trying to follow a Mets baseball game on a transistor with lousy batteries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-year-old gent I had somehow missed meeting in Louisville . The old turfwriter was full of racing tales about " niggers " and " guineas . " The Kentucky Derby was clearly in a class by itself , and , from all indications , pretty sure to remain so . Years of studying the Derby 's success formula had not produced for any other larger , wealthier track a racing spectacular to threaten the Derby . Three Saturdays after the Preakness , as I watched Riva Ridge win the Belmont Stakes in New York , the New York Mets were at home in Shea Stadium , and drew a crowd as large as Belmont 's . Macy 's and Gimbel 's each probably had as many horseplayers in their respective stores as turned up for the Belmont . Belmont had its own " Sidewalks of New York " signature to put up against " My Old Kentucky Home , " but otherwise did n't make it . New York was perhaps just too cool for a sports spectacular . In Kentucky the Derby is the Day of the year , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakes race on the New York Racing Association calendar . In a year when a horse has won the Derby and the Preakness and a Triple Crown is possible , the Belmont picks up added interest . In 1973 , with Secretariat running and winning the Triple Crown , interest could not have been higher . Yet compare Riva Ridge 's or Secretariat 's Kentucky Derby with Secretariat 's Triple Crown-winning Belmont Stakes as a spectacular and the Derby in both years comes out far ahead . The Belmont Stakes that Secretariat won was the most dramatic race I have ever seen ; Riva Ridge 's Derby win was fairly ordinary . The one and only great American racing spectacular quite obviously was the Kentucky Derby . In the year I saw Riva Ridge 's winning Derby and Belmont ( and losing Preakness ) , I watched the filly Triple Crown ( the Acorn , Mother Goose , and Coaching Club American Oaks run in New York ) , the Wood Memorial , the Suburban , the Jockey Club Gold Cup , all , again , run in New York . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian racing spectacular , at Toronto 's Woodbine track ? and perhaps a dozen other $100 , 000 ? or higher ? stakes races . The Derby was unthreatened by them all : wherever I went , if the Kentucky Derby were mentioned , someone was sure to say either , " Oh , I 've been to the Derby , " or , " That 's one thing I really want to do before 1 die ? see a Kentucky Derby . " Nobody said the same thing about the Preakness or the Belmont ; even in Canada , the Derby meant more than the older Canadian Queen 's Plate . Again , people who wanted to go somewhere special , or do something special , thought of the Derby as that special thing . The politicians , entertainment people , business executives , society leaders who used the Derby as stage paralleled the business organizationswho used the Derby as reward . Anyone selling the most cars , or tires , could not only brag about attending the Derby but know that the person bragged to shared the Derby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American spectaculars . In the American " deal , " an interdependence exists between bread and circuses . The teleology of work is , over an entire life , " betterment " ; during any one year the sharper goad is " enjoyment . " People set their calendars for vacations to coincide with the Derby , the Indianapolis " 500 , " Mardi Gras . The calendar is marked off week by week ? much in the same way that people count down to birthdays . America , in addition , is hyped on " firsts " ? the first kiss , the first car , the first sexual experience , the first house . People also rank " my biggest " this , or " most exciting " that . The Kentucky Derby is a recognized American objective , a special place to be at a most particular time , a Mount Everest , which , " because it is there , " has to be experienced . Killjoy Gertrude Stein said , " What if when we get there we find no there there ? " Muttery muttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an importantAmerican need . Along with the Grand Canyon , Yellowstone Park , the Redwood National Park forest , Niagara Falls , the giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park , The Great American Spectaculartook its place as a " there " everyone must get to , or die uncompleted . P59In Louisville only the Avis girls , off the track , dressed like jockeys ; in Indianapolis during " 500 " week almost everybody , including sportswriters , wore a crested cap , a crested jacket , or any other crested thing in order to look like a racing pro . Husband and wife " teams " wandered the Speedway Museum in twin nylon jackets slashed with racing stripes . One woman balanced an astronaut 's scrambled-egg longpeaked cap on top of her pink plastic curlers ; her jeweled prescription bifocals were shaped to simulate a driver 's . Her husband wore the same cap tipped forward over aviatorsunglasses gleaming with military metal . White socks gaping between his race-driver shoes and too-short nylon trousers were , however , reassuringly civilian . In Louisville the Churchill Downs red rose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usually small and delicate ( the Kentucky Derby was as frequently represented by the track 's twin spires ) ; in Indianapolisthe " 500 " crossed white and checkered flags were everywhere , in all sizes . Sponsor decals that covered almost every inch of a " 500 " car also covered the jackets of fans , collectors , and imitators ? oil crests , tire crests , gas crests , valve crests , battery crests , piston crests , ring crests , shock absorber crests , windshieldwipercrests were set in a scatter of U.S.A. and white-andcheckeredflags . That white-and-checkered-flag motif showed up on bracelets ,   earrings , cigarette cases , lighters , crucifixes , panties , brooches , cufflinks . High on the Indianapolis petty porn scale was a peek-aboobra with one cup white , the other checkered ? cut out where it counts , ostensibly to give the wearer racing room . Checkered flags , white flags as pennants , triangles , oilcloth and plastic tatters fluttered from strung wire and clothesline . Flags decoratedgas stations , auto shops , garages , supermarkets , mobile homes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car aerials . Department stores stocked checkered shirts , trousers , skirts , nightshirts , boxer shorts , swimsuits , sportscoats , which , when sold , were packed in checkered paperbags or checkered boxes and carried in checkered shoppingbags . Checkered flags substituted for the more accurate plague " X " to mark disaster stations pushing the usual Spectacular wares ? " rooms , " " eats , " " parking . " Car racing fans , a special breed , wear racing gloves as genuine ( and expensive ) as Bobby Unser 's , carry hundred-buck stopwatches , hundred-buck binoculars , multihundred-buck cameras they aim at anything in decals and crests . Stopwatches , like racing caps and jackets , express the professional status of spectators . The more expensive the stopwatch , the more profoundly knowing the fan . Before the Speedway tower with its mini second electronic timingdevice was built , the stopwatch could have been considered an essential part of " 500 " spectatoring . The stopwatch , however , means more than its function . It supposedly stands as status , emblem , token , fetish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to think he 's just one more lousy tourist or dumb sports fan . The measure of who he is resides with his stopwatch . That stopwatch has another function . It is the staple of trivia collection . A " 500 " aficionado speaks in 1/1000 second differentiations . A horse racing " in " man ticks off only one fifths . At the Kentucky Derby early morning workouts those carrying stopwatcheswill be track clockers , handicappers , turfwriters , trainers , owners , jockeys , and perhaps a very few fans . At the time trials for the Indianapolis " 500 " almost everyone carries some kind of stopwatch . It 's a standard Christmas or birthday present in Indianapolis ? kidsget them for graduation , for their Bar Mitzvah . One can guess at the status , age , or " betterment " index of a stop/watch-carrier by checking out the price of the timepiece . Some people collect stopwatches . Some keep the watches they replace so that the full run becomes a personal stopwatch museum . At the time trials the overwhelming majority of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . The stopwatch is the recognizedlocal symbol of true " 500 " participation . Fans rate their success as " participants " not by the usual gauges alone ? autographs , signed pictures , noncommercial souvenirs ? but by how deeply they penetrate the Dantesque inner reaches of GasolineAlley ( where racing cars are worked on and stored ) . One may , on special days , buy tickets or otherwise get them , so that gawking and peeking become legitimate . Points are scored wheneverone penetrates an impenetrable barrier , or passes beyond a proscribed gate ; high standing is awarded anyone whose camera focused on the dark recesses of a stripped-down engine . The different colored tags and badges which allow closer and closer accesson Race Day are soon known , quickly recognized , greatly admired , envied , yearned for , and , sometimes , " rented , " borrowed , or snatched . A commercial , industrial , or financial enterprise using the " 500 " to reward its employees ca n't simply follow its KentuckyDerby model ? transport ' em , house ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . Businesses must deliver those acknowledgedly hard-to-come-by ribbons and badges to differentiate those they are rewarding . Tire companies compete with oil companies and with other tire companies to see who can ? officially or unofficially ? open the closed-off professional car racing world to those who will talk up the " 500 " experience the rest of their lives . In Indianapolis the code slogan is not only " I was there , " but " I was almost a part of it . " Pacific-8 Conference or Big Ten alumni at the Rose Bowl may identify with alma mater 's doing-or-dying , yet recognize the obvious distinction between doer and watcher . Indianapolis sets the aficionado up in a special limbo somewhere in between . As the cop who directs traffic may develop the delusion that his wave powers cars , so the aficionado may come to believe that without his or her presence the " 500 " could never get started . There 's also a Guinness Book of Records mania that works in Indianapolis as it does in Churchill Downs : " This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly . Tradition is even more important than statistics trivia : an old gentleman told me he " started comin ' to the 500 ' when I was five ' cause my daddy was a car man . Been comin ' ever since . Sooner missed m'own weddin ' than the Race . " Nobody , in my own experience at Louisville , trotted up to Churchill Downs on a horse got up to look like a Derby entry ; in Indianapolis people play " pretend 500 . ' Their cars carry " STP " decals plastered over everything , and frequently are fitted with supplyhouse gadgets and " extras " that make every Middle American'scar his chariot . Dragsters with the ass end of their Fords flipped up power their extra-wide extra-heavy whitewalls out of hidden driveways into the gaggles of Speedway traffic rpm-ing through Indianapolis at two miles an hour . In Indianapolis a portion of the " 500 " crowd looked like sidemen to Bill Hayley 's Comets , or Sha-Na-Na ( with no put-on ) . The 1970s duck-tailed haircut was modified long , but sharp shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . Tattoos were rare in Louisville , plentiful in Indianapolis ? only100 miles away . On the interstates around Indianapolis " racers " tried out their " 500 " strategies ? riding the draft , slingshotting , tailgating on the straightaway , gunning for the inside lane , circling the field on the outside . Mufflers were consideredsissy , but even mufflerless cars scutcheoned a full set of muffler-manufacturers ' decals . On the Speedway approaches during trial days or Race Day democracy prevails : jalops , limousines , sportscars , campers , trailers , sandbuggies , antique cars , buses , cabs , cop cars , trapped ambulances , hemmed-in fire equipment , tow cars , " rescue units . " In this unprogrammed chance parade , motorized pimps and camper-housed hookers frequently draw alongside their **32;1616;TOOLONG Johns determinedly respectable next to their driver-goggle-wearing wives . Twenty-four hours before the big race , the great American spectacular time of misrule begins ? for outsiders . The " 500 " for Indianapolis residents means something totally different ? a wonderfullocal holiday , the best picnic of the year , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " 500 " means fun and a change in who or what is in town . Kids in Indianapolis take up a watch on the streets that continue US or Interstate highways through the city and see if they can spot license plates from all fifty states and all the Canadian provinces . Children cover their tricycles and bicycles with " STP " decals and careen over the sidewalks , making their own soundtrack . Toy " 500 " cars are crashed , slammed , hurled over imaginary tracks . Slot-car play gets wild . Motorcyclists on only two wheels feel only half there Race Week . Time has to be ticked off in 1/1000th seconds all week long in order to penetrate Race consciousness . In 1972 , however , Indianapolis , wrapped up in the " 500 , " could n't completely close out what was happening elsewhere . Betweenthe running of the Kentucky Derby on May 6 and the Indianapolis " 500 " on May 27 , Arthur Bremer , on May 15 , had tried to kill Alabama 's Governor George Wallace . On " 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Leningrad , Henry Kissinger in Moscow . While outsiders began the hours of misrule in which the old would pretend to be young , the middle-aged come on as swingers , the young pretend to be what their elders believed about them , the un-spectacular world went on . New York ( UPI ) ? Vice-President Spiro Agnew , in accepting an award as father of the year , yesterday defended Americaninvolvement in Vietnam , saying it was " immoral to turn a deaf ear to the weak . " The Indianapolis News , cordially unisolationist , chose for Race nay an editorial " Salute to Armenia , " not usually a high interest topic for most Midwest newspapers . It was on May 28 , 1918 , that Armenia was declared an independent , democratic republic . Its freedom was short-lived , however , and after two years it became Soviet Armenia . Memory of that moment of freedom still lingers among Armenians everywhere . The " 500 " chose as its theme " Those Wonderful Years , " encompassing , among other things , flappers , the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise and fall of Mussolini , Stalin , Hitler , the 1929 Crash , the Great Depression . In the forty-acre " Field of Action " off 30th Street , next to Gate 10 , where mesomorphs , preparing for the race , risked herniation with ice-filled coolers piled on top of hefted cases of canned beer ? and where potsmokers , gluesniffers , winedrinkers huddled under blankets ? something special happened on " 500 " eve : Terry Lee Wissinger and Karen Gwyn Hawkins . . , used their time to marry . Standing in a field of cars , circled by hand-holding friends and watched by dozens of curious strangers , Terry told Karen , " I promise to be a faithful husband through all of the worldly problems we will encounter . . . " and she in turn answered , " I want to spend my whole life as your wife . " After selections from poet Kahlil Gibran 's " Meditations " and " The Prophet , " the Rev. David Turnbull pronounced the couple man and wife . . . . In the Star on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One long-time " 500 " observer said that " the race crowd is largely good people , " except that too many even good people dumped into a forty-acre dimly lit field made for a " tremendousamount of problems " : A multitude of Speedway residents and merchants have experiencedsome unpleasant cleanup jobs annually . But portabletoilets placed in convenient locations outside the race track in the town have eased the sanitation problems considerably , police report . Something else the police did n't report : Speedway Police Department statistics do not completely reflectthe abrupt increase in crimes which occurs each May , because many different police agencies always are working within their jurisdiction and each department makes arrests and investigations as needed . . . . In April 1971 a total of 35 offenses were reported to the Speedway police : in May the total jumped to 65 crimes and then in June . . . 30 . . . . One Indianapolis reader , who still blamed Chief Justice EarlP65Warren 's " permissiveness " for just about everything , suggested a way out : The best way to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens from being victims of violence , is to get rid of those among us who commit acts of violence . The lives of a thousand criminals is not worth the life of one innocent victim . With that common sense thought , I for one call for the annihilation of the murderers among us . Another reader went even further and described precisely what was inciting crime in America : I watched the Emmy Awards on television , and enjoyed it to a point . . . . The Johnny Mann singers gave a beautiful patrioticpresentation , making a comment about the importance of working together , and pulling together . Then Johnny Carsoncame on with his remark " War Bonds on Sale in the Lobby ! " and all the stupid people applauded him ! Strange , strange humor ! The next afternoon , Governor George Wallace was shot . As sops to normalcy the " 500 " Festival Parade presented such well-displayed entertainment kewpie dolls as Phil Harris and Dick Clark . TV and film loveables were represented by Jim Nabors and Andy Devine , but the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins , star of a doomed ABC television series , his wife , Mary Ann Mobley , an actress and former Miss America . Joining the Collinses were Bob McGrath , an actor on Sesame Street , and Gail Fisher , who , the program notes said , " plays the secretary on the ABC television show Mannix . " ' Colonel Harlan Sanders , ubiquitous founder of the fried chicken franchises , turned up in Indianapolis as he would at most spectaculars . In contrast to the posh Kentucky Derby party of Mrs. C. V. Whitney was the democratic " 500 " Festival Queen 's Ball held at the new Indiana Convention-Exposition Center . The Center was suitably decorated with 7,400 square yards of black and white checkered carpet , according to a Star team of reporters who furtherdescribed the decor thus : Rising 12 feet above the tables were shimmery metal " fountains " kept in graceful motion by air currents . In the base of each flickered white votive candles , and tiny electric lights twinkled in silverleaf arches bordering the dance floor . The reporters added reassuringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a fact Eugenia Sheppard thought not worth a mention at Mrs. Whitney 's Derby party . " Several Orient-influenced gowns " and a woman with " diamond-studded eyelashes drew many comments " according to the Star . John Walsh , vice-president of the Indiana National Bank , appeared in " a display of honorary medals ? the Order of the Tower , Indiana Society Medal and the Indiana University Medal . " Even more " sparkling in the candlelit room were the lighted earrings , powered by tiny batteries , worn by Miss Pat Cronin . " Not at the Queen 's Ball , and not in the " 500 " parade because " technically it was n't a float , " was Miss Cronin 's most obviousrival , " a 12-foot-high motorized Schlitz beer can that honked at incredulous spectators from a parking lot at Pennsylvaniaand Michigan streets . " More restricted than the Queen 's Ball was the Borg-Warner Corporation party at the Indiana National Bank Auditorium on Race eve , at which " most of the 350 guests roamed the terraces where the breeze was gentle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Star 's reporters remarked how " Indianapolis society leaders wearing safe , neat business suits and their wives " came up against the " race crowd who were wearing some pretty jazzy outfits . " More exclusive yet was a party at the Columbia Club given by Mrs. Roscoe Turner for 160 guests and featuring as stars bandleader Stan Kenton and Dr. Denton Cooley , the Houston heart specialist . The Star also reported four formal weddings on Race eve . The big " Concerning Women " item announcedthat Dolly Coles , wife of the president and chief operationsofficer of General Motors Corporation , would be the very first woman ever to ride in an Indianapolis " 500 " pace car : Dolly had evidently told her good friend Tony Hulman bossman of the " 500 " , " One of these days women 's liberationwill get to the Speedway .

" You sense that a man so true to himself will never treat you falsely . In Autoweek for Race Day one Mike Knepper was reporting on " An All-Time Low in Broadcasting , " the ABC Wide World of Sports presentation of " the fatal crash of Jim Malloy " during the " 500 " time trials : Thankfully , for some time now , the periodic clamor to ban auto racing as barbaric , deadly and all the other adjectives applied to the sport by the lunatic fringe that stalks the chambers of state and federal government and wields the gavel at DAR meetings has not raised its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malloy 's accident and the special segment on Billy Vukovitch and Gary Bettenhausen , both sons of famous drivers who were killed at Indy , the clamor could start anew . . . . Sensationalizing death is a philosophy best left to the NationalObserver or the Police Gazette . It is not accepted by racing enthusiasts and it is not accepted by the general public which can see all the violent death it wishes on the evening report from Viet Nam . The News for Race Day reported in the midst of its promotional go-go that " Al Unser , winner of the last two 500-Mile Races , last night revealed the rear wings on all the cars can cause two prob-lems " : " You ca n't see over or under them so you can not see two cars in front of you , " he said . The second problem concerns " drafting . " This occurs when one car rides in the jetstream of another car , enabling the rear car to conserve fuel without sacrificing speed . " But with the rear wing the wind goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " This makes your front lighter than your rear and can cause some control problems . " Other drivers , Al 's brother Bobby among them , wondered about those wings , too . Wally Dallenbach and many other drivers were suddenly asking aloud if human reflexes could adjust to a car travelingat average speeds of 190 mph or more . Dallenbach had been a close friend of Jim Malloy , who had just been buried in Denver . " Nobody likes to talk about it , " Dallenbach said , " but how much correction time did he Malloy have at 190 ? A quarterof a second ? There 's a difference between 170 and 190 . They should have taken off the wings . It would have saved limbs and lives . . . . More guys are vulnerable to being hurt when they 're going 17 miles an hour faster than the year beforeinstead of three or four miles an hour faster . " I do n't think it 's healthy . I think everyone feels the same way . " Dave Overpeck , writing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Malloy and Malloy 's pre-crash fears . After Malloy had taken his first ride in his Thermo-King Special , he said that " a year ago I could n't even picture myself going 178 miles an hour , and today I warmed up at that speed . " Overpeck picked up the story from that point : The next day he ran 25 laps at better than 185 mph with a top circuit of just over 1.88 . We talked again that night . This time I asked , " Well , can you see yourself going 190 now ? " Jim just laughed . . . like the kid who 'd just found the secret entrance to the candy shop . . . . The sensation of speed was n't that much greater , he said . In fact , static things seemed to go by in slow motion . But there were problems , he admitted . You had to concentrate more because there was less time for relaxation on the straightaways and you had to allow for cars moving much slower than you . There were physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much greater . He said he would have to wear a tighter strap from his helmet to his shoulder to keep his head upright for 500 miles .. . . Jim was looking for speed when he went out for practice on Sunday morning , May 14 . He turned in a lap at 186 and was coming down into the third turn again . . . . Suddenly the . . . car Jim estimated could steer itself halfway down the backstretch turned . . . to the right . The skid marks up to the wall covered only 75 feet . At 175 mph you cover that distance in less than threetenthsof a second . Above Overpeck 's story AP and UPI photos of the smash-up carried the legend , " Malloy rams the third turn wall head on at 195 miles an hour . " My first day at the track I walked into a conversation about Malloy . Two men in T-shirts trimmed with checkered flags , carryingstopwatches , were twisted up in binocular straps , camera straps , gadget bag straps , with side arm lightmeters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one said . " Nab . " " How come ? " " The wife . The kids ? church . " " A man can go to church June through April . " " It was a big one , I heard . " " The worst head-on in history , they 're sayin ' . " " That 's how it goes . " " We was only fifty sixty yards from the third turn  --  " " That close ? " " We was amazed to hear he lived ? " " Four days . " " You would n't bet nobody could live through that . " " And head-on . " " Head-on , I 'm gon na tell you ? it was head-on ! Parts of that Eagle was scattered a football field away from the crash . " " Today 's Prayer " in the Indianapolis Star for Race Day went , In part : We pause in the midst of a busy holiday weekend , Dear God , to ask You to watch over us , wherever we go . Keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a holiday .   In the third Race Day " Extra , " this prayer appeared below a photograph of Wally Dallenbach being pulled out of his " FLAMING NO.40 LOLA-FORD EARLY IN MARATHON . " Dallenbach 's problem was a faulty fuel pump , as the Star 's front page story explained : " Each time the fuel hoses were disengaged from the car , the high-octane liquid would continue to flow , throwingfuel over Dallenbach and the cockpit . . . . Dallenbach sufferedonly singed eyelashes and a couple of warm hands . ' " The Star added that Andy Granatelli 's brother , Vince , crew chief for Dallenbach , " had nothing but praise for Dallenbach . Even though Wally was actually on fire twice , he kept worrying about the car . ' " Not so lucky was a Dallenbach crewman , Dennis Tussman , who " suffered second-degree burns on both arms and a leg . " Vince Granatelli I saw get so soaked with gasoline he had to throw off his clothes and service Dallenbach 's car standing in his shorts . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers are . Race promotion magazines go shrill at any mention of death , but car drivers do n't fool themselves . The odds in favor of a serious accident shorten every time one races without a mishap . Drivers talk some but think much about too-high speeds , mechanical failure , metal fatigue , metal " wear , " alloy stress . Every racing pro knows what has happened , and can happen , in the Great AmericanAuto Racing Spectacular . Drivers will tell you that the Indianapolis Speedway is not properlysurfaced for cars going close to 200 miles an hour ; nor , according to some , is it properly banked or engineered . It took the holocaust* of the 1973 " 500 , " for instance , to mandate something so simple and obvious as putting gas tanks on the left side of the cars ( so that contact with the wall on the driver 's right does n't turn a racing car into a gasoline bomb ) . After 1973 the dangerous location of pits and gas storage tanks was reviewed and altered . After 1971 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen people were injured , the photo stands were relocated and new safety measures instituted . Research and foresightdid n't make the changes ; disaster did . In its early days the " 500 " made a one-to-one connection withP71car design and motor design . Cars in the 1970s , doing 190 miles per hour , and getting about 1.8 miles per gallon , however , are n't close relatives of the family automobile . The one familiar , and in 1972 still active , car name in racing was Ford ? but only as an enginebuilder . Eagle , McLaren , Parnelli , Brabham , Antares , Brawner , among others , the important names in chassis design , are not very concerned about the family car . Yet , no matter how intricate the " 500 " engine and chassis have become , a spectator can still feel that a car is a car is a car . In Louisville , only professional racing people master the genealogicalintricacies of horse breeding , but in Indianapolis most veteran " 500 " fans know a great deal about engines , aerodynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view old racing cars historically . Material is provided to explain changes in engine and chassis design during the sixty years of the " 500 . " The horse ca n't be claimed as something exclusively American ; the automobile , from the point of view of the " 500 " fan , is . The Indianapolis Speedway Museum is an American repository of technological history and social nostalgia . The " 500 " has always been something American , unlike the Grand Prix , whose cars and drivers have been , for the most part , foreign . Sports car races are considered foreign , too , and worse ? uppity . In the 1972 " 500 " a sports car racer , Sam Posey , was driving a big " 500 " car as an outsider and interloper . The late Peter Revson , Grand Prix in character , sports car in social class , was n't acceptedas true " 500 . " Stock car drivers like southerner Cale Yarborough fit the Indianapolis image better than the Poseys and the Revsons , who , Middle America feels , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller some kind of a millionaire ? " one man said when , two days before the race , the subject of Revson 's chances came up . Revson had made the first row with a lap averageof 192.885 , second only to Bobby Unser 's 195.940 . " Do n't Revson come from Noo York ? " he added . " Al Unser must be a millionaire , too , " someone said , " winning them two 500s in a row . " " Not that kind of a millionaire , " the first man said . " Revson is born money ? society ? the East ? hell , Al ? do n't matter how many millions Al wins . Al 's still one of us . " No other spectacular is so closely identified with one level of American society as the Indianapolis " 500 , " yet Middle America does not control the big car race . Just as the Kentucky Derby higher society enclaves are sealed off from the masses , so , too , are Indianapolis 's . The " Paddock " section and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sees few racing caps and almost no racing jackets . Indianapolis society dresses in sports clothes little different from what 's worn at the Kentucky Derby several weeks earlier . Race rituals resemble Derby rituals ? " club " breakfasts , for example , which are followed by travel on buses assigned VIP traffic lanes . Club members do a lot of hard drinking in the morning , afternoon , and night of the race : Kentucky Bourbon and branch water in Indianapolis demonstrate cultural exchange . After the 1972 " 500 , " as I was climbing down from the press section near the Paddock and Terrace seats , I was passed by two men in a terrible rush . " Hurry , hurry , hurry , " one said , " or we 'll miss the fights . " He looked as respectable as Elliot Richardson , in glasses , a gray business suit , his hair slicked back . His buddy , squirming his way through the crowd , was just a little younger , and looked a lot like a puffy afternoon game-show host . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Johnny so enjoys the infield fights , " one of the wives said . " Last year 's fights got wild , and terribly funny . " " Grant always talks about the fights . Sometimes he almost forgetsthe race . Look over the side . See . People staggering . They get so drunk they have to fight . " " I do n't like fights , Wend . " " Oh , we ca n't call these encounters fights . Half a dozen drunk apes just swing away . It 's over in a minute . " Below us the crowd scattered , then massed at the tunnel entrancesunder the track as if being pulled into a huge vacuum tube . Once on the infield side , people sprinted toward their cars and buses . " Johnny would really like to be with them , " Wend said , point-P73ing a kidgloved hand at the crowd below . " In the field . He 'd love to lay out there in jeans and T-shirt all night long before the race ? it 's all he talks about from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty old man ! " " Oh , Johnny 's a lamb . He 'd get blind drunk immediately . He keeps saying he 's going to outfit his camera with ultra violet or infra red ? I never can remember which . Not the light we use in our ovens , the other one . So he can take pictures of them hugging in the dark . " Once on the ground , the Paddock people made their way back to the buses privileged to travel those designated clear lanes . Everyonequickly changed into party clothes . Post-race parties were exciting because the winners of the betting pools were declared ? as the climax to the thirty-five or forty hour party that began Race eve . For some people , though , the " 500 " was a five-day blow , or six , or seven . Those outside thought the real fun was the infield inside , but " 500 " parties , celebrations , dances , hops , gigs , funkies , formals , smoke-ins , sniff-ins , freak-outs went on all over Indianapolis . The race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important " 500 " group , sometimes joined by the media and other " 500 " public relations extensions . Sponsors , equipment manufacturers , hankers , local and national financial , industrial , and business peopleshared the action , too . In Louisville , though Kentuckians were prominent , the real " stars , " as I 've indicated , were , on the whole , outsiders . In Indianapolis , stars were rare and , for the most part , local . The " 500 " belongs to the city of Indianapolis and , by hospitable extension , to the rest of Indiana ; the Kentucky Derby exists for Kentucky and the entire nation ? and also for Louisville . The horse set establishes the Derby 's tone and has no exact parallel in the Indianapolis power structure . In place of " addresses , " finishing , prep , and Ivy schools , Indianapolis seems to value business affiliation . Society pages do n't cater to the old-hat eastern social hierarchy . Business hierarchy is what matters . Star status is conferred by position in a firm 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest . Next come national organizations with a thriving branch or division in Indianapolis or elsewhere in Indiana . In In-I dianapolis society pages , board chairmen rank above presidents , presidents outrank vice-presidents , and so on right down the corporatefoot-nichery , a system familiar , say , to readers of Fortune . Indianapolis also seems free of upwomanship in designer clothes or gourmet cookery . Few , if any , Halstons , Norells , Diors , Coco Chanels , or even Bonnie Cashins show up . At the big BorgWarnerparty , the hostess ? the president 's wife ? was refreshingly described as wearing " a long dress of crisp white pique . . . scrolledgedwith cotton plaid , " no fashion-show stopper . She said her plaid " has no meaning . I do n't even know the name of the tartan , but I like the dress . " The food at this same party was characteristically local : the guests " sampled breasts , beef tenderloin , smoked salom sic , chicken wings , roast diced duck in orange sauce and imported cheeses . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 500 " ? Ralph DePalma boeuf cordon bleu , for instance , or Pete DePaolo canard roti , Wilbur Shaw petits fours , Mardi Rose napoleon . Unlike Mrs. C. V. Whitney at the Derby , the star " 500 " hostess had n't just rushed back from Spain or anywhere else foreign . She was from Indiana ; her two sons were n't given the eastern education Fitzgerald 's St. Paul considered essential . Both attended Indiana University . Four couples married the night before the " 500 " rated bride pictures in the Race Day Star . Every college or university affiliationmentioned was local or Indiana ? I.U. , Purdue , Indiana CentralCollege , Butler University , or Indiana-Purdue ( the last three located right in Indianapolis ) . No space was assigned to describe the bride 's dress . The only information beyond name , parentage , and university/college affiliation considered important was honeymoondestination . Three of the couples chose St. Louis , the Smokies , French Lick ; the fourth declined to say . For all , the futurehome address given was Indianapolis . Down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less significant . The " 500 , " like Mardi Gras , is , as I 've alreadysuggested , a great local holiday . Those who come to the " 500 " from all over the country and the world do n't really affect the " 500 " ' s essentially local flavor . The masses who wear the checkered-flag insignia identify totally with the " home " side.  |p75In  the infield and in the forty-acre " fun field " the usual **25;1650;TOOLONG doing the usual Fort Lauderdale things , but the largest number of Fort Lauderdale jocks were from Indiana or attended Indiana universities . Sweatshirts and T-shirts parodied " Virginia is for lovers " into " Indiana is for lovers " or advertised certain Indiana institutions ? Valparaiso Tech , West Baden College , Ball State , Hanover College , Huntington College ; slightly better-knownplaces such as Earlham College , De Pauw , Butler ; nationallyrecognized Indiana University , Purdue , Notre Dame . The " 500 " provided an opportunity for one to be Fort Lauderdale without having to travel to Fort Lauderdale ( or , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kentucky Derby model : if a Hare Krishna contingent was in residence at the " 500 , " I must have missed it . Perhaps the Hare Krishna stand-up style of delivery could n't cope with low-flying ' footballs and frisbees . Loaded infield coolers were dangerous for religiously bare feet also subject to lethal beercan rings mining the grounds . Without a computer or scientific head-count , I guessed that beer and wine drinkers outnumbered potsmokers better than 100 ? 1 in Indianapolis ? and only 10 ? 1 in Louisville . Indianapolis drunks , in decibel competition with " 500 " engines , seemed to yowl much more loudly than Louisville drunks . Nonstop chugalug had its predictableconsequences : almost cheerfully , infielders threw up a lot , zonked out a lot , or clung blearily to a car hood , a tree , fence , pole , or each other . From Louisville through New Orleans , people rushed to get to a spectacular in order to drink , smoke , or seconal themselves into instant oblivion . A significant portion of the " 500 " infield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not come to Indianapolis to see a race . People attend the spectaculars to be where the action is . I do n't refer to the obvious participating pickpockets , panhandlers , proselyters , palmists , policemen , politicians , plugolas , potsellers , padres , pacifists , paramours , pariahs , parsons , prostitutes , patrons , pigeons , pedants , pushers , peekers , pentecostals , pimps , prestidigitators , prophets , punks , prudes , prattlers . Louisville , or Indianapolis , or Miami Beach , or New Orleans ? if not Pasadena ? is " where it 's happening . " The attendant circuses make the Spectacular event al/most secondary because the spectacular creates an instant communityof festive misrule . " You do n't usually get hassled at the Derby , " I was told , and heard variations on that theme for other spectaculars ( again with Pasadena an exception ) : " You can do what you want . " " Nobody pushes you around . " " It 's our party . " " In spring you need a party , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school year you need a party , " someone else said about the " 500 . " " When winter 's almost over , everybody needs a big blow-out , " was the word on Mardi Gras . Indianapolis obviously fulfills Middle America 's party " needs , " and also offers law-abiding Middle America a chance to participate in quasi-legal betting . The Kentucky Derby has parimutuel wagering , local or national bookies ? even New York 's off-track betting ? to take care of the gambling urge . Side bets resist classification , and may involve owners , trainers , even jockeys . Ad hoc pools on the winning horse 's number may be set up in various offices and organizations . More sophisticated pools may be based on the winning horse 's time . The exact order of the first two , three , four horses to finish can be used for pools . Rare , but not unheard of , is the pool based on the exact order of finish for all the horses running . In football Bowl games , betting is usually a short version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university students play all year round . Las Vegas odds-makers , in addition , establish point-spreads ? Ohio State by 3 , say , or Southern California by 6 ? but college betting is not as systematic as weekly pro football play , or the Super Bowl . Other versions of the football pool , to repeat , pay off on total points scored by both teams , regardless of who wins , or total points scored and the winning side . Which side scores first , and which scores last , is the basis of another pool , or the time of the first score , the time of the last score , the time of the first score in the second half , etc . Some go so far as to pay off on total yardsp77scored on ground , or total yards in air , or total yards rushing and passing . Compared with the Kentucky Derby and the football Bowls , betting in the Indianapolis " 500 " is homey , participatory , inventive , flexible , often spontaneous . Race car knowledge is needed for a sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool betting . In 1972 , I ran across pools ranging from a nickel to hundreds of dollars and heard that still bigger ones existed . In a World Series baseball pool or in a Bowl football pool the number of bettorsis limited because baseball games rarely see more than twenty runs scored by both sides ; in football , total points rarely go beyond seventy . " 500 " pools , on the other hand , can have an almost infinite number of participants . By requiring not only the exact order of finish for the first ten " 500 " cars but also , in complex pools , the time , down to 1/1000 of a second , the " 500 " pool inviteswide participation . Bonus points may be awarded if any of the ten cars listed finishes in the exact designated spot . For example , if the number " 34 " car driven by Sam Posey in the 1972 race were picked to finish among the top ten , a certain number of points were awarded ; but if Posey 's car was picked seventh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pools , as I 've already suggested , give added purpose to postraceparties . Unofficial results ? ignoring penalties , time adjustments , disqualifications ? are used to decide the pool winner . In 1972 , for example , the " 48 " car , driven by Jerry Grant , finished second but was disqualified for using fuel from the tanks of his out-of-the-race partner , Bobby Unser ( fuel is restricted to 250 gallonsfrom one 's own tank only ) . Pools decided right after the race used Grant 's second-place finish ; more " official " pools waited for the 8 A.M. next-day posting , which is considered final. " 500 " drivers qualify their cars in time trials over only three laps , but the race covers 200 . Obviously the fastest qualifier does n't necessarily make it over the long haul . No fuel factor exists in the time trials . In qualifying , a driver could get half-a-mile to the gallon , or less : but at that fuel-consumption rate a car would never make it to the end of the race . Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles to the gallon , or the 500 miles ca n't be completed . Motor stress , chassis stress wo n't necessarily show up after three laps , or even thirty-three , but 100 laps might bust a car wide open . Nobody preps for the " 500 " by driving the Indianapolis track 200 laps under race conditions . If he did , the prep run would probably so alter his vehicle that it would have to be considered a " different " car . No one can ever be sure if an individual car has destroyed the delicate balance between speed and endurance . A driver constantly runs risks of overheating , overstraining : essential motor parts can fail , wheels fall off , transmission , steering , brakes go bad . In an Olympics-level 100-meter race , for instance , the speed of a qualifier is recorded for the same 100 meters he 'll run in the finals . Barring injury , a runner should finish roughly in the order predicted by the qualifying times ? assuming everyone was pushed to the limit in the heats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to prepare a tote board for those finals . Horse races are not nearly so easy to handicap because too many variables must go into setting up a betting " line . " Variations in track structure , a particular day 's track conditions , race distances , allowance weights , the class of other horses in the race , the skill of the jockey and whether he is currently " hot " or not , whether a particular horse has " trained up " for a race , is bred and trained to run on turf or on dirt , as an entry or alone , is a speed horse or one who comes off the pace ? these and other factors affect thoroughbred odds-making . Even so , though horses do n't finish in the line 's predicted order as frequently as 100-meter runners do , the favorites at most horse tracks ? the " chalk " ? end up winning about thirty-five percent of thoroughbred races . In contrast , the odds against the first ten qualifiers at the Indianapolis " 500 " finishing 1 ? 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never happened . Nor is it likely to , ever . Odds against the first ten qualifying cars finishing as the top ten in any order are almost equally large . Neophytes betting in " 500 " pools for the first time are cautioned by old hands against selecting their top ten finishers out of the top ten qualifiers alone . Veterans of the " 500 " pools have a rough formula they apply : one and perhaps two first-rowp79cars can be expected to finish in the top ten ; the question is which one , or ones ? Though thirty-seven of the first fifty-five winners of the " 500 " started from pole positions 1 ? 7 ( 1972 made it thirtyeightout of fifty-six ) , the difference , in the complex pools , betweenbeing able to pick the " 500 " winner and being able to list the first ten cars correctly is vast . On the way out to the Speedway a couple days before the race I wondered how important pools were to " 500 " enthusiasm . I also wondered if the race meant anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have $5 to put out for general admission ( or an additional $10 for the cheapest Speedway seat ) . At a local hospital , student nurses coming off a shift had just drawn their drivers for the race in the simplest kind of pool : thirty-three drivers , thirty-three nurses , and winner-take-all . " I 've got Joe Leonard , " one nurse said , " is that good ? " " I had Mike Mosley last year and he near got himself killed , " said another . " I picked him again this year . So I traded him to Linda for Dallenbach . " " I 've got somebody called Sessions , " a third nurse put in . " Is that a joke ? " " Who 's got Bobby Unser ? " said a fourth . " I sure would love to have Bobby Unser . " Her friends giggled . I drove a cross-street of abandoned houses , broken windows , nailed-over doorways , peeled-paint wood structures full of sag . Wrecked cars in the back yard , collapsed mattresses leaned against an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such districts throughout America can be black or white , but are most frequentlyblack . A couple of young black men were just standing around . I asked them if they were going to the " 500 . " " Car racin ' is whitey 's shit , man , " one of them said . " Like golf , man , " said the other . " There 's one black cat hanging ' round that track . He 's sick . He la no class dude . A class dude would tell them eyeglassed mothers to suck . " " That dude ai n't in no position to tell nobody nothin ' , man . It ai n't that he ai n't big ? hell , he ai n't even small . He ai n't nothin ' . You got to be Hank Aaron or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar orp80Clyde Walt Frazier or Mercury Morris or Ali Muhammad Ali ? axe this whole town who the dude is and ai n't one person knows ? you do n't know , am I right , man ? I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man did n't , then . They were referring to Wendell Scott , a black stockcar driver , just about the only black on even that circuit . Scott had nothing to do with the " 500 " or big cars . I asked the two men if they ever bet on the " 500 . " " You mean like money , man ? " " Sick dudes doin ' that , man . Do n't need more . " " I bet , man , on somethin ' I expecially give one large shit about . " " The honky Olympics , man ? you gon na see sick brothers and sick sisters there , but this 500 , ' it 's just honky Olympics . " In Autoweek the " 500 " ' s honky normalcy was being celebrated by one of its writers , Leon Mandel : The Indianapolis 500 is a midwestern phenomenon . It is loud and hokey and basic and archaic . It appeals to the simplest emotions , it does not pretend to do anything else . The race rewards Midwestern virtues : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic elements of survival and conquer them . In this electronic age there is nothing slick and nothing sophisticated about Indianapolis . Perhaps that is why it has such enormous appeal in the heartland . " Slick " and " sophisticated " stuff happens not to be foreign to the Indianapolis " 500 " run by its boss , Tony Hulman . The " 500 " is one of the smoothest and most closed-off of all American spectaculars . Somebody slick and sophisticated is in control . The formulaTony Hulman worked out is fabulously successful . Someone in the publicity office told me it was so successful that nobody was about to take the " 500 " apart to see why " it 's doing so good . " Whether Hulman consciously worked up what is now the winning combination is less important than how that combination operates . Spectators not only identify with the drivers and their cars , they somehow have a sense that they are participating in all aspects of the " 500. "  |p81Indiana|polis  is a populist phenomenon , a spectacular which seems free of hierarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indianapolis 365 days a year : the " 500 " is a Memorial Day celebration of Middle America 's being " back home . " Slickness shows up in the obvious gap between what the Speedway promises ? almost unlicensed fun and total misrule ? and what is actuallypermitted : a two- or three-day party not that different from a college reunion or a fraternal order weekend . Slickness of another kind shows up , too , in the contrast between the stated racing ideals of the " 500 " and the actual track conditions . One of the striking features of all spectaculars is the oneness felt by permanent residents with the unique success of the local event . That form of identification , though helped by " 500 " public relationsand promotional policy , is probably the most important ingredientof a spectacular 's uniqueness . A special energy drives the " 500 " and other spectaculars forward and upward , even when the gross national product wavers or dips.  |p85Just  before dawn I drove through heavy mist to the Speedway . It had been a hot week ? humid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was bitter cold as I drove onto Georgetown Road approaching the Speedway . Stationwagon tailgate breakfasts were in progress ; everyone was warmly dressed , hunched against the wind , footstomping to keep warm . Inside the Speedway a few parties were just getting started , some still going on from the night before . The infield ? outside the campers , trucks , cars , sleeping bags ? was fairly subdued . East sky silver light outlined a frisbee sailing silent past T-shirts , boxer shorts , a jockstrap , a cribsheet . A car aerial served as mast for a yellow bra drying . Even in chilly semidarkness suntan rituals had begun . By sunriseevery torso , female , male , would shine with oil , cardboard nose-shades would be in place , lips outlined with heavy opaque creams . Some people learn from previous spectacular experience . The track itself was deserted , the stands empty ; the garage area hid the action inside the individual shops . This was almost the Speedway I saw months later , on Christmas Eve , when , on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what Indianapolis and the track were like without the " 500 . " But by sun-up everything changed . The chill was gone . Long lines formed outside the restrooms . Gasoline Alley was soon surrounded by the spectaculars fans in search of an anecdote to carry home.  | This was , after all , the day , the promise , summer 's Christmas , a communal bonus birthday . In Eastern Europe I 've seen people take off for a one-day holiday or a special soccer match similarly charged-up . Socialist countries have their circuses , too . Everyone can feel that the great day is for her or him alone . Outside the Speedway the men directing traffic in black hardhats , checkered-flag shirts , red luminescent gloves , cut the semidarkness with red-lensed flashlights . In some entering cars only the driver was awake . People from Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio , Illinois towns had started out at three or four in the morning in order to park inside the Speedway . Making it inside was part of the " 500 " ritual . Buses dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some kids told me they had n't been to bed at all ; others had slept only an hour or two . Even this early in the morning ? Middle American ideology notwithstanding ? the kid with the stash was as easily located as the Good Humor Man . Every Spectacular has its own pace , beginning , middle , and end , but none is as serendipitously orchestrated as the Indianapolis " 500 . " Begin its soundtrack with a spoon stirring a coffee cup , mix in ten more , then a hundred , a thousand , add the shrillness of ripping cupcake cellophane , Coleman stoves clanged by frypans , a ground bass of squinchy car tires , feet shuffling , broken into by creaking campchairs , the pop and hiss of morning beercans opening , escalate with thousands of transistor radios , the hand crunch of aluminum cans , and kids building teetery clattering beercontainer towers , as racecars are pushed noiselessly into the pits and festival bands start drumming up marches . Three or four tunes compete for air space ? all in different keys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , the third , all thirty-three gunning against the band music and the girls screaming in the infield as they begin to be whirled or tossed flashily from arms to arms . Footballers leap , land , catch , or miss while the inevitable human pyramid builders climb , grunt , burp , flip , fart , and curse the impermanence of things that go up only to buckle and fall . The seemingly endless speed-past of cars , loud , then loudest , fading a microsecond , roaringback , an amplified continuous firecracker show accompaniedP87by cheers , cries that rise with every crash or near crash , then fall back into mere loudness . Everything holds at fortissimo during the five last laps . Then it 's one long loud cheer , and ? suddenlysilence . Till the family stock cars start up , and bikes roar , and all campchairs snap closed . Ultimately , those thousands of feet stop shuffling ; at the end , there 's only the sound of one imaginary frisbeefloating . Every Spectacular has its unique images , too , mystic messengers invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman appears in white sheeting , a combination Baby Snooks and Aimee Semple McPherson . She pats on white-flour powder for Stakes Day , adds a Marcel Marceau arch of eyebrow , two black circles for eyes , and a bright red cupid 's bow . Walled away from the track by two thousand taller people , she nevertheless waves excitedly at the winning horse and its invisible jockey . Some use the Spectacular as if it were the New York City Easter Parade . The prancing , Isadora-scarfed , putative Mick Jaggeris at every big show , along with other trend tasters . The latestin eyestuff appears and the going head swoon . Canes and causes , new umbrellas and new lingo show themselves . And epiphanies of the unselfconscious . Those who paint their faces like Alice Cooper because those are the best faces the wearers know . A solitary black man in the Kentucky Derby crowd , his back to the parking lot fence , wears a widebrim white panama , white patent-leather boots , white linen suit , white ruffled shirt , doublebreastedwhite brocade vest , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one gold earring , and smokes a slightly warped brown cheroot . He 's the compleat stage slaveowner . In Indianapolis an enormously fat unshaved newspaper-seller in a wide black sombrero , baggy black suit , white sandals over bare feet , peddled papers in front of the Speedway . He stood on the road 's double line to service traffic going in both directions while still hustling pedestrians . Inside , the " 500 " image was the hooded crew fuel man looking like a ghostly earthbound astronaut , a deepseadiver , a mummy , science-fiction cocoon , hell 's welder , or asbestos-wrapped firefighter . Before the race , one could have deduced the race odds from where the press and people-with-passes clustered . Al Unser , be- cause of his two previous successive " 500 " wins , stood to become the first driver to win at Indianapolis three years in a row . But Al 's 183.617 qualifying speed was more than 12 mph 's behind brother Bobby Unser 's record average of 195.940 . In addition , Al 's Parnelli-Offywas not considered to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobby was starting in the top pole first row position . Al was several rows back in a position that almost never produced a " 500 " winner . Racing fans wished Al well , but few expected him to make it . Earlier in the week , the complicated " 500 " engines sat strippeddownin the garages , always surrounded by mechanic , owner , driver , sponsors , crew . In Al Unser 's garage the Indianapolis News for Saturday evening , May 29 , 1971 , dominated a wall : //Under that headline , a three-column caption gave 1971 's bad news : RACE CAR SMASHES PHOTOSTAND. 18 HURTAnd on the wall behind the crew hung a typical car-gang joke : CHUCK YOU , FARLIEDecals and stencils laid claim to a share of some winner 's glories soon to come . The commercial and/or business side of Indianapolisis serious . Winning , for a car sponsor , is everything . At stake is an advertising campaign focused on the winning car : it used x tires , y fuel , z battery . For cigarette , luggage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free TV ( and other media ) coverage is the important factor . Cameras zoom in , and linger , on the " win " car only . A cigarette sponsor , with cigarette-advertising banned from television , can " buy " TV exposure by backing the champion car . Competition affects both cars and drivers . There are always more drivers than cars , more cars than sponsors . Somebody who probably envied Joe Leonard 's Viceroy cigarette sponsorship took a picture of Joe smoking another brand of cigarette , enlarged the picture to lifesize . Viceroy dropped Leonard . Factors beyond a driver 's control could affect sponsorship : Joe Leonard 's main sponsor , Samsonite Luggage , claimed to have been badly hurt by the Arab oil embargo ( a petroleum derivative wasp89the base of luggage plastic ) . Samsonite 's volume fell . Advertising became gratuitous . Joe Leonard once more was dropped . Because of that same oil crisis , gasoline sponsors slipped away from racing ? some temporarily , others permanently . One by one , all of America 's carmakers quit the racing game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " 500 " racing balance sheet . The economics of racing are stark : it cost just under a quarter of a million dollars to back a " 500 " car in 1972 . In 1971 only two drivers ? " 500 " champion Al Unser and Joe Leonard ? earned more than that . Unlike the Kentucky Derby , in which individual competitors can appear only once , the Indianapolis " 500 " draws on the same top drivers year after year . How will Bobby Unser ? or any of the other twenty or so repeaters ? do this year ? Who is n't coming ? What changes will so-and-so make in his driving style ? What changes were made in the first row cars ? These are some of the questions raised in what is possibly the most highly competitive industry ? as well as sport ? in the country . Competition between cars may be competition between drivers , mechanics , pit crews , designers , scientists , engineers . Aeronautical theory may be applied to windflow ; physics and chemistry may modify fuel combustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linear and irreversible : Buckpasser speed or First Landing endurance is a matter of genes . No Buckpasser genes , no Buckpasser speed . Car design and car building can go forward , then move back to an earlier concept or detail . Every engineor chassis can be duplicated , modified , improved in ways the original designer perhaps did not foresee . A good mechanic like a crafty lawyer can bend the rules and produce rather unexpected results . In 1972 , cars qualified at speeds close to 200 miles an hour , teetering on what Bobby Unser called " the ragged edge . " Perhaps the limits of safety had been reached for thirty-three cars occupyinga single two-and-a-half mile track . But the Indianapolis " 500 " is successful when it runs safely , and equally successful when it does not . There may even be goons who come to the " 500 " hopingtheir spectacular will produce the biggest crash to get into the Guinness Book of Records . Indianapolis is not without its demoli- tion derby fans . Indianapolis drivers , however , win only when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when trouble will hit . Mike Mosley was leading the 1972 race on the fifty-seventh lap when he crashed into the outside wall coming out of the fourth and home turn . His car spun into the inside wall at the head of the straightaway , careened off , smashed into the outside wall again . Highly inflammable fuel forced up through the car 's bladder shot blazing out of the cap . At more than 120 miles an hour , Mosley had to stand up like a chariot driver and fight the fire while steeringhis smashed car . When he jumped , or fell , out of his burning car and began to roll on the track , the firefighting crew rushed to spray foam over the car ? unaware that Mosley was on fire under his asbestos suit . In 1971 , on the 167th lap , Mosley had crashed into that very same outside wall , breaking a leg and an arm , gettingbadly burned . Because of his experience in 1971 he had insisted his 1972 car have rail holds . In 1972 those rail holds saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " 500 " has nothing to do with accidents or car trouble . The huge checkered stocking on top of the Speedway tower is filled with party balloons released just as racetime approaches on this May New Year 's Eve . In the " 500 " parade , kids march out first , as imps , devils , woodsmen , colonials , imperialists , braided tram-conductors . Soon the morning parade inside the Speedway blends with the automotive sounds and imagessoon to take over . The first bands coming past the half-empty stands eyes-left just as the pit pneumatic guns rrrrrrupp in a test of essential race equipment . One after another , as the parade goes by , the " 500 " cars move into the pits . The build-up to the race is a highly skilled operation . Excitementis blocked out , and suddenly escalated . The instant the almost-local Purdue University band introduced its familiar Big Ten quickmarch to the gathering crowd ? " Back Home in Indiana " played at a pace for pneumatic guns ? the mood changed everywhere . Older college majorettes bouncy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " largest drum in the world " got a loud local roar of recognition . By the time the Purdue band had passed out of range , pit crewsP91had put in their protective earplugs and huddled around their revving cars . The entire area now was full of exploding starts , loud firing , backfiring , gunning as Mark Donohue , the eventual winner of this race , revved his engine . The parade continued to pass the pit area , but only the Soul Stompers of Montclair , New Jersey , could penetrate the big car roar . By 10 A.M. the Speedway had banished its parades . The track was cleared . Now , firefighting equipment , tow trucks , ambulances realistically , unceremoniously , moved into position . Nurses hung outside the Speedway Hospital , ready to go when needed . The " 500 , " once started , charges without intermission to its conclusion . Driver and car are existentially " seized . " Yellow slowdown and red stop flags modify a race , black come in flags could eliminatea specific car . Otherwise blasting noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " 500 " noise level is terrifyingly high , and relentless . For weeks after the race its characteristic roarpast remained with me . Baseball is a rather quiet sport which relaxes tensions between turns at bat . Football and basketball have their time-outs and halftimes ; boxing dictates three minutes of pounding , but a fourth minute of rest . The " 500 , " however , circles loud speeding images two and a half miles 200 times ? always the same four turns , alwaysthe same all-out gunning through the straightaways . Some spectators simply can not stand such uninterrupted assault on ear and eye . One business firm scheduled its picnic to begin at around the 150-mile mark , allowing guests to drink , eat , chat ? and avoid watching about 250 or 300 miles of race . One could actually leave the Speedway for an hour . When one returned the race would still be roaring on . In the infield during the race , amid the crush of parked cars , and the roar of the " 500 , " football and frisbee continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , wanders to some high vantage point to check out what 's happening . Many tune to the radio broadcast of the race , and never look at the cars . The infield is a bivouac area during some old-fashioned war . Nobody bothers the " soldiers " in the bivouac , and the " soldiers " are n't that concerned about those outside . At 10:50 A.M. , with the track temperature 120 ? , and hundreds of balloons sailing Seurat color dots into the Indianapolis sky , the bivouacs stirred . Jim Nabors sang " Back Home in Indiana . " The real " 500 " theme song followed ? Tony Hulman 's public-address system words : " Gentlemen , start your engines . " Up rose a tribal howl similar to the Louisville cry that greeted the first notes of " My Old Kentucky Home . " Two and a half banked miles of spectators roared as engines turned over , caught , and drivers held up a right forefinger in the " engine started " sign . Thirty-two cars moved at once with the pace car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. J. Foyt 's , alas , was left standing . Quickly his crew moved it off the track . The pace car , with Jim Rathjnann driving , came around on its first lap , the yellow flag out ; Foyt 's car still could n't get going . Thirty-two cars hung anxiouslybehind Rathmann 's pace car , waiting for the green flag to go up . A.J. could n't get his car to budge . Not till the third pace lap did he make contact , and creep slowly into line . Almost immediatelyStarter Pat Vidan gave his flashy bent-knee , whipping " go " with the green flag . The field , led by Bobby Unser , shifted up from the pace car 's final 125 mph to 160 , 180 , then higher . For ten laps Bobby Unser 's speed averaged over 176 mph ? about 8 mph faster than the 1971 ten-lap record . In what looked like an absurd runaway Bobby lapped his first car . By lap twentyonehe had lapped all but the first ten starting . By lap twenty-three Bobby lapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his motor , " cutting fuel consumption , Bobby suddenly stopped dead . He had broken a five-buck rotor on his distributor . His engine cut off . Bobby was out . The damage could have been repaired thirty or fifty laps later ? when the car had cooled down ? but Bobby preferred not . " What the heck , " he said , " I came here to race to win , not run for eighteenth place . " On lap fifty-seven I heard a terrible screaming come from the stands north of where I sat . Then I saw car " 98 " ? Mike Mosley'sonfire , and Mosley standing up , hanging on to those outside handrailsand steering to avoid hitting the wall head-on . Minutes after the crash Mosley was doused with foam , packed in ice by Speed-P93way doctors , flown by helicopter to the special burns ward in Methodist Hospital . Speedway Hospital , before the Mosley fire , had had to deal with the usual Spectacular freak-outs , bad-trippers , suicidal drunks , pilgrimswith cut and burned feet . By ten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana sun which fired parked cars , infield dust , discarded beercans . Beerringsbecame sharp , burning foot traps in the infield obstacle course . Communal trippers , like eaters of the magic Indian mushroom , had to be comforted and reassured . One camper played a " Grateful Dead " cassette for lonely acidheads pulsating among broken squares and warped circles . Dennis Tusman , of Wally Dallenbach 's crew , was badly burned by the same spraying fuel Dallenbach escaped . Tusman , too , like Mike Mosley , was flown to Methodist Hospital 's special burns ward . Just after the race began , a Speedway guard suffered a heart attack and beat Mosley and Dallenbach to Methodist , dead on arrival . On duty at the track hospital , among white-uniformed doctors and nurses , was the seventy-four-year-old Speedway chaplain , standing by in case any Roman Catholic driver needed his rites . Fortunately , in 1972 his services were not required . One ominous big-car word in 1972 was turbulence . Turbulence caught rookie Mike Hiss , spun him completely around . He hit nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , in less than a full lap , was replaced by the green . Peter Revson 's description of the race touched on turbulence as a 1970 's hazard : " With the turbulence out there with the wings , you have to be careful how you pass . It was about as bad as I figured with the turbulence ? a lot different from last year . You ca n't follow a car through the turn and expect to pass him . You have to sort of hang back on one of his wheels . " When the semi-official 1972 list of mechanical and materials failures was drawn up , " turbulence " was not included . Every big car driver is as aware of turbulence as any airplane pilot . The 1972 list of failures and mishaps included Bobby Unser 's **27;1677;TOOLONG rotor , Gary Bettenhausen 's ignition mal/function ( at a point when Gary , too , like Bobby Unser before him , seemed to have the race cinched ) . Broken connecting rods on their Michner-Patrick cars knocked out teammates Johnny Rutherford and Swede Savage ; Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Equipment failure points up the limits of will in racing . Neither will nor skill seemed relevant to the widely differing Indianapolis destinies of Johnny Rutherford , Swede Savage , and Salt Walther : Savage and Walther were victims in those blazing crashes of 1973 ? Savage dying ; Johnny Rutherford went on to win the race in 1974 . In 1972 teammates Peter Revson and Gordon Johncock were knocked out of the " 500 " by minor malfunctions : Gordon Johncock won the curtailed 1973 race ; Peter Revson was killed racing in 1974 . And 1972 's winner , Mark Donohue , was killed in Austria three years later . Of the thirty-three cars starting the 1972 " 500 , " only fifteen ? regardless of what a driver willed ? were still running at the end . After establishing a new thirty-lap average speed of 179.322 ? 16 miles higher than the 1971 record ? Bobby Unser , to repeat , was out . Gary Bettenhausen took over the lead , held it from lap thirty-one till Mike Mosley took over . Then Mosley crashed , and Bettenhausen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mosley , and took back the lead . From lap fiftyeight , it was all Gary Bettenhausen 's seemingly lucky " 76 " ; 100 laps later still it was Bettenhausen . Even then , Bettenhausen said after the race , " I knew I would n't be around for the finish . Things were going too good to be true and I just had a feeling something was going to happen . " " It 's the nineteenth year of the Bettenhausen jinx , " said one of Bettenhausen 's brothers , Merle , referring to the failure not only of Gary but of their father , Tony Bettenhausen ? killed during a " 500 " ? ever to win at Indianapolis . Those in the stands saw Gary Bettenhausen fall back , then drop out of the race ; they also heard , in every section of the Speedway , the " death " sound of a " sour motor " firing out of sequence . Overheating was the result , and its consequences , useless pistons . " My water temperature started out at 200 and it kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting out of theP95throttle real early , then stomping on it , trying to cool things down with my fuel , but it did n't work . " By lap 177 Bettenhausen started to fall back ? from second behind Jerry Grant , to third ? and by lap 188 , when his teammate , Mark Donohue , took over the lead from Jerry Grant ( in the pit to check his left front tire ) , Bettenhausen was " coming back to the field " ? rolling his tires , his engine not only " sour " but " sick . " Every successive turn around the track was at a lower speed , continuouslyannouncing Bettenhausen bad news with a **33;1706;TOOLONG farewell . The champagne set up for Gary Bettenhausen 's party had to be moved one door away , to Mark Donohue 's garage 76 . Fruit and flower baskets , telegrams and cablesof congratulations accompanied a fat winner 's check , and the Borg-Warner trophy into Mark Donohue 's garage 76 . By the time Mark Donohue got the checkered flag , Gary Bettenhausen was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which only Donohue 's car entered . Their two blue SunocoMcLarensseemed exactly alike ; their will-to-win commitment was undoubtedly intense ? and equal . Mark Donohue was the champion . Being the champion 's teammate was small consolation for Gary Bettenhausen . Donohue , fourth , third , second for most of the race , was conservativeall the way . While Bobby Unser was zooming records into the " 500 " books , and while Gary Bettenhausen led the field lap after lap , Donohue , without " the best and strongest car " in 1972 , bided his time . As for the fastest and strongest car , " We had that last year , " Donohue said later , " and it did n't work out . So this year we went for reliability . " Indianapolis had the knowledgeable fans to understand the meaning of such choices . For instance , Donohue 's conservative strategy in 1972 called for a " smaller blower turbocharger " on which he , as not only driver but engineerfor Roger Penske 's team , decided " to turn the boost way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could n't pass very well going down the straightaways . But in the end it worked out for the best . " Donohue 's " gamble " required top efficiency and speedy executionfrom his pit crew . In the battle with Jerry Grant , Donohue 's pit was able to do his servicing ? and Bettenhausen 's ? in under thirty seconds . Jerry Grant 's took forty-three . Each thirteenseconddifference translated , on the track , into one fourth of a lap . Monitoring the differences were those thousands of Indianapolis aficionados , clocking the pitwork , leaving the lap speed to the electronictimers , " I 'm just the guy who turns left and stands on it the throttle , " Donohue said after the race . " I feel like I have the last job in a long line , and the rest do n't mean much unless I do mine . " Every man in Mark Donohue 's chain of assigned responsibilities was up cheering as Pat Vidan gave his gaudy double flip-flap checkered-flag victory wave . Fists shot up in the air , fingers insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bettenhausen 's men , in Sunoco gas-pumping outfits ? yellow shirt , blue pants ? sprinted into Victory Lane behind the shouting happy pit crew . Donohue 's mother , Zilly , joined Mark in Victory Lane , Donohue wreathed in orchids , red-white-and-blue ribbons , checkered-flag bunting . Posing for victory photographs , he put on a brand-new cap with " Goodyear " printed on it clear as a billboard . The Goodyear Hermes 's winged foot on a racing shoe was as prominentover Donohue 's happy heart . " Sunoco , " the word which had dominated Donohue 's car , got only right , non-heart , billing on his racing suit . The " 500 " final edition of the Indianapolis Star carried the headline Mark Donohue could hang on his wall in 1973 : DONOHUE CAPTURES 500 ' PLUM , EXPECTED TO GET $200,000 PLUSA picture above the headline showed Donohue 's " 66 " getting the checkered flag ; the secondary caption claimed that 1972 's was the " FASTEST , SAFEST 500-MILE RACE " ever . The race was over , but not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrained by the firm wire fences separating spectator from pit , Victory Lane , Gasoline Alley , and track . The end of anything attended by over a quarter million people can be scary . Everyone connected with Speedway car and pedestrian controlknew about the 1968 Buenos Aires soccer disaster : lighted pieces of paper thrown into a crowd caused a panic which sent thousands charging against firmly locked gates . Seventy-one people were trampled to death in Buenos Aires . The Speedway ? in re-P97sponse , of course ? added a number of extra exit gates to relieve sudden pedestrian pressure . Even so , the rush to see the winner in Victory Lane was frightening . So was the sight of people sprinting to be first out of the Speedway . Cars , in some instances , were parked a mile or two away , which put the biggest press of pedestriansand cars not inside the Speedway , but out . In the infield , however , people did n't hurry . An Indiana State Police lieutenant could n't understand why " for some reason those leaving . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to leave the infield because they did n't want their Spectacular party to end . As long as one stayed inside , the Big Day hung on . Pedestrians rushed by , cars starting up blew huge dust clouds , tires squealed in simulated dragstrip macho displayright next to infielders unconcernedly spread out on their blankets or still floating frisbees . Some people sat back in their chairs , eating , drinking , smoking , listening to the radio , dozing . Tailgates were down . New picnics were beginning . The sun , after all , was still hot . Tomorrow was Sunday . Those who belonged in Indianapolis ? and had clubs , fraternities , sororities , social groups , families , or neighbors ? left quickly because their action was only beginning , and somewhere else . Once the infield people left their Spectacular their " something else " was barren highway ? asphalt , cement , and motorized anonymity . Traffic jams meant one thing arriving ; on the way out they were an added irritation on the road to flat time and post-party depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with its cops , its armbanded officials , its polluting automobiles . Well-fed burghers sped to their nearby homes . In time , even the most committedrevelers would have to face it : the party was over . Outside the stadium , cars in gaggle crowded together , all traffic jams merged . Beside held-up cars , people crammed the edges of roads and streamed through ditches like refugee victims of an unexpectedwar . VIPs sped off , free of cloggy traffic . In suburban upper middleclass , contractor-designed manses stimulatingly Tudor , colonial , or stonily Gothic , high-income local executives and professionalsin white dinnerjackets led their career-helping wives to the champagne punch long before the last Speedway tie-up disap- peared . Reluctant-to-go infielders were ultimately banished from dusty Eden ; comfortable Indianapolis doctors , lawyers , Gerber scientists , Eli Lilly officials , Borg-Warner executives gathered in comfortable bowers of new bourgeois bliss and celebrated their lovely race , their lovely day , their lovely system . Black cooks , black waiters and waitresses served white hosts and white hostesses and white guests the catered side dishes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new racing year ? fifty-some weeks leading to 1973 's time trials . At Mark Donohue 's victory celebration , drivers were already discussing the next week 's big car race at Milwaukee and planning the USAC circuitstrategies that would culminate , so everyone hoped , in a 1973 " 500 " championship . All night long politicians , sponsors , drivers , mechanics , designers , owners , pitmen , and assorted entertainment " stars " crowded Mark Donohue 's party to congratulate him and Roger Penske , and offer condolences to Gary Bettenhausen . Dan Gurney 's two great drivers , Bobby Unser and Jerry Grant , had come close , which was no consolation . Bobby and Dan would have to wait till 1975 for their Victory Lane picture and everythingelse exciting that followed . Clean-up crews soon began to pick their way around the few cars still stuck in the Speedway infield . In time even the Speedway hospital was empty ? of patients , and of staff . Scott Fitzgerald knew that every long bright Spectacular day is eventually followed by a darker Monday morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Indianapolis and rode a lap over the track with Al Bloemker , the track publicity director , Indianapolis was almost deserted . In the Speedway Museuma couple of women wore diaphanous pink gauze head " bandages " over pre-Christmas rollers . A few people fingered postcards in search of yet more checkered flags . In the museum aisles a man peered at rotogravure exhibits of " 500 " heroes . He and a grandson wore identical racing caps . The child , about six years old , had a dozen " Purolator " crests on his nylon racingstripedsnowsuit . Grandfather , for his " 500 " image , wore an " official " Viceroy racing team jacket . For fifteen bucks , Gramps became a teammate of Al Unser , Mario Andretti , and Joe Leonard . Though it was December , Grandfather carried his " 500 " P99stopwatch talisman . His grandson had a small Mickey Mouse stopwatch . Grandfather clutched a fistful of publicity photos ? mostly of Mark Donohue in his 1970 Sunoco . The Speedway , keyed to good news , ignored Vietnam , inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posh suites , closed-in party rooms , for its 1973 Spectacular . Ticket orders poured in ; many sections of the grandstand , 1973 , were already sold out . Souvenirs were arriving in the shops . The 1973 " 500 , " according to publicity man Bloemker , would naturally be bigger and better and safer than ever . The 1973 " 500 " turned out to be a racing disaster . It was totally successful as a car-racing spectacular . The year 1973 in Indianapolis was climaxed by the " 500 " that peaked time which otherwise lay flat and dull . Christmas was over Indianapolis , which meant only 150 waiting days left to the " 500 . " In the morning the lucky opening their presents would find new stopwatches they would use for the very first time at the 1973 race . P103To begin with , ethnologists and ornithologists would have observedthe irregularity of Miami Beach 's summer migration pattern : in Miami Beach prime time ( winter ) , vast numbers of people move from the American North to the American South . Slack season(spring) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North . Off-season ( summer ) , Miami Beach is almost deserted , or , at best , understaffed , running on reduced ergs , ohms , decibels , pheromones . Tolstoy 's simple explanation for war played down Napoleon and historical causation : " Millions of men , " he wrote , " repudiating their common sense and their human feelings , were bound to move from west to east . . . just as some centuries beforehordes of men had moved from east to west . " When , in the summer of 1972 , political hordes disturbed the usual Miami Beach South-North migration pattern , their irregular motion was , in the case of Democrats , planned . Not so the sudden " precipitate withdrawal " and " bug-out " of the Republican Party from its originally chosen convention site , San Diego . " Precipitate " was a word Richard M. Nixon and his advisers always tacked on to " withdrawal " ? from Vietnam ? even after seven years of undeclared war . Tolstoy did n't go for simplistic causalities , but not even Tolstoy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous Dita Beard ITT memo ( on the theme of **77;1741;TOOLONG ) and the speed with which the Republicans blew San Diego town . It was almost as if a floating crapgame had been tipped off that a raid was imminent . ITT had been expected to pay off with space in its subsidiary Sheraton 's San Diego hotel rooms , in gratitude , the memo seemed to say , for John Mitchell 's understanding of mergers and pro-ITT and anti-antitrust niceness . Miami Beach suddenly found itself the target of not one but two summer political invasions . Louisville and Indianapolis focus on Festival week , the season . The rest of a year is needed for preparation . A few days after the Kentucky Derby , the " 500 , " the Rose Bowl , Mardi Gras , committeesand crews are hard at work preparing for next year 's Spectacular . Festival week is handled by first-stringers . Only the top maitre d 's are around to hold out their palms , and veteran hotel clerks equipped to pick up the schmeer of sawbucks above the roar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fields its scrubbiest scrub team . After working the winter trade , affluent waiters , maitres , daters migrate North with their affluent clientele . Those left in the service trades want only to take it easy . Permanent residents , most of them retired , look forward to summer 's relaxed pace . If fewer eating places stay open , fewer people are around to compete for tables . The favored hangouts do n't usually shut up summers anyway . Beaches are deserted in summer , but who living in Miami wants beaches ? Big hotels usually run reduced-rate summer conventions the locals scorn as chintzy . Winter Miami Beach is on the same big-name entertainment circuit as Las Vegas : In the pumprooms , Headliners come and goDirect from VegasAnd the Johnny Carson Show . During the summer of 1972 the big name in Miami Beach entertainmentwas n't Chubby Checkers , or even Tubby Chess , but somebody named Tubby Boots . The only recognizable Las Vegas marquee names were those appearing live on a Democratic Partyp105fundraising telethon . Mario Thomas was in Miami Beach ? as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , masseurs , among other prime-time Miami Beach featured stars , absented themselves from the summer setting . The very best pickpockets and conpersons were off to minky northern jewel farms like Saratoga . Summer 's call-girls were a littleshrill and anxious . The hookers in the Democratic convention hotels , looked at in the post-Watergate perspective , were possibly plants from the Committee to Re-elect the President or perhaps just nice Republican college girls donating the summer of ' 72 to four more years of Richard Nixon . Every year , during Easter break , when Fort Lauderdale was being invaded , Miami Beach picked up a few lost or strayed collegians . Fort Lauderdale funsters were traditionally apolitical . The whole Pepsi Generation liked its news light and lively . A new and different generation invaded Miami Beach in July of 1972 to set up bivouac in hotel lobbies and Flamingo Park . A few Fort Lauderdale play-people turned up in Miami Beach , and only a few familiar ahistorical apolitical hippies . For the most part , the young people who converged on Miami Beach were political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower generation . On June 17 , 1972 , just three weeks before the Democratic Convention , the Watergate break-in made household words of James McCord , E. Howard Hunt , G. Gordon Liddy , and a group unfairlyreferred to only as " the Cubans . " Watergate-burglar , CIAhelper , Miami Dolphin fan , and real-estate-front man Bernard Barker seemed to be their leader and spokesman . Miami Beach was full of nostalgic Cuban fascisti , ex-Batista secret police , antiCastrosuicide squads , at-the-ready private armies and marching sodalities Bernard Barker could apparently summon to service at the drop of a hat full of hundred dollar bills . The possibilities of a summer confrontation between the Cuban right and the yippying left was water in the sour cream of any Miami Beacher 's blintzes . A modern police chief , like a football coach , often studies films of the " team " he 's coming up against next . Miami Beach 's chief , Rocky Pomerance , figured out from the way Richard Daley 's cops had played the yippies during the Chicago convention in 1968 that cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-nose . He did n't pack a Colt 45 , carry a cattle prod , wear a riot helmet , plastic face shield , Wyatt Earp hat . His unspoken response to FlamingoPark pot-smokers , for example , was , " That 's nice , kiddies. do n't fight . " Pomerance rejected the Nixon-Mitchell massive arrest strategy used in Washington a couple of years earlier . He had riotequippedmen ready behind high wire fences , not parading the streets to force a demonstrator 's big hero move . Flamingo Park could have its " love-in " or " smoke-in , " and Rocky Pomerance , being uninvited , would not attend . Rocky did n't play the conventionfor national prime-time television coverage . And Time was n't likely to make him ? or Bernard Barker ? 1972 's Man of the Year . For permanent Miami Beach residents , attending the political spectaculars was not automatic . Louisville or Indianapolis residentscould participate in the Derby or " 500 " without being delegated by someone else . Locals almost always had the most fun . During a political convention , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a ticket into a state caucus : the innermost political circles were far more remote than Indianapolis'sGasoline Alley garages . One had to be something official ? a delegate , an alternate , a staff member , a candidate , a media representative , a big contributor ? in order to be " in . " A senior citizen in Miami Beach was a person without party privileges . Here was this spectacular , here were the uninvited . One could , of course , talk with political convention gypsies like Allen Ginsberg in Flamingo Park , and perhaps join him in an om or his then recently discovered ah . Almost everything else , unhappily , was a matter of badges , tags , ribbons , passes , lapel buttons . One could perhaps make it into the public galleries on a boring day , but political pull was needed to participate further . The Democratic Convention seemed no more democratic than the Republican : in the innermost of inner party circles sat the " givers " ? sometimes , of course , particularly in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner party seats for the Kentucky Derby or the Indianapolis " 500 . " The tone of the political invasion could be felt on the fringes of the convention center and headquarter hotels , in Pumpernick 's Restaurant , for instance , the Miami Beach hangout that stayedP107open , though with a reduced staff , during off-season . At Pumpernick 's , locals and badge-wearers sat table-to-table ; the camaraderie began before the convention officially opened . A retired Miami Beach couple , Pumpernick regulars , could look up at any time and see a fresh badgery of " outside " delegates . " What kind of kweezeen is it here ? " a delegate might ask , and crane forward a little to study the natives at their food . In the set scene , repeated again and again , the waitress held her order pad close to the chest , pencil poised , face averted . " That there is pastrami and eggs , " she finally answered . " Is it good ? " A retired resident couple raised up their insulted heads : who were these dressed-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't " good " ? " Pisstrami ai n't seafood , is it ? " whispered another delegate . " I got shellfish allergy . " " It 's meat , smoked meat , " the waitress said . " Smoked ? that 's peppery , " said the delegate with " shellfish allergy , " " I get heartburn from pepper . " " So try something creemcheese . " " Creemcheese is lunch . This here is dinnertime . " " You make good hamburgers here ? " the food phobias spokesperson asked . " What 's a bagel ? " said the man , scanning the menu for creamcheese . " And what 's a lox ? " " A bagel , " a cosmopolitan woman delegate explained , " is bread with a hole in it . " " And a lox ? " " Edna , " said the man who feared heartburn , " could you please make me a good hamburger , well-done , with lotsa mayonnaise , mustard , pickle , ketchup . " " Hamburger sounds real good to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Edna added nothing to her order pad . She obviously had inscribed hamburgers well-done the instant the delegation entered . " Look who 's gon na choose us a President , " she said to the hostessas she hurried by . Later during the convention , 4 A.M. the July night George McGovern was nominated to lose to Richard Nixon , I dropped in on Wolfie 's Restaurant , an all-night Miami Beach homing station , full of winners and losers from small-stakes poker games , salesmenattending smallwares conventions , sleepy-eyed minor Mafiosi and their double-eyelashed gold-thread-miniskirted girls . An elderly man came in , looked around , sighed , dropped into the counter seat beside me . He leaned forward to fish a menu out of the invisible counter shelf below , carefully put on his reading glasses , held the menu close to his face as a blind for his quick inventoryof the close-at-hand . " Whatsamattah , " my waitress said and slopped a glass of water in his direction , " your sleepin ' pill do n't work again ? " " You make me always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said absently , still casing the clientele , " extra lean ? an ' no mustard . " " You seen me ever put mustard on a person 's corn'beef ? " The man checked to see if my plate harbored a little poison mustard . He shook off Mabel 's offer to relieve him of his menu , and resumed his tricky peek-a-boo casing of the customers . Kittycorner to him is someone wearing a McGovern button on a navy see-through tanktop . This person has on bright red lipstick , matching nailpolish and toepolish , lots of black eye make-up , a singleblack hoop earring , a wood crucifix on a leather thong , a dozen or so rings , a pink plastic watch , a slave clasp , three bracelets , a forearm covered with wire bangles . Mabel brings the sandwich . " See , " she says , " no mustard . " Lost in contemplation the man ca n't speak his lines in their nightly duet . He neglects the soporifics of corned beef , and , instead , studies Tanktop . If what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for someone so tragically fiatchested . If what he sees is a man , the frown confirms Nixon strategy . Nixon , George Wallace , Wilbur Mills , Henry Jackson , and Hubert Humphrey have been saying all along that George McGovern is the candidate of sexual deviates , the acne-faced , uppity women , poor northern whites , poorer southern blacks , Indians , Chicanos , Puerto Ricans .   " Whatsamattah , " says Mabel , " the corn'beef ai n't lean enough ? Suddenly the man ai n't hun'ry . " In July 1972 the political wisdom of enlisting Tanktop and other marginal politicals into the mainstream was a major McGovern question : the constitutional right of all to participate equally in the political process is supposedly guaranteed . After disclosures by John Dean , Jeb Magruder , Chuck Colson , James McCord , the Nixon tapes , Tanktop requires a post-Watergate double-take . Someone like Tanktop could have been hired by the Nixon team out of Central Casting and fitted with lipstick , bangles , and McGovern buttons in order to reinforce Middle America 's worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have been " Sedan Chair III , " " Roadrunner II , " or " Searchlight IV , " working the Democratic National Convention for the Committeeto Re-elect the President . I wonder now if the lavender sweatshirts tatted " Gay Power " on the back and " McGovern " on the front might not have been manufactured by some electrified Betsy Ross treadling in the White House basement . Could anythingat the national conventions be accepted as what it seemed ? To set the 1972 political Spectacular historically we must do a number of double-takes : first , for instance , on that Nixon " enemy " list . An " enemy " could fit into the total category reserved for George McGovern , or the possibly helpful category of party treasurer Robert Strauss ( and , ironically , Larry O'Brien , prime target of the Watergate break-in ) . Strauss , O'Brien , Senator Henry Jackson , Senator Hubert Humphrey shared the " right " or " moderate , possibly helpful " category that wittingly , or unwittingly , served Nixon 's ends well during the summer conventions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate end to the Vietnam War ; cuts in defense spending ; domestic spending programs to help the poor ; civil rights programs ( which invariably involved what Governor George Wallace called " busin ' " ; membershipby blacks in " white " hardhat unions ; equal rights for women ; clean water , clean air , an end to stripmining , offshore oil drilling , and nuclear power plants . To this left syndrome , Democratic , as well as Republican , opponents of McGovern radicals wanted to add abortion , gay rights among other goads to white middleclass and blue-collar voters .   My notes for the Democratic Convention are self-mocking , but , in the light of Watergate , almost naive . When I thought I was being Lenny Bruce , history showed me to be , at best , Gulliver , or Candide . On closed-circuit Democratic National Committee televisionI watched Strauss , Jackson , Governor Jimmy Carter ( of Georgia ) work McGovern over , and speculated , " Who wrote this Democratic stuff ? Patrick Buchanan ? Charles Colson ? Murray Chotiner ? " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hippies " in workshirts and jeans : in front of them the " neat " Nixon supporters faced forward , males in David Eisenhower shirt , tie , and jacket , females in Julie 's Barbie Doll dresses . The " neats " applauded Pat Nixon , the " hippies " yowled , and , I noted , " How come the Nixon faction does n't look behind to see who 's making the disturbance ? " I wrote a magazine article late in August 1972 , but did n't mention this incident because even after the Checkers speech , after Nixon 's 1962 California gubernatorialcampaign , and Watergate , who would suspect a man of using his wife in a phony demonstration ? My notes , in fact , are full of ignored speculation : I wonder who the Nixon plants are at McGovern , Wallace , Humphrey , and Jackson headquarters ? But I dismiss this kind of thing as piddling and paranoid . My notes about the Secret Service agents assigned to " protect " Democratic candidates speculate : why would n't a Secret Service **26;1820;TOOLONG report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American apparat , " my notes say , " makes all cops , secret agents , and soldiers brothers under the skin , and all opponents , dissenters , Vietnamese or domestic , ' enemies . ' " On July 10 , 1972 , in the Carillon Hotel , the National Women 's Political Caucus meets the candidates . My notes read : Terry Sanford former Democratic governor of North Carolinatalks to Caucus . Secret Service guy detaches himself , pretends to read newspaper , sidles over , watching the girl and boy " hippy " behind me . Now he reads a newspaper he holds in front of his face , the sly fox ( What kind of labor pool does Nixon draw on ? ) . The dangerous spies do n't realize they 're under a hotshot 's surveillance .

A claim made at the Watergate hearings was that the Nixon Republicanshad engineered the nomination of George McGovern on the Democratic ticket . This particular anti-McGovern game plan called for the new Republican majority to break the traditional Democratic Party hold on labor , Roman Catholics , Jews , the young , professional people ? at the presidential level . Polls showed those who favored re-election of the incumbent often explained , " He 's our President . " Strategy thus dictated a " Re-elect your President , " not a " Re-elect your Richard Nixon " campaign . Polls indicated no great love , trust , or enthusiasm for Nixon ; " Re-elect the President " strategy required as Democratic candidate someone the voters would like even less ? a difficult , perhaps impossible goal ; or distrust even more ? equally difficult but not impossible . To use the Democratic Convention properly , the Nixon brain trust had to make sure their " loser candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other contending Democrats had to be sidelined . Number one as a winner threat was Senator Edmund Muskie . Strangely , nobody during the Watergate hearings and trials asked if the CIA had ever been requested to draw up a psychologicalprofile of a possible contending presidential rival for Nixon , like , say , Senator Edmund Muskie . The successful wipeoutof Senator Muskie , remember , presented him to the nation as a broken man ? crying in public , obviously lacking the essential macho to stand up to the Soviet Union and too querulous to be entrustedwith the dangerous nuclear black box . Muskie began well ahead of Richard Nixon ? 47 per cent ? 39 per cent in the Harris Poll for May 1971 . By March 7 , 1972 ( the date of the New Hampshire primary ) , Muskie was no longer a nationalfactor . In between , the Committee to Re-elect had hired one " Fat Jack " Buckley , who , in turn , planted a Nixon man as Senator Muskie 's driver with an assignment to pick up stuff Chuck Colson and Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If someone had told me in 1972 that Richard Nixon 's personal lawyer , Herbert Kalmbach , had $250,000 available for a Segretti dirty tricks operation , I would have labeled the informant insane . Yet , somehow , the only man the Harris Poll showed capable of beating Richard Nixon in 1972 was wiped out silently and efficiently without one single doubter asking how . Before the Watergate revelations , I could have looked at Tanktopat Wolfie 's with passing speculation . But once accept the power of the Nixon team to orchestrate the nomination of McGovern ? even if their claim is excessive ? and a hideous doubletakesets in . People freely favoring abortion are no longer individualsin a national debate but actors in a Committee to Re-elect scenario to win Roman Catholic votes . Women who thought they had made great political progress in 1972 were used in another Nixon scenario to frighten apolitical women afraid of losing their " femininity .

To write about the political Spectaculars of 1972 I stand tiptoe like a painter on a swinging scaffold and try to draw straight lines on a shifting wind-blown canvas . The people at both political conventions were real , but in the White House scenarios the " real " had roles assigned them by an old fake master scripter . Psychological profiler Iago , remember , bragged he could " turn virtue into pitch " and " out of . . . goodness make the net to enmesh " the innocent . Senator Muskie , like trusting Othello , thought the fake was real . He undoubtedlybelieved the hired staged pro-Nixon demonstrations to be genuine and spontaneous . His own driver Muskie undoubtedly considered as " honest " as he seemed . Everyone , Muskie included , knew the history of " tricky Dick " Nixon . A political and psychologicalprofile of Richard Nixon was needed , but never drawn . For the Miami Beach Spectaculars , history was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky Derby and Indianapolis " 500 . " History was the Miami Beach Spectacular . Richard Nixon had created a political climate for an American Reichstag fire . One piece of door tape and many reels of sound tape changed historyby ultimately bringing down Richard Nixon just when total power seemed his . Jeb Stuart Magruder ? and others ? were absolutelycertain that success and power would win : " After all , we were the government . " Absolute power lulled absolutely . Richard Milhous Nixon had a great fall . But the ability of absolute power to corrupt an American President and all government agencies absolutely , remains.  |p117In  early July as I waited in New York 's La Guardia Airport for my Miami flight to be called , a girl of about eighteen slipped into the lounge-room seat beside mine . She was peddling underground papers . I did n't need a brown rice connection but bought a paper anyway . She carried a small pile in a macrame bag she also offered to sell me . The papers , the bag were produced by her commune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with askewheadedeagles and asymmetric suns ; and her crocheted pale-rose wool shawl and appliqued jeans ( sunflowers , daisies , and two " I love you 's " ) ; her leather sandals , studded leather belt , studded leather watchband , matching wristband , leather neckthong , attachedhemi-fired ceramic tortoise ; her silver Mexican wedding rings ( one on each hand ) , her birthstone ring ( pearl ) , her zodiac pin ( she was a Gemini ) ; her hooked-rug shoulderbag ( aswim with fish ) . Much like a peripatetic model who twirls past as you 're trying to spoon up soup at a hotel lunch , the girl showed me the beauties , and quoted me the prices , of all her commune 's creativity . She explained that a healthy commune girl had to work a foul pollution trap like the airport because " people who fly have all the bread . " Fortune , I think , pays out thousands annually for surveys that reach equally simple conclusions . " Most people lead bullshit lives , " the girl said , " so they buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bummer . " The terminal door swung open and a mass of straw-hatted McGovernites charged in , which sent the girl into her hustling act . Nobody was much interested in her notes from commune underground . Undeterred , she came back to her seat . " Politics , " she said , " has never been a high for me . " The McGovernites hollered to each other from various areas of the terminal . A TV crew growled over lost equipment . A public television producer was begging for Darvon . " They 're just pretend manic , " the girl explained , " part of the bullshit nostalgia trip . Get into their heads and you find fraternities , formal weddings . " A black family ? man , woman , four children ? came into the terminal . The girl did n't approach them . " My high , " she said , " is people . " She looked around . A drunk stretched out on a bench , his head shielded from the glare by a chewed-up Daily News ; a Cuban coupleasleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked terribly depressed as their producer approached hysteria . The girl gathered up her bag of papers . " Political convention , " she made a sour face . " No heads here . No together people . You 've got to be on a high your own way , no matter what , right ? " Once on the plane the McGovern people were strangely subdued , huddled in groups , studying charts , mimeographed sheets , newspaper xeroxes . That television producer tried to solicit **25;1848;TOOLONG from Marlene Sanders , of ABC , who sat besideme . Across the aisle Tony Randall , part of the Democratic Party 's fund-raising telethon , was talking nonstop with stewardessesand others . Passengers somehow lacked the pre-Spectacular excitement of those on their way to the Derby or the " 500 . " From Miami 's International Airport I eventually drove onto Collins Avenue , Miami Beach 's " Strip . " If Dante had been a twentieth-century American , Hell would not have been zoned in Circles , like his Inferno , but in Strips . Las Vegas would have made The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , en/forcers , crooners , etc . L.A. 's Sunset Strip would have made SecondStrip : on such a scale Miami Beach 's Collins Avenue would have barely made it as Hell 's Ninth Strip . Nobody could read wickedness in obvious commercially orgiastic hotel names like " Montmartre , " " Monte Carlo , " " Playboy , " or " Fountainebleau . " A " Fountainebleau " that rhymes with " mountain doo " suggests not a wicked French king but some kind of ginrummy-playing " Looie . " In Miami Beach asphalt and cement seal out nature . A few lonely , heroic , scrubby palms push up out of poolside tile ; ornamentalshrubbery flashes something a little green . Once in a while a tubby pelican heaves past the watery backside of the Strip 's hotels , looking disoriented , confused , lost . Birds do n't nest much in ecological disaster zones . The odd gull pecks at the shore , still convinced something real exists beneath the asphalt crust of this American pie . The people of Miami Beach , the regulars , tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins Avenue , elderly residentswarded off the sun with flouncy parasols and old worn commuterumbrellas as bannered busloads of Democrats rolled in from the airport and nearby states . " Soon 'll come the balloons , " an old woman named Becky said to me , " no matter who they pick , so long 's they give out balloons , I 'm happy . " Balloons and flags were n't too plentiful , but party regulars turned up with the usual whistles , horns , stetsons , straws , wedgecaps . A few elderly women wore two-piece white dresses as if this were a DAR convention . Some oldies clung to a fun formula evidently successful the year Al Smith was nominated . Democrats occupied Miami Beach like an army unaware the captured town had already been evacuated . One devilish chap in fez and goatee set off a string of tiny firecrackers to scare the silkstockinged ladies : watching , women delegates in pantsuits stared at the joker as if he were a six-year-old with his toilet-training in remission . As a former Minnesota resident I had arranged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monte Carlo Hotel , Minnesota headquarters . I had friends in the Humphrey majority , the McGovernminority , knew delegates who were for Shirley Chisholm , P120and others who considered themselves uncommitted . Indians in the Minnesota delegation invited me to the Indian Caucus and American Indian Movement meetings . Arvonne Fraser cued me in on the deliberations of the National Women 's Political Caucus . Becky , my new Miami Beach friend , did n't much like political conventions . " He 'll make better parades , " she said , nodding in the direction of President Nixon 's Key Biscayne compound . " I 'll tell you the truth , I 'm not much for politics . Him Nixon , who can like ? Them the Democrats ai n't overpacked with who 's special FDR . So if it 's him Nixon , or some nother nothing ? " She beckoned me over and whispered in my ear . " You want the truth ? Him Fischer and the Russian Spassky are more interesting . I know about chess like I know about politics , but with them Fischer-Spassky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best time to go visit a relative somewheres , " an old man , Herb , told me , " if you have . You have n't , you stay . This summer should be a little interesting , am I right ? Who 'll be President is a big thought . " Becky and Herb and their respective spouses lived in a highrise among the dozens of highrises , condominiums , and retirement hotelswest of Collins Avenue on the Biscayne Bay side of the " Strip . " Others lived south of the Strip in the older section of Miami Beach around Flamingo Park , or on the west side of BiscayneBay . One could always tell where the old lived from the prevalence of private hospitals , private nursing homes , waiting ambulances , doctors ' offices , mortuaries . These catered to the elderly ; others ripped them off . Gerontologists , geriatniks lived off the old , and program directors , stand-up comedians , pinochle-hustlers , dance-instructors , heartburn-curers , film-makers , diet-crazies , stockbrokers , priests , rabbis , ministers , sociologists , shyster lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investment-counselors , bookies , funeral home directors , cemetery-plot salesmen , writers , and makers of educational or noneducational TV documentaries . I saw my friend Becky and her husband , at the Eden RocP121coffeehouse counter , spooning up their Sanka , blowing on it coolly , oblivious of the swirling delegates , cameramen , headphoned media women , staffpeople with walkie-talkies and clipboards , poll results and advertising mock-ups . Sunday , one day before the convention formally opened , the key hotels were full . People massed in front of the Doral waiting to see " President " McGovern , lined up at the Deauville for a glimpse of Shirley Chisholm or Wilbur Mills . Muskie and Eugene McCarthy were at the Americana , Jackson at the Montmartre , and Humphrey at the Carillon . George Wallace had put a lot of distance between himself and McGovern by settlingin the Four Ambassadors Hotel on the far side of downtown Miami . Becky watched , Becky waited , and , right behind her back , the great political Spectacular began . Outside Convention Hall troops and police made one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On side streets between the Convention Center and FlamingoPark kids halfheartedly hustled a few cars into private driveways . Rooms-to-let went fast but , unlike Indianapolis and Louisville , Miami Beach unofficially encouraged people to camp out , in Flamingo Park . Tents went up at night , disappeared early in the morning . Packed campers sat out on Park area streets . Miami Beach 's summer transformation had begun . All the big-name anchormen were in Miami Beach ? something none of the other Spectaculars could accomplish . Above the conventionfloor CBS News hung its cyclopean orange eye . ABC News glared its three-letter logo in red , blue , and green . NBC News , in contrast , muted its presence , coming on in black and white . Becky in the Eden Roc did n't seem impressed . She sipped her Sanka and off-handedly prodded the counter poundcake to see if it was fresh . When she spotted me , she had only one question . " Say , maybe you know Walter Cronkite ? " I did n't . " It maybe ai n't too late to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roc , and elsewhere , one fell ? unconsciously at first ? into a recognition game . From someone 's stance , thrust of jaw , a woman 's skirt length , the fullness of a man 's sideburns , the prevalenceof hair spray , enamel flags , clip-on earrings , one guessed whom the delegate was supporting . The Wallace and Mills syndrome was hard to miss ? stem face , military posture ? though one frequently mistook a Wallace for a Mills , and vice versa . SenatorMcGovern 's delegates were rarely confused with anybody else 's . Among the McGovern volunteers were people brought into American politics by Jack Kennedy . Some had worked with Bobby and Ethel Kennedy . Before joining up with McGovern , some had been part of the Eugene McCarthy " Children 's Crusade . " The very young were here , and another group made up of the lame and the halt . Stammerers , the spastic , the paraplegic found once again , in the McGovern campaign , the Kennedy welcome . Children of the liberal upper middleclass were a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon convention took over Miami Beach , these people , and others like them , disappearedfrom the convention hotels . The " different , " the " unusual , " the " powerless " believed that this , their convention , would not only nominate George McGovern but turn America around . These were the naive . To assure doubters that hardheaded professionals rather than kids or amateurswould be running the McGovern show , McGovern 's strategistsstarted to refer to his key people as " hard " and " tough . " The amateurs McGovern 's primary opponents had once mocked were now celebrated as the new tough political tacticians . Their success in primaries was matched by their tough handling of certain state nominating conventions . Some minority delegates believed they were an advance guard of the quietest American revolution , the one that had brought participatorydemocracy to a political convention . One person , one vote was the ultimate meaning of the formula the McGovern-Fraser Commission had decreed for 1972 . But non-McGovern , and antiMcGovern , delegates believed that formula was a minorities scheme to steal the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just being at a political conventionin Miami Beach was a dream ? and he was a voting delegate . For the first time in his life , the man felt he was being courted . Politicians wanted to have lunch with him . He met with delegatesP123from other states in late-night conversations about the southwesternpolitical situation and Chicano expectations . " Senior Citizen Power , " too , felt strong in July , along with " Youth Power " and " Poverty Power . " In July , some Democrats could imagine righteous McGovern power overcoming malignant Nixon power . Majoritarian rule and exclusion would be vanquished forever . Richard Nixon 's Committee to Re-elect was n't flustered because it well knew that no President had ever been elected by the " minority . " " What 's the matter with those guys , ca n't they count ? " was the standard Nixon-team response to any idealistic McGovern pitch aimed at only a certain minority . The consequences of the McGovern-Fraser formula were excitingfor those brought in , a personal judgment against those left out . In almost every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personexcluded was part of the traditional Democratic majority , overwhelmingly male , overwhelmingly white , farmers or trade unionists or smallbusiness people or party workers who considered the nominating convention Spectacular a right and reward earned by hard work , much of it voluntary or unpaid . In Minnesota , a self-imposed tithe supported the Democratic-Farm-Labor Party . People who had joined with Hubert Humphrey and others in the 1940s to win control of the Democratic Party remained involved through a regular monthly contribution to the DFL . That donation bought a share in political democracy and convention sweepstakes . The immediate effect of the McGovern-Fraser formula in Minnesotawas that between a fifth to a third of the regulars objecting to the new distribution dropped out of the contributing roster . Nor would any of these people work for George McGovern ? were he , by defeating their own Hubert Humphrey , to get the Democratic nomination . Few , as it turned out , voted for McGovern in November . The French have a word for the feelings McGovern awoke in the party regulars ? ressentiment ( which " resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealousy , even hatred , of those with special privileges , a hatred much magnified when those privileges are considered rightfully your own . " The kids got to learn , " a Humphrey delegate said just one dayIP124before the convention opened ? loudly , within hearing of lots of young people wearing McGovern buttons . " Why not do it for them in the year you ca n't win anyway ? " This woman was standing on the wide green lawn behind the home of Joe Robbie , owner of the Miami Dolphins , a dedicated friend of Hubert Humphrey and the Democratic Party . Joe Robbie'sgarden party was a big pre-convention social event . Listed high among Robbie 's guests were Hubert and Muriel Humphrey . Everyone in the Minnesota delegation had been invited , and almosteverybody came . Robbie , to be fair , had also invited the McGoverns . This was no casual affair : men wore ties and jackets , women their best dresses . Booze was available in a scatter of bars , and a cater of hors d'oeuvres . Robbie 's Miami Dolphins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as team owner , got almost as much media exposure as Coach Don Shula , if not quite as much as the actual players ? Larry Csonka , Bob Griese , Paul Warfield . In the Edenlike setting of Joe Robbie 's garden I discovered for the first time that massive hatred of George McGovern which would be a large factor in his eventual defeat . That same woman delegate anxious to teach " the kids " a lesson ? I ' 11 call her " Mary " ? was redfaced with sun , cocktails , fear , anger , and hate . " Could n't they let Hubert be our favorite son , our choice ? on the first ballot ? We could have come to this convention unified behind Hubert . Those kids , " she said , pointing to an eighteenyear-oldIndian girl named Dulcie , " never worked for the DFL one day in their entire lives . I 've got friends who put in twenty years doing the real hard nuts and bolts slavery , and because she 's a minority and a first-time voter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real crazy if he thinks he 's going to win with her . " At the Robbie party I met otherwise compassionate people who ordinarily would have approved any extension of political representation , but who , instead , hated McGovern for forcing the effects of that extension on them and their friends . Wives used to attending conventions with their husbands , husbands who had alwayscome with their wives , turned up alone , and angry . In every case a minority delegate denied the Spectacular 's fun to a party worker . People normally not yahoos hated the McGovern kids asP125just another batch of " McCarthy kids , " the kind that did in Hubert Humphrey in 1968 . These once compassionate DFL regularssneered at the lame and the halt as nothing but proofs that McGovern was the candidate of freaks . Richard Nixon 's people , all of a sudden , were n't all that wrong : McGovern was for fags , lesbians , radicals , and did n't care about ordinary decent people . Richard Nixon was right , George Wallace was right , Henry Jacksonwas right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . McGovern has probably never realized that , to differentiate themselves from him , pacifists turned themselves into Vietnam hawks ; ecologists became staunch defenders of nuclear power plants , offshore drilling , strip-mining . People who abhorred the Pentagon suddenly opposed any McGovern cut in defense spending ? eventhe piddly nicks Humphrey himself approved . Ressentimentwas a powerful stimulus to hatred . It was n't lessened by what was happening inside Joe Robbie 's house . A bus stopped in Robbie 's driveway to unload twenty-five South Dakota " kids , " who , somehow , had traveled nonstop forty-four hours to get to this party honoring Hubert and Muriel Humphrey . The kids hurried into the house , displaying flagrantly large McGovern buttons . In Joe Robbie 's garden , Mary 's hate orbs found them out . To others they might have seemed nice ordinary , familiar small town or farm kids . Mary glared at them as if they were child monsters recently released from the " Village of the Damned " to do a gleamy-eyed confront on behalf of wicked George McGovern . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn her broad back : one fronted her swivel , the other stood guard behind . " I see you 're for Senator Humphrey , " the girl said . " You damn straight , " said Mary , and lit a cigarette . Cigarettes and alcohol , oldfashioned vices inimical to the McGovernite " lifestyle , " were believed to have exorcistic power over pot-wise preachments . " We 're for him , too , " said the McGovern boy . " He 's a good South Dakotan , just like George McGovern . " " He sure is a good South Dakotan , " Mary said menacingly , " but he ai n't at all like George McGovern. "  |p127quoise  almost the color of her eyes , the total image was cool and measured as tall courtly Reubin Askew bowed making introductions . If Mary , still clamped between the McGovernite girl and boy , thought the entrance of Eleanor McGovern would free her , she was wrong . They ignored Eleanor . Their eyes remained fixed on Mary and her possible redemption . Governor Askew stood fidgeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGovern carefully , graciously , engaged every exposed Humphrey button in some kind of talk . How a busload of South Dakota kids picked up in a dozen stops across that state was programmed to head straight for Joe Robbie 's house and arrive coincidental with Eleanor McGovern was a question Mary would have liked someone to answer . Mary fumed , Mary cursed , but the Robbie " Humphrey " party , nevertheless , became a McGovern affair . Mrs. McGovern did n't blink as Minnesota and South Dakota Instamatics clicked ; she spoke quietly and confidently for all proffered tape-recorders . Mary was about three Eleanor McGoverns-wide , and , in the hot sun , felt , perhaps , six . Mary did not approve of the Eleanor gestalt . " I been to Woonsocket S.D. , Eleanor McGovern 's hometown , " she said , " and nobody there ? I mean nobody ? dresses like that . " Even wearing a Sears catalogue Mother Hubbard , Eleanor McGovern could n't have won Mary over . Mary was in her late fifties , but her disaffection was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " beautiful people " Kennedy image the McGoverns were projecting . The romantic Kennedy thing picked up only a little sympathy in the Midwest during the 1960s . Humphrey people barely forgave Jack Kennedy for humiliatingHubert in the 1960 West Virginia and Wisconsin primaries . George McGovern was doing a familiar Kennedy number on Humphrey . From Mary 's point of view , these new South Dakota swingers were nothing but oldfashioned social climbers . In time Governor Askew and Eleanor McGovern left the Robbieparty . Eleanor had stayed just long enough for someone top129at all this year . Georgie gets the nomination , Minnesota people go fishing . " " Even when it 's Nixon who 'll be the winner ? " said the party worker . " Even if it 's Genghis Khan . " Class and style were as important in Miami Beach as they had been at other spectaculars . When Mrs. C. V. Whitney gave her Lexington pre-Derby party , its political implications were n't immediatelysignificant . Nor were the upper middleclass implications of the post- " 500 " parties . Style and " class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberations . At the exclusiveupperclass contributor parties one could ostensibly meet , and talk to , Marlo Thomas , Shirley MacLaine , Warren Beatty , Paul Newman , Dustin Hoffman , Barbra Streisand . McGovern 's " beautiful people " were part of a " post-Chappaquiddick holding pattern , " a large contributor told me , and really belonged to Teddy Kennedy : " But farewell McGovern if Teddy ever says yes . ' " Democrats had grown used to the Kennedy " beautiful people " combo , but few really approved the jet set 's circuses on unearned income . By 1972 , Democrats had even become resigned to Eugene McCarthy 's transmogrification . Social St. Paul was after all Gene 's as well as Scott Fitzgerald 's hometown , and , as I pointed out earlier , a close relative of Kennedy 's hometown , Boston . The George McGovern of the 1960s could not make it in such a social league . Flared trousers somehow did not go with a plain body from South Dakota . The 1960s George never was chummy with rich easterners full of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGovern could try to be eastern , knowing that a " populist " could n't have it both ways . By enlisting the " beautiful people , " McGovern gave up the claim that he was truly a grass roots candidate . Richard Nixon , later , would cry public populist crocodile tears over the theft of the Democratic Party from those grass roots folk who had always worked to support it ? whites , Southerners , trade unionists , farmers , small-business people . George Wallace excoriated that elite , and so did George Meany , Scoop Jackson , Hubert Humphrey . To show their independence of the arrogant elite , and its blacks , its poor , its welfare chiselers , its dope addicts , its bomb throwers , etc. , hardworking , taxpaying , flagsaluting , churchgoing , sportsloving Democrats should vote for ? not a Republican ? but a President who was every patriotic American 's Commander-in-Chief . The doubleness of McGovern 's victories must have amused the Nixon side . Take McGovern 's winning the battle to seat his preferredMississippi delegation . Mississippi divided twenty-two of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to George Wallace . This fantasy McGovern victory became , in reality , a staggering election disaster . From the Republican perspective , then , the Great American Democratic Convention was a remote-controlled puppet show . But sometimes the puppets , without manipulation , served the Nixon cause : the Welfare Rights movement , for example , with its prime time TV slogan " $6,500 Now ! " On Collins Avenue , in the Deauville Hotel , the Democratic telethon which tried to do without privileged big-money contributorsmust have looked pathetic to Richard Nixon 's men . After much labor , the stars had gathered a pledged equivalent of what Nixon associates Herbert Kalmbach or Bebe Rebozo could collect in a medium-sized shoebox on a middling afternoon . Autograph collectors did n't care about political implications . They huddled in Pumpernick 's on a coffee break , watching the Deauville , saw a star , dashed across the street to make a signature score . Delegates collected autographs , but the majority seeking scrawls were local highschool kids . For the serious young the telethon provided Robert Klein , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political as Mort Sahl . Klein , however , was familiar with the pop scene , and more city than George Carlin , less cute than David Steinberg . For middlebrows who believe culture is talk , there was Tony Randall , a chatty operalover . Straight hard political pitches were left to Jackie Cooper , who every hour would spell out what Nixon meant by " Four More Years . " Political groupies at the telethon wanted only Warren Beatty , or Shirley MacLaine , or Marlo Thomas . Hollywood , Broadway , and TV people in general were n't the usual show-and-blow guests who appear at telethons . Warren Beatty , for instance , ignored theP131show-biz interview game . Instead he urged other " celebrities " to join McGovern in his big campaign , to end the Vietnam War . By Sunday evening , when the telethon was over , " hippies " had set up in Flamingo Park . If Rocky Pomerance was n't going to be a Daley Chicago cop , radicals in Miami Beach were n't going to play at Abbie Hoffman . 1972 's radicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strategy , and action . Senior citizens would be taught not to fear hippies . Allen Ginsberg 's tuneless chanting was supposed somehow to help love , too . A **32;1875;TOOLONG to bridge the age and lifestylegap began with eating a communal watermelon " sculpture " of Richard Nixon . Both old and young celebrated secular communionin this symbolic cannibal act . The " love-in " was followed by an initiatory gap-closing " smoke-in . " Over the street , banners stretched the July Collins Avenue message , MIAMI BEACH LOVES DEMOCRATS ; in August , the signs would say MIAMI BEACH LOVES REPUBLICANS . The exact number of donkeys Miami Beach displayed in July was matched by the elephants of August . Buses carried the posters ; supermarketsshowed the slogans in all display windows . How much of that hippy population camped out in Flamingo Park was wired for the CIA or the FBI I do n't know . I ca n't swear to the number of CIA Good Humor men or FBI Southern Bell Telephone vans on the scene . Army , navy , air force , coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , GM intelligence , I take it , were all represented . How many of McGovern 's people in the Doral or in the Park were provocateur " Tommy the Travelers " we 'll never know either . Between 1968 and 1972 " the movement " had undergone a revolutionof its own . Unlike Chicago yippies , Miami Beach hippies did not advertise " free dope , free music , free women " in leaflets and underground papers . Four years had made a great change in the women 's movement . Movement women had been so revolted by the sexist attitudes of the male left that they took over Rat , one of the best radical underground newspapers , and began to attack Abbie Hoffman , Jerry Rubin , etc . Late Sunday night the hoopla mood in Miami Beach suddenly changed . The serious big-time anchormen hit town . CBS 's WalterP132Cronkite came to lay everything out straight . Eric Severeid was there to exhale seriousness , bare his lower teeth a little , and unload sentences all of a length , like railroad ties . ABC 's Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contrast to his confident partner , Harry Reasoner , the only nightly news star able to relax both sides of his mouth at once . NBC 's John Chancellor , possessed of an especially eloquent forehead , shared time with David Brinkley , whose thing was ironic fatigue . The convention did n't open formally till Monday night ? July 10 ? though action was already underway earlier that day . The NationalWomen 's Political Caucus ( with Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem seated symbolically on opposite sides of a lectern ) heard from the presidential candidates who wished to speak ? all had been invited . Bella Abzug sat at the power table wearing a red picture hat which bobbed a " yes " or " no " as speakers asked for support from political women . As the women knew , 40 per cent of the bodies , but not the convention'svoting strength , were female ? a direct result of the McGovern-Fraser guidelines . A candidate for the presidency was thus going to be judged by NWPC on her or his reaction to those guidelines . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicalrouser , pre-TV game show warm-up , which several New Englandand southern state women at the table next to mine found amusing. " 0 dear , " a young white Tennessee delegate said ? she wore a large " Shirley Chisholm for President " button ? " I do b'lieve Betty 's gon na give that li'l of Vassar speech agin . " While Terry Sanford spoke , the ABC crew under a woman , Marlene Sanders , started filming , and the next speaker , Senator Hubert Humphrey , made his appearance , completely surrounded by Secret Service agents . Humphrey had always been for women 's rights , but now political reality put him on the wrong side , against the McGovern-Fraser formula . As he entered the hall , women began to hiss . They stopped only after Betty Friedan and Liz Carpentershushed for quiet . The moment Terry Sanford stopped speaking , women wearing " Mis Chis for Pres " buttons began shouting , " We want Shirley ! " The " Chisholm " buttons were dis/played next to " McGovern " buttons by these tanned white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment that Shirley Chisholm was n't Angela Davis . Representative Chisholm entered briskly , like a no-nonsense schoolteacher . She waited for the spirited " girls " to get down off the tables and back into their seats . The Secret Service must have confused the Shirley Chisholm demonstrators with Angela Davis , too , I think . Their quick-draw specialists moved into position , the Number One gun this day , fittingly , a woman agent playing photographer . Her camera hung from the neck like an afterthought as she joined a male agent wearing 1972 's long hair and Fu Manchu moustache . Candidate Chisholm 's speech demonstrated that she was n't Angela Davis . If Betty Friedan made women think of the sixties , Shirley Chisholm brought back the fifties . When she was through , nobody climbed back up on the tables to shout , " We want Shirley ! " The women who jumped up were shouting , instead , for George McGovern . Bella Abzug stood to applaud ; Gloria Steinem 's cool blue-tinted aviator glasses topped a smile . Photographerscharged forward ; tape-recorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGovern word . McGovern looked leaner than on television ? just as Bella Abzug looked younger . He wore a blue-gray glenplaid business suit moderatelymod but little affecting his generally sad craggy face . McGovern immediately demonstrated that he was not to the role of women 's champion born . Liz Carpenter 's generous introductionsaid what most women were thinking : " We know we would n't be here if it had n't been for you . " McGovern , properly modest but politically fuckyknuckled , re-sponded : " To give proper credit , you have to go all the way back to Adam . " To which the women shouted as one : " Eve ! " The women then sat back to shout , " Right on , " to almost everythingMcGovern said . If one placed a Nixonian grid over this McGovern-women love-match , something menacing showed through : the National Women 's Political Caucus was energetic and articulate , had power proportionately greater than its numbers . Any Nixon scorekeeper would only say , again , " What 's the matter with those women , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the one thousand female " bodies " made eligible by the McGovern guidelines chose to be aligned with the National Women 's Political Caucus ; about 90 per cent wanted no part of it ? or any other militant women 's organization . Smarmy cheap-shot bar-car jokes about liberated women and lesbians were not withouttheir political effect in 1972 . Even before McGovern started to speak , it was obvious that someone in his organization had been counting . The American politicalconsensus is a kind of blanket lengthened at one end by cuttingoff at the other . Only 17 per cent of the American people favoredunilateral and/or complete withdrawal from Vietnam ; therefore , George McGovern could count on no more than that 17 per cent by taking an entirely unequivocal withdrawal stand . His eventual position ? end the fighting , slowly withdraw , yet leave a small residual force in Southeast Asia ? killed off most in the 17 per cent " total withdrawal " category without greatly attracting those in the 83 per cent majority . McGovern 's political blanket turned into a small mean , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be triggered by the standard Kissinger " bug-out " or " precipitatewithdrawal " speech . By forcing Meany to play Vietnam roulette , the Nixon team could get him into a golf game with Labor Secretary Brennan and thus cancel out his earlier peeved public slash at Richard Nixon as a liar , big business stooge , and enemy of labor . McGovern , adjusting his unequivocal Vietnam stand to where it could meet the majority positions revealed in the polls , immediatelychanged the attitudes of those unequivocally committed to him . A white , urban , University of Minnesota freshman and eighteen-year-oldfirst voter who had worked for McGovern in several primaries told me , " No way I 'm going with McGovern 's waffling from here on in , man . I pushed unilateral withdrawal on a thousandNew Hampshire doorbells . From now on I 'm for Dick Gregory . " P135In his National Women 's Political Caucus speech McGovern fell back on an aria from his spring primary repertoire only once : " Never again will we spend the precious young blood of this country trying to bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politely , applauded . Again , in recognition of the polls , McGovern adjusted his abortionstand by a simple political device ? omission . As his speech was ending , however , shouts of " What about abortion ? " sounded all over the hall . When McGovern 's strongest partisans tried to get a new louder " We want George ! " chant going , the cry of " What about abortion , George ? " rose in volume . Fists were shaken at his retreating back . His 17 per cent " Vietnam withdrawal " support base was being further eroded by his refusal to take a stand on abortion . McGovern left , speeches continued , but the hall thinned out . Marlene Sanders and her ABC crew temporarily stopped shooting till Bella Abzug rose to pep the women up again . " Women , " she said pointedly , " will not waffle " on any issue ? Vietnam , abortion , or the seating of controversial delegations . " The real candidate against Richard Nixon , " insisted Representative Abzug , again not doing George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Committee to Re-elect strategy was to hide Nixon , RepresentativeAbzug , and other Democrats , wanted to counter by cuing on Nixon and hiding George McGovern . " I hate speeches , " a South Carolina woman said to me as we left the Carillon Hotel . " In this day and age , why have them ? " From the NWPC meeting I went to a press conference called at the Monte Carlo by the Indian Caucus . The hall was almost empty . I thought of Glendower 's boast to Hotspur ? " I can call spirits from the vasty deep " ? and Hotspur 's reply , " But will they come . . . ? " One Time-Life woman was obviously insulted by the small turn-out , so left . One Associated Press woman covered the conference , a local TV station woman , and four TV crewmen from Germany . If one assumed the FBI had to have at least one agent present , not to mention Indian Affairs and the Nixon apparatgenerally , the press conference had a minus attendance reading . Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only candidate to make an appearance . While he spoke ,  | the German TV cameramen matched lightmeter readings as if playing " high-card cut . " Then they ducked under black-hoods like falcons . The Indian delegates in the empty hall were clearly down . A few older men tried on the white racist Indian stereotype by showingup drunk and muttering . Mike Gravel , the only " Establishment " white around , became sole recipient of legitimate complaintsand broad-spectrum bitching . Gravel had expected a large press turnout and had a fairly long speech prepared . The hall was abandoned for a small hotel bedroom . Even then the press conferencelooked silly . The drunks stretched out on the floor , belching and sullen as Gravel began to speak . " How you stand on Menominee Restoration ? " one man called up from his prone position . Lee Cook , an Indian leader from Minnesota , explained that Gravel had sponsored most of the Indian legislation the Caucus wanted to see pass . Senator Gravel offered himself as a bridge between native peoplesand Congress . Native peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them with full votes . They came from sixteen states , represented twenty tribes , but New Mexico , with a large Indian population , had no Indian delegates at all . Oklahoma , with an even larger population , had two Indian delegates , each with half a vote . Arizona , with its more than 150,000 Indians , had no Indian delegate ? in spite of the McGovern-Fraser formula . The host state , Florida , with its significant Seminole population , had no Indians among its eighty-one delegates ( seventyfiveof whom were pledged to George Wallace ) . Of the thirty-one voting delegates ( whose actual voting weight was around ten ) , twenty-four were for McGovern ? who did n't even send a representativeto the meeting ? one was for Shirley Chisholm , six were uncommitted . " We should start to make coalitions , " a young woman said as soon as Gravel stopped speaking . " With Cajuns , Chicanos , blacks , the poor , anybody minority . " " Those ai n't native peoples , " an older man countered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor whites are just Europeans . " P137From the sparse AIM meeting I went to George Wallace 's packed press conference at the Four Ambassador 's Hotel . Governor Wallace looked very thin , sounded subdued , but the Wallace politicalstance had neither changed nor weakened . He began by affirming his credo : " My positions are the majority positions of the country . " The conference had been called to show the governor was substantiallyrecovered , but also to make the point that the governor 's majority positions did not need a third party : " I do n't have any plans other than the pursuit of the nomination of the national Democratic Party . " Wallace did n't mention McGovern , though he obviously consideredhimself an important member of the stop-McGovern movement . " The Democratic Party , " he said , " has always been the party of the average citizen , " but " If I had n't won the primary in Florida and the one in Michigan , and had to rely on state conventions , I would n't have been able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Wallace 's health got answers which referred to Wallace 's " accident in Maryland . " " I have been discharged medically , " he said . " I 'm gon na learn to wheel this wheelchair around just as fast as I could walk . " With four hundred pledged first-ballot votes , " We 're gon na put the hay down where the goats can get it best , " Wallace said . His majority positions would attract uncommitted delegates from every state in the union , he was certain . After Wallace 's press conference , I drove to Flamingo Park just in time to hear a local rabbi offer an invocation to a newly formed senior citizens ' lobby enjoying the political spectacular . " We are practically on our backs , " the rabbi prayed , " with our faces turned heavenward . May we grow ever closer to Thee , and nearer to Thy heartbeat . " P141Late Monday afternoon , July 10 , 1972 , the political spectacular broke prepackaged patriotism over Miami Beach ? honor guards , flag squads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farm plenty , technological progress , military winning . In this 1972 , a Democratic fight song was socked out by Johnny Mann-like singers programmed to smile , wiggle a hip , salutehand-to-brow . The true spectacular had begun . The franchisedDemocratic show would n't differ from the Nixon productionscheduled to replace it in August . At 6:50 P.M. Bella Abzug , easily spotted in a red straw hat , sat in her New York delegation seat completely surrounded by " MEDIA . " Everyone ? TV , radio , magazine , newspaper ? wore a " MEDIA " tag hanging from the neck like a " BLIND " sign . Backpacks , rolling dollies , " minicams , " moon rigs , life-support systems passed a science-fiction movie-in-progress into the convention aisles . German crews were joined on the floor by Japanese , Dutch , French , Italians . The 1972 convention turned into a small literary congress . Life , at its final convention , as it turned out , chose Norman Mailer to report its last political show . Mailer wore his usual three-piece dark-blue New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Time-Life box behind the speaker 's platform , looking like a chubby , squat , curlier , sadder Daniel Ellsberg .   Mailer did n't seem weighed down by the third-person ( called Hemingway ) he had begun carrying around several years earlier . What made it easier , perhaps , was that in Miami Mailer was a small conglomerate , a wholly leased subsidiary of Time-Life . To do Miami Beach for Life , Mailer put aside his ongoing biography of Marilyn Monroe , whom he had never met but was anxious to explain . Marilyn Monroe 's ex-husband , Arthur Miller , was also covering the convention , applying his 30s ? 30s vision to these ' 70s . Betty Friedan settled in the press section of Convention Hall early , almost joined , later , by Germaine Greer , who , in a pale flowered ankle-length sheer , looked like Faye Dunaway or Vanessa Redgrave playing journalist in a serious political movie . Ms. Greer may have intended to observe , but what she saw turned her advocacy journalism into active participation . She discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political spectacular . Ms. Greer confronted the workers and told them their behavior was demeaning . They told her to fuck off . A few of the nervier women mistook Ms. Greer for outof-towncompetition trying to make it with educated Democrats by faking an English accent . In any event , the women would n't get out of the hotel pools or stop walking the sauna-approach beat . With all the press representatives settled in their seats , Lawrence O'Brien , the Democratic Party chairman , called for order ? late . In what might have been another omen , O'Brien mispronounced " Democratic . " O'Brien himself was in a way an omen , a colorless concession that 1972 was Richard Nixon 's year . The Democrats , to call attention to the party 's traditional role , chose a Roman Catholic cleric to back up O'Brien and give the opening invocation . After two familiar ploys , the party followed with one of its few new political figures , Florida 's recently elected senator , Lawton Chiles . In the 1970 off-year election Chiles had knocked off none other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carswell ( whose mediocrity , Nebraska 's Senator Roman Hruska had argued , would democratically representmediocre Americans on the Court ) . Down on the floor , delegates were already caucusing when O'Brien and then Chiles began speaking . It was a time of reunion , getting acquainted , everyone crowding the aisles around sectionp143leaders , delegation chairs empty . People popped up , ran out , then ran in again to grab an armful of fellow delegates . Excitement was everywhere and building . New York and Massachusetts seemed most active , almost always surrounded by important network TV reporters , who , headsets on , stared alternately into the floor camerasor up at the glassed-in network booths . Reporters favored FatherDrinan and Kenneth Galbraith of the Massachusetts delegation , Bella Abzug and Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , of New Ybrk . McGovern people scurried through key delegations like odd-lot couriers at the Stock Exchange . What the McGovern side wanted was indeed happening . McGovern runners got and gave the promises that hourly added to McGovern 's first-vote totals . Meanwhile , stop-McGovern workers came up with arguments Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most amazing ? and largely unreported by the " media " ? was the steady anti-McGovern line on the Democratic National Committee'sown closed circuit television channel . A Humphrey interview followed by a George Wallace or Jimmy Carter interview , an interview with Senator Russell Long of Louisiana or Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia would sound all the anti-McGovern themes . McGovern 's designated detractor , Senator Henry Jackson of Washington , would appear with or without his union supporters , George Meany and I. W. Abels ( of the United Steelworkers ) , and pick up the theme again . In September 1971 , when McGovern registered 6 per cent in presidential preference polls , Jackson and Meany had begun the " McGovern ca n't win " line . In July 1972 they were doing everything possible to prove their prophesies accurate . Jackson argued that McGovern , in spite of primary successes , was a born loser . Primary statistics " proved " that though McGovern came out of the primaries with most delegates , Wallace , or Humphrey , or any combination of anti-McGovern candidates , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiMcGoverncandidates repeated Governor Wallace 's argument that McGovern did not represent the majority positions of the Americanpeople . The McGovern guidelines sneaked into conversations : his opponents predicted that only " minority " Democrats would work or vote for McGovern in November . Labor , Democrats on closed circuit TV were told , would n't work for McGovern , nor would the middleclass opposed to school busing or in favor of a militarily strong America and a domestic policy of " law and order . " The " no win " argument sometimes included references to McGovern 's " gay " and " lesbian " following , his " radical " connection with " campus unrest . " Even as the anti-McGovern Democrats kept up their closed-circuit TV assault on McGovern , one of their number , Senator Humphrey , announced at a press conference that because of weak first-ballot support , he was withdrawing from the race . It was not a gracious stepping-aside by Hubert , " the happy warrior . " Humphrey 's people complained that McGovern , by concealinghis strength , particularly in California , had faked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concession speech . It did n't mention George McGovern at all . Humphrey began , " After consultation with my closest friends and supporters . . . I am . . . now releasing my delegates to vote as they wish . " There was , of course , no other way for Humphrey to withdraw since his violently anti-McGovern supporters would never go over to the McGovern side . On quite another level , Hubert Humphrey once more was the archetype beaten political man . Thumped by Jack Kennedy in 1960 , dressed up as a vice-presidential Texas Cowboy " Ken " doll by Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , chosen only after Bobby Kennedy 's assassination to be the Democratic candidate against the Big Loser , Richard Nixon , in 1968 ? Humphrey himself became the Bigger Loser in that contest . Only because Eugene McCarthy , Humphrey 's old enemy , pulled out of the Senate could Humphrey get back into federal politics in 1970 . Now he was being badly beaten once more , and by whom ? George McGovern . I well remembered a Jefferson-Jackson Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humphrey in the West Virginia primary . As Minnesota 's senior senator , Humphrey had to introduce his Massachusetts colleague . Looking sandbagged , but trying to put on the style , Humphrey passed into the hall , thinking Kennedy was immediately in back of him . He stood at the head table mike , turned to see Kennedy still far across the room , P145mobbed by Minnesota admirers of Kennedy charisma , Kennedy winning . For more than ten minutes while Jack Kennedy was being applauded , cheered , and gladhanded , Humphrey stood alone , smiling a fixed , grim , trapped , exposed smile . The man withdrawing in Miami Beach in 1972 was twelve years older , equally crushed , and crying . " We 've always been good Democrats , " he said , " and , hopefully , good citizens , and a good family . " The night Humphrey dropped out , his supporters continued to wear " Humphrey " hats and buttons on the convention floor . By next morning , Wednesday , July 12 , when George McGovern 's nomination seemed certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A CBS-TV crew filmed Humphrey banners coming down , and caught the loud ugly ripping of his posters off the hotel pillars . By noon Humphrey 's name had disappeared from the hotel marquee as if he were a departed pharmaceutical convention . Humphrey 's depressed supporters eventually put away their hats and buttons , but not their hatred of George McGovern . By noon Miami Beach was well into its spectacular . Streets flowed with people . Cars , buses , trucks , loudspeakers passed through lines of police , national guardsmen , army reserves being briefed for nomination night . Helicopters flew a continuous patrol over the headquarters of all candidates ? including the silent Humphrey suites in the Carillon Hotel . By Wednesday , July 12 , Miami Beach was the place to be for the country . The Great American Spectacular Derby run , Speedway , Rose Bowl was ConventionCenter . The action spilled out into the adjoining streets . There anti-Castro Cubans began fresh oinking for another Bay of Pigs . That special Spectacular rhythm took over Miami Beach , more intense than Louisville 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eve of the " 500 . " In Miami Beach crowds massed in a solid shuttle between the Convention Center and McGovern 's Doral Hotel headquarters . Big names , big money , and media power packed the upper reaches of the Doral Hotel , where , in a closed-off penthouse one got to by passing through smaller and narrower entrances , the McGovern side contemplated the coming big win .   By Wednesday , social , political , financial , cultural hierarchies showed themselves in Miami Beach , part of the Democratic process . The Doral lobby was constantly jammed with the young and the casual commuting between McGovern headquarters and FlamingoPark . New groups showed up , one calling itself " Bicycle Riders for McGovern . " The lobby looked like pre-exam reading week in an Ivy League dorm . The press quarters were papered with apolitical blue seahorses , sea anemones , starfish , barebreasted mermaids nipple-denied with stylish classical pasties . A young McGovern worker was nursing her six-week-old baby , debating the advantages of Hubert Humphrey 's withdrawal . In the next few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " We 've come a long way , baby " line . Richard Nixon and post-Nixon Republicanswho wondered why Republican Party membership was drastically down should have asked this young woman and other McGovern workers in the Doral Hotel . At least half of the ones I spoke to said their families ? on both sides ? were solidly Republican . Socially and culturally , Richard Nixon was more than the upper classes could take . One illusion prevailed in the Doral , that getting the nomination and winning the election were synonymous . This illusion led to changes in style . Since McGovern was already in , pot was obviouslylegal . One could now smoke openly , and never fear a bust . Outside the Convention Center and on Collins Avenue , correctivesto these illusions patrolled the approaches : pre-McGovern police and army people . I sat in a small grass police hut outside the auditorium while undercover men checked out rookie cops and told them what to expect . On the other side of the high ConventionCenter fence , a few stoned or drunk highschool kids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cop neglected to pull his vulnerable fingers out of retaliatory range . After the cop had cracked him smartly on the knuckles , the hurt kid , crying , yelled at the cop to take off his equipment and fight like a man . To comply , the policeman would have had to remove : his plastic face-shieldhis riot helmethis riot stick//p147his gas maskhis mace canhis revolverhis bootsSecurity around the Convention Center was as careful as at a large airport . Handbags and briefcases , cameras , camerabags had to be opened , checked over , and okayed ( with an oval two-color label " AAAAA " the first night , a different colored " BBBBB " the second night , etc . ) . Security on the convention floor was obtained largely by controlling access . Ramps were guarded , aisles patrolled , galleries scanned , passes constantly asked for , constantly inspected . Entrances and exits were rhythmically ordered . Busloadsof people filed into the visitors ' gallery , were seated for a fixed time , then smartly hustled out to make room for the next busload . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and higher-ranked program directors . For the most part , demonstrations were for demonstrators . From the convention floor , gallery demonstrations could hardly be seen . Most demonstrationswent off privately , a card-section stunt rehearsed a day before the Rose Bowl . Most speakers who came to the rostrum were similarly ignored . Cadences programmed for applause appealed to a few from the speaker 's own state . Of the several thousand people on the conventionfloor , only a hundred faces would be turned in the direction of a speaker . At most , fifty hand-clappers , whistlers , footstomperswould throw a few hurrahs the speaker 's way . In the year 1972 , the political " spellbinder " became a dodobird . Farewell the sweat-layered lovable political hack who could get the delegates up and cheering during pauses spaced through a speech like coffee breaks . Delegates seemed to pay more attention to the VIP boxes left of the rostrum . A candidate might appear , a celebrity like Colonel Sanders , or a real star like " Jimmy the Greek " Snyder ( whose Las Vegas futures quotations made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring of those VIP boxes was shamelessly trendy : if Muriel Humphrey appeared , the mikes and cameras instantly followed , till , say , Eleanor McGovern turned up . She would be swarmed around by the same reporters who had been putting in time with Mrs. Humphrey . A bubblegum-card hierarchy governed the convention : one Kennedy was worth about twenty of anybody else . Yet the most dramatic moment of the Miami Beach Spectacularwas n't provided by Senator Edward Kennedy . What happened transfixed the media , stopped delegates in the midst of their state-hopping : Governor George Wallace came out on stage . For a short hour , oldfashioned rhetoric re-entered the convention . The George McGovern one-man magic show was temporarilysuspended . In the VIP section Colonel Sanders smiled a glassy , goateed , string-tie imitation of his waxed chicken-bucket image . The media stampeded for the rostrum , delegates stood up . Colonel Sanders understandably mistook the excitement as gratitude for the free fried chicken he had distributed . But what roused the hall and the VIP section was the sudden appearance of Cornelia Wallace , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised speech was come around at last . As if , right before the convention 's collective eyes , an updated version of All the King 's Men were being filmed , two huge bodyguardsslammed a ramp against the rostrum , whirled to grab up a shrunken collapsed Governor George Wallace , chair and all . They strapped chair and governor into place firmly , checked to see he was secure , then stepped back , casing the convention floor and spectator galleries in concert with the dead-look , ear-plugged SecretService . It was exactly the eleventh hour ? 11 P.M. , just before presidential balloting was to begin . Wallace had timed his appearanceas a reminder to anti-McGovern delegates that their fight was n't over . As that ramp slammed into place , the Wallace demonstrationbegan . His followers tried grasping reluctant state banners , to charge uncommitted conservatives into a last-minute surge against George McGovern . Alabama , Texas , South Carolina , Florida , Maryland ? preprimary , anticipated Wallace states ? were joined by the Michigan primary 's victorious Wallace delegates , and Indiana 's , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota , George McGovern 's neighbor state . None of the committed delegatesresponded to Wallace 's invitation to join the " victory " P149dance , though almost all the delegates stood up to applaud Wallace 's survival . Wallace 's image on the podium contrasted with the bushybrowed , chesty posse-leader Arthur Bremer had almost killed . Here was a shrunken man scrunched down in a wheelchair , his scrawny neck exposed by a shirt collar that gaped far below his thin chin . Cornelia Wallace , cool now , hair combed , face set in a smile , contrasted , too , with the image of her moments after the shooting , hair scattered over her face , her body shielding the governorjust as , earlier , the nation had been imprinted by the image of Jacqueline Kennedy throwing herself across the body of her dying husband . Without such images , Wallace was an abstraction , a sum of his racist , rightist , and confusingly populist political positions . His survival , though , demanded , and got , a human response . Once Wallace began to speak political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated ? almost parodied ? the familiar Wallace tag-lines celebrating " folks who work , " excoriating " those " on " welfare . " A few boos broke from the floor , to be lost in louder booing from the galleries . But when Wallace sounded his " busin " ' theme , the boos and hisses were absorbed by conservative delegate applause and Rebel yipping . That McGovern partisan I had seen nursing her baby at the Doral cradled her child and shook a vigorous " no " at what Wallace was saying . Wallace attacked the " elite pseudo-intellectual snobbery which has controlled the Democratic Party for so many years , " bringing on more boos . Yet , when Wallace finished speaking , and those bodyguards sprang to release him and his strapped-in throne , McGovern delegates were among those who stood up to applaud . The wheelchair sank out of sight , the ramp disappeared , Cornelia Wallace slipped away , leaving Colonel Sanders to preside over the now-empty VIP stalls . Wallace 's dramatic show closed the convention 's last antiMcGovernstand . Nominating began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner-take-all total of 271 votes to McGovern before any other candidate 's tally-sheet was marked . Soon after , Ohio added 77 , New York its significant 263 . McGovern 's opposition had no real focus . " Scoop " Jackson was not the man to inspire a countermovement . Nor was George Wallace . For all his talk about majorities , Wallace had less than 20 per cent of the first ballots being called out from the convention floor . Wallace 's defeat inspired the " We Want Welfare " signs to wigwagvictoriously in the gallery . Posters reappeared to urge " $6,500 NOW ! " and " Welfare Now ! " Welfare Rights and Poverty Rights groups raised their clenched fists and chanted the slogans Nixon people loved to hear . The poverty group was soon joined by NationalWomen 's Political Caucus demonstrators noticeably whiter than those chanting " Welfare Now ! " Noticeably trimmer , too , and noticeably older , though youthfully blue-jeaned . Down on the floor , younger NWPC members from the South  --  known to the media as the " Magnolia Mafia " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled , tallied , checked , rechecked , asked to be passed , then passed again , making new counts that invariably moved totals closer to the 1509 votes George McGovern needed to win . Virginia , for example , came up with seven more first ballot votes than McGovern was originally pledged ; twenty-six Humphrey first-ballot Indiana votes turned up in McGovern 's column . Arizona , where McGovern once expected only six , delivered twenty-one , most of them once pledged to the all-but-forgotten Senator Muskie ; Mayor Richard Daley 's lack of enthusiasm for McGovern did n't prevent Illinois from adding 119 crucial votes to McGovern 's total . As the counting continued , every switch spoke of a political realignment . First Muskie , then Humphrey faced the ultimate either/or of liberals taking a stand against conservatives like George Wallace and Henry Jackson . Those politically born under the McGovern guidelines read each tally as a winning cash register ring . Big numbers signified big power . In Louisville and Indianapolis , and later in Pasadena after the Rose Bowl , those who backed a loser were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just being at the Spectacularwas the important thing . In Miami Beach , however , that McGovern tally , to many , sounded a Democratic Party death knell . Some delegates left rather than stick around for aP151McGovern celebration . The galleries looked down on what seemed unified Democratic joy and happiness : TV screens flashed unanimityhaving itself a wild New Year 's Eve ball . Kenneth Galbraith held his 6 ' 8 " happy totem high above the dancing Massachusettsdelegation , which was soon joined by happy New Yorkers from across the aisle . When the 1509 total was reached , Galbraith joined in a wild kicking hora to " Happy Days Are Here Again . " I saw no Wallace , Jackson , or Humphrey people in that illusorily triumphant circle . Late that night , after McGovern had won , I met members of the Minnesota delegation out walking , and terribly down . Back at the Monte Carlo , victorious McGovern delegates were feeling sorry for the Humphrey people or scorning them as had losers . Some actuallybelieved that the Democratic Party would hold together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bar stayed open late into the night ; happy and not-so-happy people splashed in the hotel pool ; a few of us waded out to swim in the calm dark ocean . From where we were we could see the Doral , all lit up , including that secluded penthouse in which McGovern folk stayed awake till morning congratulating each other . By sunrise , Democratic defectors to the Richard Nixon side becameknown . Others were rumored to be going over ? old Democraticblocs : unionists , professional men and women , Jews . Mayors like Rizzo of Philadelphia , and the wife of Milwaukee 's Democratic mayor , Henry Maier , would be campaigning for Richard Nixon . The nomination of George McGovern meant " go " for President Nixon 's men and women . All the anti-McGovern themes of the Democratic National Committee 's DEMO 5 closed circuit televisionchannel now could be unleashed . The Minnesota split , for example , went so deep that Governor Wendell Anderson and Senator Walter Mondale scheduled pep talks and unity meetings to underline the danger of the DFL not holding together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendedan Indian celebration , which was two carloads of American Indian Movement people light . Both AIM cars had started out , one day apart , for Miami Beach : both had used the same route south from the Dakotas and Wisconsin . On the way through some small town the first group came across a strip joint featuring a " real genuine Indian Princess " who shakes " free of her feathers and gets down to her buff . " With a Hollywood war whoop the AIM members slammed on the brakes , piled out of the car , tore down the offending signs . Cops arrived in time to arrest all the Indiansand throw them bail-less into jail . Less than twenty-four hours later , the second AIM contingent , ignorant over what had happened , passing through the same town , saw that same stripper sign newly and patchily repaired . Their ideologies suffered as much as the first group 's : they tore up the joint , and were of course arrested , and jailed . Because they were after all only imitators , and not innovators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group 's prestigioustwenty . July 13 ? the eve of Bastille Day ? everybody Democratic was a big winner . Women Democrats were obviously winners ? so Texas 's Sissy Farenthold would be nominated for the vice-presidency ( by Gloria Steinem and Allard Lowenstein , winners in every category but politics ) . While Gloria Steinem was nominating Sissy Farenthold , Hubert Humphrey left his VIP box to be George McGovern 's escort to the rostrum for the nominee 's ritual acceptancespeech . Bella Abzug , in a huge off-white picture hat , was busy trying to organize reluctant delegates for Sissy . The vicepresidentialfix was already in ? for Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri ( the less-than-famous " Tom Who ? " ) . Hodding Carter III , of Georgia , withdrew his name from **29;1909;TOOLONG with a speech . Nobody was listening . Hodding Carter 's " changing South " was a counter-Wallace politicalforce . Carter 's language was anti-populist and tried to establish a new " here we stand " for the South . " We are in the process of recreation , " said Carter ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stay here , " words strikingly similar to George Wallace 's , though their political meaning was quite different . If , on July 13 , 1972 , Hodding Carter III 's South was a winner , so were blacks , and Indians , the old , and the young . Yet of the delegates waiting to confirm George McGovern 's choice of a vice-P153presidential running mate , as many as 30 per cent would either not vote for George McGovern in November , or not vote at all ! When Thomas Eagleton was finally nominated , and cheered , and applauded , he made his appearance , his face covered with heavy perspiration . It was warm in the hall and around the platform , but warmer still in the VIP boxes and on the convention floor where people heavier than Senator Eagleton , and dressed more warmly , were n't perspiring at all . Senator Eagleton stood his daughter on a table , and the little girl pulled a handkerchief out of his breast pocket and began mopping his wet brow . Something about the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same thing many times before . I wondered ? in my notes ? whether Senator Eagleton were suffering from some kidney ailment , or perhaps under medication for the flu or a bad summer cold . Here was someone who looked like Jack Lemmon and talked like Jack Lemmon , frowning with the perplexity of Jack Lemmon . The second-lead in the movie boy-girl game , a marked loser , had surprisingly turned winner . Eagleton had been called at the last minute , and in the last minute chosen . Then why did the gaiety and delight of his children contrast so with his own doomed expression , and his wife 's ? At the time I put Mrs. Eagleton 's reaction down to her realistic reading of the Missouri presidential polls . Or maybe she was concerned that her children would be upset by the late hour and confused excitement . Every Spectacular is , at its heart , a huge party , a political Spectacularno less so than others . The celebration of Thomas Eagleton'ssudden political rise overwhelmed my questions about the strange Eagleton family tableau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently missed the first time around . Images are accepted for what they are programmed to show . McGovern and Eagleton with arms linked , and familysurrounded , made a winner pose . Then Senator Edward Kennedy enlarged the traditional picture ( getting the night 's loudest cheer ) . Then came Senator Humphrey , and Senator Muskie . Everyone took a turn at raising McGovern 's and Eagleton 's hands in victory . Finally Senator Henry Jackson , sweating almost as heavily as Eagleton , broke into the family picture , welcome as Simon Legree or Uriah Heep . Delegates did a dance in the aisles as general rejoicing started up in the Great Spectacular 's streets . Outside the Convention Centerand the Doral Hotel kids turned on , once again , for George . Blacks and whites unselfconsciously hugged each other . Hippies and senior citizens saluted the new McGovern day . TV cameras swept the hall to zoom in on confident smiles , V for victory signs , the semaphores of momentum . Thomas Eagleton , an unknown at midnight , by 5 A.M. was the best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suddenly the right kind of liberal ? i.e. , a conservative . Just as suddenlynot too old ? i.e. , early middle-aged . Not power hungry ? i.e. , powerless . Not too southern , not too midwestern , not too northern , Eagleton was unhappily not too unknown . The rest of the Spectacular is a slow dance in reversed reels , a shocker filmed by Fellini or by Bufluel . Smiles freeze , are soon replaced with blank staring . The news is out about Thomas Eagleton'spast depressions , his " breakdowns , " his shock treatment . Early explanations try to pass everything off as only alcoholic . Faces stay fixed in shock as George McGovern lets days pass withoutdeciding whether to dump Eagleton or to let him hang on . His words , " I 'm one thousand per cent behind Thomas Eagleton , " perplex everyone . In the severely edited scenario , the same people McGovern had thumped in primaries or outmaneuvered on the convention floor return , now as members of the Democratic National Committee . Larry O'Brien , a bad-mouther on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second vice-presidential go-round . The McGovern team once built up as brilliant and inventive is changed into a klotzy crew not careful enough with the obviously incriminating Eagleton data . The McGovern team is now called " amateur , " " indecisive , " " poorly organized , " and " poorly led . " Inside the Democratic Party , and outside , at Nixon headquarters , the bumbling rap was laid on George McGovern . In the new scenario the Democratic National Committee , not being subject to the McGovern-Fraser guidelines , was pre-formula ? whiter , older , male-er . Few were gung ho over McGovern . AndP155Donald Segretti 's complete success was underlined by the Eagleton disaster . Had Senator Muskie been left even wobbly he would have been an automatic instant compromise , and McGovern would have avoided the floppy swim in the national goldfish bowl which ended with him displayed for everyone to see belly-up . Democratic fission contrasted with programmed Republican togetherness . The GOP August Spectacular , packaged by The Dating Game TV team , was obviously dedicated to Senator Roman Hruska 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Nixon introduction presented the country as strong , busy , and happy as a Coca-Cola commercial . Everybody Republican dressed neat , pressed , and clean as in those urban TV fun shows beamed at detergent freaks and aspirin junkies . Dick and Pat and the Girls starred in a Miss Teenage America package-dream of romps through Disneyland in Barbie and Ken cruise clothes . Flashes of mushrooming nuclear explosions in the midst of Miami Beach vacation and sunniness reminded conservative hawks that Richard Nixon meant business bombing Hanoi and mining Haiphong Harbor . Several days before the Republican convention opened ? on July 27 , 1972 ? Richard Nixon announced , " We are not using the great power that could finish off North Vietnam in an afternoon , " and added , " and we will not " in a tone Americans two years later connected with his tape transcript message that buying the silence of Watergate burglars " would be wrong . " By that time in July , George McGovern had been changed from a seemingly easy mark to an absolutely certain knock-over ? a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the disposed post-New Hampshire Edmund Muskie . In August when the anchormen and the commentators came back to town and the political Spectacular started again , the tone had changed . The media referred to the Nixon renomination as a coronation , a spectacular Queen for a Day with ominous commentaryby an old March of Time voice . The delegates were actually a Monty Hall studio audience fitted out with little flags and funny hats they waved like space engineers whose payload has just landed safely in the clear blue Oh Golly . People on the convention floor were taught to chant Nixon Now instead of the Democratic Peace Now ? just in case anybody still did n't understand the Vietnamalternatives . The GOP rostrum was transformed into a loomingslatted ark featuring all fifty state seals . Without the GOP elephantsand " Nixon " signs , Miami Beach could have been hosting a massed convention of Elks , Lions , Rotarians , Legionnaires , which , given the make-up of the GOP , it was . Interviews with Republicans and rostrum speeches mentioned " game plans , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " the name of the game , " " it 's in the ballpark . " Shakespeare , I concluded after listening to Ron Ziegler , Bob Haldeman , John Erlichman , and Herb Klein , was quite wrong ? all the world was n't a stage but a ball park , and we but poor concessionaires trying to hustle a hard bottom-line buck by peddling perishable peanuts in its stands . The two conventions came off as allegorical contrasts . A tatteredFlamingo Park-Resurrection City crew broke in on George McGovern 's Doral headquarters during July to accuse him of using the poor , using the aged , using the young . McGovern came down in his shirtsleeves to confront the noisy , disorganized demonstration , and , in doing so , of course demonstrated what the Nixon side could call his " weakness , " his " gutlessness , " his " permissiveness . " In Republican August when nobody went tieless , wore jeans , or tried to pass barefoot through Convention Hall security , Allen Ginsberg , who made his peace moan all through the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on $150 bail . Not even Rocky Pomerance could prevail when John Mitchell 's massive arrest and massive detainment police peer pressure was applied to Miami Beach : the night President Richard Nixon gave his acceptance speech , 805 demonstrators were arrested . On television , however , the show went off unruffled . Jeb Stuart Magruder indicated why : Under Dwight Chapin 's direction , a minute-by-minute scenariowas prepared , and it was followed . Speeches were written in advance , approved , and timed so they would not run over . The less interesting parliamentary aspects of the convention were held during the day , so the prime-time hours could be used for dramatic events ? the films of the President'sP157trip to Russia and China , demonstrations by several thousand enthusiastic young people , and finally the President 's acceptancespeech . An estimated sixty million Americans watched some part of our convention , and while they may have occasionallybeen bored . . . they could not help but contrast the efficiency and unity of our convention with the confusion and conflict of the Democratic Convention a month earlier . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Welfare groups , no Poverty groups , nobody holding up signs of " $6,500 NOW ! " During the Republican Miami Beach Spectacular all demonstrations had to be outside Convention Hall . On the night of President Nixon 's acceptance speech tear gas fired at a build-up of demonstrators was blown by the wind into the Convention Center 's airconditioning , sucked into the hall , choking delegates and guests . The tear gas even reached the houses and yards of Nixon 's Cuban partisans in the Convention Center area ; some tear gas wafted into the pot smoke senior citizen converts still inhaled as their extended summer political spectacular drew to its end . Dwight Chapin 's scenario was in fact a programmed play for non-persons . They would take poll-chosen positions in tones and expressions indicated as preferential in sweepingly thorough voter research . The Number Two man in America , Bob Haldemanex-adagency star ? oversaw the Chapin script and other important convention details . Public relations men worked every touch in the Nixon show . Haldeman as the inventor of " uncola " knew how to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The America worker could be placed in Nixon 's pocket with proper pitches about Vietnam , the flag , and " busin ' . " Once neutralized in the class struggle , workers obviously did n't resent the golden yacht flotilla in Biscayne Bay , each worth a hundred thou and up , each owned by big-business Nixon contributorswearing what Charlotte Curtis of the Times described as " dinner jackets and a little diamonds . " Throughout July and August other Spectaculars images took on a literal meaning ? the color guards , the honor guards , the pledges of allegiance , the patriotic windblown , spotlighted flags . In August nothing was merely symbolic . Every uniform could be ordered into action by the Commander-in-Chief , Richard Nixon ; nobody could be mobilized by his powerless opponent , George McGovern . The IRS , the FBI , CIA , FAA , CAB , FDA , SEC , etc. , were similarly at Nixon 's disposal ? just how completely we are still finding out . If people who dealt with the government still did not understand the meaning of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Stans the Committee to Re-elect put on a highly organized political United Fund appeal . " Giving " was based not on the donor 's rough estimate of what his firm or its officers should come up with . Hard numbers , IRS figures , existed for the Finance Committeeto use . Ask not what we can do for you in the future , was the clear Stans message , unless you have shown proper understandingof what was done for you in the past . The Nixon administrationknew precisely how much a certain industry , firm , or individualhad gained through preferred legislation or the nonenforcementof laws on the books . Thus the " golden flotilla , " secure in its relationship with absolute power , did n't hide its affluence but flaunted it . To do less might have been interpreted as a show of nonconfidence , or ingratitude . Miami Beach 's Spectacular unfolded allegorically , first with the powerless displaying the aspirations of traditional have-nots . In August the powerful displayed the fruits of political pay-off . Throughout the summer Miami Beach 's residents watched it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third force , more useful to the powerful Nixon than to the powerless Democrats . In August Julie and David Eisenhower projected the neat Nixon images of youth power with Pam Powell , daughter of waned film stars June Allyson and Dick Powell . Pam , like Julie and Tricia , was Hollywood 's own Miss Voting Teenage America provided with an oversize Hollywood gavel to call the convention to order . Jaw-tense grinner Glenn Ford showed up with a flag in his lapel . Flag-pin local Cubans gave a Spanish-language pledge of allegiance to a somewhat larger American flag . The official RepublicanParty film mixed together images of " Ike " with images of John L. Lewis , Vince Lombardi , John Steinbeck , Cardinal Spellman , Cardinal Cushing , Louis Armstrong , Marianne Moore , and J. Ed-P159gar Hoover in an obvious pitch to " un-McGovern " Democrats . A " tribute to Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson " was included ; Ronald Reagan came on to complain about the McGovern , leftist , and radical treatment of a " good Democrat , " Hubert Humphrey . Mrs. Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Democrat Sissy Farenthold , she added ? made her pitch to Democrats by praising " this man , " Richard Nixon , as " warm and thoughtful , " and a " peace president . " Mrs. Armstrong'stestimonial was sworn to by Shirley Temple Black beforeJames Stewart came on to praise the " gracious " Pat . During the election , Mrs. Nixon was always referred to as " the gracious . " When Mrs. Nixon popped up like a surprise guest star on a Doris Day Show , Stewart referred to " her ready warmth that extendsacross the nation . " Pat Nixon , he said , was " elegant but never aloof , " a tag line good enough to be in a perfume commercial . On August 22 a second film salute to Nixon had John Erlichmansaying , " Education is the name of the game . " This put education in a " name of the game " league with " winning , " " production , " " profits , " " higher GNP , " " politics , " " business , " etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boss as a " political realist . " Henry A. Kissinger came on modestly to say he could " only judge foreign policy pronounced vorin bolizy , where his Nixon 's impact . . . will be enormous . " Nixon seconding speeches were given by a nineteen-year-old Iowan who called Vietnam " the war for all Americans " ; Senator Buckley praised Nixon for that same strong national defense posture and his Supreme Court appointments which have " regained the confidence of America . " A United Automobile Workers official announced that the people of " Pittsburgh have asked me to come here to speak to you tonight " on behalf of Richard Nixon ; Mrs. Anne Bedsole of Alabama , ostensibly speaking for all Wallace voters , and the Democratic South , said , " We can not take George McGovern . " During all the talk , President Nixon slipped into a youth concert being presided over by middle-aged Sammy Davis , Jr. , a notorious hugger and habitual convert . Sammy , used to hugging the likes of " Dean , " " Frankie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stop at " Dick " ; he sneaked up behind the President , gave him an approving public hug which Nixon reacted to with a brave , smiling flinch that soon broke down into a cringe . Sammy , shortly after , began appearing in General Electric TV commercials , GE a flamboyantly pro-Nixon defense operation . Chuck Connors , John Wayne , and other Nixon supporters appeared in TV commercials sponsored by pro-Nixon corporations prohibited from making directcontributions to political campaigns . Next day , another winner , Spiro Agnew , was renominated , and Richard Nixon finally made his reappearance as the " partisan of principles that can unite us . " Nixon boasted , though not as ominously as post-Watergate connotations implied , " We have changed America and America has changed the world . " In the final fade-out Nixon and Agnew , intertwined , were singing " God Bless America " beside Roman Catholic Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia . The millionaires ' yachts floated out of the harbor . Planes took delegates out of town . Cars and buses left the Strip . Labor Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay not far ahead . The old folks did n't stay on pot much after their Spectacular sources left town . A few hippies stuck around when Nixon 's " Cubans " reinherited Miami Beach . Summer finally arrived two months late . Complainers could now complain Miami Beach was " real dead . " Once the last elephant banners and posters disappeared , cops put away their riot equipment , the national guard left , so did the army . Senior citizens could get into the Doral . Pelicansflew solitary sorties , unmenaced by hovering helicopters . Traffic thinned . Hookers , without Germaine Greer to hassle them , returned to monitoring salesman Johns and chintzy summer-conventioneers . Rental cars piled up in the airport lot . Only in Key Biscayne , the Republican cats who had swallowed the Democratic canaries held a great big party to celebrate the coming " Four More Years . " The guest of honor would soon announceto the world , " I am not a crook . " The Political Spectacular , begun in Miami Beach , ended there , P161too . To show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key Biscayne and went West , to a temporary San Clemente seclusion he could not possibly imagine , during that 1972 summer , would soon serve him as a permanent retreat.  |p165The  Huntington ( now the Huntington Sheraton ) Hotel in Pasadena is a Fitzgerald dream . For most of the year it just sits there , in a settled green setting ; chauffeured limousines drive up , drive away , their passengers either aged residents of the hotel or regular dining patrons ? their relatives , their visitors , their paid companions . The cars , even when forty years old , are always in what auctioneers call mint condition . So are the mink coats and mink collars the little old ladies and little old gentlemen of Pasadena wear mornings and evenings , even on the waiuiest summerdays . A 1972 octogenarian could have been a 1920s flapper , Hollywood party-goer , or Parisian dude . Some of the Huntington 's residents are almost the exact age Fitzgerald would have been , had he been one of the very rich and lived to a pampered ripeness . The shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bigger and posher in some other part of the country or Europe , the merchandise invariably marked " imported . " The Huntington Hotel is related to those torn-down grand hotels of Saratoga . It 's an ideal place to clip a coupon , check the Wall Street Journal , stretch out in a lawn chair ; it 's good for rest , good for diet , good for short views . Wheelchairs coast through its corridorsand lobbies . Canes are stylish , antique , not the usual invalid stuff from Abbey Rents . More often than not , the proffered arm of an attendant is ununiformed . The Huntington Hotel , for genteel old folks , is home . P166In the hotel and outside , the little old lady from Pasadena was sometimes a familiar political character , the little old lady in sneakers . Little old gentlemen wear sneakers , too , for the same good reason , to get the traction that protects brittle limbs from slips and falls . I saw one Huntington Hotel tiny old mink-topped guest hurrying along in brightly striped regulation NBA basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Rose Bowl week , when she and her elderly friends were all but blotted out by Big Ten and Pacific-8 Conference mesomorphs crunching in and out of the old hotel . Life in the Huntington Hotel did n't stop for the Rose Bowl , though as headquarters for the press and conference officials it became a slap-on-the-back cheery reunion frat house , playground for public relations people , conference officials , alumni nostalgics , and retired cheerleaders past their best handspring weight . The lobby was a crest of blazers , a gray of flannels , a repp of striped school ties , a dale carnegie of smilers . Woody Hayes and Ohio State were playing John McKay and USC in the 1972 Rose Bowl ? " wondrous Woody , " Paul Hornung , turned Columbus sportswriter after forced early retirement from the NFL , shamelessly called Hayes . The coaching confrontation was supposedly allegorical . Woody Hayes was a Vietnam hawk coach , a collegian 's own Vince Lombardi . Woody sometimes behaved like an army general in , say , Doctor Strangelove . John McKay was n't totally cynical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretend he was delighted to be playing a team rooted in nineteenth-century fundamentalist football fundamentals . After the game he and " wondrous Woody " somehow contrived not to meet for that " Well done , old man " minisecond midfield brush-by , a good thing , too , considering McKay 's unusual post-game press conference . To the print-out questions , " How'dja do it ? " etc. , McKay replied : " We just kicked their ass ; it 's that simple . " When some guy asked : " Did President Nixon call ? " " No , " McKay said , " and I did n't call him either . " The Huntington Hotel , days before the game , filled with Big Ten and Pacific-8 newspaper people . Outside it was sunny , warm ,  |p167inside  the pressroom dark , and bluish from a huge out-of-focus , weird-color TV screen . On screen was the take-off of some 1,400 planes recently returned from a routine bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong . The press people were all drinking gin and California orange juice , chewing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't an airplane commercial . They were waiting . Harry Truman 's funeral was going to be shown live on television . " Harry 's the one , " said a man wearing an Ohio State eyeshade , " Harry was the whole ball of wax . " " Harry taught the country to really stand up to the Communists , " said a man in a reddish T-shirt . " You got to give that little guy a lot of credit . " " Without Harry , our President today would n't be standing tall , " said the man in the eyeshade . " Real hardnosed , " a voice said from a corner , " look how Harry handled Uncle Joe Stalin . Nobody in the whole world could controlold Joe . Only old Harry . " " There 's a lot of old Harry in old Woody , " said the man in the eyeshade . Between Miami Beach 's political spectaculars and the Rose Bowl came the Munich Olympics , in September , live television guerrilla theater ending with dead Israelis and dead Palestinians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Richard Nixon was easily re-elected ? in spite of Watergate , the ITT disclosures , the milk fund disclosures , and war continuing in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia . The Los Angeles Times , a few days before the Rose Bowl , ran an Interlandi cartoon of Henry Kissinger flapping two empty sleeves and cackling his best one-liner , " Peace is at hand . " Telford Taylor and Joan Baez had just returned from Hanoi to describe the carpet bombing of North Vietnam and the destruction of Bach Mai Hospital . The Pentagon 's press spokesman , Jerry Friedheim , who always acted as if press briefings were interrupting an urgent trip to the men 's room , explained that any damage Taylor and Baez had seen was caused by North Vietnam missiles shooting into the sky ? and missing . The war had fortunately hung on long enough for the Tourna- ment of Roses grand marshal , John Wayne ? selected many months earlier ? not to have to be connected with anything as sissy as peace . The Tournament of Roses Committee had selected John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Movie Memories " parade theme . Everybody everywhere knew that John Wayne was hardnosed . Rose Bowl publicity outlined some of Duke Wayne 's qualificationsto be grand marshal of its pastoral flower show , among them the following awards : 1 . U.S. Government War Agencies Plaques2 . U.S. Marine Corps Iron Mike Award ( oddly characterized as the " highest award that can be given a civil-ian " ) 3 . American Legion Americanism Award4 . Veterans of Foreign Wars Americanism Award5 . West Point Society of Los Angeles Duty , Honor , Country AwardAn added homey touch told how hardnosed old Duke , when not making hardnosed movies , " gets away for fishing or just relaxing on his converted minesweeper , Wild Goose . " All the 1920s Fitzgerald dreams went into the making of a Rose Bowl spectacular ? football heroes , Hollywood splash , and the very rich living out their unaffected imitatio of royalty-at-play . Woody Hayes and Ohio State may have been a little crude for Fitzgerald 's Princeton-dropout taste . USC was perhaps a trifle too rah-rah for a West Coast world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team like Stanford . Unlike a Louisville transformed by the Kentucky Derby , or Indianapolisduring the weeks of the " 500 , " Pasadena proper was almostunrippled by the Rose Bowl . The Huntington Hotel was only one of the well-kept buildings and mansions that set Pasadena 's cool tone . In spite of commercial production numbers and punchoutpublicity programs , the Rose Bowl retained a closed " this is our thing " quality . The Tournament of Roses had headquarters on posh Orange Grove Boulevard in a huge mansion once the homep169of William Wrigley , the chewing-gum king . Wide green lawns on a tree-punctuated street kept the Rose Bowl tightly zoned for its white flannel and red-rosed officials . Pasadena cops in this setting gave the impression they were some private security force working this , as they did most well-heeled areas of the country , to discouragebreaking and entering , invasions of privacy , and the intrusion of that rough element so disruptive to millionaires ' neighborhoods . In 1973 , for instance , the city of Pasadena erected bleacher seats on a 300-foot parkway which , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unofficially ? occupied by local blacks living in the vicinity of the Rose Bowl . Elderly black people would be set up in seats early and be served food and hot drinks by young community blacks during the parade . The black community had established squatters ' rights to that particular spot in 1960 . The area they used had grown steadily till the 1972 Rose Bowl Parade , when about seventy people were accommodated . When the black community protested the disappearance of their seats , the city 's defense was that California freeway robbery took away about 10,000 parade seats . To cut that 10,000 by seventy " black community seats " seemed , to white Pasadena , only just and right . I asked one of those neat nice country-club white Pasadena cops why he thought the city had suddenly decided ? only a week before the parade ? to put up those bleachers . I wondered why nobody had told the black community what was happening . " Hell , they were killing Pasadena 's image , " the policeman said . " Some TV cameramen showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And noisy . Paying no real attention to the parade ? just drinking , and eating . Hell , my Daddy told me we never had Tobacco Road in Pasadena , even during the Depression , so why have it now ? Nobody wants to see a bunch of old Negroes bugaloo first thing New Year 's morning . " At a last-minute conference with Pasadena 's assistant city managerand the Tournament of Roses ' liaison man , the black communitysettled for sixty tickets in a reserved section that left no room for bugalooing . Pasadena did n't completely escape the violence ( and antiwar feeling ) of the rest of the country . During New Year 's Eve , whichpI70 was cold and harshly windy ? down to the low forties and high thirties ? athirty-three-year-old man stepped on the foot of a teenager . In the argument that followed the man was stabbed , and died an hour later in Huntington Memorial Hospital . In another incident , police rushed a group of fifty to sixty young people , and the usual response ? a " barrage of rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as the police called it . Part of the 1,100 force of Pasadena police and sheriff 's deputies had the riot well under controlby 3 A.M. , hours before John Wayne and Mrs. Richard Nixon took their places in the Pasadena fun parade . The Tournament of Roses Committee first announced on March 21 , 1972 , that the 1973 parade theme would be " Movie Memories . " Otis Blasingham , president of the Tournament , said , " When I looked back through our records I was astonished to find we 'd never had a movie theme before . " The official Tournament Association puff was bland : " We think Movie Memories ' will lend itself to a spectacular parade in ' 73 . All of us have fond memories of motion pictures . " If Michigan , with its big big big Big Ten band , could n't make the Rose Bowl , Ohio State , with its big big band , could , and did . Though Woody Hayes and Ohio State football had n't acknowledgedthe twentieth century , the " 0 " band gave signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pre-Altamont ) Woodstock cult had worked some changes in Columbus . Brushcuts had all but disappearedamong male band members : their sideburns were a little longer than a West Point cadet 's ; real mustaches sneaked in , even if rather thin and sketchy . Band women abandoned the tight tight perm . Continuity , however , was guaranteed by the fierce military uniforms , the franchised march patterns and unspontaneous play . Here , too , things looked wondrously allegorical ? the Midwest paramilitary spats-on-parade , the West Coast 's USC Trojan War costumes absurd as Ben Hur . Five firms ? Festival Artists , Floatmasters , Donald J. Bent , Coleman Enterprises , and Herrin-Preston ? made over 90 per cent of the floats in the Rose Parade . They were year-round commercialenterprises able to design , construct , and decorate the floats assigned to them . I was less interested in these commercial floats than I was inp171community involvement with the Rose Bowl . A couple of days before the parade I drove out to a tent on Mission Street where the South Pasadena float on the theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Mission Street community . It had financed the float , designed it , built it , and now was decorating it . Kids were up on the float , dozens of girls and boys around seven or eight , and lots more teenagers . It was a happy working crew of Michelangelohelpers up on scaffolding , covering chickenwire and wood , hollering for flowers , greens , and paint . Older people were working on " Pauline 's " rocking canoe of red camellias ; a steam engine bearing down was being covered with white and yellow chrysanthemums . Chunks of recently discarded Christmas tree added green and once-green touches to the float . A mother-of-eight rushed past me . " I 've got to hit them up again ? oh dear , those poor merchants . We 're always after them for something , doughnuts , Cokes , paper cups ? and money . They 're generous . We 're in this together . " Downey , California , had its own float association ; so did Burbankand Sierra Madre , and Cal Poly had an ongoing yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by those commercial float-builders or by outfits like Walt Disney Enterprises . The Mission Street kids behaved like professionals , craft workers who took their milk or Coke breaks with backs to the tent 's small food stand . Their eyes were constantly fixed on the rising " Perils of Pauline . " Nobody under the tent was a drone . Some swept the ground clear of snipped wire and cropped leaves . Others were either up on the scaffolds , climbing all over the frame , attachingor handing up and fetching . A few teenage girls sat at a sawhorse table wiring flowers together one by one . In the dump of a parking lot behind the tent , kids in imitation of some ABC " Wide World of Sports " special whizzed their bikes up an Evel Knievel ramp improvised out of warped boards leaned against a cementblock cesspool . From time to time a parent would run out of the tent to take down the dangerous boards , but in no time at all the kids would set up more warped lumber and the stunt driving would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wobbly wheel slipped off the boards and slammed him to the ground did the stunting stop . The boy , crying to himself , got up , looked at the rear bike wheel still pointlessly spinning , the bike frame and front wheel now a mess of twistage , then limped into the tent , sat down beside a crew of flower-wirers , who , without a word , handed him some work . Outside , the kids straightened the ramp boards and resumed their dangerous stunting . Through the day , mothers and older teenagers periodically left the tent to lead young children on a door-to-door canvas for nickels , dimes , quarters , and dollar bills . Excited , happy kids dumped jars and baskets of small change on the snack counters . Everyone cheered . During the year the float was being prepared , the Mission Street community raised money through raffles , cake and garage sales , small fairs , special community events . The Rose Parade had been going on longer than the Rose Bowl football game ? eighty-four years by 1973 ( to fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told ) . In that time traditions had been established , and some had disappeared . South Pasadena kept its community project going long after most others had either stopped participating , or had turned responsibility for floats over to the pros . Participation in the preparation was obviously as important to Mission Street as the Parade itself . Similarly , in Indianapolis , family traditions made the " 500 " trials as significant as the more famous race . Community participation in Mardi Gras made the day something privately special for New Orleans ' residents . Local communities , generally not caught up in the spirit of commercial rip-off , resent or ignore the invasion of their town by tourists , campfollowers , spectaculars nuts , and attendanthokery . Pasadena 's unique situation made the Tournament of Roses different from the other spectaculars in one significant way : Pasadena was located in the most thickly populated area of the United States , Southern California , and so did not depend on peoplefrom the rest of the country coming to its parade and game . Pasadena and Los Angeles were always automobile-oriented ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive parking problems and automobile-access problems . Pasadena 's traffic was just part of modern American automotive madness . Most people coming to the parade and the game lived within fiftyp173to eighty miles of Pasadena and did n't usually need hotels and motels . Tournament of Roses followers therefore did n't add much revenue to local commercial enterprises ? most of which were closed on New Year 's Day anyway . Trinkety souvenirs were part of the Rose Bowl package , peddledhalf-heartedly , almost as an afterthought . Just as the Tournamentof Roses Parade comfortably considered itself the " granddaddyof all parades , " so the Rose Bowl , confidently the " granddaddy of all football bowl games , " had a relaxed national stance . Being " Number One " among bowl games was more than an honorary designation and kept the Rose Bowl , and its parade , Number One in lucrative television network contracts . The Rose Bowl and its parade had the highest and most pleasurable " identification " rating in the nation . Like the Kentucky Derby , the Rose Bowl was hardly affected , nationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl could say its parade began in 1890 , its football championship in 1902 ( Michigan vs . Stanford ) . Or it could stress continuity by giving 1916 , its second start , as the origin of continuousNew Year 's Day play . It could be even more modest and choose 1923 , when the Rose Bowl was first set in Pasadena , as its true beginnings . Generosity was easy . No matter how Pasadena counted , its rivals lagged far behind . The Orange Bowl ( originally called the Palm Festival ) did n't get started till 1933 , did n't move into Miami 's Orange Bowl Stadium till 1935 . The Sugar Bowl , played in New Orleans ' Tulane Stadium , also began on January 1 , 1935 ; the Cotton Bowl , in Dallas , did n't start till 1937 , and its current practice ? of automatically sending the Southern Conferencechampions to the Cotton Bowl ? was n't set policy until 1941 . The Sun Bowl began in El Paso , Texas , in 1935 as a Texas high school game ( switching to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jacksonville , Florida , began in 1946 ; Houston 's BluebonnetBowl ( named after the real ? not " yellow rose " ? state flower of Texas ) began in 1959 , the same year that the Liberty Bowl was played in Philadelphia for the first time ( it moved to Memphis in 1965 ) . The Rose Bowl obliquely dramatized an American sport allegory Fitzgerald and , in his own way , Hemingway would havep174recognized : the private gentlemen 's colleges , best exemplified by the Ivy League , and even better by the Big Three ? Harvard , Yale , Princeton ? acknowledged one West Coast institution , Stanford . The University of Southern California was too big , too new , allegedlytoo lax in its academic standards , too Hollywood and flapper to be considered a serious Stanfordian enterprise . Then there were the public state universities . The 1902 game between Michigan and Stanford , which ended with Michigan winning , 49-0 , was a contemporary boys ' book view of life . Stanford was full of good young men from good families : Percival Percival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles and white flannels and tennis sweater marked with the scarlet letter , " S , " before the midwestern state university unacademic ringers fell on him and pounded him unconscious . State university toughs outweighed him , outnumberedhim , outcrafted him in a tasteless demonstration of what nobrowgashouse democracy could do physically to America 's gentlemanlyaristocrats . In the boys ' books the gentlemen always won : in the record books they had the shit kicked out of them . Once , in 1920 , when the last Ivy League team to make its appearance in the Rose Bowl , Harvard , was ostensibly being beaten by the University of Oregon , the referees called Oregon 's lastsecondvictorious field goal " wide , " and gentlemanly Harvard won for the upper classes its last allegorical do-or-die tussle with the western masses . That other aspect of the Rose Bowl game , the contest between the " East " and the " West , " stood as the Rose Bowl formula till 1947 when the Big Ten-Pacific Coast Conferencegame was established . The Rose Bowl leaves little to chance . Add the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California ? or along the West Coast : schools with annual enrollments of between 20,000 and 45,000 ( plus old-school-tie part-timers ) can take up most of the 104,500 ( 1973 capacity ) Rose Bowl seats in no time at all . The Rose Bowl , with this alumni base , does n't have to get into the business promotion game that works so well for the KentuckyDerby , the Indianapolis " 500 , " or the upstart professional Super Bowl . Using its television ratings and the commercial **25;1967;TOOLONG of its parade , it can charge 1972 parade rates of $32,000 a minute , and sell Rose Bowl game commercial time atp175$135,000 a minute . Market research claimed that of every ten TV sets tuned to the parades in 1971 , eight followed the Rose Parade ; in 1972 , seven out of ten were said to be tuned to the Rose Parade . The audience was stated as 110,000,000 , making the Rose Bowl and its parade easily the most successful commercial spectacular in the country . More than any other spectacular , too , the Tournament of Roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nostalgia , celebrities ( including sports superstars ) , regionalism ( equestrian teams big on the Old West theme , and bigger yet on expensive old Mexican and American silver saddles ) , free enterprise , right-of-center politics ( while claiming to be nonpartisanand nonpolitical ) .

Dean , Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson ( the only cabinet minister and the only department ever represented ) , Captain Eddie Rickenbacker ( Eastern Airlines and numerous far-right organizations ) , Commander Perry Brown of the American Legion , Walt Disney , Billy Graham ; and , representing the " center , " Paul G.

Nielsen sued him , and in the ensuing court action some fascinating facts came to light . It seems that some days prior to the prime-time telecast of a special program starring Carol Channing and produced by Ms. Channing 's husband , Charles Lowe , some sixty residents of Ohio and Pennsylvania received letters from Sparger soliciting their comments on the commercials that were scheduled to appear in the program . Along with the letter went a cash paymentof three dollars , with the promise that an additional five dollars would be sent to anyone who answered and returned the enclosed questionnaire in an envelope ( also enclosed ) which was addressed to a New York City post office box . The sixty recipients were Nielsen guinea pigs . Obviously , the recipients could n't watch the commercials if they did n't tune in to the program . If all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional five dollars ) , the total tune-in would account for between five and six rating points in the national Nielsen report . Although Lowe said he never intended to artificially boost the rating , he admitted having paid Sparger four thousand dollars " simply to obtain an evaluation of the effectiveness of the program . Because Sparger boasted that he had " kited " the ratings a number of times before without Nielsen 's knowledge , the ratingservice brought suit against him . It was settled when Sparger withdrew his claim that he had gotten away with many cases of successful tampering . The fascinating question is how Sparger got the names of the supposedly confidential list of Nielsen subjects . At one point , it was suggested that it was as simple as his following a Nielsen field man on his rounds . The rating-service executives alleged that he had stolenp41the list from the field man 's automobile . In the settlement , Sparger admitted only that he had obtained the names by " improperor illegal means . " Meanwhile , the air was filled with rumors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quoted an unnamed network vice-president as saying that his network knew the location of four hundred Nielsen homes .

It is far easier to patch in the network and have a full day and night 's programming . I do not blame stations for preferring that course of life . I would myself In fact , we try out best to make this an attractive way of life . " ? Frank Stanton , president of CBS , before the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce in 1954The networks alone do not make up the television world . There are many other elements , the most noticeable of whichare stations , program producers , and advertisers . Shouldn'tthey bear equal responsibility for the conduct of the industryand for what appears on America 's television screens ? Eachnetwork has two hundred station affiliates , some of which areowned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest newspaper and magazine publishingchains . The ranks of the television-program producers includeall the major motion-picture companies , some of whichare backed by mammoth conglomerates like Gulf and Western , Warner Communications , and Transamerica Corporation . The advertisers comprise all of America 's corporate giants , 42p43some of the largest and most powerful concentrations of capitalin the world . Can it be that all of these parties , when they do business with a network , are dominated by the network ? Since the stations are a network 's bedrock , let 's first examine the affiliate relationship . Initially , the association rested on a contract whereby the network agreed to act as agent or trustee for the station in selling the station 's time to advertisers , and the station agreed to telecast whatever programs the network sent to it during specified hours each day . The relationship between the networks and their affiliated stations has been changing throughout television history . The Federal Communications Commission , which licenses all stations , limits any single owner to five VHF transmitters . As a result , fifteen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned and operated by the three networks . All three chains own stations in New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago , the three biggest cities . CBS fills out its quota with the fourth largest market , Philadelphia , and St. Louis ( twelfth ) . ABC owns the sixth and seventh largest , Detroit and San Francisco . NBC has the eighth and ninth , Cleveland and Washington . The CBS- and ABC-owned stations reach 22.8 percent and the NBC-owned stations reach 21.9 percent of all televisionhomes in the United States . Television stations obtain their revenue by selling their sole commodity , time , to advertisers . Buoyed by the strength of their owned and operated stations , and pursuing practices they had established in radio , the networks emerged as national sales agents for the stations with whom they contracted as affiliates . And they were exactly that , agents or brokers who arrangedwith national advertisers for nationwide televisionp44exposure . In the beginning , the networks did not control programmingother than news , sports , and public-service productions . The advertiser owned his program ; most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sought to make sure that he could buy time and get the programwith which he wanted to be identified on the stations he wanted . The network did this for the advertiser by clearing with the station and collecting from the advertiser an amount of money based on what the station charged for its time . The network collected a handsome percentage of the fee for its services , and a goodly sum went to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for the use of its lines . The station owner wound up with about 30 percent of the amount he would ask from a local advertiser if he was selling the time on his own , but he did n't complain . After all , he got a good show without having either to produce or pay for it . He did n't have to send salesmen out to solicit advertising ; he simply had to press a button . By 1959 , when television was about twelve years old , the networks were well into the process of removing the advertiser from any position of power in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own or control shows , and they squelched any further notion that an advertiser had about his " franchise " or his right to any time period : the networks producedor bought the programs . They still sold sponsorship rights to whole series , charging the buyer separately for the show and for time based on the aggregate of station rates , so matters stayed on an even keel insofar as the stations were concerned . The only difference was that now the network was furnishingthe broadcaster a commodity as well as a sales service . Recently the networks have refined the sales operation andp45increased their profit at the expense of the broadcaster by ceasingto sell shows or segments to a sponsor . A network sells commercialannouncements of thirty or sixty seconds ' duration , and its charges bear no relation to the affiliated stations ' rate cards . Advertisers pay , as we have seen , on the basis of **27;1994;TOOLONG , and as a successful show climbs in the ratings the price of announcements increases accordingly . The stations and the producer get the glory while the network gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agent ; it is the station 's supplier . It is in a position to drive a hard bargain , and it does . Until fifteen years ago , the affiliation contract required the station to take all network offerings during favored time segments . This period of mandatory clearance , which was called option time because the affiliate " optioned " its time during such intervals to the network , was abolished by an FCC order in the mid-sixties so that affiliated stations could use the freed time for nonnetwork programming , an expectation that proved illusory . Network programming is sent to the affiliates electronically from network headquarters or " master control . " There is an alternatesource of programming , delivered manually on a station-by-stationbasis , known as " syndication . " Syndication can encompass all forms of programming except that which is done live , that is , performances that are broadcast while being performed . In television 's earlier days there was considerable " live " broadcasting . Some programming was on film , but the remainderwas seen while it was actually performed . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primetimeschedules , except for certain fast-breaking news andp46sports events . While ordinary newscasts are done live , the only part of the show that is not usually prerecorded is the newscasterhimself , who watches the camera and reads script ; the visual parts of the normal newscast are either filmed or taped on location prior to the broadcast . In any event , " live action " is now extremely rare during prime time . The use of tape or film has a number of advantages over the old-fashioned live show . It can be cut and edited to remove mistakes , it can be reduced to exactly the required running time , it can be played at the same " clock time " in each of the four time zones of the country ( in the early days of television , an eight o'clock show originating in the East would be seen at five o'clock on the West Coast ) . Most important , the filmed or taped program can be run and rerun at later dates , giving it what the trade calls residual value . Although the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnected cable or microwave relay for " simultaneousnetwork telecast , " the almost universal use of tape and film for entertainment programs has , to a large extent , made simultaneous transmission unnecessary . Independent stations that are not affiliated with any network ( and this includes many UHFs as well as the independent VHFs in the fifteen cities we have already referred to ) get their staple programming in the form of directly delivered film and tape . The independent station , not being connected with any other , must rely on syndication , except for the live shows it can afford to produce for purely local consumption . There are three types of syndicated programming . There is " first-run " programming , which is produced specifically for syndication . It includes talk shows like those presided over by Mery Griffin and Mike Douglas , some game strips , and thep 47half-hour programming created for the " prime time access period . " ( In the early 1970s the Federal Communications Commissiondecreed that on weeknights the affiliated stations in the fifty largest cities could not accept more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; since most of these stations ran news at 7:00 P.M. , this left the halfhourstarting at 7:30 P.M. Eastern Time for syndicated or localshows , a segment of the day known as the prime-time accessperiod . ) The bulk of syndicated programming is " off - network " shows . These are network series that won large audiences and stayed on the network long enough ( usually four or five years or more ) so that there were sufficient episodes to be " stripped . " The third form of syndicated programming consists f old movies that were made for theaters and are now sold for t Levi sion viewing . They may or may not have previously run on one of the networks . Ever since the FCC ruled that it is illegal for a station to oplionits time to a network , it has been possible for an affiliated station to substitute a syndicated program or series it might want for an undesirable network show . But any such independenceon the part of an affiliate makes a network extremely unhappy . After all , the network has sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of a dollarcost for each thousand viewers , and the subtraction of viewersis financially damaging to it . Most useful to the network is the economic threat inherent in the fact that network affiliationis of tremendous monetary value to a television station . Not only is there a steady stream of expensively produced programminggeared to attract the largest part of the most desirablemass audience , not only are there ready-made national sponsors who have already bought and paid for the station 's time , but there is freedom from the predicament of trying to program on a local basis with an ever-dwindling supply of new material . Because of attractive network programming the independentstation that is trying to compete with the affiliate finds its audience diminishing , and as its audience diminishes it must cut its time charges . With less money coming in , the stationhas less to spend on programming . And as this circle works its way round and round , the independent station finds itself relegated to a second-rate position in the market . The contrast , which applies not only to struggling UHF stationsbut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , when the sets-in-use figure jumps from 30 percent to 60 percent . The advertising-agency account executivemeasures what he can spend for an announcement by the number of desired viewers that his commercial will reach . This in turn depends on the popularity of the program in which his announcement is placed or to which it is adjacent . With the network 's monopoly of " attractive " air time , the independent stations simply can not find programming that can compete . Many metropolitan stations today do n't bother to publish a " rate card , " the traditional price list prepared for the buyers and the advertising agencies . This is because they now sell on a cost-per-viewer basis . The station estimates its rating and the buyer pays accordingly ; if the program fails to fulfill the station'sguess , the advertiser gets a " make-good " ? that is , the stationowes him the difference in rating points and makes it up to him with additional announcements without further charge . But where the old-fashioned rate-card is still published , it shows dramatically the dollar value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest rate for a 30-second announcementin 1976 on the ABC-owned station was $5,000 ;  |p49on  the CBS-owned station it was $5,250 ; and on the NBCownedstation it was $6,000 . The rates for the equivalent spot on the four nonnetwork VHF stations were $500 , $600 , and two at $400 . In New York , the NBC-owned station 's 30-second prime-time spot was listed at $10,000 , with independent VHF station WPIX at $865 , and independent WOR at $600 . In Chicago , where there is only one independent VHF , WGN-TV , the equivalent listed rate was $1,250 in contrast to the $5,400 of the NBC station . Clearly , a network affiliation represents tremendous dollar value for a television station ; the network 's power over its affiliatescan be judged accordingly . There are many illustrations of this but perhaps none so dramatic as the historic confrontation between NBC and the giant Westinghouse Corporation . The case began twenty years ago and involved a decade of legal maneuvers , including a decision by the United States Supreme Court . The problem was the logical consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than five VHF televisionstations . NBC had assumed that there was nothing to prevent it from owning and operating its stations in any five markets it chose . Naturally it chose the big ones . ( There is more money to be made in the larger markets because there are more viewers , and it does n't cost any more for equipment to build the station or power or personnel to run it . ) Prior to 1956 , NBC owned VHF television stations in New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Cleveland , and Washington . New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago were the three largest cities in America . The next largest city after Chicago is Philadelphia . The NBC affiliate in Philadelphia was owned and operated by the WestinghouseBroadcasting Corporation . Westinghouse had owned the NBC radio affiliate for many years , but not until 1953 did it acquire the television station from the Philco Corporation , for $8.5 million . Westinghouse and Philco had agreed that $5 million of the sum was the value of the affiliation with NBC at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than justified this allocation . In 1955 , NBC decided to exchange its Cleveland station for the more profitable Philadelphia station . The network proposedthat Westinghouse give up Philadelphia and take over Cleveland , and receive a $3 million payment as a sort of consolationprize . Westinghouse resisted this proposition , but NBC made it clear that it had previously been offered the opportunity to acquire another Philadelphia station and that it would prefer the Westinghouse outlet . The Westinghouse people later told the FCC that the acquisition by NBC of its own radioand television stations in Philadelphia would , of course , mean the end of NBC affiliation for the Westinghouse stations and the loss of that part of the $8.5 million purchase price designatedas the value of the affiliation . The element of coercion was plain . As the chief of the FCC 's Broadcast Bureau later said , " The vital force of a major network affiliation hung constantlyover these negotiations , exerting its own pressure without ever expressly coming to the forefront . " The Westinghouse people were disturbed by what their president described as a " muscling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of network affiliation were such that even this powerful companybelieved that submission would be the better part of valor . The Westinghouse president later testified that " much as Westinghouse disliked the situation they found themselves in , there was not much they could do except to get the best deal they could from NBC and since it was clear that Philadelphia was NBC 's real objective it was decided to bargain for the bestp51possible advantages in exchange for Cleveland . " Westinghouse accordingly joined with NBC in asking the FCC to approve the swap . Although two of the commissioners said they were bothered by the glaring circumstance that " the expiration of the NBC affiliation agreement triggered the negotiations which led to the transfer , " the others noted that Westinghouse had said it was exercising a prudent business judgment , and the FCC gave its approval . So NBC took over Philadelphia and Westinghouse was relegated to Cleveland . There were stirrings , however , within the Department of Justice , and after little more than a year had passed , the government filed a complaint against NBC asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act . The attorney general charged that the network had conspired to grab ownership of stations in five of the eight largest cities in the country " by the unlawful use of the power of the Defendant NBC , as a network , to grant or withhold from nonnetwork station owners , NBC network affiliation for their television stations . " The case wound its way to the Supreme Court , the lawyers debating whether or not the courts could hear an antitrust case after an FCC decision . The high tribunal held that the federal courts certainly could go into this question despite the FCC action , and sent the case back for the taking of evidence . By this time NBC had had enough . The network was understandablywary of any judicial investigation of its monopoly and how it was using it . NBC entered into a consent decree whereby it agreed to sell the Philadelphia outlet after an allottednumber of years and pick up its fifth station somewhere else . Even so , it was n't until 1965 that NBC withdrew its attempt to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swap , moving back to Cleveland . By this time ,  |p52according  to the experts , the Philadelphia affiliation value had increased from $5 million to $20 million , and it probably carriesfrom two to four times that value today . When loss of network affiliation can induce a giant corporationsuch as Westinghouse to abandon the nation 's fourth-largesttelevision market rather than remain there without network affiliation , the pressure that networks can bring to bear upon affiliates in clearing programs becomes self-evident . However much a local affiliate might prefer to exercise independentjudgment in selecting competitive programs over networkfare , the station can not afford network disfavor , which could place its affiliation in jeopardy . There is a maxim in the industry that the courage of a network-affiliated station is shown in inverse ratio to the number of stations in the market . For example , in a city with only two broadcasters both can be extremely brave , for the network has no place to go . In a threestationmarket , courage will be shown only by the affiliate of the lowest ranking of the three networks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relegated to the bottomspot . In any city where there are four VHF stations nobodyshows any courage , because fear of losing the affiliation to the hungry independent is a constant . ( This would not apply to New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago , because all of the affiliatesin those cities are owned and operated by the networks , and by definition the owned-and-operated station does n't do anything that its owner does n't want it to do . ) The cost of producing a syndicated program or series must approach that of producing a prime-time network show , if the two are to compete for the audience on equal terms . In order to recoup that amount of money the syndicator must be able to sell his show to stations in all the major cities at the high pricep53that is available only if the program runs in prime time . If the affiliated stations are afraid to preempt in prime time , the syndicatedshow can not survive . There simply are not enough nonnetwork stations able to pay for entertainment of a quality to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on program preemption by their affiliates has developed simultaneously with a steady growth in the use of station time by the networks . In 1960 the three national networks programmed 434 half-hours weekly on a combined regularly scheduled basis . By 1976 that figure had climbed to 540 , virtually all of which were cleared by affiliates . This increase occurred despite the advent , in the fall of 1971 , of the prime-time access rule , which gave twenty-one halfhoursback to the stations . As a matter of fact , from 1972 to 1976 , network programming grew by 46.5 half-hour units per week . Most damaging to other elements of the industry has been the networks ' tireless appropriation of prime time , much of which had been accomplished by the early 1960s . Before then the networks used from 8:00 P.M. to 10:30 P.M. ( Eastern Time ) , which left available 7:00 to 8:00 , and 10:30 to 11:00 . During the 1950s these time periods were usually programmed with first-run syndicated half-hour shows ; during those years an average of thirty new syndicated half-hour series were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these time slots , the producers of syndicated programming dropped out of business , one by one , until by the end of the 1960s there were literally no first-run syndicated programs beingproduced for the attractive evening hours . There was no way , as we have seen , for the producers to get enough moneyp54from the limited number of viable independent stations to pay production costs . The elimination of the first-run syndication business had a domino effect that redounded further to the networks ' benefit . By removing a source of quality programming it lowered the independent stations on the competitive scale . Even the few prosperous nonnetwork VHF stations in the largest cities were compelled to adopt strip programming in prime time , trying without much success to compete with their network peers by offering daily sets of off-network repeats , game shows , and lowbudgettalk shows . ( Talk shows prosper by sufferance of the talent unions who have ruled that guest stars are essentially interviewees , and are , therefore , allowed to appear at the low union minimum rather than at their customary high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress expressedconcern about the demise of prime-time syndication . As far back as 1956 they had been warned about what would happen . Richard M. Moore , at that time manager of KTTV , an independent VHF station in Los Angeles , testified that " access to the public 's most convenient viewing hours is effectively barred by the networks to local and nonnetwork program sources and local and nonnetwork advertisers ; and the choice of what the American public may see during these most convenienthours is effectively determined by unilateral decisions at the network headquarters in New York . " He accurately predictedthat first-run syndicated programming would " shrink and disappear , and independent television stations like KTTV will be unable to obtain access to the few high-quality films that may still be produced . If independent stations can not obtainaccess to such programs , the stations ' potential for service to their communities will be destroyed . "  |p55Congressional  committees came and went . The FCC 's NetworkStudy Group investigated the problem for eight years , much of which time was spent taking testimony . The first concretestep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access rule . In order to truly encourage alternative program sources , the commission prohibited the use of off-networkreruns during the new access period , such provision to go into effect in 1972 . ( The rule was later amended to free Sundaysfrom its operation . ) The new rule opened up a half-hour on each of six nights , because most affiliates utilized the news exception . With three networks this looked like space for eighteennew half-hour weekly series ? a step in the right direction . However , there were many problems . In the first place , one purpose of the rule was to free the producers of the new shows from the network stranglehold . As a matter of practical financing , no syndicated show that carries a respectably high price tag can succeed unless it is sold in New York and Los Angeles . As we have seen , however , because they had been unable to get this type of series for over fifteen years , the independent stations in New York and Los Angeles had developed the practice of stripping . Suddenly faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 8:00 P.M. , and not being subject to the prohibition against off-network reruns during that half-hour , the independent stations were n't about to change this habit . The consequence was that the reborn producerfound himself unable to market his series unless he got a deal from the network stations in the top two cities . These , of course , are owned and operated by the networks themselves . So the producer could n't even get started with his show withoutthe okay of one of the networks , albeit a different branch of the company from the one he used to see . In the second place , by making the access period the samep56on every night and on every network , the FCC inadvertently created a low-budget-show ghetto . It was assumed that because a program is syndicated it must cost less to produce than one that is sent over network transmission , presumably becauseof higher distribution expense . While there is some truth in this , the difference is exaggerated in many an expert mind , and no account is taken of production-cost savings . In any event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accessprograms would compete only against other access programs , not against network fare . They have , therefore , tended to consist mainly of game shows , nature or " animal " shows , and a few modest variety shows . There was no need for this to happen . The period could have been decreed one that must differ frc m network to network . It could have been placed at different times and perhaps on different days , maybe not always a half-hour in length . In this way the syndicated and local programs would compete with network shows , as they did in the earlier days of television , often with marked success , thus putting a. premium on creativity and encouraging the imaginativeexercise of American production talent . Third , the 7:30 to 8:00 P.M. time period is the most difficult for new programming . Since TV sets are often controlled by children at this hour , an attempt is made to produce a show that a child will prefer but that is not so unbearable that Mommy wo n't stay in the room to watch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eighteen and fortynine ) . This is called " bi-modal " or " kidult " programming , the distinguishing features of which are sentimentality and blandness . The selection of the 7:30 time period was actually worked out by the networks . Assuming that the half-hour must be either at the beginning or end of prime time , they preferred top57give up 7:30 to 8:00 rather than 10:30 to 11:00 , because the earlier slot had traditionally been more difficult to sell . No one network dared let a rival start networking first , on the theory that this would give it an unbeatable head start ( the flow-ofaudiencetheory ) , but once all three had agreed to make it 7:30 , the matter was settled . Although Don McGannon , president of the Westinghouse stations , had been agitating for the new rule for some time before 1971 , it was believed that FCC did n't act until it was pretty well satisfied that the networks were not really opposed to the rule . They had had a relatively slow year for sales in 1970 , and 7:30 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette commercials , which was about to go into effect , would account for about the same amount of commercial time that the rule would take away from the networks ' inventory . One of the networks , ABC , favored Prime-Time Access from the beginning . NBC at first opposed it , then did a switch and dropped its obstruction . Only CBS consistently opposed it , but even CBS appeared to back down when it announced that , despite its objection to the rule , there should be no change untiltwo years later . Television stations are themselves little monopolies . The control of an exclusive VHF franchise in any American city is a prize of great value . The broadcaster , however , does n't own the right to operate a station . It is licensed to him by the people of the United States acting through the FCC , and the licensemust be renewed every three years . The kind-hearted members of the FCC , however , have consistently renewed televisionstation licenses , their only refusals being for a repeated violation of technical rules resulting in the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV stations in major cities going as high as thirty times annual earnings . What is really being sold is a monopoly that the seller does n't legally own but which is treated as though he does . The one instance of a station 's being forced off the air withouttechnical violations is the famous case of Boston 's Channel 5 . This was no failure to renew , since no license had ever been granted . The publisher of the Boston Herald-Traveler was operatingthe station on a temporary permit , which was contested by two other applicants . The litigation lasted seventeen years , the longest regulatory case in American history . Some of the evidence had to do with the propriety of a controversial offthe-recordlunch that the president of the operating company had with the chairman of the FCC , which is why Sterling Quinlan entitled his book about the case The Hundred Million Dollar Lunch . The book answers in detail the question " How do you blow one hundred million dollars , seventeen years of legal wrangling , two million dollars in legal expenses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The station had been making more money than the newspaper lost , so three months after the station 's demise the Herald joined it in the graveyard . ) A more typical case involved the license renewal for WPIXTV , the New York City independent station associated with the New York Daily News . This case occupied the FCC for nine years . WPIX 's license had been challenged in 1969 on grounds of alleged distortion of the news in televised reports . During the 1968 anti-Soviet uprising in Czechoslovakia , the station had credited news reports to cities where the action was rather than where the reporter was broadcasting . It was also alleged that WPIX had filmed a tank in Fort Belvoir , Virginia , as if it were in Vietnam 's central highlands , and that the station had superimposed the legend " via satellite " over newsp59film that had been delivered by express . The challengers believed that such actions constituted efforts to " deceive station viewers " and were " an attempt to hype news ratings ? it was simply a matter of greed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attention of the president and general manager of the station , his response was to fire the reporterwho told him about it . In June 1978 the FCC renewed the WPIX license . The vote was four to three . The majority did not go along with their administrativelaw judge , who had taken the position that to be concerned with falsification and misrepresentation of the news would be a violation of the station 's First Amendment rights , but it did say that news distortion and inadequate supervision did not involve misdeeds of sufficient importance to warrant denial of renewal . It is interesting to note that even had the decision gone the other way WPIX would have already enjoyednine years of extremely profitable operation after the time of challenge , and its certain subsequent appeal to the courts would have involved more time , perhaps even approachingthe seventeen years that the Boston station managedafter the time of its original application . As we have noted , in the early days of television the networksacted as a clearinghouse and collected the station 's share of the sponsor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointly agreed on what the share should be , based on the station 's regularly charged rates . " We are partners in a joint venture , " was the way NBC president Robert Sarnoff put it . Later , when the networks took control of program production , they charged the advertiser separately for " time and talent , " " talent " meaning production , and the " time " charge being based on the aggregate of what the stations would get , in addition to miscellaneous expenses like line charges and overhead . The network , in other words , was still considered a conduitbetween the advertiser and the stations . If , then , the actual expense of operating the network went up , it followed that this expense would be taken out of the payments to the local stations . In 1969 when A.T . &T.; raised its charges to the networks for long-distance transmission of programs , the cost increase was passed on to the affiliates in the form of an immediatedecrease in their network compensation rates . After all , a clearinghouse took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today the system has changed . The networks sell 30- to 60-second announcements , not programs that cover a half-hour or an hour of desirable time . Experts argue about the reasons for the change . Under the old system advertisers benefited from the identification with a popular entertainment . The very name was a boon to the sponsors of the " Texaco Star Theater , " the " Firestone Hour , " the " Kraft Music Hall , " the " Kaiser MuminumHour , " and the " Lucky Strike Hit Parade . " When the advertiser lost the opportunity to coproduce or buy his chosen show , and when he could no longer " own " his pet time period , much of his advantage disappeared . Rising costs may also have had something to do with the change ; between 1960 and 1976 , the average cost to produce a half-hour prime-time series episodejumped by about 237 percent from $49,000 to $165,000 , and the cost of a 30-second prime-time network announcement increased by 153 percent , which may have been somewhat higher than the normal rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that they got more bang-for-abuckout of a lot of short announcements spread over the dial than out of a few longer but more concentrated commercials . They said that the quickie plugs were " more cost effective . " p 61Whether or not these Madison Avenue conclusions were rationalizationsto support a new plan that the networks found most attractive for themselves , it does seem true that some adagencyaccount executives welcomed the change because it absolvedthem of the responsibility of making rough decisions . When an advertiser fully sponsored a series , he put all his eggs in one basket , and woe to the agency genius who suggested what turned out to be a bad basket . The new system took a lot of relieved admen off the spot . The networks were characteristically quick on the uptake . They were in full control of the programming , the time , and the stations . They had eliminated the roles formerly played by advertisers and agencies . They no longer had to " represent " or be " partners " with stations . The price of announcements was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased in popularity , the advertiser would pay more ? and the network could keep the difference . There is a set station-rate per announcement , so there is no obligation to increase payment to the stations . The money the network pays the station for carrying a show no longer has to be related to what the advertiser pays ; it can simply be one of the network 's business expenses . Today the network sets the figure it will use in calculating the payment for each commercial announcement carried by the affiliate . Networks pay nothing for any commercial minutesthat are not sold . The station receives less compensation even though the overall program time taken by the network remainsthe same . This change was immediately reflected in network profit figures . Total network income in 1971 was $53.7 million . By 1972 it had leapt to $110.9 million , a 107 percent increase . By 1973 it was $184.8 million , a jump of 67 percent . By 1974 ,  |p62|profits  reached the $200 million mark , and they were recorded at $208.5 million in 1975 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1977 , $406.1 million , a 37 percent rise . From the network 's point of view , the process has been simplified . If a series is not a ratings success , the network drops it . If it is a hit , the money rolls in and the network keeps the money . If the show becomes a favorite it stays on for a number of years . The network pays a little more money to the producer each year under the " escalation " clause in the production contract ? about5 percent . The network may have to sweeten the fee paid to the star who threatens to break his contract ( and hence ruin the show ) unless he gets more money , but in the overall production cost this boosts the total by only a few percentagepoints . The network pays the affiliated stations no more for the time ; the stations must be content with the fact that a hit show improves their ratings and raises the value of commercial announcements that are adjacent to the network program or are available during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the network price increases commensurate with the increase in the size of the audience . The Westinghouse stations , in their petition to the FCC , allegedthat a large portion of the newly accumulated network wealth has accrued at the expense of the affiliates . During the ten years in which the networks ' income rose from $92 million to $225 million , a 143 percent increase , the total compensation they paid their affiliates fell 2.3 percent , a $6 million drop . This looks more startling when you see that in 1974 the networks gave the stations less than 14 percent of the broadcasters ' revenue , whereas in 1964 the figure was more than 23 percent . The affiliated stations have other complaints . They allege that their own networks are now competing with them in sell/ing commercials to national advertisers for regional coverage by undercutting the price . They claim this happens because the networks have reduced their compensation and have been accepting orders for 30-second messages instead of insisting on the 1-minute minimum . ( Between 1967 and 1974 , the number of commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 105,600 , while the number of availableannouncements jumped from 103,000 to 170,400 . ) In addition to encroachments upon time previously allotted for station use , the networks have recently been increasing the amount of commercial time sold by them during prime-time programs . The National Association of Broadcasters , through its Code of Fair Practice , has established that the proper amount of time for commercial announcements during primetimeshould be six minutes per hour . A few years ago the networksadded another minute per hour for movies because of what they styled the " high cost of theatrical features . " During the past one or two years they have applied this rule to practically every prime-time program longer than one hour . This includesminiseries , movies made for television , and even the longer versions of regular series episodes . Fearing that this trend would continue , President Donald McGannon of Westinghouse notified the three networks on January 14 , 1978 , that the Westinghouse stations ( two affiliatedwith CBS , two with NBC , and one with ABC ) would refuse to run any commercial announcements that exceeded the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace them with public-service or public-affairs announcements . He said that he was afraid that there would soon be four commercialminutes instead of three in each prime-time half-hour , which would increase the total network income by $570 millionper year , a figure based on the estimate that the 1977 net/work revenues were $3.422 billion , of which prime time representsabout half . CBS 's " Saturday Night Movie " scheduled for May 20 , 1978 , was Hannie Calder . Carrying out his threat , McGannon ordered the Westinghouse stations to delete one of the commercialannouncements and substitute a public-service announcement . CBS retaliated by refusing to send Hannie Calder to its two Westinghouse affiliates . Westinghouse stated that they believed the amount of non-program time being used by CBS was excessive . " The two-hour period from 9:00 to 11:00 P.M. was formatted by CBS to include 14 minutes of networkcommercial time and 2 minutes of local commercial time within a 93-minute movie which was followed by 11 consecutiveminutes of promotional announcements for other CBS programs . We concluded this amount of non-program time was excessive and contrary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven minutes of promotional materialraised a " philosophical question " inasmuch as such material is " akin in nature to commercials themselves . " To reducethe entertainment portion of a two-hour prime-time programto an hour and thirty-three minutes certainly makes TV watching that much less attractive , while diluting the value of what the station has to sell to the individual advertiser . Many affiliated stations feel that the present system makes it impossible for them to carry out properly their responsibilities as license holders . The FCC has consistently said that the local station is ultimately responsible for what goes out over the air ; the station can not defer responsibility to the network or any other entity , such as an advertiser . Under the law the station licensee is required to program " in the public interest , " withp 65regard for the special needs and desires of the local community . What may be suitable in New York or Los Angeles might be unacceptable in other cities . Yet there is little chance to exercisethis policy as long as the networks supply the programming . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because those same stations do not review most of the shows prior to broadcast , it is practically impossible for the affiliates to carry out the localism rule . The network often receives a program only a day or two before it is aired . Clearly there is little time for affiliates to obtainand schedule substitute programming in the event they decide against the network show . But there is no reason why programs must be delivered at the last minute . Most programs are not so topical that a slight increase in the time between production and exhibition is impractical . It may well be that the networks wish to avoid giving the affiliates the right to previewprogram episodes , fearing that this might lead to additionalpreemptions . Everett C. Parker , director of the Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ , writing in the New York Times on September 25 , 1977 , pointed out that under the law " the individual station licensee is still the trustee of the frequency it occupies , still responsible for everything that goes on the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never the intention of the Congress to have programming become the monopoly of three gigantic national corporations that can force their production local stations willy-nilly with economic annihilation as the alternative ; nor to have virtually all programs originate in Hollywood or New York with the talent of the rest of the nationexcluded ; nor to have prime-time programs aimed only at the limited audience of people between 18 and 49 , as the networksnow do , excluding the rest . Today the average **27;2023;TOOLONG station has no control over 65 percent of its programs . At best , it can only say yes or no to the network ; it has little influence on network decisions . "  |p67The  Networksand the Producers " You know and we know , as practical men , that the question of justice arises only between parties equal in strength , and that the strong do what they can , and the weak submit . " ? Thucydides , History of the Peloponnesian WarThere was a time when an independent creator could produceand sell television programs in a free and open market . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A producer could sell it to any one of dozens of nationaladvertisers for network exposure , or he could originate it in syndication by direct sale to stations or to regional or local sponsors . There were numerous sellers as well as many buyers , so bargaining was on an even keel . The parties would negotiate what both agreed was a fair price for the right to broadcast . The show would still be owned by its producer , and after its run was over , what he did with it by way of further use was his business . As we have seen , the syndication of new prime-time series gradually diminished , concurrent with the networks ' extension of their nightly coverage from 7:30 straight through to 11:00.  | The last year that there were as many as thirty first-run primetimesyndicated series was 1956 ; by 1957 there were twenty ; in 1959 there were fifteen ; ten in 1960 ; three in 1963 ; and the last one ( until Prime-Time Access ) died in 1965 . The producer who sold to national advertisers for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the network retained the right to approve material it disseminated , the advertiser would buy the program from a producer " subject to network approval . " This would have created no problems were it not for the fact that at that time the network also went into the program-production business and competed with the very producer who was seeking approval . It was not unusual for the network to find it was less likely to approve the offering of an outside producer rather than a program that it owned or in which it had a substantial interest . Loud were the howls of producers who found that after masteringthe Scylla of selling to a sponsor , they then faced the Charybdis of a sale to a network . Many production companies quit or concentrated on the relatively simple business of makingtheatrical movies . But a more resilient group adapted to the new climate . At first they made quiet deals with network spokesmen , often agreeing to cut the network in on any profits that might be forthcoming from foreign sales and postnetwork reruns . This practice was not called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a risk , or payment to the network in return for creative suggestions and advice . The networks ' next step was to remove the advertiser from the equation entirely and require the producer to deal directly with them , the logical progression from those furtive side-bar deals . At about the time network executives were trying to figure out how to announce and institute this move most discreetly , the 1959 quiz scandals broke . For months , " live ac/tion " shows , one on CBS called " The Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question " ( later supplemented by the " Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Challenge " ) , and one on NBC called " Twenty-One , " had dominated the Nielsen ratings . Unprecedentednumbers of viewers were transfixed by the spectacle of a contestant in an isolation booth , whose superhuman brain was apparently stuffed with miscellaneous esoterica and who invariably answered the most baffling questions just before the buzzer signaled his elimination . The bubble burst when several of the winners of $64,000 and $100,000 confessed that the shows were staged and scripted entertainments rather than legitimate tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were indignant speeches in both houses of Congress , and a highly publicized congressional investigation was undertaken . There were some who called this the networks ' darkest hour , but they underestimated the ingenuity of the great American communicator . CBS 's and NBC 's darkest hour became their finest hour . They turned defeat into victory , and at the same time solved that pressing problem of program control . Frank Stanton , president of CBS , was the spokesman . The network , he said , was just as angry as the American people , and for the same reason . It had been deceived . The quiz shows had been performed in their studios and broadcast over their air , but the network did not produce them . They were made by outsiders called independent producers and had been brought in by advertisers . The network had no control and did n't know what was going on , and if it had , it would have stopped it . He said CBS should have been more vigilant , and then in a stirring and clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for what appears on their schedules . From now on we will decide not only what is to appear , but how . " These shows had indeed been created and owned by outside firms , but they were broadcast from network studios on networkpremises , aided by the services of literally hundreds of network employees , many of whom were probably aware of what was going on . But it was more than a matter of liaison , especially in the case of CBS , for the " Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question " and the " Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Challenge " had been owned and controlled by a man named Lou Cowan , who sold his interest , and who before exposure of the quiz show scandals had become president of the CBS televisionnetwork . Stanton was as good as his word , and he apparently expressedthe feelings of all three networks . With few exceptions , from that time forward producers who had a prime-time series to sell would deal with a network . And though this sounds like three buyers , it meant , as we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have but a single customer . Producers were n't happy with the new arrangement , but most of them had learned to keep their complaints to themselves . Not so , however , David Susskind , who , speaking as head of his company , Talent Associates , testified before the FCC 's Network Study Committee in June 1961 . Susskind said that CBS told him that a show he brought to the network would have to be a CBS production . COUNSEL : It would have to be a CBS production ? SUSSKIND : Yes , sir . COUNSEL : I see . Well , now , did they give you any reason why it had to be a CBS production ? p 71SUSSKIND : They gave me a pretty good reason ; they said : Take it or leave it . COUNSEL : I see . Well , is this a new departure for you , sir ? SUSSKIND : Very new . You see , with the network , with the three network control of programming there are lots of new departures . It used to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty advertising agencies , any one of a hundred or a thousand advertisersor sponsors . Today you must sell to the network or you do n't get on the air . COUNSEL : Well , do you understand this to be a rule or policy of the networks now ? SUSSKIND : Well , I find it to be a rule where my own recent experience has been involved . COUNSEL : I see . SUSSKIND : That if I ca n't sell it to the network I ca n't get it on the air . Finally , Mr. Susskind mentioned " three men " who , he said , " have a death grip on programming " in the television industry . COUNSEL : What three men are you talldng about , Mr. Suss-kind ? SUSSKIND : The heads of NBC , CBS , and ABC . It was formerlypossible to sell a program to J. Walter Thompson on behalfof its clients , to McCann-Erickson on behalf of its clients , to B.B.D. &O.; on behalf of its clients . The area of suggestion , the area of exciting sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must sell three men , because the networks control it with a viselike grip . If these three men and their minions reject your program conceptions , you simply do n't get on the air . The fact that you could sell it to an advertiser or his agency is academic . This control , this vise , was born of the payola and quiz scandals , the answer to which was : " Well , we 'll take over con/trol , " said the networks , " so that this sort of thing ca n't happen again . " The producer of a " special " may still go to an advertiser , for that is the one area where the old-fashioned concept of sponsorshipremains . Even then the producer will probably wind up dealing with whatever network finds time in its schedule for the show . For all the rest of prime-lime production ? whether it be series , or movies made for television , or variety shows ? the producer talks only to the network . The problem the producer faces in dealing with a network is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost him to make his show , and he generally gets pushed , pulled , hauled , and shoved at every turn of what is politely referred to as the bargaining process . Except in rare cases where he may be furnishing unusuallydesirable star talent , the producer has no power . But the star system is no longer a major factor in TV , especially since the networks have adopted the policy of signing star performersto contracts that require them to appear exclusively on that network . The networks may assign the star to the producerrather than the reverse . It is true that the producer may develop a series that becomes , or gives promise of becoming , very attractive to the network , but long before he reaches that point he will have been bound to a meager budget for many years . The network is too smart to place itself in a position of vulnerability that would tip the balance in the direction of bargainingequality . Here is a typical example . A production company head learns from his vice-president assigned to find out such things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour action-adventure series for a year from next fall . He gets another of his vice-presidents to buy an option on ap73new book that sounds like what the network might want , the option being the right for a period of six months to offer the book as the basis for a TV series . ( He makes a more elaborate deal with the author ; it includes the right to make a pilot film and also a series , with complex provisions for fees and royalties in the event of success . ) The producer takes the book to the network , where a program officer reads it and , let 's say , likes it enough to risk five thousand dollars to " develop " it . At this stage development means that the network merely wants a competent television writer to prepare an outline of how he thinks the characters could be expanded and used in a series , plus a plot line for the pilot film , and perhaps some one-line ideas for future episodes . The producer says that the writer the network wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The network man tells the producer to make up the difference himself . They argue about it a bit , and finally agree to go ahead . " Have your business-affairs guys get in touch with mine , " says the network man , and the meeting breaks up . At this juncture , we should make two vital points . The first is that although the producer might have gone to any one of the three networks , he is bound now to just one . In theory he might approach one or both of the other chains if his first contactdiscards the project somewhere along the path of its development , but as a practical matter that seldom happens . Networks B and C assume that if the project is n't good enough for Network A , it is not good enough for them ; it is " damaged goods " and they have plenty of their own fish to fry . The second important point is that although the network has committed only five thousand dollars , nothing will be done , not even the five thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract that in minute detail covers every possible contingency of his relationship with the network on this prop74ject over the next nine or ten years . Such contingencies include the cost of a pilot based on a still-unwritten outline , the cost of episodes of a series that could not go into production for at least another year , and the cost of episodes that might be made anywhere from two to six years in the future . All of the time and effort going into such negotiations may be wasted . If the network does n't like the outline , the entire project can be aborted at the end of a few weeks . If so , it 's unlikely that the five thousand dollars will be missed . But the network wo n't take that chance . If they were enthusiasticabout the potential of the outline , they might order a full script . They could then make a pilot , which might lead to a successful series . The network can not afford to allow the producerto get into a position where at any stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless the network has him legally bound to irrevocable terms . In the earliest stages the producer has nothing that the network cares very much about , not even an outline , while the network has everything the producer must have ? the airwaves . Thus , with the five thousand dollars as the trigger , the **31;2052;TOOLONG discuss figures that might eventuallyexceed sixteen thousand times that amount . They first discuss the price of the pilot film in the event that one is made . The producer complains that he ca n't possibly make a picture for the price that is offered . The network representative , inuredto this plea , knows the pilot will cost more than the networksays . He also knows that the producer will not stint on expenditure because the producer 's primary interest is to make a pilot so attractive that the network will decide to order a series . The series is where he might make some money ; there is no way that he can get rich out of a mere pilot film . So thep75network negotiator says no , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of series episodes , assuming the pilot should turn out well enough to justify this final step , will be similar . Once again the producer will protest that the money offered can not pay his costs . The network representativerealizes that this is true , but he also knows that this is the producer 's customary risk . He is well aware of the fact that if the series should rate well and last for four or more years , the producer will be able to recoup his losses and , depending upon the degree of success and longevity of the series , make a substantialprofit . The producer , in turn , knows the long odds in this gamble : the chances of going to series may be one in ten and the chances of such a series staying on the air more than three years are another one in ten ; but what the hell , you ca n't make a hit if you do n't get up to bat , and you do n't get up to bat unless you play the network game . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatrical movies , and he has to pay sizable income taxes , he can write off his televisionlosses as a business expense and he can also get a tax advantage on any films he makes , an investment tax credit . So . the public will pay part of the bill . In the late seventies a vogue for miniseries and two-hour made-for-television movies introduced a type of programming that could not be standardized with respect to price and productiontechniques . Such shows might cost anywhere from $700,000 to $7,000,000 , making it impossible to negotiate a price until after a script had been written . To induce the networksto permit such a delay , the producers were required to " freeze " the property in the event that the parties could not agree on the program production price . The producer could not take the program to either of the other two networks for from one to two years after the script was finished . This reinforcementof the one-customer syndrome preserved the networkdomination of the bargaining process . Memoranda from network files , which were later subpoenaedby the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that network executives know that they are paying producers less than must be spent in the production of programs . Thus , the CBS vice-president in charge of program negotiation signed a memo , dated February 22 , 1967 , directing the network to " estimate what CTN 's ColumbiaTelevision Network 's costs would be if CTN had to pay full production costs on all series . " He wanted to " demonstrate the amount by which our program costs would escalate should we agree to pay the Majors such as Twentieth Century-Fox , MGM , etc. their full production costs instead of having them deficit finance series production . " In a memo to his immediate superior , dated July 16 , 1969 , an ABC programming executive pointed out that ABC exploited its buying power by imposing low prices on suppliers of ninety-minute movies for television by engendering a feeling of pride and competition among the suppliers as a substitute for economic incentive . There were bitter overtones in his complaint that Screen Gems ' top managementwas " intent on making a profit ... and has gone on record as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although the networks retain their capacity to produce programs , they use it very sparingly today in the prime-time area . It costs a network as much to produce a program as it does anyone else , and there is no reason why the networks should make programs at a price higher than what they pay an outside producer . As long as producers stand in line to get the opportunity to lose money , in the hope that they 'll hit the jackpot atp77the other end , there is no fiscal reason for the networks not to take advantage of it . Even the FCC has taken notice of what it calls " allegations that the unlimited network potential for producingtheir own entertainment programs can be used to obtain first-run programming at unreasonably low prices . " The producer and the network debate many more issues , always with the same result . They talk about the extent of time that various rights can be exercised , about how many repeats there can be in a year , about how many films will fill a minimumorder . But one extremely sensitive subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of the network 's options to renew the series for future years in the event that its first year proves successful . The network will ask for seven years of optionsand settle for no fewer than five . The network will offer an annual escalation in price of 3 percent . The producer will ask for 7 percent , and will settle for 5 percent . But the producerwill not even suggest that perhaps there should be no options , that if the show scores well in the ratings so that advertisers increase the amount they pay for spots without damaging their " cost per thousand , " it is his opportunity to profit and his right to ask for it . Options are assumed to be obligatoryin every deal ; this probably goes back to the days when networks sold shows , as distinct from time , to full or half-sponsorswho became the beneficiaries of a series ' rating success . A related problem is a network 's insistence that it alone , to the exclusion of its two rivals , must be the only outlet for any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series under negotiation , which are called spin-offs . ( " Rhoda " was a spin-off from the " Mary Tyler Moore Show " ; sometimes there are spin-offs of spin-offs ? " Maude " was a spin-off of " All in the Family " and " Good Times " was a spin-off of " Maude . " ) The problem for the producer , of course , is that even with a series successful enough to occasion a spin-off he is unable to obtain competitive bids and is bound to offer the spin-off to a single buyer . In view of inflation , the 5 percent annual escalation in price often can not cover increased costs . The effect of the low , price-fixed , long-term option is that if the show does not attract large enough audiences , it will not be renewed . The producer is left with heavy losses . If it is successful , it will be renewed , but at the standard , predetermined , below-cost fees . In the event of renewal , the series is worth dramatically more to the network ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pre-fixed fee to the producer , because the amount the network charges the advertiser for the value of an announcement reflectsthe show 's success . The high profits go to the network . This point was brought home in a complaint by Lee Rich , producer of " The Waltons , " the successful one hour series on CBS . On September 23 , 1974 , the trade magazine Broadcastingreported that " Mr. Rich said he understands CBS is charging$100,000 for one minute of advertising on The Waltonsaveraginga $600,000 intake for each one-hour program . Why , I do n't get even half that sum to produce the show , ' Mr. Rich complained . " Most producers , however , refrain from open criticism of their customers . When The Nation commissioned Anne Langman in 1956 to write a series of articles on the television industry , she had to report that " none of the independents I have talked with will allow me to quote them by name . Their position with the networks is already precarious and they fear that if they antagonize them further they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On February 1 , 1978 , this rule of public silence was brokenp 79by the senior vice-president for administration and production of Paramount Television , Art Frankel . Speaking in San Diego to the convention of the Association of Independent Television Stations , Frankel first pointedly disassociated his employer from what he was about to say . He then described the process of developing shows for networks as " akin to playing Russian roulette . " He added : " Network programming executives are quite human , despite the fact that some have the tendency to view themselves as God-like . " About the producer he said : " Caught between the upper pressure of steadily rising costs , especially in the guild and labor union areas , and the downwardpressure of all three networks to hold the line on license fees , the supplier is fortunate indeed if he can come close to breaking even on a show in the first year or two . All of the leverageis with the network since the supplier is contractually bound to continue to deliver the show at the previously agreeduponprice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business area , the network dominates the producer with respect to program content . During the course of that stately minuet known as contract negotation , the business-affairs contestants sometimes spar over who has what " creative controls . " This dispute is frequentlythe most fruitless argument of all , since the exercise of any such rights depends upon the economic realities of the moment and has nothing to do with whatever may be codified on a piece of paper . This is most obvious in the production of a pilot film or tape . If the representative of the network program department suggestsan addition , deletion , or change in some part of the story , a change in characterization , action , stage business , or even casting or direction , or perhaps shooting location or method ofp80scoring background music , the producer will go along . He may protest that the change will harm the story or cheapen the picture ; he may scream that the network representative is irresponsible , spending the producer 's money for him foolishly and wastefully . But he will go along , primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether this show will ever go to series , and the program representative will probably have something to say about that . His is n't the only pilot that is being made for this network ; there are probably five or six available for each open time-period that may exist one year from the shooting dates . After all , the whole point of this costly exercise is to get a series on the air ; there is no purpose in continuingwith a show that the network wo n't like . The same forces are in play to only a slightly lesser extent in the production of the series . The network can always decide not to renew a series , or simply cancel earlier on . Both parties recognize that the future of the show depends on its ability to attract a large , demographically " right " audience , which , becauseof the network 's elaborate research techniques , the produceris in no position to oppose . Only when his series has achieved the status of the rare smash hit can the producer asserthis creative independence . Until then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Rayburn , who said , " The way to get along is to go along . " You will remember that CBS 's Frank Stanton initiated this procedure in his righteously indignant declaration at the time of the quiz scandals : " From now on we will decide not only what is to appear , but how . " Less than four years later , his corporationwas able to assure its stockholders that they as viewerscould depend on the " continuing participation of the Network 's programming officials at every stage of the creative process from the initial script to the final broadcast . "  |p81NBC  and ABC have immodestly acknowledged similar control , and in the case of the latter , an internal memo disclosed an engaging frankness about one of the benefits of the policy . In 1965 , ABC was considering the production of a series entitled " Blue Light " through its wholly owned subsidiary , Selmur Productions , but after analyzing the risk of having to deficit finance the series , ABC contracted with Twentieth CenturyFoxto produce the show . The ABC memo stated : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing , we lose the ability to persuade ' the utmost in production values from the producer . " In view of such boasts , the networks have found it impossible to claim immunity from charges that they are responsible for the surfeit of violence on television . That the appearance of violence is the result of deliberate efforts to capture audiences on the part of the networks was attested to by several prominentwriters and producers who appeared before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce in August 1976 . David Rintels , president of the Writers Guild of America , West , said : " There is so much violence on television because the networks want it . " And producer Norman Lear echoed this statement : " The simple fact is that if the networks had not wished gratuitous violence on the airwaves they control , it would not have been there . " More than ten years before the Rintels and Lear statements , another congressional committee had heard a similar story . This committee was investigating the problems of juvenile delinquency . Eventually the investigation meandered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testifyabout a series that the committee found unusually violent . The network did not have a contractual relationship with the producer of the series , yet when the smoke had cleared awayp82one network executive was fired and another was on his way out . This investigation , which began in 1961 , was directed by the late Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut . Dodd had a long though not entirely distinguished career ; he left office in disgraceafter the disclosure of unethical financial campaign practices . Before leaving , Dodd had been one of the congressional masters of the art of headline hunting . As the doughty championof the comfortable , conforming , righteous folks who were the foundation of his constituency , he reveled in the role of curmudgeon , God 's angry man exposing and facing down the forces of evil . The hearings of the juvenile delinquency subcommittee proved disappointing to headline hunters . Apparently the subjecthad become dated . Then someone on the committee came up with the bright idea of investigating television as the cause of juvenile delinquency . The theory was that juveniles watch violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus become delinquents . Reporters paid attention . The committee darkened their chambers and watched action-adventure shows . The real problems of juvenile delinquency ( poverty , unemployment , socialinequity ) were all but forgotten , except in the assumption that what appeared on the television screen was connected to what happened on the street . During the height of the investigation the committee subpoenaedIvan Tors , the producer of a half-hour series called " Man and the Challenge . " Previous to " Man and the Challenge , " which had been well received by critics , Tors had been the producer , until he was fired , so he believed , at the network'sbehest , of a show called " Malibu Run , " which trafficked heavily in violence . Tors believed he was fired because he hadp83neglected to heat up the episodes . Tors talked briefly about the " Malibu Run " incident , and then volunteered the more interestingstory of the program he was currently working on . He explained that " Man and the Challenge , " which ran from 8:30 to 9:00 on NBC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of scientist , measured the limits of human physical ability and endurance under various perilous conditions . The hero wrestled with steers in rodeos , went to Mexico to fight bulls , and drove fast cars under hazardous conditions . This was one of the last prime-time series to be sold directly to an advertiser , depriving the network of an immediate contractual link to the producer . But the advertiser had to get his desired time slot from NBC , and the network let it be known that the series would not run if it ignored the pieties of the genre . The advertising-agency executive assigned to this account told Tors that NBC had liked the pilot but did n't consider it strong enough to beat the Saturday-night competition . The ad man made it clear that the series lacked " sav , " shorthand for " sex and violence . " Robert Kintner , president of NBC , was responsiblefor the shorthand . Overnight the " sav " order became known as the Kintner edict . Excited by these revelations , the Dodd committee subpoenaedthe files of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read into the record a number of internal memos attesting to further discussion of the Kintner edict between NBC executives and United Artists ' representatives , Dodd read a memo from United Artists ' creative head , one Richard Dorso , addressed to John L. Sinn , president of the company . The document casts light on some of the problems of the producer , but that is not why the wily senator read it . Dorso wrote that violence , given the hero 's athletic tendencies , was not a problem . Sex was more complicated . " Sex is a two way street , " he noted . The hero , Barton , " is the bright colored fly on the hook that will attract women . And physically he comes equipped for it . We should undress Barton as much as possible in every episode . He has a fine physique and those rippling muscles should be displayed at every opportunity ... . He has no time for women , they fight for it , some succeed in getting it , but mostly he 's off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . That 's for women . " As for men , Dorso continued , " It 's that old standby , girls . " NBC wanted a sexy young female who would be the hero 's inamoratain every episode . Dorso opposed this concept because she would have to be the scientist 's secretary or assistant , not the sort of role which would create a satisfactory relationship for future stories . The memo speculated on the results. ( 1 ) The secretary would be an anemic , adoring hero-boss one , with her staring at him with poodle eyes while she said : " You 've had a long day , Sigmond , you 're tired , you should rest , " or ( 2 ) a relationship where Barton , stripped to the waist , turns to somebody and says : " Do you know my assistant ? " At this time his " assistant " has been making a pass at him ( or him at her ) and the show goes out the window with a laugh line . Dorso preferred using a different girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of these girls will be beautiful bitches with one end in mind , the seduction of Barton .... Playing Nader George Nader , the actor who was to portray Barton tough and hard to get . . . against a violent physical action background with a seductive , beautiful girl each week , should get the result we all want .... It is consistentand correct with Barton 's character to have him try to resistall the warm , full blown , wealthy , determined girls whop85want him to spend the rest of his life on their yachts living in luxury and going soft eating bon-bons . But he likes what he 's doing better which will please the critics and the PTA and at the same time be sexier , be more violent , and have more conflict . ( He 's got his clothes off , he 's trying to put them back on and she wo n't let him ; conflict . ) Robert Kintner was a witness on the last day of the Dodd committee hearings . He denied ever ordering the inclusion of any " improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Challenge . " He said he merely thought the series needed " more dramatic action " and could use " more romantic interest , " language which , some people in the industry felt , did not speak to the issue . Only a few months before , the committee had heard testimony from Maurice Unger , a West Coast studio production head : " Our files contain letters from networks cautioningagainst excessive violence . But these letters are not alwaysconsistent with phone calls saying : ... needs more sex ? needs blacker antagonists so that we can kill them off in a big climax . ' One of the advantages of producing series for syndication is that the producer is usually free of outside influence over his creative function . Companies that are now making shows for the prime-time access period are rediscovering the joys of independence . When there are 60 to 150 different buyers it is clearly impossible for the buyer to usurp the producer 's function ; no single buyer is that important to the supplier . In the mid 1950s , when I was associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndication , I ran into an exception to this independence ; it was my only experience with " advertiser influence . " In those days it was not unp86common for a syndicator to sell to a large regional advertiser , or to a national advertiser who wanted to spot his message in twenty or thirty specific cities . I went to a southern city to auditionthe pilot film of a series that one of the large cigarette companies wanted to sponsor . The company 's advertising agency had recommended the show and it required only the formal approval of the tobacco company 's president to close a rather substantial deal . The audition was held in the corporation'sboard room , where after a pregnant delay , the president appeared , surrounded by junior executives . The lights went down , the pilot unfolded . It was n't a bad picture ; as I remember it was a pretty good private-eye half-hour adventure . But I saw only its weak spots . At length the " heavy " was clamped in irons , the hero took flippant leave of the temporary sex interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights went on . There was a long pause . At length the president spoke : " It 's good . I like it . There is just one thing wrong . " " What 's that ? " I asked . " Everybody in the picture is smoking short cigarettes . " ( The tobacco company had recently switched to the king-sized variety . ) We made the deal . The president did not insist , but in the ensuing episodes , the characters smoked long cigarettes.  |p87The  Networks andthe News " There is a news monopoly . This situation is bad enough in the industrial and other key resource areas , but it is even more dangerous when it overrides the intentions of the First Amendment , one of the structural bases on which the constitutional system of efficient government was based . " ? Jann S. Wenner , editor of Rolling StoneThe networks have never permitted outside production of television news . Even during the days when the advertisers owned and independent companies produced the entertainmentprograms , news was the exclusive domain of ABC , NBC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most profitable branches of each of the companies , it was treated during the first decade of television as a public-service operation that depended upon the profits from entertainment shows for its continued existence . News was lumped in the same category with the occasional informational documentaries , classical music concerts , and other " high culture " presentations as the justification for the networks ' swollen profitsin the rest of their schedule . During one of his appearances before congressional committees , Frank Stanton talked about the relation of " entertainp88ment " to " public service " programs . CBS had just presented a one-hour concert by the eminent pianist Vladimir Horowitz . When Stanton was asked by committee chairman Hale Boggs to explain what appeared to be his network 's gigantic profits , Stanton said that CBS could not run programs that were not lucrative without substantial profits from other categories . He added casually , using the indefinite article to stress his point , " For example , this extra return made it possible for us to bring you a Horowitz . " Chairman Boggs appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what is a horowitz ' ? " Unfortunately , Boggs knew even less about the functioning of the network monopoly and the television system than he did about concert pianists . If he had been better acquainted with the business he was investigating , he might have asked Stanton : " How many times a week do you bring us a Horowitz ? " There has always been a sharp separation between news and entertainment at CBS . The " CBS Television Network " has had no control over CBS News . In his book Due to CircumstancesBeyond Our Control , Fred Friendly tells of a conversation he had while he headed the news department with the fabled James Aubrey , who was then president of the television network . He quotes Aubrey as saying : " They say to me , Take your soiled little hands , get the ratings , and make as much money as you can ' ; they say to you , Take your lily-white hands , do your best , go the high road and bring us prestige . ' " Aubrey 's words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the five other presidents who preceded or succeededhim , or by any of the presidents of the other networks . "  |p89As  the networks became more prosperous , so did their news operations . By the early sixties the red ink had changed to black . It was while this transformation was taking place that the networks , through their news departments , decided to take over the entire area of documentary production . A once-thrivinggroup of producers who specialized in making informational , news , sports , and cultural documentary films for television are now out of business or dependent upon ordinary entertainment shows for their survival . This network policy first gained publicity in 1960 when documentaryproducer David L. Wolper made a one-hour film called " Race for Space . " Produced in cooperation with the Department of Defense and also using film supplied by the SovietUnion , the show dealt with the history of rocketry since 1900 , culminating in the rivalry between the Russians and the Americans for space conquest . Wolper sold the program to a sponsor , and together they tried to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network stated its position in a letter from Frank Stanton to Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island . Stanton said that the network must " retain full responsibility for news and public affairs programs , " and that such responsibilitycan " best be discharged through our practice of producingsuch programs and requiring that news and public affairs personnel be employees of , and hence accountable to , CBS News . " Wolper complained to the FCC 's network study committee : " If the networks would only open the window you would find that a lot of fresh air . . . would blow into the television scene and the public would get the advantage of the exposure to new and exciting programming . " The networks had stated a " good reason " for their position ,  | but was it the real reason ? In 1968 , historian and Far East authorityTheodore White wrote and narrated a ninety-minute special documentary on China for the Xerox Corporation . Xerox was unable to get any of the networks to put the programon the air , so it was distributed in syndication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when President Nixon announced his surprise trip to China , Xerox commissioned an updateof the program . New film footage was obtained and the script was rewritten and narrated by White , the entire project being subject to his control . At about the same time , White became an employee of CBS . Mindful of the Stanton emphasis on the importance of the CBS employment relationship in these situations , I advised the advertising agency for Xerox that this time they might be able to get a time slot on CBS . I was wrong . CBS refused ; they had not produced the show . Xerox had to go into syndication again , with disappointing ratingresults . Jacques Cousteau , inventor of the self-contained **29;2085;TOOLONG ( scuba ) and world-famous underwater researcher , produced , directed , and " acted " in thirty-six underseaexplorations , all of which appeared as specials on the ABC network over a nine-year period . The original contract for broadcast was made with ABC , which conceded that in so esoteric an enterprise Cousteau would not be subject to ABC 's control except as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well for five years . Then for unexplained but apparently organizational reasons , the remaining Cousteau programs were placed under the jurisdiction of ABC News . They were , after all , documentaries . True to form , the news department demanded a clause in the new Cousteau license agreement giving it complete and final control over the pro/gram content . Cousteau refused . The idea that some landlubberwould tell him how or what to produce was anathema . The ABC news heads stood fast on their " responsibility . " In an effortto resolve the impasse , Cousteau offered to defer to the network completely if he should ever in any of his adventures touch on a subject of a political nature , but ABC was adamant . The shows went on anyway , without a signed contract . The networks ' rigid enforcement of the rule against independentlyproduced news documentaries proved to be embarrassing to them in 1977 . Early that year , David Frost , the British journalist and broadcast personality , had contracted with Richard Nixon for a series of television interviews . It was to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign his office , and it promised not only to give him an opportunity to tell his side of the story of the events that led to his downfall , but to reveal " inside information " not hitherto made public . David Frost tried to sell the Nixon interviews to all three networks , but holding to their rule they turned him down . Later on , ABC explained further that it considered it wrong to pay a public figure for a news interview . Neither of the other two networks had that excuse ; CBS had recently paid former Nixon assistant H. R. Haldeman for an interview with Mike Wallace , whereas NBC candidly admitted it had offered a fee to Nixon ( reported in the New York Times as $400,000 ) only to be outbid by Frost . Frost was forced to distribute the five interview programs by syndication . He sold some commercial announcements to nationaladvertisers and allowed the stations to sell the rest locally . The first interview was telecast on May 4 , 1977 , over 155 stations , and , according to Nielsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . The **33;2116;TOOLONG would not accept the program , of course , so in New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago it ran on independentstations . But because of the news value of the event , the nation was treated on May 4 and May 5 , 1977 , to the spectacle of all three network newscasts devoting at least half their time to speculating about what would be said on the first interview program , and later to a review and editorial commentary of what had been said . In order to preserve the rerun value of the broadcasts for future use Frost refused to allow the networks to carry visual excerpts of the program , but ABC circumvented this restriction by videotaping a family watching the Nixon interview on their television set . ABC devotedtime to Barbara Walters 's confrontation with Frost ( the interviewer being interviewed ) about human-interest details of the taping session ( " Did Nixon cry ? " " There 's a thin line between a glisten and a tear . " ) One of the ironies of this incident is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its contents had been carefully embargoed , but enough had been let out so that the leaks became the lead story on all three television network newscasts earlier that same evening . The superficial " headline " techniques of these newscasts became " teasers " for watching the entire interview soon to come on a rival station ? or if on the same station , only because some other program preferred by the network had been preempted . The real problem posed by network control over the broadcastingof news , and anything that can be corralled into that category , is not avarice . It is the power , the potential to influencepeople 's minds and actions , that is most troublesome . It is a disturbing fact that today most Americans do not read news/papers . Sixty percent of all Americans depend solely on televisionfor their news . Early in this century it was popular to decry the power entrustedto William Randolph Hearst because he owned newspapersin ten or a dozen of our largest cities . Although there were competing papers in all those cities , it was nevertheless a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to deliver " news " to so many people . In some circles Hearst was blamed for the Spanish-American War . ( " Remember the Maine " was Hearst 's jingoistic slogan , and when a photographer whom he sent to Cuba to take pictures of the war of rebellion cabled that there was no war to photograph , Hearst is reported to have cabled back : " You furnish the pictures ; I 'll furnish the war . " ) Compared to the power of a network president today , Hearst 's was slight . The potential for manipulation and control of public opinion that now exists in the top offices of American networks is without question beyond any preexisting private power in our history . This fact was dramatized on November 13 , 1969 , when Vice-President Spiro Agnew spoke , not impartially , of a " little group of men who . . . wield a free hand in selecting , presenting , and interpreting the great issues in our nation . " He then asked : " Is it not fair and relevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , enclosed fraternity of privileged men elected by no one and enjoying a monopoly sanctioned and licensed by the government ? " While premier of France , Pierre Mendes-France once observed that " to govern is to choose . " Likewise , a network 's decisionabout how much time to devote to , say , a disarmament conference , represents a choice about the significance of that piece of news . As a matter of legality , it is not censorship to devote a thirty-minute news program to Pete Rose 's salary ,  |p94fighting  in Beirut , the murder of a fashion designer in New York , and the price of oil , all of which may be significant pieces of news , while choosing to mention only in passing that the Soviets and Americans have not been able to agree on a time schedule for limiting the production of nuclear warheads . The reporting of news in any medium is a matter of selection , although not , as some broadcasters will claim , a purely neutral matter in which the broadcaster serves as a kind of medium chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proportionately more stringent than the limitationsof space in a newspaper , the problem of selection is intensified . Newspapers often censor themselves without permanent damage to the body politic . Theoretically , there is no limit to the number of newspapers we can have ; there are no physical or mechanical impediments that keep someone from starting up a newspaper . ( I say " theoretically " because of the problem of raising the large amount of capital necessary for such a venture . ) But no Horatio Alger , no matter how resourceful , can create a television channel . Even newspaper self-censorship can be extremely dangerous . I live in a small town served by only one newspaper . As a suburban community , we are covered by metropolitan radio and television services that can not be expected to concentrate on local problems that affect less than one-half of 1 percent of their coverage area . A few years ago an extremely damaging political scandal failed to appear in the columns of the newspaper ; those of us who fought the issue were frustrated by this omission in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem by scraping together enough money to print our own mininewspaper and mailing it to every citizen in the community , which had the effect of forcing the daily paper top 95print the facts . But how does one " reply in kind " to a televisionnetwork ? The so-called Fairness Doctrine requires televisionstations to permit access to their channels by those who seek to reply to a controversial statement , but neither the FairnessDoctrine nor any other rule provides for a reply to silence . Let us suppose there is an item of legitimate news damaging to the three networks which they choose to ignore in their newscasts . Since it is " local " to but one city , the stations in all other cities do not have access to it for their news reports . This means that to at least 60 percent of the United States populationthat event never occurred . Such censorship by silence has already taken place . Under the current law , television stations are licensed by the FCC for a period of three years . During that time they are not threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel . Although , as we have noted , the commission is not in the habit of denying license renewals , the end of the three-year period always poses the danger that some outside group may persuade the commission that the licensee has not done a good job for the community and that they , the outsiders , could do better . At best it forces the station owner to run for reelection , as it were , and to pay heed to the demands of local public serviceonce every three years . Naturally , station owners would like to lengthen this period . That is why in 1973 the trade associationrepresenting the stations , the National Association of Broadcasters , hired an experienced lobbyist and set to work to get Congress to extend the license period to five years . The networks , owning fifteen of the most important stations in the country , were in the forefront of the lobbying assault and were supported by members of the Federal Communications Commission , anxious to reduce their workload . Although the proposal went through many legislative stages ,  | was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress , and was the subject of a considerable amount of discussionand controversy , the television newscasts maintained a strange and stony silence . In their book Power , Inc. , Morton Mintz and Jerry Cohen describe what happened : " Many ownersand managers comfortably insulate themselves from . . . the handling of news about one 's own enterprise that concerns the outside community . Repeatedly , for example , networks and broadcasters have ignored hearings on , objections to , and the course of legislation designed to immunize them from effective challenges to their licenses to use the public 's airwaves . " In other words , you had to read the newspapers to find out what was going on . If you read John O'Connor 's column in the New York Times on June 30 , 1974 , you would have learned this : " If all goes according to the plan of the National Associationof Broadcasters , chief lobbying arm for the broadcast industry , the script might make an interesting TV series called The Great American Ripoff Machine . ' It would be the programthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industryalmighty ? " Edward R. Murrow hosted the first " See It Now " telecast over the CBS network on November 18 , 1951 . In those days the broadcast was live . As both the Brooklyn Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge appeared on the screen simultaneously Murrow said : " For the first time in the history of man we are able to look at both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of this great country at the same time . . . . No journalistic age was ever given a weapon for truth with quite the scope of this fledgling television . " In television , news is not selected purely on the basis of importance . We are all familiar with the fact that much obviously trivial matter is crammed in simply because it is " visual . " Itp 97lends itself to the use of tape so that we have something more than a reporter talking to us across a desk . Items of news , like everything else in the medium , are picked because they appeal to the kind of audience that is so commercially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an address to news directors in 1977 , David Brinkley elucidated the difference between television news and ordinary news . Brinkley said , Ours is a mature and serious news medium and it is time we had our own standards of news judgment , instead of those handed down to us from the newspapers ... And if it is news in a newspaper , is it not also news on radio and television ? No , it is not , and for a basic reason we all know but tend to forget . ... In a newspaper you can skip around , read what is interesting to you , and ignore the rest . While on a news broadcast you have to take it as it comes , in order . A newspaper can print things most of its readers do n't give a damn about , because those who do n't give a damn about them can skip them and go on to something else . We ca n't . So , what does that mean ? In my opinion , it means we should not put a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least ten percent of the audience ? preferablymore , but at least ten percent . . . . I do not suggest more light or frivolous news , or more laughs . What I do suggest is that the news judgments the newspapers and wire services have developed over generations may be fine for them , but not for us . We should stop using their habits and practices , and develop our own . We should not bore the audience any more than necessary . Television possesses extraordinary powers to communicate . Not only can it reveal people and events ; in the process of re/vealing them it exposes its own methods and motives . In The View from Highway 1 , Michael Arlen points out that essential to this process is an exercise of priorities : " There has to be a willingness on the part of the communicator to communicate this particular story , to put his bets on this particular event , to choose to make this process clear . " The point is that the televisioncommunicator is guided by the entertainment quotient of his audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the news sufficiently interesting or entertaining they will switch to another channel . Fred Friendly puts it concisely : " Because television can make so much money doing its worst , it often can not afford to do its best . " Friendly resigned in anger from his post as chief of CBS News because the network had refused his request to do live morning broadcasts of the hearings of the Senate foreignrelations committee on continuation of the Vietnam War , choosing instead to do reruns of a ten-year-old program , " I Love Lucy . " CBS management said this was a simple business decision : " There are times when responsible business judgmentshave to determine how much coverage of the Vietnam War one network and its shareholders can fiscally afford . " Friendly replied that the running of the " Lucy " repeats was not a matter of deciding between two broadcasts , " but a choice between interrupting the morning run of the profit machine ? whose only admitted function was to purvey six oneminutecommercials every half-hour , all of which had been viewed hundreds of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of overriding national importance takingplace in a Senate hearing room at that very moment . " In 1978 , CBS again demonstrated its view of the importance of rating points . At nine o'clock of the evening of February 1 ,  |p99President  Carter delivered a " Fireside Chat " on the thenpendingPanama Canal treaties . ABC and NBC preempted their regular programming to bring the President 's message to their viewers . CBS , however , telecast a made-for-television movie entitled " See How She Runs , " and ran a tape of the President 's broadcast at 11:30 P.M. , during the less valuable late-night time period . It ought to be noted that some CBS affiliatesdid not follow their parent 's lead ; they broadcast the President 's message live and delayed " See How She Runs " until11:30 . Not only is the news the product of careful selection by the medium 's news organizations , but the personalities of the people who " front " ? the anchormen , commentators , celebrities ? are the result of the sort of selection process that goes into picking any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to find the " right " ( usually neutral ) personalities who confront us each evening . Extensive promotioncampaigns are then conducted , including ballyhooing storiesabout the salaries of Barbara Walters and other news " stars . " If Walters gets a million dollars , it is n't because she is a more discerning analyst than a rival who gets less . She is worth it at the box office , the Nielsen Television Index reports . News commentators are akin to actors who are given personalities , whether friendly , funny , gruff , sour , attractive , or sardonic . Way back in January 1961 Robert Sarnoff , then president of NBC , in an address to a group of automobile dealers likened television to the assembly-line production of motor cars , saying , " We redesign and retool constantly to reach as many customersas possible . " That is why one felt an attack of deja vu upon reading a 1976 speech by Jann S. Wenner to the Universityof Southern California School of Journalism , in which hep100said : " Any number of studies and surveys have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . We do n't have a freewheeling , competitive , diverse , unrestricted free press as was contemplated by the First Amendment , but a Government regulated monopoly . We have a Big Three in New York just as we have a Big Three in Detroit . And what has happened to news is no different from what has happened to cars ; we are offered products that are essentially similar , inefficient , and unresponsive to the public interest . " Wenner voiced the usual complaint against television , applyingit to newscasts that " encourage the simplistic , superficial sloganeering that conceals and distorts complexities of personality , policy and philosophy . " He concluded by saying that " three networks each seeking for the same audience , are not capable of providing the diversity of views and competition for ideas which fully and broadly report the subtleties of our societyand those who propose to govern it . " Mark R. Levy , a lecturer in sociology at the State University of New York at Albany , conducted intereviews with 240 adults during October and November 1975 in Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for local and network televisionnews programs . Levy , who had been a writer , editor , and producer with NBC News , found that two-thirds of the respondentssaid that newscasters ' jokes " make the news easier to take , " that three-fourths liked TV news because it is often " very funny , " while more than half said that watching TV makes them relax and 40 percent reported that the late news helped them fall alseep . Levy 's interviews showed that onethirdof the viewers chose their local news program because of the entertainment program that preceded or followed it ; the next most common reason was a preference for the anchorman ( 20 percent of the local-news audience and 40 percent of thep101network viewers ) ; less than one viewer in ten said that " news quality " was the prime reason for tuning in . That last figure raises the question of whether the reason that so few people look for television news quality is that they do n't want it or that they are not conditioned to find it . This is akin to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get on television , or whether they merely submit to whatever is offered at the time . Is it logical to claim that ratingsprove that people would not prefer something different if it were made available to them ? Although the networks ' power usually tames obstreperous politicians , there is always the possibility that television news . can never be truly " free , " within the meaning of our constitutionalguarantees , because the power to license television stationsrests with the federal government . Thus , when President Nixon unleashed Vice-President Agnew on the television medium , there was , despite all the umbrage taken at network headquarters , a visible reduction of aggressiveness in the reportingof unpleasant news . Agnew had criticized what he called " instant analysis " by network commentators immediately upon the conclusion of a presidential broadcast . William Paley , chairman of the board of CBS , ordered the television network to cease the practice at once . Also , for reasons they never bothered to explain , all three networks refused copies of the secret Pentagon papers that had been offered to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the period when Woodward and Bernstein were writing some of their most important Watergate revelations , between mid-September and Election Day in 1972 , NBC devoteda total of forty-one minutes and twenty-one seconds top102the break-in , while ABC took forty-two minutes and twenty-six seconds . CBS did more ; there was a Walter Cronkite special on the subject on October 7 , 1972 , in retaliation for which , as reported by David Halberstam in The Atlantic ( February 1976 ) , Nixon 's aide Charles Colson threatened Frank Stanton with " We 'll break your network . " Perhaps the most dramatic example of the television industry'ssensitivity to government reaction occurred while Lyndon Johnson was President . Johnson had had a speech prepared by his assistant , Joseph Califano , in which the term public airwaveshad appeared . President Johnson penciled in ' s after the word public , so that it now read " public 's airwaves . " The next day Califano was besieged by all the major broadcast lobbyists , who wanted to know whether this change signified some dangerousnew anti-industry policy in the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War into our living rooms , but there is reason to believe that what they brought was largely a fiction . What we saw was what Michael Arlen describes as " a parade of film clips of guns firing and of smoke rising and of refugees fleeing , " a collection of images that smacked of thoughtlessness . Over a period of ten long years , television failed to tell us the major story of our times , the truth behind the tragic venture into Southeast Asia and all that it might portend for our country . The fact that our involvementin Vietnam resulted in 56,000 of our own men beingkilled , 156,000 wounded , and cost $155 billion that might otherwise have been used to combat poverty in America and in other parts of a hungry world moved Arlen to add : " It is a matter not of providing more combat footage , or more snapshotsof human misery , or even more routine documentaries on corruption in Saigon , but , rather , of acknowledging the truep103scope and texture of the subject , and finding the talent . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . . . or as several linked , separate works , adding up to a coherent whole ; or , at least , one wherein the terrible magnitude of the subject might for once be meshed with the commitment of the faceless but powerful network authorities . " Arlen wonders what might have hap-penedif the networks had chosen to seriously acknowledge their role as journalists , as something more than transmitters of certified events , and had given their correspondents honest reportorial missions and had then stood behind them . After all , was LyndonJohnson 's hold on the warrior spirit of the nation so secure that he would finally have compelled a network not to report , say , the chaotic forced uprootings of Vietnamese that so disastrouslyoccurred from 1966 to 1969 ? Did the businessmen of the nation ... have such an irrational stake in our Indochina adventure that if NBC , CBS , and ABC had said : " Look , it is different from what the politicians and Generals say , from what you think or hope ; technology will not win this war ; more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they would have ceased to sponsor network programs ? After agreeing that television news alone would not have solved the problem of Vietnam , Arlen concludes : " I think it is evasive and disingenuous to suppose that , in its unwillingness over a space of ten years to assign a true information-gathering function to its news operations in Washington and Vietnam , American network news did much beyond contribute to the unreality , and thus the dysfunction , of American life . " The potential of the network monopoly to manipulate or simply not inform the American public is tremendous . Yet ,  | paradoxically , the networks are constrained to relative impotenceby fear ? fear of government action against the licenses of their owned-and-operated stations , and fear of a loss of audiencewith a resultant loss of revenue . As usual , it all boils down to the dollar . In a speech to broadcast news directors , Edward R. Murrow said that television news is a combination of show business , advertising , and news . " There is no suggestion here , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropies . But I can find nothing in the Bill of Rights or the Communications Act which says that they must increase their net profits each year , lest the Republic collapse . "  |p105Censorshi|p  : Public or Private ? " The impact of television and radio has grown at an astonishing rate , and broadcasting promises to become by far the most influential medium of communicationin our society . As its power continues to grow , preservation of Free Speech will hinge largely on zealously protecting broadcasting from censorship . " ? Judge David Bazelon , of the United States Court of Appeals , March 16 , 1977The networks ' monopolistic power would seem to make them a natural target for legal action . As we have seen , this is not so simple from a practical point of view . Over the past 150 years Americans have controlled natural monopolies such as gas , electricity , water , and the telephone by creating administrativeagencies that regulate the prices that are charged for service . Commercial television 's costs are paid by advertisers , and what they pay has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been attacked by the networks as efforts to control thought . The networkshave contested almost every criticism of their business practices on the grounds that it violates their constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.  | The conflict between program content and the right of free .. dom from censorship by the government is almost as old as commercial television itself . When the time for the first license ' renewals rolled around at the end of 1950 , the FCC announced that it had a right to " go into " the matter of " off-color jokes , plunging necklines , and crime dramas during children 's viewing hours . " The FCC , however , did not act upon its own sentiments . The first speech by a member of Congress on what was to prove a popular subject for congressional oratory was made in 1951 by Thomas J. Lane , a representative from easternMassachusetts . He quoted then-Archbishop Cushing of Boston , who , like himself , deplored " lewd images , " a reference , in part , to the rather modest cleavage of an actress named Faye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaints that a steady diet of intensified violence was being fed to young people from the television screen , and that this was a prime cause of the current wave of juvenile delinquency . Researchers sampled network prime-time shows and counted over one hundred weekly murders plus numerous knifings , bludgeonings , and assaults , the exact number of which depended upon the viewer 's definition of the terms . It was pointed out that the more ferocious and brutal of these scenes were repeated two and three times , both as " teasers " before the show and as " previews of next week . " The repetition revealedwhy the violence was pumped into the show in the first place . Testifying at a Senate investigation into juvenile delinquencyin 1961 , Dr. Wilbur Schramm said that television crime and brutality were a " trigger " for youthful offenders . " The amount of violence is just too dangerous to go on . " Fifp107teen years later , Congressman Timothy Wirth of Colorado demandeda new FCC investigation , and called " network programs , loaded with violence , crime and sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of study , the United States surgeon general 's scientific advisory committee published five volumes , concluding that " at least under some circumstances , exposure to television aggression can lead children to accept what they have seen as a partial guide for their own actions . ' And : " A significant position correlation has been found much more often than not between watching TV violence andaggressive behavior in adolescents " and there is no negative correlational evidence . " And : " More overt aggressive behavior follows exposure to violent content than to nonviolent content . " It has always seemed to me that the real evil is not that the viewer , whether child or adult , will imitate the action portrayedin a fictional drama , so much as that he is taught , day in and day out , hour by hour , that all problems are solved by violence , that every wrong can be righted and every ending made happy by a simple punch in the jaw or bullet in the belly . Professors of communication George Gerbner and Larry Gross point out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is fictional , we expect , and often de-mand , that dramatic narrative be true to life . The viewer is thus subjected to a stream of " facts , " which are presented as if they were absolute statements about human nature . After watching television long enough , even relatively sophisticated viewers may begin to believe that all people are either good or bad , stupid or brilliant , shiftless or dynamic ? in short , cops or robbers . In this " realistic " television world , one-fifth of all living be/ings are engaged in law enforcement . One-third of the people portrayed on the television screen come either from the ranks of official or semiofficial police authority , or from the ranks of criminals , outlaws , spies , and other enemies of the law . Violence , of course , plays a major role in such a world . If it is visible , flashy , dramatic , it not only can answer all questions but it can tie up all loose ends within the hour . In one of their studies , Gerbner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amount of newspaper reading they did , gender , economic status , and age . Each of these groups was divided in turn into two parts , heavy television viewers and light television viewers . In all cases and in all groups , the heavy television viewers gave answers incheatingthat they saw the real world as more dangerous and frightening than did the light television viewers . To such questions as " Can most people be trusted ? " and " During any given week what are your chances of being involved in some type of violence ? 1 in 10 or 1 in 100 ? " and " What proportion of the population is engaged in law enforcement ? " they found that college education and regular newspaper reading reduced the percentage of those who viewed the world as extremely dangerous and frightening , while heavy TV viewing boosted that percentage within both groups . Also , television appeared to condition the reaction of the generation that never knew life without it , the figures indicating that the " under 30 " respondentsshowed higher levels of " dangerous world responses " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theover 30 " respondents . According to Gerbner and Gross , " we may all live in a dangerous world , but young people ... , the less educated , women , and heavy viewers within all these groups sensed greater danger than light viewers in the samep109groups ... Since most TV action-adventure ' dramas occur in urban settings , the fear they inspire may contribute to the currentflight of the middle-class from our cities . The fear may also bring increased demands for police protection , and electionof law-and-order politicians . " In the summer of 1978 , Florida was the scene of the murder trial of Ronney Zamora , a fifteen-year-old boy who in the course of a robbery had shot and killed an elderly female neighbor . His defense was that at the moment he pulled the trigger , he was " legally insane , " that is , he did not know right from wrong , and that this insanity resulted from his addiction to watching his favorite show , " Kojak , " as well as other action dramas on television . According to the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States from Cuba at the age of five unable to speak English , and he had learned the English language by watching television for approximately eight hours a day every day for the next ten years . Zamora 's attorney argued that the boy had become " subliminally intoxicated " by the prolonged viewing of television programs , especiallyby those depicting explicit violence . He told the jury that over a ten-year period his client had seen approximately fifty thousand television murders and this constant exposure to the taking of human life by the heroes as well as the villains had given him a warped idea of human values and behavior . The lawyer concluded his summation with an attack on television as a medium . Television has changed when we eat and when we sleep and when we kill and when we do n't kill and how to kill , and the good guys can kill , and the bad guys can kill , and it all comes on the tube again next week , same time , same station .... Nowp110they 've invented a machine that in case there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a rape on another channel , you can hook up this machine and it records the channel you 're not watching . . . you do n't miss a thing .... It 's time we did something . That this argument was ineffective with the jurors was demonstrated not only by their quick " guilty " verdict , but by statements they made after the trial , which was itself televised , with one camera constantly in operation in the rear of the courtroom . After the verdict eight jurors were interviewed , and each said that he did n't believe that television had anything to do with the case . Some of the jurors said they liked television programs , their manner indicating a resentment of the defense attorney 's attack on the medium . One male juror was especially outspoken . " I endorse any and all television , " he said . " It 's police shows , it 's ? what it is doing is bringing the everyday violence that occurs out on the street into your homeL-and you 're getting more educated . " A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior court ruled that a network could not be held civilly liable for negligence for showing an artificial rape on television which was later imitated by a group of teenagers . The parents of the young girl who was the victim of the crime sued the network that had broadcast the show , on the grounds that its executives were negligent in scheduling a programdepicting this act during prime time , because they should have known young viewers might be tempted to imitate it . The court held that the network was protected by the First Amendment against such liability , unless the broadcast came within an exception that prohibits " deliberate incitement " to violence.  |p111Although  the ruling of Judge Dossee is a proper application of the constitutional guarantee of free speech to television ? any other decision would make it impossible for a broadcaster to depict any act that might conceivably have harmful consequencesfor anyone ? it is nevertheless also true that apologists for the industry cite the First Amendment as protection against every form of criticism they encounter . Fred Friendly . has written that " the broadcaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise to his bosom is asking to have his constitution two ways . " It seems apparent that the amendment was primarily intended to protect the reading public , rather than simply serve as a shield for the property rights of the speaker . " Congress shall make no law .. . abridging freedom of speech , or of the press , " says the clause , and broadcasters are quick to claim that they are part of the press and that the press is named " as an institution " for specificprotection . Nevertheless , it is difficult to take seriously the constitutional claims that are based on the insistence on what former FCC commissioner Nicholas Johnson called " profitable speech , not free speech . " The real censorship that the viewer faces comes not from the government , but from the industry itself . This problem was dramatized by some widely publicized events beginning in the fall of 1975 , by which time congressionalspeeches on television violence had become especially pointed . But continued demands that the industry " do somethingabout it " fell on deaf ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " action " shows , and the competitionseemed to focus on the amount and intensity of the actionrather than on the nature of the action itself . As congressional complaints increased , Richard Wiley , then chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , bep112came increasingly exercised . As he later testified , he did not have the inclination to become a censor , and he doubted whether the FCC as such had any authority to be one . After all , the Communications Act contains a specific prohibition against the FCC 's interfering in program content . Nevertheless , Wiley called a meeting of the presidents of each of the three national networks , and in what he apparently considered circumspect language suggested that they ought to take measures . Wiley was using what insiders at the FCC call the " raised eyebrow technique . " Later on , a federal judge was to reprove Wiley for " issuing threats of regulatory action " if no voluntary action was forthcoming . In any event , three days later Arthur Taylor , president of CBS , announced that commencing the following fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving sex or violence between 7:00 and 9:00 P.M. Obviously , with the high rating potential of shows containing elements of sex and certainly of those specializing in violence , it would be impossible for one network to follow such a policy alone , and the alacritywith which the other two networks agreed to adopt a similar plan suggests that a general agreement had been reached either at the Wiley conference or at some other time . The advent of what then came to be known as the " family hour " raised a number of interesting questions . In the first place it actually was an " hour , " because ever since the passage of the Prime-Time Access Rule the networks had not programmedanything other than news prior to 8:00 P.M. ( 7:00 P.M. Central Time ) . Secondly , because the Central zone has traditionallytaken network programming simultaneously with the East , prime time in the Midwest is from 6:00 to 10:00 P.M. , and the family hour ends at eight o'clock in that area . Based on the theory that children go to bed , or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Los Angeles , Philadelphia , and San Francisco , there is now an assumption that they go to bed and stop watching television in such cities as Chicago , Milwaukee , Memphis , Omaha , Minneapolis , Kansas City , St. Louis , and New Orleans at 8:00 P.M. ? no doubt one of those bits of demographic research that networks hold so dear . In the third place , nobody bothered to define what kind of programming or what elements of programming were prohibitedunder the rule . It soon became clear that sex was not the main issue . With increased sexual permissiveness in theatrical motion pictures and popular magazines , it appeared that nothingthat television dared do during any part of prime time would be of serious concern . Violence , however , is an entirely different story , but just what degree of violence was to be permittedhas never been decided and is the cause of occasional worry and internetwork backbiting . Finally , although the problem apparently had n't occurred to the networks when the original agreement was made , the family-houridea affected a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically the nonnetwork " station " time during the late-afternoon and early-fringe hours . Althoughthe rule specifies only the first two hours of prime time , it is obvious that if a show is not fit to be seen by children between8:00 and 9:00 P.M. , it is n't fit to be run by stations between4:30 and 6:00 P.M. , when the children have come home from school. i As we have noted , afternoon and fringe time has been a fertilefield for the reruns of off-network programming , including the violent action-adventure dramas that still grace the networksafter 9:00 P . : NJ The threat to future profits from the rerunsof the plethora of such successful crime shows as " Kojak , " " Mannix " " Hawaii Five-0 , " " The Rookies , " " Baretta " and " Starsky and Hutch " was real and they suffered an overnight loss running into millions of dollars . A TV Guide poll conducted between October 10 and 12 , 1975 , by the Opinion Research Corporation found that 82 percentof adult Americans favored the family hour . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a publicrelationsgimmick . The New York bureau chief of TV Guide said that " while Chairman Wiley called the concept a landmark ' and Senator Pastore said it was a wonderful idea , ' hardly anybody , privately , considered it anything but a gentleman'sagreement between Congress , the FCC , the networks , and the NAB to take the heat off all of them . " Most newspaper television critics viewed the family hour as an invitation to greater and bloodier violence from 9:00 to 11:00 P.M. Newsweek reported that the networks simply shifted their schedules , moving violent shows from the earlier to the later time periods Newsweek described the 9:00 to 11:00 P.M. segmentas " a cops and robbers ghetto " containing " no less than eighteen crime shows . " ) Hollywood writers and directors were outraged by the familyhour . They and their unions were joined by some producers who , feeling that the value of their property had been threatened , brought a lawsuit against the networks , the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters , and the FCC to bring an end to it . ( The National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had arranged to have its code-reviewboard monitor the compliance with the rule , thereby in effect giving it censorship powers . ) Action shows had been relegated to the post ? 9:00 P.M. period , but the programs that remainedon the schedule between 8:00 and 9:00 , largely situation comedies , were subject to more network interference in content and theme than was typical . Writers and directorsp115complained that certain adult topics had been prohibited , which in turn harmed the chances of success on the part of their product . Norman Lear , producer of " All in the Family , " had refused to agree to network demands for what he consideredsubstantive changes , so his show was moved from eight to nine o'clock . He assumed that this meant it would , by definition , lose its attraction as an off-network rerun in the afternoon period in the years to come . It was a peculiar lawsuit , based on the allegation that the FCC , through its chairman , had interfered in program content and in effect made itself a government censor . It was assumed that proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , even though the networks had agreed to put the rule into effect and would undoubtedly keep it alive with or without government censorship . Federal District Judge Warren J. Ferguson announced his decision on November 3 , 1976 . He found that Chairman Wiley , acting with the consent of the other members of the FCC , had threatened the networks with governmental action if they did not agree to curb sex and violence in their shows , and that this illegal action was an " indispensable cause " of the creation of the family hour . He also held that the National Associationof Broadcasters could not set itself up nor be empoweredby others to act as a television censor . But even with those findings the decision had no practical applicability . The judge could not order the networks or stations to run or not run any programs . The broadcasters have a right to exercise self-regulation , a remedy that the judge , as a matter of fact , endorsedas one answer to too much sex and violence in television , But Aelf-regulation is often a euphemism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement among the three networks.  |p116In  1964 , Associate Justice Byron R. White of the Supreme Court , referring to the protections of the First Amendment , said that " it is the right of the viewers and listeners , not the right of the broadcasters , which is paramount . " Justice White pointed out that although " broadcasting is clearly a medium affected by a First Amendment interest , " it is also a medium where there are more people who want to broadcast than there are channels , and thus it is foolish to claim that each one of them has a constitutional right to broadcast which is " comparableto the right of every individual to speak , write or publish . " Even though Chairman Wiley exceeded his authority in " suggesting " the institution of family hour , the FCC is not without power to enforce the requirements of such an hour as a condition for the licensing of television stations . The unpalatableand illegal aspect of censorship is what lawyers call prior restraint . The prohibition against censorship says , in effect , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does not say that you can not punish him afterward for having said it . The FCC has had the right to consider program content in the granting or withholding or renewingof broadcasting licenses ever since the formation of the early Radio Commission in 1927 . In the commission 's first case , in 1930 , it denied the renewal of radio-station broadcastingrights to a Dr. Brinkley , who used the airwaves to promote the use of goat glands as a way of guaranteeing sexual potency . In that case the United States court of appeals in the District of Columbia announced that the business of broadcasting is " impressed with a public interest " and because the number of available broadcasting frequencies is limited , the Commission is necessarily called upon to consider the character and quality of the service to be rendered . " And in another case two yearsp117later , the same court added , " This is neither censorship nor previous restraint . " Nor was it apparently " censorship " for the FCC to hold 1941 that no radio stations could editorialize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but set up as a corollary what is called the Fairness Doctrine , which requires a station " to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance . " ( This is not to be confused with the " Equal Time " rule that makes it mandatory for a broadcaster to give the opportunity for equal time on his air to all candidates for the same elective public office . It was the Fairness Doctrine that dictated , for example , that broadcasters had to make time available for messages presenting antismoking views , because stations were then running cigarette commercials . There is an important body of opinion that opposes the Fairness Doctrine on the grounds that it has a chilling effect on the presentation by stations of any controversial views , and is itself an **27;2151;TOOLONG on a broadcaster 's right of free speech. ) government censorship , for all of its evils , can at least be subjected to popular restraint . If what the censors are doing isbad enough to arouse public resentment , the voters can refuse f to reelect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry self-censorship there is no appeal , not even in theory . This distinction was brought to public attention by certain events occurring at the beginning of the 1977 ? 78 broadcast season . Reacting to the same stimuli that had brought about the family hour , a number of advertisers issued public statementssaying they were opposed to the glorification of extremelyviolent action as a means of getting high ratings . Simultaneously the networks disclosed their new programs for the coming season , which revealed a uniform turn toward shows preoccupied with sex ? or at least with what passes forp118sex on television . One such program was an ABC series called " Soap , " which some of the network executives predicted would certainly achieve high ratings because of a promised profusion of sexual high finks the like of which had never before been seen on the tube . An editorial in the New York Times described the series as one that " concerns the sexual predilections of members of two families , featuring a philanderinghusband and an impotent one , a transvestite son and a promiscuous daughter who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affair with her promiscuous mother . " The ABC announcement of " Soap " galvanized a wide array of ' church groups into counteraction . The United States Catholic Conference , the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention , the National Council of Churches , the United Church of Christ , the United Methodist Church , and the National Council of Catholic Bishops called for and supportedprotests , not only of the individual ABC stations that would carry the show , but of those business concerns that had reportedly bought advertising on the show . Within a few days a number of companies announced that they had canceled ordersfor commercial spots in " Soap " because of the threat of boycott of the advertised products . Once again the cry of " censorship " was heard , this time from executives of ABC , numerous advertising agencies , and the American Civil Liberties Union . This was censorship , they said , not by government or by industry , but by " private , irresponsiblegroups " who were preventing other Americans from seeing what they might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of " McCarthyite red-baiters " of the early 1950s , whose threats of boycott caused sponsors to blacklistradio and television actors , writers , and directors who were suspected of left-wing sympathies.  |p119The  opposition to the boycott threat was based on two unarticulatedassumptions . One was that a show can not go on the air without advertisers ; the other was that the existing method of program selection is by other than " private , irresponsible groups . " Thus , Frederick Pierce , president of ABC Television , said it is " a very unhealthy situation when special-interest groups ... determine what is right and what is n't for the viewingpublic . " What he did not say was that he and others in his ' position have been making that decision by themselves and they want to continue to do so ? and that they are a private " special interest group , " though their interest is based on an economic rather than a moral standard . There is little doubt that voluntary action by citizens is preferableto government censorship , and is , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ordinarily should be confined to individual protest , and that an attempt to prevent the communication of ideas or the right to receive them , no matter how unsavory they are , should be avoided . In other words , if we do n't like pornographic movies or magazines , we avoid them ; we do n't try to prevent others from viewing or reading them . The difficulty is that such a philosophy works only in a free market , like that of movies and the print media . The televisionset is in our home ; when we turn it on , we watch what we are given to watch : programming that the networks believe will bring them the highest possible profit . The church groups can argue that the " pressure " that they were accused of bringingto bear was at least democratic pressure , as opposed to the self-serving financial pressure continually exerted by their adversaries.  |p120The  Networks ' Invasion ofNeighboring Domains " The competitive advantage that defendants networks obtain in these relatedareas is not a result of their skill , foresight or industry . It flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of governmentally acquired licenses . The restraints effected are neither ancillaryto such licenses nor necessary for their enjoyment . " ? From a memorandum filed with the United States District Court for theCentral District of California by Department of Justice attorneys in UnitedStates of America v. CBS , Inc. , and United States of America v. AmericanBroadcasting Companies , Inc. , 1978One of the evils of unbridled monopoly power is that it enablesthe monopolist to bludgeon his way into areas related to ( but not necessary to ) the pursuit of his major business . It allowshim to use his leverage to compete unfairly and drive outof business legitimate practitioners in peripheral areas . Networkhistory is replete with examples of this type of gouging . The foremost domain of the networks is the broadcast business . Networks could be networks even if they did not ownany television stations . As far back as the days of radio , thep121networks exercised their leverage to obtain the ownership and operation of all of the affiliated stations in the nation 's largest markets . Today owned-and-operated television stations account for over $100 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well over $1 billion . When Senator Bricker of Ohio alleged in a speech in the Senate in 1956 that one network-owned television station had shown a profit of 1,834 percent on investment , and another 1,645 percent , CBS president Stanton rushed to the defense of his company . It was ridiculous to insinuate that the ownership of stations contributes to a monopoly environment , he said , because " CBS owns only 1 percent of the television stations in the United States . " Inasmuch as there were then 503 stations on the air , Stanton was arithmetically correct . What he failed to say was that at that time , CBS 's five stations reached not 1 percent but 25 percent of American television homes , and that given the fact that they had sole rights in their markets to the programming of 33.3 percent of the U. S. networks , the use of the horrid word monopoly in connection with them had justification . There is , of course , no technological reason for networks to own stations . Nor is there , as there once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearinghouses and time-sales agents for their affiliates , they depended on their **25;2180;TOOLONG for the bulk of their profit . Indeed , their broadcast activities were the economic foundation of their existenceas private entrepreneurial businesses . Otherwise they might have developed as cooperatives like the Mutual Network in radio . But since ABC , NBC , and CBS became the owners of programs and purveyors of announcements , and since they assumedthe role of suppliers to the affiliates , their income from the networking business has far surpassed even the massivep122sums gained each year by the owned-and-operated stations . Broadcasting is truly a supplementary business to networking . Another area invaded by the network was that of the talent agency . The agent , or " ten percenter , " as he is known , because of the commission he takes from the artist 's earnings , is a traditionalfigure in show-business circles . As the entertainment industrygrew more complex with the advent of radio , so did the agencies grow , some to the size of the giant William Morris Agency with hundreds of employees and offices throughout the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS and NBC that their huge power to hire and fire , to make and break actorsand writers and directors , afforded them tremendous leveragein persuading these people to join their own newly formed artists ' agencies . Overnight these two networks becamethreatening competitors to the existing companies . Any agent could promise to try to get his performer-client on a networkradio show , but only a network could guarantee it . Eventuallythe Department of Justice made antitrust gestures toward the networks , and at about the time television came on the scene , the networks agreed to get out of this business . It had been a minor venture for them , but it demonstrated the force of their leverage . The networks then went into the " station representative " business . All commercial television stations , network affiliates as well as independents , sell nonnetwork or " local " time to nationaladvertisers . This is called spot advertising , meaning that the announcements are " spotted " locally rather than covering the entire country by network . The affiliated stations sell this advertising in programs that are run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoons before the networks begin their nightly monopoly . They also sell time for spot announcementsmade during station breaks , on the hour and half-hour , p 123commonly known as " adjacencies " ( being adjacent to network programming ) , and they sell commercial announcements in localnews and sports shows . The major advertising agencies are centered in New York City , and it is important for stations to have a representative in New York who can readily do business with these houses . Thus the occupation of station representativegrew , with a single representative selling time on televisionstations in many cities of the country , though he handled only one outlet in the same city because of obvious conflict of interest . Since each of the three networks had four **27;2207;TOOLONG stations outside the city of New York , it was only natural for them to represent themselves insofar as those four were concerned . Once this machinery was set up , it occurred to them that there was no reason why they could n't represent other stations , especially their own affiliates . And it would certainly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it approached him for the **29;2236;TOOLONG . The result was that overnight the **27;2267;TOOLONG operated by the three networks becamedominant in the industry . The trade association of the dispossessed firms , the Station Representatives ' Association , approached both the Department of Justice and the FCC , allegingthat the networks had violated the antitrust laws by squeezing them out of their established business . After due consideration , the FCC agreed . The commission said that it recognized that the spot organizations could exert pressures on affiliates " because of the control exercised by their current organizationsover affiliation and network rates . " It added that the network spot-sales organizations " are in a position to extendthe influence of their networks over the affiliated stations " and the networks " could use their control over network affiliations to influence the stations ' choice of a spot representap194tive .... This influence could be exerted directly . . . it could also be indirect and involve no overt pressure by the network . Thus , stations may have an incentive to improve their chances of acquiring or retaining a network affiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation by network spot sales organizations . " Because the networks had " made use of a potent competitiveadvantage over independent national spot representatives in soliciting . . . stations affiliated with their respective networks " the commission prohibited the networks ' representation of any but their owned-and-operated stations . Therefore , by 1960 this particular instance of monopolization was over . But there was more to come . The networks had muscled their way into the **30;2296;TOOLONG by way of their monopoly power over their affiliated stations . Far more lucrative results were obtained by exercising their monopoly power over the program producers . Their exactions fall into three categories , none of which is part of or necessary to the operation of a network . They are syndicationrights , merchandising rights , and a percentage of net profits from nonnetwork uses . All three had become so pervasivethat the FCC , prodded by the Department of Justice , prohibitedtheir continuance as part of the Prime-Time Access Rule . Unfortunately , the effects of all three practices are still being felt , and will continue to be for many years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the distribution of filmed and taped television properties to both foreign countries and U. S. television stations as reruns . The distributor has a large overhead ; he has offices or representativesall over the world , and salesmen in many parts of the country . He must pay those salesmen either a **25;2328;TOOLONG or a high salary plus travel and living expenses . The business is highly specialized and the salesman is more than just a salesman ; he actually becomes a station programmer . In order to convince a buyer of the desirability of a particularshow , he must understand the competitive rating situation in the city and what kind relatively high , reaching 35 or 40 percent of the total amount received from all sales of the shows in the United States , and 40 to 50 percent of everything paid outside the country . The networks found an easy way to get into this business . They simply insisted to the producers from whom they purchased programming that the distribution rights be granted to them . This included not only the right to sell immediately in foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in the event of the show 's success . The networks ' re into resistance . Most of the programs came from producers who were also in the distribution business , particularly the socalledmajor motion-picture companies . Thus , Universal-MCA , Paramount , Columbia , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Warner Brothers , Twentieth Century-Fox , and United Artists all boasted large and successful distribution companies . As we have seen , they rely to a large extent upon the success of these distributioncompanies to justify the losing business of producing for network television . Nevertheless , even to these companies , and certainly to the large number of smaller and weaker independentproducers , the networks fell into the habit of insisting that if they were to buy a show , the distribution rights would be theirs . Sometimes when the network dealt with a major producerfor more than one series , there would be a compromise :  | the network would allow the producer to distribute every other series , keeping the alternates for itself . The networks had an easier time with those individual producerswho did not operate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still extremely valuable to that independent producer because he could literally sell it to one of the major distributing companies , which would give him a cash payment or a substantial guarantee in return for getting the rights . Thus , when Norman Lear made his deal with CBS for " All in the Family , " he had no choice but to give CBS the distribution rights if he wanted to get his show on the air . Some years later , after the series became a roaring success , Lear sued CBS ( and Viacom , its spin-off successor in the distributionbusiness ) to get his rights back . He lost the case ; the court felt he had gone along with CBS from the beginning and it was n't until the show became a hit that he decided that he had been coerced . This may have been true , but it still leaves the essential problem unsolved . Over a period of two decades the film-syndication subsidiariesof the three networks became the most powerful and successfulcompanies in the business . Galling though it was for a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metromedia Producers to relinquish distributionto their greatest rivals , they had no choice but to comply in order to get on network air . We have already quoted the producers ' adage to the effect that you have to get up to bat in order to make a hit . The network controls the " at bats , " and the producer must accept many an indignity in order to get his turn at the plate . The FCC 's purpose in promulgating the Prime-Time Access Rule in 1971 was to protect and encourage independent pro/duction as an alternative source of program supply . In addition to prohibiting the networks from programming a half-hour of prime time each night , the rule contained two other provisions . One prohibited a network from obtaining a percentage of profit or ownership in an independently produced program , a pervasive abuse that we shall discuss later in this chapter . The other provision forbade networks to continue to operate a syndicationbusiness ; it gave the networks one year in which to divest themselves of their syndication subsidiaries . Thus by mid-1972 , ABC had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of its former employees , while NBC 's went to a company called NTA and CBS 's to the newly formed organization of CBS stockholders known as Viacom . So extensive were the network distribution rights , especiallyon the part of ABC and CBS , that all three successor companies have remained important in the business , with Viacom the largest and most successful . A related area of activity that the networks wormed their way into is the business called character merchandising . This is the practice of licensing the rights to make T-shirts and other articles of clothing related to the chief character or characters in a successful television series ; it includes also the manufactureof toys and games , the publication of paperback books based on the stories that could be created out of the series , and coloring books , comic books , and even phonograph records and sheet music of the theme song . Obviously , this pursuit is not a necessary adjunct of the network business . Though some of the producers have their own merchandising subsidiaries , and numerous independent merchandisers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most formidable opera/tors as a result of the use of their leverage . In 1972 this business , being generally related to distribution , was spun off with the syndication operation . The other provision of the Prime-Time Access Rule was the prohibition of the exaction by networks of a percentage of net profits accruing to a producer from nonnetwork uses of a series , such as foreign sales , domestic syndication after the completionof network showings , merchandising , spin-offs into new series using characters from the old one ? anything that might develop from a successful TV series . This practice had been so pervasive that in many producer ? network negotiations the only discussion of it would be how high the percentage should be . Producers got to the point where they were happy if they could keep for themselves a share as large as that demanded and obtained by the network . The common contract method was to list percentages payable to a star actor , a director , and perhaps the author of the original book on which the series was based , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the 1960s there was hardly a prime-time show on the air that was exempt from this network tribute . An FCC report in 1970 set the figure at 98 percent . So widespread was the practice and so submissive were the producers that one network executivetold an investigating committee that the producers were asking the network to please take a share of the profits . The reason for such philanthropy was known as far back as twenty years ago when the report of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce noted that " the networks occupy such a key position , by virtue of their control over the best time in the key markets , that they have the power either to exclude independently produced programs from their sched/ules . . . or to give such programs access to network time only ' in return for the granting of an interest in the independent programs . " The excuse most often advanced by the networks for taking a profit share from later nonnetwork uses of a program was that the network was taking the risk of expending monies to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is little merit in this argument . In the first place , most production companieswere well able to fully finance their pilots ( the networks seldom paid the complete costs anyway ) , and in recent years , with most pilots being created as television movies ( or in the case of situation comedies , as part of " comedy specials " ) , developmentlosses were minimized . Furthermore , the demand for advertising time is so large and the supply so small that the networks have seldom been worried about selling a program ( or spot announcements in a program ) that they put on the air . In the entire history of American network television , there has never been an entertainment series that ran as a prime-time " sustainer " ? that is , without advertising . But there were many cases where a network took no financialrisk whatsover , yet extracted the profit participation from the producer . I have been connected with such cases , involvingall three networks . The first I can remember goes back to the days when sales were made directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its own expensethe pilot film of a series , " Tombstone Territory , " which remained on the air for three years . We sold the show for a firm fifty-two weeks to the Bristol-Myers Company through its advertising agency , Young &; Rubicam . Bristol-Myers had a " franchise " of a half-hour of weekly prime time on one of the networks . The program was purchased , according to custom/ary practice , subject to approval by the network . We were unhappybut not surprised when the network said it did not approvethe program ; it did n't like its content . A meeting was arranged between the president of the production company and the director of programming of the network , after which it was announced that the network had changed its mind ; it now approved the series ? and would receive 50 percent of all net profits from nonnetwork uses after the original run . Since the pilot had been made and the series presold , the network was taking no risk . A few years later , the same company produced , also at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona McClusky . " By this time it was understood that the written contract would have to be made with the network even if the producing firm succeeded in interesting an advertiser . Our company obtained the promise of full sponsorship from the Liggett &; Myers TobaccoCompany ( this was at a time when cigarettes were still advertised over the air ) , but the buyer informed us that we would have to deal directly with the network , with whom it had an arrangement for the allocation of a prime-time halfhour . Liggett &; Myers told us that they would let the network know that they wanted this show and would sponsor it . We then opened negotiations with the network , which insisted upon and got a percentage of our " future-uses " profit as part of the deal ? even though the pilot had been made and the series presold , so the network was taking no risk . In recent years , producers have sold television series only to networks , who in turn have sold commercial announcements in those series to advertisers . There is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor ( or cosponsor with other advertisers ) the entire showing of a single programp131called a " special , " usually a 60- or 90-minute variety extravaganzaor documentary feature . In this limited area the old systemstill prevails . The producer deals first with the advertiser and then goes through the sales process a second time with a network that might be willing to make an appropriate time periodavailable to the advertiser . Here again the network insists that the producer sign an agreement directly with it . In each case the network knows that there is no risk , and yet , in numerouscases before the practice was stopped , the network demandedand obtained a share in the profits that the producer might get from uses beyond that original network run . It is true that for the most part the nonnetwork uses were restricted to foreign sales because the high residual payments and the heavy selling costs make domestic syndication of single-shot specials unusual ( it costs just as much to sell one special as it does to sell a series of 150 episodes , with a dramatically lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-hour documentaryspecial called " Time of Man . " It was produced by anothercompany with which I was associated , in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural History , and bought by the network only after we had obtained assurance of sponsorship . About the time the network had concluded its two permittedprime-time runs of this show , our company was ready to syndicate twenty-four " National Geographic " hours . Becauseof the similarity of subject matter , we found that many stations would add " Time of Man " to their " Geographic " purchase , and we were able to make a large number of syndicationsales . The result was substantial profit checks sent to the network every three months , the share being equal to that of the producer . There were some network executives who believed that thep132business of participating in the profits of future uses of a series was related to the cost of production . But in the bargaining over what the network would pay the producer for his finished work , talk of profit sharing played no part . Both parties were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pay off on profit participation were remote , the odds being around ten to one against such a happy resolution . It would be folly for a network to depend upon the eventual receipt of a profit share to make up any part of the cost of a show . The absence of any connection between program pricing and the granting of a profit participation has been confirmed since the FCC prohibition of a network 's participation in profitsfrom future uses . The sums paid by networks for series have increased , more or less in keeping with inflation ? they certainlydid not go down when the practice was stopped . Since 1972 , who has been compensating the networks for their magnified " risks " ? As costs have increased , so have whateverrisks there are ? yet the networks have been making more money than at any other time in their history . Looking back , it becomes clear that all of the justifications were spurious . One is tempted to describe the practice as extortion , but that would imply an evil intention on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was consciously there . I suspect they rationalized their future-use participation because they realized that it was the network and only the networkthat could make it possible for the producer to earn any money at all . They could say with some truth that if they did not take the show there never would be any foreign sales or postnetwork runs from which lavish profits might flow . There can not be a postnetwork run unless there is first a network run.  |p133In  other words , they could say that they are entitled to a share of the profits that eventuate because they put the show on their air . The only trouble with that argument is that it is not their air . It belongs to the people.  |p134What  Can Be DoneWithin the System " Those who say they give the public what it wants begin by underestimating public taste and end by debauching it . " ? T. S. EliotTo condemn all television programming is stupid . But to fail to see that the bulk of it is shoddy is equally obtuse . And the effective disenfranchisement of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range fancied at the momentinvites correction . What should be done about it ? One answer is to give up on commercial television and look to alternative sources such as pay TV and public TV , the subject of the next chapter . Here , however , we will consider changes that can be made within the framework of our present commercial structure . The most desirable change is to arrange for a system that would allow for more networks and more stations , thus ending the monopoly and creating more diverse programming . Before Channel 13 in New York became a public televisionp135station , it was privately operated by a group of local people . The station management conceived the idea of producing a classical drama every week . The classics were used rather than more contemporary plays because they were in the public domain ; that is , because of copyright expiration there were no royalties or fees due to writers or their heirs . The programs were usually two hours long and ran twice a day six days a week , three times on Sundays . The production was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actors ' union allowinga low rerun fee for the fifteen weekly performances . Even though the plays were directed at a relatively small audience , and even with a low rating per showing , the aggregate of the telecasts made it commercially viable for advertisers . All fifteen performance ratings were put together to obtain an **30;2355;TOOLONG cost for a commercial . It was an example of how with enough stations one can , even under our commercial system , appeal to diverse tastes . It is comparable to what happens with respect to radio in our larger cities , where response to the large number of stations confirms the existence of a heterogeneous audience . One sure way to get enough television channels , all with relativelyequal technical potential , would be to abolish VHF transmission and have all television in the UHF band ? in other words , correct the mistake that was made when stations were first licensed some thirty years ago . There could be any number of networks , depending only upon the demands of the marketplace , and there could be as much diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government regulationwould be minimized , for we would have the advantage of truly free competition . At first there might even be more stationson the air than the economy could support , but so what ?  |p136Why  in the case of this one industry is it the public 's obligation to guarantee that there will always be a bonanza , that there will never be failure ? Of course it is n't likely to happen , mainly because there is no governmental body that could withstand the onslaught of the private powers that have vested interests in VHF . Oppositionto such a plan would be led by NBC , ABC , and CBS , whose owned-and-operated stations alone are worth over a billiondollars and whose vested interest in their networking monopoly ( which depends on VHF ) runs many times that amount . The networks would be joined by the great stationgroupowners , like Westinghouse , Capital Cities , Storer , and Corinthian ; by leading newspaper and magazine publishers like Post-Newsweek , Meredith , and Oklahoma Publishing ; and by major newspapers in such cities as Chicago , Detroit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of which own VHF stations . Even group owners of independent stations in the larger cities , like Metromedia and General Tire , would battlefor their tremendously valuable franchises . What I am sayingis that an attempt to take the one intelligent and simple step that could immediately solve all of our complex television problems would be met head-on by the largest aggregation of private capital ever assembled in this country , fighting to preserve the most massive total of paper values ever known to man . It is ironic that those interests are not really " vested " at all , since broadcasters do n't own the franchises , they are licensedto them . Could we not achieve a similar result through the plan called deintermixture , whereby allocations would be rearranged so that six or seven VHF stations would be clustered in a singlep137city , as they are in New York and Los Angeles today , with six or seven UHF outlets centered in other markets , presumably those that had lost their VHF stations to make the clusters possible ? Every city would be all-VHF or all-UHF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . The FCC toyed with this idea for a number of years and then abandoned it . They did arrange for eleven cities to be all-UHF , but , because there are only three networks and because these cities are relatively small , each one has only three UHF stations . The residents of those communities , however , get the same shows and get them just as clearly as do the viewers in other cities who watch VHF transmission . But this idea is vulnerable to the same attack as the all-UHF plan . It would not only kill the monopoly power of the three networks but would destroy the " vested " advantage now held by station owners who not only have no real competition but are secure in the knowledge that it is impossible for any to come in . In recent years the FCC has been looking into the feasibility of so-called " drop-ins , " new VHF stations of limited power that would not interfere with the signals of existing stations . But the technologically feasible drop-ins are so few and in such small markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or effort to the FCC . Just as the Federal Communications Commission could have solved the problem of diversity by making the country all UHF when it began its allocations , so could it have assured a multinetworksystem had it parceled out its franchises on a regionalbasis . Instead , the commission opted to follow its radiop138plan and provide for stations on a city-by-city pattern in order to encourage local self-expression . But let us suppose the plan had been to license all twelve VHF channels to a single large city that is the center of a region , with no two of those centers being so close as to cause signal interference . Each transmitter would then have sufficient power to carry the required distance . If necessary , the signal could be amplified by booster or satellite stations , such as those now in use in the Dakotas to carry programs from cities like Sioux Falls and Bismarck to the small towns of Aberdeen , Florence , Reliance , Minot , and Williston . Under such a scheme , there would be as many as twelve and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainingstations oriented to the region . The FCC 's original intention was to pursue the same localismpolicy for television as for radio . But television is n't radio . Not only are there many fewer stations , but the costs of producingtelevision programs are many times higher than radio costs . And all independent TV stations , even the most prosperousVHFs , depend on syndicated movies , talk shows , and rerunsof former network series for their basic programming . Aside from local news and sports exhibitions , there is little regularlocal television production beyond a few hours a week in the ten or twelve largest cities in the land . More important , the commission overlooked the fact that since most cities have only three television stations , there would be only network affiliates to watch , which meant that at least during prime time ( and , as it has turned out , during most of the rest of the day ) all the programs would be fed out of master control in Los Angeles or New York . As the networks have absorbed more and more of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere outlets for the networks . Instead of producing programs , they just turn a switch . The FCC has begun a new investigation of network activities , based on a petition by the Westinghouse stations questioningthe forced abdication of local responsibility by affiliates . The petition was supported by the Office of Communicationsof the United Church of Christ , which emphasized " the slow but steady increase of network programming over the past decade at the inevitable expense of locally oriented programs . " The FCC is not likely to abandon its localism doctrine in favor of a regional design , or any other structure . Such a move would not only meet the same political opposition as would an all-UHF proposal , but it would be fought by the leaders of every city not selected as a regional center . It is possible to improve television programming even withoutchanging existing channel allocations or opening television up to many networks . Though these reforms may be politically difficult or even impossible to attain , they are worth attention . One such idea was an outgrowth of the " 50-50 plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It stipulated that no network could own , either by production or purchase , more than 50 percent of its prime-time programming . This proposal was obviously a compromise of the conflicting views of committeemembers , and like many such adjustments it satisfied none of the businessmen who would have to live with it , and it died aborning . Let us suppose a 0:100 ratio instead of the 50-50 plan . This would mean the network could neither produce nor buy anyp140program ; it could only sell time . The network would be treated like a railroad , bus line , or telephone company in that it would be required by law to sell its product to all corners at previouslypublished rates ? in short , the network would be treated like a common carrier . The producer would pay the aggregate of the time charges of the affiliated stations , and this price would have nothing to do with the size or composition of the audience that the show might get . The producer would then sell sponsorship or announcements to advertisers . The reverse arrangement could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the network and then purchase the program from the producer . Such a plan would correct some of the economic imbalance inherent in the industry 's bargaining relationships , but it would not completely solve the problem of diversity in programming . There would probably still be the push for the largestaudience , of women eighteen to forty-nine , though there would also be some exceptions ( as there were in the days when advertisers controlled all shows ) . Also , with regulated and publishedtime rates , competition between networks and stations for dollars based on rating points would disappear . The flowof-audiencetheory would no longer apply , because with only three networks , the advertisers ' demand for time would continue to exceed the networks ' supply , and a network would not be harmed if it scheduled a relatively low-rating program or a program that appealed to older people . In any event , the networkcould not legally refuse to run an otherwise acceptable program simply because of an unsatisfactory rating potential . The common-carrier idea would n't do the whole job , but it would help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Willard Manning are not only partial to the " commoncarrier " idea , but have come up with two other ingenious plans . One is to have a different network control the facilities now used by ABC or NBC or CBS each day of the week . This would result in twenty-one networks , with the advantage that program selection would be made by what one presumes might be twenty-one different points of view . I doubt this method would be of much help . It would give a producer more customers , each with a proportionately smaller program requirement , but it would not remove the barriers to diversity , for we would still face the quest for the lowest common denominatorwith the desired demographics , and we would not be rid of the flow-of-audience bugaboo . Their other proposal is more attractive . Borrowing from the English model , where a single commercial licensee is granted rights in certain cities on certain days , they suggest giving one network access to the affiliates of all three existing chains for specified time periods . That might well be modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ABC , NBC , and CBS affiliates on one day each week , a total of seven networks , each of which would run on three tracks . This scheme would not cure the economic inequities , but it would strike a blow for program diversity . The network of the day would devote one of its sets of affiliatesrather than all three sets to attracting the largest mass audience . It would take pains not to fractionalize that major audience . Competing only with itself , it would program its other two chains of stations to pick up two other types of viewer , each group perhaps smaller in total than the first , but each embracing people in different categories of age , sex , education , interests , and the like . Instead of striving for a little betp142ter than one-third of the largest audience , the way CBS , NBC , and ABC do now , the new network would get all of that group plus two other audiences as yet untapped . Its economic selfinterestwould dictate that it try to attract the largest overall total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea , but might be attainable . Assuming ABC , CBS , and NBC would oppose any threat to their domains , the essence of the plan might be salvaged by turning it over to them . Thus ABC might be the single network on Mondays and Thursdays , CBS on Tuesdays and Fridays , and NBC on Wednesdays and Saturdays . All three networks could continue to program Sundays as they do now . There are simpler reforms that can be legislated by the FCC . First of all , the commission can amend the Prime-Time Access Rule to give it greater force and meaning . We have alreadysuggested in a previous chapter a basic change that might be made , including checkerboarding the access slots throughout prime time with different networks having differenttimes so syndicated programs can confront network programs . There is a common belief that syndicated shows can not successfullycompete with network fare because distribution takes so much of the producer 's dollar that there is not enough left to match the network 's expenditure on production . While it is true that the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake to believe that selling to a network is free . Companiesthat produce shows for network exhibition maintain scores of vice-presidents and lesser officers who devote themselves to constant meetings , travel , and entertainment , first to find out what a network wants , then to convince it that thep143producer has the desired property , next to keep the buyer satisfiedduring the process of production , and finally to persuade it to exercise options , such as picking up a pilot or renewing a series . Often there is a sales agent involved , who traditionally is paid in perpetuity 10 percent of all the gross monies receivedfrom the show ? a sum which in itself approaches the cost of syndicated distribution . The difference is that the networkproducer buries all this in his books as part of " productioncost . " The syndicator can take advantage of economies in productionthat are not open to the network producer . The syndicator is master of his own fate . He knows he 's going to make twentysixepisodes of his series and can amortize his fixed overall costs accordingly . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he is n't sure about those . As a result , he has to pay more than the syndicator for comparable actors , writers , and directors . The new popularity of what the critics call the " second season " does n't affect the syndicator , but it is devastating to the network producer . Today this concept has gone so far that by the end of the first week of December 1976 more than half the prime-time series introduced by the networks the previous September had been canceled . By the end of March 1977 some of the " second season " series were replaced by " third season " entries . The same pattern was followed during the ensuingyear . On October 2 , 1978 , a new record was established : on that day NBC announced the cancellation of a series that was exactly two weeks old . There are a number of reasons for this high mortality rate , first of which is the increased use of tape . The time lapse from script writing to the delivery of the print of a filmed episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in half when tape is used , so that a sudden cancellation results in destruction of much less unfinished material ? that is , there are fewer partially or completely finished episodes that will never see the light of day and must be classified as a dead loss . Secondly , the rating services have developed electronic reporting systems that reveal the ratings of any particular program twenty-four hours after broadcast rather than two weeks later as was formerly the case . This development has made it easier for the network hatchet-wielders to confirm that a show 's ratingsare consistently disastrous within a few weeks of its debut . But perhaps the most important reason for the quick disposal of a series is that the rise of ABC to first place in the ratings race ( prior to 1976 it had been consistently last ) has intensified competition : the financial risk in having a poorly rated show in the early part of prime time is so huge that no network can allowit to continue for long . Despite the heavy cost of quick turnovers and the forced substitution of expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally " buy " an audiencein self-defense . Now that they face the increased risk of early cancellation , many of the producers who traditionally sold programs only to networks have turned to syndication as an outlet for their wares . But even in syndication they must contract with one of the network owned-and-operated station groups in order to bring a series to life . The FCC could change this by prohibitingprime-time stripping by independent stations , thus forcing them into the market for one-per-week series , but this would penalize the underdog , who has a hard enough time competing with the network stations as it is . Another remedy would be to prohibit the networks from owning stations . Such a movep145would infuriate the networks probably more than any other proposal , but , as we have already noted , there is no more necessity for the networks to own stations than there was for them to be in the syndication business . A bill on file in the House of Representatives would prevent ownership by a networkof more than one station . It probably wo n't pass , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't . One other change should be made in the Prime-Time Access Rule , regarding the 1971 provision which prohibited the networksfrom exacting a net profit participation from producers . Vast sums of money are still being paid by producers to the networks for profit arrangements that were made before the rule was passed . If the profit snatching is wrong now , it was wrong in the past . The networks should be ordered to return their ill-gotten gains , or at least to stop their continued collectionunder old contracts . Aside from the access rule , the FCC could help to achieve more balanced programming by simply directing each network to schedule an hour or two during weekly prime time of unsponsored , or what in radio parlance was called sustaining , material . Because of the networks ' anxiety about flow of audience , such shows should probably be transmitted during the last hour of prime time . To avoid the creation of a ghetto , the three networks should schedule them on different nights . It would , of course , also be necessary to prohibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would be no preemption except for other noncommercialbroadcasts . In light of the swollen profits of the networks and the stations , there would be no financial problems . This idea is not a novel one . In 1946 , when radio reigned ,  |p148Alternative  Sources : Cable , Pay TV , and Public TV " The cable industry has been long on promise . You have called yourself a medium of choice , but you very often have only provided an echo . Even the new pay services which feature movies are an extended version of the networks ' night at the movies ? without commercials . Are these services so distinctivethat you can hope to expand your base of 1.6 million pay subscribers to reach millions more ? " ? FCC chairman Charles Ferris to the convention of the National Cable Television Organization in New Orleans , May 7 , 1978The strongest alternatives to commercial television are cable television and pay television . The two have recently been tied together for general consideration , although pay TV , unlike cable , can come over the airwaves . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer customers , on a subscriptionbasis , the promise of eventual channels that would carry new movies and other desirable entertainment free of advertising . Initially , cable television was called Community AntennaTelevision . TV signals travel in a straight line , and anythingp149that obstructs their passage , be it buildings in New York or mountains in Colorado , causes a reception problem . The first cable systems were started in small valley towns in Pennsylvania . TV signals passed untapped over these towns until the late 1940s when an enterprising citizen named Robert Tarlton put an antenna atop Panther Mountain and then ran a wire down to homes in nearby Lansford , carrying television signals from Philadelphia , just sixty-five miles away . Tarlton had created the first community antenna television system . Soon the Pennsylvania mountain country was dotted with small cable companies , many of them cooperative ventures of the residents of small towns . But it was n't long before business entrepreneurs learned that a five-dollar subscription fee for a month 's cable service could be a steady source of income . And a cable system required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task being to collect the bills . As long as the cable schemes were restricted to places unable to receive any other signals , the rest of the television industryignored them . Not until cable systems were established in towns that had a television station and threatened to dilute that station 's audience did broadcasters and producers express concern . Even then no serious alarm was sounded , because the early cable systems covered so few homes . I remember the day in 1955 when a salesman for the Ziv Company ( a leading film syndicator ) called his home office in New York to report that he was unable to sell " Cisco Kid " in Reno ( at that time a onestationtown ) because the manager said the series was being piped into Reno on a community antenna system , having been picked up from a San Francisco transmitter . He got some fast advice : Since the cable went into only two hundred homes and the television station at that time could reach twenty thousand homes , the salesman should go back to the station managerp150and offer to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . He did ; the manager saw the point , joined in the laugh , and bought the show . By the mid-1960s cable was no laughing matter to syndicatorsor to broadcasters . It was becoming a respectable business , claiming 2 million homes and 6 million viewers . Mayors and governing boards in some of America 's largest municipalities were being pressured by well-financed lobbies to permit the wiring of their cities . The cable owners ' associations , extrapolatingfrom recent years ' experience , predicted a growth rate that promised national saturation by the 1980s . Broadcasters rushed to their friends at the FCC , who obliged by freezing cable expansion in the top cities . They also prohibited cable from bringing in " distant signals , " programs piped into three-station markets from independent stations locatedin nonadjacent cities . The station owners complained that cable systems would dilute or " fractionalize " their audience , and that the cable operator was a competitor who had sneaked in by a shortcut and bore none of the costs and restrictionsthat beset broadcasters . But it was syndicators who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , were making it impossible for them to sell their programs in some cities and seriously depressingthe prices in others . The fundamental inequity was that the cable people simply took their shows off the air withoutpaying for them , while their competitors , the stations , had to buy their broadcast rights . This was piracy , said the syndicators , and they asked for relief under the copyright law . The association of cable owners replied that they were n't broadcasters , that they just put up an antenna , received a signal , amplifiedit , and sent it by wire to subscribers ? something akin to what happens when the owner of a large apartment house orp 151hotel puts a single antenna on the roof of his building and pipes the signals into individual rooms . The Supreme Court agreed with the cable view . A decade of disputes was finally settled on October 29 , 1976 , when President Ford signed the new copyright act , replacinga law that had resisted serious change since 1909 . Under the new statute , a small portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the copyrights of all programs carried on the wire . This amount is based on a complicatedformula that fixes as a minimum 6.75 tenths of 1 percentof the gross monies collected from cable subscribers , against varying percentages in the same range payable for each " distant signal " that the cable carries . Lower rates are prescribedfor small cable systems . Programs which run on a nationalnetwork or originate from a station located in the same city area as the cable system are not paid for ; presumably they could be picked up by the subscriber even without cable . The result is that the program producers and syndicators will probably get the lion 's share of a relatively small sum , with the remaindergoing to stations that originate their own material and to composers and publishers of copyrighted music that finds the same outlet . In the United States today there are about 13 million homes with cable TV , or about 35 million viewers . This comprises 4,000 systems serving 9,000 communities . The average system has 3,000 subscribers , but the sizes vary from the smallest with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 57,000 . The totalrevenues in 1977 added up to almost $1 billion , whereas the cost of laying the cable varied from a low of $4,000 per mile to $100,000 for underground construction in the largest cities . The fantastic growth pattern predicted ten years ago has not materialized , although once again the business is on an up/swing . The cable industry went through a depression beginningin 1973 , the combined result of that year 's dispirited economy , the sharply rising costs of cable construction , and a dramatic disappearance of demand . By 1975 the cable industry was once again prospering , mainly because of the addition of a new , attractive element ? pay television . Cable technology had already advanced to where it could provide multiple channels , twenty-eight usually being the number offered to new subscribers . Today one or two of those channels are sold as optionals . They can be obtainedby paying a monthly fee in addition to the regular subscriptioncost , and provide the viewer with access to recent motion-picture releases without commercial interruption . There are about a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two major companies being Home Box Office , a subsidiary of Time , Inc. , and Showtime , which is owned by Viacom . There have also been renewedexperiments with over-the-air pay television . A decoding device is connected to the homeowner 's TV set , enablinghim to unscramble a jumbled picture broadcast by a localUHF transmitter . This technique was first tested fifteen years ago in such disparate markets as Hartford , Connecticut , and Etobicoke , Ontario ( a Toronto suburb ) . Its failure at that time was due to a chicken-or-egg dilemma : subscribers would not pay for programs unless they were unusually attractive , and the suppliers could n't buy attractive shows unless the subscribersgave them the money to pay for them . It may well be that pay TV is the wave of the future . To its programmers men from ages seventy-five to one hundred will be just as desirable as women eighteen to forty-nine ? all they have to do is to cast their votes with a monthly check.  |p153The  drawback to pay television is simply that it will require the viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . Not only do we live in an economy of limited channels , we live in a world of limited talent , the best of which often goes where there is the most money . As the number of customers for pay TV increases , so does the amount of money available for the production of programs designed for pay television . These sums will be much larger than the amount now spent by advertisers , and pay-TV producers will eventually be able to outbid other television companies for the services of actors , writers , and directors now working in the free medium . Pay-TV subscribers will then get programs similar to those they now get without payment , and the future free television shows , having been made by inferior talent , will be worse than they are now . We must not fall into the trap of believing that " free television " really is n't free because it carries commercials that are paid for by the viewer . There is a theory that the advertiser must get more money for his product in order to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price which the consumer-viewermust pay for that product . But it is probably not true that the price of the product must go up because of the advertising . Even if it were , the TV viewer is not required to pay the cost . Suppose the viewer does n't buy the product , and suppose that somebody who never watches television does buy it ? the program is therefore free to the viewer , the cost being paid by his fellow citizen who ignores the tube . More to the point , there is little basis for the belief that advertisingincreases the price of the advertised product . If it did , advertised items would cost more than unadvertised items , people would buy the cheaper of the two , and the effect of adp154vertising would be contrary to its intent . The object of advertisingis to increase profits through greater volume , and to stimulateconsumption of the product in general and of the brand being advertised in particular . Failure to advertise will reduce the volume of sales so that the price of each unit must rise in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and presumablymore . In this respect , advertising is like rent : a merchant will spend tremendous sums to have his store at the prime corner of a central city where traffic is heavy , and he will even give up much of his expensive ground-floor space in order to have alluring show windows that will attract that trafficthrough his doors . Yet this does not mean he must get more dollars per unit for his product than the rival tradesman who sells from a third-floor walk-up loft in a rundown part of the city . My father was a merchant who sold fur coats from an attractivelyappointed shop located on the most expensive corner in town . He once explained to me that " it 's not rent per square foot that counts ; it 's rent per coat . " And so with television advertising . If the commercials go off the air ( as did cigarette ads a few years ago ) , the seller either puts his money into newspapers , magazines , billboards , and the equivalent of higher rent and attractive show windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least as much as he has saved . The result is that commercial television is just about as free monetarily to the viewer as anything he can get in our economy . The problem of whether legislators ought to encourage or discourage pay TV thus becomes a political one . Viewers who can afford the Home Box Office type of system will benefit from the advantages of more balanced and diversified programming , whereas those who are unable to pay the requiredp155additional fees will be relegated to cheaper and second-rate material . The FCC tried to help the networks and other broadcasters by prohibiting pay channels from running certain programs ? specifically , movies that were more than three and less than ten years old , any series programs , and sports events that had consistently appeared on commercial TV . The pay and cable interests sued to enjoin the continued operation of this rule , claiming that the FCC had not only exceeded its authority in dictating an entertainment format , but had violated their constitutionalrights . On March 25 , 1977 , the United States Court of Appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimanded the FCC for the many private meetings its members had had with representatives of the affected groups during the decisionmakingprocess . In response to the commission 's argument that it was merely trying to prevent the siphoning off into pay channels of the more attractive material that viewers had been getting free , the court replied that this form of protectionism was premature . It said that the FCC had failed to " put itself into a position to know whether the alleged siphoning phenomenonis a real or merely a fanciful threat to those not served by cable . " A myriad of new and wonderful technological developments are promised for the cable system of the future . They include two-way communication , direct academic testing and poll takingby means of pressing multiple-choice buttons , and an arrangementwhereby sixty channels can be sent into a home over the same cable used by the telephone company . The irony of this development is that with the great cost of using the oldp156fashioned technology of stringing wires as opposed to the more modern electronic devices , the full use of cable will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using all seventyUHF channels , or even the simple remedy of deintermixture . Another alternative to the networks ' monopoly is public television , which should be able to supply programming for some of the many groups ignored by commercial broadcasters . To some extent it does , as witness its broadcasts of opera , dance , " Sesame Street " for children , and " Over Easy " for people over fifty-five . The size of its audience , however , is disappointingly small , usually ranging from 2 or 3 to a top of 10 percent of commercial television 's . One reason for this is that commercial networks and stations promote their shows and advertise themselves to an extent that is impossible for public broadcasters . Another reason is the lack of good transmitting facilities ; only 85 of the 260 public broadcasting stations are in the VHF spectrum , and most of those are in small towns and college communities . More than two-thirds of the public television outlets are UHF stations , as compared with less than 15 percent of commercial stations . In the Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcastingstations , all of them UHF . An organization called the Committee to Eliminate the UHF Handicap on Public Televisionin Los Angeles has been formed to have the FCC allocate one of the seven commercial channels for public use , an endeavorthat is supported by the National Black Media Coalition . They argue that operating KCET , the major Los Angeles public station , is a " rather futile endeavor " and that the station " can not expect to reach the widest possible audience until it is transferred to a VHF frequency . " Their chances of acquiring ap 157VHF station are slim . A decade ago it was rumored that one of the four independent VHF stations in Los Angeles was for sale . The other six commercial broadcasters quickly pledged substantial financial contributions to the local public television people , hoping that they would buy the station and thus reducethe commercial competition , precisely what had happened in New York City several years before . But the commercial station was not put up for sale then and there is no indication of its happening soon . Perhaps the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the commercial stations is that the production of the programs simply is n't good enough to attract the audience that demands the professional pacing and polish of commercial programs but is dissatisfied with their subject matter . Public television does not have the tremendous sums of money needed to produce full-time programming of the technical excellence that American viewers have learned to expect . The problem of funding public broadcasting has always presented a dilemma for a democratic society : how do we preventthe government which finances a medium of communicationfrom using it for political purposes ? In the beginning , American public broadcasting , or " educational television " as it was then called , was financed almost entirely by the Ford Foundation , a private charitable organization . The decision on the part of the Ford Foundation to withdraw its support graduallyresulted in the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 . This legislation established a national apparatus headed by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which was designed to channel a modest amount of federal funds into the system . The Public Broadcasting Service was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public stations ,  | although each station retained its autonomy . PBS lacked both the power and the persuasiveness of a commercial network and the amount of money made available to it was far less than what advertisers pay to a commercial network for programming . To cope with the financial problem , the more enterprisingpublic television stations moved in two directions : they sought to obtain more money , and they sought to obtain cheaper programming . But the methods the public stations adopted to raise money opened them to the charge that they had become too commercial . First they sought out grants from large advertisers , who would use public television to improve their corporate image . Under this arrangement , the benefactor is not allowed a full commercial announcement in the show , but his philanthropy is acknowledged and his logo is displayed . Most important , he takes out newspaper and magazine advertisements and even publicizes his involvement in announcements on commercial television . All of this investment is made for the ostensible purpose of urging a large audience to tune in to a " culturally broadening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clearly self-serving motives . On the other hand , a low-rating competitor such as public broadcasting weakens the pressures commercial broadcasters might feel to run a lot of unprofitable public-service programming . Another method of raising funds is direct solicitation of viewers . Intermissions between acts of plays and operas are utilized for pleas to the viewers to send financial contributions . These pitches are not of the 30-second or 1-minute commercial variety but go on for 5 or 10 minutes at a time . WNET , the public broadcasting station in New York City , manages to collect over $5 million annually from approximately 300,000p159subscribers . But this is an expensive business ; the WNET operatingbudget is higher than that of any commercial station in the city , despite the fact that its locally produced programs add up to no more than fourteen hours each week . Although commercial stations hire advertising salesmen , they do not have to engage in the far more costly chore of fund raising . The business of raising money through grants and subscriptionshas affected the type of programming produced by the public stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve ethnic and economic minorities . New York 's WNET , for example , no longer produces a black or Hispanicseries . Instead , it specializes in programs like " Live from Lincoln Center , " and subscribes to series like " Masterpiece Theatre , " both of which appeal to the tastes of viewers in the economic bracket most likely to contribute money . At the same time , these viewers attract well-heeled underwriters who are anxious to convince the public that they are interested in cultural uplift as well as profit . Thus , a booklet distributed by WNET to corporations points out that " public television is cherished by underwriters because it includes America 's most influential citizens ? the active , the aware , the movers and shapersof society . " Michael Rice , former general manager of WGBH , the public broadcasting station in Boston , has said : " We are putting as much effort into selling our proposals as into creating them . Managers are known as much ? or more ? for their grantsmanshipas they are for the programs that come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is how to get betterprogramming for less money . For the time being , at least , the Public Broadcasting Service has found a partial solution in the purchase of successful British productions . It is unrealisticp160to expect public broadcasting to be able to afford the $10 millionprice tag usually placed on an American-made series of twenty-two one-hour programs . Such " Masterpiece Theatre , " series as " Upstairs Downstairs " and " Poldark , " and the British Broadcasting Corporation 's productions of Shakespeare , have given American public broadcasting viewers top-notch productionsat prices far lower than would be paid for the comparable American product , because whatever the cost , it has presumablybeen met in England and other parts of the world . Whatever is paid by PBS to the producers of these British programsis " gravy " ? and it is more than would otherwise have been obtainable from American television . This is because all of these productions had been or certainly would be turned down by our commercial networks because of their belief ( one that is supported by many years of experience ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch programsin which actors speak with a British accent . This emphasis on British programming has caused complaintsfrom citizens who have argued that the money of American taxpayers should be spent to encourage American talent , creativity , and production . Early in 1978 , Sanford Wolff , national executive secretary of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists , told the House Subcommittee on Communications that " the assignment of large blocks of prime time to foreign-made acquisitions militates against the encouragement of new independent producers and productionsin the United States . We are a large country , blessed with a multitude of creative people who need opportunities to grow and serve the public . Unfortunately , such opportunities are increasinglyclosed off to them abroad , as most of the Englishspeakingworld erects increasingly stringent barriers and quotasagainst American programs . We do not believe that publicp161broadcasting was created to make this situation worse . We do believe that it was created , at least in part , to encourage Americancreative talent in the media . With upwards of 23 percent of prime time usurped by foreign product , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman named Ellen Stern Harris of Los Angeles told the same committee , " Californiawas never a British Colony , but my children think it is . " David Ives of the WGBH ( Boston ) Educational Foundation responded to this criticism in a letter published in Newsweek September 25 , 1978 . After agreeing that there should be a U.S. version of " Masterpiece Theatre , " he said : " The problem , as always , is money . We are currently finishing location shooting of The Scarlet Letter , ' planned for airing on PBS next Spring . But it took us two and a half years to find the funds for it ? some $2,250,000 ? and even that is proving to be frighteningly tight . That amount is only a little less than the cost of an entire season of Masterpiece Theatre ' to Mobil . Public television wo n't have its domestic version no matter how good the idea , until we find much greater funds from some place . " The solution to the economic problem may be forthcoming in the " rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Subcommittee on Communications under the chairmanship of Congressman Lionel Van Deerlin . The key revision in this proposal , which was to go before Congress for initial consideration sometime in 1979 , requires commercialtelevision stations to pay a fee to the federal government for the right to use the airwaves , a portion of which would be diverted for the support of public broadcasting . There were differences of opinion among the members of the subcommitteeas to how much , if any , of this money is to be used for publictelevision , differences which pretty much follow party lines.  | And it is these differences ? whether , for instance , government funding of public television would turn it into an organ of political and cultural propaganda ? that must be resolved before any such proposal becomes law . The Van Deerlin rewrite would in effect charge commercial television with the duty of supporting public television by this indirect license-fee method . Should it not succeed , further considerationcould be given to the possibility of requiring commercialbroadcasters to take over the functions of public TV ? at their expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book suggested that one of the requisites of licensinga commercial broadcaster be the transmission of " sustaining " programs that would serve minority tastes and interests , it would appear that the money and effort currently expended on public TV might well be devoted to FCC enforcementof those standards . Not only prestige and pride , but the desire to keep viewers tuned to their stations might operate to create network competition for excellence of these programs . In other words , there might be superior public televisionon commercial TV stations for at least a few hours each week . P163The Roads to Relief : The FCC , Congress , and the Courts " The FCC for over thirty years has an all but unblemished record of misconceivingboth the problems and the available remedies in broadcasting . That they have done so with the best of intentions and ( except for a few sordid interludes ) with high standards of integrity , is a real source of scandal . " ? Professor Peter O. Steiner , University of Wisconsin Department of EconomicsTo what extent should corporate managers tailor their businesspractices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at the expense of their stockholders ? Should the management of an oil company , for example , refrainfrom drilling a potentially prosperous oil well in a recreationalbay area because of the danger of spills ? Or should ittake the position that ecological questions are matters of opinionabout national priorities , and who is the manager to placehis personal views above the claims of the stockholders whopay his salary and trust him to protect their economic interests ? Should a union leader tell his members that wage increasesat this time are inflationary , and that they should forgo demanding the pay raise that they elected him to get for them ? What would happen to him if he took such a position ? The resolutions of controversial issues , such as control of inflationand conservation of ecological resources , are indeed matters of public policy . Under an economic system based in theory on competitive free enterprise , we can not expect such anxieties to be given priority by private corporate management . They are , instead , the concern of all the people , , and the people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of more " government intereference in business , " chalk it up as another cost of industrial development . With most American industry , the battle between private and public interest is first settled in favor of private interest . The public must await the outcome of the slow process of legislation , the creation of effective administrative machinery , and the winning of court tests . But in the television industry there is theoretically no reason for these problems or delays . Television profits depend upon utilization of the public 's property , the airwaves , and all stations are subject to having their right to continue to use these channels examined every three years by an agency of the United States . Even though the FCC has never denied renewal of such a license because of complaintsabout a television station 's programming , and has shown little enthusiasm for performing many other regulatory functions , we should not eliminate it from consideration as a potential source of meaningful reform . Since 1953 , when the industry was seven years old , there have been continuous investigations by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special NetworkP165Study Committee and its successor study group , and an ongoingprobe by the antitrust division of the Department of Justice . These inquiries , many of which took place at the same time and overlapped each other , have concentrated on the anticompetitiveaspects of the network practices , on how they affectadvertisers in general and small businesses in particular , on what they do to program producers and to broadcasters , and the effect of network television on the public , with special emphasis on children and teen-agers . These extensive investigations brought forth no meaningful legislation until the Prime-Time Access Rule was enacted in 1971 . What is most significant is the fact that the changes finally made by the rule had been proposed at investigatory hearings seventeen years before the rule was promulgated , and some aspects of it were recommended by congressional committeereports as long as fifteen years before 1971 . Starting in 1955 , the FCC conducted one of the longest investigationsof the television industry on record . It appointed Roscoe L. Barrow , dean of the University of Cincinnati Law School , to " study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported within two years and went back to his university , but his chief counsel , Ashbrook Bryant , stayed on and continued the investigation as head of a newly created Officeof Network Study . Bryant , a great-grandson of William Cullen Bryant , displayed remarkable powers of endurance and tenacity . He continued the investigation for eight years , much of which time was spent in taking testimony from practically every man and woman connected with the industry . The " BryantReport " of 1965 became the basis for an FCC proposal that networks get out of the syndication business and stop exactingprofit participation from producers , recommendations that were finally enacted five years later . In addition , the reportrecommended that networks not be permitted either to produce or buy more than half the programs that they run in prime time . One may well wonder why the many investigations producedno other action than the mild prime-time-access reform . And why did it take fifteen years to accomplish that ? The two network practices prohibited by the access rule ( exaction of a profit share and of syndication rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of those investigations . Of course there were many spokesmen who gave excuses for those incursions , but in all the thousands of pages of testimony it is hard to find a witness who said that the industry could not flourish without them . The members of the FCC are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and serve for a seven-year term . The terms are staggered so that an appointmentis made every year . With three or four exceptions , they have been men . Most of them have been lawyers , although some have been appointed from executive positions in the communications industry . Some have been lame-duck congressmen , others counsel for congressmen , various investigativecommittees , and other administrative agencies . For the most part they have been an undistinguished group who have not been disposed to look kindly on any suggestion that would upset the status quo of a prosperous industry . There have been outstanding exceptions , but because there are seven members on the commission , these men and women have been known as dissenters when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary , the FCC is a regulatory agency made up of people who do n't want to regulate . Thus , Dean Burch , a recent chairman of the FCC , was an implacable opponent of the Prime-Time Access Rule , partly because , as he put it , he was opposed to regulation and preferred " free enterprise . " CommissionerRobert E. Lee began his term saying , " I do n't believe in government regulations . " George McConnaughy , an earlier chairman , said he believed in " as few controls as possible , " while John Doerfer , who followed him as chairman , told a congressional committee : " Competition does not frighten me . If the competitive principles of this country do not take care of that situation , then we are hopelessly sunk . " It was Doerfer who while testifying before the House Antitrust Subcommitteeexhibited a fine pronetwork bias . The committee counsel had just read the conclusion of a radio study which said that the network organizations were dominant " at every turn " in the radio industry . COUNSEL : Would that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same situation were shown in television broadcast-ing ? DOERFER : Not at all . COUNSEL : It would not disturb you ? DOERFER : Not at all . COUNSEL : Explain why not . DOERFER : Somebody has to be dominant . Somebody is big . The pity is that these men apparently never understood that the FCC was brought into existence to regulate , that there is no such thing as free enterprise in an unrestrained communicationsindustry , that laissez-faire is inadequate to resolve such abuses as those brought about by the network monopoly ? inP168short , that regulation does not destroy competition here , but must be enforced to make competition possible . Professor Bernard Schwartz was forced to resign as counsel to the House Oversight Committee after he had publicized , over the objections of some of the committee members , findingsthat were critical of the Federal Communications Commission . ( The controversial material had to do with certain commissioners charging the government for the expenses of convention and meeting trips that were also paid by various branches of the television industry , and also continual fraternizationwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including acceptance of various sorts of lavish entertainment . ) After he left the oversight committee , Schwartz published a book entitled The Professor and the Commissions , in which he wrote the following : " A prime characteristicof the regulatory commission in its ossified stage is that it is staffed by men who are basically out of sympathy with the regulatory objectives which the agency was created to accomplish . In none of the regulatory agencies has this been more apparent than in the FCC . " The members of the FCC are not oblivious to the criticism leveled at them for what appears to be a proindustry bias . In 1973 the late Congressman Torbert McDonald of Massachusetts , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Communications , blew up at a public hearing at which members of the commission were present . He said that he could n't understand the frenzy of broadcasters to obtain passage of the bill that would extend their license period from three to five years , when they have " a motherly FCC " taking care of them , and he referred to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill none of its promises , and still get a renewal . " HeP169concluded : " A guy has to try , to really want to lose his license . The dereliction has been discussed in open hearing among the commissioners themselves . Former commissioner Nicholas Johnson put himself on record : " The policy of the Commission is clear . The incumbent will win unless his behavior is so bad that we would be forced to take away the license even if there were no competing applications . " To which statement , ChairmanDean Burch , who seldom agreed with Johnson on anything , replied , " Yes , the industry has become a bit insular , a bit self-conscious .... " It is easy to say that the FCC , like other regulatory agencies , has become a captive of the business it was created to supervise . Owen , Beebe , and Manning take a somewhat different view . In their opinion " The FCC has been uncomfortable with the notion that its policies have economic implications and indeedwith the notion that broadcasting is a business . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcasters are public-spirited citizens , fiduciaries of the public , who are unfortunately obliged to sell advertising in order to defray expenses of operation . The responsibility of broadcastersis , officially , to the viewing public , and not to the shareholders . This unrealistic view is the source of ... much ineffective policy . " I find it hard to agree with their appraisal . Commissioners I have known are hard-headed men who understand the economicrealities , men who are too cynical to regard broadcasters as " public-spirited citizens . " I agree that they are " uncomfortable , " but I think that is because they are aware of their power and are afraid to use it . Nowhere is this more evident than in their handling of chalp170lenges to television station license renewals . Without preparationthese people have been catapulted into a position where they must constantly make decisions as to renewals and grants that can mean enormous gains or losses for their petitioners . And these decisions are based on an extremely vague guideline . Under the statute , grants are to be made on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " words subject to many interpretations . A prime example of how important and how difficult these interpretations can be occurred in late 1977 in connection with a renewal application filed by the Cowles Broadcasting Companyfor station WESH-TV , in Daytona Beach , Florida . The Cowles renewal was challenged by a local group on the grounds that Cowles owns a number of other stations ; there is a well-established FCC guideline to the effect that in any such case local ownership should be preferred . The challengers also pointed out that Cowles 's performance in Daytona Beach had been less than satisfactory . The commission was divided . All members agreed that the challenger was entitled to a " clear preference " because Cowles is a chain owner , but the majority ruled in favor of Cowles because , it said , it had demonstrated " superior " performance in the operation of the station and was thus entitled to " a plus of major significance . " The majority cited a 1970 decision of the U.S. court of appeals which said that broadcasters providing " superior " services are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vote was four to three . When the commissioners learned that the challenger was appealingtheir decision , they felt it would be helpful to Cowles if its favorable vote was not so close . The chairman , Richard Wiley , had voted with the dissenters because , he said , he couldP171not accept the word superior to describe the station 's past operations . He would go along with the word substantial . Accordingly , the FCC met again and issued a " clarification " of its previous decision . It now stated that it had used the word superior to describe service that was " solid and favorable " rather than " exceptional , " and it added : " We propose to use the word substantial ' to describe the kind of performance evidencedby the WESH-TV record . " The message to the industrywas that broadcasters need not provide " superior " service to protect themselves against competing applicants at renewal time , but merely " substantial " service , service that is " favorable and substantially above the level of mediocrity " that might " just minimally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the previous decision had stated that the challenger was entitled to a " clear preference " because of Cowles 's ownership of other stations , it had not been intended to suggest any view as to how much weight should be attached to the preference , and the preference emerged as " of little decisional significance . " As might have been expected after this semantic legerdemain , the Washington court overturned the WESH-TV decision . On September 25 , 1978 , a three-judge panel told the FCC that it had acted unreasonably when it renewed the Cowles application . The court , speaking through Judge RichardWilkey , criticized the FCC for finding favorably to the challenger on the issue of ownership diversification without " even vaguely describing how it aggregated its findings into the decisive balance . " It said that the decision process fell " somewhere on the distant side of arbitrary , " and concluded : " We do not see how performance that is merely average , whether solid ' or not , can warrant renewal or , in fact , be of especial relevance without some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfactory . " In another instance , renewal was denied to a television stationbecause of an unsatisfactory programming policy , but this was done over the objections of the FCC . As the result of complaintsfiled by a church group and a black citizens committee in 1966 , alleging that WLBT-TV in Jackson , Mississippi , had all but ignored Jackson 's substantial black community in its programming and practices , the commission granted the stationa renewal for only a short term . On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , Justice Warren Burger , who was later to become chief justice , first held that the church and black groups were in good standing before the court despite the fact that neither of them had any pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case . He then negated the shorttermrenewal and ordered a hearing before the FCC . The commissionobliged by holding a hearing and granting the station a full three-year renewal . When the matter again came before Burger in 1969 , he vacated the FCC action and invited new applications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those applicants . Burger predicated his decision on the statement that " the administrative conduct reflected in this record is beyond repair . " Although the WESH-TV and the WLBT-TV cases demonstrateto what lengths the commissioners will go to justify a licenserenewal , we must turn to a more flagrant case for a revelation of why the commissioners act as they do . We have already noted that the license of WPIX , New York , was challengedon the grounds that the station had falsified its news reports . In mid-June 1978 the FCC renewed this license by a four-to-three vote , the majority holding that the news distortionand inadequate supervision did not involve misdeeds ofP173sufficient importance to warrant denial . The minority said that the station was " guilty of a seriously deficient performance .. . which demonstrates either that the station 's top management during most of 1969 directly condoned the improper past news practices or that they did not want to uncover the facts about the misconduct . " The minority implicitly criticized the majorityby saying that WPIX 's license could be renewed only " by doing extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial service , ' " criticism which brought forth an angry reply . Commissioner James Quello , who had voted for the renewal , said he was " appalled " by a regulatory process that places " a long term , highly respected licensee in jeopardy through an opportunistic challenge that pits paper ' promises versus actual long-term performance . . . . I 'm especiallyconcerned with the basic unfairness of even considering the harsh ultimate penalty of license revocation ( which in this case would amount to a $75 million fine ) because of a derelictionwhose seriousness has been exaggerated out of context and proportion . This type of charge could n't possibly warrant even an indictment , let alone a conviction , in a civil or criminal proceeding . " In one revealing statement we see the mental process that explains why the FCC record in challenge cases is so consistent . A " long-term " licensee is , by definition , " highly respected " no matter what he has done or failed to do in the operation of his franchise , while any challenger is by definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to use the public 's property is the " harsh ultimate penalty " because it depriveshim of something worth $75 million . No matter that some years ago an earlier commission entrusted this property to him free . What is important to the FCC is the assumption that the licensee " owns " the franchise , and that he shouldn't lose it unless what he has done justifies " an indictment " or a " conviction . " The commissioners have n't interpreted " public interest , convenience , and necessity " as meaning " You 've done a good job for the public in running your station " ; they have assumed it means " You 've acted within the law and are not guilty of an offense so heinous that it would justify a fine of $75 million ! " The FCC 's passive and polite attitude toward the networks was epitomized in the summer of 1978 as a result of the socalled " winner-take-all " tennis matches . Approximately a year before , the CBS network had broadcast a series of matches betweentop tennis stars involving prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches as " winnertake-all , " explaining over the air and in print that the entire prize would go to the winner and the loser would get nothing . This was untrue ; in each case an arrangement had been made for division of the money . Thus , for example , in the Connors ? Nastasematch , it was prearranged that Connors would receive $500,000 and Nastase $150,000 , regardless of the outcome . As later testified to before the House subcommittee of the Judiciary and the FCC , certain CBS executives knew about this plan well before the promotional announcements were made . At first they claimed to have been unaware of the prepaymentarrangements but admitted that " a greater effort should have been made to elicit the correct facts from the promoter . " Later , before the subcommittee , Robert Wussler , CBS network president , admitted that he knew " early on " that the four matches in the CBS " Heavyweight Championship of Tennis " series had not been " winner-take-all " as advertised . He claimed that he did not sit down in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a gimmick .... how can weP175deceive the public ? " adding that it was simply " sloppy procedures . " He admitted letting the deception continue throughout the series even though he knew that in the second match both players would receive $150,000 in addition to the $250,000 which would go to the winner . The FCC also found that the CBS executives had misled the commission and hidden from it and public scrutiny , as requiredby law , the fact that CBS had received complimentary rooms , food , and beverages from a Las Vegas hotel in connection with one of the tennis matches . On April 9 , 1978 , Gene Jankowski , president of the CBS broadcast group , appeared on the CBS television network to apologize to the public for the tennis deception . He said it would n't happen again . Two weeks later he officially told the same thing to the FCC . Meanwhile , Wussler had been demotedto his previous position as chief of the CBS sports division , shortly after which he announced his " resignation " from CBS . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television station in Los Angeles , KNXT , was up for renewal . The FCC renewed its license , but for only one year rather than the usual three . While it may appear that this action is but a " slap on the wrist " and that the FCC is in effect saying that deceit of the public and of the United States government is not a sufficient offense to result in refusal to renew a license , it is nevertheless significant that for the first time in television history there has been a suggestion that the license of a **32;2387;TOOLONG is not sacrosanct . This may reflect the influenceof the new commissioners appointed by President Carter . It is noteworthy that the vote in the WPIX decision was four to three and the dissenters were Carter-appointed " rookies. "  |p176Since  this decision , President Carter has appointed Anne P. Jones , thereby creating a new majority on the commission , comprising members who have already shown that they are not averse to a departure from the traditional support of the status quo . The arrival of the new commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appeals in the WESH-TV case , may well presage a policy of honest and thoroughconsideration of license renewals . The new voices on the commission are being heard on other issues as well . In the fall of 1978 the FCC undertook a new investigation , examining network practices for the first time in twenty years . The last such investigation produced the Barrow Report in 1958 . The new inquiry is in response to the petition of the Westinghouse stations , and was announced by the FCC with the following : " Where some 50 percent of the programmingaired by affiliates came from the networks in 1960 , the amount is now two-thirds . And over the same period , network profits rose from $33.6 million to $208 million . " With a new majority on the FCC it is possible that the investigation may bring about serious regulation . The first demand for an investigation by Congress of the monopoly practices of the three networks was made in the Senate on May 13 , 1954 . Ohio senator John Bricker , who had run for Vice-President as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt-Truman ticket , proposed to investigate what he called the " dictatorial practices of the networks , " in connection with the introduction of a bill to require network regulation by the FCC . Bricker 's concern was occasioned by the fact that a group of prosperous central Ohio businessmen who were personalP177friends as well as constituents had recently raised and lost over a million dollars in a UHF venture in Dayton . Like many people who applied for UHF licenses in the early 1950s , they were under the impression that this was a good way to cash in on what they saw as a TV bonanza . Bricker 's cronies spent a great deal of money putting a UHF television station on the air and then found that they could not get network affiliation . The networkshad already arranged for their Dayton affiliations . The enterprise went broke , as did many another UHF venture . In a speech introducing his bill , Senator Bricker said that " the ability of an individual station to obtain network programmingtoo often determines whether that station lives or dies . " He pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for new television stations had been dropped , and that sixty of these were UHF allocations . He added that they had failed because " they were denied programs by the three networks . " The senator got his investigation , though his time in the limelight was brief . The following November the Democrats regained control of Congress , and Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington took over the chairmanship of the Commerce Committee , a body that has been examining network practices off and on ever since . But early in 1955 a report of Bricker 's investigation was published under the signature of Harry Plotkin , the brilliant communications lawyer who had been minoritycounsel and succeeded to the majority post . Plotkin regarded as unnecessary Bricker 's proposal that the FCC be given power to regulate networks . ( Although it is true that the commission has jurisdiction only over stations , it reaches the networks through the owned-and-operated licenseesand also by its right to order the affiliates to take action or to refrain from taking action during network time ) . His mostP178important recommendation was that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliated station could take from a network during specified times of each day . Plotkin restricted this proposal to affiliates in cities where there was no independent station , but as a practical matter this would have provided a most effective access rule even in the fifteen markets with independent stations , because no network could afford to program for so few outlets . The House of Representatives first got into the act with an investigation of network practices conducted by the Antitrust Subcommittee of its Committee on the Judiciary . Then there was a congressional Oversight Committee inquiry into how the FCC was coping with the pressures brought to bear on them by network and other broadcasting lobbyists . This was followed by Senator Dodd 's juvenile delinquency investigation , which led to attacks on television 's portrayal of violence . AnotherHouse committee examined the effect of the networks ' monopolization of prime time on small businessmen and recommendedreforms that would afford local advertisers access to their potential customers . As we have noted , various congressionalgroups investigated the rating services , the quiz scandals , and alleged bias in network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business with the networks , congressmen who were investigating the monopoly encountered more than a fair share of recalcitrantwitnesses . Some of the most recalcitrant were the operatorsof network-affiliated television stations . During one of the many hearings conducted by the Senate Commerce Committee'sSubcommittee on Communications , on a day set aside for executives of the affiliated stations , Chairman John Pastore , increasinglyannoyed at the parade of sycophantic apple-polishers , interrupted the proceedings to say , " I would like to makeP179an announcement now . If there is any broadcasting station in the United States of America that is dissatisfied by the way they are being treated by CBS , NBC , or ABC , please let them come forward . " None did . Nor have program producers been eager witnesses . Roscoe Barrow opened his network investigation in 1956 by asking for comments from the producers . Believing that there was both anonymity and safety in numbers , a group of five companies formed an organization known as the Association of Television Film Distributors for the purpose of preparing and filing a memorandum with the Barrow committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its authors considered the most flagrant network abuses . They proposed that the networks be divorced from program production , that time options be abolished , that networks be divorced from the syndication business and prohibited from demanding profit participations , and that they not be permitted to programall of prime time . The only one of the five member companies that is still in business is the Columbia Pictures television subsidiary , then known as Screen Gems . Although the memorandum was a joint effort , Screen Gems president Ralph Cohen had written the final draft and supplied much of the relevant information . It was natural , therefore , that he was the one to be called as a witness some months later by crusty old Representative EmanuelCeller , chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary , which was investigating the networks ' monopolistic practices . The Cohen testimony was an embarrassing fiasco . He backed away from the strong position he had taken in the Barrowmemorandum . Chairman Celler was moved to comment , " You were not so tender in your statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened to cause you to soften your attitude . " " Nothing has happened , " Cohen answered . The reply was , to put it charitably , inaccurate . During the period between the composition of the memorandum and the hearing , Screen Gems had sold a number of series to the various networks . That was the end of the Association of Television Film Distributors . From that time forward , the program producers who appeared before the various committees and boards of inquiry testified as though they were presidents of networks . During the protracted hearings of the FCC network study group , witnessafter witness testified that the producer yielded the profit participation voluntarily if not gleefully , that even where the network did not finance a pilot film they took some other sort of risk , and that there was a good and sufficient reason for every exaction to which they were subjected . Inasmuch as the FCC is an administrative arm of the Congress , representatives and senators have generally let the commissiondo the legislating . As we have seen , they are constantly advising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part they have restricted their activities to holding hearings and making speeches and " recommendations . " In March 1977 , however , Representative Lionel Van Deerlin of California , chairman of the House Communications Subcommitteeand a former television newscaster , announced that his committee would embark on an investigation that would lead to a drastic revision of the Communications Act of 1934 , the statute under which the television industry has functioned since it inception . Van Deerlin pointed out that the law antedatednot only television , but also " coaxial cable , satellites , directmicrowave beams , laser beams , fiber optics and a host ofP181other technologies which may change the lives of Americans as sweepingly as the Industrial Revolution . " He proposed that the law be rewritten " from basement to attic . " The suggestion of radical changes quite naturally upset the industry establishment . Technological progress and change in the art of communication over the last forty years did not make the existing law obsolete , according to industry spokesmen . On the contrary , they said , the Communications Act of 1934 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with continuing judicial and administrative interpretation it has been adapted to the changing times . CBS vice-president Bill Leonard said that under the 1934 act the American system of communications had become " the best on the face of the earth .... We produce entertainment in mind-boggling volumeand sometimes even of high quality . " He expressed concernthat " in some sort of mad race to abolish it or reform it , or whatever , we not fritter away those precious rights for which we have fought so hard for so long . " He of course added a reference to the First Amendment . In an official memo the NationalAssociation of Broadcasters asked : " Why is the public faced with any proposal or drastic restructuring of the broadcastingservice it enjoys and relies on ? " Despite the protests , the Van Deerlin committee went about its business . By the end of April 1977 , the committee 's staff had prepared 850 pages of background material which raised dozens of importantquestions , including , " If most viewers are satisfied with stations as conduits for national programming and if local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Should all television service be UHF ? " " Should networks be required to give up their owned-and-operated stations ? " and " Should competing applications be decided by a lottery or at an auction ? " P182On June 7 , 1978 , the Van Deerlin " rewrite , " as it was called , was unveiled . The finished product , which had been twenty months in the making and was 217 pages long , fell far short of the promised " basement to attic " revision . It did not suggest an all-UHF service , an end to localism , a ban on network ownershipof stations , or any of the other revolutionary reforms that its staff reports had indicated were under consideration . But there were some interesting provisions . First , as we have already noted , the new law would solve the problem of funding public television by requiring payment of an annual license fee by each commercial user of the television spectrum . Most of the money from this source would become the sole source of government support for a new entity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the money would go to pay the bills of the Communications Regulatory Commission ( the new name for an FCC with duties and budget cut back by 25 percent ) and to encourage minority ownership in broadcasting and the expansion of telecommunications services to rural areas . It was Van Deerlin 's guess that the license fee would bring in from $350 to 400 million per year . The " rewrite " contained other new provisions . It would reducethe number of television stations a single entity can own from seven to five , of which not more than three could be in the fifty largest markets . Also , in the future a single owner could not own both radio and television stations in the same city ( present owners would not be affected ) . Under the new proposal , the Fairness Doctrine would continue to the extent that when controversial topics were covered , there would be the requirement of a right to reply , but there would be no requirement that a licensee editorialize at all . The industry would have to continue to adhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to candidatesfor President , Vice-President , governor , or U.S. senator , or any other office requiring a statewide ballot . There would be no further federal regulation of cable TV ; such regulation would be left entirely to the states . Van Deerlin and his committee were disillusioned with the old process of license-renewal hearings based on the vague " public interest , convenience , and necessity " test , so they proposedthat new licenses and existing franchises that become available shall be allocated at random among qualified applicants . The licenses would be extended from three to five years , but ten years after passage of the new law , licenses would be granted in perpetuity , subject only to challenge on the basis of improper operation . This , of course , meant abolition of the " public interest , convenience , and necessity " standard . Nothingin the entire proposal raised such a storm of protest as the suggestion that there be no such test , whereupon Van Deerlin announced that he would reconsider the inclusion of the old standard in a redraft of the legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members published their suggestion of the annual fees to be paid by each station to make up the $400 million needed to support public television and for the other ancillary purposes . The staff proposed that in New York City each of the six VHF stations pay a fee of $7 million , whereas the UHF stationswere to pay only nominal amounts . The three New York independents protested , pointing out that $7 million for each of them was close to , if not more than , their annual profit ; the **26;2421;TOOLONG stations remained silent . The difference in profitability between affiliates and nonnetwork stationsis , of course , so elementary in any consideration of the television business that Van Deerlin was forced to order the staff back to the drawing board . He announced that his " rewrite " would be presented to the next Congress . As soon as Van Deerlin had folded his tent , Senator Ernst F. Hollings , chairman of the prototype committee in the Senate , announced that he would also undertake an investigation of the Communications Act of 1934 . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the law should be rewritten ; on the contrary , he saw the problem as one of minor cosmetic surgery . Some observers viewed the Hollings announcement as a political reaction to the House committee rewrite , perhaps stimulated by broadcasters who believe that the joy of automaticrenewal is outweighed by the pain of paying license fees . And while the form and substance of any congressional legislationis uncertain , continued debate and public discussion are assured . For the first time since the advent of television there is a concerted attempt in at least one house to cure some abuses and correct some inequities that have long been the subject of investigation and conversation . As we have pointed out , the basis for any legal action against monopoly and other destruction of what is known as " fair competition " is the antitrust laws ? a body of legislations that includes the Sherman law , passed in 1890 , the more comprehensiveClayton act , enacted 24 years later , and the various amendments that have accrued over the years . These laws prohibitprivate business from engaging in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix prices or limit production ? willnot concern us here . The laws that speak to the network situation include those violations covered in the broad concept of " restraining trade , " curtailing competition , and using unfair methods of competition . P185Most prominent among those who produce and distribute films for television are the seven major motion-picture companies ? Paramount , MGM , Twentieth Century-Fox , Warner Brothers , Universal , Columbia , and United Artists . These companieswere defendants in a long antitrust action brought by the Department of Justice , a suit which culminated just as televisionbegan to assume its place in the American living room . The Supreme Court decided the case ( United States v. ParamountPictures , Inc. ) in 1948 , declaring the defendants in violation of the antitrust laws because of their dual operations as picture producers and owners or controllers of large chains of theaters that exhibited the films they had made . Producer and exhibitor were , in effect , the same body , and this had resulted in the fixing of admission prices , block booking ( requiring an exhibitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the ones he did want ) , unfair discrimination against independent theater owners ? a vertical monopoly in restraint of trade . As a result of this decision , the motion-picture companies spent the next few years working out a " consent decree , " under which they had to divest themselves of ownership or control of theatersand of any direct connection with groups or pools of exhibitors ; in short , they had to separate the production and the exhibition businesses . When these same companies found themselves dealing with the networks in the television business , it appeared to them that there was one standard for picturemakers and another for networks . The networks not only controlled practically all of the exhibitors ? that is , the televisionstations ? they controlled the production as well . They furnishedthe shows in a manner similar to that which had been developed by the picture companies . The film men soon realized that network bargaining power dwarfed the **25;2449;TOOLONG must , because it is being laid under compulsion by a necessity immanent in the matter before it ' ( p. 458 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the necessary connections of logical thinking through an appeal to experience , in Mill 's sense of the word , is apparent from the examples of psychologism which Mill provides . His reduction of the axiom of contradiction to our experience that belief and disbelief are two entirely different mental states is refuted by the simple observation that people often do hold contradictory beliefs without any recognition of their doing so . Now this , on Mill 's theory that belief and disbelief are mutually exclusive mental states , would be impossible . If it is answered that the individual must recognize these incompatible states , so that he observes them to be contradictory , then we are now presupposing that which we have to explain , for why should the person grant to this recognition its privileged status ? Why should he feel compelled to recognize the contradiction ? Similarly , in his treatment of the axiom of the excluded middle , Mill misinterprets the nature of logical propositions , which are not abstractions from experience of actual things and events , but , as Husserl emphasizes , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Husserl 's analyses help us to see the limitations of Mill 's psychologismand the associationist theory of thinking in general , but it may be questioned whether they advance us nearer to an understanding of the relationship between the subject and the rules he uses , which , it was suggested , is the most basic question facing the psychology of thinking . On the contrary , it seems that the solution to this problem is even more difficult because of Husserl 's insistence that the logical be divorced from questions of empirical psychology . As Natorp ( reported by Farber , 1943 ) was quick to point out , the central problem for Husserl , and one which he never resolved , was that , having taken the side of the ideal or logical as against the real or psychological , there appeared to be no relationship between the two and the latter ? that which is psychological , empirical and real ? remained an incomprehensible , irrational residue . In short , Husserl 's solution to the problem was the Platonic one , namely , the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience and non-psychological in origin . Thus , whilst associationism is unable to distinguish rational from senseless thinking , Husserlian idealism seems quite unable to account for the transition from the senseless to the sensible . Mill and Husserl represent the two extremes , between which subsequent theories have steered their course . With what success we shall attempt to assess.  |p21THE  GESTALT THEORY OF THINKINGThe first major challenge to the associationist theory of thinking came with the formulation of Gestalt psychology . Associationism was based upon an atomistic theory of perception in which sensations were conceptualized as the building-blocks of complex mental processes . Gestalt theory rejected the atomistic bias of associationism in favour of the view that all psychological processes ? learning , perception , emotion , and thinking ? do not consist of independent elements , but are determined in the situation as a whole . Gestalt psychologists were led to this conclusion by their experiments on perceptual processes which revealed the inadequacies of the traditional perspective . For the Gestalt psychologist the distinction between a sensation and a percept is dissolved by the recognition that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A so-called sensation of brightness , for example , is never seen in itself and independent of things ; we never see a sensation of brightness but , rather , we see a bright object . As Kohler ( 1930 ) points out , the starting-point for Gestalt theory was the observation that sensory fields are replete with qualities and properties which one neglects if one takes sensations ' as their sole content . These properties can only be discovered if we analyse the perceptual field . This notion is stated clearly in Wertheimer 's ( 1923 ) monograph , in which he formulated the basic laws which govern our visual field , the laws of proximity , similarity , common-fate and closure . Wertheimer demonstrated that we do not react in uniform or constant ways to specific stimuli , as though they were isolated from one another , but that the nature of the setting in which they are found determines the way in which they are perceived . One of the most fundamental of the laws of perception is that a perceptual field is necessarily organized into figure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields in which figure and ground can alternate , for example , Rubin 's wife-mother-in-law ' drawing , but the principle is implicit in Wertheimer 's laws of organization . All the experiments of the Gestalt psychologists deny the basic premise of associationist sensationalism in their demonstration that the whole is other than the sum of its parts ' . The Gestalt psychologists drew important theoretical conclusions from these experiments . They concluded that it is not the self or any mental process which brings about the various forms of organization . The observer is unaware of how one stimulus influences another , so that we can not appeal to his consciousness . Accordingly , Gestalt psychologistsassume that the interaction occurs among the brain-correlatesp22of the perceptual facts in question . Thus , the theory asserts that psychological and neurophysiological processes are parallel or isomorphic . Stimuli in the perceptual field interact with one another in lawful ways and , in order to account for this fact , we must postulate that the brain functions as a field . Kohler ( 1940 ) , following the line of reasoning used by Faraday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the physiological correlate of a percept may be said to have a circumscribed , local existence , it neverthelessacts as a dynamic agent and extends into the surrounding tissue , and that , by this extension , its presence is represented beyond its circumscribed locus . In this way we can account for the dynamic organization of perception and other processes . This isomorphism , a term which signifies equality of structure , makes the assumption that the processes of organization occurring in the brain are identical with the structural processes discernible in perception and thinking . It is the assumed structural identity of these two processes which makes possible a physical-physiological explanation of psychological organization . As Koffka ( 1935 , p. 63 ) says : And now , with the tool of a thorough-going isomorphism in our hands , we return to our balance sheet which we drew up after stating the reasons why , when we come to fundamentals , we must choose a physiological field rather than the behavioural environment as our fundamental category . . . . We are no longer losing the advantage gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct our physiological field in accordance with , and directed by , the observed properties of it . Thus we have good reason for introducingand keeping the behavioural environment , even though we look ultimately for physiological explanations . The same viewpoint is expressed forcibly by Kohler ( 194o ) . The now-classical experiments on thinking in the Gestalt tradition are those by Kohler ( 1925 ) on problem-solving in apes , studies by Wertheimer ( 1945 ) on complex reasoning processes in humans , and Duncker 's ( 1945 ) work on factors influencing flexibility or the lack of it ( functional fixedness ) in problem-solving . The theory underlying this work is most clearly stated by Wertheimer . In opposition to both associationism and logical theory which , he maintains , ignore the structural nature of living thinking , Gestalt theory goes directly to these essential , structural processes . It is argued that when a problem is perceived , structural strains and stresses are established which , if thinking continues , yield vectors in the direction of improvement . Thep23solution of the problem represents a good structure ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the field . It can thus be seen that , in place of the isolated elements of the associationists , Gestalt psychology postulates that perceptual processes and factors of past experience exist in interrelationship to form a system , an organized whole or configuration . It is when an existing structure suffers stress , i.e. when the parts do not fit together , that what we call thinking ensues . Thinking is thus the process of reorganization which follows from the tension created by the organism 's perception of a problem . The successful accomplishment of this reorganization , when one solves the problem , signifies that insight has been acquired . Insight is that moment of sudden illumination , the Aha-experience ' , when aspects of the situation fall into place ' . It is insight that distinguishes thinking from blind associations and habits . We can appreciate readily how closely this theory of thinking is related to Gestalt views on the essentially organized nature of perception and to the isomorphism of psychological and physiological facts . In the first place , it is assumed that perception provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helson ( 1926 , p. 54 ) points out : For thinking to progress along logical lines it must proceed within a structure , and this structure is very often furnished in perception . The relation of objects to one another are given in phenomenal configurationswon in perception ' . This amounts to saying that perception provides the material for thinking , but , whereas for the associationist this material consisted of discrete elements , for the Gestalt theorist the material is already structured and consequently plays some part in determining the direction of thinking . Secondly , the relationship of this theory of thinking to the doctrine of isomorphism is implicit in Wertheimer 's dictum that structural reasons become causes in the process ' ( Wertheimer , 1945 , p. 239 ) . This can be interpreted to mean that the lack of equilibrium , which stimulates thinking and of which we are conscious when we recognize a problem , is paralleled by a lack of equilibrium in the cortical field and the creation of vectors of a neurophysiological nature which result in the solution of the problem . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychology ? Koffka ( 1935 ) believed that it did . He held that Gestalt psychology overcomes Husserl 's objection to a psychological explanation of thinking . Husserl 's argument , according to Koffka , restsupon the assumption that psychological relations are merely factual or. # , ? / external . Koffka is quite willing to concede that a psychologism based upon this assumption has indeed been refuted by Husserl.  |p24But  this refutation does not affect our psychologism ? if our theory can rightly be given this name ? since in our theory psychological and physiological , or rather psychophysical , processes are organized according to intrinsic or internal relations . This point can only be alluded to . It means that in our theory psychology and logic , existence and substance , even , to some extent , reality and truth , no longer belong to entirely different realms or universes of discourse between which no intelligible relationship exists . ( pp. 570-1 ) For Gestalt psychology , as we have seen , there are no absolutely unordered data in perception which must needs be associated in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption when he states that psychophysical processes are organized according to intrinsic or internal relations . In other words , from the outset our perceptions and thoughts consist of organized wholes , whose elements are interdependent by the very fact that they are perceived as wholes . Thus the relationships between these elements are not fortuitous and external but necessary and internal . In all thinking , the problem and the answer to it are not matters of chance ; the solution fits the problem like a key fits a lock . The problem creates tension in the system and the correct answer restores equilibrium . In reasoning we experience this process as a necessary and orderly affair : the solution achieves a restructuring of the field in the simplest or only possible way . Gestalt theory can , therefore , unlike the associationism it was designed to replace , claim to give an adequate explanation of logical Lthinking . This is Wertheimer 's conclusion in his book , Productive Thinking ( 1945 ) . By emphasizing the structural nature of thinking the theory avoids the pitfalls of both associationism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved in problemsolvingand , at the same time , that they are achieved by living thought and not in some extra-empirical realm . Indeed , Wertheimer characterizesthe traditional laws of logic , the laws of identity , contradiction , and so on , as merely limiting cases ' ( p. 255 ) because they are blind to the structure of living thought . For example , in traditional logic the term and ' may combine any two things or propositions , whether or not they belong to each other structurally . Thus , in the statement , Two is smaller than three and the snow is white ' , the actual content of each statement means nothing to the actual content of the other . But , Wertheimer says , this empty and ' is merely an extreme case . In living thought and ' is not generally used in this way . Instead , there is thep25and ' that combines two things which belong to each other , or there is the and ' that states two things are together which should not be together . These ands ' involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dynamics . And it is the same story with other traditional logical terms , which , according to Wertheimer , are extreme forms which are indifferent to the structural relatedness of living thought . We need , therefore , to develop a logic which deals with the logical features and rules of dynamic events , a logic of experience and the ways in which experience is structured . That Gestalt psychology was of immense importance to the psychologyof thinking can not be denied and will be evident from subsequent chapters . The idea that the task of the psychologist is to analyse the structural relations evident in thinking signified a major departure from the traditional schools of logicism and associationism . However , the theory 's importance stems , not from a wholesale acceptance of the Gestalt postulates by subsequent workers , but rather from their desire to recast the insights of the Gestalt psychologists into a more dynamic form . There are , in fact , grave doubts as to whether the Gestalt postulates , as they stand , afford a firm basis for understanding the nature and development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of productive thinking , Wertheimer ( 1945 ) cautions the reader not to misunderstand the meaning of Gestalt theory . He says ( p. 243 ) that when a picture is given here of the inner , structural dynamics in the determination of processes , it does not mean that in this development man is merely passive ' . On the contrary , it is assumed that problem-solving will be aided considerably by attitudes , such as openmindedness and the desire for improvement . But , given the assumptions essential to the theory , it seems impossible not to misunderstand ' it in the way that Wertheimer indicates . Thinking , Jt is argued , is determined by imbalances in perceptual and mnemonic configurations creating vectors which result in the solution of the problem . There is no mention here of how the activity of the person contributes materially to the attainment of a necessary answer . It is symptomatic of Gestalt theory 's primary concern with perception that Wertheimer should mention attitudinal factors , and not actions which the individual performs on the problem-material , as a defence against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists upon the influence on thinking of experience , both past and present , but this is perceptual experience , which for the Gestalt psychologists serves the same function in the thinking process as the sensations of the associationist . As Piaget ( 1950 ) puts it :  |p26In  attempting to reduce the mechanisms of intelligence to those characterizing perceptual structures , which are in turn reducible to physical Gestalten ' , the Gestalt theory reverts essentially to classical empiricism , although by far more refined methods . The only difference ( and considerable though it is , it has little weight in the face of such a reduction ) is that the new doctrine replaces ' associations ' by structured wholes ' . But in both cases operational activity in sensory processes fades into pure receptivity and abdicates in favour of the passivity of automatic mechanisms . ( p. 64 ) There are those who think this criticism unjustified . Merleau-Ponty ( 1964 ) , for example , points out that Gestalt psychologists , far from minimizing the role of experience , actually describe the development of different structures throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remarks that to the Gestalt psychologist the accumulation of experience makes possible a restructuring which will re-establish the equilibrium between the organism and its environment at another level . This is an on-going process , since new perceptual forms change the state of the organism with the result that subsequent perceptions interact with these changed organic conditions to originate other new forms , and so development continues . But one still might ask : how are we to describe this function of relating and restructuring the experience given in perception into new forms ? Here , Gestalt psychologists have little to offer , other than making use of such terms as insight ' and restructuring ' , which seem to do nothing more than draw a discrete veil over the process which is central to the psychology of thinking . Gestalt psychologists themselves came to recognize this deficiency , and Duncker 's ( 1945 ) monograph on functional fixedness was an attempt to rectify this state of affairs by an investigation of the ways in which fixation on the customary uses of objects can limit the ability to solve problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work has not , however , been taken up to any great extent and one reason for this may be the recognition that the Gestalt concepts themselves are not very useful for analysing the process and development of thinking . Indeed , although Piaget accuses the theory of falling into the same error as associationism , there is a sense , also , in which Gestalt theory is open to much the same criticism as was made against Husserl 's ideas . For the perceptual configurations of the Gestalt psychologists are given ' to the thinker rather like the way in which the ideal logical laws are present in the Husserlian conception . Admittedly , the former change in the course of the organism 's growth ,  |p27whilst  the latter are fixed and immutable , but there is still the problem of how the thinker makes use of these givens ' as he struggles to make his thoughts clear . For Husserl , the answer was direct intuition ' , for the Gestalt psychologists , insight ' . With both theories the explanation of thinking appears to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic and the psychology of thinking remains . How is it possible to describe and explain the development of thinking and at the same time do justice to the necessary relationships described by the laws of logic and of which we are aware in our acts of reasoning ? None of the theoretical standpoints considered so far has been able to solve this problem , logicism , associationism and Gestalt theory all suffering from some limitation . But Gestalt theory , with its concept of structure , has , I believe , prepared the ground for a solution of the problem which goes some way towards accounting both for the reality of concrete experience and the reality of logical forms . PIAGET 'S THEORYThis problem has been of central concern to Piaget , who , armed with an awareness of the difficulties involved , has proposed that logic and psychology may be reconciled if we accept the hypothesis that the intrinsic features of logic have their origin in the activities of the subject ' ( Beth and Piaget , 1966 , p. 136 ) . Piaget has outlined his views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Logic and Psychology ( Piaget , 1953 ) and , more fully , in Mathematical Epistemology and Psychology ( Beth and Piaget , 1966 ) . He has given his position the formal title of operationalism ' , after the notion of Bridgman ( 1927 ) that to define something in science is to specify what operations the scientist carries out . According to Piaget , the concept of operation ' serves as a link between logic and psychology , since , on the one hand , operations are actual , psychological activities , and on the other , they play an indispensablepart in logic , which can be regarded as a system of symbolic manipulations . Piaget ( 1953 ) proposes that there are three major alternatives to operationalism . The first of these is Platonism ' , which sees logic as a system of universals existing independently of experience and nonpsychologicalin origin . We have met this view in the consideration of Husserl 's theory and concluded , as does Piaget , that this doctrine fails to explain how the mind comes to discover such universals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic is nothing but a system of conventions or generally accepted rules . Ap28thorough-going , associationist empiricism , such as Mill 's , would supportthis idea , but , as Husserl 's critique of this type of psychologism demonstrated , this interpretation distorts the true meaning of logical laws . Conventionalism has , therefore , been replaced by the point of view of logical positivism ( e.g. Ayer , 1946 ) , which distinguishes empirical truths , or non-tautological relationships , and tautologies , or purely syntacticalrelationships . On this theory , logic is a well-formed language ' which expresses the empirical properties of objects as these are presented in perception ; logical relationships are therefore linguistic expressions which translate and code our observations of objects and events . Piaget opposes this thesis by denying that these observations can be experienced apart from logical relationships , for the latter provide the means whereby empirical truths are attained . As an example , he cites his experiments showing that , before the child is able to perceive the horizontal correctly , he must construct a spatial framework of reference , whose construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily have quoted from other experiments which are designed to illustrate the basic tenet of operationalism ? that intellectual developmentproceeds and empirical truths are reached through operations carried out either on objects directly or indirectly and symbolically . Thus , from this perspective it is false to separate perceptual facts ' from operations , since perception itself presupposes forms of organizationwhich interact with operations throughout development . Because of this interaction the child is not given a ready-made logic by his perceptions but must construct logical relationships in the course of his transactions with the world . What precisely does Piaget mean by an operation ? In answering this it is first necessary to emphasize the importance that he attaches to action in the development of thinking . This will be discussed in a more concrete way in the next chapter , but , for the time being , note that in Piaget 's system the development of intelligence begins with the infant actively exploring his environment and building up cognitive structures through the co-ordination of actions . To this , the first period of mental development , Piaget gives the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inter-relating of actions which the child performs . However , there comes a stage at which the child becomes capable of combining and co-ordinating actions internally , that is , without the necessity of actually carrying them out ; so , for example , if there were an obstacle in the way of a door opening fully , the child would initially have to carry out the action of opening the door to discover the impediment , but at a later age willp29be able to carry out this action in his mind , so that he will know he must remove the obstacle before opening the door . Piaget calls such internalizedactions operations when , in the course of subsequent development , they become organized into cognitive systems or structures . An operation represents an action and , just as actions become coordinated , so do operations develop into stable cognitive structures . The most significant operations for the developmental psychology of thinking are logical operations , such as classification , relation and implication . These , according to Piaget , must of necessity form into logical systems , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of others . Thus , for example , in order to classify , one must have a general ability to form other classes , one must be able to add classes together , or subtract one class from another , and so on . One can not consider the isolated operation , since this acquires its meaning from the system to which it belongs . This reiterates Gestalt theory about the relations of part and whole , but whereas the units of this theory had the passive quality of automatic mechanisms , the operations of Piagetian psychology emerge from the simple sensorimotoractivities of the infant and are capable of being further transformedthroughout development . Thus operationalism insists that logical operations develop from experience but it is essential to bear in mind that this is an experience which has to do with actions which the subject carries out on the objects around him . Accordingly , Piaget makes the distinction between physical experience ' and logico-mathematical experience . For example , when a child discovers that a big pebble is heavier than a small one , we can speak of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is weighing the pebbles in his hands , he discovers a property which already belonged to the pebbles before his action . On the other hand , when he puts five pebbles in a row and discovers that the number five ' remains the same whether he counts from left to right or from right to left , this experience is of a logico-mathematical nature because it does not relate to the pebbles themselves , but to the relations between the activity of ordering and forming a sum . What the child discovers is thus not a property of the pebbles as such but that the result of the operation of addition is independent of the order followed . This is , therefore , an abstraction from experience , but it is an abstraction from actions and not from objects . In the course of development these actions are internalized as operations , and it comes about that these operations can sooner or later be carried out symbolically without further attention being paid to objects themselves . In this mannerp30arise logic and mathematics which have to do with the manipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this logico-mathematical experience is not to be confused with psychological experience ' , in which we discover through introspection properties of the subject 's experience and behaviour , for example , that by working too long we become tired or that the action of ordering is difficult , and so on . Logico-mathematical experience is not concerned with such individual phenomena , but with the results of action in so far as they are objective and necessary , in other words , in so far as these results are separated from the individual and common to every subject carrying out the same action . A second important difference between logico-mathematical and psychological experience is that the latter may include any actions ( for example , laughing or sneezing ) whilst the former only includes actions which , once internalized , will be transformed into operations . Here , Piaget makes a fundamental point about the nature of those actions which become internalized as operations and which therefore provide the structures of logico-mathematical experience . He says ( Beth and Piaget , 1966 , p. 235 ) : In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in one direction or in the complementary direction ) , putting into correspondence , etc. , actions which form the starting point of the elementary operations of classes and relations , are not simply actions capable of being performed on external objects : they are primarily actions whose schemes express the general co-ordination of all actions , for every action ( from simple reflexes to actions which are learnt such as picking a flower or lighting a pipe ) presupposes at least one of the co-ordinations consisting of the ordering of successive movements or the combining of elements etc . This is why such schemes have a completely general significance and are not characteristic merely of one or another of the actions of a single individual . Piaget is asserting that all actions can be regarded as expressing , in however elementary a way , certain general features . The key word is co-ordination ' , which signifies the relating of actions into a whole . All activities , says Piaget , involve ordering and combining movements and there are general laws by which such co-ordinations are effected . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in various degrees of elaboration and in the sense that they are common to all subjects . At the sensori-motor level the rules are enacted and remain implicit in the infant 's activities , but at a later stage , through thep31internalization of actions and the formation of operations , we become capable of making explicit , conscious use of these rules and become aware of them as a system of possible transformations . The formal necessity inherent in logical and mathematical thinking may be accounted for , on this way of reasoning , by the fact that the actions and operations which are co-ordinated are not the peculiar actions of individual subjects but are actions common to all subjects ; Piaget describes them ( Beth and Piaget , p. 238 ) as the most general co-ordinations of every system of actions , thus expressing what is common to all subjects , and therefore referring to the universal or epistemic subject and not the individual one ' . These general schemes of action , the roots of which must be sought in the nervous and biologicalorganization of the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that logical laws are universal laws , in the sense that they relate to any objects whatever , is explained by their being rooted in the actions common to all subjects , whilst these actions themselves are rooted in the neurophysiological organization of man . Putting this conclusion in a slightly different form , one might say that logical laws are self-evident because they are expressions of the essential structures of action . On the issue of self-evidence ' Piaget is anxious to find a path between Platonism , which asserts that the self-evident rules are given once and for all and are thus independent of experience , and relativism , which assumes them to be dependent upon circumstances and thus self-evident in only the most restricted sense . In the first place , he distinguishes between the problems of self-evidence which arise in connection with physical experience and those connected with logico-mathematical experience . In the former , although physical truth is assessed by the use of logico-mathematical thinking and the concordance of empirical data with such thinking , that which is seen as self-evident at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , in logico-mathematical thinking , that which is self-evident at one time , for instance , the axioms of Euclidian geometry , is not refuted by new advances but takes its place within a more general system . Thus non-Euclidean geometry has not abolished Euclidean self-evidence , but has only limited its generality . It is true , therefore , that there is a succession of varieties of selfevidencebut , in the logical field , this should be conceived as a process of integration in which the general framework is expanded to include previous schemes as particular cases . Piaget maintains that this principle is apparent , not only in the history of logic and mathematics , but alsop32in the development of individuals , where the cognitive structures of one stage are integrated into those of the next . Logical operations develop from sensori-motor actions which , in turn , are determined by the structural properties of the nervous system . But , if logical operations are a continuation of sensori-motor activity , the question immediately arises : how can novel structures develop when the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizes that this consideration is crucial to his theory , and that , if he can not account for novelty , his theory runs the risk of ending with the absurd conclusion that the whole of logic and mathematics is contained preformed in advance in the co-ordination of actions , just as preformist embryologists thought they had discovered an homunculus in the spermatozoa or the ova . In answering this question , he makes the distinction between an invention and a discovery . He defines an invention ( Beth and Piaget , p. 204 ) as the creation of a new and free combination , not realized up to then either in nature or in the subject 's mind , although the elements that have been combined may have been already known . A discovery , on the other hand , is the process by which a subject becomes aware of an object till then unknown to him , but which existed in the same form before his discovery of it . America was discovered ; Esperanto was invented . Now , according to Piaget , mathematical constructions and creations can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation is not an invention , for the new elements in the creation are not free ' in the sense that they might be different ; there is , for instance , an element of arbitrariness in the invention of Esperanto , since other artificial languages could be and have been invented . At the same time , mathematicalcreation is not discovery in the sense defined above , because the created structure is not the same as the one from which it was derived . Thus , when the child discovers that the result of an addition is independentof the order followed , the creative process consists of translating a succession of material actions into a system of internalized operations . This is more than discovery , since there is a reconstruction on a new level of cognitive functioning and the attainment of a more general structure . Piaget is thus led to state that the relationship between the early sensori-motor stage and later stages consists of the latter actualizing the possibilities inherent in the former . This means that the elementary sensori-motor structures involve a whole series of possible developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actualization of some of them . These later , novel structures are at once new and nonarbitrary ; they are new , because they are not contained in the earlierp33structures , and they are non-arbitrary , because they are contained in a predetermined framework of possibilities ' ( Beth and Piaget , p. 303 ) . The paradox of logico-mathematical creation is that the subject actively constructs the solution of the problem and yet experiences the solution as a necessary result of his activities . The task that Piaget has set himself , therefore , is to describe the emergence of the structures of logico-mathematical thinking from the sensori-motor activities of the infant . The theory would be incomplete , however , if he did not also explain why structures develop as they do . What , in brief , causes the progression from simpler to more complex and general levels ? With this question we are beginning to exceed the bounds of this chapter , but Piaget 's answer to it can be given in outline . In fact , his views on this issue are implicit in the contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibilities inherent in the simpler ones . If this is the case , then a principle is called for which will explain how structures develop from one another in a non-arbitrary and definite manner . For Piaget , this principle is the idea of equilibration ' . He maintains that the organism attempts to establish a state of equilibrium or balance with its environment ; when this is attained we may speak of the organism being adapted to its environment . This is regarded , not as a closed , but as an open and dynamic equilibrium , and , Piaget ( 1950 ) argues , there is an autonomous tendency for development to progress from relatively unstable to more and more stable forms of adaptation , presumably within the limits set by the organism 's physical capacities . Thus , to take an extreme case , the adaptation of the subject who can think in abstract terms and hypothetically is more stable than that of the sensori-motor subject , since the latter is governed by the here and now and by the immediate consequences of his actions , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , present and future . The development of adaptationand the development of the logical structures of thinking are , on this view , parallel , since both arise through the process of equilibration ' . We are now in a position to state Piaget 's views on the relationship between logic and psychology . He does not assert that one is reducible to the other , but , rather , that logic is the formal study of operational structures , whilst the psychology of thinking studies their real functioningand development ( Piaget , 1949 ) . Logic is concerned with the problems of formal deductions from axioms while psychology studies the development of logical structures . There is thus a complete independence of methods and a possible correspondence of problems ; a methodological independence , since one can not invoke psychologicalp34facts to solve problems of formal logic , nor formal logical procedures to explain the necessity inherent in logical laws or the development of structures which account for this necessity ; and a possible correspondenceof problems , since the problems solved by formal logic can correspond to psychological questions , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psychological structure , either one common to all thinking at a certain stage of development or , at least , to a structure in the mind of the logician , and , conversely , every structure attained by the constructions of the individual can be understoodin formal terms . Therefore , logic and psychology reflect one another , because , while remaining autonomous in their methods , they are complementary . Consequently , since each discipline raises problems for the other , it is the task of empirical research , in which psychologists and logicians collaborate , to study these common problems . Bruner ( in Harms , 196o ) has suggested that this is a circular argument , for , having described thought structures in terms of formal logic , how can we then establish parallels between the laws of logic and the laws of thought ? To be sure , there is a limitation imposed by looking at thinking through the language of formal logic , since the language we choose will determine what we find . But this is a general condition of all inquiry and hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice of a logical language in particular . However , the major misconception underlying the criticism of circularity is that it ignores the fact that the methods of the two disciplines are radically different , the one being empirical , the other formal . Thus , there is nothing circular about verifying results obtained by two different methods against one another . Complementariness is , at least in principle , sought for , and not merely assumed . Bruner agrees with Piaget , though , that formal logic is a very powerful tool for analysing thinking because of the interconnectedness of its propositions ; for example , if the child asserts one logical relationship , we can inquire whether he understands the full logical implications of the assertion by making use of the interconnected formal rules of logic . But , says Bruner ( p. 26 ) , this finding is certainly not correspondence of logic and thought any more than that between behaviour and geometry by virtue of the fact that for a person to walk from A to C , the two separated by region B , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be clear on this point . It is not , as Bruner seems to maintain , simply the interconnectednessof formal logic which ensures its usefulness , since a formal system can contain many highly connected propositions and still be quite irrelevant to actual thought . Indeed , it is difficult to understandp35how the analyses of formal logic can be so useful if there is not some correspondence with the psychology of thinking , if , in short , formal logic is not a language which corresponds well to the reality of human thinking . As Piaget points out ( Beth and Piaget , p. 311 ) , it is not a question of using the language of formal logic to describe thought structures merely because this is a convenient and precise language or a stimulus to the imagination . The fundamental reason for this usage is that the logician 's thought is the most articulated form of human thought ' . This means that there is a continuity between ordinary and logical thought and that the latter can be used in the study of the former precisely because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which it is based . DISCUSSIONThe question posed at the beginning of this chapter concerned the nature of the rules in the process of thinking . We have looked at a number of answers to this question of how the thinker makes use of such rules and how these rules are derived . The choice appears to be between , on the one hand , the doctrine that rules exist a priori and , on the other , various versions of the idea that such rules are derived from experience and arise in the course of development . The former is hardly a satisfactory standpoint for the psychology of thinking since it leaves the question of the relationship between the existing subject and the rules an unsolvable mystery , but the doctrine 's central insight , especially evident in Husserl 's writings , that logical rules are , in some sense , necessary and self-evident , does pose a problem for psychological theories . Of these , associationism and Gestalt theory seem to offer inadequate or incomplete solutions , the former because , essentially , it has no means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is unable to account for the development of cognitive structures ( to which necessary relationships are due ) and for the role of the actions of the individual in problem-solving . The most plausible thesis is an operational theory of thinking which regards cognitive structures as systems of internalized actions ( operations ) and which can , therefore , explain both the development of thinking and the fact that solutions to problems are necessary and not fortuitous . Before we consider Piaget 's operationalism in greater detail , however , there are a number of major issues which arise from a comparison of his views with other theories already outlined . No attempt will be made , for the moment , to evaluate opinion on these issues ; rather , theyp36are stated simply to provide a framework for viewing the more detailed exposition of Piaget 's theory . The similarities between the operationalisms of Dewey and Piaget are striking . Besides the common emphasis upon activity , rather than sensations or perceptions , there is the parallel between Piaget 's internalization of actions ' and Dewey 's distinction between operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical forms as originating in action and the operations of inquiry and both make a distinction between physical and **28;2476;TOOLONG , the latter deriving from abstraction from actions and , therefore , as Dewey says , testable only by its nonincompatibilitywith other operations . But there are also very basic differences between them . In the first place , Dewey would , no doubt , reject Piaget 's notion of the epistemic subject ' and the idea that sensori-motor activities constitute a predetermined framework of possibilities for intellectual development . Dewey would in all probabilityassert that this idea is nothing but a resurrection of rationalist conceptions of innate properties of the mind and argue , instead , that the worth of ideas is not to be tested by their conformity to an a priori framework but by the consequences of their operation . Conception and systems of conceptions , ends in view and plans , are constantly making and remaking as fast as those already in use reveal their weaknesses , defects and positive values . There is no predestined course they must follow . Human experience consciously guided by ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed by their means is an opportunity for new ideas and ideals . ( Dewey , 1930 , p. 161 ) It is apparent from these views that operationalism by itself does not resolve the conflict between empiricism and rationalism ; it results merely in a reformulation of the problem . A second difference between Piaget and Dewey concerns the role of language , or , more generally , symbols , in the development of thinking . Piaget characteristically speaks about the internalization of actions , giving the impression that symbols themselves play , at most , a subsidiary role . For Dewey , on the other hand , it is the invention of symbols which enables us to carry out internalized operations and thus to begin to think . He distinguishes two kinds of symbols , those tied to particular contexts ? mainly , one supposes , words ? and the technical symbols of scientific thinking . Again we are confronted with a major issue , for some theorists have claimed thatp37thinking is dependent upon language , while others have asserted its independence . Piaget 's theory agrees with Gestalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure and to equilibrium as the driving force of thinking , although in Piaget 's theory the parts of the structure are conceived as actions and operations . However , a most important difference between the two theories centres around their conceptions of the nature of logical rules . Wertheimer ( 1945 ) suggested that we need to develop a logic of experience which would reflect the structures of living thought . But there is a fundamental difference between the two positions . In Piaget 's case , the laws discernible in thinking derive their universality from being abstractions from actions common to all men , and therefore they are ultimately independent of particular situations . For Wertheimer , on the other hand , logical terms derive their different meanings from the various contexts in which they occur and they will only be universal in so far as these contexts are universal . At this point one can argue either that there are certain preoccupations common to all men or that the diversity of human environments and purposes precludes the existence of universal laws of thinking . This is a weighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more empirical formulation . A major issue which emerges from a comparison of Wertheimer 's and Piaget 's views concerns the relative influence of situational and operational factors . To what extent , for instance , do language , social norms and structures , and the technologies of different societies influence the development of operational thinking and how do they exert their influence ? These questions can , of course , be investigated by cross-cultural studies . Piaget argues that the development of logical thinking is due to the progressive adaptation of the human organism to its environment . Husserl ( 1900 ) , on the other hand , has contested the view that the facts of adaptation can be used to explain the laws of logical thinking , since this amounts to confusing actual cases with ideal principles . It has been argued that Husserl has drawn too sharp and drastic a distinction between the ideal and the real , but , at the same time , it must be admitted that it is by no means obvious why , in Piaget 's scheme , progressive adaptation and the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems that the correspondence of the two is impossible , if adaptation implies some form of adjustment to the demands of particular situations and if , as Piaget assumes , logical structures are universal and thus independent of particular contexts . Clearly , Piaget 's views on this issue need to be examined more fullyp38before any evaluation can be made , but , since this seems to be an assumption basic to his whole theory , it is evident that particular attention must be given to the way in which he states the relationship between adaptation and the development of logical rules . This review of theories of the relationship between logic and psychology thus leads to the general conclusion that , although operationalismappears to be the most plausible thesis , there are a number of basic questions which must be directed towards Piaget 's theory . This discussion indicates four questions . Does the development of logical thinking inevitably follow a course determined by the universal nature of sensori-motor actions ? What is the relationship of language and other symbolic forms to the development of thinking ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can the facts of adaptation account for the development of logical thinking ? We shall return to these questions in our assessment of Piaget 's theory and the work which it has inspired . In summary , thinking may be defined as problem-solving but the essential feature of this activity , if it is to qualify as reasoning or logical thinking , is an adherence to certain rules . A central problem for the psychology of thinking is , therefore , to account for the relationship between the psychological subject and these rules , which confer upon his thinking the qualities of rigour and necessity . Formal logic has long been concerned with the elaboration of rules of reasoning , so that the question may be recast into the form : what is the relationship between logic and psychology ? Husserl advanced the argument that logical laws deal with absolutely necessary and self-evident relationships , with the result that psychology , which is an empirical discipline whose laws can only be expressed as probabilities , is not in a position to explain these relationships . This argument , convincing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to Gestalt psychology , which replaced atomistic associations by the concept of structure : the interrelationsof parts of a structure are necessary and not fortuitous . However , Gestalt psychology itself had no place for the operational activity of the subject in problem-solving and tended to reduce intelligence to perceptual structures . Piaget 's solution to this problem is to insist that the intrinsic features of logic have their origins in the activity of the subject ' . His theory retains the Gestalt notion of structure ( although the parts are now conceived as actions and operations ) , but he suggests that structures develop through a process of abstraction from one 's actions . This development is seen as an actualization of the possibilities inherent in the elementary structures provided by sensori-motor experience.  |p39PIAGET  'S VIEWS ON EXPLANATION IN PSYCHOLOGYPiaget began his career as a zoologist , studying the behaviour of molluscs and , especially , the ways in which these creatures adapt to their different environments . At the same time , he informs us ( in Tanner and Inhelder , 1956a ) , he was taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the sciences . Feeling that the approaches of philosophers to these problems were far too speculative and not sufficiently experimental , he decided to spend Your or five years ' studying the development of logical thinking in the child . This interim study has turned out to be his life 's work , spanning a period of some forty years . Piaget 's work during this period has taken many forms and has been concerned with diverse problems , but there is a remarkable continuity in this research , a continuity which originates in his initial interest in problems of biology and the philosophy of knowledge . These constitute a dialectic underlying all the theory and research , for , on the one hand , there are the facts pertaining to man as a physical organism ? the facts of biology and neurophysiology which indicate that man is equipped with a certain physico-chemical structure and that he must adapt to his environment in order to survive , while , on the other hand , are the constructions of man the thinker ? the social and physical sciences themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical problem , which arises from the confrontation of these two sets of data , is , broadly stated : how do we formulate the relationship between human achievements , which include scientific laws and generalizations , and those conditions which science asserts determine our experience and behaviour ? The research which Piaget has undertaken represents an attempt to answer this question ? the question of the nature and status of human knowledge ? by experiment and observation , but there is implicit in this researchp40a particular way of formulating the nature of this dialectic and , by generalization , a particular conception of the nature of explanation in psychology . Piaget has recently made explicit his views on the question of explanation ( Piaget , Fraisse and Reuchlin , 1968 ) . He identifies seven main types of explanation . The first four of these are reductionist , differing principally in the type of substrate to which psychological processes are reduced . Thus , we have explanation by reduction to a psychogenetic principle , as , for instance , with the Freudian notion that adult personality is largely a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions , reduction to physical and to organic processes . The second group of explanations are , Piaget believes , complementary to reductionist models . These include behavioural explanations of the type favoured by Hull or Skinner , in which consequences are deduced from certain principles but no assumptions are made about the kind of reductionism , to which behavioural laws will eventually be submitted ; a second **26;2506;TOOLONG is the genetic , which consists , as in Piaget 's own work on the development of operational structures , in tracing the development of processes as a result of the transactions of the subject with his environment ; and , finally , there is explanation based upon abstract models , in which a formal scheme , such as probability theory , information theory or formal logic , is used to make deductions , often novel and unexpected , which can then be tested against actual behaviour . Piaget argues that it is not a question of deciding that one , and one only , of these methods is correct . Rather , he believes that a psychologicalexplanation must be both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an explanation is to find a means of accounting for the uniqueness of conscious events while at the same time allowing for the eventual reduction of these events to their factual origins . The uniqueness of conscious events is evident from the fact that we can not appeal to the laws of neurophysiology to explain the validity of the law of relativity , or why 2+2 = 4 , or why the individual normally obeys social conventions . But equally there is no doubt that the recognition of all these truths is dependent upon a system of nervous connections , so that the formulation and acceptance of these truths must be consistent with laws which neurophysiology and biology will elaborate . Piaget maintains , then , that the adoption of abstract models , such as logic and probability theory , is indispensable for understanding the uniqueness of conscious constructions , but thatp41this does not preclude the reduction of these to their physical and organic bases . What is the peculiar nature of these constructions ? Piaget observes that the truth of 2+ 2 = 4 is not the cause ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way that a cannon causes the movement of billiard balls or a stimulus is one of the causes of a reaction . In the same way , the value attributed to an aim or moral obligation is not the cause ' of an action connected with the obligation . In both cases we talk , not of causes , but of implications , and this is because consciousness consists of systems of relations or meanings . There are deductive , implicational systems which receive expression in logic and mathematics , as well as aesthetic implications and valuational implications , formalized in systems of ethics , law and social conventions . In all these instances , says Piaget , consciousness is essential in order to judge truth and value , that is , to reach the implications which specifically characterize them . The fruit of this argument is , then , the assertion that the idea of causality does not apply to consciousness , since one state of consciousness implies rather than causes another . We are now in a position to understand the virtue of abstract models for the description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they disregard questions of causality which characterize the various reductionist explanations . Abstract models themselves operate with implications and deductions ; they can be valid independentof any reference to concrete , causal agencies , and can , therefore , be powerful tools in analysing conscious processes . But if implication is the form of explanation applicable to conscious constructions and causality that appropriate to physical and physiological systems , it would appear that they are mutually exclusive and can not , therefore , be related . Piaget 's solution to this dilemma is to suggest that the two sets of data are ultimately reconcilable , since the relationshipbetween systems of implication and systems of causality is that of isomorphism . The clearest example of such isomorphism is provided by electronic computers which are capable of solving complex problems . Each operation which the computer uses is parallel or isomorphic with a logical or mathematical operation , so that there is complete isomorphismbetween the conscious system of operations and the mechanical system . The machine itself is contructed according to the principles of electronics and engineering and is therefore governed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsehood of the propositions is a matter for conscious evaluation by means of the rules of implication of deductive reasoning . Piaget is fond of pointing to the research of McCulloch and Pins ( 1943 ) which appears to demonstrate thep42isomorphism of nervous functioning with the relational system of propositionallogic . This work , he maintains , holds out the hope that we shall eventually be able to describe the complete isomorphism between neurophysiological processes and those logico-mathematical operations which represent the highest achievements of human thought . However , the doctrine of isomorphism between physical-causal and conscious-implicational data does not answer the question of how higher levels of thinking develop from elementary biological mechanisms . If the brain and consciousness can be compared to a computer in the sense that mechanical and deductive-implicational analyses are complementary , we have still to account for the development of these parallel physical and psychological operations . Indeed , this is Piaget 's central concern , for he has stated on a number of occasions ( e.g. Piaget , 1950 , 1967 ) that his work is directed at explaining how superior levels of scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which he has framed the question of the nature and status of human knowledge ? the question of epistemologywhich has been traditionally answered by pure speculation . Piaget insists that this is an empirical question and , to understand the full implications of his psychological theory and research , it is essential to bear in mind his dual concern with problems of biology and epistemology . But it is clearly not sufficient to point to an isomorphism of causality and implication to account for the development of **29;2534;TOOLONG , since we require dynamic concepts to explain their emergence . Thus , although it is necessary to construct abstract models to analyse conscious constructions and reductionist models to account for the causation of physical and organic systems , we also require developmental or genetic concepts . The explanation of thinking requires that we pursue three complementary lines of inquiry ; we need concepts dealing with physical and neurophysiological processes , abstract models to handle implicational relations , and genetic concepts to explain how such implicational thinking develops . For Piaget , the results of these approaches will eventually prove complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of structures , which can be described either in physical-causal or in conscious-implicational terms . The genetic concepts are , therefore , fundamental , in so far as it is their task to account for the dynamics of physical systems and the dynamics of conscious experience . Consequently , our exposition of Piaget 's theory must begin with a discussionaimed at discovering just how Piaget proposes that such concepts can fulfil this function.  |p43THE  BASIC DEVELOPMENTAL CONCEPTSAdaptationIn his early studies of the behaviour of molluscs Piaget had become interested in the ways in which they adapted to their environment . His theory of thinking takes a cue from biology in that adaptation is accepted as a principle which holds for both biology and psychology . One of the most fundamental functions of living matter is that of incorporating into its structure nutrition-providing elements from the outside . The organism sustains itself and grows by means of such transactions with the environment . Piaget noted that there are certain invariant attributes of this kind of functioning . First , the organism must transform the substances it takes in in order to incorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be incorporated without being changed in some way . The process of changing elements in the environment in such a way that they can be incorporated into the structure of the organism is called assimilation . The manner in which the element is changed may vary , but the process as such always occurs when adaptation takes place . Secondly , in assimilating foodstuffs the organism is also adjusting itself to them ? it may secrete digestive juices , open its mouth , and so on . Just as objects are adjusted to the peculiar nature of the organism , as in assimilation , so also must the organism adjust itself to the demands of the object . This latter process is called accommodation . However , although assimilation and accommodationcan be distinguished conceptually and this distinction serves a useful purpose , in reality they are indissociable : every assimilation involves an accommodation and , conversely , every accommodation involves assimilation . The continuity between biological and intellectual functioning is provided for in Piaget 's system by the proposition that intellectual functioning is also characterized by the processes of assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that every cognitive encounter with an environmental object or event necessarily involves some kind of cognitive structuring of that object or event in accordance with the nature of the organism 's existing intellectual organization . Thus every act of intelligence , however rudimentary , presupposes an interpretation of something in external reality , that is , an assimilation of that something to some kind of meaning system in the organism 's cognitive organization . At the same time , in every cognition there has to be some coming to grips ' with or accommodationto the properties of the thing apprehended . The essence ofp44accommodation consists in adapting oneself to the requirements and demands which the world of objects imposes upon one . Although in reality assimilation and accommodation are indissociable , behaviour may show different degrees of one or the other . A simple accommodationto external reality signifies an imitation of or a conformity to the external event without the degree of assimilation necessary for a meaningful interaction of subject and object . At the other extreme , simply assimilating an event to existing structures signifies that no attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which thus remains a mere expression , or , in psychoanalytic parlance , a projection of that structure . It is therefore clear that both assimilation and accommodation are necessary for an organism to adapt to and know ' its environment , since the characteristics of both organism and event can be related only when both are present . It can not be emphasized too much that the basic unit of analysis provided by the adaptation model is the organism within its environmentand not the organism and its environment or just the organism . Furth ( 1969 ) expresses this well when he writes that the term ' adaptation ' introduces the fruitful notion that organism and environment are two interlocking systems . Environmental events do not impose their nature upon a passive organism any more than the organism produces whatever results it desires on an indifferent environment . From the start subject and environment are intimately related , for the living organism is at birth provided with certain ways of orientating itself and behaving towards its environment and these characteristic patterns provide a framework for the influence of environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment itself in its spatial and temporal organization provides a setting for the activities of the organism . Organism and environment are , therefore , adapted to one another initially in the sense that each provides a framework for the influence of the other . As adults we are accustomed to thinking of subject and object as two separate categories , but this is , as Piaget has demonstrated , the result of a later stage of thinking and the adoption of this distinction to describe the primary relationship between subject and environment only results in a failure to grasp their inherent interrelatedness . One further implication of the adaptation model may be brought out at this point . In analysing the functions of assimilation and accommodation in the organism-environment interaction , Piaget wishes to convey the idea that this interaction is dynamic and progressive . Pure assimilatory activity and simple accommodation to external events alike involve no genuine intellectual development ,  |p45because  both lack the essential element of confrontation between subject and object . A crucial aspect of adaptive behaviour , on the other hand , is that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can speak loosely of the subject knowing ' more about his environment , without , of course , assuming that this is necessarily a conscious knowledge . Thus , just as at the biological level the organism grows by the assimilation of foodstuffs , so at the psychologicallevel each adaptive transaction between subject and environmentresults in a change in the intellectual condition of the subject . Subsequent transactions build upon these acquisitions so that developmentproceeds in an orderly fashion . To understand the characteristics of this orderly growth and to appreciate that it contains its own dynamic , we must now define two further concepts ? the concepts of structure and equilibration . StructureThe concept of structure refers to the fact that elements are interrelated and organized . This notion is implicit in the description of adaptationas involving two interlocking systems , for to talk of a system is to 11 signify that there are lawful relationships which characterize and , indeed , constitute the system . Piaget has emphasized that assimilation and accommodation can not occur without some form of organization : Organization is inseparable from adaptation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the internal aspect of the cycle of which adaptation constitutes the external aspect . . . . The accord of thought with things ' and the accord of thought with itself ' express this dual functional invariant of adaptation and organization . These two aspects of thought are indissociable : it is by adapting to things that thought organizes itself and it is by organizing itself that it structures things . ( Piaget , 1952a , p. 8 ) 11It can be seen that structuring ' and organization are , for Piaget , at the very heart of behaviour : all intelligent behaviour involves a structuring or restructuring of the environment , some sort of organization within which it proceeds . What does Piaget mean by a cognitive as distinct from a physiological structure ? In the case of organic adaptation , the interaction is of a material nature and it involves a physical transaction between a part of the body and a part of the external environment . Psychological or cognitive transactions are , however , functional in nature ; in thesep46instances , although we still speak of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are subsumed under the particular activities of the organism . For example , a child confronted with a novel object will act towards that object in certain characteristic ways , striking out at it , grasping , and so on . The object itself undergoes no change , but it is incorporated into existing structures . Similarly , in this example the child 's actions may be modified by the particular features of the object , for , in so far as the object is novel , new and possibly finer co-ordinations of actions will be necessary . Thus cognitive structures are , in the first instance , organizations of actions developed through adaptation . This is what Piaget means by the complementarinessof the accord of thought with itself ' and the accord of thought with things ' , since in the process of adapting to objects and events our actions become interco-ordinated . But , although assimilation and accommodation invariably occur in all behaviour , cognitive structures themselves undergo transformations as development proceeds . The structures of the infant are different from those of the child or the adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures which typify different levels of intellectual development and the process by which such structures develop from one another . In describing the way in which external reality is assimilated and accommodated to , Piaget makes use of the concept of scheme. * A scheme may be defined as the organization of an adaptive action , in short , as a particular cognitive structure . Following Flavell ( 1963 ) , instead of giving an exhaustive , formal definition of a scheme , it may be helpful to list certain of its attributes to illustrate the manner in which Piaget uses the concept . In the first place , a scheme is defined by the behaviour sequence to which it refers . Thus , in talking about early , sensori-motor development , Piaget speaks of the scheme of sucking , grasping , sight , and so on . This use signifies that a scheme is a particular organization of an activity . With respect to later developments , Piaget refers to the utilization of logical rules , such as relation or classification , as operational schemes : these too are organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions , these are ' internalizedactions ' , covertly performed . But , secondly , if Piaget does define schemes of action by the type of action they represent , he does not mean that they are those sequences and nothing else . In talking of* In most English translations of Piaget 's work the term schema ' is used . However , Piaget and Inhelder ( 1966 ) have made a distinction between a scheme and a schema ( see below ) and , in order to give an accurate account of the theory , it is desirable to adhere to the Geneva convention.  |p47a  scheme he wishes to imply that assimilatory functioning has generated a specific cognitive structure . For example , in the case of the scheme of grasping , he intends to convey , not just that the infant shows grasping behaviour , but that he has an organized disposition to grasp objects on repeated occasions . Similarly , once in possession of a logical scheme , the child will apply this course of action to the problems he meets . The final consequence of this usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , functionally equivalent to the physiologicaldigestive organ in that it constitutes an instrument for incorporating aspects of reality . Piaget has elaborated this latter notion in a work ( Piaget , 1967 ) , in which he makes fully explicit the biological basis of his theory and , in particular , the assumptions that cognitive functions extend organic regulations and that they are a differentiated organ which regulates exchanges with the external environment . Intellectual development entails an increasing differentiation of this organ with the complementary increase in the power to differentiate aspects of the external environment . It must be emphasized that in using such terminology Piaget is not merely resorting to a figure of speech . On the contrary , he wishes to place his theory firmly within a biological perspective in order to carry out his programme of tracing the emergence of thinking from the biological facts of adaptation . Schemes range from the simple reflex activities of the infant to the complex problem-solving strategies of the adult . However , all schemes possess the quality of being organized wholes and of having component actions which are closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all schemes . All schemes , once constituted , apply themselves again and again to assimilable aspects of the environment . Piaget speaks of reproductive or functional assimilation in referring to this tendency of schemes to repetition . Secondly , in the course of their repeated use , schemes extend their field of application to assimilate new and different objects . This is called generalizing assimilation . Thirdly , schemes are said to undergo internal differentiation . In the course of his repeated contact with objects the subject is able to make increasingly finer discriminations between them ; the result of this is a recognition ' of the different properties of objects , so that Piaget refers to this function of the operation of schemes as recognitory assimilation . EquilibrationThe concepts of adaptation and structure describe the organism functioning within its environment but they leave open the question of the development of the organism . To account for the developmentp48of structures Piaget introduces the concept of equilibration . This is one of the most important ideas in Piaget 's theory and it needs , therefore , to be defined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept is the volume reporting the deliberations of a symposium , sponsored by the World Health Organization ( Tanner and Inhelder , 1956b ) , in which a discussion of this concept figures largely . One way of approaching the concept is through the analysis of certain skilled activities which show particularly clearly how the individual learns to balance one activity against another . The paradigm for such performance would , perhaps , be a man learning to walk a tightrope . Piaget himself , in the same volume , gives the more mundane example of a man driving a car along an icy road . Suppose that he initially tends to slide to the left ; he will make a correction to the right , which will tend to make him slide back to the right ; he corrects this with a movement to the left and he slides to the left , and so on . At first the corrections the man makes will be too gross , but , as he becomes more skilled , he reduces his corrective movements and eventually is able to make corrections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But note that even when a man has acquired the skill , the result is best described , not as a final state of equilibrium , but as an on-going process which maintains equilibrium . In short , equilibrium is not final , but is in the process of being attained . This is because the skilled performance involves a series of compensatory activities in which the results of one action are balanced by the effects of a reverse action . This is why Piaget prefers to speak of equilibration or mobile equilibrium ' . This example is but a particular case of the mechanism which Piaget sees as being fundamental to development at all levels . Equilibrationis the internal dynamic , not only of actions , but also of perception and thinking . Several authors ( e.g. Dewey , 1910 ) have hinted at the same idea in their assertion that the search for the solution of a problem follows upon the experience of some stress or lack of equilibrium in the person 's situation . Piaget would no doubt agree with this idea , but his formulation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , for him , lack of equilibrium would not be just a condition that the organism happens to get itself into ; rather , equilibration refers to an intrinsic drive on the part of the organism and it is an essential function of all living systems . Secondly , and following from the first consideration , this tendency towards equilibrium is applicable to all types of structures which can be regarded as forming different levels . . . succeeding one another according to a law of development ,  |p49such  that each one brings about a more inclusive and stable equilibrium for the processes that emerge from the preceding level ' ( Piaget , 1950 , p. 7 ) . On this view , therefore , the development of thinking is the emergence of more and more stable cognitive structures as the actionstructuresof the infant give way to the perception-linked structures of the young child , which , in turn , are superseded by the operational structures of older children . Thus , with respect to the sensori-motor actions of the infant , there is a development in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his assimilatory and accommodatory activities into a balanced relationship , as , for instance , when he acquires the ability to grasp an object placed in front of him , he simultaneously accommodates to the properties of the object and assimilates that object to the co-ordinated schemes of sight and grasping . Piaget speaks , therefore , of adaptation as an equilibrium of assimilation and accommodation . Similarly , in studying the development of perception ( Piaget , 1969 ) , he stresses the regulating activity of equilibration in compensating for the deforming effects of single acts of fixation . Perceptual adaptation requires that the subject scan the perceptual field and maximize his encounters with it , so that his attention is not centred unduly upon one aspect of it . Perception may , accordingly , be described as the maintenance of a mobile equilibrium between successive centrations and decentrations . But the equilibrium of perception and of action is never complete , since it must be achieved anew at every encounter with the environment . On the other hand , at the next level of development , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we can , for the first time , speak about equilibrium being final . For example , when a child has managed to construct a series of whole numbers , then this structure will remain in equilibrium until death , unless the individual becomes insane . Piaget wishes to assert that once such an operational structure has been formed , it exists in a stable and permanent form , although , of course , it will be integrated into other systems as the individual 's intellectual development progresses . Moreover , this equilibrium is not a state of rest , since the individual will continue to make use of this structure in his encounters with objects and with other people . It is , therefore , an equilibrium which is characterized by mobility and activity . Since operational equilibrium is characterized in this way , it is continuous with the preceding structures of sensori-motor activity and perception . Indeed , it is Piaget 's purpose to explain how thinking develops from these elementary activities . The equilibrium attainedp50by thinking can , therefore , be represented as a progressive extension of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the car-driver on the icy road maintained a course by a series of compensatory activities , so the development of logical thinking can be described as an increase in the ability to balance intellectual operations by a number of internal compensations . These compensations take different forms , which can be defined in the language of logic , but the essential feature of thinking is reversibility . An action or a perceptual centration can be regulated by compensatory actions or decentrations , but the equilibrium is always less than complete . Operational structures , on the other hand , are completely reversible : addition can be reversed by subtraction , the act of seriating objects , say , according to size , can be reversed , so that A #@# B #@# C becomes C ( ( B ( ( A , etc . Consequently , Piaget regards reversibility as the necessary result of the equilibration process , for an equilibrated system entails the compensatory functions of negation and reciprocal operations . Stages of Intellectual DevelopmentOne other essential concept is that of a stage . The development of thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing or structuring . This point of view implies that it is profitable to consider intellectual development as falling into a number of qualitative stages , each with its distinct structural characteristics . It is important to realize that these stages are not discrete in the sense that the child steps out ' of one stage into another . The whole process is a continuous one and Piaget goes to great pains in his work to demonstratethe existence of substages , in which patterns of behaviour are of a type intermediate between two major stages . But , although development is continuous , there seem to be certain decisive periods , in which accelerations in intellectual development occur . As Inhelder ( in Tanner and Inhelder , 1956a ) has put it , it happens as if a slow preparationculminated in an achievement . Piaget ( 1956 ) has listed five criteria for the existence of stages . He points out that the criteria are degrees of the possible structuration of stages and that one criterion alone may be sufficient to define a stage in other fields . However , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in operation . The criteria are : ( 1 ) There should be a constant order of succession , that is , behaviour typifying the first stage must always precede behaviour characterizing the second , and so on.  |p51(2)  There should be an integration of the acquisition of one stage into the following stages . Pinard and Laurendeau ( 1969 ) suggest that this may be interpreted to mean that the actions or operations which existed in one form or perhaps independently of one another at an earlier stage may be restructured or co-ordinated and this integration marks a new level of development. ( 3 ) Consequently , one stage may be regarded as a preparation for the next , which , conversely , represents an achievement with respect to the preceding level. ( 4 ) There should be a whole structure ' , or structure d'ensemble ' , characterizing the total aspects of the stage . This refers to the theoretical assumption that actions or operations are closely interconnected to form a unity or structure . In view of the importance that Piaget attaches to the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the criteria and its application presents a very strict test of the stage concept , since it implies that if , say , operations x , y and z are assumed to form a structure , and if the subject is capable of x , then , other things being equal , he ought to be capable of operations y and z. ( 5 ) The stage should signify the attainment of a level of equilibrium . From the equilibrium model we can infer that there are all kinds of intermediate structures , but these are difficult to define because of their instability , whereas the equilibrium levels marking stages attain the stability of reversible structures . Of these criteria , ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) seem to be most amenable to operationalformulation , so that the experimental testing of the stage concept has centred around these . One qualification must , however , be made with reference to the fourth criterion . Given that a child possesses a cognitive structure characteristic of a certain stage , this does not mean that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which confront him . For example , Piaget has shown that , whilst the child may recognize that the total mass or quantity of an object remains the same when the shape of the object changes , he will not recognize until some time later that the weight of the object also remains unchanged , even though the same operational structures are involved in the two cases . Conservation of mass is typically achieved a year or two earlier than conservation of weight . Piaget calls the phenomenon a decalage , which means literally an uncoupling ' . The existence of these displacements can not , of course , be used in argument against the stage concept , invoking criterion 4 , since it is evident that task materials themselves involve degrees of difficulty which influence the readiness with which the child will apply logical operations top52them . The fourth criterion is thus concerned with the theoretically assumed interdependence of the operations themselves . The above type of decalage is called a horizontal decalage , because it takes place within one period of development . It is thus distinguished from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two different stages . The crucial difference in a vertical decalage concerns the level of functioning : different kinds of operations are involved in the two cases . This is most clearly seen in the contrast between sensori-motor activity and the operational thinking of the older child : the two performances are on different planes , but the same system of logic can be used to describe both types of performance - ? operations on things and operations on symbols . To summarize these basic theoretical concepts . Piaget asserts that every cognitive act involves adaptation which , in turn , involves the twin processes of assimilation and accommodation . These can not occur without the existence of some form of organization or structure . The development of thinking entails an increasing differentiation and co-ordination of cognitive structures which occurs as the result of an intrinsic drive towards more and more stable forms of equilibrium . Although the equilibration process is continuous with development , certain general structures are more stable than others and these mark the stages of development . Having now stated , all too briefly , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can turn to examine Piaget 's major findings . THE RESEARCH FINDINGSPiaget describes four main stages of development : there is the sensorimotorperiod , extending from birth to about 2 years of age , the period of pre-operational thought , from 2 to 7 years , the stage of concrete operations , lasting until 11 or 12 years , and , finally , the period of formal operational thinking , developing from adolescence into adulthood . The sequence of Piaget 's research publications itself is divisible into a number of stages ( by the application of the five criteria , of course ! ) . In his earliest studies , he employed mainly verbal techniques of investigationto explore the reasoning and concepts of young children ( Piaget , 1926 , 1928 , 1932 ) . Because of this reliance upon purely verbal data , these studies are the least satisfactory of Piaget 's experiments . His subsequent longitudinal observations of the sensori-motor developmentof his own three children , however ( Piaget , 1951 , 1952a , 1954b ) , enabled him to clarify his fundamental theoretical conceptions andp53provided a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of logical thinking in children ( e.g. Piaget , 1952b ; Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 ) and in adolescents ( Inhelder and Piaget , 1958 ) . More recently , Piaget seems to have entered a fourth stage , in which his theory is given the widest possible scope and relevance , with the appearance of books on perception ( Piaget , 1969 ) , memory ( Piaget , Inhelder and Sinclair , 1968 ) , biology ( Piaget , 1967 ) , and mathematical epistemology ( Beth and Piaget , 1966 ; Piaget , 1970b ) . The Sensori-Motor Period ( 0-2 years ) The starting point of the system is that higher psychological functions grow out of biological mechanisms . Consequently , Piaget looks first at the innate mechanisms present in the newborn infant ? the reflexes . He postulates six substages in the sensori-motor period . Substage z ? the use of reflexes ( o-.r month ) . Reflexes do not function in fixed and perfectly efficient ways from birth . Piaget points out that even this innate response needs to be used in order to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first substage of a gradual accommodation to reality . Perhaps the clearest examples concern the sucking reflex , which can be seen to undergo a primitive kind of accommodationas a result of contact with the environment . For example , an infant during this stage shows some slight but definite progress in distinguishing and localizing his mother 's nipple as opposed to surroundingskin areas . But it is important to note that this improvement in performance is not brought about by a change in the action-sequence of sucking ; the scheme itself does not change ? it simply accommodates more precisely to the demands of the environment . In the same fashion , Piaget observes that more and more objects come to be subsumed under the scheme , for instance , the mother 's finger or any object he might encounter : this is generalizing assimilation . Recognitory assimilationalso occurs , for it appears that the infant soon manages to discriminateobjects that are suckable and nourishing , such as the nipple or bottle , from those that are suckable and non-nourishing , like his mother 's finger ; witness his abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to speak of a kind of adaptation occurring at this substage , both in the accommodation of schemes to reality and in the assimilation of that reality to them . But these achievements are very limited . Since schemes themselves are merely applied in an unchanging way to things , the assimilation that occurs is essentially only a utilization of the external environment to maintain the schemes in their present form . At the same time , the accommodations made result in nop54pronounced changes in the scheme which would , in turn , be reflected in subsequent assimilations . Piaget expresses this state of affairs by saying that assimilation and accommodation are as yet undifferentiated ; a progressive adaptation to reality can commence only when accommodatoryactivity is sufficiently dissociated from the assimilatory functioning of the child to permit a reciprocal relationship to exist between them . This process of differentiation begins at the next substage . Substage 2 ? the first acquired adaptations and the primary circular reaction ( 1-4 months ) . From about one month onwards the neo-natal reflexes start to alter their form as a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring his thumb to his mouth in order to suck it , this achievement is not due to innate reflexes but , rather , represents a co-ordination due to experience . The ability to suck one 's thumb is one of the first of the many interco-ordinations of schemes which develop in the sensori-motor period . Other co-ordinations which begin in this substage are between sight and hearing , between hearing and vocalization , and , most important of all for future development , between sight and grasping . Piaget calls these co-ordinations reciprocal assimilations to indicate that there is not just an association of one scheme to the other but an assimilation by each of the activity of the other . How do these interco-ordinations occur ? If we follow the development of thumb-sucking ability , a typical sequence of behaviour is observable . At first the child may suck his hand for a brief moment if it accidentally touches his mouth , but he will soon lose it . Subsequently , he is able to retain the hand for increasingly longer periods , once it is placed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands about in what appear to be deliberate attempts to effect the co-ordination . Finally , by the third or fourth month , he succeeds in bringing his thumb directly towards and into a mouth already open to receive it . Piaget uses the concept of circular reaction to refer to this type of adaptation . The sequence consists , essentially , of the infant stumbling upon a new experience as a consequence of some action , and of trying to repeat the experience by a re-enactment of the original movement . Here we see the beginnings of the differentiation of assimilation and accommodation , since coming into contact with new objects like his own thumb alters the form of the schemes . The circular reactions of this period are called primary circular reactions , in distinction to the secondary circular reactions of the third substage and tertiary circular reactions of later substages . Primary circular reactions differ from secondary circular reactions in that they are more centred on and aroundp55the infant 's body , whilst the latter are more directed towards the manipulation of surrounding objects . Substage 3 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction is by no means clear-cut , but , whereas the substage 2 infant is primarily concerned with his own bodily activities ? sucking for the sake of sucking , grasping , etc. ? the infant at this stage is more interested in the environmental consequences of actions . The secondary circular reaction is an attempt to maintain , again by a kind of rhythmic cycle , an interesting change in the environment accidentally produced . The secondary circular reaction is possible because of the co-ordinations achieved at the second substage , especially the co-ordinations of visual and manual schemes , which allow the infant to produce alterations in his environment . Thus , in the course of grasping or striking at things , he eventually notices that the rattle he grasps makes a noise or the wicker-work of his cot produces a particular tactile sensation . Through the function of reproductive assimilation the child tries to recapture the experience . Secondary circular reactions , therefore , signify the beginning of the infant 's exploration of the environment . Here is an example of Piaget 's observations of his own children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper-knife which he sees for the first time ; he looks at it a moment and then swings it while holding it in his right hand . During these movements the object happens to rub against the wicker of the bassinet : Laurent then waves his arm vigorously and obviously tries to reproduce the sound he has heard , but without understanding the necessity of contact between the paper-knife and the wicker and , consequently , without achieving this contact otherwise than by chance . At 0 ; 4 ( 3 ) same reactions , but Laurent looks at the object at the time when it happens to rub against the wicker of the bassinet . The same still occurs at o ; 4 ( 5 ) but there is a slight progress toward systematization . Finally , at o ; 4 ( 6 ) the movement becomes intentional : as soon as the child has the object in his hand he rubs it with regularity against the wicker of the bassinet . He does the same , subsequently , with his dolls and rattle ( see Obs. 102 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) As this example makes clear , secondary circular reactions generalize to assimilate new objects , so that the child reacts to the novel object by treating it in a similar way to familiar objects . It happens sometimes that the infant experiences a novel object or event which is not directlyp56manipulable by him , as , for instance , when an unfamiliar sound arouses his curiosity . What occurs in such a situation is that the infant responds by initiating some or all of his secondary circular reactions , as though he were trying to preserve the interesting event by action at a distance . When secondary circular reactions are used in this way Piaget refers to them as procedures to make interesting events last ' . Although the formation of secondary circular reactions or secondary schemes represents an advance over the preceding stage , the manner in which they function has certain limitations . Just as there is , initially , in single schemes a lack of differentiation between assimilation and accommodation , secondary circular reactions function at first in an undifferentiated way ; for instance , visual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects are incorporated more or less indiscriminately . One consequence of this fusion of object and act is that the child at this substage has no conception of objects as existing permanently in an objective system of relationships . Piaget ( 1954b ) reports a number of observations which demonstrate that infants will abandon interest in an object once it has disappeared behind a screen or cover . He argues that it is only when secondary schemes ( i.e. those which are co-ordinations of separate schemes ) become differentiated that they can be adjusted to one another ; another way of putting this is to say that , when a child discriminates between his own actions and the objects to which these actions are applied , he can observe more closely both the effects of his actions and the properties of the objects themselves . This development is a precondition for the development of the concept of the permanent object . Substage 4 ? the co-ordination of secondary schemes and their application to new situations ( 8-1l months ) . From this point onwards , schemes become differentiated and reintegrated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 interco-ordination . The most clear-cut example of the differentiation of schemes is evident in the behaviour sequence of setting aside an obstacle to reach some desired object . At substage 2 the child ignores the object if an obstacle intervenes ; later he strikes at the offending obstacle , and from this scheme of striking emerges the successful technique of pushing the object aside to gain his end . There are two distinct schemes in this pattern of behaviour ? an act of pushing aside and an act of grasping the desired object . We can thus distinguish for the first time two independent schemes which are co-ordinated with one another . The second example of such behaviour is that in which the infant tries to use objects as instruments in attaining a goal , for example , pushing an adult 's hand to make anp57object move . Again , this is a case of the child putting schemes into relationship with one another , with the result that it is possible to speak of the differentiation of means and ends . At the same time , with the differentiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects themselves . At the third substage , Piaget maintains , the novelty of an object is not of great interest to the child , who almost immediately assimilates it to habitual schemes . The substage 4 infant , on the other hand , looks at novel objects for a longer period of time and attempts to explore them . At this stage too , the child will begin to search for a desired object when it is hidden behind a screen . This is an advance over the preceding substage and signifies that the object is becoming dissociated from the child 's own activities ; but this dissociation is , as yet , only partial , since if the child at this level is allowed to find an object under screen A and the object is subsequently moved to screen B with the child watching , he will search for it where he previously found it , under A , and will not think of looking under B. Thus , it seems that the object is still not the same to the child as to the adult . Piaget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet acquired the status of a substantial thing ; it is still , in short , dependent upon the actionsequence , of which it happens to be a part . Substage S ? the tertiary circular reaction and the discovery of new means through active experimentation ( 12 ? 18 months ) . The secondary circular reactions are characterized by the fact that they involve the child taking into account the properties of external events and objects . The tertiary circular reaction develops out of the secondary ones as a more effective way of exploring the properties of new objects . There is no precise border-line between them , but , whereas the secondary reaction is the repetition of an act which led to an interesting result , the tertiary reaction is a repetition with variation . The infant varies his action apparently in order to see how this variation affects the object . Thus , having discovered the ability to drop objects from heights to observe their trajectory , the child will drop them in different ways or from different positions . A second acquisition is the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substage 4 child is only able to solve a problem requiring a differentiation of means and ends , that is , the differentiation and interco-ordination of two schemes into a totality in which one serves as the means , if the scheme which served as the means to the end was already in his repertoire . The child at the fifth substage , however , is able , through the trial-and-error behaviour of the tertiary circular reaction , to discover new means . Thus , hep58succeeds in finding a way of drawing a desired object towards him by means of the base on which it rests or perhaps by using a stick as an instrument , in the same way that Kohler 's ( 1925 ) ape was able to retrieve a banana lying outside its cage . The tertiary circular reaction must not , though , be equated with trial-and-error in the sense that Thorndike used the term : in Piaget 's theory the trials are guided by schemes which are capable of giving a meaning to fortuitous events , so that trial-and-error is essentially the process of bringing accommodatoryactivities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous substage with respect to the concept of the permanent object is overcome now : the child will search for an object at the place where he has seen it disappear . This achievement , and the characteristic limitation of this level of development , are apparent in the following observation : At 1 ; 7 ( 11 ) Jacqueline is seated on a bed. 1 . I place a pebble on my hand , put my hand under quilt A and withdraw it closed . Jacqueline opens my hand , then searches under A and finds the pebble. 2 . Same experiment under my vest B. Jacqueline opens my hand and goes under vest B at the first try . Consequently , success ensues. 3 . I place the pebble in my hand and press this hand against the other one in C , leaving the pebble there . Jacqueline searches in my first hand , then under vest B , then finally under the quilt A. She takes no account of position C , although she has watched each of my movements. 4 . I repeat the experiment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , then under quilt A , then at last under vest B , but still takes no account of my other hand . ( Piaget , 1954b , p. 76 ) From this and similar observations , Piaget concludes that the child will search and find a disappearing object only when he can actually observe all the successive displacements of the object . When an invisible displacement intervenes , the child relapses into the same difficulties which he has already overcome when visible displacements were involved . Success with invisible displacements involves the child being able to imagine or represent to himself changes in the position of the object . This comes about at the final substage of sensori-motor development . Substage 6 ? the invention of new means through mental combinations ( 18 months + ) . This stage can be summarized as follows . The child wishes to achieve some end but has no scheme which could serve asp59a means . This is similar to the substage 5 pattern , but now the child is able to solve the problem by an internal experimentation . Thus , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object is in the way of a door closing or that a ball rolled under the furniture will reappear at a certain position because he can represent the movements of these objects without having to observe them directly . The coordinationof schemes , then , is no longer confined to the realm of action , but takes place internally . Consequently , since the child can represent the object , it is finally freed from perception and action and is seen as obeying autonomous laws of displacement . With the advent of this capacity , the sensori-motor period draws to a close and subsequently intellectual development occurs in the use of symbols and the internalizationof actions . Intelligence organizes the world by organizing itself . ' Two related themes are apparent in Piaget 's work on sensori-motor development , namely , that development consists of an increasing differentiation and coordinationof assimilatory and accommodatory activities , and that these advances in internal organization parallel the organization and constructionof external reality . Initially , assimilation and accommodation are undifferentiated in the sense that there are no specialized operations of accommodation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reality . That these are two complementary aspects of behaviour is evident from the consideration that the more schemes differentiate and relate to one another through reciprocal assimilation , the more ability the child has to explore and accommodate to the properties of the external environment . Thus , because all knowledge is simultaneously accommodation to the object and assimilation to the subject , the progress of intelligence works in the dual direction of externalization and internalization , so that if ' intelligenceorganizes the world by organizing itself ' ( Piaget , 1954b , p. 355 ) , we can just as validly assert that intelligence organizes itself by organizing the world ' . In other words , no priority is accorded either to the activity of the subject or to the constraints of the environment , for the development of thinking can only be understood as a process which occurs between these two poles . It is in this sense that it may be said that adaptation to the environment and the development of organized thinking are complementary . But at the end of the sensori-motor period we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development is essentially intelligence in action , the first five substages preparing the way for the achievement of substage 6 , by which the child can solve ap60problem for the first time by internal experimentation , not by the manipulation of objects in the environment . That the child reaches the end of the sensori-motor stage does not , of course , imply that no further sensori-motor development takes place . It means only that from this point on the most advanced adaptations take place on a conceptual rather than on a sensori-motor level . The Pre-operational Stage ( 2-7 years ) The characterization of the advances made in sensori-motor developmentas reflecting the increasing differentiation and co-ordination of assimilation and accommodation provides a means of understanding how the achievement of representation both arises from sensori-motor activities and yet comes to signify a qualitatively different level of functioning . The ability to represent or evoke non-perceptible objects has its roots in the increasing differentiation of assimilation and accommodationwhich allows the child to accommodate to objects in acts of imitation . Imitation , for Piaget , is the primacy of accommodation over assimilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object . This type of behaviour is evident as early as substage 3 , in which , for example , an infant will clench and unclench his hands in imitation of an adult . But it is only at the sixth substage that the imitation becomes representative . Piaget ( 1951 ) cites the case of one of his children who , in her efforts to get at the contents of a matchbox , repeatedly opened and closed her mouth ; she was , he says , representing the enlargement she wanted in the visible opening of the box . In this example , the child imitates the behaviour of the object . What happens subsequently , Piaget believes , is that these exterior imitations on the part of the child become internalized as images , an image being a covert reproduction of an initially overt accommodation . Eventually , images cease to be just pale copies of objects and begin to serve as anticipations of events and as plans of action . This can be seen in deferred imitation , in which the child observes a certain behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , one of Piaget 's children observed a child in a fit of temper and , once inside its playpen , repeated the behaviour , in a more detached fashion , to observe its effects . In this case , an attempt is made to reproduce the observed behaviour in its entirety , or almost , but in other forms of imitation the act is only a foreshortened version of the original , overt accommodation to the properties of the object . For instance , a visual image is formed , first , through eye-movements tracing the contours of the original object , and secondly , throughp61these movements becoming reduced in range but none the less reproducingthe particular outline and preserving this as a cognitive structure . Piaget and Inhelder ( 1966 ) wish to reserve the term schema for the imitative accommodation that is focused on the outline properties of an object . If imitation is the primacy of accommodation , play is the primacy of assimilation over accommodation . Again , the roots of play can be traced back to the sensori-motor period . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way to gain an object . The execution of this scheme may arouse pleasure and the infant will re-enact it , regardless of any practical aim . Thus , what was originally an adaptive action becomes play . By the sixth substage symbolic play appears in which the child makes believe ' that an object is something else , as when one of Piaget 's children uses a cloth , and subsequently the tail of her rubber donkey , as a pillow . Both these examples show , not adaptive behaviour in the sense of an equilibrium between assimilationand accommodation , but primacy of assimilation , since objects are simply incorporated into existing schemes . Piaget ( 1951 ) makes a distinction between signifiers ' and signified ' . A signifier is something , for instance , an image or word , which symbolizes or stands for ' an object or event , whereas the signified is the event to which the signifier refers . Together , these constitute the symbolic or representative function . Now , Piaget 's views may be summarized in the statement that accommodation provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen in operation in deferred imitation , in symbolic play , and in adaptive intelligence . In the first two , there is a lack of equilibrium between assimilation and accommodation . Where imitative accommodationis the aim , there is a subordination of assimilatory schemes to the properties of the object ; in symbolic play , on the other hand , assimilation dominates accommodation , the latter merely providing images which are immediately incorporated into existing schemes . However , for behaviour to qualify as adaptive intelligence , the images formed through imitation must be synchronized and equilibrated with assimilatory schemes , just as it was necessary at the previous level to effect the co-ordination of assimilatory and accommodatory actions . The attainment of signifiers and significates at the close of the sensori-motor period means , therefore , that the child is about to embark upon a process of development , functionally similar to the one which he has just accomplished on the level of direct action ; but this new stage is qualitatively distinct from the preceding one ,  |p62since  the highest achievements of which the child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium between signifiers and significates is not immediate , since play and imitation are the two extreme forms of symbolic functioning , which are only gradually combined in genuine , adaptive intelligence . One consequence of these views on the development of representationis that language is regarded as one of the manifestations of the symbolic function . Piaget is quite willing to admit that the development of thinking is aided considerably by the development of language ( e.g. Piaget , 1951 , p. 221 ) for language makes possible the evocation of events by means of differentiated signifiers . But since language itself is an expression of the more general symbolic function , then it develops along with the symbolic function and can not , therefore , be regarded as an independent determinant of the development of thinking . As Furth ( 1968 , 1969 ) emphasized , there is a clear distinction in Piagetian psychology between symbols ( images , words , gestures ) and the actions or operations performed with these symbols , with the result that Piaget 's views are distorted if one derives operations from symbols . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internalization of actions which constitutes the basic aspect of the development of thinking , so that the child 's use of symbols , including words , is primarily determined by the extent of his progress in the development of operationalstructures . In the pre-operational period , as the name implies , the internalization of actions has not yet reached the stage in which the child can make use of a system of operations . But developments in this period can be conceived as preparing the way for this achievement through the increasing co-ordination of assimilation and accommodationin the child 's symbolic activities . In general terms , three phases can be distinguished in the developmenttowards operational thought which occurs during the preoperationalperiod : the appearance of the first verbal schemes , the use of pre-concepts ' , and the phase of pre-operational reasoning. 1 . The first verbal schemes . The first words that the child uses represent schemes of action , either related to the subject or partly objective . Thus the sound bow-wow ' may be applied , not only to dogs and similar animals , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may , similarly , be generalized to include all women and all men , or they may be used as requests or commands . Piaget says that these first verbal schemes are sensori-motor schemes in the process of becoming concepts : they are sensori-motor in that they are modes ofp63action capable of generalization , but they are the first approximations to concepts in that the use of a particular symbol implies a partial dissociation from the child 's own activity . A concept may be said to exist when a verbal label is consistently applied to the same set of objects or relations . This stability of usage is due to the fact that society defines and stabilizes the use of words , but it is absent in the child 's first use of words , for example , in the case of the child who uses the word bowwow ' to refer , within the space of a few days , to dogs , cars and men. 2 . Pre-concepts . As he grows older , of course , the child makes finer distinctions , but up to about 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pre-concepts , which Piaget characterizes as being neither truly individual nor truly general concepts . An example of a pre-concept is given in the following protocol : But also at about 2 ; 6 she used the term the slug ' for the slugs we went to see every morning along a certain road . At 2 ; 7 ( 2 ) she cried : There it is ! ' on seeing one , and when we saw another ten yards further on she said : There 's the slug again . ' I answered : But is n't it another one ? ' J. then went back to the first one . Is it the same one ? ' ? Yes ? Another slug ? ' ? Yes ? Another or the same ? ' . . . The question obviously had no meaning for J. ( Piaget , 1951 , p. 225 ) It is apparent that the child has not yet developed the idea of a class of creatures called slugs , so that she can conceptualize neither all slugs ' nor an individual slug . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual identity and of the general class concept . In fact , says Piaget , these two features are synonymous , since the absence of a general class means that the individual elements can not be assembled within it , and the lack of individualityof the parts prevents the construction of an inclusive class. 3 . Pre-operational reasoning . The child 's reasoning exhibits the same typical absence of generality . One type of reasoning Piaget calls transduction ' , which may be defined as an assimilation of the particular to the particular . For example , one child seemed to accept the argument that she could not have an orange since they were still green and not yet a nice , yellow colour , until she noticed that her camomile tea was yellow ; if the camomile is already yellow , then the oranges can also be yellow . . . and the demand was resumed . Such reasoning , Piaget maintains , is due to the child centring her attention upon one particularp64aspect of the situation and assimilating other aspects of the situation to this one . The centring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centration , to use Piaget 's term , also explains the sort of reasoning shown by the pre-operational child in many of the other problems which Piaget has devised . In his early studies on judgement and reasoning in the child ( Piaget , 1928 ) , he demonstrated that the thought of the pre-operational child is largely determined by the child 's own point of view . Thus , in one investigation , which was concerned with the child 's notion of foreigners ' , Piaget found that although Swiss children at this period of development could grasp that the French are foreigners , they would not admit that the Swiss are foreigners to the French . Another experiment investigated the child 's understanding of left ' and right ' and found that , whilst the pre-operational child can correctly identify his own right and left hand , he is unable to identify correctly the hands of someone facing him . Both studies signify that the young child is unable to place himself at the point of view of others and it is in this sense that Piaget describes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-verbal methods , for example , by having the child draw the perspectives of observers at various points around a three-dimensional model ( Piaget and Inhelder , 1956 ) . Another well-known series of experiments concerned the child 's understanding of the relationship of the parts to the whole in grouping ( Piaget , 1952b ) . For example , the child may be asked to draw three tulips ; having done this he is encouraged to draw a larger number of some other flower , say , daisies , so that he may finish with three tulips and five daisies . It is found that the pre-operational child is quite willing to agree that both tulips and daisies are flowers , but when asked : Are there more flowers or more daisies ? ' , he replies that there are more daisies . Here we have a failure to understand the relation of parts to the whole which contains them and the child 's failure may be interpreted , once again , as due to his centring upon one element in the situation ( more daisies ) and assimilating others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , in the experiments on different kinds of conservation . This is the term used to refer to the recognition that certain properties of a display are invariant despite changes in other properties in the display . The recognition that objects have an autonomous existence independent of the subject , which occurs at the sixth substage of the sensori-motor period , representsthe first major conservation . But , for Piaget , this is only a necessary first step in the construction of reality . Having learned to endow thep65object with a permanent existence , the child must learn to recognize the invariance of its other attributes . The now classic experiment with different shaped beakers illustrates the conservation of quantity . The child is given two glasses of equal dimensions ( AI and A2 ) , which contain the same quantity of liquid . He is asked whether there is the same amount of liquid in each . Then , the liquid in A2 is poured into two small glasses of equal dimensions ( Bi and B2 ) and the subject is asked whether the quantity of liquid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which thus operates as a standard . If the child believes that there is the same amount , the experiment may be taken a step further , Bi being poured into two smaller containers ( Cl and C2 ) and B2 into C3 and C4 . He is then asked about the equality or inequality of the liquid in the four very small glasses as compared with that in the standard , Figure i . Conservation of quantityAI . The pre-operational child will merely point to the level of the liquid in Bi and B2 and assert that there is less liquid in them because the level is lower , or , alternatively , he may observe that the width of Bi and B2 combined is greater than that of At and conclude that there is more liquid in Bi and B2 . At a later age the pre-operational child will say that there is the same amount for this comparison , but , when the discrepancies become large , as with the C glasses , he will revert to non-conservation . In brief , the child at this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other . Similarly , experiments testing conservation of weight require the child to relate together the variations along two dimensions . In such an experiment the child may begin with two identical balls of clay which he sees to be of equal weight by testing them on a balance . Next , the experimenter elongates one of the balls and asks the child to say whether it will now still weigh the same as the other . The pre-operational child does not grasp the invariance of weight during transformations in the shape of an object , since his centration upon one dimension ( width or length ) induces him to believe that the weight of the object will have changed . All the major limitations of pre-operational thinking ? the misunderstandingof the relationship between parts and the whole which contains them , egocentric thought , and the lack of conservation ofp66quantity and weight ? arise from centration upon one aspect of the total situation and , in this sense , it may be said that the child 's thinking is dominated by his perception . In the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signifiers provided by accommodation are still in the form of images and are not therefore completely general , whilst assimilation , which provides the signified , is irreversible since objects are simply incorporated into the scheme which constitutes the initial centre of interest . Hence , assimilation is distorting , accommodation inadequate , and there is no equilibrium between the two . Progress within the stage , as in others , can be viewed as a trend towards greater equilibrium . Piaget ( 195 ' 7 ) has proposed that this equilibration process can be conceptualized in probabilistic terms and has applied this model to the attainment of conservation . According to Piaget , centration upon one dimension makes it increasingly probable ( presumably through satiation and contrast ) that the subject will subsequently centre upon the other dimension ; this , in turn , is likely to lead to a phase in which the subject alternates between the two dimensions and this alternation becomes more rapid , thus increasing the probability that the subject will encompassboth aspects in a single cognitive act . When the child reaches this level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dimension can be balanced against changes in the other , and accommodation has become generalized and no longer restricted to particular images , since reversible operations permit the use of symbols which are independent of particular stimulus configurations . No mention has yet been made of the influence of social factors , but these are important in Piaget 's theory for two main reasons . In the first place , it is through social interaction that the child acquires linguistic symbols , which are general and not related to specific stimulus displays ; the image , of necessity , remains individual and incapable of being communicated , whereas the fact that the conventionalsigns of language are derived from social co-operation ensures their generality and communicability . Secondly , through social interaction the child is confronted with points of view other than his own ; his egocentrism diminishes through repeated encounters with opposing views and he learns , in G. H. Mead 's phrase , to take the role of the other ' ( Mead , 1934 ) . Flavell ( 1968 ) has extended the MeadPiagetthesis in his studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inferred that Piaget believes socialization to be the prime cause of the development of rational thinking . He has stated quite explicitly ( Piaget , 1951 , p. 239 ) that operational thinking andp67socialization must be regarded as interdependent . A system of operationscannot , of course , be general unless there is agreement about the names that can be used to refer to the operations within the system , but this generality does not derive solely from the linguistic conventions established through social interaction , since the operations themselves develop from the internalization of actions and are not therefore reducibleto social conventions . This is a basic point in the understanding of Piaget 's theory : that which is given ' , whether it is the physical environment , social structure and relationships or linguistic conventions , does not cause the development of the individual ; it exists to be utilized by the individual . The success of this utilization will depend upon the extent to which the person has developed structures capable of dealing with social and linguistic factors as well as upon the characteristics of those factors themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and that which is given to the individual , a dynamic interdependence which makes it inappropriate to talk of independent cause and effect . The Period of Concrete Operations ( 7-11 years ) The developments of the pre-operational period culminate at about the age of 7 in a method of thinking characterized by decentration and reversibility . The child at this age knows that there are more flowers than daisies , because he recognizes that daisies and tulips are subclasses of flowers ; he appreciates that he is a foreigner to a person of another nationality , since he is able to place himself at the point of view of the other ; and eventually he insists upon the invariance of quantity and weight in the face of perceptual transformations , because his thought has become flexible enough to identify and coordinatethe dimensional changes involved . The appearance of these and similar achievements at approximately the same time signifies that a new level of intellectual development has been reached . Piaget contends that these performances mark the beginning of a stage since the intellectual operations which make these achievements possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , that this system can be described by the use of an abstract , logical model , in which the relationships between logical operations are derived deductively . He assumes that there is a close correspondence between the deductive system and the actual cognitive structures of the concrete operational child and , accordingly , that the former describes the latter . At the same time , he recognizes this as an assumption and demands that future empirical studies determine whether the **27;2624;TOOLONG in a deductive system correspond to those that exist in reality . In order to understand this logical model , it is necessary to understand the meaning of certain distinctions which Piaget makes . Let us first note the distinction between the logic of classes and the logic of relations . To carry out the operation of classifying means to designate certain elements as classes which can then be combined in various ways . For example , we consider spaniels and fox terriers to be elements in the class of dogs , cats and dogs to be part of the broader class of animals , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchicallyarranged so that a class can both include and be included in others . Although classification may be described as one technique of relating elements , Piaget follows the tradition of distinguishing it from the logic of relations , of which he identifies two major divisions , symmetrical and asymmetrical relations . In a symmetrical relationship A has the same relationship to B that B has to A. A favourite example is that of brothers : if A is B 's brother , then B is A 's brother . In an asymmetrical relationship , however , this is not the case ; it is not applicable , for instance , to such asymmetrical relations as A is taller than B , or C is prettier than D , etc . A further distinction that Piaget makes is between logical groups and what he calls logical groupings ' . Remember that his intention is to characterize cognitive structures by means of logical models and that these structures represent different levels of equilibrium . For a system to be in equilibrium it must contain the means of compensating for changes that threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the existence of reversible operations . Now this state of affairs in a physical-psychological system corresponds closely to the properties of mathematical groups , which have the essential characteristic that the laws of operation , by which the elements in the group are combined , are such as to allow the system to remain stable during its operation . Piaget ( 1949 ) gives as an example of a group the system of positive and negative numbers characterized by the operation +n ( i.e. addition of an integer ) . This constitutes a group because it obeys four conditions : I. Combinativity . Two operations of the system , when combined , result in a new operation , e.g. + 1+1 = + 2. 2 . Inversion . Every operation of the system can be annulled by an inverse operation , e.g. +2 ? 2 = o. 3 . Identity . There exists a single identity operator , defined as the operation , which , when applied to any assertion , leaves it unchanged . With this group , the identity operator is the resultant of any operation and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I = o , and 1 ? o = 1.  |p694  . Associativity . The operations are associative and thus the product is the same with different orders of combinations . Thus , ( 4+2 ) -3 = 4+ ( 2-3 ) . The group is in equilibrium because any element may be combined with any other and because each operation , which produces a change in the system , is capable of being reversed by its inverse operation . It is thus a closed and stable system . A grouping ' is the name that Piaget gives to logical systems which have certain of the properties of groups but which do not form groups as such . For example , Piaget maintains that the logic of classes and of relations together form eight groupings in the period of concrete operations and that both these logics show some of the properties of a group . They show combinativity , for two classes may be combined to form a comprehensive class which embraces them both ( all boys and all girls = all children ) and two asymmetrical relations ( A is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be joined into one relation which contains them ( A is taller than C ) . Reversibility exists also ; when reversibility is applied to classes it is called negation and it is called reciprocity when applied to relations . Thus , the operation of classifying can be reversed by an opposite operation which cancels it , e.g. all children except boys = all girls , as can asymmetrical seriation , e.g. A is taller than B becomes B is smaller than A. However , the operations that constitute classification and seriation do not form a group , since only certain elements may be combined : the elements false teeth ' and children ' are not in the normal course of events capable of being subsumed under a comprehensive category which contains both of them , nor can one meaningfully relate A is taller than B ' to C is prettier than D ' . The distinguishing feature of groupings is , therefore , that they derive their form from various types of concrete situations and are thus relative to those situations . Piaget calls them concrete operations to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is successful only in so far as it is concerned with a particular concrete situation and that logical operations in this period are still not independentof concrete content . One consequence of the concreteness of early operational reasoning is that the stage is characterized by a number of horizontal decalages . Conservation of quantity , for instance , is attained some two years before conservation of weight , although the same logical operations are involved . This is due , Piaget thinks , to the concrete operational child having to observe the results of his operations in different concrete situations , and to his inability to detach his thinking sufficiently from concrete reality so as to achieve a structuring which would be capable of embracing its different aspects.  |p70As  examples of the concrete operational groupings we may take that dealing with the primary addition of classes and that dealing with the addition of asymmetrical relations . The first describes the organization among classes , where each one is included in the next larger one . A number of examples of such classification have already been given : cats and dogs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tulips are subclasses of the class of flowers . This grouping , then , describes the operational performance of the child who is able to solve problems based upon the inclusion of parts in a whole . Similarly , the grouping of the addition of asymmetrical relations describes the performance of the child when solving problems of serial ordering , for instance , arranging a number of sticks in order of size and inserting others between them . Other groupings refer to more difficult tasks ; for example , one grouping describes the kinds of relationships that can exist when objects are ordered asymmetrically along two dimensions at the same time , for instance , width and height . This kind of ordering can be represented by a matrix , in which objects are arranged according to their place on one dimension from left to right and by their place on the other from top to bottom . Piaget maintains that the child must understand the ways in which two asymmetrical series combine in order to grasp the conservation problem : the understanding of these logical relationships enables the child to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also narrower , etc . Thus , just as the behaviour of the sensori-motor child showed an increasing independence from the here-and-now ' ? from perception and the immediate consequences of actions ? so the transition from pre-operational to concrete-operational thinking represents an increasingindependence of thought from perception . Thought , as behaviour , becomes more intelligent the more it detaches itself ' from immediate stimulation and it accomplishes this by becoming operational . But if concrete operations have succeeded in taking this progressive liberation a step further , they are not the end-point of intellectual development . The achievements characteristic of concrete operations involve the manipulation of things . It is because of this that they are called concrete ' : their starting-point is always the real and the given , rather than the potential . When the child has to operate with relationshipswhich are not directly given to him in perception , he is unable to follow through his reasoning to its logical outcome . He can not , therefore , solve a simple problem , such as : Edith is fairer than Susan ; Edith is darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' The solution of problems like this depends upon the emergence of a new orientation to reality which occurs with the onset of adolescence.  |p71The  Period of Formal Operations ( from about 12 years ) This reorientation to reality constitutes the major advance of formal over concrete thinking . It has three major characteristics : I. When the child begins to think in terms of possibilities and to determine what is ' in the context of what might be ' , we can say that his thought is hypothetico-deductive in character . This means that the child can regard the various possibilities in a given situation as a number of hypotheses which may be confirmed or not. 2 . Formal thinking is propositional thinking . The concrete operational child succeeds in classifying and relating objects and events ; the adolescent can do this , but he can also take the results of these concrete operations , cast them into the form of propositions , and then proceed to operate upon them by various kinds of logical connections . Formal operations are , therefore , operations performed upon the results of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the test of considering as many possibilities as he can , the adolescent must isolate systematically all the individual variables together with all the possible combinations of these variables . In other words , he submits the problem to a combinatorialanalysis . An experiment which demonstrates these properties of adolescent thought and serves as an introduction to the logical model used by Piaget to describe this thinking is one reported by Inhelder and Piaget ( 1958 ) on the problems raised in the oscillation of a pendulum . This experiment used a simple apparatus , which consisted of a string , which could be shortened or lengthened , and a set of varying weights . The subject 's task is to explain what determines the frequency of the oscillations of a weight suspended by the string from a pole . The variables which one might think to be relevant are : the length of the string , the weight of the object , the height of the dropping point , and the force of the push given by the subject . Only the first of these variables is actually relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other three and to exclude them . The results are easily summarized . The pre-operational child tends to believe that the impetus he gives to the suspended weight is the real cause of the variations in the frequency of the oscillations , but he is incapable of giving a consistent explanation : at one moment he refers to the amount of impetus , at the next to the weight , and so on . The concrete operational child , on the other hand , is able to order the lengths , elevations , etc. , serially and to judge the differences betweenp72the observed frequencies of oscillation . He can , then , observe that the shorter the string the greater the frequency of oscillation . But he is incapable of isolating this variable from the others and , consequently , does not arrive at the correct conclusion . This is finally achieved in the formal operational period : EGG ( 15 ; 9 ) at first believes that each of the four factors is influential . She studies different weights with the same string length and doesnot notice any appreciable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she varies the length of the string with the same 200 gramweight and finds that when the string is small , the swing is faster ' . Finally , she varies the dropping point and the impetus ( successively ) with the same medium length string and the same 200 gram weight , concluding for each one of these two factors : Nothing has changed ' . ( Inhelder and Piaget , 1958 , pp. 75-6 ) There is , Piaget believes , a complex reasoning process behind these simple statements which can be described in the language of propositional logic . This involves the substitution of symbols for the propositions appearing in an argument and the elaboration of a number of rules , also symbolized , that are used as operators on the propositional symbols . In the present case , for example , p can refer to the statement that there is a variation in the length of the string , q to the statement of variation in weight , and r and s to modifications in the height of drop and the impetus . Finally x is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result , i.e. the frequency of oscillations . The basic operations are implication ( D ) : p q signifies that if p occurs then q does also ; disjunction ( v ) : p v q means either p or q ; the negation of a proposition is indicated by a bar over the symbol for the proposition : thus , not p = p ; lastly , conjunction takes the form p . q ( p and q ) . Applying this notation to the pendulum problem , we can describe the successive stages in the solution of the problem . For example : 1 . When , initially , a subject believes that each of the four variables is influential , he is asserting : pvqvrvsx or p.q.r.s.x. 2 . Next , one variable , say weight , is excluded by the subject using different weights with the same length of string and the same weight with varying lengths of string . He finds out by this experimentation that the modification of the length corresponds , with or without modification of the weight , to a modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the absence of changes inp73frequency . This amounts to stating the truth of the following com-binations : ( p. q ? x ) v(p.4.x)v ( p. q. ) v ( p.4 ? x ) 3 . The reasoning process is the same for the exclusion of height of drop . But , to exclude this third variable , the subject must take the previous two , length of string and weight , into account , and consequently the successful exclusion of two variables from three involves eight true combinations : ( p.q.r.x ) v ( p. q.r.x ) v ( p.4.r.x ) v ( p.4.F.x ) v ( p. q.r.x ) ( p.q.P.x ) v(p.4.r.x)v(p.4.P.x)4 . Finally , when the subject isolates the variable of impetus , he takes into account the other three variables . There are , then , sixteen true combinations : ( p.q.r.s.x ) v ( p.q.r .. x ) **25;2653;TOOLONG ( p.4.r.s.x ) **25;2680;TOOLONG ( p.q.r.s.x ) v ( p.q.r .. x ) v(p.q.F.s.x)v ( p.q.F .. ) 7 ) v ( p.4.r.s.x ) v ( p.4.r.g.x ) v ( p.4.P.s .. 17 ) v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , presupposes the understanding of a complicated combinatorial system and the ability to think in a hypothetico-deductive manner . Piaget admits that this understanding may not be fully articulate , so that subjects might reason explicitly with some combinations and have only an ' approximateidea ' of the others . But the essential point is that the subject 's performance entails a cognitive structure describable in terms of propositionallogic . In addition to operations such as disjunction and implication , there are four , more general transformations , whose function is to transform particular operators into others . The four transformations are inversion or negation ( N ) , reciprocity ( R ) , identity ( I ) and correlativity ( C ) . The first three of these terms have already been defined with reference to concrete operations ; in the period of formal thinking , the three operationsare applied to other operations . Thus , in negation the operator , p v q is transformed into .4 ( i.e. the negation of p or q is neither p nor q ) ; the reciprocal of p v q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator unchanged , so that p v q remains p v q . The correlate of an expression is defined by replacing the disjunctive with the conjunctive sign , or vice versa ; thus the correlate of p v q is p . q , and the correlate of p v4 is 13.4 . These four transformations together form a group , fulfilling the four criteria for groups ? combinativity , inversion , identity and associativity . Any transformation can be combined with any other and whatever sequence of transformations is performed , thep74final result is always equivalent to one of them . For instance , NRC = I becauseN ( pvq ) =1 ) .4and R ( p.4 ) = p.qand C ( p.q ) = pvqbut I ( p v q ) = p v qhence NRC = IThe structure constituted by these transformations thus forms an equilibrated system . Piaget believes the structure to be of psychological importance , since it enables the subject to co-ordinate operations . When the subject can do this , his thinking is at once flexible and stable . But Piaget believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems ; he believes it shapes the adolescent 's whole way of looking at life . Logic , he affirms , is not isolated from life , because logic is no more than the expression of the operational co-ordinations essential to action . It is not difficult to see how the adolescent 's ability to think of possibilities implies a new orientation to life . The adolescent becomes capable of living in the future as well as in the present . Reality is no longer accepted , for there are now various alternatives to choose between . In the early stages of using this newly acquired ability , the adolescent goes through a phase of egocentrism , in the sense that his hypothetical thinking typically shows a lack of differentiation between private desires and fantasies on the one hand and general theories on the other . The major factors which make adolescents accommodate to reality eventually are social interaction and having to settle down to do a job.  |p75ORDER  AND VARIABILITY IN THOUGHTIn discussing the relationship between logic and psychology , it was concluded that Piaget 's operationalism overcame the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an assessment of the theory must await evidence and discussion on a number of outstanding issues . Having examined the theory more closely , we are now in a position to pursue these issues . The first has to do with the orderliness of intellectual development : is there an inevitable order in the sequence of successive achievements , as Piaget 's theory holds , or do we find variationsin this development among individuals belonging to similar social or cultural groups ? Assessment of this aspect of the theory entails an examination of the sequence of development both over the entire range of stages and within each stage . The second issue concerns the influence of social and cultural factors on thinking : on Piaget 's theory , logical rules are universal since they are formed by abstraction from actions common to all men ; this suggests that there will be a common core to the thinking of men from widely different cultural backgrounds ; but , against this , it may be argued that such backgrounds are likely to foster radically different modes of thought . Which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third point at issue : Piaget 's theory appears to make language subsidiary to operationaldevelopment . For instance , the development of the concept of conservation is attributed to the operations of reversibility and compensationrather than to the development of a linguistic ability independent of operational development . Does research on the attainment of conservation enable us to assess the influence of these factors ? Finally , there is the general , theoretical issue of whether the adaptation-equilibration model is an adequate or even a permissible one . In what sense can we say that equilibration explains ' thep76simultaneous development of adaptation to the environment and of thinking ? Is this a principle applicable to actual cases , or is there here , as Husserl intimated , a confusion of an ideal principle with actual cases ? These issues are by no means separate for they are particular expressionsof a yet more general dichotomy of opinion . The whole impetus of Piagetian theory is towards accounting for the existence of rational thought . The major constructs are essentially descriptive of the organized nature of thinking at each stage and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system from one stage to the next . However , this view is adequate only if the assumption is correct that those factors that might produce diversity of types of thinking at each stage or variability in the sequence of attainment ? social norms and linguistic usages , for example ? are either subsidiary to or isomorphic with the development of operational structures guided by the equilibration process . The existence of this basic assumption was emphasized in the previous chapter . But if it can be demonstrated that these factors are independent of operational development to the extent that they produce variability not predictable from a knowledge of operational level alone , then it may be concluded that this points to a limitation inherent in the theory . This demonstration would imply , not , of course , that the theory is totally invalid , but that there are events which lie outside its frame of reference . The general purpose of a review of the experimental evidence for Piaget 's theory must , then , be to consider the truth of this criticism . STAGES IN DEVELOPMENTThe theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the sequence of attainments is logically , and hence psychologically , invariant , and there are certain levels of development which mark the formation of co-ordinated systems of schemes , first of actions and later of operations . The hypothesis of invariant sequences may be tested by observing whether children at given levels are able to perform satisfactorily on tests which relate theoretically to earlier levels ; Guttman 's ( 1944 ) scalogram analysis fulfils this function . The hypothesisof co-ordinated schemes is testable by reference to the intercorrelationsbetween theoretically related tests . Further , given these hypotheses and the theory as a whole , it follows that the relationship between stages and chronological age will also be fairly constant , at least in Western cultures.  |p77Sensori-Motor  DevelopmentThe evidence for these notions is not equally extensive for all phases of development . The sensori-motor period , for example , remains relatively unexplored . Woodward ( 1959 ) tested the sequential nature of developmentin this period by studying a group of severely mentally defective children , whose chronological ages ranged from 7 to 16 years . She found that the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of subjects capable of performing them , corresponded to Piaget 's description and that , if a subject could perform at a given level , he could , in general , perform at the earlier levels . Woodward also found a correlation between general developmental level and degree of attainment of the object concept . This has been verified by Charlesworth ( 1966 ) , who found that the active search for a hidden object , as well as other modes of behaviour typical of the fourth substage , appears at 8 months of age , as predicted by Piaget . A necessary qualification to these findings , however , is that the development of the object concept does not proceed at the same rate for all objects . Decarie ( 1965 ) and Bell ( 1970 ) report that the mother tends to be responded to in this way before other objects , although 27 per cent of the infants in Bell 's study showed the concept of object permanence before that of person permanence : these infants differed from the majority in showing little interest in proximity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decalage ' is not inconsistent with Piagetian theory , but it must be observed that , in order to account for the nature of the decalages ' that do occur , we require knowledge of the subject 's experience and of the stimulus situation . Now , although the adaptation model allows for the influence of these factors , it does not treat them systematically . Bower ( 1967 ) has commented that Piaget 's presentation makes no mention of the stimulus aspects of his test situations . Bower 's demonstration that the week-old baby recognizes ' objects when they reappear from behind a screen , as evidenced by changes in sucking responses , has been criticized by Piaget ( 1968a ) on the grounds that these results do not signify that the infant believes that the object continues to exist behind the screen since this presupposes an organization of space and a substantiation of reality . Bower 's ( 1971 ) other experiments , in which infants were presented with the optical illusion of several images of mother , are perhaps more truly indicative of the stage of development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5 months that infants reacted with concern at this illusion . These experiments raise the general question of the relationshipp78between specific experiences and the development of the object concept . The same issue emerges from White 's ( 1969 ) observations on the co-ordination of sensori-motor schemes . Piaget 's general position that development in the first few months is from sequential activation of isolated schemes to their reciprocal co-ordination is supported , but White finds a great many more schemes than Piaget reported and , furthermore , that their development is related to the infant 's experiences of being handled . Pre-operational and Concrete Operational DevelopmentValidation of development within the pre-operational and concrete operational periods has been much more thorough and systematic . Studies by Lovell ( 1959a , b ) , Lovell and Ogilvie ( 196o , 1961a , b ) , Lovell and Slater ( 196o ) , Lovell , Healey and Rowland ( 1962 ) , Lovell , Kellett and Moorhouse ( 1962 ) , Lovell , Mitchell and Everett ( 1962 ) , Elkind ( 1961a , b , c , d , 1962 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 , 1962 ) and Hood ( 1962 ) lend strong support to the major features of Piaget 's system , namely ( a ) that qualitatively different modes of response are associated with different age levels to the extent that it is reasonable to talk of pre-operational or concrete operational thinking ; ( b ) that development on the developmental tasks is related to age , so that one can talk of a general sequence of development ; ( c ) that the ages stated by Piaget for the various achievements are , by and large , representative . These conclusions apply to the different conservations ? of quantity ( Lovell , 1959a ; Elkind , 1961a ) , weight ( Lovell and Ogilvie , 1961a , Elkind , 1961b ) and volume ( Lovell and Ogilvie , 1961b ) ? and to other concepts such as number ( Dodwell , 196o , 1961 ; Hood , 1962 ; Beard , 1963 ) and classification ( Elkind , 1961c ) . However , a more stringent assessment of the theory requires a closer scrutiny of each of these three conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that general modes of responding ' be established or that there should be a general ' sequence of development ; rather , there ought to be evidence of coordinatedoperational schemes ? the structures d'ensembles ' ? and of invariant sequences. ( a ) Although pre-operational and concrete operational modes are discriminable , a typical conclusion of the validation studies is that there is more variability across logically identical or related tasks than would be predicted from Piaget 's writings . For example , Lovell and Ogilvie ( 1961a ) point out that , whilst they obtained results very similar to those of Piaget , it is also evident that children who are conservers of weightp79on one test are non-conservers on another . Similarly , both Beard ( 1961 ) and Dodwell ( 1960 ) noted that , although older children gave more concrete operational responses than younger children , a child 's type of response varied from one situation to another . Among other investigators who have reported this sort of variation are Mannix ( 1960 ) , Feigenbaum ( 1963 ) and Uzgiris ( 1964 ) . Research demonstrates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which purportedly measure the same concept , but also that the relationship between theoretically related concepts is not as predictable as Piaget would have us believe . Dodwell ( 1962 ) , for instance , could not confirm the predicted relationshipbetween the child 's understanding of number and his understanding of classification : he found that the two kinds of concept develop within the same age range but that there is no clear relationship between them , either in the sense that one is prior to the other or that they develop concomitantly . Or again , Lovell ( 1961 ) found , contrary to Piaget , that a high proportion of children who were non-conservers of weight understood transitivity of weight . It is apparent , therefore , that equivalent levels of performance do not follow from the simple fact that tasks have the same logical structure or are related logically . But perhaps Piaget 's theory is ambiguous on this point . On the one hand , the notion of structures d'ensembles ' suggests that there ought to be striking relationships between certain concepts ; on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , therefore , to the possibility of variations in performance due to the history of the subject 's experiences and to the relative difficulty of the tasks . One means of resolving this apparent contradiction is to argue that there will be considerable variations in performance during the transition or formative phases of a stage but that , thereafter , there will be increasing evidence of integrated schemes . This reasoning has been advanced by Pinard and Laurendeau ( 1969 ) and by Flavell and Wohlwill(1969). ( b ) The second , testable criterion for the existence of stages is that there should be a constant order of succession of attainments . This criterion requires evidence beyond that showing significant relations between tasks and age . It may be tested by longitudinal assessment of subjects but the most frequently used method is scalogram analysis ( Guttman , 1944 , 1950 ; Green , 1956 ) . This technique assesses how closely each individual 's attainment of concepts corresponds with the order of attainment of the group as a whole . If , say , each subject in a group attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bep80said to form a perfectly reproducible scale , although , of course , in psychological research we must be satisfied with something less than this . Wallace ( 1965 ) provides a critical review of the studies using this technique . The available evidence is somewhat contradictory . On the one hand , Dodwell ( 196o , 1961 ) , Smedslund ( 1964 ) , Kofsky ( 1966 ) and Goldschmid and Bentler ( 1968 ) report considerable variation in the sequence by which subjects master Piagetian tasks . On the other hand , Laurendeau and Pinard ( 1962 ) were able largely to confirm the progression identified by Piaget , and both Siegelman and Block ( 1969 ) and Zern ( 1969 ) reanalysedSmedslund 's ( 1964 ) data to find significant indices of reproducibility . Moreover , Siegelman and Block report that the item order is consistent with Piaget 's theory , in that conservation of discontinuous quantity precedes conservation of continuous quantity , transitivity of discontinuous quantity precedes transitivity of length , and class-inclusion precedes multiplication of relations . Schwartz and Scholnick ( 1970 ) carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks assessing conservation of discontinuous quantity were varied systematically ; they discovered that the tasks formed a Guttman scale . A study by Freyberg ( 1966 ) is of special interest since the author concerned himself with the criterion of an invariant sequence and with the criterion of intercorrelation between logically related tests . He administered a battery of Piagetian tests to a sample of children , ranging in age from 6 to 8 years , at three-month intervals for two years . Freyberg found that twelve out of the eighteen concepts formed a significantly reproducible scale , but analysis of the longitudinal data for each child revealed a steady and gradual progression rather than a sudden acceleration to a higher level . He concluded that the hypothesis of an invariant sequence may be correct , but that it is not possible to identify a new stage of development at about the age of 7 . It may be , however , that Freyberg 's tests , which were administered in booklet form to groups of subjects , were too global in nature . In this connection , the study by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1969 ) , demonstrates the desirability of assessing scalability against different age levels and different types of response . Nassefat assessed scalability separately for each age level and for each of three item categories ( concrete , intermediate and formal ) . In general , consistency was found to be highest at the age level at which the discriminative power of each item category is maximal , that is , at age 9 for the concrete operational items , at age 11 for the intermediate items and at age 12 for the formal operational items.  |p81In  the assessment of the second criterion , as in the assessment of the first , it is necessary to distinguish phases of transition and phases of consolidation . On balance , research carried out to date suggests that the search for invariant sequences is not without foundation . Future work must , however , be sensitive to the existence of transitional phases ; the optimal strategy would seem to be the longitudinal one. ( c ) Although the validation studies confirmed the age at which the child can perform concrete operational tasks as between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time been a body of opinion which claims that Piaget tends to underestimate the capabilities of the child , largely , it is thought , because of an excessive reliance upon verbal methods of assessment . The early work on reasoning in the child ( Piaget , 1926 , 1928 ) was criticized by a number of workers . Isaacs ( 1930 ) presented examples of logical thinking in very young children and McCarthy 's ( 1954 ) review of research into childhood egocentrism yielded the conclusion that pre-operational children were much more socialized in their speech than Piaget allowed . Piaget ( 1962 ) has since admitted that these early studies relied too much upon verbal exchanges between subject and experimenter and he maintains that the subsequent , more behavioural studies demonstrate the theoretical argument more effectively . However , there are those who believe that these later studies do not escape the censure directed at the earlier ones . Berko and Brown ( 1960 ) , with specific reference to conservation , suggest that the child may equate the words more ' and less ' with dimensions of height or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a lack of verbal sophistication . Braine ( 1964 ) and Braine and Shanks ( 1965 ) also suggest that younger children use and respond to words like big ' , more ' and same ' in terms of phenomenal size rather than actual quantity . A number of studies have demonstrated these verbal difficulties . Griffiths , Schantz and Sigel ( 1967 ) found that children had most difficulty in using the term same ' correctly . Lumsden and Poteat ( 1968 ) reported that young children tend to interpret bigger ' in experiments on size conservation in terms of the vertical dimension and Lumsden and Kling ( 1969 ) found that training directed towards teaching the child a multidimensionalconcept of bigger produced significant gains in conservationbehaviour . Nummedal and Murray ( 1969 ) found that subjects who can make correct denotative discriminations perform significantly better on conservation of weight problems than subjects who are unable to discriminate connotative from denotative meaning . One implication of these studies is that the child may have an understandingp82of conservation prior to his being able to express that understanding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservationtests , as far as this is possible , we should find an earlier age of attainment than that reported by Piaget . Cohen ( 1967 ) tested this reasoning in an experiment in which size ' words like more ' and bigger ' were omitted from the instructions and from the responses , the child being asked to perform a task bringing about a new state of affairs rather than passing judgement on an existing state of affairs . Cohen found that conservation of quantity could be elicited by these means in children as young as 42 years . Also pertinent is the study by Goldschmid and Bentler ( 1968 ) which utilized both behavioural and verbal criteria for the measurement of conservation : it was found that the two sets of scores were significantly correlated , but that , in general , all the behaviour items were easier than the easiest verbal explanation item . The two indices , therefore , reflect different levels of understandingof the same concept . This research does suggest that the age at which the child attains conservation is partly dependent upon the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it can not be suggested that the results of these experiments contradict Piagetian theory . The findings that children experience difficulty with certain words and that their understanding of conservation is expressible through behaviour prior to its verbal expression are compatible with the view that the linguistic difficulties of the young child reflect his inability to handle operations , but once conservation has been achieved through the development of these operations , the correct verbalization will appear , given a facilitating environment . It can not be decided , on the basis of these results , whether language plays a part in the formation of operations or whether it merely provides the expression of an understanding already attained . One might argue that the demonstration of the priority of a behavioural to a linguistic solution of the conservationproblem implies that the latter is secondary , but this raises the question of whether the child who understands in his behaviour ' has the same concept as the child who expresses his understanding linguistically . We must return to this problem in a while . Further instances of the influence of methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concepts are attained are the controversiesover the presence of conservation in very young children and over the occurrence of transitivity judgements . Mehler and Bever ( 1967 ) claimed to have discovered conservation in children as young as 22 years . However , the upshot of the resulting controversy ( Beilin , 1968a , b ;  |p83Bever  , Mehler and Epstein , 1968 ; Piaget , 1968a ; Mehler and Bever , 1968 ) seems to be that the behaviour observed by Mehler and Bever did not signify a genuine understanding of conservation but , rather , a judgement of stimulus arrays in terms of their topological characteristics , in particular , the extent to which elements are heaped together ' . Similarly , the controversy , in which Braine ( 1959 , 1964 ) contested that the child understands transitivity at 5 years of age , while Smedslund ( 1963a , 1965 ) confirmed Piaget 's finding ( Piaget , Inhelder and Szeminska , 1960 ) of attainment at about the age of 7 , appears to have been resolved in favour of the latter by the experiments of Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 ) . These authors were able to eliminate non-transitive but outwardly correct solutions to transitivity problems , such solutions giving a misleading impression of the ability of the younger child . Briefly , a typical transitivity problem requires the subject to make judgements about three sticks ; if , in comparing stick A with stick B , the subject responds that A is longer ' and , in comparing B with C , says that B is longer ' , when asked to compare A and C ( the transitivity problem ) , he may respond correctly because of the two only A has been labelled as longer ' . Formal Operational DevelopmentPiaget 's description of the development of formal thinking has been validated by a small number of studies but the applicability of his logical model has been questioned . Lovell ( 1961 ) examined 200 subjects , mostly adolescents , on experiments similar to those carried out by Piaget and Inhelder ( 1958 ) , for example , the problems of the oscillation of a pendulum and the combination of colourless liquids . The different tests were found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the development of logical thinking proposed by Piaget and Inhelder were confirmed . Studies by Lodwick ( 1959 ) and Case and Collinson ( 1962 ) , which classified children 's responses to questions about various prose passages for intuitive , concrete and formal modes of thinking , supported the general nature of Piaget 's formulation , although Stone and Ausubel ( 1969 ) found that the ability to comprehend such material developed selectively in each subject-field rather than , as Piaget implies , synchronously , in all fields ' . Neimark 's ( 1970 ) results were , however , consistent with the view that formal operational tasks are correlated , and Elkind ( 1967b ) confirmed the emergence of a new form of egocentrism at this level . Shapiro and O'Brien ( 1970 ) were able to show that children below the age of 11 do not reason in a **26;2707;TOOLONG , and , likewise , Lunzer ( 1960 ) confirmed Piaget'sp84main findings on the development of the child 's understanding of volume , finding that a proper understanding of this concept does not occur until about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that the conservation of displacement volume and the ability to multiply three linear dimensions to calculate volume depend upon notions of infinity and continuity was not supported by Lunzer 's study . Lunzer 's comment that Piaget errs in deducing the psychological relationship of concepts from their logical interdependence has been echoed by others . Parsons ( 1960 ) has strongly criticized Piaget 's use of logical models ; he argues , for example , that Piaget has nowhere shown that subjects actually think in terms of the truth-functional form of the group . Parsons ' strictures receive support from studies by Smedslund ( 1963b ) and Jenkins and Ward ( 1965 ) which conclude that adults with no training in statistics do not have a cognitive structure corresponding to the concept of correlation . It must be recalled , though , that Piaget 's own view is that the correspondenceof logical model with actual thought is a matter for experimental confirmation . In this context , the work of Seggie ( 1969 , 1970 ) is of interest , since it represents an attempt to examine the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept learning . He has found a significant relationship between the difficulty of a concept and the subject 's tendency to use **29;2735;TOOLONG , and that adults are relatively more efficient in the use of logical relationships than adolescents . COMPETENCE AND PERFORMANCEReviewing this research , one can not but be impressed by the evidence of structure in thinking and in its development ; many studies point to the orderly character of development and to the existence of developmentallevels , as evidenced by interrelationships among tasks . Equally impressive , on the other hand , is the evidence for variation in performancedue , largely , to variations in the characteristics of the environment encountered by the organism : this is true at the sensori-motor level , with the decalages in person and object permanence and the effect of handling ' upon the development of the sensori-motor co-ordinations ; at the concrete-operational level , with the existence of variations in concept attainment due to such factors as task complexity or the degree of verbalization required of the child ; and at the formal operational level , with the suggestion that the correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects actually think is less thanp85perfect . If the evidence points to both order and variability , what are we to make of the concept of stage ? Note in the first place that Piaget 's system contains a logical model , which permits a fairly precise testing of predictions about the structural aspects of development , and the general notion of the **32;2766;TOOLONG . Many investigators have argued that the demonstration of deviations from the predictions of the logical model , namely , lack of a constant order of succession and no interrelationships between logically related tests , is sufficient to invalidate the concept of stages and the theory underpinning this concept . Stone and Ausubel ( 1969 ) reason in this way ; and the reasoning is sound enough , in so far as it relates either to predictions made from the logical model alone , or from the assumption that the logical model describes the structure of thinking and the concepts of adaptation and equilibration are introduced merely in order to explain or guarantee this structure . But there is another interpretation of the meaning of these concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaget tells us , signifies an accommodation of the organism to the characteristics of the environment ; therefore , the development of logical thinking will be subject to variation as a result of these characteristics , but , with further experience and because logical thinking is an abstraction from action and not from these characteristics , there will be increasing evidence of integrated structures that will match those described by the logical model . On this interpretation the existence of logical structures may be reconciled with the existence of variations due to task and situation variables and the concept of stage retained as a useful summary of this state of affairs . However , although the logical model permits the systematic descriptionof operational structures , we are not able , at the moment , to be equally systematic about those variables which produce decalages ' . Piaget ( 197oa ) has acknowledged this fact and has suggested that further research will help to clarify the nature of the resistances ' of things to operational activity . An indication of the direction which this research must pursue is given by Flavell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the logical , competence model , which represents what the subject knows or could do in an environment which offers no resistance to his activity , we need a performance ' model , which representsthe psychological processes by which the information embodied in competence actually gets utilized in real situations . There are , therefore , two main determinants of the child 's performance in a cognitive task ; the rules , upon whose application the solution of thep86task depends , and a set of variables related to task-difficulty , such as familiarity and complexity of the stimulus material , the role played by memory and the amount of irrelevant information . In other words , we need to know Pa , the probability that a given operation is functionalfor the subject , and Pb , a coefficient applying to a given task and reflecting the influence of the performance variables . Applying this analysis to the stage concept , Flavell and Wohlwill argue that investigations of the interrelationships between tasks should take into account the existence of four distinct phases : a phase in which competence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be low for lack of variance , a second phase in which competence becomes established ( Pa increases from o to an ideal of z ) and in which correlationsare still low due to oscillations in competence , a third phase characterized by greater consistency , for items of equivalent Pbs are passed about equally often and items of discrepant Pbs exhibit a Guttman-type pattern , and , finally , a phase in which both Pa and Pb are maximal so that the subject will be successful in most , if not all , tasks . CROSS-CULTURAL STUDIESCross-cultural studies may be regarded as a means of exploring those factors which produce variability in thinking . Piaget 's view that logical thinking is the result of a process of abstraction from actions common to all men ( a process which he terms logico-mathematical experience ) implies the generality of operational structures across cultural variations . An alternative position is to argue that these cultural variations are sufficiently important to produce radically different modes of thought . Bruner , Olver and Greenfield ( 1966 ) , for example , reason that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of amplifiers ' that a culture has in stock , that is , what images , skills and symbolic representations the culture has developed and transmits to its members . Perhaps the essential difference between these two positions is that , whereas Bruner regards the cultural givens ' as amplifiers or instruments that shape thought into certain moulds , Piaget might regard them more as resistances ' necessary for the development of operational thought in the sense that they are particular manifestations , to which the individual must accommodate in order that he develop general operational co-ordinations . Stated in this way , the difference between the two is not that one emphasizes cultural factors and the other does not . For Piagetian theory , far from denying the influence ofp87cultural variables , would actually predict that attainments within any one major period of development would vary according to cultural preoccupations , since these are part-and-parcel of that to which the subject accommodates . But these variations would be variations within the general developmental process , because the equilibration mechanism and the transition from sensori-motor through perceptual to operational modes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , goes beyond this position when he maintains that cultural preoccupations influence not only the rate of progress but also the mechanism of thinking : he argues that Western culture favours the development of the linguistic-symbolic mode of representation whereas other cultures represent reality in terms of actions or images . Thus , to borrow a phrase from another of Bruner 's works ( Bruner , Goodnow and Austin , 1956 ) , he believes that one should talk of culturally determined strategies of thinking rather than a general sequence cutting across cultural differences . Bruner refers to the experiment by Greenfield ( Bruner , Olver and Greenfield , 1966 ) on conservation of quantity in Wolof children of Senegal as support for this view . Greenfield found that both rural and urban children who were attending school showed the familiar developmentalsequence with conservation attained in all cases by 12 years of age . In contrast , half of the unschooled rural children had not attained conservation at this age . Bruner 's comment upon this experiment is that these children do not achieve verbal conservation but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of their life . He concludes from this and other studies , therefore , that , since technologicalsocieties emphasize linguistic representation rather than action or imagery , tests based upon this cultural emphasis will underestimate the understanding of children from other kinds of society . The unschooledWolof child , like the 4-year-old European child , possesses the concept of conservation pragmatically ; his deficiency lies in the linguistic expression of this understanding . Several studies indicate considerable cross-cultural variations in Piagetian tasks . Goodnow and Bethon ( 1966 ) report a significant difference between American and unschooled Chinese children on a task of combinatorial reasoning ; Peluffo 's ( 1964 ) study of deprived Italian children confirms the vulnerability of combinatorial reasoning . Pascal-Leone and Bovet ( 1966 ) found that the conservation of time is particularly variable across cultures , and Vernon ( 1969 ) reports poor conservation performance in Ugandan and Eskimo children . Mermelsteinand Shulman ( 1967 ) , after comparing groups of Negro childrenp88with varying amounts of formal schooling , suggest that significant differences between verbal and non-verbal tasks point to the importance of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , cross-cultural stability of certain Piagetian tasks has been demonstrated in a number of studies . The evidence points to greatest stability for conservation of quantity , weight and volume ( Goodnow , 1969a , b ) . Hyde ( 1959 ) confirmed Piaget 's findings on a multiracial group in Aden with respect to numerical understanding and conservation of quantity . Price-Williams ( 1962 ) studied the occurrence of abstract and concrete modes of classification in children of the Nigerian Tiv tribe . Using material with which the children were familiar , he found that literate and illiterate groups did not differ significantly and that the formation of class concepts proceeded in a fashion similar to that observed in Western children . Goodnow and Bethon ( 1966 ) reported that the performance of unschooled Chinese children on conservation of weight , surface and volume did not differ significantly from that of an American sample . Similarly , Vernon ( 1969 ) observed a close correspondence between the performance of English and West Indian schoolboys on tasks assessing conservation of surface , quantity and volume . Goodnow ( 1969b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal hypotheses are , tentatively , adopted . The first is that the tasks less vulnerable to cross-cultural variation are those for which the child has an action model . She points out that the studies by Goodnow and Bethon ( 1966 ) , Peluffo ( 1964 ) and Price-Williams ( 1962 ) support the view that children with little formal schooling may depend in particular on action and manipulation . Greenfield 's unschooled Wolof children demonstrate this feature well . A relevant investigation in this connection is that of Price-Williams , Gordon and Ramirez ( 1969 ) relating skill in pottery-making to conservation of liquid , substance , weight and volume in Mexican children . The second hypothesis states that the more vulnerable tasks may be those requiring some kind of non-motor representation ? words , drawings or visual imagery . This would account for the poorer performance of some of Vernon 's groups on imaging tests and the poorer performance for combinatorial tasks by Goodnow and Bethon and Peluffo on the assumption that combinatorial reasoning requires the manipulation of symbols . Much more cross-cultural research is necessary before firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest in suggesting that the opposing conceptions of Piaget and Bruner may be reconciled up to a point . On Piaget 's theory , it may bep89anticipated that action provides the means for cross-cultural generality and that such generality would be particularly evident for those conservations attained through concrete operations . Equally , Bruner 's insistence on the importance of language in the thinking of people in technological societies is vindicated by the inability of people in non-technological societies to manipulate symbols in conventional formal reasoning tasks . There may , then , be a general developmental sequence , but the occurrence of the later phases of this sequence is contingent upon the presence of a language adapted to the needs of hypothetical-deductive thinking . However , Bruner would quarrel with this formulation since he denies that internalized operations are the fundamental factors in conservation or in intellectual development as a whole . He believes that the primary mechanism responsible for conservation is a primitive sense of the identity of an object ; for example , if a single quantity of liquid , first contained in a standard beaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only similarity ' between the two is achieved through maintenance of their identity ? it is the same liquid . Bruner assumes that this sense of identity is either innate or develops well before the child is active in the manipulation of objects . This view of conservation may be related to those studies which have shown conservation responses in young children when language is reduced to a minimum ( e.g. Cohen , 1967 ) . On Bruner 's view , it is not a question of an operational understanding preceding its verbal expression , but of an understanding based upon an identity argument being obscured by the verbal nature of the conventional conservation tests . This issue of the mechanism of conservation attainment must now , therefore , be consideredmore fully . THE ATTAINMENT OF CONSERVATIONThe concept of conservation has been the focus of research inspired by Piaget 's theory into the mechanism of intellectual development . The strategy of this research is to train children who exhibit **25;2800;TOOLONG on the assumption that the training technique which is most effective in the laboratory is probably the most important influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of these studies appear to be guided by one of three general theories about the nature of intellectual development . There are , in the first place , studies within the traditional Piagetian framework ; on the view that the child attains conservation when he has mastered the appropriatep90operations , these studies attempt to teach understanding of reversibility or compensation , or instruct the child in the rules according to which we say that a property is conserved , or attempt to induce him to understand the logical necessity of conservation by equilibration training . A second view , which we have encountered in Bruner 's work and in studies showing the influence of language on the age of attainment of the concept , is that the young child who fails on a conventional measure of conservation really possesses the concept but is unable to express it , either because he lacks linguistic ability or because he is temporarily misled by perceptual cues . On the third view , it is argued that the concept is acquired as a result of experience ; however , this experience is not logico-mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , reinforcement and exposure to adult models . This viewpoint , therefore , agrees with the first , rather than the second , in assuming that the young child does not possess the concept , but agrees with the second , rather than the first , in the importance it attaches to factors other than operational ones . Piaget would , no doubt , characterize these alternatives to operationalism as a structuralism without genesis ' or a geneticism without structure ' ( Piaget , 1969 ) . Training in Operations and RulesThe evidence suggests that operational or rule-learning training procedures are often effective in fostering conservation responses but it is by no means clear how and why these procedures are effective . For example , Wallach and Sprott ( 1964 ) trained children to understand the operation of reversibility by having them reverse the experimenter 's action ; the success of this technique led the investigators to believe that reversibility was the key to conservation attainment . However , they and other authors ( e.g. Bruner , Olver and Greenfield , 1966 ) reported many cases of children understanding reversibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wall and Anderson , 1967 ) they confirmed the role of reversibility training but argued that the effect of this training was to stop subjects using a misleading perceptual cue , namely the appearance of one object being left over after the others in the two rows had been paired . But the authors affirmed that recognizing a misleading cue is not sufficient to account for a property being regarded the same after certain transformations and that , therefore , the child must both recognize reversibility and not rely on inappropriate cues in order to conserve . Roll ( 1970 ) also found reversibility training to be effective.  |p91The  evidence on the role of compensation ( or addition-subtraction ) is equivocal . Wohlwill ( 196o ) , Wohlwill and Lowe ( 1962 ) and Smedslund ( 1961a ) report data suggesting that training children in adding an element to a collection or subtracting one from it can lead to the child inferring conservation as a result of change involving neither addition nor subtraction . Winer ( 1968 ) reports some success with this technique , but Wallach , Wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of training to be ineffective . However , Bruner , Olver and Greenfield(1966) found that a training technique which provided children with verbal labels for compensating attributes was effective in inducing conservation when children were allowed to manipulate the stimulus material . Smedslund ( 1961a , b , c , d , e ) developed the hypothesis that conservationoriginates from a conflict between the addition-subtraction scheme and the child 's perception of the deformation of objects . Studying the conservation of weight , Smedslund 's procedure was to deform one ball of plasticine into a sausage-shape while , at the same time , subtractinga piece from the other ball . Theoretically , if the child saw the deformation as making the one ball lighter and the subtraction as making the other ball lighter , there should be a cognitive conflict which might well produce a resolution in the form of a conservation judgement . In Smedslund 's earlier studies , only five out of a hundred subjects had changed to conservation as a result of other training procedures ; since the conflict training induced conservation in four out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging result . Gruen ( 1965 ) found some support for the conflict hypothesis , but Winer ( 1968 ) did not . In addition , several studies have reported success with training procedures which have combined two or more operations in a training programme . Successful training has been reported for a programme which included classification , compensation and reversibility training ( Sigel , Roeper and Hooper , 1966 ) , for compensation and identity ( Lefrancois , 1968 ) , for a reversibility and cognitive conflict procedure ( Murray , 1968 ) and for reversibility , identity and compensation ( Sullivan , 1967 , 1969 ; Rothenberg and Orost , 1969 ) . Beilin 's ( 1965 ) subjects were successfully trained on verbal rules , which embodied either compensation for length conservation or reversibility for number conservation , and Smith ( 1968 ) has confirmed the efficacy of such training . However , Beilin ( 1969 ) has argued that his subjects learn a model or algorithm for solving a specific type of problem rather than the principles of reversibility or compensation themselves.  |p92Identity  and ConservationBut Bruner believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruner , Olver and Greenfield , 1966 , p. 185 ) which , he holds , is the product of a primitive sense of identity rather than the application of logical operations . The young child is a non-conserver ' , not , therefore , because he is in a pre-operational period of development , but because his understanding of identity is obscured by perceptual cues or because of his inability to use words like more ' and same ' as adults do . A number of studies have attempted to demonstrate the nature of the young child 's perceptual difficulties . After showing the child a half-full standard beaker and an empty comparison beaker , Frank ( reported in Bruner , Olver and Greenfield , 1966 ) placed the two behind a screen before pouring the liquid from one to the other . She then asked the child whether there was still the same amount of water . It was found that this screening procedure led , in all subjects except the 4-year-olds , to a conservation judgement . This was interpreted as supporting the view that the 5-year-old child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that screening derives its effectiveness from forcing the child to rely upon an identity argument . Feigenbaum and Sulkin ( 1964 ) corroborated this finding , but Strauss and Langer ( 1970 ) could not do so . Gelman 's ( 1969 ) analyses support the view that the young child does not have to learn to define quantity and invariance de novo but has to learn to avoid reliance upon misleading perceptual cues . Minichiello and Goodnow ( 1969 ) allowed children to observe the experimenter pour water simultaneously from two cups into two differently shaped beakers and attributed the successful outcome of this training to its drawing the child 's attention away from perceptual cues . Halford ( 1968 ) found conservers to be superior to non-conservers in the recognition of equal and unequal quantities in different shaped containersin the absence of a known standard : this performance seems , therefore , to reflect an intuitive or perceptual estimation . Studies which appear to support a semantic interpretation of conservationhave been referred to in an earlier section ( e.g. Braine and Shanks , 1965 ; Cohen , 1967 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has been pointed out that there are examples of non-conservers who do know the relevant words ( Inhelder et al. , 1966 ) and that the semantic interpretation does not provide an adequate explanation of the behaviour of children in the transitional stage who assert conservationin some instances but not in others ( Flavell , 1963 ) . Moreover , Oleron ( 1961 ) and Furth ( 1966 ) have shown that deaf children do notp93differ greatly from hearing children with respect to the age of conservationattainment , although the interpretation that this result signifies the prime importance of operations rather than language per se has been challenged by Ausubel ( 1968 ) , who has argued that deaf children are by no means isolated from socialized verbal language . Peters ( 1970 ) has found verbal training for conservation to be effective . Piaget ( 1968b ) has replied to Bruner by distinguishing between preoperativeand operative identity . The former relates to single , qualitative invariants and it is this sense of identity which Frank 's subjects rely upon in the screening condition when they say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same water ) . But for Piaget this is a pseudoconservationsince this sense of identity alone does not enable the child to recognize that the quantity is unchanged . This achievement requires the co-ordination of physical dimensions and can only occur when operative identity , dealing with quantitative invariants , is established and co-ordinated with the operations of reversibility and compensation . Thus , true conservation depends upon operational competence . Reinforcement and Social LearningConventional reinforcement procedures seem to be ineffective in inducing conservation . Wohlwill ( 1959 , 1960 ) , Wohlwill and Lowe ( 1962 ) and Smedslund ( 1961a , b , d ) attempted , without success , to train children in this way . Smedslund ( 1961b ) demonstrated that children who had acquired the conservation of weight by control on a balance reverted to non-conservation response when confronted with instances of apparent non-conservation ( Smedslund surreptitiously removed a piece of plasticine from one of the balls ) , whereas half of the subjects who had acquired the concept normally ' resisted the attempt at extinction and interpreted the apparent non-conservation as meaning that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , open to the criticism that insufficient reinforcement experience was provided . Success has been reported , however , for techniques involving the child 's exposure to a model . Sullivan ( 1967 , 1969 ) and Waghorn and Sullivan ( 1970 ) managed to induce conservation judgements by exposing subjects to filmed models who verbalized the principles ( reversibility , compensation , etc. ) underlying conservation . Whilst it is not immediately clear just how Sullivan 's subjects learned conservation , these experiments do raise the question of how much adult intervention is necessary for understanding the concept . There are opposing views on this matter . Beilin ( 1969 ) contends that the likelihood of the child achieving this insight solelyp94through his own actions is slight . On the other hand , as Wallach ( 1969 ) points out , the social learning hypothesis leaves unexplained how anyone ever began to believe in the principle or how it is possible for people from widely different cultures to possess essentially the same concept . These opposing views bring us to perhaps the most general issue underlying research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demonstrating that a number of variables may be influential but it does not enable us to state that one is more fundamentalthan another . The Piagetian view that conservation is attained when competence in the operations of reversibility and compensation is attained receives some support , but the existence of such operational competence alongside non-conservation responses suggests that this can not be a sufficient condition . Pre-operative identity may be a precursorof genuine conservation , but the understanding of quantitative invariances seems to call for the understanding of operational coordinations . Similarly , language , the overcoming of perceptual errors and exposure to adult models may be important influences but it is difficult to imagine how they can be constituted as sufficient causes of conservation . Does this not all suggest that we should move away from nothing-but-arguments ' to a study of the interaction of the relevant variables ? For it seems fair to say that this state of affairs has come about because , on the one hand , workers within the traditional Piagetian framework have tended to focus upon competence and training in operations to the neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , those who have wished to oppose operationalismhave either tended to point to these variables , as if their mere existence were enough to discredit the theory , or to resort to the conceptof a primitive sense of identity , as though this dispensed with the necessity of explaining the development of operational competence and its role in problem-solving . But , granted that the outcome of a conservationtask is a function of the subject 's ability to use certain operations , of the nature of the task and of the extent to which the subject can draw upon a facilitating language and cultural background , then the basic problem is to find the right measure for each of them . In general terms , this implies the study of what Hunt ( 1961 ) called the match ' between environmental circumstances and the operational schemes of the subject . These schemes develop and are effective only in an environmentwhich facilitates them ; conversely , the environmental circumstances are effective in so far as they provide opportunities for the subject to use his operational schemes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only possible relationship between environment and operativity is one of reciprocity . Most of the research on conservationwould appear not to have been informed by this model , since this would entail that the testing of the logical model and the systematic manipulation of stimulus events are regarded as necessarily parallel activities . THE ADAPTATION MODELThe significance of these ideas can , perhaps , best be understood through considering some of the criticisms directed towards Piaget 's theory . I believe that many of these criticisms can be refuted but that , nevertheless , they indicate important shortcomings in the manner in which the theory has been applied . Consider , for example , how the often-repeated criticism ( e.g. Fowler , 1962 ; Bandura and Walters , 1965 ) that the theory is essentially a maturational perspective which regards behaviour as being determined largely by factors intrinsic to the organism is contradicted by the idea that development in thought occurs because of adaptation to the environment , an idea which certainly gives experience its due . Now , although this refutation is clear-cut , the manner in which Piaget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the concept of equilibration , which appears to guarantee the development of a mode of thinking that is both logical and adapted to its environment , lends some justification to the complaint that the role of environmental circumstances has been neglected . As Lunzer ( 1968 ) says , it is generally felt that Piaget attributes too much order and structure to thinking . Thus , Bruner ( 1959 ) criticizes the concept of equilibration on the grounds that it is not precise enough to specify how different modes of thought arise in response to the demands which the environment makes upon the subject . Thus , Boyle ( 1969 ) characterizesPiaget 's theory as a closed system in which all internal forces are accounted for rather than one which specifies the various interactions of subject and environment . In a sense , therefore , it is true to say that the concept of adaptation is an ideal principle rather than a useful description of what actually happens . But it would be misleading to allow these comments to stand as the verdict upon the theory , since the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought and behaviour which allows us to supersede the immediate limitations of research inspired by the theory and the partial truths of these criticisms.  |p96This  insight is that environmental events do not impose their nature upon a passive organism any more than the organism produces whateverresults it desires on an indifferent environment because all knowledge is simultaneously accommodation to the object and assimilation to the subject . The progress of intelligence works in the dual direction of externalization and internalization and the development of operational structures parallels the construction of reality . This idea is most evidentin the work on sensori-motor development where it is plain that adaptation signifies the development of schemes and , simultaneously , the development of stimulus discrimination and generalization , but it surely has general application . The principle has a number of implications . Operational competence is not reducible to environmental circumstances ( the error of empiricism ) , nor is performance merely a distorting influence ( the error of idealism ) . To say that a subject has a certain level of operational competence is to say that his competence is manifest under certain stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject 's performance is to say that they act in conjunction with the subject 's operational competence ; and moreover , these two statements are equivalent . Competence may be defined as the subject 's understanding of operations or rules but it can only be measured by observing the extent to which the subject makes use of this understandingin a range of tasks ; because of this , Flavell and Wohlwill 's ( 1969 ) mathematical model , in which operational competence increases to a maximum at substage two independently of task variations , is not true to the central insight of the adaptation concept . Equally , it is impossible to assess stimulus control independently of the subject 's operational competence . This entails that the testing of the logical model , which is to describe the structure of the subject 's thought , and the manipulation of stimulus events , which is to result in a description of the conditions which facilitate or impede this thought , are necessarily parallel activities . This confrontation of logic and psychology is , after all , one of the reasons why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable influence upon theory and research.  |p97Conce|pt  Formationp99The theory of abstractionTHE PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUNDThe theory of abstraction can be traced back to Aristotle , who opposed the doctrine that there are innate ideas in favour of the view that all our knowledge is derived from particular things : thinking , he maintained , is a matter of proceeding from the particular to the general and then , by analysis of the general , back to the particular . Aristotle 's theory of knowledge was elaborated by medieval scholastic philosophers , but it was also taken up by British empiricist philosophers such as Hobbes and , more notably , John Locke . Locke , in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 169o ) , identified two sources of ideas which he termed sensation and reflection . The senses convey into the mind distinct perceptions of things , for instance , their colour or shape , while he defines reflection as the perception of the operations of our own minds , as when we perceive ourselves to be thinking or believing or doubting . Locke held that sensation and reflection provide us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help but receive these impressions , the mind is passive in their reception . In contrast , the mind is active in forming complex ideas ' from the simple ones . When simple ideas are combined into complex ones , Locke calls them mixed modes ' ; for example , the idea of beauty is constituted by the combination of colour and figure . In a crucial passage Locke states that ideas become general by separating from them the circumstances of time , and place , and any other ideas that may determine them to this or that particular existence . By this way of abstraction they are made capable of representing more individuals than one ; each of which , having in it a conformity to that abstract idea , is ( as we call it ) of that sort ' ( Book III , Ch. 3 , 6 ) . Thus , children begin by using names which refer to particular individuals , such as mummy and daddy , but notice , as they grow older , that therep100are a great many other things in the world which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea ' which embraces these similarities , for instance , the name man ' . Substituting concept ' for idea ' , this view asserts that it is by a process of abstraction that concepts are formed ; we observe a number of particular objects and abstract ( literally , draw away ) from then those features that are common to several of them . Concepts are formed when objects are classified . From Locke 's account , it is evident that there are two aspects to this process . Not only must we notice similarities to form a general idea , but we must also set aside particular differences , which are not relevant to the concept in question . The former corresponds to what we now call generalization , the latter to discrimination . In attempting to demonstrate that abstract ideas are not present in children but are acquired only through experience , Locke referred to the general idea of a triangle , which , he maintained , does not indicate any particular type of triangle but which refers to all types and none of them at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge ( 1708 ) , argued that it is impossible that an idea should combine inconsistent qualities . If we form the concept of a triangle , it must be a particular triangle ; if we form the concept of a man , it must be a man of some particular colour , shape and height . Every idea must have a single determinate set of qualities and , accordingly , Berkeley denied that there are abstract ideas , in Locke 's sense of the term . He did not deny that there are general ideas , but he thought that what Locke called a general idea is really a particular idea which is made general by being taken as a sign for other particular ideas , between which there is some resemblance . Thus , whilst Locke 's general idea is the representation of the common nature of a number of particular ideas , Berkeley 's general idea depends only upon the particular ideas resembling one another in some way . In spite of this important disagreement , the ideas of Locke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empiricist tradition with its emphasis upon the primacy of sensation in the acquisition of concepts . The net effect of Berkeley 's critique was to transfer the traditional notion of the concept to another dimension . If simple , sensory data are all that we can hope to know without falling into error and illusion , then concepts are derived when we compare , not objects in the environment , but presentations or representations of those objects . The contents of perception , not the things themselves , are the stimuli which serve as the units for abstraction . The theory ofp101abstraction has altered little since this time . If anything , as Reeves ( 1965 ) points out , the tradition gave increasing emphasis to the view that thinking consists of the formation of concepts through the associationof simple , sensory elements , the doctrine receiving its most radical formulation by john Stuart Mill . The process of abstracting is still widely regarded as the key to our thought processes . The vitality of the doctrine may be seen in a recent , philosophical exposition of it by Price ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical approaches to abstraction that we have encountered in the different conceptions of Locke and Berkeley . Price distinguishes between the theory of universals , according to which general ideas are formed by abstraction of the common feature in a number of particular perceptions , and the theory of resemblances , according to which the subject takes a specific perceptual item and groups other items in respect of their resemblance to it . Price favours the latter theory , holding that it provides a more accurate psychological description of the process of abstraction . In outline , his argument takes the following form . In order that the subject can group perceptual data by their resemblances , he must , clearly , be capable of recognizing these resemblances . Recognition , for Price , is a type of sign cognition ' , which he defines as the act of responding to a stimulus as a sign of another stimulus , when that other stimulus is not present . For example , we have learned to recognize that an overcast sky signifies rain , or that the notice , Warning ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory is the belief that the simpler forms of sign cognition are within the capabilities of animals and that the major advance attained in human sign cognition is the relatively greater independence of signs from immediate stimulation . But the main consequence of Price 's theory is that a concept may be regarded as a system of recognitional dispositions , rather than an abstracted common feature , a disposition being defined as a readiness to respond in a particular way determined largely by previous learning to particular signs . Such a theory permits a behaviouristic approach to concept formation and we shall see that Price 's theory is compatible with contemporary , psychological approaches based upon an S-R orientation . ABSTRACTION THEORY IN PSYCHOLOGYIt is possible to discern three phases in the use of abstraction theory , with corresponding variations in the definition of the concept , in psychological research . Initially , there was the introspectionist period ,  |p102in  which the empiricist doctrine tended to be accepted without any substantial change . This was followed by the behaviourist approach , in which conscious acts of judgement and recognition were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent phase may be characterized as neo-behaviourist in orientation , since the laws of learning formulated in the earlier period are retained , while at the same time processes mediating between external stimulus and response are introduced . This classification is , to be sure , an idealized one , depicting only the main trend of theorizing , but my main purpose at the moment is to show to what extent the essential aspects of abstraction theory itself remain unaltered and unchallenged by these developments . The introspectionist approach may be seen in Wundt 's theorizing and in the experiments performed during the first two decades of this century . Wundt ( 1894 ) defined abstraction as the procedure by which certain constituent parts are eliminated from a compound idea or from several such ideas and what remains is retained as the elements of a concept ' ( p. 1x ) . Like Locke , he distinguished between singular concepts ' and general concepts ' , arguing that the former are transformedinto the latter by acts of judgement which organize and relate experiences . The majority of researchers in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceiving common elements . In Fisher 's ( 1916 ) experiment , for example , the subject had to learn to associate nonsense syllables with figures capable of being classified in a number of ways : his task was to abstract the common features in the figures and ignore the irrelevant differences . Similar experiments were carried out by , among others , Griinbaum ( 1908 ) , Moore ( 1910 ) and Aveling ( 1912 ) . Introspectionism was overthrown with the emergence of behaviourism , which denied that we need to resort to consciousness in order to understand concept formation . Hull ( 1920 ) used the conditioning paradigm , asserting that a concept is formed through the establishment of associative links between the identical element in a number of stimuli and a particular response . Thus a child learns the concept dog ' by hearing the word dog ' in a number of somewhat different ' situations . Hull 's experiments , in which subjects learned to attach nonsense syllables to the common elements in a number of Chinese letters , were designed to demonstrate that concept formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal learning . If this is correct , it follows that animals can learn simple concepts too . Fields ( 1932 ) , in a paper entitled The development of the concept of triangu/larity by the white rat ' , showed that rats can be trained to respond consistently to triangles in a discrimination task when the size and orientation of the triangle is varied during training . Fields thought that the animal learns the concept through stimulus generalization . Thus , if the animal is trained to respond to a large , equilateral triangle by being rewarded when approaching it , the training will generalize to smaller and larger equilateral triangles and also to triangles which depart from the equilateral form . If the rat is also trained to respond to triangles having varying angles and sides of varying length , the generalization gradients will overlap to such an extent that the animal will respond to any stimulus which has the three-pointed characteristic of triangles . We may then attribute to the rat the concept of triangularity . In the same way , it may be argued , the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an identical manner to objects which initially appear different , the child succeeds in making a generalization about the objects and we refer to this generalization as a concept . This reasoning lies behind a simple experiment by Long ( 1940 ) with children from 3 to 6 years of age . A box with two small windows was placed before the child ; if he pressed on the correct window , a small piece of candy rolled out to him . At first , he saw a rubber ball through one window and a rectangular block of wood through the other . When the child had learned to choose the ball regularly , he was tested for equivalent ' stimuli ; that is , spherical objects of various sizes , colours and materials were paired with various angular objects . Long found that the spheres were consistently chosen and concluded that this sort of learning is responsible for the development of the concept of a sphere in real life . Thus , whereas the introspectionists regarded concept formation as a conscious process of identifying common features and , as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained that the concept was formed through the conditioning of a response to common features and that , consequently , animals , children and human adults could all possess concepts in some form or another . What is common to the two approaches is the assumption of the philosophy of universals about identical elements . The third perspective , that of mediational learning theory , characteristically rejects this assumption , although retaining the conditioning model with additional processes intervening between external stimulus and response ? the so-called mediational processes , whose presence or absence carries implications for the comparative development of concepts in animals and humans . Let us examine these three characteristics in turn.  |p1041  . Identical stimulus elements . Smoke ( 1932 ) had already questioned Hull 's theory that abstraction necessarily involved identical elements . What , he asked , are the identical stimulus elements present in , say , the various kinds of dog ? Smoke thought that it made more sense to talk of common perceptual relations and substantiated this by successfullytraining subjects to attach nonsense syllables to figures which varied widely in their physical dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Osgood ( 1953 ) advanced this reasoning a step further by arguing that common perceptual relations are no more essential to concept formation than identical elements . There is , for example , no common perceptual relation between mittens , hats and neckties , although they are classifiable under the concept of clothing ' , or between crawling , swimming and flying , although these are all types of movement . He concluded that the only essential condition for concept formation is the learning of a common response for a group of objects or situations , not necessarily containing any features in common . Kendler ( 1961 ) had Osgood 's theory in mind when she defined the concept as a common response to dissimilar stimuli ' . 2 . Mediational processes . According to Osgood , what has to be taken into account in the explanation of human conceptual behaviour is the presence of signs ? principally words ? which mediate between stimulus and response . Osgood 's theory , which is derived from the theory of signs proposed by Morris ( 1946 ) , is that a word becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the object of which it is the sign ; this behaviour is a partial revival of what occurred in the first instance and it acts as an internalized stimulus to an overt response . Thus , for example , the external stimulus ( S ) of a dog initially produces an overt response ( R ) of approaching , stroking , etc . The word dog ' is associated with the presence of various sorts of dog and this sign , because of its repeated association with S , becomes capable of eliciting the kind of behaviour typified in the overt response , for example , anticipatory approach movements . This response ( r ) then acts as a stimulus ( s ) to the overt response ( R ) , and can do so in the absence of S. This process may be represented schematically : 1 . S ( dog ) R ( behaviour of approaching , stroking , etc. ) 2 . S ' ( dog ' ) - rm sm Rl ( elements of ( distinctive ( anticipatorythe original pattern of approachresponse ) self-stimulation ) movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign cognition as the act of responding to a stimulus as a sign of another stimulus , when the other stimulus is not present . The organism having mediational processes in its repertoire is relatively free from a dependence upon immediate stimulation and it is able to handle new instances of concepts effectively by relating them to its store ' of signs. 3 . Developmental differences in concept formation . Osgood was critical of earlier assumptions that animals and humans possess concepts in much the same form . He pointed out that we can not say that the rat in the experiment by Fields has acquired the concept of triangularity in the same way that a.human adult has the concept . We can not say that the rat has the abstract concept of the triangle , in that it would not , probably , react positively to three people or to three places on a map as triangles . Kendler and Kendler ( 1962 ) have demonstrated important differences in concept formation between animals and humans and have attributed these differences to the existence of mediational responding in humans and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next chapter . As Pikas ( 1966 ) says , the definition of concept formation as the learning of a common response to dissimilar stimuli most faithfully expresses the dominant contemporary orientation . This definition arose from the insight that identical physical elements or common perceptual relations are not essential for concept formation . It would appear , then , that the phrase dissimilar stimuli ' should be taken to mean stimuli not alike physically or from the point of view of perceptual relation ' , but , of course , as H. H. Kendler ( 1964 ) has acknowledged , it is impossible to say that any two objects are entirely dissimilar : all objects , for instance , have weight and substance , and they are all something . What this definition of the concept really achieves , therefore , is a broadening of the concept of the concept to include other kinds of classification besides those based upon the identity or similarity of physical or perceptual-relational elements , for instance , the classificationof mittens , hats and neckties by their function as clothing , or the classification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of movement ' . There are , in short , as many types of concept as there are criteria for relating the stimuli which constitute them . What , then , is the current status of the theory of abstraction in psychology ? The idea that a concept does not necessarily entail identical elements or resemblances in the stimuli themselves and that the onlyp106essential feature of a concept is the association of a common response to a variety of stimuli is directly contrary to the theory . Are we to conclude that abstraction theory has been totally replaced ? Unfortunately , the position is complicated by the fact that two different interpretationshave been placed upon the new orientation . One of these merely assigns a less important role in concept learning to the notion of abstraction , whereas on the other interpretation it is rejected totally and replaced by a conditioning model , whose principal explanatory concept is the mechanism of association . On the first interpretation it may be argued that there are different kinds of concepts corresponding to the mechanisms responsible for their attainment and that abstraction is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenkins argue in this way . Gagne ( 1966 ) reasons that the concepts which experimenters get subjects to learn in the laboratory are valid enough , but that there are other concepts which appear as altogether too complex to be viewed in this light , for example , physical concepts , such as gravitation , heat and light . Gagne says that concepts like work ' are more properly defined as principles and should not be equated with simple concepts . The problem of fitting principles into the scheme of learning theory can be solved , he believes , by interpreting them as being relationships among two or more concepts . With the principle of work , for instance , a subject must learn thatwork = force x distance . The subject who is to understand this principle must identify several concepts and their proper sequence . He must identify a member of the class force ' ( a concept ) , a member of the class distance ' ( another concept ) and an instance of the class product ' or multiply ' ( a third concept ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product . In short , demonstration of a rule or principle involves the simpler performances of identifying each concept and the sequence that relates them . ( This reasoning is very reminiscent of Locke 's mixed modes ' . ) Very similar reasoning is advanced by Jenkins ( 1966 ) , who distinguishes between three kinds of concepts . The first is the concept that is formed through the isolation of some aspect or aspects of the stimuli which are instances of the concept ? the type of concept dealt with in the traditional theory of abstraction . The second class is that of concepts that depend upon agreement of particular responses to stimuli , the simplest case being that of naming ' or labelling ' responses ? this is the sort of concept that Osgood and Kendler had in mind . The third type is analogous to Gagne 's principles , itsp107distinguishing feature being that it is the expression of the application of a set of rules of relation . It is evident that the effect of such reasoning is to place the theory of abstraction in a perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchallengedas a theory . The persistence of the theory can be seen in Underwood 's ( 1966 ) definition of the concept : The crux of concept learning is the abstraction ? selection ? of a common feature , characteristicor property which is present in a number of stimuli which differ on other characteristics ' ( p. 57 ) . It is also apparent , strangely enough , in a recent paper by Kendler and Kendler ( 1970 ) , who say , in discussing the relationship between mediational processes and the stimuli serving as the material for concept learning , that each of these symbolic responses refers to a class of events that differ in other features but have a given feature in common ' ( p. 24 ) . However , on the second interpretation , abstraction theory is rejected . If a concept is a common response to dissimilar stimuli ' , then it is formed , not through the abstraction of similarities , but through the different stimuli becoming associated with the same response . In short , it is assumed that the first and third types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducible to the second . This seems to be the most consistent interpretation of the Osgood-Kendler definition . Both Osgood and Kendler inform us that the mediational processes obey the same principles that operate in observable S-R relations ( Osgood , 1953 , p. 411 ; Kendler and Kendler , 1962 ) and that it is through conditioning that the common mediational response ? probably a word ? becomes associated with the stimuli that form a particular class . Staats ( 1961 ) puts this case most explicitly when he states that abstraction in the development of concepts depends upon the conditioning of a common mediating response to a variety of stimulus objects exemplary of the concept . In assessing the validity of these interpretations , therefore , we must ask , in the first place , whether it is justifiable to retain the theory of abstraction at all ( even in a relatively minor role ) , and , if not , whether it is justifiable to replace it with a model which relies upon the principle of association ? the conditioning model . CRITIQUE OF THE THEORY OF ABSTRACTIONOpponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the theory is least plausible , namely mathematical and logical concepts , and then continue to demonstrate that the deficienciesp108of the theory in this respect are also evident in those simpler concepts which are the favourite examples of the abstractionists themselves . Mathematical ConceptsJohn Stuart Mill ( 1874 ) , applying the basic , empiricist assumption that all knowledge derives from experience , believed that mathematical concepts were nothing other than expressions of the relationships we find to apply in our dealing with the environment . Accordingly , all mathematical rules are about relationships in the material world that surrounds us and , consequently , they are accidental and variable in the same sense as all such relationships are . If , therefore , we grew up in a different environment , we would have a different kind of arithmetic and geometry , so that on another planet , say , there would be different numerical laws . For example , 2 x 2 might equal 5 and not 4 . Thus , the reverse of the most familiar principles of arithmetic and geometry might have been made conceivable even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coexisted with a totally different constitution of external nature ' ( Mill , 1869 , p. 89 ) . The first mathematician to argue convincingly against Mill was Frege ( 1884 ) . According to Frege , Mill 's fundamental mistake was the assumption that mathematical laws represent abstraction from our experience of things . He maintained that mathematical laws are not laws about objects , since this would deprive them of the objectivity which constitutes their most important feature . For example , one consequence of Mill 's reasoning that our understanding of numbers is based upon our sensory impressions is that this understanding would be restricted to whatever capacity of discrimination we had attained in the perception of a given group of objects . The absurdity of this consequence can be seen very easily , however : the number , 753,684 is just as definitely and clearly differentiated from the number that immediately precedes it and that which follows it as 3 is from 2 or 4 , but who could point out the impression ' by which we discriminate between concrete groups of objects of this size ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstraction were correct , we would not be able to use numbers in respect of non-physical objects , since Mill thought that the operations of counting , etc. , are only possible where things themselves can be collected and separated into perceptible , spatial groups . This , however , is contradicted by the fact that we do operate with non-physical properties as readily as we do with actual things , for example , the number of categories or the number of parliamentary laws . There is a reply to this criticism that will , no doubt , occur to thosep109familiar with psychological learning theory . This is to argue that we begin with comparing and grouping actual objects , but generalize our experiences with these to non-physical events and properties or to larger complexes of objects not actually present . Now , this reasoning may be correct , but , as Cassirer has pointed out , it contains a concealed assumption , whose recognition is quite fatal to the theory of abstraction . For , if it is possible to generalize from the concrete to the non-concrete , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compared cases , by virtue of which the one can be deduced from the other . We would not have the right to extend any determination , which appears to us in any individual group , to groups of a larger or smaller number of elements , if we did not comprehend them all as similar in nature ' . This similarity , however , means nothing more than that they are connected by a definite rule , such as permits us to proceed from one manifold to another by continued , identical application of the same fundamental relation . ( Cassirer , 1953a , p. 30 ) If we did not hold this assumption , we would have to be prepared to admit that it would be impossible to apply the same mathematical rules to groups whose elements differed in size or in type , for every rule would have to be proved anew with every different group . Therefore , the argument of generalization contains the concealed assumption that number concepts are general , but this is the very notion that abstraction theory begins by denying . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary foundations of mathematical concepts . In order to apply the same arithmetical rules to large as well as small groups and to abstract as well as concrete properties , we must , in effect , make a decision that the various kinds of property can be treated as being alike in principle . This amounts to saying that what holds the elements together from the mathematical point of view is the fact that they are all capable of being treated by the same operations . For , as such philosophersas Frege and Cassirer have indicated , mathematical concepts are concerned with relations and are derived , not from the recognition of similarities in groups of objects , but from the various kinds of operations ( e.g. adding , subtracting , etc. ) performed , initially at least , upon objects . For Cassirer , this distinction corresponds to that commonly made between the logic of classes , dealing with the classification of objects according to their perceived similarities , and the logic ofp110relations , which deals with the rules applied in the relating of both concrete and abstract elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of a series by the application of a serial principle , not their agreement in some factual context ( Cassirer , 1950 ) . After a certain starting-point has been fixed by an original assumption , i.e. the concept of 1 as the first member of the set and the general relation of ordering are the basic presuppositions , all further elements are generated by the fact that a relation is given , which in continued application creates all the members of the set . Thus , the system of numbers arises without it being necessary that one element be connected with another by any sort of factual similarity . Once this essential characteristic of number is grasped , it is possible to see that development in mathematics consists of advancing from a system of relatively simple relationships to more complex systems of relations and of creating for them appropriate symbolic expressions . Geach ( 1957 ) makes a similar point when he remarks that the child learning to do arithmetic needs to master a way of talking about number which has nothing to do with groups of concrete units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing n times over ' . Adding 5 to 7 can be explained as performing 5 times over upon the number 7 the operation of going on to the next number ? ( 7 ) 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . Subtraction is similarly explicable in terms of counting backwards . This ability can not be derived from any number of trials in which the child attaches a number label to groups of apples varying in number . Logical ConceptsGeach points out that abstractionists rarely attempt to give an account of logical concepts , like those of some ' , or ' and not ' ; most of them are quite prepared to admit that these concepts are a special case falling outside the scope of the theory . On the other hand , some abstractionistsfeel no such hesitation . As logical concepts obviously can not be abstracted from sensory experience ( there are no instances of or ' and not ' provided by perception ) , the appeal must be made to reflection ' upon our experience . Mill ( 1874 ) , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction , which asserts that an affirmative proposition and the corresponding negative proposition can not both be true . Mill considered this to be a generalization from experience , the foundation for it being that belief and disbelief are two different mental states excluding one another . Similar derivations of logical concepts have been attempted by James ( 1890 ) and Russell ( 1940 ) . The view that logical concepts derive from experience and thatp111therefore , logic is based upon psychology , is known as psychologism ( see Chapter 1 ) . The issue will not be discussed fully here . It may be sufficient to raise two criticisms of the doctrine . In the first place , as Husserl ( 1900 ) argued , Mill 's reduction of the axiom of contradiction to the experience that belief and disbelief are two different mental states is refuted by the simple observation that people often do hold contradictory beliefs without any recognition of their doing so . Now this , on Mill 's theory that the two states of mind are mutually incompatible , would be impossible . Secondly , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same logical concept . For instance , or ' might suggest hesitation to one man but a threat to another ( Geach ) . To be consistent , the abstractionist would have to admit that these individuals possessed different concepts . Yet this does not reflect the actual usage of logical concepts , which do not vary between individuals because of a dependence upon idiosyncraticexperiences , but which , like mathematical concepts , are capable of being used by everybody in the same way . Of course , this is not to say that everyone uses these concepts perfectly efficiently , only that it is a reasonable expectation that everyone could , given the ability and tuition . Both logic and mathematics may be characterized as being concerned with the study of rules of relation . The fact that the elements that they deal with are ordered by such rules lends the quality of necessity to logical and mathematical conceptualization . It is a matter of necessity , not of probability , that 2 x 2 = 4 , because the result inevitably follows from the application of the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other systems with different rules , but this does not affect the issue , for abstractionism is silent about the existence of these rules , although they constitute the essential nature of logico-mathematical thinking . Simple ' ConceptsAgainst this it may be argued that the theory of abstraction can not account for such higher-order concepts but that it does explain simple , everyday concepts like colour ' or man ' . How else , it might be asked , could we develop these concepts except by abstracting resemblances from otherwise dissimilar stimuli ? In contesting that the theory of abstraction accounted for mathematicalconcepts , Cassirer noted that the theory assumes that which it has to explain , namely , the generality of mathematical rules . Likewise , Husserl ( 1901 ) maintained that the view that simple concepts , such as red ' , are formed through the recognition of similarities involves anp112infinite regress since , if to say that an object is red means only that its colour resembles that of other objects , all that I can say is that something is red because something else is red , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the generality of the concept is grasped , somehow , in the initial perception of the red object . We must be able to apprehend the general directly in a single act of perception : Thus we apprehend the species , red ' , directly , in itself , as it were , on the basis of a single perception of something red . We look at the red colour of an object given to us in perception , but we do this in a special kind of act ; an act which aims at the ideal ' , the universal ' . The abstraction in the sense of this act is completely different from mere pointing out or separating the perceived red from the rest of the perceptual context . In order to point out this difference we have repeatedly spoken of the ideating or generalizing abstraction . ( Husserl , 1901 , p. 223 ) As Pivcevic ( 1970 ) says , this act of ideation to which Husserl refers is not to be regarded as a sort of sixth sense ' but as an act of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we turn things into examples by adopting a particularpoint of view . As he points out in Volume III of his major work , The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms ( Cassirer , 1953b ) , the simplest concepts are never a mere amalgam of elements , but contain a particular organization of these . For example , when the Greek language designates the moon as the measurer ' and the Latin language designates it as that which glitters ' , different intuitive concepts underline these different designations , but these concepts act in both cases only as a factor of comparison and correlation , only , that is , as a point of view . And , of course , points of view can be verified or superseded . It is in this sense that Cassirer sees that concept as essentially predictive , not reproductive . A concept is not so much a reproduction of reality , an established path , along which thought proceeds , as a capacity for discovering new paths ; a concept does not provide a fixed and ready answer but only really establishes a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a certain point of view is wrong ; if , for example , certain languages designate the butterfly as a bird , focusing only on the point of view of flying , when other criteria become available through advances in zoology the original point of view will be superseded since it can now be replaced by one with a more complete meaning . This highlights the fact that there is no essential difference between the construction of everydayp113and the construction of scientific concepts . All concepts are hypotheses , capable of validation or invalidation . Cassirer 's ( 1953a ) statement that all construction of concepts is connected with some definite form of construction of series ' ( p. 15 ) offers a formula which relates to the many different types of concept . The theory of abstraction ostensibly worked most effectively with concepts of concrete things , like tables and donkeys , but had great difficulty in accounting for logical and mathematical concepts . The weakness of the theory results from the fact that the only logical principle of order which the theory recognizes is the principle of similarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reduced to this . Cassirer 's theory of the concept , however , makes it clear that a series of stimuli can be arranged according to the most diverse points of view , providing that the guiding point of view is maintained unaltered throughout the construction of the series : Thus side by side with series of similars in whose individual members a common element uniformly recurs , we may place series in which between each member and the succeeding member there prevails a certain degree of difference . Thus we can conceive members of series ordered according to equality or inequality , number and magnitude , spatial and temporal relations , or causal dependence . The relation of necessity thus produced is in each case decisive ; the concept is merely the expression and husk of it ... . ( Cassirer , 1953a , p. 16 ) IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONCEPT LEARNINGThese criticisms make it apparent that the principle of abstraction can not account for the formation of even the simplest concepts and that there is no justification for retaining it in any psychological explanation of concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the principle of association . H. H. Kendler ( 1964 ) listed three properties of concepts implied by the mediational model : they are associations , cues and responses . But this list omits the most important property of concepts , namely , the fact that they are particular organizations of objects and events . The principle of association , as it has been pointed out on numerous occasions ( see , for example , Humphrey , 1963 ) , can not itself account for the organized nature of thinking : we can and do distinguish between fortuitous associations and organized thinking . If the concept is , as Cassirer says , an expression of a particular way of organizing elements , then associationism is quite powerless to explain the concept.  |p114The  many experiments which demonstrate that subjects can be conditioned to associate certain stimuli with a particular response are not , therefore , answering the central question in the study of concept formation ? the way in which elements become organized and thus distinct from chance associations . The recognition of this difficulty may be the cause of Heidbreder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical construct capable of interpersonal use ' and that , so defined , concepts are obviously not the subject matter investigated in psychological research ' . How experiments , in which the experimenter merely makes use of concepts that are not the subject-matter for experimentation , can hope to clarify our understanding of the attainmentof such concepts , seems to be a paradox not fully appreciated by Heidbreder . These considerations also show the ambiguities in the definition of the concept as a common response to dissimilar stimuli ' . On the one hand , if stimuli are , in fact , dissimilar , any classifications of them that are achieved reflect the existence of different points of view or organizations , and it is therefore false to refer to these organizations merely as responses ' which happen to become associated with a variety of stimuli . On the other hand , if it is maintained that there are , in some cases at least , resemblances between stimuli , which , when recognized , serve as the basis for classification and concept formation , then it is mistaken to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstraction , we have noted , are distinguished by their conflicting accounts of the relationship between perception and thinking , the traditional theory assuming that concepts are formed when particular sensations are organized in thought , whereas the more recent theory affirms that thinking elaborates the forms of organization gained in perception . That this issue remains of fundamental importance may be judged from the controversy in contemporary theory and researchover the importance of mediation in concept learning . Stated in its broadest terms , this controversy has to do with the relative weight to be attached to organization at the perceptual level ( the viewpoint of differentiation theory ) as against organization attributable to other variables ( verbal or attentional mediation ) that intervene between stimulus and response . Deductions from these alternative theories have been tested mainly in concept-shift situations , in which the subject learns one concept and is then required to learn another , but research on transposition and oddity learning is also relevant . A review of these theories and this research is essential , since , having accepted Cassirer 's notion that the formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of series , it is necessary now to describe the mechanisms responsible for this construction , which means , precisely , accounting for the relationship between percepts and concepts . THEORIES OF CONCEPT-SHIFT BEHAVIOURThe three theories agree in asserting that concepts are formed through the organism learning to discriminate between stimuli and to attach different responses to different sets of stimuli . They disagree over the nature of the processes responsible for such **32;2827;TOOLONG , this disagreement being most evident in their interpretationsof concept-shift behaviour . The two major types of concept shift are intradimensional ( ID ) and extradimensional ( ED ) shifts . In both types , there is an initial phase , in which the subject learns a concept to a criterion , and a second phase , in which the subject has to learn a new concept , the cues for which are either along the rewarded dimension of the original concept ( ID shift ) or along another dimension , usually the one irrelevant in theFigure 2 . Illustration of concept-shift paradigms. original learning ( ED shift ) . The second phase of the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed of the changes in the task requirements . Figure 2 illustrates the major forms of concept shift for a task involving shape and brightness dimensions . For human adults the task is to sort a series of cards correctly into two categories ; after each response the experimenter indicates whether the subject was right or wrong . For young children and animals the task takes essentially the same form as for human adults except that the correct response is rewarded with a different kind of stimulus ( food or something that children regard , as a desirable possession , say , marbles ) .  |p117In  the example illustrated in Figure 2 , the initial task requires subjects to choose cards with dark figures irrespective of shape . The reversal shift ( one form of ID shift ) requires the choice of the opposite value on the same dimension , that is , bright figures irrespective of shape . A second kind of ID shift , likewise , entails the subject responding to bright figures irrespective of shape but is characterized by the introduction of new shapes . In an ED shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the previously irrelevant dimension , shape , becomes relevant , the subject having to choose square rather than circular figures irrespective of brightness . The basic design , devised by Buss ( 1953 ) , allows a comparison of the relative difficulty of reversal and ED shifts . Wolff 's ( 1967 ) review contains an account of the variations on this design . In an optional shift paradigm there are two phases after the original concept learning . In the shift discrimination phase only one pair of stimuli is presented : the previously negative stimulus becomes positive and the previously positive stimulus becomes negative ; this means , in our example , that the subject can learn the shift by responding to shape ( the circle ) or to brightness or to both . The test phase involves rewardingresponses to both of the stimuli that did not appear in the shift discrimination phase whilst maintaining the same pattern of reinforcementfor the pair presented in the shift discrimination . If the bulk of the subject 's responses in the test phase is to the stimulus that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classified as a reverser ; for example , if the subject responded to the bright square in the test pair , it is inferred that he learned the shift discrimination by shifting from dark to bright figures ? a reversal response . If , on the other hand , the subject made more responses to the stimulus that had been irrelevant in the original learning , it would be inferred that he had learned the shift discrimination by responding to shape ? an ED response . A third category of subjects contains those whose choices on the test series are inconsistent . The optional shift design was introduced by Kendler , Kendler and Learnard ( 1962 ) . Developmental Mediation TheoryKendler and Kendler ( 1962 ) have formulated a theory which postulates developmental differences in concept learning attributable to the development of mediational processes . Two developmental levels are assumed . At the first , the organism is said to respond to stimuli directly ; a single-link S-R model applies to this kind of behaviour , which , it is argued , is the only kind available to animals and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also able to respond to stimuli produced by its own responses ; it is necessary , therefore , to postulate a mediational model , S-r-s-R , in which the implicit response , r , is assumed to modify the external stimulus to produce a transformed stimulus , s , that elicits behaviour . Although the trend of the Kendlers ' theory appears to suggest that these mediational processes are mainly verbal , they do not discount other forms of mediation , for example , imagery . But , whatever the nature of this mediation may be , it leads to a higher level of cognitive functioning , since the existence of a symbolic system reduces the organism 's dependence upon fluctuations in the environment . Because the effective stimulus is the mediational , rather than the direct , stimulus , behaviour , including conceptual behaviour , becomes both more flexible and more stable . One consequence of the theory is the need to formulate a developmentalaccount of concept-shift behaviour . It is predicted that the difficulty of ID and ED shifts is a function of the presence or absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift easier , since , having learned to respond to one end of a dimension , e.g. brightness , the habit strength of this response will interfere more with the learning of the reverse concept , darkness , than it will with the learning of a new S-R connection , e.g. responding to shape . The mediational organism , on the other hand , should execute ID shifts more rapidly than ED shifts , since the former enable him to utilize the same mediated response to a new overt response ( e.g. bright ? dark ' ) , whereas the latter requires the acquisition of a new mediated response ( shape ) to a new overt response . One source of ambiguity in this formulation relates to the assumption that the rates at which overt and mediational responses weaken or extinguish are different . H. H. and T. S. Kendler ( 1966 ) , in reply to Mackintosh ( 1965 ) , agree that the relevant assumption is to postulate that mediated responses extinguish more slowly than overt responses , since the subject can only utilize the same mediated response if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses are extinguished . But , the Kendlers argue , if differential extinction were the only factor , it would be expected that a reversal would occur once a subject shifted his overt response . This does not always happen , for there are cases in which the subject chooses an overt response consistent with a reversal shift , yet does not begin to reverse . The suggested absence of the mediated response in this case makes it strategic to consider the hierarchy of mediated responses available to the subject in addition to the relative rates of extinction of mediated and overt responses.  |p119Attentional  Mediation TheoryAn alternative conception of discrimination learning is that the organism learns to make two responses , an attentional response to the relevant stimulus dimension followed by an instrumental response . Spence ( 1940 ) found it necessary to talk of a receptor-orienting ' response in addition to instrumental responses , and Wyckoff ( 1952 ) demonstrated the observing response ' in pigeons by requiring them to execute two responses to obtain reward : the animal had to depress a pedal to illuminate a key ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of two colours appeared ( the instrumental response ) . Attentional models of discrimination learning have adopted these ideas but emphasize that attention selects between stimulus dimensions and not between stimulus objects ( Zeaman and House , 1963 ; Mackintosh , 1965 ) . In the Zeaman and House model a dimension is defined to include stimulus compounds , such as black-tall ' or white-short ' , in addition to the component dimensions like colour and size . It is argued that , since at the beginning of learning the stimulus dimensions present in the situation compete for attention , the subject must learn both to attend to the relevant dimension and to attach an instrumental response of approach or avoidance to the cues along that dimension . In this model , the mediational response is therefore the attending response which serves the function of increasing the probability that only relevant stimuli control the instrumental response . The theory has a number of implications when applied to conceptshiftbehaviour . Of the two ID shifts , it is predicted that the one involving new stimuli along the same dimension will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects in the latter conditionhave the advantage of looking at the relevant cues , they also have the disadvantage of a strong tendency to pick up the wrong one . The reversal shift may or may not be easier than ED shifts , for , although subjects in an ED shift may have the initial disadvantage of attending to irrelevant cues , they do not have the reverser 's disadvantage of a strong habit to pick up the negative stimulus . The superiority of one or the other is thus dependent upon the nature of the situation and the subjects ; exact predictions can be made by assigning weights to observing and instrumental responses . However , it is clear that an ID shift with new stimuli should be easier to learn than an ED shift . Finally , any experience that strengthens attention to the relevant dimension , such as overtraining , will facilitate reversal learning when the attentional responseis relatively less well established than the instrumental response.
