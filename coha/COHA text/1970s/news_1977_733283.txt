txt CIRCUIT JUDGE Francis Delaney on Wednesday ordered 270 veteran Chicago public school teachers  --  transferred to promote faculty desegregation  --  returned to their original schools , and branded the annual late summer disputes between the school board and teachers union " a joke . " Delaney acted on a class-action suit by the Chicago Teachers Union on behalf of the teachers , charging that their seniority was violated by the involuntary transfers and that they were not allowed to pick their new assignments from available vacancies . The judge 's order ( lees not affect most of the more than 2,000 teachers transferred under the Board of Education 's faculty-desegregation plan . Teachers affected constitute a special group notified as late as August that they were being transferred and who , under board rules , had greater seniority than some teachers not transferred . THE JUDGE 'S order also does not affect the current pupil-desegregation plan , which . has prompted demonstrations at some schools since classes began . Delaney criticized the school board and the union , saying , " I , want you to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August and September . This is getting to be a joke , starting all this trouble in late August or early September . I 'm getting tired of it . " The judge ordered the 270 teachers sent back to their original schools because he said not enough testimony had been offered by the school board about the racial makeup of the schools teachers were leaving and those to which they were being sent . THE JUDGE , vim issued the order in the form of a preliminary injunction , also said not enough clear testimony was offered on what the board 's goals were in the teacher transfers and whether the union 's contract with the board would be violated by the transfers . School board attorney Donald Duffy // Judge voids teacher bias transfers // said Delaney 's ruling means that 500 to GOO teachers , including the 270 , must be reassigned . Returning the teachers to their original schools , where their jobs have for the most part been eliminated , would put other teachers with lower seniority out of jobs . These teachers , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healey , president of the teachers union , Win said teacher reassignment procedures was one of the stumbling blocks in current contract negotiations , demanded that the board begin reassigning the 270 teachers to their original schools immediately . IIEALEY SAID the school board discovered in midsummer that it was 270 teachers short of its desegregation reassignment goal and decided to violate these teachers ' seniority rights and pick them solely on the basis of race . Healey had contended in several days of hearings that the board not only violated its contract with the union , but had violated a rule requiring a twothirds vote of its members before a contract provision can be set aside . He said the board had taken no such vote . Duffy had argued that reassignment of teachers was an administrative right and that the constitutional rights of students to a good education were superior to a collective-bargaining contract . He argued that reassignment at this point would be unsettling to the students affected .                    @
