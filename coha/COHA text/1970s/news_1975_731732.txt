The 14 , members of the Oil , Chemical , and Atomic Workers Union , were released on their own recognizance and are scheduled to appear Wednesday on contempt of court charges . All were arrested at the plant 's main gate . Meanwhile , In Denver , OCAW negotiators said they would strike Amoco , the nation 's third largest refiner , if a new contract is not settled by midnight Wednesday . THE ORDER limiting the picketing at the Lockport refinery has been issued by Will County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Vinson , who said that no more than five pickets could be at any one gate .
