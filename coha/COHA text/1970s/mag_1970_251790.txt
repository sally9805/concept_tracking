COSMOS by Witold Gombrowicz. 166 pages . Grove . $5 . <P> It 's berging . Berging with my bamberg with all the bambergity of my bamberg . <P> Berging or , just possibly , Bunburying . It is 70 years since John Worthing went Bunburying in Wilde 's comic masterpiece , The Importance of Being Earnest . Onstage , Bunburying is such a mischievous male lark that , as Auden puts it , " Whenever I see or read the play , I always wish I did not know what I do about Wilde 's life at the time he was writing it . " Bunburying was shorthand for a visit to a fashionable London male whorehouse , and Bunburying , or berging-the disguise of homosexual material in literature-is still a common phenomenon in this outspoken age . <P> It is also easy to spot : the voyeurs , the bitchy domestic debaters , the dealers in rites and perversions are often stand-ins for unexpressed sexuality . <P> One of the more skilled practitioners of the sexual shell game was Witold Gombrowicz , a Polish writer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to the world . He died at 64 in France last year , after enjoying a muffled underground explosion of fame . Cosmos won the $20,000 International Prize for Literature . It is an achingly attenuated suspense story - except that it turns out that there is no object to the chase , no rich cache of contraband drugs , no key diplomatic documents and no blondes . Just a hanged sparrow , a hanged cat , a mysterious bit of wood suspended in a shed and , finally , a hanged man whose death is as meaningless as the cat 's . <P> The discoverer of these pitiful carcasses is Witold , a dour , perfervid student who , with an equally jittery friend , has decided to board in the country while studying for exams . They tramp along a road in stifling heat until they encounter the hanged sparrow . As if it were a signal , they check into the next house with a guest sign . There are no other guests , only a retired bank manager named Leo Wojtys , his wife , his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , a deformed servant . <P> Spontaneous Combustion . The neurasthenic students sit through stultifying dinners and spend the rest of their time finding unsettling " clues . " But to what ? Though the final horror is forestalled , the psychic answer comes halfway through the book . Upset by noises and " arrows " that he thinks he sees in the ceiling cracks , Witold goes out at night , climbs a tree in the front yard and watches the daughter and her husband preparing for bed . On his way back to his room , he strangles and hangs her cat . <P> The household is aghast , but it is fair to assume that one member is not mystified at all . Shortly afterward , Leo corners Witold and lets him know that he is quite aware of the young man 's obsession with his daughter-and quite satisfied . As it happens , behind his cherished respectability he himself has led a secret phantasy life . " Bergtitbits and bergpenalties awarded by the High Court , " he crows . " Bergpunishments inflicted by the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delights . "
