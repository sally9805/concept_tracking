SINCE the Middle East cease-fire went into force last August , Israel has enjoyed a rare interregnum of peace . Thus it came as a shock to Israelis when Premier Golda Meir recently warned them to brace for quite another kind of war , " an internal war that would be rooted in social problems and would be more frightening than any war on the borders . " Israel 's Premier was alerting her 3,000,000 citizens to domestic crises that have been deliberately set aside during the 23 years since independence , while Israel concentrated on securing its borders . Now , with the cease-fire ten months old and holding , the first skirmishes are being fought in the internal war that Golda prophesied . <P> Much of the difficulty grows out of the fact that Israel is not really one Jewish nation but an uncertain amalgam of Ashkenazic ( European ) and Sephardic ( Oriental ) Jews . The Sephardim ( literally " Spaniards , " though most are from North Africa or Asia ) represent almost 65% of the Jewish population . The generally better-educated Ashkenazim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them descendants of the Polish and Russian Jews who founded Israel , rule the country . The Sephardim feel discriminated against because of their cultural shortcomings . Only 3% of all top government officials and 20% of the Knesset , or Parliament , are Sephardim . In the 18-man Cabinet , only Iraqi-born Police Minister Shlomo Hillel is from an Arab-speaking country . Fully 60% of Sephardic children drop out of high school ; at the college level , 95% of the student population are Ashkenazim . <P> Such statistics invite a protest movement , and it fell to a long-haired , slim , intense youth named Saadya Marciano , 20 , to organize it . Born in Marseille while his wandering father was in transit from Morocco to Israel , Saadya is one of nine children and a product of a Jerusalem slum called Musrara . He entered the army at 18 , spent nearly half his seven months of service in jail , and was finally discharged as unfit . Since then , unable to get a job because of his service record , he has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has been picked up by police on suspicion of various crimes . <P> " One night , " Saadya told TIME Correspondent Marlin Levin last week , " we were sitting around in the room of my friend Charley Biton when we decided to form an organization . I suggested the name Black Panthers . We asked the police for a permit to demonstrate against lousy housing conditions . The police helped us a lot : they locked us up when we said we were going to demonstrate without a permit . " <P> The demonstration was held anyway earlier this spring and , though police soon broke it up , Israelis were jolted by the sight of Jew fighting Jew . Since the first protest , the Panthers ( " Madison Avenue could n't have picked a better name , " says Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek ) claim that they have signed up 9,000 members . <P> Three Fronts . The Panthers have helped spark a long-overdue debate in Israel on the problems that bloom with peace . It was Police Minister Hillel , the Iraqi Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Tel Aviv recently , he told a Labor Party rally : " Israel is faced with a struggle on three equally important fronts-security , economic and social . It can not afford to lose any one of them .
