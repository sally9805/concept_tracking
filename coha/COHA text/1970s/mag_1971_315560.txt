The world airline industry , bound to gether in the 108-member International Air Transport Association , has been setting air fares for the past 26 years with only an occasional break in its faade of comfortable unanimity . All that will likely end this week . West Germany 's Lufthansa has been the sole holdout against a new scale of North Atlantic air fares , and IATA has given the " Route of the Red Baron " until Sept. 1 to go along . If , as expected , Lufthansa refuses to reconsider , IATA members will be without a common rate package . <P> The resulting every-man-for-himself situation will probably lead to lower fares , but few airline men are willing to guess how soon or how low . The first move will probably be made by Lufthansa itself . The line has already dis closed plans for a 14-to 60-day excursion fare of about $210 round trip between New York and Frankfurt , v. $442 now for 17 to 28 days and $372 for a 29-to 45-day ticket . The fare would apply to passengers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lufthansa and a number of other lines introduced earlier this year . Britain 's BOAC may counter with a January-to-March fare of about $150 round trip between New York and London . Other foreign carriers are working out their own open-rate fares , but will probably wait for a move by Lufthansa- and for the new confusion over exchange rates to subside- before announcing them . <P> Faster Cash . In the end , the new fares will probably turn out to be similar to those in the IATA plan rejected by Lufthansa . That arrangement , worked out by IATA representatives in Montreal this summer while pickets protested their secret meetings , came after members began underpricing each other with youth fares . It calls for retention of the student prices for ages 12 to 21 and introduction of an advance-purchase excursion plan . Under APEX , as the ar rangement is called , passengers who buy their tickets 90 days ahead of time would receive substantial fare reductions . Lufthansa considered APEX to be " too expensive to administer and too difficult to police , " as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're against overcomplicating the situation . " Nevertheless , Pan Am , TWA and BOAC may go ahead with APEX fares- partly in order to get sorely needed cash into their coffers earlier than they could otherwise . <P> Some IATA members cling to the hope that a compromise can be reached before transatlantic chaos sets in . Says Fabrizio Serena , a deputy director gen eral of Alitalia : " Lufthansa has been making noises to the effect that it might possibly review its position if the rest of us make some move toward them . " If they come at all , conciliatory moves will probably be made next week , when IATA members meet in Miami to dis cuss fares to Asia and Latin America .
