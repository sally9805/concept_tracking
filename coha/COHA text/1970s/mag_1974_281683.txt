This week TIME 'S Nation section carries two wide-ranging interviews , one with Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski , the other with Vice President-Designate Nelson Rockefeller . The World section contains an extended interview with Constantino Caramanlis - one of the first that Greece 's Premier has given to an American journalist since the military junta resigned under pressure last July . In recent weeks TIME has run interviews with a host of world figures , including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing , West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat and Polish Communist Party Boss Edward Gierek . <P> In the normal course of a week 's work , TIME correspondents may talk to sources ranging from telepaths to TV stars , such as Cover Subjects Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper . But interviews with leading political and diplomatic figures often pose unique problems ; many demand written questions in advance as well as the right to edit their own statements . Even security can be an obstacle . After elaborate negotiations , Beirut Bureau Chief Karsten Prager was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization , through the twisting streets of Lebanon 's capital in a guerrilla staff car . Prager met Arafat in a modest flat in a nondescript apartment building guarded by fedayeen armed with Soviet AK-47 assault rifles . <P> Paris Correspondent George Taber has interviewed French President Giscard three times in the past fifteen months-including one mid-air talk on Giscard 's campaign plane . <P> Taber reports that Giscard , an avid and critical reader of the magazine , attacks transcripts of his talks with a green felt-tipped pen - and a precise feel for English nuance . Giscard 's editing affected the stylistic polish of his answers but not their substance , and what the French President said proved to be of more than usual interest to his countrymen . His remarks in a recent interview with Taber , Time Inc . Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan and Chief European Correspondent William Rademaekers ( TIME , Oct. 7 ) were widely reported and analyzed by the French radio and press . Such scrutiny is partly due to the inaccessibility of foreign leaders . And , as Correspondent Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for World 's story on Portugal notes : " No national leader chats with journalists for desultory and innocuous reasons . All have a message to convey , and often they see TIME as their vehicle . "
