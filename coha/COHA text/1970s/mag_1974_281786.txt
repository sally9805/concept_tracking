LADY by THOMAS TRYON 341 pages . Knopf. $7.95 . <P> <P> Welcome to Pequot Landing , folks . <P> Another genuine New England town put up by that ex-movie-actor fella , Mr. <P> Tryon . We local extras like to think our little community is a far sight nicer place to live than those boom villages Mr. Try-on built for The Other and Harvest Home . No weird twins up to supernatural devilment here , nosir , and no mythical human sacrifices either . Oh , we 've had our odd sexual fandangos , if you get my drift , but if that 's all you 're after , you 'll want to head on over to Peyton Place . Lots more action there . <P> Not that we 're completely dull , mind you . See that brick house yonder off the village green ? That belonged to Mrs. <P> Adelaide Harleigh . She and Mr. Tryon demanded that all of us call her " Lady . " <P> Her husband died not too long after being gassed in World War I , and Lady spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow . Late in her life she won the New England regional " forlorn cry " award , popular-novel division : " Oh , I am a vain and foolish woman . Yes , foolish . I have wanted the esteem of the world , and why ? Tell me , for what ? " <P> Little Nipper . We would n't have known much about Lady if it had n't been for that little nipper " Woody " Woodhouse who lived across the green from Lady . Woody was eight when he first took a shine to her . But he was the one Mr. Tryon chose to tell Lady 's secret story , and as time went by he sure was a burden on her and the rest of us . Always digging into her closets and chifforobes , eavesdropping and peeking into folks ' windows . More than a few of us wanted to dump him in our picturesque river , but he had Mr. Tryon 's license to snoop so we could n't lay a hand on him . <P> Some of the townspeople think that Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth . It was , after all , only a case of the butler 's doing it . Over the years , whenever Lady felt bad or Woody was hot on a new clue , you could count on the rest of us catching grief . To dramatize such things , Mr. Tryon scheduled a hurricane , a flood and the Dutch elm disease . Not to mention yearly blizzards of cliches . But the wisdom that Lady revealed to Woody strikes some people as priceless . " Man is made to suffer , they say , " she once opined . On another of many " memorable " occasions , she tossed off one of her best remarks : " People are people wherever you go . " No , they do n't make ' em like Lady any more . <P> Have n't for a long time , in fact , and thanks for dropping by .
