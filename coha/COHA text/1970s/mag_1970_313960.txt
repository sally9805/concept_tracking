As college and university administrators await the return of most students this week , their apprehension turns less on the almost certain resumption of protest than on the possibility of terrorist violence . The worst such incident to date , last month 's bombing of the mathematics research center at the University of Wisconsin , left a badly demoralized campus amid the rubble . To assess the implications of that bitter event for academic institutions elsewhere , TIME Correspondent Gregory Wierzynski visited the university and sent this report : <P> So many shattered windows in nearby buildings are now boarded up that one high administration official ruefully calls the institution " Old Plywood U. " Nevertheless , the administrators ironically find comfort in the bombing . They believe that it is the peak of long years of frustration that began with the Dow Chemical demonstrations in 1967 . The revulsion it will cause among students and faculty , they think , may help reforge understanding between them . <P> This will not halt the violence on campus , which officials feel represents the acts of a desperate fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the crazies from drumming up support for massive disruptions . Says Chancellor Edwin Young : " I expect more violence this year , but from fewer people . " <P> That is small cheer . The student body has grown highly cynical . Says Anatole Beck , an activist professor : " The kids do n't believe anything any more . The skepticism about ever ending the war is everywhere . " <P> Cynicism and disillusionment with academic life go far beyond politics . Last year cheating reached epidemic proportions . Weary of the poisonous atmosphere , many students have moved into apartments or to outlying farm areas . There they have set up communes and cooperatives to experiment with a more constructive and calmer lifestyle . <P> Departing Professors . Out of fear and weariness , the faculty has lost much of its zest for teaching . Says Hugh Richards , the 51-year-old acting chairman of the physics department : " I guess what depresses me most is that some of my colleagues are taking a second look at whether academic life is where they can make the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty members are resentful of what they consider the administration 's heavyhanded tactics during the past year . Nineteen professors had their pay docked , for instance , because they did not hold classes during the days of protest following the U.S. incursion into Cambodia . <P> More and more , professors have been leaving the campus immediately after their classes end each day . Many have taken leaves of absence to wait out the current year . Others have left for other universities and more would follow if there were not so few places to go . Less prestigious institutions have little appeal ; more prestigious ones have tensions that often are just as bad .
