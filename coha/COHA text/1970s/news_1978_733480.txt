A24 Letters Canal Treaties : Understated U.S. Disadvantages The Military Pension Pitfall To the Editor : Your Jan. 28 editorial " Beyond the Panama Treaties " asserts that there is in the treaties a provision that " would oblige the United States to build any new sea-level canal in Panama and oblige Panama to allow only the United States to build one . " I believe that the quoted statement is incomplete and therefore ? misleading , and indeed essentially incorrect , just as is the closely similar statement in the article of Adam Clymer on the subject in The Times of Jan. 26 . As I read the Panama Canal Treaty , it forbids the United States to construct , prior to the year 2000 , an interoceanic canal of either the sea-level or lock type anywhere in the Western Hemisphere outside Panama except with Panama 's consent . Under paragraph 1 of Article XII , Panama and the United States commit themselves to study , prior to the year 2000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they agree as to the necessity of such a canal , to negotiate terms agreeable to both parties for its construction . Under paragraph 2(a) of this Article XII , no new interoceanic canal is to be constructed prior to 2000 in the territory of the Republic of Panama except in accordance with the provisions of the Panama Canal Treaty , or To the Editor . It was more than a little disconcerting to read the recent Op-Ed article of Milton Rector , president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency , in which he laments the building of a prison on the site of the Olympic dormitories at Lake Placid . He would prefer a training camp for athletes . So would I. But what are we to do with the thousands of individuals who rob , rape , maim and murder ? The increase in these crimes has torn apart the very fabric of our society and produced hundreds of thousands of innocent , physically and emotionally scarred victims of crime , and families bereft of their loved ones . Reports from the most benign of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most progressive prison systems in the world have not prevented released criminals from returning to crime in a most depressing level of recidivism . We live in a mea culpa society , in which we blame ourselves for every crime , and ir , this mood of guilt we both excuse the crime and indirectly encourage its repetition . Recent statistics in New York City have revealed that youthful muggers each commit as many as 400 attacks upon elderly people . Civil libertarians , including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Marston Mover To the Editor : One reads continually critical commentaries about President Carter and Attorney General Griffin B. Bell in connection with the firing of U.S. Attorney David W. Marston  --  but not a word of criticism about Representative Joshua Eilberg , who urged the dismissal of Marston while knowing that he was being investigated by him . There can be hardly any doubt that this action of Eilberg is highly immoral and should be condemned in the first nlace . RICHARD GIBIAN Forest Hills , N.Y. , Jan 31 , 1978 To the Editor : Your Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , overstating real military pensions . In the interest of accurate reporting , will you please re-examine the facts and correct the erroneous impression given your readers . The existing military pension system contains a pitfall that traps most observers , including The Times . Active duty military pay is not a simple salary system but rather a complex combination of ingredients that include a basic rate plus a variable number of allowances based on such factors as marital status and whether one lives in military quarters or civilian housing . Military pensions are not a percentage of the active duty paycheck . Instead , the pension is a percentage of only one part of the paycheck  --  the basic pay . After 20 years , military retirees draw 50 percent of their basic pay only  --  not 50 percent of the active duty paycheck on which they had been living . In my case , my real retirement pay would be about 41 percent of my active duty pay . Additionally , I suggest you examine the adequacy of some of the allowances that are ingredients in the paycheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins with a basic pay computed as if the Government provided the food and shelter . If there are no quarters and the soldier lives off-post in the civilian community , the pay system provides subsistence and quarters allowances in lieu of Government-provided meals , quarters and utilities . The Government as the two parties , the United States and Panama , may otherwise agree . In conjunction with paragraph 1 of Article XII , this seems to mean that , except as the two parties may " otherwise agree , " no new ? interoceanic canal is to be constructed in Panama prior to the year 2000 except the sealevel canal referred to in paragraph 1 . The important clause for present purposes , however , is paragraph 2(b) of Article XII , which provides that the United States shall not , prior to 2000 , even negotiate with third states for the right to construct an interoceanic canal of any type anywhere in the Western Hemisphere except in Panama , and , again , except as the two parties may otherwise agree . The upshot is that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment which the United States would be making in accepting the treaties , even if the Neutrality Treaty is somehow " amended " to incorporate the undated and unsigned TorrijosCarter statement released by the White House last Oct. 14 . You have thereby understated the costs and disadvantages of the treaties to the United States , and this whether or not there now appears to be ? any probability that a lock-type canal outside Panamanian territory might be worthwhile . Paragraph 2(b) of Article XII is by the way badly drafted . It provides that // Jo Teodorescu courts , have encouraged the concept of unrestricted individual freedom , which is interpreted by many as the right to do whatever they feel like . Freedom without responsibility encourages anarchy , and those people who lose control of themselves need the external controls provided by the police , the courts and by prisons . The United States is far from a perfect country , but it is much more perfect than most that exist today or have ever existed in previous centuries . For Mr. Rector to compare our prison system to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin would find amusing . And he almost never smiled . IRA L. MINTZ Englewood , N. J. , Jan. 31 , 1978 What Fascists Want To the Editor : Will the American Civil Liberties Union defend the neo-Nazis of Skokie , Ill. , if they break up a meeting of peorile who protest the Illinois court decision which allows the neo-Nazis to parade in this predominantly Jewish community ? To defend democracy abstractly and let those who would destroy it go free is just what fascists need and want . Such decisions concerning the fascist movement allowed Hitlerism to grow in Germany . It must not hannen here . FRANK L. ASHER Southbury , Conn. , Jan. 30 , 1973 pays me a subsistence allowance of $59.53 monthly to cover my entire food costs . Similarly , it pays me a quarters allowance of $338.10 , My actual cost , however , for an average three-bedroom home 16 miles from the Pentagon exceeds $700 per month for interest , taxes , maintenance , insurance and utilities , or at least $360 per month more than the Government allowance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computing pensions , these so-called allowances frequently fall far short of the costs they are intended to cover . THOMAS A. LASER Lieutenant Colonel , U.S.A.F. Springfield , Va. , Jan. 29 , 1978 until the year 2000 " the United States of America shall not negotiate with third States for the right to construct an interoceanic canal on any other route in the Western Hemisphere except as the two Parties may otherwise agree " ( emphasis supplied ) . Other than what ? I believe that there is no antecedent to this phrase , and that one is driven to infer that the reference is to any route other than that of the sealevel canal of paragraph 1 . It is , however , distressing to find such obscurities in a document of this importance . J. PHILIP ANDEREGG Forest Hills , N.Y. , Jan. 28 , 1978 Carter 's ' Cover-Up ' To the Editor : I have just returned from a twoweek trip to the West Indies and visited Antigua and Nevis and read the local newspapers from Trinidad and Antigua . I discussed with many people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of their lives in the West ' Indies , what would happen if we gave up the Panama Canal to the Marxist Communist regime in Panama . They all stated it would be disastrous and turn independent nations such as Jamaica . British Guinea and possibly Trinidad toward Communist governments . The Soviet influence would rapidly extend throughout Central America and Venezuela , Colombia and Mexico . I listened with amazement to the television speech of President Carter , who completely ignored the fact that Panama is dominated by a Marxist Communist dictatorship which permits neither freedom of speech , nor the press , nor human rights andis virtually an axis to Cuba and the Soviet Union . This is the same man who , as a candidate for President , stated : " I will never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal . " The American people are entitled to know the truth instead of listening to a carefully prepared cover-up avoiding the determined policy of the Soviet Union to encircle and surround the United States . President Carter 's Administration is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate effort to revive it . Ours is a government by the consent of the governed . Most polls show that 80 percent of the Republicans and two-thirds of the Democrats are opposed to this blackmail treaty , as are such nonpartisari organizations as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars , which are vitally concerned with the security of the nation . That is the main and real issue . Four former Chiefs of Naval Operations ( the highest post attainable in the U. S. Navy ) publicly declared : " Loss of the Panama Canal , .. would contribute to the encirclement of the U. S. by hostile naval forces , and threaten our ability to survive . " None of these are appointees of the President . Abraham Lincoln said : ' ' To sin by silence when you should protest , makes cowards of men . " The American people are not cowards . and have a right and a duty to protest when their own security is involved . HAMILTON FISH Newburgh , N.Y. , Feb. 2 , 1978 The writer was a U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the Editor : Despite the recent attention given the latest round of increases in Social Security taxes and the President 's proposed tax decreases , one ' important inequity has been overlooked . Because of differences in the way income taxes and Social Security taxes are imposed , the impact can be dramatically different on families where both spouses work as compared with families with only one wage earner . For example , for families with two children where each spouse earns $25,000 , Social Security taxes will increase $878 in 1979 over - 1977 ; the proposed tax decrease is only $80 . However , if only one spouse earns the entire income , Social Security taxes will increase by ( only ! ) $439 and income taxes will be reduced by the same $50 . Such an enormous differential could be justified if Social ' Security were like private pension plans , where benefits bear a rational relationship to contributions . With Social Security , however , the benefits for each family are roughly comparable . Thus , it seems that the President 's promise to make our tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family with two wage earners .
