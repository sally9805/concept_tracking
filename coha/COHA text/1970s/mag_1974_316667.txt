Within hours after a jury was selected and sequestered in the Watergate conspiracy trial last week , Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski submitted his resignation . During the eleven-month tenure of the courtly , mild-mannered Texan , 14 major Watergate defendants , twelve corporations and 17 corporate executives had been indicted or pleaded guilty . Jaworski 's dogged pursuit of Richard Nixon 's White House tapes had led to a unanimous Supreme Court decision in the prosecutor 's favor and , because of the contents of those tapes , finally to Nixon 's resignation . <P> With that record part of U.S. history and the conspiracy trial in the ca pable hands of an ace prosecutor , James Neal ( see THE LAW ) , Jaworski felt free to return , as he has long yearned , to his 800-acre horse ranch outside Houston and a $200,000-a-year law practice . As far as is known , there was no protest la tent in the tuning of his departure . He was not outraged by President Ford 's premature pardoning of Nixon , al though he would have argued against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted him . <P> Jaworski was especially emphatic on one point : he had no intention of challenging Ford 's right to pardon Nixon , since he was convinced of its legality . He said it would have been " intellectually dishonest " for him to have tried to overturn the pardon in court ; such " a spurious proceeding , " he added , would have amounted to " unprofessional conduct " on his part . Jaworski strongly urged that his top deputy , Henry S. ( Hank ) Ruth Jr. , be named his successor . Ruth , a quiet but effective attorney from Pennsylvania , had also served as deputy to the first special prosecutor , Archibald Cox , and had helped hold the staff together after Nixon ordered Cox fired last Oct. 20 . Jaworski said he will aid his successor in preparing a final report to the Congress ; if Congress so requests , the report will include a detailed account of Nixon 's Watergate involvement . <P> The Nixon pardon immensely complicated Federal Judge John J. Sirica 's task of selecting a jury in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.R. Haldeman , John Ehrlichman and John Mitchell . Defense attorneys often argue that pretrial publicity may prejudice jurors against their clients ; in this case , the pardon created sympathy for the defendants . Many prospective jurors expressed doubts that Nixon 's men should be convicted if their leader escaped trial . <P> Short Leash . Once the jury was chosen , Judge Sirica unsealed a number of previously submitted defense motions calling for Nixon 's testimony at the trial . In their motions , both Haldeman and Ehrlichman contended that they had urged Nixon , in unrecorded conversations , to tell the full truth of Watergate rather than conceal it . That runs counter to their prevailing advice as expressed in published White House tape transcripts . Sirica is expected to reveal this week what he intends to do about the claim of Nixon 's lawyers that he is too ill to testify . Sirica can appoint other doctors to examine the former President .
