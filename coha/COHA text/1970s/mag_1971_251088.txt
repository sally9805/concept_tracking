There was an ominous familiarity about the uprising in the maximum-security state prison at Rahway , N.J. Remember Attica , scrawled on a sheet fluttering from a cellblock window , was hardly necessary . However , 24 hours after Rahway inmates had seized four guards and the warden as hostages , the rebellion ended peacefully . At Attica , 43 inmates and hostages died during an assault on the prisoners ' stronghold ; after a negotiated settlement , the hostages at Rahway were released and prisoners returned quietly to their cells . <P> Throughout the fearful day , New Jersey officials and inmates alike gradually abandoned hard-line demands in favor of safety and compromise . Shortly after the rebellion started , New Jersey Governor William Cahill appeared , to direct negotiations from a nearby command post . The prisoners were not as well organized as the Attica inmates ; they were also less militant and inflexible in their demands . Both sides , it seems , remembered Attica . <P> Fifteen Demands .

" <P> Grievance Formula . On Thanksgiving Day , prisoners shouted demands for total amnesty ; that had been the principal obstacle to a settlement at Attica . They set fires inside the cellblock to dramatize their grievances . But behind the scenes , negotiations went on quietly . The armed assault was called off . Cahill 's presence , which the men inside the prison learned about from radio announcements , probably contributed to a swift and peaceful settlement . The Governor said later that he would have done whatever was possible to avoid bloodshed . " I probably would have gone in myself .
