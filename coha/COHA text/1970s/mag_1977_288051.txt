Debts to the U.S. and Europe are falling due <P> The nightmare of international finance is that less-developed , non-oil-producing countries will start defaulting on the enormous debts they owe to private banks-$42 billion to U.S. banks alone . Zare defaulted last year , but no panic followed , since the amounts were relatively small Now banks face a much worse threat : possible defaults soon by Turkey and Peru Says one prominent East Coast banker : " We are all worried . Were either Turkey or Peru to default , our exposure would make Zare 's total international debt of $800 million look like peanuts . " <P> In Turkey , politicians for two years or more have been drafting expansionist economic programs with an eye to winning future elections . The finance minister of a short-lived government warned in June that the country was " on the brink of bankruptcy . " Turkey has run up more than $3 billion in short-term debts of one kind or another . U.S. banks hold about half while West German and Swiss banks are also heavily committed . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe more than $1 billion for imports that have been received but not paid for . The remainder of the debt is the result of the Turkish Central Bank 's borrowing more than $2 billion abroad-at high interest rates on twelve-to 18-month terms-and then relending the money within Turkey to domestic industrialists starved for credit . Again , U.S. banks hold about half the loans . They estimate that $500 million worth are coming up for repayment every three months-and the government has , in total , no more than $600 million or so in foreign currencies to meet all its international obligations . Official Turkish figures put a better light on the situation ; they suggest that the country has reserves of $700 million to meet import debts of $300 million and deposit redemptions of $391 million over the next five months . Even by these calculations , the dangers are clear . <P> So far , most large U.S. banks insist that Turkey is somehow staying up to date in its repayments , but that apparently is because the nation is paying the biggest creditors while making others wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venema , senior vice president of the Wells Fargo Bank . Other bankers bitterly , though privately , insist that some repayments are months behind . Turkey owes many millions to Citibank , Chase Manhattan , Morgan Guaranty and other big banks . If all the debts were owed to such giants , the situation would not be so menacing . They are able , and might well be willing , to wait for repayments until Turkish exports , largely of tobacco and wheat , rebuild foreign currency reserves in late fall . But smaller banks rushed to make loans to Turkey because they could charge " front-end " fees of 6% to 10% in addition to high regular interest rates of 1% over the base London Interbank rate that has averaged about 6% . Total returns may have exceeded 12% a year . Bankers may or may not have realized that front-end fees are illegal in Turkey . Now big banks are concerned that a smaller bank may panic , insist on collecting debts that can not be repaid immediately , and touch off a string of defaults . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole house of cards down at a time when an International Monetary Fund team is about to go in to help the country restore its economic credibility .
