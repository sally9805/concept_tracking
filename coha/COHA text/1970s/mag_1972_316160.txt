There are two ancient Egyptians whose names everyone knows : Queen Nefertiti and her son-in-law King Tutankhamen . Nefertiti is a limestone bust , Tutankhamen a treasure . Nothing in his reign , which began around 1361 B.C. , when he was ten , and ended with his death at 18 , could have secured immortality for this shadowy boy-king . King Tut owes his fame to the accident that grave robbers never looted his tomb in Egypt 's Valley of the Kings . It remained intact until Nov. 26,1922 , when an English archaeologist named Howard Carter chipped through a door at the end of a rubble-filled passage and thrust a candle into the darkness beyond . " Do you see anything ? " asked Lord Carnarvon , his partner . " Yes , wonderful things , " Carter stuttered . <P> What he saw was a glimpse of the world 's most legendary treasure : the stupendous array of gold shrines , jewels , portrait masks , gilded pharaonic furniture and sarcophagi that had gone down with Tutankhamen into the dark . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eventually rehoused in the Cairo Museum . Parts of it made excursions to France , Japan and the U.S. Two weeks ago , the biggest collection of individual Tutankhamen objects - some 50 pieces-ever to leave Egypt went on display at the British Museum . <P> Unmarked Vans . No show in the staid B.M. 's history ever generated such fuss or demanded such elaborate preparation . First , a firm of English packers spent five weeks in Cairo crating the treasures-each wrapped in cellophane , encased in plastic quilts , set on a foam cushion tray and finally shut in a carpeted crate . The museum stepped up its security precautions . When this groundwork ( estimated cost : $900,000 ) had been done , the 41 crates were flown at night from Cairo in two BOAC freighters and one R.A.F. jet , then secretly whisked to the museum . Fearing hijackers , the English authorities took the extraordinary step of closing the M4 superhighway that links Heathrow to London until the unmarked vans had gone through . Such measures were compelled by the probable value of King Tut 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts speculate , is worth over $50 million . <P> The English , normally phlegmatic about art , greeted the event with ecstasies of Tutankhamenophilia . Tut appeared on posters , postcards , carrier bags and 56 million commemorative stamps ; the B.M. 's supply of replicas of Tutankhamen 's jewelry was sold out on the first day . Bottlenecks in the museum caused three-block queues outside it . The museum hopes that when the exhibit closes six months hence , 1.5 million people will have seen it . That would net about $1.3 million , most of it earmarked for a UNESCO fund to restore the temples on the island of Philae in Egypt , now submerged in the Nile by the Aswan High Dam .
