He has never been to a White House briefing or a presidential news conference . He does not entertain Cabinet officers at dinner parties or travel the chichi social circuit open to influential Washington journalists . He shuns the press clubs , including the one where other black newsmen meet . His beat is largely confined to a cluttered , windowless office just off the Washington Post 's news room and a vast network of telephone sources . Were it not for a slight resemblance to Comedian Flip Wilson and a penchant for wearing red plaid trousers , Columnist William Raspberry could do his work unnoticed , until another of his provocative articles appears . <P> That would be fine with him . He tries to live up to one colleague 's description of him : the Lone Ranger of columnists . <P> This personal independence is reflected in what he writes . As his growing number of readers* know , Raspberry has emerged as the most respected black voice on any white U.S. newspaper . Neither a Pollyanna nor a raging militant , he considers the merits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his judgments regularly nettle the Pollyannas and militants . <P> The latest example of Raspberry 's painstaking approach dealt with an explosive issue : the performance of students in Washington 's predominantly black public school system . Recent tests showed that local pupils are year by year falling farther behind the national norms in reading and math . The release of these findings brought charges-most notably from Barbara Sizemore , a dynamic black who is Washington 's new school superintendent-that the tests themselves are " culturally biased " against ghetto children . But Raspberry was dissatisfied with that familiar argument , calling it " a sort of cop-out . " <P> Persuaded that local schools must do better in teaching fundamentals , Raspberry devoted six successive columns to intelligence tests , presenting the views of D.C. teachers who agreed with his criticism as well as a rejoinder from Sizemore . He concluded last week that black parents-and the schools-must teach their children to pass standardized exams , which he called the " keepers of the gate " to better lives . <P> Such meticulous work may seem gritty and unassuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post page that features such stars as Joseph Alsop , Joseph Kraft , and Evans and Novak . Yet Raspberry 's strength rests precisely in the quiet , offbeat nature of his interests . Years of street experience have made Raspberry , 38 , an expert in three areas usually shunned by general columnists : education , criminal justice and drug abuse . <P> Though he favors integration , he has consistently opposed school busing to achieve racial balance , arguing that it is demeaning for blacks to be told that a proper education is impossible in black schools . " My recurring nightmare , " he says half jokingly , " has all the white people moving off to Alaska and all the black kids following them , with school buses strung out in a line all the way .
