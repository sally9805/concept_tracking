txt President Ford , his Vice-President , and his defense " chief urgently want the American people to force Congress to put full military and economic muscle behind the firm stand Mr. Ford took during his just-ended NATO visit to Western Europe . So important is it to the President to have Congress approve his military budget and his long-term energy proposals that he made a public appeal his first order of business after his jet landed back in Washington . Only after his speech to West Point graduates did he brief the Cabinet . Vice-President Nelson A. Rockefeller ( at Annapolis ) and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger ( at the Air Force Academy in Colorado ) confined themselves to the military side of the President 's appeal . The rationale of the Ford administration 's appeal is that the impression of leadership that the President considers the U.S. gave in Europe now must be supported by a strong defense budget ? and visible evidence that the U.S. is moving to reduce its dependence on oil whose price is set abroad . Hence Mr. Ford told West Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mutual defense and . . . progress . . . at the NATO summit . . . will be meaningless unless the industrial democracies have assured sources of energy to power both their economic and military efforts . " Mr. Ford added that " the price of sacrifice is far less than the price of failure . " As though in reassuring reply , the Senate almost simultaneously refused June 4 to cut $1.2 billion from the $30.3-billion military procurement and re Search bill . The senators voted 59 to 36 in what was , in effect , a vote of confidence in the President . Sen. John C. Stennis ( D ) of Mississippi , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , warned the legislators against reductions " at this critical time . " Congressional Democrats may , however , give Mr. Ford more trouble on energy . Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana said June 4 the President 's energy program places all of its emphasis on price-raising features and said that its implementation " would be disastrous . " He said low- and middle-income consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forbes , staff artist . . . and Schlesinger help * Ford asks voter help on defense // Democrats , on the other hand , have an energy program which " directs a surgical approach to the wasteful consumption of energy , " Senator Mansfield said , citing provisions for mandated improvements in auto efficiency and energy conservation standards for industry and housing . The triple message from the executive branch came as the Senate had just completed two days of debate on basic United States world strategy in preparation for consideration of the weapons procurement budget . - During the debate some senators wondered whether the massive U.S. defense budgets were preparing the nation to fight the wars of the past or those of the future . In particular it was noted that the Soviet Union has concentrated its growing forces on preparation for a short war of total effort , whereas the U.S. continues to prepare for a possible long war in Europe or Asia during which it would be necessary to maintain large armies and ocean convoys . President Ford mixed a report on his consultations with 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a message of uplift to the cadets . He said the United States found itself in " a unique position to help promote a solution " in the Middle East and meant to " make that effort . " " I believe , " the President said , that " the American people want a national defense posture second to none . . . . " Recalling the willingness of Thomas Jefferson and the congresses of his time to pay for the defense of freedom when America was still poor , he asserted : " I believe the Americans of 1975 are just as willing to pay that price . " Mr. Ford , Mr. Rockefeller , and Mr. Schlesinger all made the point that military costs were at their lowest point since the Korean War . The current budget request stands at $94 billion . " In 1964 , " Mr. Rocklefeller said , " prior to the Vietnam buildup , less than one-third of federal spending went for human resource programs ? and half the budget went for national defense . During the past decade that situation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows about one quarter for defense and over half going for domestic social programs . " Meanwhile , Dr. Schlesinger called for a rebirth of public morale to be expressed by the actions of the Congress .
