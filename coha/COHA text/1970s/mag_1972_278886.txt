Senator George McGovern 's surprising primary triumphs have left the Democratic Party somewhat divided , so McGovern Enthusiast Warren Beatty staged " Together with McGovern , " his fifth fund-raising extravaganza . At prices of $5 to $100 , some 20,000 people flocked to New York 's Madison Square Garden , to be ushered to their seats by such notables as Paul Newman , Shirley MacLaine and Julie Christie . But Beatty 's piece de resistance was the reunion of three split-up groups of stars : Peter , Paul and Mary , sounding as unified as ever ; Mike Nichols and Elaine May , delivering their own deadpan political satire ; and Simon and Garfunkel , re-creating Bridge over Troubled Water , which may be destined to become Senator McGovern 's campaign song . " We feel we are laboring at a disadvantage in comparison with other groups on this program , " Nichols remarked . " They quarreled viciously and broke up only a few months ago , but we have not spoken for twelve years . " <P> Roaring down a race track in Atlanta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump over four panel trucks , overshot the landing ramp , and broke his back-for the third time in his career . Determined to ride the next day , broken back and all , Knievel asked the doctor , " If I were to jump so I 'd land on the balls of my feet , not on my behind , so I would n't jar anything - what do you think ? " The doctor did n't think much of it , so Knievel set off for the track in an ambulance , just to make an appearance . Heckled into performing , he did a pair of " wheelies " - riding along for a hundred feet with the front wheel in the air . Said he : " I have to satisfy only one person and that 's the man I see in the mirror each morning . " <P> <P> Washington reporters , grumbling about the rarity of President Nixon 's press conferences , sometimes suggest that he is being secretive . Not at all , contends White House Adviser John D. Ehrlichman : the President does n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly dumb . " On a Los Angeles TV show , Ehrlichman reported : " I 've seen him many times come off one of those things and say ' Is n't it extraordinary how poor the quality of the questions is ? ' " As for the correspondents themselves , Ehrlichman compared them to " insecure young ladies - they keep asking us if we love them . If you do n't want to know , do n't ask . " <P> When they got married in 1964 , they seemed the epitome of the Beautiful People : very young , very rich , and very-well-beautiful . Amanda Burden , daughter of Stanley Mortimer and Mrs. William Paley , was born into the world of social celebrity . Carter Burden , son of a wealthy California investment banker , was a law student who planned a career in politics . For nearly eight years , they were New York 's bright young couple-Carter became a city councilman , and Amanda did charity work . Then they moved into separate apartments . " Amanda has been linked with everybody but President Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been linked with everybody but Golda Meir . " Last week Amanda , 28 , filed for divorce for " cruel and inhuman treatment . " Carter , 30 , replied : " I 'm very surprised and disappointed . " -
