txt In this traffic-confounding city , whose thoroughfares radiate from . downtown 's ancient , paved-over towpaths , commuting for most neoule is a daily struggle . For a few it is not . Over the past four years employees of the Boston branch of the Prudential Life Insurance Company have been offered what may be a unique commuting system . If adopted by many other major employers , such a system could provide a hefty , private-enterprise boost to city efforts to ease rush-hour traffic jams . It encourages many workers to leave their cars at home . The technique is simple but effective . Employees are offered free parking space in the basement of - 1.1- 6 company 's 50-story office tower  --  with just one catch . Space is assigned only to those who car-pool . The more co-workers in a pool , the more likely an employee is to get parking space just an elevator ride from his desk ; five secretaries , for example , win out over four executives . Today nearly half Prudential 's 1,450 employees come to work in cars that park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These - 610 workers include half the- clerical staff , hall the managers , and even three of 10 top executives . Workers of similar grade levels tend to commute together . Too many cars For other companies that want to provide more employee parking space in the basement , Prudential 's plan could point the way . The Prudential system may also suggest a more economical use of costly downtown car-storage space than allowing employees to come alone in their cars and park for a fee . For everyone who drives to work , the benefits of an economic incentive for car pooling are obvious : lower commuting - costs ; fewer cars on the road . Rush-hour traffic jams are not caused by too many people coming to work at the same time , but by too many cars . Most commuters drive alone . In Boston the problem is roughly 8,000 too many cars out of the 33,000 entering the city each hour between 7-9 a.m. on weekdays . Between 9-10 a.m. , when most people are at work , the volume dips to 25,000 . And the car crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first move toward a car pool ? Most commuters who fight traffic alone every day probably do n't give sharing-a-ride a thought . At least four Prudential employees , however , appear sold on a system that coaxes them . " It 's fantastic ! " exclaims Richard McCurry , an assistant systems analyst . " It could n't be any more convenient . " In his pool , five co-workers take turns driving in . Their wives have the family 's only car the other four days . IRS looks the other way " Sometimes in the summer when some are on vacation and I have to drive three times a week , I realize how lucky I am to be in a car pool , " he says . An office manager makes $800 tax-free a year by charging 40 cents a ride to four co-workers . Internal Revenue turns its head as long as this income does n't exceed the cost of " gas , repairs , and similar items . " A secretary who used to split a $35-a-month garage fee with another girl now drives four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . An executive who -- voluntarily- takes part in the system says he prefers it to driving every day . Pooling with three lesser-ranking employees , he now drives an average of 11/2 times a week . He enjoys the company , he says , and the opportunity to read his newspaper on the way in . The Prudential plan stems from a company tradition of providing , among various benefits , free lunches and free parking . Before the Prudential Center complex of shops , office buildings , and high-rise apartments was completed , Prudential workers parked free on a dirt lot on the construction site and had a 10-minute hike to the former headquarters . Something had to be done With the move to the " Pru , " a growing staff soon outnumbered the 200 spaces the company allotted itself in the center 's basement garage . If the free-parking-for-all tradition was to be maintained , something had to be done . Thus , by executive decision in 1967 , the new concept emerged . The waiting list moves slowly , says Michael P. Drees of the personnel section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But eventually everyone , through attrition , will get a crack at the free space , he adds . It may be a long time before such rush-hour solutions as highway tolls for drivers alone or car bans downtown become politically acceptable . Federal transit aid is slow in coming . Meanwhile , for half of Prudential 's workers at least , commuting can be a relaxed , almost pleasant 10-times-a-week experience .
