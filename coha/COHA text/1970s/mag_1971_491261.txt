Pollution is not new . Our concern about it is . Spanish explorers landing in the sixteenth century noted that smoke from Indian campfires hung in the air of the Los Angeles basin , trapped by what is now called the inversion layer . Before the first century B.C. , the drinking waters of Rome were becoming polluted . Most pollution is not due to affluence , despite the current popularity of this notion . In India , pollution runs in the streets and advice against drinking the water in exotic lands is often well taken . Nor can pollution be blamed on the self-seeking activities of greedy capitalists . Once-beautiful rivers and lakes which are now open sewers and cesspools can be found in the Soviet Union as well as in the United States and some of the world 's dirtiest air hangs over cities in Eastern Europe , which are neither capitalist nor affluent . In many ways , indeed , it is much more difficult to do anything about pollution in noncapitalist societies . In the Soviet Union there is no way for the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluters and the courts there work for the same people , who often decide that clean air and water , like good clothing , are low on their list of social priorities . In fact , it seems probable that affluence , technology and slow-moving , inefficient democracy will turn out to be the cures more than the causes of pollution . After all , only an affluent , technological society can afford such luxuries as moon trips , three-day weekends and clean water , although even our society may not be able to afford them all . Only in a democracy can the people hope to have any real influence on the choice among such alternatives . What is new about pollution is what might be called the problem of pollution . Many unpleasant phenomena ? poverty , genetic defects , hurricanes ? have existed forever without being considered pro-Cologne In Cologne , a town of monks and bones , And pavements fang ' d with murderous stones And rags , and hags , and hideous wenches ; I counted two and seventy stenches , All well defined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks , The river Rhine , it is well known , Doth wash your city of Cologne , . But tell me , Nymphs , what power divine Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine ? ? Samuel Taylor Coleridge 1772-1834 blems ; they are , or were , considered to be facts of life , like gravity and death and a mature person simply adjusted to them . Such phenomena become problems only when it begins to appear that something can and should be done about them . It is evident that pollution has advanced to the problem stage . Now the question is what can and should be done ? A specific example of the most promising answer may be found in Germany . The Rhine River is a dirty stream , recently made notorious when an insecticide spilled into the river and killed millions of fish . One tributary of the . Rhine , a river called the Ruhr , is the sewer for one of the world 's most concentrated industrial areas . The Ruhr River valley contains 40 percent of German industry , including 80 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ruhr is a small river , with a low flow of less than half that of the Potomac near Washington . The volume of wastes is extremely large ? actually exceeding the flow of the river itself in the dry season ! Yet people and fish swim in the Ruhr River . This amazing situation is the result of over forty years of control of the Ruhr and its tributaries by a hierarchy of regional authorities . These authorities have as their goal the maintenance of the quality of the water in the area at minimum cost . Water quality is formally defined in a technological way ; however , the objective is " not to kill the fish . " Laboratory tests are conducted to determine what levels of various types of pollution are lethal to fish and from these figures an index is constructed which measures the " amount of pollution " from each source in terms of its fish-killing capacity . Thisindex is different for each source , because of differences in amount and composition of the waste , and geographical locale . Although this physical index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic cost of the waste , it has the advantage of being easily measured and widely understood . Attempts are made on a day-to-day basis to correct the index if necessary ? if , for example , a nonlethal pollutant gives fish an unpleasant taste . Once the index of pollution is constructed , a price , or penalty payment , is put on the pollution and each source is free to adjust its operation any way it chooses . Geographical variation in prices , together with some direct advice from the authorities , encourages new plants to locate where pollution is less damaging . For example , one tributary of the Ruhr has been converted to an open sewer ; it has been lined with concrete and landscaped , but otherwise no attempt is made to reduce pollution in the tributary itself . A treatment plant at the mouth of the stream processes all these wastes at low cost . Therefore , the price of pollution on this tributary is set low . The loss caused by destruction of one tributary is rather small , if the nearby streams are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waste disposal is very large . However , if another tributary were lost , the cost would be higher and the benefits lower ; one open sewer may be the optimal number . The revenues from the pollution charges are used by the authorities to measure pollution , conduct tests and research , operate dams to regulate stream flow and locate waste treatment facilities where economies make this desirable . If the authorities find pollution levels are getting too high , they simply raise the price of pollution , which causes polluters to try to reduce their wastes and provides increased revenues to use on further treatment .

She had seen that look on his face before , and wanted to get him out of there before Tim said too much and en-dangered his porcelain caps .

So both in theory and practice , a price or penalty system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What exactly is the price system of pollution control ? To understand it we must first realize that we are going to make very little real progress in solving the problem of pollution until we recognize it for what , primarily , it is : an economic problem which must he understood in economic terms . Of course , there are noneconomic aspects of pollution , as there are with all economic problems , but all too often , such secondary matters dominate discussion . Engineers , for example , are certain that pollution will vanish once they find the magic gadget or power source . Politicians keep trying to find the right kind of bureaucracy : and bureaucrats maintain an unending search for the correct set of rules and regulations . Those who are above such vulgar pursuits pin their hopes on a moral regeneration or social revolution , apparently in the belief that saints and socialists have no garbage to dispose of . But as important as technology , politics , law and ethics are to the pollution question , all such approaches are bound to have disappointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an economic problem . Most discussions of the pollution problem begin with some startling facts : Did you know that 15,000 tons of filth are dumped into the air of Los Angeles County every day ? But by themselves , such facts are meaningless , if only because there is no way to know whether 15,000 tons is a lot or a little . It is much more important for clear thinking about the pollution problem to understand a few economic concepts than to learn a lot of sensational-sounding numbers . Marginalism One of the most fundamental economic ideas affecting pollution is that of marginalism , which entered economic theory in the nineteenth century . The standard economic problem of that era came to be viewed as that of finding a level of operation of an ' activity which would maximize the net gain from that activity . where the net gain is the difference between the benefits and the costs of the activity . As the level of activity increases , both benefits and costs will increase ; but because of diminishing returns , costs will increase faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , any further expansion increases costs more than benefits . At this " optimal " level , " marginal cost " ? or the cost of expanding the activity ? equals " marginal benefit , " or the benefit from expanding the activity . Further expansion would cost more than it is worth and reduction in the activity would reduce benefits more than it would save costs . The net gain from the activity is said to be maximized at this point . This principle is so simple that it is almost embarrassing to admit that it is the cornerstone of economics . Yet intelligent men often ignore it in discussion of public issues . Educators , for example , often suggest that , if it is better to be literate than illiterate , there is no logical stopping point in supporting education . Or scientists have pointed out that the benefits derived from " science " obviously exceed the costs and then have proceeded to infer that their particular project should be supported . The correct comparison , of course , is between additional benefits created by the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalism to questions of pollution is simple enough in concept . The difficult part lies in estimating the cost and benefits . Several important qualitative points can be made immediately . The first is that the choice facing a rational society is nut between clean air and dirty air , or between clear water and polluted water , but rather between various levels of dirt and pollution . The aim must be to find that level of pollution abatement where the costs of further abatement begin to exceed the benefits . The best combination of pollution control methods is going to be a very complex affair . Such steps as demanding a 10 percent reduction in pollution from all sources , without considering the relative difficulties and costs of the reduction , will certainly be an inefficient approach . Where it is less costly to reduce pollution , we want a greater reduction , to a point where an additional dollar spent on control anywhere yields the same reduction in pollution levels . A second basic economic concept is the idea - or the ideal  --  of the self-regulating economic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread in London : the uncoordinated , selfish actions of many people ? farmer , miller , shipper , baker , grocer ? provide bread for the city dweller , without any central control and at the lowest possible cost . Pure self-interest , guided only by the famous " invisible hand " of competition , organizes the economy efficiently . The logical basis of this rather startling result is that , under certain conditions , competitive prices convey all the information necessary for making the most beneficial decisions . A builder trying to decide whether to use brick or concrete will weigh his requirements and tastes against the prices of the materials . Other users will do the same , with the result that users get brick and cement in quantities and proportions that reflect their individual tastes and society 's production opportunities . No other solution would be better from the standpoint of all the individuals concerned . Private and Social Costs However , the efficiency of competitive markets depends on the identity of private costs and social costs . if the brick-cement producer must compensate somebody for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much to produce and how , will also be socially efficient decisions . Thus , if a producer dumps wastes into the air , river , or ocean ; if he pays nothing for such dumping ; and if the disposed wastes have no noticeable effect on anyone else , living or still unborn ; then the private and social costs of disposal are identical and nil , and the producer 's private decisions are socially efficient . But if these wastes do affect others , then the social costs of waste disposal are not zero . Private and social costs diverge , and private profit-maximizing decisions are not socially efficient . Suppose , for example , that cement production dumps large quantities of dust into the air , which damages neighbors , and that the brick-cement producer pays these neighbors nothing . In the social sense , cement will be overproduced relative to brick and other products because users of the products will make decisions based on market prices which do not reflect true social costs . They will use cement when they should use brick , or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private and social costs is the fundamental cause of pollution of all types and it arises in any society where decisions are at all decentralized ? which is to say , in any economy of any size which hopes to function at all . Even the socialist manager of the brick-cement plant , told to maximize output , given the resources at his disposal , will use the People 's Air to dispose of the People 's Wastes ; to do otherwise would be to violate his instructions . And if instructed to avoid pollution " when possible , " he does not know what to do . How can he decide whether more brick or cleaner air is more important for building socialism ? The capitalist manager is in exactly the same situation . Without prices to convey the needed information , he does not know what action is in the public interest and certainly would have no incentive to act correctly even if he didknow . Although markets fail to perform efficiently when private and social costs diverge , this does not imply that there is some inherent flaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market prices . Decisions based on private cost calculations are usually correct from a social point of view ; and even when they are not quite correct , it often is better to accept this inefficiency than to turn to some alternative decision mechanism , which may be worse . Even the modern economic theory of socialism is based on a high correlation between managerial self-interest and public good . There is no point in trying to find something ? some omniscient and omnipotent deus ex machina ? to replace markets and self-interest . Usually it is preferable to modify existing institutions , where necessary , to make private and social interest coincide . And there is a third relevant economic concept : the fundamental distinction between questions of efficiency and questions of equity or fairness . A situation is said to be efficient if it is not possible to rearrange things so as to benefit one person without harming any others . That is the economic equation for efficiency . Politically , this equation can be solved in various ways ; though most reasonable men will agree that efficiency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the many possible efficient states , each with a different distribution of " welfare " among individuals , is the best one . Fairness and Justice Economics itself has nothing to say about which efficient state is the best . That decision is a matter of personal and philosophical values and ultimately must be decided by some political process . Economicscan suggest ways of achieving efficient states and can try to describe the equity considerations involved in any suggested social policy ; but the final decisions about matters of " fairness " or " justice " can not be decided on economic grounds . Both in theory and practice , the most difficult part of an economic approach to pollution is the measurement of the cost and benefits of its abatement . Only a small fraction of the costs of pollution can be estimated straightforwardly . If , for example , smog reduces the life of automobile tires by 10 percent , one component of the cost of smog is 10 percent of tire expenditures It has been estimated that , in a moderately polluted area of New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laundry , etc. , of $200 per person per year . Such costs must be included in any calculation of the benefits of pollution abatement and yet they are only a part of the relevant costs ? and often a small part . Accordingly , it rarely is possible to justify a measure like river-pollution control solely on the basis of costs to individuals or firms of treating water because it usually is cheaper to process only the water actually used for industrial or municipal purposes and to ignore the river itself . The costs of pollution that can not be measured so easily are often called " intangible " or " noneconomic , " although neither term is particularly appropriate . Many of these costs are as tangible as burning eyes or a dead fish and all such costs are relevant to a valid economic analysis . Let us therefore call these costs " nonpecuniary . " The only real difference between nonpecuniary costs and the other kind lies in the difficulty of estimating them . If pollution in Los Angeles harbor is reducing marine life , this imposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be estimated directly : it would be the fixed cost of converting men and equipment from fishing to an alternative occupation , plus the difference between what they earned in fishing and what they earn in the new occupation , plus the loss to consumers who must eat chicken instead of fish . But there are other , less straightforward costs : the loss of recreation opportunities for children and sportsfishermen and of research facilities for marine biologists , etc . Such costs are obviously difficult to measure and may be very large indeed ; but just as surely as they are not zero , so too are they not infinite . Those who call for immediate action and damn the cost , merely because the spiny starfish and furry crab populations are shrinking , are putting an infinite instead of a marginal value on these creatures . This strikes a disinterested observer as overreacting . The above comments may seem crass and insensitive to those who , like one angry letter-writer to the Los Angeles Times , want to ask : " If conservation is not for its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Well , what is the purpose of pollution control ? is it for its own sake ? Of course not . If we answer that it is to make the air and water clean and quiet , then the question arises : what is the purpose of clean air and water ? If the answer is , to please the nature gods , then it must be conceded that all pollution must cease immediately because the cost of angering the gods is presumably infinite . But if the answer is that the purpose of clean air and water is to further human enjoyment of life on this planet , then we are faced with the economists ' basic question : given the limited alternatives that a niggardly nature allows , how can we best further human enjoyment of life ? And the answer is , by making intelligent marginal decisions on the basis of costs and benefits . A Question of Priorities Pollution control is for lots of things : breathing comfortably , enjoying mountains , swimming in water , for health , beauty and the general delectation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wine , comfortable housing and fast transportation . The question is not which of these desirable things we should have , but rather what combination is most desirable . To determine such a combination , we must know the rate at which individuals are willing to substitute more of one desirable thing for less of another desirable thing . Prices are one way of determining those rates . lf we can not directly observe market prices for many of the costs of pollution , we must find another way to proceed . One possibility is to infer the costs from other prices , just as we infer the value of an ocean view from real estate prices . In principle , one could estimate the value people put on clean air and beaches by observing how much more they are willing to pay for property in non polluted areas . Such information could be obtained ; but there is little of it available at present . Another possible way of estimating the costs of pollution is to ask people how much they would be willing to pay to have pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay $100 a year to have smog reduced 10 or 20 percent . In Barstow , where the marginal cost of smog is much less , a resident might not pay $10 a year to have smog reduced 10 percent . If we knew how much it was worth to everybody , we could add up these amounts and obtain an estimate of the cost of a marginal amount of pollution . For that purpose let 's create a continued from pail ? 151i make-believe Pollution Control Board , which we shall call the PCB . The PCB has a staff of engineers and technicians and they begin working on the obvious question : for each pollution source , how much would it cost to reduce pollution by 10 percent , 20 percent , and so on . If the PCB has some economists , they will know that the cost of reducing total pollution by 10 percent is not the total cost of reducing each pollution source by 10 percent . Rather , they will use the " equimarginal " principle and find the pattern of control such that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same reduction . This will minimize the cost of achieving any given level of abatement . In this way the P ( 'B can generate a " cost of abatement " function , and the corresponding marginal benefit function Cost and Benefit Once cost and benefit functions are known , the PCB can choose a level of abatement that maximizes net gain . This occurs where the marginal cost of further abatement just equals the marginal benefit . If , for example , we could reduce pollution damages by $2 million at a cost of $1 million , we should obviously impose that $1 million cost . But if the damage reduction is only $1/2 million , we should not and in fact should reduce control efforts . This principle is obvious enough but is often overlooked . One author , for example , has written that the national cost of air pollution is $11 billion a year but that we are spending less than $50 million a year on control ; he infers from this that " we could justify a tremendous strengthening of control efforts on purely economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about are sounds . But what is the logical content of the statement ? Does it imply we should spend $11 billion on control just to make things even ? Suppose we were spending $11 billion on control and thereby succeeded in reducing pollution costs to $50 million . Would this imply we were spending too much on control ? Of course not . We must compare the marginal decrease in pollution costs to the marginal increase in abatement costs . Once the optimum pollution level is determined , all that is necessary is for the PCB to enforce the pattern of controls which it has determined to be optimal . But now a new problem arises : how should the controls be enforced ? Some sort of self-regulating system , like a market , is needed , which will automatically adapt to changes in conditions , provide incentives for development and adoption of improved control methods , reduce the amount of information the PCBmust gather and the amount of detailed control it must exercise , and so on . This , by any standard , is a tall order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very simple way to accomplish all this . Put a price on pollution . A price-based control mechanism would differ from an ordinary market transaction system only in that the PCB would set the prices , instead of their being set by demand-supply forces , and that the state would force payment . Under such a system , anyone could emit any amount of pollution so long as he pays the price which the PCB sets to approximate the marginal social cost of pollution . Under this circumstance , private decisions based on self-interest are efficient . If pollution consists of many components , each with its own social cost , there should be different prices for each component . Thus , extremely dangerous materials must have an extremely high price , perhaps stated in terms of " years in jail " rather than " dollars , " although a sufficiently high dollar price is essentially the same thing . In principle , the prices should vary with geographical location , season of the year . direction of the wind and even day of the week , although the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices are set , polluters can adjust to them any way they choose . Because they act on self-interest they will reduce their pollution by every means possible up to the point where further reduction would cost more than the price . Because all face the same price for the same type of pollution , the marginal cost of abatement is the same everywhere . if there are economies of scale in pollution control , as in some types of liquid waste treatment , plants can cooperate in establishing joint treatment facilities . In fact , some enterprising individual could buy these wastes from various plants ( at negative prices ? i.e. , they would get paid for carting them off ) , treat them and then sell them at a higher price , making a profit in the process . ( After all , this is what some rubbish removal firms do now . ) If economies of scale are so substantial that the provider of such a service becomes a monopolist , then the P ( 'B can operate the facilities itself . Obviously , such a scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoard must measure the output of pollution from all sources , collect the fees , and so on . But it does not need to know anything about any plant except its total emission of pollution . It does not control , negotiate , threaten , or grant favors . It does not destroy incentive because development of new control methods will reduce pollution payments . As a test of this price system of control , let us consider how well it would work when applied to automobile pollution , a problem for which direct control is usually considered the only feasible approach . If the price system can work here , it can work anywhere . Suppose , then , that a price is put on the emissions of automobiles . Obviously , continuous metering of such emissions is impossible . But it should be easy to determine the average output of pollution for cars of different makes , models and years , having different types of control devices and using different types of fuel . Through graduated registration fees and fuel taxes , each car owner would be assessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted for whatever control devices he has chosen to install and for his driving habits . If the cost of installing a device , driving a different car , or finding alternative means of transportation is less than the price he must pay to continue his pollution , he will presumably take the necessary steps . But each individual remains free to find the best adjustment to his particular situation . It would be remarkable if everyone decided to install the same devices , which some states currently require ; and yet that is the effective assumption of such requirements . Incentives Even in the difficult case of auto pollution , the price system has a number of advantages . Why should a person living in the Mojave desert , where pollution has little social cost , take the same pains to reduce air pollution as a person living in Pasadena ? Present California law . for example , makes no distinction between such areas ; the price system would . And what incentive is there for auto manufacturers to design a less polluting engine ? The law says only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If GM develops a more efficient engine , the law will eventually be changed to require this engine on all cars , raising costs and reducing sales . But will such development take place ? No collusion is needed for manufacturers to decide unanimously that it would be foolish to devote funds to such development . But with a pollution fee paid by the consumer there is a real advantage for any firm to be first with a better engine and even a collusive agreement would n't last long in the face of such an incentive . The same is true of fuel manufacturers , who now have no real incentive to look for better fuels . Perhaps most important of all , the present situation provides no real way of determining whether it is cheaper to reduce pollution by muzzling cars or industrial plants . The experts say that most smog comes from cars : but even if true , this does not imply that it is more efficient to control autos rather than other pollution sources . How can we decide which is more efficient without mountains of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the same price for the same pollution , and letting self-interest do the job , In situations where pollution outputs can be measured more or less directly ( unlike the automobile pollution case ) , the price system is clearly superior to direct control . A study of possible control methods in the Delaware estuary , for example , estimated that , compared to a direct control scheme requiring each polluter to reduce his pollution by a fixed percentage , an effluent charge which would achieve the same level of pollution abatement would be only half as costly - a saving of about $150 million . Such a price system would also provide incentive for further improvements , a simple method of handling new plants , and revenue for the control authority . Who Pays for Pollution ? In general , the price system allocates costs in a manner which is at least superficially fair : those who produce and consume goods which cause pollution pay the costs . But the superior efficiency in control and apparent fairness are not the only advantages of the price mechanism . Equally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . It is not necessary to have detailed information about all the techniques of pollution reduction , or estimates of all costs and benefits . Nor is it necessary to determine whom to blame or who should pay . All that is needed is a mechanism for estimating , if only roughly at first , the pollution output of all polluters , together with a means of collecting fees , Then we can simply pick a price - any price - for each category of pollution and we are in business . The initial price should be chosen on the basis of some estimate of its effects but need not be the optimal one . If the resulting reduction in pollution is not " enough , " the price can be raised until there is sufficient reduction . A change in technology , number of plants , or whatever , can he accommodated by a change in the price , even without detailed knowledge of all the technological and economic data . Further , once the idea is explained , the price system is much more likely to be politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , such as garbage disposal , is a well established tradition and is much less objectionable than having a bureaucrat nosing around and giving arbitrary orders . When businessmen , consumers and politicians understand the alternatives , the price system will seem very attractive indeed . An important part of this method of control obviously is the mechanism that sets and changes the pollution price . Ideally , the PCB could choose this price on the basis of an estimate of the benefits and costs involved , in effect imitating the impersonal workings of ordinary market forces . But because many of the costs and benefits can not be measured , a less " objective , " more political procedure is needed . This political procedure could take the form of a referendum , in which the PCB would present to the voters alternative schedules of pollution prices , together with the estimated effects of each . There would be a massive propaganda campaign waged by the interested parties , of course , Slogans such as " Vote NO on 12 and Save Your Job , " or " Proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would contain some truth , as the individual voter would realize when he considered the suggested increase in gasoline taxes and auto registration fees . But the other side , in true American fashion , would respond by overstating their case : " Smog Kills , Yes on 12 , " or " Stop Them From Ruining Your Water . " It would be up to the PCB to inform the public about the true effects of the alternatives ; but ultimately , the voters would make the decision . Less Bureaucracy It is fashionable in intellectual circles to object to such democratic procedures on the ground that the uncultured masses will not make correct decisions . If this view is based on the fact that the technical and economic arguments are likely to he too complex to be decided by direct referendum , it is certainly a reasonable position ; one obvious solution is to set up an elective or appointive board to make the detailed decisions , with the expert board members being ultimately responsible to the voters . But often there is another aspect to the antidemocratic position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the desirability of some social policy , not because the issues are too complex but purely because their values are " different " and inferior . To put it bluntly : many ardent foes of pollution are not so certain that popular opinion is really behind them and they therefore prefer a more bureaucratic and less political solution . The question of who should make decisions for whom , or whose desires should count in a society , is essentially a noneconomic question that an economist can not answer with authority , whatever his personal views on the matter . The political structures outlined here , when combined with the economic suggestions , can lead to a reasonably efficient solution of the pollution problem in a society where the tastes and values of all men are given some consideration , In such a society , when any nonrepresentative group is in a position to impose its particular evaluation of the costs and benefits , an inefficient situation will result . The swimmer or tidepool enthusiast who wants Los Angeles Harbor converted into a crystal-clear swimming pool - at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the harbor for commerce and industry - is indistinguishable from the stockholder in Union Oil who wants maximum output from offshore wells , at the expense of everyone in the Santa Barbara area . Both are urging an inefficient use of society 's resources ; both are trying to get others to subsidize their particular thing - a perfectly normal , if not especially noble , endeavor . If the democratic principle upon which the above political suggestions are based is rejected , the economist can not object . He will still suggest the price system as a tool for controlling pollution . With any method of decision - whether popular vote , representative democracy , consultation with the nature gods , or a dictate of the intellectualelite - the price system can simplify control and reduce the amount of information needed for decisions . It provides an efficient , comprehensive , easily understood , adaptable and reasonably fair way of handling the problem . It is ultimately the only way the problem will be solved . Arbitrary , piecemeal , stop-and-go programs of direct control have not and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be raised against the price system as a tool of pollution policy . Most are either illogical or apply with much greater force to any other method of control . What Are the Real Goals ? An interesting type of objection occasionally has been raised against the price system , based essentially on the fear that it will solve the problem . Pollution , after all , is a hot issue with which to assault The Establishment , Capitalism , Human Nature and Them : any attempt to remove the issue by some minor change in institutions , well within The System , must be resisted by The Movement . From some points of view , of course , this is a perfectly valid objection . But one is hopeful that there still exists a majority more concerned with finding solutions than with creating issues . There are other objections which could be raised and answered in a similar way . But the strongest argument for the price system is not found in idle speculation but in the real world - the world where the Rhine and the Ruhr rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why ca n't we eliminate pollution ? " This new , and already trite , rhetorical question invites a rhetorical response : " If physical scientists and engineers approached their tasks with the same kind of wishful thinking and fuzzy moralizing which characterizes much of the pollution discussion , we would never have gotten off the ground .

Social scientists , politicians and journalists who spend their time trying to find someone to blame , searching for a magic device or regulation , or complaining about human nature , will be as helpful in solving the pollution problem as they were in getting us to the moon . The price system outlined here is no magic formula , but it attacks the problem at its roots and has a real chance of providing a long-term solution . !              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
