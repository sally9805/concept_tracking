WARRIORS AND STRANGERS by GERALD HANLEY 319 pages . Harper &; Row . $7.95 . <P> <P> British colonialism has produced a remarkable assortment of fruits and nuts , notably Lawrence of Arabia . But there have also been magnificent blossoms . Sir Richard Burton , the 19th century linguist and imperialist advance man , was an entire garden of delights . Gerald Hanley , the novelist and screenwriter ( The Blue Max ) , is no Burton , although at one point in this memoir he claims to have succeeded where Burton failed-in discovering the secret of Wabaio , a potent arrow poison . <P> But mainly Hanley recalls a world on the wane with the grace and occasional wisdom of a man who has lived fully enough to have few regrets . At 56 , he is a youngish old Africa hand . He left his native Ireland when he was 18 for life on a Kenya farm . As an officer in the British army during World War II , he helped round up Mussolini 's homesick legions in northeast Africa . A more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throats . <P> As Burton had found a century earlier , the Somalis are among the bravest , vainest , crudest and also friendliest races in Africa . They possess enormous self-respect . Somalis love to fight , set great store in a killing well done , and do not mind dying . Hanley recalls coming upon a Somali who had just finished butchering a fellow tribesman . He expressed anxiety only when he realized that Hanley was not going to shoot him on the spot . " You 're not going to start all that court business , are you ? " asked the murderer as he was led away . <P> Serving in the Shag , as Hanley calls the vast oven of interior Somaliland , one found the usual physical torments : heat , flies , the lack of fresh food and cold beer . Drinking from bitter desert water holes led to " Wajir clap , " an excruciating urinary-tract disorder caused by sharp crystals of undissolvable mica and gypsum . Prickly heat could make a man rub himself raw against a wall , al though some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gin . <P> The most merciless enemies , how ever , were loneliness and isolation . For months Hanley 's reading matter was a book entitled Engineering Problems in Paraguay . The pressure of making decisions concerning the volatile Somalis drove many British officers into depression and even suicide . Yet solitude seems to have thrown Hanley backon his best resource : a fine , inquisitive mind whose essential romanticism was balanced by experience . <P> Although his admiration for the Somalis is genuine , he nevertheless sees primitivism as a vastly overrated way of life . On the other hand , the European 's contribution in Africa has too often been merely a more efficient method of killing . Hanley 's solitary reflections have taught him that there is really no satisfying man 's greed , lust and appetite for novelty . In independent Kenya , where he returns to observe , only the Tusker beer seems to be the same . Many of his friends are gone , the game is scarcer and , as Hanley had noticed in much of East Africa , " the cement mixers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
