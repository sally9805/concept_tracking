President Carter has promised to make himself available to citizens on the telephone-by occasionally answering rings at the White House and by arranging what he terms " live call-in sessions " to be broadcast on radio . The first will be carried by CBS on March 5 with Walter Cronkite acting as host and screener . If Walter 's attention happens to wander , there could be some interesting exchanges between the President ( P ) and the callers ( C ) : <P> C : Now see here . I ordered three hot and sour and two shark fin . You got it exactly backward . The moo shu pork came without any pancakes and where are the lichee nuts ? <P> P : There 's been a mistake , ma'am . I 'm Jimmy Carter . <P> C : Right . And I 'm Butterfly McQueen . Now . . . <P> P : No , no . I really am Jimmy Carter . <P> C : Hmmm . You do sound a little like him . <P> P : That 's because I am him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Well land sakes ! What are you doing working in a Chinese restaurant ? <P> P : Hello ? <P> C : Mr. President ? My name is Fred Pullet and I represent an association of small chicken breeders . Me and the boys were flicking the feathers around and we got to wondering if you have any plans for the afternoon of June 18 . <P> P : Uh . . . <P> C : Good , good , that means you can address our annual convention . Nothing too formal , just an hour of remarks on the problems faced by us small chicken breeders . <P> P : You breed small chickens ? <P> C : Ho , ho , that 's rich , Mr. President . Of course , we hear that joke all the time , but me and the boys hardly ever get tired of it . Now , this year 's shindig will be held just outside Hot Coffee , Mississippi . We 'll be easy to find , but I 'll tell you how to get there anyway . You got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a college freshman , and my roommate tells me that you will answer our questions . <P> P : That 's right , Miss . And if I do n't know the answer I will get it from someone in our Administration who does . <P> C. Gee , that 's really super . Here 's the deal . My philosophy prof says that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny . But Margaret , she 's my roomie , and I think it 's a crock . What is your theory on this ontogeny-phylogeny business ? <P> P : I 'm glad you asked me that . I have to run off to a National Security Council meeting just now , but . . . <P> C : Mr. Carter , I turn to you because Ann Landers might take weeks and weeks to answer , what with the lousy state of the Postal Service and all . <P> P : Aha ! The Postal Service ! Now there is a problem I feel the need to discuss , openly and honestly with my fellow . . . <P> C : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . I 've got something really big on my hands . This morning , my husband told me he is having an affair with the cleaning lady . <P> P : Now , I 'm not going to get into the business of condemning my fellow man for behavior that I would never in a million years consider imitating myself . My position on the proper place for lust was made painfully clear during my campaign . . . <P> C : Never mind that . My question is : Do you think it will be harder to get a new husband or a new cleaning lady ? <P> C : Mr. President , this is Fritz . <P> P : Fritz ! What are you doing here ?
