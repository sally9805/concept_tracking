Guideline busting all around <P> Though the Carter Administration preaches austerity in pay raises as part of its anti-inflation gospel , some state and local legislators have been covering their ears and awarding themselves and other public employees hefty boosts . The irony is that these increases , which sometimes range well above the Government 's voluntary guidelines limit of 7% , are made possible because of the rich flow of federal aid to states and localities . In many cases , the money for the raises is available because federal largesse pays for programs that the legislatures would otherwise have to fund . Government programs will this year enrich state and city coffers by $82 billion , an amount more than double the projected federal budget deficit of $33.2 billion . Thus Washington finds itself handing out cash that is being used to undermine its fight against soaring living costs , which are now climbing at an annual rate of 8.8% . <P> Georgia 's house of representatives passed a bill to give teachers a 9% raise this year , prompting protests from both Governor George Busbee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the state senate mounted an effort to deflect the anger but save the increase : it voted a 10% raise bul split the payment in two-a 7% boost beginning next September and 3% in January . Illinois legislators voted themselves both a 25% raise this year ( to $25,000 ) and a further 12% increase for next year . The commissioners on the board of Cook County , which includes Chicago , voted themselves a 30% raise , to $32,500 . When the board 's president vetoed the appropriation for the raise , one member took the matter to court , where it now awaits resolution . <P> Arkansas Governor William Clinton has proposed an increase of 14% for teachers , contending that the raise is completely justified because teacher salaries in his state ( current average : $11,146 ) are among the very lowest in the nation . Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards says that he will seek a 10% increase for all state employees . <P> For a time the White House considered trying to cut back on some federal aid to states that broke the guidelines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as politically risky . Now Kahn says that the Administration will rely on " statesmanship and informed public opinion " to curb the spread of these " outrageous " increases . Unfortunately , that is not likely to be enough to hold down public wage raises , which are highly visible and thus set a tempting example for powerful unions in the trucking , electrical and other industries in this year of heavy labor bargaining .
