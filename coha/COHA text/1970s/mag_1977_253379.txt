New-old charges about spooks in journalism <P> American correspondents working abroad have for years traded half-joking innuendoes about colleagues they suspected of moonlighting for the Central Intelligence Agency , but no one ever knew for sure . Carl Bernstein claims he knows . In the issue of Rolling Stone on sale Oct. 4 , the former Washington Post Watergate sleuth alleges that at least 400 employees of American news organizations have worked directly for or informally aided the agency over the past 25 years , often with their bosses ' approval . <P> Bernstein quotes CIA sources as saying that major news organizations-including the New York Times , CBS and Time Inc. - issued credentials to full-time intelligence agents and allowed their own employees to share information with the CIA and perform various tasks for it . Most of these relationships have ended , Bernstein says , but as of last year some 75 to 90 American journalists were still bound by secret agreements with " the Company . " <P> Some of Bernstein 's charges were denied as quickly as the text of the article was made available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever served as an agent of the CIA or any other intelligence agency while in the employ of CBS , " insisted the network . Time Inc . Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan said he had never condoned or known of any CIA use of TIME correspondents and said he would be " amazed " if any such arrangements had ever been approved by the late Henry Luce , Time Inc. cofounder . " Harry Luce had a very scrupulous regard for the difference between journalism and government , " said Donovan . Sydney Gruson , executive vice president of the New York Times Co. , declared that the paper had no knowledge of any such arrangements . The Times and CBS asked the CIA to open its files on the firms ' employees . <P> Actually there is less to the Rolling Stone article than its length ( 12,000 words ) would lead one to expect . Though Bernstein is the first CIA watcher to number the agency 's journalist-helpers as high as 400 , most of his article summarizes charges already made by other investigators . Moreover , his disclosures deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early ' 60s . " All these issues looked very different when there was a broad consensus in American society about who were the good guys and who were the bad guys , " says Robert Kaiser , a veteran foreign correspondent for the Washington Post .
