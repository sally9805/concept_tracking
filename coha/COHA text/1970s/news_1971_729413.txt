txt Overriding Mayor Lindsay , the Board of Estimate voted 16 to 6 yesterday against moving slum families into trailer parks pending completion of urban renewal projects . The sentiment was that the trailer parks would degenerate into permanent slums or " minighettos . " In another action , the board ) gave a sympathetic hearing to the long-talked-about plan for a consolidated passenger liner terminal on the Hudson between 48th and 52d Streets . The Port of New York Authority is ready to start construction work on the $26 , .9-million terminal in the late summer or fall and would operate it for 20 years , Austin J. Tobin , the authority 's executive director , told the board . The board agreed to meet again Thursday to vote on the construction - and - lease agreement with the Port Authority . City sources said that some details remained to be decided . The Port Authority , the steamship industry and the International Longshoremen 's Association all gave strong endorse . ment to the terminal plan yesterday . It calls for complete reconstruction of Piers 88 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling , roof parking and vehicular access from the West Side Highway . To help defray costs of the new terminal , there will be a special charge ranging from $2.35 to $6 a passenger , depending on the length of the voyage . The board 's public meeting was delayed three hours while the members met in executive session trying to thresh out decisions on the trailer parks and on $848,380 in controversial contracts involving a private consultant . Finally , the board agreed to pay that amount to the New York City-Rand Institute and the Rand Corporation , the first such payment to consultants since Controller Abraham D. Beame last September challenged the Mayor 's right to hire consultants without board hearings . The board 's action on trailers specifically killed a plan for a 100-unit mobile-home park on a 10-acre site in an Arverne . Queens , urban renewal area . A group of 40 residents from Arverne who had fought for weeks for rehabilitation of existing houses to serve as temporary homes cheered and applauded . The board , also by a 16-to-6 vote , rejected a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " parks " for a maximum of four years elsewhere in the city , So the ban is general . The Mayor , with four votes , was able to muster only the additional two votes of the Bronx Borough President , Robert Abrams . In the Arverne case the argument was essentially between using the trailers or rehabilitating existing housing , which the administraton has descrbed as a number of primitive , horrible hovels . But the Queens Borough President , Sidney Leviss , carlied the board with his argument that enough houses could be rehabilitated to serve for several years and that the overall cost would be cheaper than the trailers . The trailers had been destined , for 100 of the most destitute of ; 600 families , mainly black , live ing in that area . " For approximately the same ' cost of buying and installing a ' trailer unit , " Percy E. Sutton , : Manhattan Borough President said , " the city can rehabilitate a unit in a structurally sound building . And a rehabilitated unit will last 30 years or more while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than two or three years . " He contended that a Chicago , experiment had shown trailers ; to be unfit for such housing ; purposes . Mr. Sutton went on to argue , that approval for Arverne ; would lead desperately poor families to demand a mushrooming of trailer parks in other slum areas . City Council President Sanford D. Garelik recalled the sad experience of " temporary " Quonset huts , used for housing and other purposes in World War II . Many were not removed for years . It was mid-afternoon before the board got to the subject of the passenger liner terminal , The city 's Economic Development Administrator , Ken Patton , said that the new midtown terminal of six berths would be supplemented by Pier 40 , a modern three-berth facility ; near Houston Street , and have ; a capability of handling one million passengers yearly . Mr. Tobin said that the Port Authority could build the midtown terminal in two years . In the last 15 years , the number of trans-atlantic passengers has dwindled from 724,000 to 190 , - 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - 000 , making an over-all total of 684,000 passengers here last year . The cruise boom is continuing . The plan calls for the city to finance the $26.9-million construction cost by floating bonds . The Port Authority would pay an annual rent large enough to pay off the bonds and interest . In addition , the city hopes to obtain a minimum of $425,000 a year in revenue from the facility . In agreeing unanimously to pay the Rand consultant contracts , the board resolved an issue involving invalid and illegal agreements . During last year 's dispute with the Mayor , Mr. Beame said that his office would not officially register such contracts unless the Board of Estimate had passed on them , Seeking a way around Mr. Beame , the Mayor ordered his administrators to issue " letters of intent " in lieu of formal contracts but with the promise of contracts to come . In a court test , the letters of intent were declared invalid but it was pointed out that the consultant had a claim since the city did not benefit from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eliminating any profit , interest and certain costs . Rand had made studies for the Fire Department , Health Services Administration and Housing and Development Administration on matters ranging from the " likely future demand for fire protection services " to the health problem of schistosmiasis or " swimmer 's itch , " a skin condition traced to a parasite of snails .
