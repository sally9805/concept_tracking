SOMEBODY 'S DARLING <P> by Larry McMurtry <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 347 pages ; $10 <P> As if a first-person novel were not difficult enough , Larry McMurtry narrates his new Hollywood story in three first-person voices . In Book 1 , Joe Percy , a sixtyish screenwriter and seducer of bored young Bel Air wives , speaks of his affection for Director Jill Peel . Book 2 collects the machismo sputterings of Producer Owen Oarson , who moves in as Jill 's great physical love . Book 3 is written in Jill 's voice-a cool meditation on her life , her men , and their inscrutable ways . <P> Like a Hollywood morning , Somebody ' s Darling gets off to a slow start , but picks up velocity and life ( and more than a few deaths ) as it moves along . McMurtry tosses off a few good Sam Spade-ish one-liners ( an aging producer toasting in the poolside sun is a " ninety-year-old french fry " ) , and a pair of good-ole-boy screenwriters from Texas provide boisterous comic relief . McMurtry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of place and trade . The celluloid scene has been done before ; what McMurtry gives it-as he gave that sour Texas town in his The Last Picture Show-is a sense that even the meanest lives deserve a measure of compassion . <P> <P> PANAMA by Thomas McGuane Farrar , Straus &; Giroux 175 pages ; $7.95 <P> Thomas McGuane 's first three novels ( The Sporting Club , The Bushwhacked Piano and Ninety-Two in the Shade ) certified him as a young man on the way to becoming a Major American Writer , one of the four or five best of his generation ( he is now 38 ) . McGuane , ran the critics ' early form , was Hemingway by way of the drug generation . <P> Perhaps celebrity is bad for the talent . In any case , Panama is fairly minor McGuane . In his tale , Chester Hunnicutt Pomeroy is an overnight American superstar rapidly descending to the white-dwarf stage . His act , something along the lines of Alice Cooper 's , only more so , included a routine in which he crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball pitching machine . Now , his brainpan made porous by drugs , Pomeroy has withdrawn to Key West , where he maniacally stalks his old love Catherine . A man with a lot less charm or interest than the author imagines , Pomeroy is given to such gestures as nailing his hand to Catherine 's front door with a gun butt . He is also inclined to flights of lyrical bombast : " They were pines that dared to suggest that islands are misery where brave horsemen run off the earth and topple into the unknown . " <P> Panama may be intended as a dithyramb of exhaustion-Pomeroy 's and , grandiosely , the American culture 's . But despair loses something when it is unearned and vaguely cute . The novel savors of cocaine , narcissism and a certain impenetrable smugness . <P> MIRANDA by Pamela Sanders Little , Brown 429 pages ; $9.95 <P> " I have been sexually slumming for years , " confesses Miranda Pickerel . <P> " Having finally broken the bonds of propriety , I , like a proper Victorian gentleman , reserved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestal .
