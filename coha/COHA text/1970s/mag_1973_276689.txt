COVER STORY <P> Glendower : " I can call spirits from the vasty deep . " <P> Hotspur : " Why , so can I , or so can any man ; " But will they come when you do call for them ? " <P> - Henry IV , Part I <P> THE Mexican border is a great divide . Below it , the accumulated structures of Western " rationality " waver and plunge . The familiar shapes of society - landlord and peasant , priest and politician - are laid over a stranger ground , the occult Mexico , with its brujos and carismaticos , its sorcerers and diviners . Some of their practices go back 2,000 and 3,000 years to the peyote and mush room and morning-glory cults of the ancient Aztecs and Toltecs . Four centuries of Catholic repression in the name of faith and reason have reduced the old ways to a subculture , ridiculed and persecuted . Yet in a country of 53 mil lion , where many village marketplaces have their sellers of curative herbs , peyote buttons or dried hummingbirds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long been a matter of interest to anthropologists . But five years ago , it could hardly have been guessed that a master 's thesis on this recondite subject , published under the conservative imprint of the University of California Press , would become one of the bestselling books of the early ' 70s . <P> Old Yaqui .

The Teachings has sold more than 300,000 copies in paperback and is currently selling at a rate of 16,000 copies a week . But Castaneda 's books are not drug propaganda , and now the middle-class middlebrows have taken him up . Ixtlan is a hardback bestseller , and its paperback sales , according to Castaneda 's agent Ned Brown , will make its author a millionaire . <P> To tens of thousands of readers , young and old , the first meeting of Castaneda with Juan Matus-which took place in 1960 in a dusty Arizona bus depot near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dante and Beatrice beside the Arno . For Don Juan 's teachings have reached print at precisely the moment when more Americans than ever before are disposed to consider " non-rational " approaches to reality . This
