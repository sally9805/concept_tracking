txt The sun shines 293 days a year on this city of 90,000 , not unusual for an area 50 miles south of San Francisco where the weather is typically Mediterranean . What is unique is the commitment of city fathers to put all that solar power to work . With the help of federal government grants , several innovative solar programs are being tried here , and the results could provide a model for other parts of the country where the sun continues to shine on disappearing fossil fuels . Santa Clara ? like all of California ? relies heavily on natural gas for most of its energy . And so it is not surprising that this nonrenewable resource keeps going up in price as its supply dwindles . The Stanford Research Institute figures California has lost 76,000 manufacturing jobs in the past five years because of decreasing gas supplies . It is estimated that figure could grow to 800,000 over the next five years . Meanwhile , state regulators continue to allow gas price rises that affect all Californians . The Santa Clara City Council began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate energy sources , principally solar . The results so far : ? The city 's new community recreation center is the largest building in the world that is both heated and cooled by solar energy . It is // From page 1 *Novel solar heat program in California now the subject of a study by the federal Energy Research and Development Administration ( ERDA ) . ? The city this summer established the nation 's first " solar utility " to provide systems for heating swimming pools . Owners pay the city an initial $200 fee plus about $30 a month ( depending on pool size ) for design , construction , and maintenance of a solar heating system . It already has been shown that such a system is less expensive than gas heat and there is a waiting list of pool owners . ? With help from a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) Twit , Santa Clara has expanded its solar utility demonstration program to residential heating . Five homes that will rely on solar power for heating and hot water are soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city held a drawing to determine who could buy the new solar-powered homes . Santa Clara also has plans to expand its city-operated solar utility to offer hot water heating systems adaptable to existing homes . While solar heating is less expensive in the long run , its initial high costs so far make it unacceptable to most private homeowners . City Manager Donald R. von Raesfeld figures that a public solar utility of the type now being tried in Santa Clara can act as a stimulus to eventual widespread use of solar energy . " It 's like the first Henry Ford autos , " he said . " At first , only the rich could afford them . But as time goes on , and as the devices are perfected , they will be affordable by everyone . " Santa Clara also soon will be the site of the nation 's first industrial complex designed around a solar heating system . Developer Ray Handley is sure that rapidly dwindling dcimestic gas supplies ? estimated by some to be depleted in less than 30 years ? will make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've spent so much time neglecting free energy , " Mr. Handley said . " I feel the only way I can encourage other firms to use solar energy is to show them a successful project . We have to prove it can be done efficiently and economically , and that 's what this prototype project is meant to do . "
