Through the years that historian Henry Steele Commager has fought the good fight for civil rights and responsible government , he has been more concerned with the issues than abstractions , " with the sins of Boston , not of Babylon , " as he wrote of his preacher-abolitionist hero , Theodore Parker , in a biography 38 years ago . All along , though , he has affirmed himself a Jeffersonian in principle . Now , in these essays , he pauses to explain what it was he had in mind ; his Jefferson is a sleeper . The great principle that Jefferson promoted , declares Commager , is that human beings can determine their own destiny , that they can triumph over history , that human nature can change in a favorable environment ? in America , that is . Here he parted company with his friends of the European Enlightenment . Theirs was an elitist concept of progress , confined to the advancement of the arts and sciences and filtering down slowly from the top to the bottom of the social ladder . In Arnerica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance of the new world had made it a reality ? " milk " milk for the children , " says Commager , " meat on the table , a well-built house , a well-filled woodshed , a well-tilled farm with cattle in the pasture and hay in the barn . It meant self-government , religious freedom , schools and colleges . " And it was no accident that Jefferson included " the pursuit of happiness " among the unalienable rights of Americans . He was in dead earnest . In Virginia he wiped out primogeniture and entailed estates ? those holdovers of hereditary privilege , and unsuccessfully proposed a law to grant 50 acres of land to every propertyless ( white ) male . As President he multiplied the abundance by doubling the national domain . In retirement he capped his labors with the founding of the University of Virginia for the training of philosopher kings . Precursor of the welfare state ! We knew that Jefferson 's heart was big enough to embrace the New Deal , 1 ? ? 14,4 , -4 , , Lyzer guessed that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who maintained that that government is best which governs least , to the opponent of centralization and the champion of states ' rights , the advocate even of the creation of " ward republics " as the bedrock local units where every citizen would participate in person ? Commager would rather not dwell on that aspect . He would rather not hamper the capacity of government to cope with the problems of a mass industrial society . Yet there were , after all , two Jeffersons , and while the first may have been good for the 1930s , the second , the Jefferson of the Declaration of Independence , of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom , and of the Kentucky Resolutions against the Alien and Sedition Acts , may be better for the 1970s . The first can still help us to fight poverty , but the second , and the one to which Commager has given ample allegiance in practice , may nerve us to resist undeclared wars , discrimination based on race and sex , attacks on free speech and the press , and invasion of privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inconsistent , and in fact there was a third Jefferson that Commager knows but does not confront ? the Jefferson of the credibility gap . The revisionist historians have been swarming over him ; one of them ( Leonard W. Levy in Jefferson and Ci-Lci2 Liberties : The Darker Side ) has inspired Gore Vidal 's peppery picture of him in the novel , Burr . We discover that Jefferson inveighed against slavery but supinely submitted to its public invulnerability and private gratification ? never freeing his own or anybody else 's slaves while encumbering his estate with the financial burdens of a lavish mansion , an expensive library , rare art treasures , and an endless stream of household guests . That he extolled civil liberties but as governor of Virginia signed into law a bill requiring loyalty oaths and the detention of the disaffected in internment camps , a bill limiting freedom of the press , and a bill of attainder . That he advocated a weak executive but as President conducted a dictatorial vendetta against Aaron Burr and his associates , prosecuting them for treason without sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury . That he demanded strict construction of the Constitution but purchased Louisiana under cover of the treaty-making power , fought a war against Tripoli without a declaration by Congress , and used the army arbitrarily against private citizens to enforce compliance with the embargo . That he argued for academic freedom but at the University of Virginia censored textbooks and pro- fessors for their political opinions . Of course we could heed the advice of Jefferson 's last message , left on his tombstone , to disregard the record of his administrations . But we have been instructed too expertly by a recent Chief Executive of blessed memory to watch what Presidents do , not what they say . If it 's preaching we want we might do better to turn to Commager 's other hero , the uncomplicated crusader for women 's rights , world peace , and above all , abolitionism . He , too , proclaimed him- self a Jeffersonian . Still we might prefer to pray with Parker .                  @ @ @
