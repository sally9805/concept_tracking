Letters Taipei , Peking and the Taiwanese To the Editor : Thomas Metzger 's letter ( July 2 ) on the " two-China " question I found both simplistic and superficial , concealing as much as it reveals . It is probably true that most of the people of Taiwan support the Taiwanese Government 's opposition to a takeover by the Peking Government . But let us examine what the people of Taiwan know about mainland China : What is their source of news ? In Taiwan the only " news " allowed to be printed about China are either reports of failure and/or problems or else a faithful recording as fact of a stream of damaging rumors . How many , many times was Mao 's death reported as fact over the years ? How many mainland famines and civil wars were likewise reported as fact ? Surely Mr. Metzger remembers as well as I how frightened the people of Taiwan are to discuss or even to think positive thoughts about Communism or the Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail . The Taiwanese view of Communism in China is as limited and distorted as a police state and rigid press control can make it . But just because the people might support one policy of the Government , // Kimble Mead Futile Lane To the Editor : We are told that the city is broke ? or nearly so ? yet this morning I see that somehow a bike lane has been painted on Avenue of the Americas . a bike lane that so far has been completely ignored by the cyclists . Adding to the futility of the gesture , double-parked cars and vans eliminate the space . C'm on . City Hall ? quit fooling around ! JAMES J. BROOKS New York , July 1 , 1978 Without Nuclear Power To the Editor : In her June 27 letter Assistant Prof. Carol Halpert Schwartz berates utilities for " evading " decommissioning costs in estimating the costs of nuclear energy . Because of these costs and because of putative safety and technical problems , she concludes , " it is monumental folly to continue the construction of nuclear plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the economic costs , ' health effects , environmental impact and degree of folly that will accrue from not building nuclear plant facilites , namely , the costs of increased reliance on foreign oil as long as it lasts , the impact on air , land , climate , transportation systems and health of heavy reliance on coal and the economic and human consequences of the serious energy shortfalls that will almost certainly develop in the absence of nuclear power . PETER MAZUR Oak Ridge , Tenn. , July 4 , 1978 one must not conclude that the people lend that Government general support . Mr. Metzger fails to mention that most knowledgeable observers agree that the majority of the people of Taiwan are not at all loyal to their own Government . Nor is there any reason they should be . Has Mr. Metzger forgotten the slaughter of indigenous Taiwanese leadership on Feb. 28 , 1947 ? Has he forgotten the Gestapostyle search of the entire island one night in August 1965 , to arrest any and all political opposition leaders ? What about the " secret " police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business sections of Taipei ; the curfews ; the unexplained disappearance of friends and acquaintances ? Moreover , the Government , while " freely elected , " is overwhelmingly dominated by the non-Taiwanese mainlanders , who forced their rule upon the people of Taiwan in 1947-49 . Also , while the island is indeed economically " thriving , " much of that wealth has gone to these same mainlanders while many of the Taiwanese continue to live in poverty . Mr. Metzger mentions stability , but he fails to mention how that " stability " is based upon American arms . American-and Japanese-financed inTo the Editor : Hisham Sharabi 's article on the OpEd page of June 27 makes certain representations which are totally inadmissible as they concern the Lebanese-American community . It is true that most Arabic-speaking Americans are of Lebanese descent , but it does not follow that the Lebanese are Arabs or that their interests are the same as those of the Arab countries whose cause Sharabi espouses . The Lebanese-Americans do not share the Arabs ' enmity toward Israel ; nor do they identify with the Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own land by their insistence on a separate particularity from the Arabs around them . For Sharabi to claim that the Lebanese-Americans are Arabs is a deceptive statement calculated at capitalizing on the reservoir of good will which the LebaneseAmericans have built in this country over the decades . The Lebanese can not accept total political or cultural assimilation with the Arab world ; to do so would be no To the Editor : Your June 29 editorial " Who Won ? , " along with a spate of other editorials and television specials in the days immediately following the Supreme Court 's ambiguous decision in the Bakke case , praised " the Harvard way of insuring places for disadvantaged racial-minority students in its undergraduate body without the use of rigid quotas . I have been an undergraduate at Harvard for over a'year , and the black and Hispanic students that I know best come from upper-middle-class homes in places like Shaker Heights , Princeton , New Rochelle and my own Valley Stream on Long Island . No one can deny they are members of racial minorities , but who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contradictions like this point to the fundamental problem with " affirmative action " programs as they are now used : Special , even preferential consideration may indeed be appropriate for some applicants . But we must measure true economic disadvantage in order to decide which individuals are needy , and not use overly general industry and a legal " state of emergency " that has existed since 1949 , allowing the Government at will to overlook civil and political rights guaranteed in the constitution . The Government has neither earned nor gained genuine support from the majority of the people living on Taiwan . Mr. Metzger also fails to inform his readers that his " two Chinas " culturally are one . Taiwan has been a province of China since the 16th century . Its language , food , music , literature , marriage and family customs and methods of agriculture are much the same as in any other province of China , given regional variations . Today it is not only Mr. Reston and the Peking Government that accept Taiwan as a province of China . This is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . In fact , it is even the official position of the Government of Taiwan itself . Thus the question of one China or two depends upon much more than one 's preference for Peking duck . No matter where he eats his duck , Mr. Metzger has certainly failed to help the rest of us find our way through the maze we call the Taiwan question . MARSHALL R. KAPLAN La rchmont , N.Y. , July 3,1978 less than committing cultural suicide . The Lebanese a-e insisting that their separate particularity be recognized by their neighbors , be they Arabs or Israelis . The 2.5 million Lebanese-Americans are deeply saddened by the strife in Lebanon and by the dissolution of Lebanese sovereignty over Lebanese soil . We call on all concerned , especially our American Government , to help disarm the Palestinians in Lebanon , thereby bringing Lebanon back to a semblance of its former self as a free and democratic country . Is it just for the Arabs to insist on Palestinian self-determination and deny that same principle when it is advanced by the Lebanese ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Syrians and the rest of the Arabs ? left alone to determine their own destiny by the same free electoral process which had governed their internal relations . MICHAEL S.

JOAN FEIGENBAUM Valley Stream , L.I. , June 30 , 1978 Underground Sounds To the Editor : Has it occurred to the writer of the July 3 letter that " prominent signs " proscribing radio playing in the subways would be about as effective as those that prohibit smoking , spitting , running , littering , standing in certain places and walking or riding between the cars ? I suggest that the Tran " it Authority not only not commissirai a million-dollar study of this rather tiny " problem " but do nothing about it . The subways are not noted for the pristine quality of their ambient sound . An occasional portable radio is , if anything , a distraction from the racket of steel wheels grating against steel rails .

Beneficiaries of Affirmative Action Federal Workers ' Pay Rates : The ' Two Wrongs ' To the Editor : Once again , the heavy hand of The Times has played an unofficial role in the establishment of governmental policy . In this case the policy is erroneous largely because the information published by The Times was distorted " Buttoning Up Federal Blue Collars , " editorial June 27 . Some of the misrepresentations were incidental and seemingly insignificant . For instance , you indicate that some 400,000 blue-collar Federal workers would be affected by this action . The true figure is 500,000 , and they would have received an average of 8 percent in pay increases , rather than the 9 percent you indicated . But the major distortion in this editorial lies more with its emphasis than in statistical inaccuracies . The editorial plays fast and loose with adjectives , noting that the " most visible symbol of President Carter 's commitment to fight inflation within government is his decision to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've said before that the President 's program is heavy on symbolism and light on effectiveness , primarily because you ca n't fight inflation with symbols , and Federal workers are tired of being one of the most visible symbols . Under Carter 's program , only Federal workers will be targeted for mandatory wage controls . Wage controls are in themselves distasteful , but they are doubly so when discriminatorily applied to one element of the work force . You assert ( incorrectly ) that . Federal employees under the blue-col-lar pay system have done " exceedingly well , averaging 8 percent more than their counterparts in the private sector , " but you fail to note that their rates are based on surveys of each standard no ! ' ropolitan surmv area to match the rates paid in the private sector . This means that Federal rates ? as we have noted so often ? follow the wage patterns of private-sector wages . Thus it it impossible to have any impact on inflation if you hold down the wages of those whose pay is based on comparability with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your suggestion is analagous to government control of The Times 's advertising and subscription rates without similar controls on the cost of paper , ink or the labor that goes into the product . What The Times , the Administration and the Senate seem to have forgotten is that Federal workers live in the same economy as everyone else , and their economic environment is not correspondingly controlled along with their wages . If The Times or any of the other critics of Federal pay systems had a legitimate concern for workers ' welfare , they would be urging control on interest , profits and prices . You do n't seem inclined to do so . Your argument that a cap on bluecollar pay will somehow make the President 's unjust decision to cap white-collar pay more just is simply circular logic . In effect , you 're saying that two wrongs make a right , and it just ai n't so . KENNETH T.
