Doctors have long studied the physical aspects of pregnancy , but they have paid little attention to its psychological effects . Recently scientists have begun to make up for this lack . Their conclusion : pregnancy is not a time of passive waiting by the woman alone , but an experience of active metamorphosis for both man and woman ; while a baby is being formed physically , a family is being created psychologically . <P> That view is held both by Manhattan Psychoanalyst Max Deutscher , who has just begun a new study of the dreams and fantasies of first pregnancy , and by San Francisco Psychiatrist Arthur Colman and his wife Libby , authors of Pregnancy : The Psychological Experience , to be published in January by Herder &; Herder . As Deutscher and the Colmans see it , the transformation of marital partners into parents goes through three stages lasting three months each . THE FIRST TRIMESTER is basically a time of shock , during which the coming birth is recognized as a cause of major chang es . The wife becomes more dependent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice being a father . At other times , the husband 's dependence on his wife , spurred by fear that he may lose her to their child , gives the woman an opportunity to be maternal . Pregnancy , in short , becomes a rehearsal for family life . Husband and wife compare themselves with their own parents , a process that may stimulate self-doubt and guilt ( Can they do as well as the older generation ? Ought they to do better ? ) . <P> THE SECOND TRIMESTER is more peaceful . The most important event is the quickening , when the developing infant 's movements can first be felt and it begins to seem human . According to Deutscher , couples report playing with the wife 's belly and " pushing it to call forth a response from the fetus . " There is , he says , " a sense of hilarity and awe , of joking and solemnity and of some quality of respect " that is almost religious . <P> In this period , mothers may talk to the fetus ( ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples give the baby a name - though Deutscher has found that maladjusted couples may christen it " The Thing " or " The Monster . " Both husband and wife have fantasies about their child 's personality . <P> THE THIRD TRIMESTER is dominated by two themes : the couple 's increasingly obvious sexual differences and their fears of death . The woman 's enlarging body increases her sense of strangeness and sexual isolation from her husband , but it also heightens her feeling of femininity and her husband 's pleasure in his masculinity . One woman told Colman that she felt radiant when her husband looked at her approvingly " as I clambered up the stairs in my new awkward way . " But Colman reports the depression that he himself felt after a concert he attended with his pregnant wife . " The pianist and Libby were both creative ; I was nothing , " he says . <P> The second theme is often expressed as worry over delivery-a worry that can affect men as well as women . Frightened by a film depicting childbirth , one husband dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes . In Deutscher 's experience , couples who do not express their fears frequently fail to create a real family .
