Mutual funds are being shaken by an investor revolt . In seven of the past 13 months , the sale of new fund shares to the public has slipped behind redemptions , and the trend is accelerating . In April the excess of redemptions over purchases rose to $250 million , up from the record $194 million in March . Investors are cashing in their shares partly because the funds performed poorly in 1969 and 1970 , though they did better than the market averages last year . However , some funds have been able to prosper in the face of the industry depression . <P> Rowe Price <P> Isolated in downtown Baltimore , 187 miles from Wall Street , T. Rowe Price &; Associates is taking in more money than it can handle . The firm manages the best-performing U.S. mutual fund . According to the Wiesenberger Services , the industry 's leading chronicler , the Rowe Price New Horizons Fund increased the net asset value of each of its shares by 287% in the past decade . To the individual investors , that means an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , the fund has been receiving as much as $1.3 million a day in new investment money , even though last year it upped the minimum-share purchase from $2,500 to $25,000 . Unable to put the money to work in the stock market fast enough , T. Rowe Price closed the fund to new investments in March . <P> The firm was started in 1937 by Thomas Rowe Price , now 74 and retired , as an investment-counseling outfit . It was not until 1950 that Price started his first mutual fund , the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund . It was the industry 's best performer in the 1950s and still ranks high among large growth funds . Price has one other fund in his fold , the Rowe Price New Era , started in 1969 . All of Price 's funds are " no loads , " meaning that the funds have no salesmen and the buyer does not pay a sales commission . Price 's funds have won such a reputation as sound investments that last year their combined net sales amounted to $214 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their assets of $1.5 billion were a mere 2.8% of the industry total . <P> Charles Shaeffer , 61 , is now the president of T. Rowe Price and owns about 20% of its stock ; the rest is owned by other employees . Shaeffer , a gray-haired , athletic man , joined the company shortly after it was formed and still follows its founder 's philosophy : invest in a stock for at least three to five years , but only if the company 's profits are growing faster than the rate of inflation . Some years back Thomas Rowe Price rather conservatively defined a growth company as one whose earnings and dividends double every ten years . Shaeffer carefully avoids cyclical stocks like aerospace companies and concentrates on stocks in consumer goods and services ( Levitz , Kresge and Levi Strauss ) , natural resources ( Lubrizol , Weyerhaeuser , Standard Oil of Indiana and Georgia-Pacific ) , and science and technology ( Electronic Data Systems , IBM and Xerox ) . <P> Dreyfus Offshore Trust             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
