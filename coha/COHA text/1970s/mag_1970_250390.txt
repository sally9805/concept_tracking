Last week the Furriers Joint Council of New York , representing 99% of the nation 's 11,000 fur workers , announced that it had reached an agreement with the World Wildlife Fund .

Some manufacturers have challenged the new law in court . Retailers , particularly in New York City , have slashed prices on spotted furs in order to liquidate stocks . Ben Kahn , for example , is selling $12,000 leopard coats for $6,000 and $6,000 cheetah coats for $3,000 . <P> For all the furor , the ban is not likely to cripple the industry . Less than 1% of its $300 million in annual sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of minks and other animals bred for their pelts , which are not on the endangered list . <P> Even with the ban , some conservationists fear that poachers will continue to slaughter the big cats , since the skins can be sold in other countries . Now this avenue appears to be closing too . The International Fur Trade Federation , a London-based union , has announced an embargo on otter , tiger and snow and clouded leopard skins .
