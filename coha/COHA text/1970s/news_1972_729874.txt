The loss could total over $1-million . The Police Chief of Detectives , Albert A. Seedman , said during the day that the figure might reach $500,000 , although he called this " an educated guess " pending a canvass of guests , since the hotel keeps no record of box contents . But late last night , as the interviews went on , the police said one mart had satisfied them he had lost jewelry and money worth $800,000 . They would not identify him . Chief Seedman said he could only " hope it wo n't turn out " to be the largest hotel robbery in the city 's history .

Goldberg when he was the United States representative to the United Nations . The hotel switchboard was inundated yesterday with queries from , residents away on vacation , " It seems like every guest who is in Palm Beach or on the Riviera has called us this morning , " Mr. Keeney said . They Arrive in Limousine The bandit team of four or ' five men , including one posing as the chauffeur of the limousine , drove up to the 61st Street entrance of the Pierre just after 4 A.M.

The holdup men , either satisfied with their haul or apprehensive about time , left by the door by which they had entered and outside which their car had been glimpsed . The shackled men and women were freed by the police after one employe had loosened his bonds and triggered the emergency alarm  --  a step the holdup men had warned against when they first entered . The Pierre bandits , like those at the Drake , were all described as white , in their 30 's and varying in height from 5 feet 5 inches to 6 feet .

She declined to identify herself or to say whether she was a resident or a guest . Chief Seedman said that , based on normal use of the boxes , the . bandits ' loot was probably " mainly " jewelry . He said the men who rifled the boxes had obtained a guest list from the clerk and appeared to have " selectively chosen " those boxes presumed more likely to have jewelry . 3 . V. Bennett , manager of the hotel , later denied this and said the boxes had been opened " randomly " or with an eye to accessibility or easier leverage . F.B.I .

The F.B.I . was investigating the possibility that the robbery might have been , in Chief Seedman 's words , " an out-ofstate job , " or that the thieves would take their loot out of the state for disposal . No one was harmed by the holdup men , but Francisco Velez , a kitchen staff member 1 who entered the lobby while the robbery was in progress , displayed a wrist that was bruised and abraded by handcuffs . one of the robbers , wearing a Hotel ' Pierre uniform jacket taken from a bellman , manned the only working elevator after the operator had been tied up .
