BLUE MOVIE by Jerry Southern . 287 pages . World . $6.95 . <P> <P> This is Terry Southern 's first novel in eleven years , and the news is that he has given up hard-core scatology . Blue Movie has but a single passing reference to excrement , and only one physical freak . Instead , the author is content to employ his demonic imagination on an almost routine device for writing a pornbook : the step-by-step story of filming the most elaborate stag flick in history . <P> The Faces of Love , the movie 's demure title , is the brainchild of bored Boris Adrian , a film maker in the tradition of Chaplin and Fellini whose previous efforts have exhausted the topics of Death , Infinity and the origin of Time .

How would it look then ? " <P> " Christ , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sid Krassman . But soon Sid has wrung three million out of the tourist-starved principality of Liechtenstein to help finance the monstrosity and assured the rest by signing up Angela Sterling , " the highest-paid darling of the silver screen - nailing a cool one and a quarter big ones per pic , plus ten percent of the boxoroonie , going in . " <P> Loosed among the grips and rushes , the author of The Magic Christian and Candy is like a mad puppeteer . The actors whom he manipulates are like the wooden dolls that sometimes illustrate staid sex manuals - except that in Southern 's handling there are seldom only two dolls per frame . <P> The book 's best sections deal with Hollywood . Southern 's sideswipes are nearly as crude as his characters and just as exuberant . His ear for trade talk is perfect . The book bristles with monstros , nifties and thesps used , but never overused , at moments of shattering incongruity . Though he really has no new targets , Southern can skewer venality- as Producer Sid would put it- seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
