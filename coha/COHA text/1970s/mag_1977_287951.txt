Yet a bruising fight for Senate ratification lies ahead <P> In the sun-swept presidential suite of Panama City 's Holiday Inn , overlooking a bay speckled with shrimp boats , the mood was clearly jubilant . Chief Panamanian Negotiator Romulo Escobar Bethancourt jumped to his feet and reached across the table to grasp the outstretched hands of U.S. Negotiators Ellsworth Bunker and Sol Linowitz . With a smile that seemed as broad as the canal over which they had been arguing for many months , Escobar proclaimed : " This is good . Here are the people who did it . " <P> That it was done was something of a miracle . After 13 years of often bitter negotiations , " principles of an agreement " on a Panama Canal Treaty were finally signed last week . If the treaty is formally approved-and that could prove a very big " if ' - the fabled " Big Ditch , " supreme symbol of American ingenuity and determination for generations , will gradually come under Panama 's control . <P> Panama 's strongman , General Omar Torrijos Herrera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult as pleasing the " princess who had big feet and asked a shoemaker to find her a shoe small on the outside and large inside . " But the negotiators kept hammering away until the shoe seemed to fit . The treaty will be formally signed later this month or in early September . Torrijos has invited all Latin American heads of state , as well as President Carter , to Panama City for the event , and Carter has indicated that he is willing to go . After the signing ceremony comes what is likely to be the toughest part of all . The accord must be approved by a plebiscite in Panama and by a two-thirds vote in the U.S. Senate , which promises to be a bruising battle . <P> The treaty is very much a compromise - neither a triumph nor a defeat for either side . Not only does it settle a nagging quarrel with Panama , it also removes a major irritant in U.S. relations with Latin America , which regards American control of the canal as a humiliating relic of the colonial era . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period ; there is to be no radical , overnight shift of authority . Said Escobar : " Getting control of the Canal Zone and the canal is one of Panama 's oldest national desires . To generation after generation of Panamanians , the canal has symbolized the country 's national patrimony-in the hands of foreigners . We developed a kind of national religion over the canal . " Linowitz told TIME , " In the world as a whole , Panama is regarded as a colonial enclave . The treaty sets off a whole new relationship between the U.S. and Latin America . We can prove how a great nation can deal magnanimously with a small nation at a time when Third World and North-South relations are at stake . "
