THE ultimate political triumph-overwhelming re-election to the nation 's highest office-was behind him . He had turned a mature 60 and his Inauguration this week for his new and final term was only days away . Yet the question lingered : What was success doing to Richard Nixon ? The early evidence was disturbing . Silent , secretive and still suspicious , he seemed to be reaching , in a mood strangely compounded of euphoria and truculence , for greater power . <P> If that is indeed his intended course , a rare opportunity for more constructive leadership will have been ignored . The President who wins by a landslide and need never run again is in a unique position to use his general popularity to forge a new unity . Confident of his majority support , he can afford to become expansive and even treat his critics generously , appealing to higher motives . Yet all of Nixon 's post-election actions suggest that he is determined to subdue his opponents , defy rather than reason with the Democratic Congress and run the Executive Branch by decree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has every reason to appreciate the vast public support at the polls , he acknowledges no obligation to explain his decisions to his constituents . <P> Much in the imperial Gaullist manner , Nixon granted a rare preInauguration interview to the Associated Press 's Saul Pett . The interview , which Nixon insisted be confined to questions about his mood and personality , proved to be revealing , especially about the President 's post-election feelings . Said Nixon : " After four years of the most devastating attacks on TV , in much of the media , in editorials and columns , and then all that talk in the last two or three weeks of the campaign of the gap narrowing . . . and then whap ! A landslide , 49 states , 61% of the vote ! " He paused , then continued : " You 'd think I 'd be elated . . . Well , you 're so drained emotionally at the end , you ca n't feel much . You 'd think that just when the time comes you 'd have your greatest day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceives the presidency , as well as his whole career , that letdown must never be allowed to prevail . There must always be a new challenge ; it is all a constant battle . " I believe in the battle , " he said in the interview , " whether it 's the battle of a campaign or the battle of this office , which is a continuing battle . It 's always there wherever you go . I , perhaps , carry it more than others because that 's my way . " <P> The interview may reinforce the analysis of Political Scientist James Barber , who has tagged Nixon an " active-negative " President , one who gains little satisfaction from his accomplishments , has " a persistent problem in managing his aggressive feelings " and is engaged in " a hard struggle to achieve and hold power . " Others see Nixon as relishing the lonely role of a martyr who suffers constant criticism for doing what he believes to be best for society .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
