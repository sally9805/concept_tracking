txt  | toward self-exhibition and self-expression to relieve emotion and to objectify feeling . It is also allied to instinct , play , and sociability.59 The work of art mediates between the producer and the admirer . It may stimulate unexpected interest and reactions , producing an element of adventure . The instinct for excitement and a longing for novelty , which are present in every human being , encourage the artist to develop new emotions and new means for expressing them , thus initially alluring the observer.00 The pragmatic attitude evaluates the aesthetic moment according to its purpose.61 The meaning of art , however , can never be precisely defined . Thus aesthetic appreciation and logical judgment are notably different . The function of art is to preserve and present meanings at their emotional stage , before they have become explicit , definite , or solved . Art lives on the factors that resist it.62 From a pragmatic point of view , man creates his own life , thus producing , as Oscar Wilde noted , an imitation of art . If art , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophetic than an historic image . After seeing a Turner , Gordon pointed out , one sees more form and color in a sky . Life and nature are experienced , essentially , as products of art.63 In her Esthetics , Gordon regarded aesthetic speculation as a branch of advanced psychology . For her , the essentially creative moment in thinking is that in which the mind sees likenesses , when it perceives a similarity or partial identity that did not appear before . Galileo discovered a likeness between the cathedral lamp and the earth ; Newton , between the falling apple and the planet . Watt found that the steaming of a teakettle might be imitated in a new device ? the locomotive . Similar discoveries occur in artistic composition through the use of analogues and the observation of similarities , as in the development of metaphors and similies.64 Gordon cited the factor that she called " repeat " as one of the important characteristics of poetry . This conception covers rhyme , assonance , refrain , and recurrence of phrases ; it also takes into account emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic imagination is rendered sensuous by rhythm , rhyme , assonance , and thought imagery , as in Keats 's " The Eve of St. Agnes . " 6J  | Figures of speech or tropes are not merely ornamental ; they are essential parts of literary thought . When the mode of conceiving a subject is capable of definite elaboration and exact proof , a scientific statement results ; but when the comparison , or mode of conceiving , is new ( and not destined for further definition or proof ) a literary statement is necessary . Gordon believed that literary comparisons are suggestive and scientific ones definitive ? that poetic thought often initiates a comparison that , when taken up by scientific thought , is reduced to a critical restatement . Critical thought , said Gordon , is the reduction of tropes to facts . She quoted Gertrude Buck 's statement that " figures represent a necessary intermediate stage in every completed process of thought . " As Goldsmith noted , " Passion itself is very figurative . " " Gordon was not quite successful in her analysis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further research on the psychology of art as a means of accounting for the influence of these elements on poetry.67 In prose , Gordon found , the principal sources of pleasure are rhythm and assonance , as in the works of Browne , Pater , and Ruskin . Browne 's rhythms are stately and orchestral ; Pater 's are incantatory ( reminiscent of Browne ) and graceful ; while Ruskin 's are marked by a cumulative intensity. ? 8 Such elements may be present even in the essay , and the development of thought itself ? through induction , complication , exposition , elaboration , climax , and conclusion ? may be presented in highly artistic fashion , U9 as in the writings of William James and Bergson . Again , Gordon noted that the artist transmutes and transfigures the objects with which he deals . His reality is creation , not imitation.70 William Davis Furry ( 1873 ? 1940 ) Furry 's thought represented an attempt to deal with the continuing philosophical problem of dualism ? the conflict between content and form , existence and thought.71 In his principal work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious determination in which the two aspects of thought ( content and control ) are  | recognized and reconciled by the rise of a new mode of immediate experience . The essential character of this type of experience is the " semblant " 72 treatment of meanings already present for the sake of obtaining further meaning . Furry claimed that the aesthetic experience had passed through a series of stages of development at each of which it reflected the principal epistemological problem then present . Because the aesthetic experience is neither theoretical nor practical , it can reconcile these two areas of human activity , bringing about a unity in man 's mind.73 Thus the aesthetic experience produces a form of life richer and more complete than that provided by thought or will or both together , because in it the " genetic dynamogenies as well as the static dualisms are mediated. " 74 Furry cited A. E. Taylor 's definition of consciousness as , in its first appearance , immediate and a-dualistic . As William James noted , " The child does not see light , but is light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the separation of the outer world as a thing apart from our feelings had not even begun . " In James Mark Baldwin 's Thought and Things James was also quoted : " Pure experience is the name which I give to the original flux of life before reflection has categorized it . . . . Pure experience . . . is but another name for feeling or sensation . " 75 Furry , following these views , sought a unity of consciousness in the aesthetic experience . He agreed with Baldwin that new dualisms would arise , but these would be of fact , not of meaning.76 As we have seen in this chapter , a number of American aestheticians have brought fruitful insights to their subject . Ormond called attention to the use of symbolism and analogy long before Susanne Langer ( who leaned , in this respect , on Ernst Cassirer ) . Gates helped to promulgate the idea of literature as organic growth . The genetic approach to poetry and the emphasis on the central role of metaphor in it was Gummere 's contribution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literary aesthetics , presented a cogent view of the differentia of poetry and prose . Puffer made the interesting suggestion of aesthetic repose representing an equilibrium or  | balance of forces . Like Ormond , she proposed a unitary theory of the beautiful , recognizing the close union of form and idea . Whereas Santayana regarded beauty as objectified pleasure , Alexander insisted that it is to be found as much in aspiration as in the ideal image . Reminiscent of Puffer , Adams , in discussing the nature of the socalled lyrical cry , spoke of a balance of stimulation and recuperation in the aesthetic experience . She referred to the sense of unity attained at the conclusion of the process as the " pause of satisfaction . " As a pragmatist , Gordon regarded the function of art to be the production of new experience . For her , the artist 's reality is a creation , not an imitation . And Furry , coming to grips with the dualism of content and form , posited the " semblant " as a new mode of experience , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this way , meanings already present yield further meanings .  | CRITICISM AND AESTHETICS Kate Gordon remarked that " criticism may be called the aesthetics of particular cases . " 1 This chapter will examine the aesthetic doctrines of a number of prominent American literary critics . Joel Elias Spingarn ( 1875 ? 1939 ) In 1910 Spingarn , a famous professor of comparative literature at Columbia University , opened his lecture " The New Criticism " with a sentence borrowed from one of Flaubert 's letters : " What dull creatures those college professors are whenever they talk about art . " 2 Clearly , the professor used the shock method to alert his audience of future professors to the necessity of thinking anew about matters critical and aesthetic . In this lecture he declared that the first need in American criticism was for education in aesthetic thinking ; this had to be followed by the scholarly discipline that would provide both a deep national insight and a wide international outlook . Such humane scholarship , as opposed to pedantry , would substitute the quest for a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more urgently required , according to Spingarn , was a deepened sensibility that would counteract the prevailing deadness of artistic feeling . To this end he called for the development of taste , by which he meant not the so-called good taste of the dilettante and amateur collector but the quality of the creative moment shared by both the artist and the observer.3 In undertaking the difficult task of providing a definition of taste , Spingarn attempted to avoid mistaking virtuous platitudes for art . He accepted no facile generalizations about the place of poetry , for example , among the humanities . The true critic , he believed , would see the essential unity of art , philosophy , religion , and morals in the life of the spirit . Such a critic , in his search for beauty , would be satisfied with nothing less than truth.4 Throughout history , Spingarn suggested , impressionism ( or enjoyment ) and dogmatism ( or judgment ) represented opposite approaches to criticism , although the idea of expression is irnplicit in both.5 The German aestheticians first conceived criticism as the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often obscured , as Croce had shown.6 Spingarn noted that Croce 's aesthetic called for an inversion of the statement art is expression to the declaration that expression is art . This revolutionary approach dispensed with such elements as " rules , " " conventions , " and " genres . " It rejected the idea of technique as separate from art , discarded the concept of literary " evolution , " and condemned the old division between genius and taste. ? " Genius is to aesthetics what the ego , is to philosophy , the only supreme and absolute reality , " said Schelling . Spingarn , following this view , suggested that while criticism could examine certain aspects of the nature of art , it could not discover the source of its power.8 Some years later , however , Spingarn modified these views . In 1922 he wrote that at the time of his earlier work " the pedants and the professors were in the ascendant " and that the critical writer was obliged to assist the creative artist . By the 1920s the pendulum had swung from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative work as if they were describing fireworks or a bullfight.  | The critic therefore had to insist on discipline , knowledge , and thought , as in Spingarn 's " Essay on the Divergence of Criticism and Creation . " 9 Although he asserted that America had neither inherited nor created a tradition of aesthetic thought , he proudly cited those elements of American aesthetics that anticipated modern critical concepts . In particular he praised Jefferson 's literary consciousness , as shown , for example , in a letter to William Wirt ( 1816 ) in which he expressed contempt for artificial canons of criticism and asked only whether a work is animating and interesting . ( For full quotation of this letter , see Chapter 1 ) .10 Spingarn turned next to Poe 's conception of poetry as " the rhythmical creation of beauty " and to Emerson 's kindred idea that beauty , like truth , is " an ultimate end . . . . Beauty is its own excuse for being . " Spingarn recalled Poe 's remark : " The only proper method of testing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting the Poetic Sentiments in others . " Such views , said Spingarn , should warn the critic against overemphasizing the didactic elements of art . He regretted , however , that the views of these American thinkers had not been fully incorporated into the body of American criticism.1 ' Once again , therefore , Spingarn insisted on the importance of truly aesthetic principles in criticism . The latter , as an expression of taste , or that faculty of imaginative sympathy by which the reader relives the vision created by the artist , must be firmly grounded in principle . Even dilettante criticism , however , is preferable to the dogmatic or aridly intellectual criticism of the professors , because the dilettante at least shares some of the artist 's enthusiasm , while the intellectualist or moralist is precluded by his temperament and theories from ever understanding the primal thrill and purpose of the creative act . Logic is not the arbiter of art . Reason and judgment must be accompanied by generous forms of feeling . " Any philosophy of art must be founded on a philosophy of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The true artist , moreover , can transcend the external and moralistic aspects of art . This element of transcendence is , for Spingarn , the test of all art . It is inherent in the very nature of the creative imagination . "  | Albert Mordell ( 1885 ? ) In The Shifting of Literary Values ( 1912 ) Mordell asserted that past literature was " a large mausoleum in which lie the effigies of the old movements , dead beyond resurrection . " 11 Conceptions of beauty change . The modern image of woman , for example , is not that of the age of chivalry . She is no longer the pale , immaculate creature of the knights or the vile object of the monks , and books that present her in this light are false.15 Mordell called for the development of aesthetic principles without regard to the theories of the distant past . He considered Nietzsche , Taine , and Pater greater moralists and stylists than Marcus Aurelius , Bunyan , and Thomas a Kempis . In his view , Goethe , Ibsen , Balzac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tasso.ls Mordell took issue with Victor Hugo , who declared ( in his Shakespeare ) that in Homer and Dante literature reached a clin.ax and that no one can surpass these poets because art is not progressive.17 Mordell found no essential conflict between intellect and feeling , or between poetry and science . The characters of Balzac , he said , are more intensely engrossed in their passions than the characters of Homer , in spite of Balzac 's judgment and intellect . Thought neither stifles the emotions nor corrupts the imagination . Critical acuity does not damage literary performance , as shown in the works of Poe , Coleridge , Heine , and Goethe . Combinations of the critical and imaginative faculties also occur in French literature , in the works of such writers as Voltaire , Diderot , Stendhal , Theophile Gautier , the Goncourts , and Baudelaire . Mordell agreed , then , with others who have held that the literary man discovers new ideas just as the scientist discovers new facts.18 For Mordell , ideas were more important than form . He referred to Pater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who maintained that substance decided greatness in art . The Red and the Black and Crime and Punishment are not remarkable for style , but they are among the greatest literary productions of mankind . Rabelais and Cervantes live solely because of their ideas . Historical criticism , said  | Mordell , has one great fatality ; it attempts to reduce our minds to the level of those whom we have outgrown and finally dulls our judgments.19 Literary criticism is subjective ; it can never become a fixed science . The changing literary reputations of Blake and Stendhal represent a travesty on human judgment . Mordell , recognizing this transitory nature of human judgment , felt that the excessive domination of the classics had led to an atrophied intellectual development and a restriction of artistic growth.20 His attitude recalls that of the Scotch poet John Davidson , who declared that literature would be able to start afresh only when the influence of Shakespeare was dissipated . Edward Howard Griggs ( 1868 ? 1951 ) Griggs 's aesthetic was founded not on a restatement of criticism and philosophy but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the areas mentioned in the title of his book : The Philosophy of Art : The Meaning and Relation of Sculpture , Painting , Poetry and Music ( 1913 ) .21 Using the comparative method , he examined the effect of selected masterpieces on the senses , emotions , imagination , and intellect . For him , all art was expression , but not all expression was art . He offered this definition : Art is the adequate and harmonious expression of some aspect of man 's life or relation to nature , through the medium of personality , in definitely limited form.22 Art is at once real and ideal . It never merely echoes nature , but transmutes it through the medium of the artist 's personality . Resorting to a figure of speech , Griggs said that a work of art is like a wondrous shell thrown up on the shore of time by the ocean of humanity . We hold it to our car and hear the music of the artist 's life and character.23 In so doing , one might add , we also hear the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning and function of music and its relation to the spirit is relevant to an understanding of poetry . Music  | can reveal the infinite , as when Browning 's Abt Vogler speaks of this miracle : " That out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound , but a star . " Griggs frequently cited Lessing on the relationship of poetry to sculpture and painting . The relationship of poetry to music is even closer than to the spatial arts . In relation to the human spirit , poetry is the widest and most universal of the fine arts . Prose , however , can sometimes suggest the union of the arts , in the organlike tones of De Quincey , the North Sea storm in Carlyle , the tableaux of Victor Hugo , and the subtly tender melody in the exquisite prose of Pierre Loti.24 Although each art has its specific function , all must express the unity of the human spirit , which all the arts serve in a common aesthetic cause . The intellect must strive for abstract conceptions , in the effort to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the abstract concept is barren until it is given creative expression in some concrete form . Wagner held that in music drama , poetry and dramatic action constitute the center , with music as an associated art . His disciples held that music was the center , and that the other arts were subordinate to it . Griggs considered the music drama an interesting illustration of the law of evolution from a homogeneous basis , through differentiation , to unity on a higher plane.25 The danger , in art , that the sensuous may pass over into the sensual was symbolized for Griggs in the Witches ' Kitchen scene in Faust . Faust can sec the vision of the ideal body and face only as he stands reverently away from the mirror ; when he steps forward in an attempt to grasp the form , the vision fades . The same truth is expressed in a saying often heard in Parisian studios : " If you want to be an artist , you must hang up your passions with your hat and coat before you enter the Studio . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To drift with every passion till my soul Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play . Is it for this that I have given away Mine ancient wisdom , and austere control ? 27  | Like others before him , Griggs realized the elusive quality of beauty , which escapes definition . It contains something deeper than the principle of the harmony of the parts in a whole . On this point Griggs quoted Emerson 's " Each and All " : I thought of the Sparrow 's note from heaven Singing at dawn on the alder bough ; I brought him home , in his nest , at even ; He sings the song , but it cheers not now . For I did not bring home the river and sky ; ? He sang to my ear , ? they sang to my eye . Griggs echoed Emerson 's organicism and Greenough 's functionalism when the latter spoke of the harmony of an organism to its function , or a thing made to its purpose ? the harmony of content and form : " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rhythm already existing between our senses and the nature of the world . " 28 Despite the difficulty of defining beauty , art helps man to appreciate the world as it is and life as it ought to be . It also helps men to benefit from the healing and exalting influence of beauty . Like Havelock Ellis , Griggs cited one supreme art to which all are called ? the art of living . The service of art , he said , is not limited to the few , but is universal.29 A similar view was expressed in Ellis 's The Dance of Life : " It has always been difficult for Man to realize that his life is all an art . " Ellis borrowed a further observation from Jules de Gaultier : " Morality is a fact of sensibility ; it has no need to have recourse to reason for its affirmations. " 30 George Edward Woodberry ( i 855 ? 1930 ) Woodberry 's ideas were expounded in his address " Two Phases of Criticism : Historical and Esthetic " ( 1913 ) .31 Adverting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art as terms in a temporal series , giving rise to a history of art . Taine 's method emphasized the objective element in the genesis of art . Whereas to the psychologists  | the individual was all , Taine attempted to escape from personality . The former idealized idiosyncrasy as the bound and substance of genius , causing criticism to lose itself in biography and medicine . Thus Woodberry suggested Freud and Max Nordau when he remarked that defective , delinquent , degenerate genius seemed hunted to his lair in the subconscious self . In addition to the sociologists and the psychologists , Woodberry cited a third group ( really a hybrid of the other two ) , namely , the comparatists . These men have been preoccupied with such key figures as Petrarch , Rousseau , and Goethe , and with the intricate problems of influences between nations and epochs . The tendency among such scholars to dissect literary works has often turned criticism into a mere anatomy of texts . In all these divagations , criticism became ever more removed from the work of art . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the matter of knowledge . If the purpose of criticism is to obtain an understanding of the state of mind of a man at a past moment , the historical criticism becomes an indispensable preliminary 32 While citing the importance of such an approach , 33 however , Woodberry remarked that especially in the world of art , which is the most intense realm of life , one is often inclined to ask : " Is there no rescue from the reign of death which is history , and how shall it be accomplished ? " 34 He asked further whether critics are mistaken when they relegate art to the dead past and translate it into history ? Does the personality of art , like the human personality , change in time ? He declared that the revolt against the historical treatment of art arises from a belief that in such a treatment art loses its own nature and is degraded into mere knowledge.35 Through expression , the artist externalizes his mind . His work of art becomes part of the external world . An observer 's re-creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has the artist 's soul ; he is not merely a spectator , but a participant . A new poem suggests new powers of feeling , evoking a fresh passion for life , a transforming and exalting power . Thus , whereas the end of science is to know , the end of art is to be.36 I might add , however , that art does provide the feeling that some-  | thing new has been revealed , suggesting a deeper knowledge of life . The I think is added to the I feel in a combination that constitutes true being . The artist 's discovery of life therefore depends , I believe , on both knowledge and feeling . This combination makes art a growth of freedom and gives it , as Woodberry said , a prophetic quality.37 William Crary Brownell ( 1851 ? 1928 ) In Brownell 's view , the historical method , for all its services , has two erroneous tendencies . Imposing its historical theory on literary and aesthetic facts , it discerns their historical rather than their essential character . It accepts its " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its concern.38 History , moreover , can not be divorced from psychology , any more than aesthetics can be separated from philosophy . The so-called document is itself a semantic sign and as such is functionally and intimately related to the aesthetic experience . Brownell noted that history itself ( sometimes referred to as philosophy teaching by example ) often suffered from the submergence of its examples by its philosophy 39 He followed Sainte-Beuve 's observation that the business of criticism is to occupy itself with examples and ideas associated with them , not with theories and the systems they threaten . Thus , for Brownell , the crown of critical achievement is the solution of the mystery of human personality.40 In his view , critical practice , fortified by general culture , seeks to establish initially some central conception of the subject , follows with an analysis of detail confirming or modifying this conception , and concludes with a balanced synthesis . This process is based on a standard of reason that rules out individual whim or formulated prescriptions . As exemplars of this rational approach Brownell cited Saint-Beuve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure good sense " as Francisque Sarcey and Emile Faguet.41 Such writers , he believed , represent the optimum union of the aesthetic and the historical in criticism . In his book Standards ( 1917 ) Brownell asserted that criteria belong to sense rather than to reason . They are felt as ideal exemplars  | for measurement by comparison , not deduced as criteria of absolute authority . He noted an instinctive hostility to standards , arising from the tension that conformity imposes both on the artist and on the appreciator of art . Standards also seem to conflict with spontaneity and the vital outflow of energy . He alluded to two types of spontaneity , however : that of an elevated order and that of an elementary order.42 On this categorization , he quoted Edouard Manet : " People desire to popularize art , without perceiving that art always loses in height what it gains in breadth . " Further , in his discussion of the " elevated order , " Brownell cited Gide 's observation that " the admirable French tradition " of good taste was maintained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court of Louis XIV and the free naturalism of the general public ( the pit ) .43 At one time , said Brownell , the art-loving public consisted of cultivated people : their standards were narrow , but they had standards . In the modern public the elements least sensitive to art and letters are disproportionately large . Brownell blamed this condition on the prevalance of vocational training and specialization , which usurped the place of the liberal arts in the educational system . As a result , contemporary society has no real community of educated people with common intellectual interests and standards . The present public demands sensation , novelty , " something different . " Brownell discussed the emotional nature of this recoil from disciplined thought and noted the widespread feeling that intellectual standards are undemocratic.44 He deplored the disappearance of the sense of awe from the inner life of modern man . Few of his contemporaries , he remarked , shared Kant 's rapture over the starry heavens and the moral law.45 Brownell admitted , however , that to deny the need of new standards would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution was to increase the " remnant " in art and letters and to spread the standards ; otherwise art would be reduced to a standardless caprice . The artist who functions for himself alone has obtained his catharsis , but has not provided one for his fellow man , as Aristotle urged . Because mankind as a whole is wider than any one man ,  | its cooperation in arts and letters is quite as important as that of their professional representatives . As an example of a true community , Brownell cited France , where an entire people is animated by the perpetual renewal of a national art.46 This renewal results from a constant shift of standards beyond the comfort and smugness of the individual . Such a shift can be achieved only by the individual , however , as Max Eastman suggested when he urged Americans to make their own poetry . Following this view , Brownell observed that it is best to do one 's thinking in solitude ? in solitude but not in isolation from the concerns of mankind.47 Van Wyck Brooks ( 1886 ? 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of American culture , which he described in his essay " The Critics and Young America " ( 1917 ) .48 Anticipating many writers of the 196os , he wondered whether the older generation ever suspects the existence of an inherent weakness in a culture that has so lost control of a really well-disposed younger generation as to leave in its wake a society so little civilized . How does it happen , Brooks asked , that we who are gradually becoming receptive to so many influences of the past feel the chill of the grave ( or , as Alfred Stieglitz once put it to me , " the smell of the morgue " ) as we look back over the spiritual history of our own race ? 49 Our field of action has been preempted by our acquisitive instincts , and we have never developed a national fabric of spiritual experience . As a result , we are unable to think and feel in international terms . We share only vicariously in the heritage of civilization . We have flocked around Carlyle , Browning , Meredith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing real to us because we have nothing in our lives to make their message real.5 ? One thinks of Frost 's remark that America failed to produce a Dostoyevski because of nothing less than too much comfort . Literature with us is either an amusement or a soporific . Our slogan is : Let 's  | have cheerfulness and forgetfulness . American writers live in a world of externalities . Could one ask , said Brooks , for a more essential declaration of artistic bankruptcy ? 51 Our industrial process has produced a poor quality of human nature . In Europe , on the other hand , the human spirit has been kept alive by a long line of rebels , such as Nietzsche , Ernest Renan , William Morris , Rodin , Marx , and Mill , who have reacted violently to the desiccating influences of the industrial system . Rebelling against the oppressive conditions of their environment , they have been able to keep alive the tradition of a great society by assimilating for human uses the positive by-products of industrialism itself ? science and democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their lives , they built a bridge between the greatness of the few in the past and the greatness of the many , perhaps in the future . Thus the democracies of Europe rose above their dead selves . In America the only son of Abraham Lincoln , who liberated the slaves politically , became the president of the Pullman Company and was the first to exploit the freed men industrially . Throughout his essay Brooks charged that our environment has given us personally no sense of the significance of life.52 ( But , when one is mindful of a Europe that produced Hitler , Mussolini , and Stalin , then Brooks 's remarks are in need of revision . ) Now that the acquisitive life had lost the sanction of pioneering necessity , Brooks felt that his age ( 1917 ) called for intensive cultivation of the creative life . But for that , Brooks lamented , how illequipped we are ! The young found themselves born into a race that had drained away all its spiritual resources in a struggle to survive , and so continued to struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed any other meaning . " 3 In this essay , as we can now see , Brooks clearly forecast many of the dominant concerns of the 197os . These concerns were adumbrated in most of his writings , including The Flowering of New England and New England Indian Summer . He pointed out that the gospel of self-expression , makeshift though it be , has revealed a promise in America that has been taken too much for granted .  | America 's task is to build a program for the conservation of our spiritual resources.54 Irving Babbitt ( 1865 ? 1933 ) The question of self-expression and spontaneity in art , as well as the restraining role of discipline ? all of which arise in the reflections of Spingarn , Brownell , and Brooks ? became especially important in Babbitt 's writings , notably in his essay " Genius and Taste . " 55 Here he made Spingarn and his master Croce the special butts of his argument , attacking their exaltation of spontaneity and free expression , and describing them as primitivists . He quoted Diderot : " Genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 According to the primitivist , the genius must let himself go both imaginatively and emotionally , and the whole business of the critic is to receive so keen an impression from the resulting expression that , when passed through his temperament , it issues forth as a fresh expression . By participating in the creative thrill of genius , the critic becomes creative in turn , and insofar as this situation occurs , genius and taste are one , as they were for Spingarn . Babbitt noted , however , that Schlegel 's similar view antedated that of Croce and Spingarn by at least a century , especially in his declaration that genius and taste are " indivisibly one . " Babbitt found , moreover , that Spingarn 's aesthetic closely paralleled Oscar Wilde 's in The Critic as Artist , which concluded that " Criticism is the only civilized form of autobiography . " 57 Babbitt maintained that the basis of the whole movement from the original genius of the eighteenth century to Wilde and Spingarn was the craving for an indeterminate vagabondage of imagination and emotion ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or central control . Thus Spingarn 's ideas on genius and taste encourage conceit or megalomania , which Babbitt found to be extremely dangerous , especially when a whole nation comes to feel its intoxication as an ecstatic " idealism . " 58 The whole conception of genius and taste had about it , for Babbitt ,  | the flavor of a decadent aestheticism . Using Arnold 's phrase , he attacked the term " creative critic " as " the grand name without the grand thing . " In an age marked by the disintegration of traditional values , the critic must be creative in an important sense ; he must create standards with the aid of the ethical imagination . Critic and creator are truly united in their common allegiance to critical standards.59 Spingarn declared that the opening night of the International Exhibition of 1913 was one of the most " exciting adventures " he had ever experienced . For Babbitt , such an attitude represented a late stage of a movement that from its rise in the eighteenth century was unable to distinguish between the original and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a stale eccentricity . Is this country , he asked , always to be the dumping ground of Europe ? Can we not create our own standards , without such primitivistic affirmations as Spingarn 's statement that the " art of a child is art quite as much as that of Michelangelo " ? so Clearly , Babbitt placed Spingarn among the corrupters of the literary conscience , ' among those who made the imagination the irresponsible accomplice of the unchained emotions.61 Many will agree that when Babbitt spoke of art as creating " the illusion of a higher reality , " he meant by " higher reality " that sanctioned by Calvinism ; whereas Spingarn , who also believed in the creative illusionism of art , meant illusion sanctioned by the human spirit free of all parochialism . Thomas Stearns Eliot ( 1888 ? 1965 ) Eliot , a pupil of Babbitt and Santayana at Harvard , headed his essay " The Perfect Critic " with a quotation from Remy de Gourmont 's Letters to the Amazon : " To build into laws personal impressions is the great effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , for Eliot , the artist is to be depended on as a critic ; his criticism will be objective evaluation , not merely the satisfaction of a suppressed desire . Eliot supported this view with a further quote from Gourmont : " The  | writer whose style is abstract is almost always a sentimentalist , at least a sensitive soul . The writer who is an artist is practically never a sentimentalist , and very rarely a sensitive soul . " 63 Much of Eliot 's thought was derived from Coleridge , whom he regarded as perhaps the greatest of English critics . Eliot felt , however , that Coleridge 's metaphysical interest was tinged with emotions . He declared that a literary critic should have no emotions except those immediately provoked by a work of art . Everything that Aristotle said , for example , illuminated the literature that is the occasion for saying it . Such a statement is only occasionally true of Coleridge . For Eliot , Aristotle was the prototype of the scientific , or as Eliot would have said , the intelligent mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his remarkable combination of sensitiveness , erudition , sense of fact and sense of history , and generalizing power ? all factors , apparently , that in Eliot 's opinion combined to make the great critic . The critic , said Eliot , should have a superior sensibility to impressions.64 He observed further that the two directions of sensibility ? criticism and creativity ? are complementary . Sensibility , however , is rare , unpopular , and desirable ; the critic and the creative artist are therefore frequently the same person . Eliot obviously had himself in mind as that representative individual when he remarked that the poetic critic criticizes poetry in order to create poetry . He believed , moreover , " historical " and " philosophical " critics had better be called historians and philosophers quite simply.65 Emphasizing the importance of literary tradition , Eliot maintained that the best parts in a poet may be those in which his ancestors ( the dead poets ) asserted their immortality most vigorously . Thus a poet can not be evaluated apart from his relation to a tradition . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aesthetic , not merely historical criticism . " He noted in addition that the past is altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past , 66 and he expressed his sense of the aesthetic of history : the historic imagination transposes , transmutes , and rearranges past events . An awareness of such a metamorphosis , Eliot suggested , is essential for the poet .  | Eliot attempted to eliminate personal emotion from the enjoyment of poetry , citing Arnold 's description of the highest purpose of art : to see the object as it really is , " to see life clearly and see it whole . " Bad criticism is , for Eliot , only an expression of emotion.67 The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice , a continual extinction of personality , as in the remark by Keats that the poet has no " personality . " In this depersonalization , art approaches the condition of science . Here Eliot used the analogy of the catalyst , which causes chemical compounds to combine , forming a new compound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the newly formed compound contains no trace of the catalyst , which is apparently unaffected by the combination . The mind of the poet , Eliot believed , is such a catalyst . It may operate partly or exclusively on the experience of the man himself , but the more accomplished the artist , the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates ? the more perfectly will the mind digest and transmute the passions that are its material.68 The poet is only a medium ( not a personality ) in which impressions and experiences combine in peculiar and unexpected ways.ss Thus , Eliot asserted , the business of the poet is not to find new emotions , but to use the ordinary ones and , in working them up into poetry , to express feelings that are not in actual emotion at all . The obscurity of this conception of emotion , together with Eliot 's indication that only a rare individual can recognize an expression of significant emotion , 70 suggests that he credited very few people with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an understanding of the philosophy or aesthetic of that art . Henry Louis Mencken ( 188o ? 1956 ) Mencken , an aggressive , epigrammatic journalist , was also an admirer of the lyrical and even the sentimental in literature and music . Secretly respecting the philological scholarship that he outwardly  | derided , he was dominated by Nietzsche and by his love for music . For him , the ideal critic , like the artist , was capable of expressing his inner compulsions articulately and with a positive sense of the importance of the self.7 ' Because the feelings of the critic are largely derived from those of other men , as expressed in art , he must , said Mencken , possess the intellectual agility and enterprise that will allow him to move from the work of art to the vast and mysterious complex of phenomena behind it . Lacking this capacity , he remains " no more than a fugleman or policeman to his betters . " If the critic , however , possesses something of the genuine artist in himself , he will inevitably move from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will therefore acquire a dignity that it would not otherwise attain . The critic , then , is an artist whose self-expression comprises both art and life . Through him one work of art begets another , and in this sense the object before the true critic is always less interesting than the feelings within him.72 In Mencken 's view , such a critic does not force a work of art to conform with any transient theory of aesthetics . Rather , he attempts to relieve his own tensions , transforming them into " plausible " and ingratiating expressions , therefore gaining the attention and respect of his equals . The works of such critics as Carlyle and Macaulay are notable for their charm ? a quality that Mencken found much more important than truth . Indeed , he believed that criticism should be less concerned with discovering truth than with exposing error , 73 because , in aesthetics , nothing is permanently true . Mencken attributed the vitality of such diverse works as Hamlet , the Mona Lisa , Faust , " Dixie , " Parsi f al , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to correct demeanor but to the quality of creative passion that emanates from them . In recognition of this quality , the critic should produce writings based on sound structure and marked by the charm of an uncommon and independent personality . Mencken noted again that he could not imagine any aesthetic idea that is palpably and incontrovertibly sound , and he declared that no artist has ever improved his work as a result of so-called constructive criticism.74  | Although Mencken thus seems to have derogated the idea of a " science " of aesthetics , he nevertheless welcomed a renaissance of the doctrine that aesthetic matters are important , and that a man might do well to take them seriously . He cited the importance of conflict in aesthetic issues , as during the period when , he said , literature was kept alive by the dispute between Poe and those he criticized . In a later period , when Howells , mild-mannered and beneficent , was the typical critic , literature survived upon the tomb of the Puritan culture . Mencken conjectured that if Poe had been surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hollow as Woodberry 's . It took the unfair and sometimes dishonorable opposition of Rufus Wilmot Griswold to stimulate Poe to his highest efforts . And Mencken hailed the critical strife of his own day ( the 1920s ) , which no longer allowed the Paul Elmer Mores and Hamilton Wright Mabies to " purr in peace . " 75 In the article " Criticism of Criticism of Criticism , " 76 Mencken pointed to the divergent views of the critics on their own art , which are as varied as their views of the other arts . One group tries to police the fine arts according to moral principles . Another demands that they be concerned with beauty only . Still another declares that a literary work is a psychological document and should help man to know himself . A fourth group reduces criticism to an exact science.77 Refuting the moralistic critics , Mencken quoted Spingarn 's Creative Criticism : " To say that poetry is moral or immoral is as meaningless as to say that an equilateral triangle is moral and an isosceles triangle is immoral . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cauliflower would be good if it had only been prepared in accordance with international law . " He particularly attacked " Prof. Dr. W. C. Brownell , the Amherst Aristotle , with his eloquent plea for standards as iron-clad as the Westminster Confession . " 78 Mencken classed Brownell with such writers as William Lyon Phelps , Percy H. Boynton , Stuart Pratt Sherman , and Paul Elmer More , for whom , he said , criticism was little more than a branch of homiletics.79 Despite some reservations , Mencken generally admired Spingarn , for whom " aesthetic judgment and artistic creation are instinct with the same vital life . " Spingarn , of course , erred in his failure to recog-  | nize fully the social and even the moral implications of art . The finale of Beethoven 's C-Minor Symphony , for example , is not only colossal as music ; it is also colossal as revolt . It says something against something . Still , as Mencken admitted , Spingarn did dissipate many false views and came closer to the truth than his colleagues.8 ? The critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in Poe , Mencken found a sensitive and intelligent artist who could re-create the work of other artists . For Mencken , however , Huneker 's use of the word " creative " seemed somewhat flamboyant . He would have substituted " catalytic , " because for him , as in some respects for Eliot , the critic acts as a catalytic agent to initiate a reaction between two elements ? the work of art and the spectator . Thus the critical process should produce the very factors that the artist has attempted to convey : understanding , appreciation , and intelligent enjoyment.81 In general , Mencken 's strident criticism of American culture helped to create an awareness of its weaknesses as well as of its possibilities for aesthetic improvement . This chapter has presented a wide spectrum of critical opinion . Spingarn , a disciple of Croce , maintained that the philosophy of art must be based on a philosophy of life , while Mordell regarded the worship of the past as an incubus on the free development of ideas . For him there was no conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that the historical treatment of art obscured its nature by degrading it to mere knowledge . The prophetic quality of art was the result of the combination of knowledge and feeling . Brownell envisioned human personality in the heart of critical achievement . What mattered was art rather than any system of viewing it . He was equally opposed to rigidity of standards and to standardless caprice . Brooks was chiefly concerned with the oppressive effect of industrialism on the creative process . Accordingly , he warned against the easy dismissal of self-expression in the arts . In the " creative criticism " sponsored by Spingarn , Babbitt could only see a vagabondage of emotion and imagination . The illusion of a " higher reality " in art needed , in Babbitt 's view , an " inner check " ( that of Calvinism ) , whereas for Spingarn it needed freedom from all parochialism.  | T. S. Eliot maintained that the true mark of the critic and the creative artist ( essentially the same person ) was the possession of a higher sensibility . Eliot was obscure in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were not at all in actual emotion . Mencken saw the critic as one who was able to move from the work apart to the complex phenomena behind it . His aesthetic ideal , a combination of good sense , urbanity , and lyricism , aimed especially to counteract the crass materialism of the " booboisie. "  | AESTHETICS AS A UNIFYING VISION James Mark Baldwin ( 1861 ? 1934 ) Baldwin 's philosophy was directed " to all those who find Art the Noblest Instrument of the Spiritual Life . " ' His aesthetic theory , which he called " pancalism " ( from the Greek meaning " all beautiful " ) was based on a reasoned approach to art . He particularly admired the theory of affective logic ( a logic that takes emotion into account ) , which , he noted , is distinctly French , just as Fin fuhlung ( empathy ) is distinctly German . The aestheticians Theodule Ribot and Theodor Lipps were respectively connected with these influential movements in psychological and aesthetic theory.2 Baldwin believed that only the aesthetic experience can reunite " self-reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or external control ) , which are divided in the process of intellectual analysis . The aesthetic imagination rejects the incomplete knowledge offered by narrow cognition . Indeed , as studies in affective logic have shown , the aesthetic element in man has generally been the unifying force in the dualisms created by the partial motives of cognitive and practical interest.3 The sense of reality is based on interest and satisfaction . The mind comprehends actuality through the imagination ? the vehicle of the prospecting , postulating , schematizing , and desiring functions .  | Through these functions , man 's perceptions of actualities are enlarged , defined , and enriched . Thus the scientific imagination not only discovers the true but also postulates the ideal of truth . Reality is progressive , unfinished , and dynamic . It has an ideal meaning , which is never actually achieved either through mere knowledge , which is excessively confining , or through mere freedom of thought , which excludes profound insights . A true sense of reality is neither impersonal nor capricious .4 Although Baldwin generally aligned himself with the instrumentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called attention to their limitations . He declared that philosophy should not disparage certain functions to dignify others . Men , he said , should be informed by knowledge and moved by feeling , not divided between the two . In this approach Baldwin recalls Lotze , who also rejected partial solutions to the problem of human existence. ? Baldwin 's Genetic Theory of Reality ( 1915 ) showed that by their very nature the categories of thought ignore and disparage the most direct experiences of life , resulting in a stifling of cognition . In the rivalry between rationalism ( based on the intuition of " pure reason " ) and voluntarism ( based on " practical reason " ) , imagination again constitutes a unifying force between cognition and mechanism . It merges the ideals of thought in the intense perception of aesthetic contemplation , forming a reality of reconciliation and completeness . Men comprehend the real through their enjoyment of the beautiful. ? Aesthetic contemplation is concerned solely with immediate perception . Reflective knowledge , unable to solve its own contradictions , reconstructs its objects in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certain " secondary presuppositions " always " haunt the house of every ontological theory of reality . " The aesthetic experience knows no " other " than its own object ; the relation of subject to object is part of its content , but it is not itself subject to this distinction . Its higher immediacy and completeness deny the relativities of inner and outer , earlier and later , actual and ideal , true and false , affirmative and negative , good and bad . The world , said Baldwin , can not remain incoherent , disorganized , and radically pluralistic , if it becomes artistic and beautiful. ? Baldwin 's affectivism denied the competence of either reason or  | will to serve as an exclusive organ of reality . He asserted that an immediate synthesis of function is found in aesthetic contemplation , a state that may be described as one of feeling . This feeling had too often been left at the level of impulse or regarded as an empty form of transcendental reason , instead of being considered in its true role as an instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would express the ideals of the will in a union of cognition and feeling . Through such a theory , the two great currents of affectivism ? the mystical and the rational ? would be joined. ? Baldwin cited Wilbur M. Urban 's prospect of a " Beautiful Vision " ensuing from " a form of contemplation which transcends will and thought alike " and which must be the goal of all metaphysics . Pancalism , then , was yet another organic approach to aesthetics , through which man could express the whole of his nature in the awareness brought by his sense of beauty. ? DeWitt Henry Parker ( 1885 ? 1949 ) A pupil of William James , Royce , Santayana , and Ralph Barton Perry at Harvard , Parker moved slowly toward a theory of beauty , publishing his Principles of Aesthetics in 1920 . In that year I took Parker 's course in which this work was used as a text . I can still recall the quiet flame that seemed to burn as Parker spoke . He communicated aesthetic ideas without the narrowly logical obfuscation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matters of great moment were stated simply and explicitly . The subject was always man 's abiding fascination for beauty . For Parker , as for Baldwin , feeling was of paramount importance . Apparently influenced by Coleridge 's idea of the " willing suspension of disbelief , " he indicated that aesthetic belief implies an abandon sufficient to allow the suggestibility of a work of art to work on our feelings . He attached the same meaning to the terms " experience of art , " " aesthetic experience , " and " beauty . " 10 For him , art involved value judgment based on selection and comparison . Although he stated at one point that a work of art is a logical  | system , he also noted that its purpose is sympathetic vision , not scientific truth or edification : " The tyranny of the scientific and the moral is the death of art . " He was quick to add , however : " I do not mean , of course , that art may not express the mystery and the wonder of science . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous remark that Descartes , as the personification of science , cut the throat of poetry.11 In his concrete application of aesthetic theory to the arts , Parker began with music , believing that all arts contain a musical element . He suggested that a succession of tones comes to express the changing process of the inner life . Here Parker followed the general as well as the detailed ideas of Schopenhauer , Lotze , Wilhelm Wundt , and Lipps in holding that " music expresses the abstract aspects of action in all its divagations " and that the " content of music becomes not a mere form of life , but life itself . " 12 Music and poetry are akin in that both are arts of sound with rhythm as the principle of their order . They are twin-born in song . The incursion of definite meaning in poetry differentiates it from music . We may argue , however , that the powerful impact of poetry very often results in suggestions that are not at all clearly defined ? that poetry is , in fact , like music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker described the four basic functions of words : ( 1 ) the expression of sound and movement ( heard and uttered ) , ( 2 ) the embodiment of meaning ( concrete or abstract ) , ( 3 ) the communication of total experience ( the self as well as the object ) , and ( 4 ) the suggestion of transcendental meaning in concrete images . This definition of words as articulations of sound and meaning , expressive of feeling and evocative of images , led Parker to a study of sound , meaning , feeling , and imagery in a synthetic view of the nature and function of poetry.14 The best poems , Parker believed , are at once musical , imaginative , and thoughtful . The various elements are often in conflict , however : the music may obscure the thought ; the meaning may become vague because of an overelaboration of imagery ; and both imagery and euphony may be shut out by subtlety of thought . Swin-  | burne , for example , covered philosophical thought with sensuousness and musicality , while in Browning subtlety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music and imagery.15 Thus lyric poetry shows nature as merely a reflection of moods . Its subject matter is identifiable with its musical expressiveness . Even dramatic poetry contains an important lyrical element . In both forms , life seems to move in the actual present , whereas in the epic the time of the storyteller ( the present ) and that of the events he relates ( the past ) constitute a duality . " Prose rhythm is fundamentally " a rhythmical movement of ideas . " In this it resembles poetry , but without its regularization . Parker seems to have suggested a developmental charm in which the progressive links are words ( language ) , ideas ( thought ) , and images , as in poetry . Parker used a telling metaphor to describe the beauty of prose in relation to its content : " The transparent medium of prose shares the beauty of its content , just as a perfect glass partakes of the color of the light which it transmits . " Because prose literature lacks , for the most part , the musical element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That very lack , however , enables it to represent life fully and in detail : " The unmusical character of prose style is not determined by weakness , but by adaptation to function . " 17 Prose fiction , which represents a psychological need for self-revelation , is basically related to history , although imaginative inventiveness makes it less than completely factual . In Parker 's estimation , fiction is a compensation for loneliness and boredom ; yet it is not unrelated to the world of reality . We might say with Valery that fiction ( really poetry ) is a musicalization of experience . By delineating life , the art of fiction clearly becomes a criticism of life . " Herbert Sidney Langfeld ( 1879 ? 1958 ) In The Aesthetic Attitude ( 1920 ) Langfeld declared that the aesthetic experience is enriched through a knowledge of the-nature of appreciation . Attempting to show that " the perception of beauty is  | one of the most useful of man 's experiences , " he suggested that the nature of an individual 's artistic response depends to some extent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langfeld asserted : The Romanticists are correct in their belief that appreciation as well as production of works of art should be intuitive ... . Artistic response is a direct perception . . . whatever may have been the preceding intellectual preparation.20 At the same time he agreed with the intellectualists that an observer should have a rational background for response , and he indicated that the two positions can be reconciled . He followed John Livingston Lowes , who observed that the artist " must hold an imperial sway over his impressions , selecting , clarifying , ordering , moulding , filing and refiling them . " 21 Langfeld recognized that psychological analysis did not furnish all the data necessary for aesthetic appreciation . Thus he felt that Allen 's Physiological Aesthetics ignored most of the problems of aesthetic enjoyment , including the nature of beauty . Among those who had made progress toward a theory ( or at least a description ) of beauty , Langfeld singled out Hugo Munsterberg , Puffer , and Edward Bullough . He admitted the cogency of the theory of repose advanced by Munsterberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic object through its detachment and isolation from its surroundings . He argued , however , that one is hardly in an isolated attitude in the case of the drama , with its rising tension . Bullough 's theory of " psychical distance " ( not unrelated to the theory of repose ) was , for Langfeld , one of the most valuable descriptions of the conditions underlying beauty . The term " distance " was used metaphorically , not in a spatial or temporal sense . " Psychical distance " is a condition for aesthetic experience or enjoyment , as when a person on a ship threatened by a storm enjoys the color of the water and the shapes of the waves . At the moment that the waves  | threaten to strike , however , the " psychical distance " is lost and the aesthetic attitude gives way to an attitude of bodily resistance . ( The waves themselves are , of course , both spatial and temporal . ) Another example is that of a man watching Othello and imagining his wife in the place of Desdemona and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetic attitude and has ceased to " repose " in the object . Bullough 's rule of " the antinomy of distance " called for our having as little distance as possible without losing it entirely . Langfeld criticized Bullough 's use of the word " distance " because it covered two distinct facts : the amount of appeal , which is one of the factors underlying the attitude ; and the aesthetic attitude itself . Langfeld 's argument was that we can have varying strength of appeal to our wishes in terms of distance , but we can not have degrees of aesthetic attitude . The less distance , the greater the likelihood of loss of aesthetic attitude.22 On the fundamental aesthetic problem of unity , Langfeld noted that when an observer is confronted with a multiplicity of objects , he becomes restless . Accordingly , he seeks some principle for relating the objects to one another . Thus the quest for monism originates in the psychological need for repose and balance . From this point of view , desire plays itself out in accordance with the aesthetic principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art according to three separate expressions : ( i ) unity of form , ( 2 ) unity of content , and ( 3 ) unity of form and content . Only when the three are brought to perfection is complete aesthetic enjoyment possible . In literature this pleasure is secured only through the genuine unity of mood and a dominant point of view.24 Balance and symmetry are equally important , as in drama , where the strain of conflicting forces should be presented in every scene , so that the major crisis appears as a natural summation of the minor crises depicted throughout the play.25 Beauty , for Langfeld , is primarily a matter of successful unified adjustment to a situation , with an accompanying feeling of aesthetic pleasure . The absence of such an adjustment produces ugliness and aesthetic pain . Beauty is neither in the object nor in the organism ;  | it is a specific relation of the two . Because men differ , different kinds and degrees of beauty will exist . The great function of art is to provide an expressive outlet for the varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladd Buermeyer ( 1889-1969 ) Buermeyer 's The Aesthetic Experience ( 1924 ) indicated that art must be relevant to daily life , in the sense of Ellis 's statement that all arts are a part of life.27 Art thus vivifies an " impoverished and denuded world . " For Buermeyer , aesthetic quality is an aspect of all intelligent or reasonable perception , not a mere embellishment of it . Art is the intelligent transformation of instinct . Man contributes to creation by a sympathetic and imaginative entry into a heterogeneous mass of perception , stabilizing his feelings in the repose that is the condition of art . Like Dewey and Warner Fite , Buermeyer maintained that all experience furnishes occasions for aesthetic appreciation.28 In the midst of the chaos in which men live , they find an area of order that Buermeyer likened to the ring of light about a lamp , which shades off into darkness on every side . Art counterbalances the evasions of life . Through the imaginative grasp and conquest of desire , art compensates men for their tenuous grip on reality ; it offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defining art as expression in a medium of sense , Buermeyer linked it to desire , and matter to form . He suggested that art is conduct and feeling enlightened by " fundamental brain-work . " In this connection he pointed out that romantic love ( as differentiated from sexual attraction ) is the product of those who have given aesthetic expression to fundamental emotions.30 As examples he quoted Marlowe 's description of Helen 's " face that launched a thousand ships , " and Pater , for whom the Mona Lisa suggested " what in the ways of a thousand years men had come to desire . " 31 Following Dewey 's declaration that experience is art , Buermeyer  | declared that art is life : if it is to flourish it must be cultivated by all men . Science and philosophy may also contribute to a vision of unity in the human experience . Indeed philosophers and artists may often express a similar aesthetic intent , as in the cases of Schopenhauer and Thomas Hardy.32 No art of life can exist for slaves , however . Those who see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of art as something apart from life.33 Thomas Munro ( 1897 ? ) Probably no one in America did more to promote study and research in aesthetics than Thomas Munro , the able and energetic editor of the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism , founded in 1941 . His influential Scientific Method in Aesthetics ( 1928 ) discussed the experimental approach to a variety of aesthetic problems , providing a research program that has subsequently been carried out by a number of scholars.34 In his preface Munro expressed his indebtedness to Dewey 's conception of experimental method , of valuation , and of aesthetic experience and to Santayana 's conception of the place of art in the life of reason and of aesthetics in a naturalistic philosophy . In criticism , he cited the works of Albert Coombs Barnes on plastic form , as well as his analysis and historical studies of form in painting . Fully aware of the difference between the " plumbing " of science and its philosophy , Munro , like Einstein , did not discount the attractiveness and function of mystery in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaden what it penetrates , " he said , " let us be in no hurry to extend it to the arts and to the spontaneous enjoyments of life . " For him , scientific method is not absolutely identical with quantitative measurement . In 1876 , Gustav Theodor Fechner proceeded to formulate , in his Introduction to Aesthetics , an aesthetic based on inductive principles and experimental findings , as a result of which he arrived at a series of aesthetic laws , such as unity in variety and the correct mean . Munro believed that Fechner 's quantitative procedure had failed to touch the central problem of artistic value .  | Further , he held that Fechner 's approach and that of metaphysics are remote from the aesthetic experience itself . Art criticism is , he believed , much closer to concrete issues . Even if its " observations " of works of art are mixed with personal feelings , the latter are themselves important to aesthetics . In such criticism , the very lack of systematic method and the clash of standards are facts that a theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was precisely the material of Munro 's journal , which was devoted to " a study of recurrences and variations in human behavior toward works of art . " 35 Although much art criticism prior to Munro had displayed no steady aim or consistent method , he discerned two tendencies in his generation : one toward psychology and the other toward the analysis of form . The first involved genetic explanation , studying the work of art in terms of the artist 's or critic 's personality and " the psychic and environmental mechanisms which determined his product . or judgment ! ' " The second tendency represented a reaction against the psychological approach and a denial of a link between psychology and aesthetics . Some critics did agree , however , to " a sensible use of psychology " in the analysis of form . In general , Munro urged that past theories be utilized as suggestions for further investigation . Thus critics should consider Plato 's theory of the effects of certain kinds of music on the will and Aristotle 's theory of tragedy as catharsis ? the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to present psychoanalytical thought.37 In Munro 's view , form is not a detachable framework but the distinctive " mode of handling " ( Pater 's phrase ) the subject and materials . Perception can be sharpened through the comparison of forms and media , leading to a systematic classification of aesthetic experiences . Munro cautioned , however , against an emotional attachment to definitions , systems , or philosophies that tend to oversimplify developments in the history of art or criticism . The concentrated study of particular works of art should supplement theories of the " romantic , " the " sublime , " or the " decadent. " 38 Munro recognized the general aesthetic significance of psychoanalysis even before it became widely accepted :  | Its technique of exploring the depths of imaginative life , its bold attempt to adapt scientific method to study of phenomena apparently beyond the reach of science , are worthy of respectful consideration by the aesthetic psychologist . Munro suggested further that for the understanding of complex affective responses , general psychology could profit greatly from literature , which , as Freud well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data.39 Finally , on the question of valuation in art and aesthetics , Munro would largely replace general standards with intelligent analysis . He described certain common factors in the experiences of individuals but noted that " general standards of value are , and always must be , used by every one , as a means of bringing to bear the past experience of himself and others . " 40 Certainly , aesthetics can not develop reliable standards of value by coercion . Recognizing this , Munro advocated a systematic comparison of responses to identical forms , thus substituting an experiential approach for abstract theory.41 Such a system of applied aesthetics would not seek to direct the intuitive impulse but would allow it to find its own patterns of adventure and growth , by dissolving the routines of mechanical habit.42 Curt John Ducasse ( 1881 ? 1969 ) For Ducasse , art was not a quality of things but an activity of man . Oddly enough , he held that art does not necessarily seek the creation of beauty , because many works of art are ugly . The creator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not concerned with the creation of beauty but with giving objective expression to his feelings . Beauty itself is variable : some beautiful things are not works of art , and some works of art are not beautiful.43 On the nature of art in relation to language , expression , and feeling , Ducasse examined the work of Eugene Veron , Tolstoi , Jespersen , Grace De Laguna , Max Meyer , Lascelles Abercrombie , and Croce . According to Veron , he noted , art is essentially language that  | originates in cry and gesture . Originally imitative expressions become essentially arbitrary abstract thought and symbols that do not attempt to resemble the objects they represent . Language is then divided into prose and poetry . The former involves the expression of facts and ideas by means of symbols in which the imitative character is attenuated or lost . In the latter , the goal is the expression of the concrete signs abandoned by prose . Veron defined art , as " the emotional expression of human personality . " Artistic genius is the capacity to find expressive forms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection and desire intervene only as later additions . " Art is therefore much wider in scope than beauty . The beautiful does not contain art ; art contains the beautiful , just as it contains the terrible , the sad , the ugly , and the joyous.44 Veron 's aesthetic views , including his understanding of the sincerity of the artist , all reappeared in Tolstoi 's What Is Art ? 45 Ducasse believed Tolstoi may have been influenced by Veron in much larger measure than the few merely critical references in the book would suggest . Through Tolstoi , however , the doctrines of art as the language of feeling and of art as independent of beauty have exerted their greatest influence . Like Veron , Tolstoi declared that art is essentially the language of feeling . Whereas a man transmits his thoughts by words , he transmits his feeling by means of art.46 Words , of course , transmit feeling as well as thought . In his study of language , Ducasse ( like Dewey , with whom he often differed ) was influenced by Jespersen 's Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to this work , language did not originate in the endeavor to transmit thought or feeling . It was first used exclamatively as in the baby 's cry , not communicatively , forming an utterance from an inner craving of the individual , without thought of any fellow creature.47 Dewey denied the name " language " to such utterances ; they become language , he said , only in the context of mutual assistance , when communication occurs.48 For Ducasse , language is an intentional , external expression of an inner psychic state . Art , like the language of feeling , is essentially expression.49 Here , Ducasse cited  | Abercrombie 's remark that " the essence of artistic activity is communication " and juxtaposed the following quotation in rebuttal : " That transportation of certain acids can be effected only in stoneware carboys is a fact ; that stoneware is very convenient for this purpose is possible ; but it is nonetheless true that stoneware is not thus defined . " J0 Ducasse found that both Veron and Tolstoi used the term " expression " ambiguously . Tolstoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this respect . Ducasse said that Veron and Tolstoi were right , however , in conceiving art to be the language of feeling ; but he thought Tolstoi wrong in the idea that feeling can actually be transmitted from mind to mind . Veron was right in taking language to consist essentially in expression ; but he failed to qualify " expression " so as to exclude expressions of feeling that are not art.J1 Ducasse urged a cautious reading of Croce , who regarded art as essentially expression . When Croce spoke of " expression , " he meant the " spiritual aesthetic synthesis . " Ducasse felt that the Italian philosopher used the word " expression " irresponsibly in his studies of aesthetics . Thus , for Croce , beauty is the " hedonistic accompaniment " of expression . Aesthetic expression is necessarily expression in images . The physical work of art is nothing but a subsequent mechanical copy of the image that the artist has created and glimpsed in imagination . For Ducasse , Croce 's doctrine of the theoretical relation of " expression " to " intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two words when they are really one ? Croce is also in error , Ducasse insisted , in his views on the nature of the physical work of art . Illumination comes not in the act of creative expression but only in the subsequent contemplation of its product.52 Helen Huss Parkhurst ( 1887 ? 1959 ) Without contradicting other theories on the objectification of inner states in outward expression , Parkhurst suggested that " art is the natural and necessary precipitate of the wild sea of conflicting yet  | intricately related elements of which man 's consciousness is composed . " Her descriptions of man 's inner divisiveness and its resolution in art expressed the unifying vision of her aesthetic : If man were not thus divided against himself he could experience not half so deeply the urge to artistic expression . . . . Such art as he fashions is the natural and necessary precipitate of the wild sea of conflicting yet intricately related elements of which his consciousness is composed.53 Parkhurst thus found a relationship between creativity and the emotional conflicts of human existence . She suggested that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience to which the work of art corresponds , but from passionate excitement about the subject-matter " ? that is , from emotion . Noting that the emotions instigate creativity , she recalled Santayana 's view that emotion " is primarily about nothing and much of it remains about nothing to the end . . . objectless emotion chokes the heart with its dull importunity ; now it impedes right action , now it feeds and fattens illusion . " 54 Because emotion seeks a unifying objective , it may in some cases create its own illusory goals , as in many romantic and mystical works.55 In other cases it may create great art . To illustrate her unifying approach , Parkhurst mentioned Guyau 's memorable defense of the high emotional values of the combined experience of temperature and taste as shown by a man drinking a glass of milk on a mountain top after a hot and difficult climb . She added : This case might seem to be an ambiguous one . For presently he was at the same time feeling upon his skin the cold winds of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful panorama of country below him ; and possibly receiving a rich complex of sensations : sound and lights and sweetness replete with poetic associations . . . . Sensations seldom if ever come singly , and perhaps the capacity of a sensory quality to attract to itself the meaning of a number of scattered perceptions , thus producing an effect of emotional unity , is just the needed proof of its aesthetic significance.56  | This concept of the aesthetic significance of unity was the foundation of Parkhurst 's aesthetic theory . On the separability of substance and form , Parkhurst wondered whether the meaning of a work of art is not really resident in the human spirit itself rather than in the objective elements of the work . She quoted Santayana : Beauty can not be preserved mummified in any external object . . . . The only Venus which is inalienably beautiful is the divine essence revealed to the lover as he gazes , perhaps never to be revealed to another man , nor revealed to himself again.57 For Parkhurst , aesthetic form in poetry is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes a form of irregularity . The poignancy of poetry is secured by the contrasts and oppositions.J8 She accounted for the difference in ideal length between a symphony and a poem by suggesting that " the unity of effect in a poem is strictly dependent upon the maintenance of a single mood , while unity in music is compatible with a crowded procession of moods . " 50 Poetry and prose , said Parkhurst , differ only in degree , especially in blank verse.00 She concluded that the difference between prose and poetry is the difference between the speaking voice and the singing ? qualitatively distinct , yet incapable of exact description . She went on to say : There are passages . . . for which the inner silent voice of the reader is undeniably lifted ? changed from the soberer quality of plain speech into the voice of singing ? with the keen wail of pain , the quickened breathing of terror , the throaty utterance of passion , the moan of desolation , or the breathless cry of sheer ecstasy.61 Parkhurst suggested , however , that the rhythms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of verse , and she observed : " In poetry and prose alike , the purely formal aspect of audible rhythm  | with its blend of the expected and the unexpected constitutes their common participation in the quality of music . " 62 Prose , she noted further , is not entirely free of an appeal to emotion , as in Lincoln 's speeches and Schopenhauer 's essays . Thus , as Fred Newton Scott has suggested , no content is the exclusive property of poets.63 Indeed , in the unity that is literature , the varied arts of poetry and prose have much in common . Discussing the unifying effect of metaphor , Parkhurst noted that through it we may witness the impinging of the spatiality of colours upon the spacelessness of odours ; the assimilation of the corporeality of solid shape to the incorporeality of sound ; the merging of the nonsensuous into the sensuous richness of the palpable and the visible ; the transition from the warm immediacy and concreteness of the world of sense to the clear cold air of pure intellection.64 Another unifying element in literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme : The exceeding beauty that we discover in the vanishing qualities of the world is , beyond question , intensified by our perception of its omen of our own brief futility . . . . It is quite impossible to tell how seriously impaired might be our appreciation of what now seems to us an infinitely haunting melody , an ecstatic lyric , or a solemn building or carving , if the conflict between craving for permanence and unceasing subjection to the unenduring were removed altogether from our experience:65 Turning from thematic to technical unity in the play and the novel , Parkhurst pointed out that Ibsen was scrupulous in observing the Aristotelian unities of time , place , and action , which , however , restricted his choice of plots . She noted that , in art , extraneous detail must always be avoided . The goal of the artist is cohesiveness in the absorption of the arhythmic with the rhythmic , of detail in a totality of organization.66  | Thus , for Parkhurst , all art partakes of the unifying quality of metaphor : " The conceiving of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reduces to the contriving of effects describable in no better terms than those of metaphor ? that strange alchemy by which the essence of one order is blended with the essence of another . " 67 For Parkhurst , as for the other writers discussed in this chapter , aesthetics is indeed a unifying vision .  | ART AND EXPERIENCE : JOHN DEWEY ( 1859-1952 ) Dewey set the tone of his experiential approach to aesthetics in his early article " The New Psychology " ( 1884 ) . Here he criticized the old psychologists , who pruned experience " till it presented a trimmed tameness which would shock none of their laws " and " preyed upon its vitality till it would go into the coffin of their abstractions . " The new psychology believed " that truth , that reality , not necessary beliefs about reality , is given in the living experience of the soul 's development . " 1 THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE The essence of the aesthetic experience was described in the section " Aesthetic Feeling " in Dewey 's first book , Psychology ( 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , is harmony , or variety in unity . It is " the feeling of the agreement of some experience with the ideal nature of the self . " Related to harmony are the ideas of adaptation and economy , which occur when the means in an aesthetic experience are accurately fitted to the end .  | Feeling and Art For Dewey , feeling was something more than passive enjoyment of beauty ; it was the impetus , or spring , to creative activity in the form of the fine arts : " As the intellectual feelings , as springs to action , take the form of wonder , so the aesthetic feelings take the form of admiration . Admiration is love of beauty , as wonder is love of knowledge . " 3 The fine arts , then , which include poetry in its various forms , are attempts to satisfy the fundamental emotional impulses of mankind . In the development of these art forms , therefore , mere formulas should not , said Dewey , replace the living reality of experience based on feeling : Every attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . it stifles the efforts of the individual , and substitutes for . . . spontaneous freedom of action which is the essence of aesthetic production a rigid obedience to externally imposed rules . . . . It fossilizes the ideal into cut-and-dried formulae . . . and becomes a burdensome command to produce nothing new.4 In Experience and Nature ( 1926 ) Dewey elaborated this view . For him , " intellectual piety toward experience " was a precondition for freedom . Consciousness itself , when not dull and torpid , is a product of the imagination : Cosmogonies are mythological , not because savages indulge in defective scientific explanations , but because objects of imagination are consummatory in the degree in which they exuberantly escape from the pressure of natural surroundings . ... The congenial is the first form of the consistent.5 Delight in free experience results from " the esthetic character of logical coherence rather than its tested coherence with fact . " 6 Thus , for Dewey , every genuine work of art transforms man 's  | vision of himself and of his relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criticism of life in the highest sense : " For art fixes those standards of enjoyment and appreciation with which other things are compared ; it selects the objects of future desires ; it stimulates effort . " In a community , art , more than anything else , determines the direction of ideas and supplies the meanings in terms of which life is esteemed and criticized . ' Through art man overcomes the apparent hostility of nature , which Josiah Royce described when he observed : " The spirit is dissatisfied with the mathematical order and feels unfriendliness among the eternities. " 8 As opposed to these external threats , the inner experience of beauty becomes a constant adventure in readjustment that renews and refreshes the vision . The Inner Life The escape into one 's inner life as a road to freedom was not original with modern man . Savages , the oppressed , and children took that path , said Dewey , " long before it was formulated in philosophical romanticism . " The conscious awareness of this need , however , added a new dimension to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as new theories of aesthetics , as Dewey showed in his discussion of Santayana : Mr. Santayana is a thinker whose intent and basis are at one with classical thought . But if we note the importance assumed in his thinking by the " inward landscape , " there is before us a measure of the pervasive influence of the kind of experience that was seized upon by Romanticism as the exclusive truth of experience . " 9 In this passage , Dewey warned against an excessively individualistic approach to experience : Romanticism has made the best and the worst of the discovery of the private and uncommunicable .... It has created  | a vast and somnambulic egotism out of the fact of subjectivity . For every existence in addition to its qualitative and intrinsic boundaries has affinities and active outreachings for connection and intimate union . It is an energy of attraction , expansion and supplementation . . . . Sociability , communication are just as immediate traits of the concrete individual as the privacy of the closet of consciousness . A dualism ensues from the ambiguous nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being.10 Both elements of man 's nature motivate his creation of art through " the tang of overt conflict and the impact of harsh conditions . " In the process of creation , the self overcomes " external necessities by incorporating them in an individual vision and expression . " I1 The duality inherent in the creation of art leads inevitably , said Dewey , to the strife between classic and romantic . Classicism represents embodied objective order ; romanticism , the freshness and spontaneity that arise from individuality . Romantic art is marked by desire for the strange and the unusual , the exotic ; it attempts to incorporate the strange into the ordinary , as Carlyle suggested : " In art the infinite is made to blend with the finite ; to stand visible and as it were attainable there . " 12 Even the " classic , " when it was first produced , bore the marks of adventure and experiment : This fact is ignored by classicists in their protest against romantics who undertake the development of new values , often without possessing means for their creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of adventure , not because of its absence . The one who perceives and enjoys esthetically always has the sense of adventure in reading any classic that Keats had in reading Chapman 's " Homer . " 13 Dewey , moreover , found a similarity between the venturesomeness of the poet 's imagination and the experimental quest of the scientist or philosopher . Poets and scientists alike are " full of many wonders of the spheres . " Thus , Dewey concluded , inclusiveness is the mark of the true aesthetic experience :  | Not absence of desire and thought but their thorough incorporation into perceptual experience characterizes esthetic experience , in its distinction from experiences that are especially " intellectual " and " practical . " He points to the experience of reading Keats 's " The Eve of Saint Agnes , " in which thought is active but not apart from other elements . The experience is marked " by a greater inclusiveness of all psychological factors than occurs in ordinary experiences . . . . How can experience that is rich as well as unified be reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art For Dewey , contemplation was " a name for the perception of significant characters , plus an emphatic allusion to an accompanying esthetic emotion . " 15 What part did this emotion play in the development of knowledge ? Modem psychology certainly recognized the emotional aura that accompanies all knowing , although the mere enjoyment of an idea does not in itself validate the idea as verifiable knowledge . If , with the Greeks , we regard knowledge as contemplation rather than as a productive art , then art will be secondary to the aesthetic , " creation " will be secondary to " taste , " and the scientist will assume a lower rank than the dilettante . " But , " said Dewey , , . . if modern tendencies are justified in putting art and creation first . . . it would then be seen that science is an art , that art is practice , and that the only distinction worth drawing is not between practice and theory , but between those modes of practice that are not intelligent , not inherently and immediately enjoyable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once this is seen , there " would disappear the separations that trouble present thinking : division of everything into nature and experience , of experience into practice and theory , art and science , ? useful art and fine , menial and free . " Here again aesthetics appears  | as a unifying vision , eliminating , among other dualities , the age-old imagined conflict between art and science.16 Art , as an active productive process , was defined by Dewey as a combination of two perceptions , the aesthetic and the operative : " In complete art , appreciation follows the object and moves with it to its completion . . . . Art , free from subjection to any ism , ' has movement , creation , as well as order , finality . " 17 Those who would make art wholly esoteric are therefore confronted by Dewey with two alternatives : either art is a continuation of natural tendencies , or it is a peculiar addition to the nature of something springing exclusively from within man . If it is a continuation of natural tendencies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any object that is consummatory that is , completed with an end in view . It is the outcome of a skilled and intelligent art of dealing with natural things for the sake of intensifying , purifying , prolonging and deepening the satisfactions which they spontaneously afford . " If art is a peculiar addition , it has an occult , esoteric character ; and those critics who adhere to this isolation of art hold that it is the expression of the emotions and that " subject-matter is of no significance except as material through which emotion is expressed . " For them , true art is the " reduction of subject-matter to a mere medium of emotion ! " Dewey argued , however , that emotion is a response to an objective situation and indicates a more or less excited participation in some scene of nature or life . The art process is a spontaneous emotional response to a situation occurring without any reference to art , " and without esthetic ' quality save in the sense in which all immediate enjoyment and suffering is esthetic. " 19 Dewey maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of emphasis , purity , and subtlety . An artist may select forms discriminatingly or by " a kind of sympathetic vibration . " Some contemporary art , Dewey believed , was at its worst , " scientific " rather than artistic and represented " technical exercises , sterile and of a new kind of pedantry . " At its best , it assisted " in ushering in new modes of art by education of the organ of perception in new modes of consummatory objects ; they enlarge and enrich the world of human vision . " 20  | THE CONTINUITY OF EXPERIENCE In Art as Experience ( 1934 ) , Dewey insisted that it is the task of the philosopher of the fine arts " to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events , doings , and sufferings that are universally recognized to constitute experience . " 21 He defined experience as " the result , the sign , and the reward of that interaction of organism and environment which , when it is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation and communication . " Any oppositions of mind and body in this participation are " marks of contraction and withdrawal . " Thus , " art is . . . prefigured in the very processes of living . " Intellectual experience can not be sharply marked off from the aesthetic . Intellectual experience , if it is to be complete , must include aesthetic elements . Thus the intellectual experience itself " has a satisfying emotional quality because it possesses internal integration and fulfillment reached through ordered and organized movement . " 22 Dewey asserted , moreover , that the thought of the artist is as profound as that of the scientific inquirer : To think effectively in terms of relations of qualities is as severe a demand upon thought as to think in terms of symbols , verbal and.mathematical . Indeed , since words are easily manipulated in mechanical ways , the production of a work of genuine art probably demands more intelligence than does most of the so-called thinking that goes on among those who pride themselves on being intellectuals . Clearly , then , " the esthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of idle luxury or transcendental ideality ? it is the clarified and intensified development of traits that belong to every normally complete experience . " 2a  | On Creativity The process of creativity involves expression , which arises from inner agitation and impulsion . In this process , said Dewey , the poet and the novelist have an immense advantage over an expert psychologist in dealing with emotions . Instead of describing the sensation in intellectual and symbolic terms , " the artist does the deed that breeds ' the emotion . . . . In the development of an expressive act , the emotion operates like a magnet drawing to itself appropriate material . " This turmoil , if it is to produce more than mere exclamation , must be shaped and embodied in an artistic form . Even lyrical expression , which appears to be unpremeditated , is controlled material . Thus spontaneity , Dewey said , is actually the result of long periods of activity , or else it is so empty as not to be an act of expression at all.24 Here Dewey was clearly influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experience : A man 's conscious wit and will are aiming at something only dimly and inaccurately imagined . Yet all the while the forces of mere organic ripening within him are going on to their own prefigured result , and his conscious strainings are letting loose subconscious allies behind the scenes which in their way work toward rearrangement , and the rearrangement toward which all these deeper forces tend is pretty surely definite , and definitely different from what he consciously conceives and determines.25 This , Dewey commented , is true not only of artists but of scientists who " do not operate by conscious wit and will to anything like the extent popularly supposed . " Both scientists and artists engage in " emotionalized thinking . " Artists ... have for their subject-matter the qualities of things of direct experience ; " intellectual " inquirers deal with these qualities at one remove , through the medium of symbols that stand for qualities but are not significant to their immediate presence . The ultimate difference is enormous as far as the technique of  | thought and emotion are concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionalized ideas and subconscious maturing are concerned.26 Artistic Form Having emphasized the importance of formal elements as controlling factors in creativity , Dewey rejected the concept of the separation of substance and form . Such a dichotomy , he said , serves only to divide " the live creature " from its environment . Indeed , he notes that form in one context is substance in another or even in the same work of art.27 Rhythm , an aspect of form in art , derives from the very relationship of man to nature : The participation of man in nature 's rhythms , a partnership much more intimate than is any observation of them for purposes of knowledge , induced him to impose rhythm in changes where they did not appear . The apportioned reed , the stretched string and taut skin rendered the measures of action conscious through song and dance . . . . The formative arts that shaped things of use were wedded to the rhythms of voice and the self-contained movements of the body , and out of the union technical arts gained the quality of fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce evident order into some phase of the confused observations and images of mankind . Man no longer conformed his activities of necessity to the rhythmic changes of nature 's cycles , but used those which necessity forced upon him to celebrate his relations to nature as if she had conferred upon him the freedom of her realm.28 Rhythm , a universal element of existence , underlies all the arts . It arises from a resistance to the immediate expression of emotion , creating a tension that in turn produces periodic accumulation and release : Esthetic recurrence . . . is vital , physiological , functional . . . . Each recurrence is novel as well as a reminder . In satisfying  | an aroused expectancy , it also institutes a new longing , incites a fresh curiosity , establishes a changed suspense . This process of recurrence is the mainspring of artistic and scientific creativity . It is the source of energy that leads to discovery and testing , proof and exploration , closure and awakening.29 As a unifying force , emotional energy " evokes , assembles , accepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works them into a whole toned throughout by the same emotional feeling . Thereby is presented an object that is unified and distinguished throughout . " In this connection , Dewey supported his own ideas by quoting Santayana : Perceptions do not remain in the mind , as would be suggested by the trite simile of the seal and the wax , passive and changeless , until time wears off their rough edges and makes them fade . No , perceptions fall into the brain rather as seeds into a furrowed field or even as sparks into a keg of gunpowder . Each image breeds a hundred more , sometimes slowly and subterraneously , sometimes ( as when a passionate train is started ) with a sudden burst of fancy.3o In a further elaboration of the relationship between rhythm and creativity , Dewey cited Schiller 's description of the peculiar musical mood , or Stimmung , that precedes the creation of a poem . This mood is marked by a " penetrating quality , " which unifies discrete perceptions into an organic whole , leaving , however , an aura of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vague and therefore spiritual effect . " 31 In verse , said Dewey , meter acts as a rhythmic expression of emotional energy to produce a unified sensation or mood . Again , the immediate expression of emotion encounters resistance , resulting in the development of rhythmic form . On this point , Dewey cited Coleridge , who traced the origin of meter " to the balance in the mind effected by that spontaneous effort which strives to hold in check the workings of passion . " Dewey added Coleridge 's remark that every  | work of art must have about it something not understood to obtain its full effect 32 The Nature of Criticism Dewey 's ideas on creativity and form provided the basis of his approach to criticism . Like Spingarn , he believed that the critic must share the experience of the artist : We lay hold of the full import of a work of art only as we go through in our own vital processes the processes the artist went through in producing the work . It is the critic 's privilege to share in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he so often arrests it.33 Thus equipped , the critic will be able to carry on his most important function ? expanding the experience of the observer of art . The absence of such an approach to criticism led , Dewey believed , to the oversimplification that often reduced the whole work of art to one isolated element , as in much psychoanalytic criticism . Another fallacy was the failure to recognize that art has its own ideas ? that the artist does not simply use preexisting " acceptable " material , which he renders palatable by emotional or imaginative coloration.34 Both failures resulted from a critical failure of empathy in regard to the unique experience of the artist . Dewey 's holistic approach to experience , which emphasized the complexity of the whole over the mere sum of the parts , led him to side with Wordsworth on the relationship of science and art : If the labours of men of science should ever create any material revolution , direct or indirect , in our condition and in the impressions which we habitually receive , the Poet will sleep then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at their side , carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of science itself . Dewey added : " But poetry will not on that account be a popularization of science , nor will its characteristic values be those of science . " 35  | Although Dewey 's remark indicated a certain continuing belief in the duality of science and art , he asserted that both depend on the imagination for their creativity and that both may contribute to an expansion of human experience : The arts of science note the phrase , of politics , of history , and of painting and poetry all have finally the same material : that which is constituted by the interaction of the live creature with his surroundings . They differ in the media by which they convey and express this material , not in the material itself . He to the purpose of control and prediction , of increase of power ; it is an art . Under particular conditions , its matter may also be esthetic . " " THE QUALITY OF LIFE Dewey 's approach to literary criticism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its particular relation to experience : " Art is the quality that permeates an experience ; it is not , save by a figure of speech , the experience itself . " In the process of reorganizing past experience in the light of present knowledge , the artist attempts to effect an imaginative union of past and present , 37 seeking thereby to heighten the quality of experience . In this process , " the sense of relation between nature and man in some form has always been the actuating spirit of art . " 38 Art thus becomes a re-creative force derived from works of the imagination through conflict and resistance : " Friction is as necessary to generate esthetic energy as it is to supply the energy that drives machinery . " The widening of experience through imaginative recreation would lead , Dewey suggested , to increasingly meaningful leisure time and to the enrichment of the quality of life in society as a whole.39  | Dewey and the Romantics With his expansive philosophy of art , Dewey recalls the Romantic poets , whose ideas on the expansion of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Poetry . . . is at once the center and circumference of all knowledge ; it is that which comprehends all science and to which all science must be referred . . . . Poetry awakens and enlarges the mind by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought . Following this view , Dewey observed that in both the production and enjoyment of works of art , knowledge is transformed : " it becomes something more than knowledge because it is merged with intellectual elements from an experience worth while as an experience . " 40 He also noted with approval Shelley 's remark on the imagination as " the great instrument of moral good , " which makes possible the expansion of experience and " the identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought , action , or person , not our own . " 4r Similarly suggestive views in the works of Keats particularly impressed Dewey , as when Keats observed that the artist may look " pon the Sun , the Moon , the Stars , and the Earth and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethereal things ? greater things than the Creator himself made . " Dewey used the phrase " ethereal things " as the title of a chapter in Art and Experience " to designate the meanings and values that many philosophers and some critics suppose are inaccessible to sense , because of their spiritual , eternal , and universal characters ? thus exemplifying the common dualism of nature and spirit . " Keats 's identification of the artist 's attitude with the live creature was especially important for Dewey . Both man and the hawk , said Keats , engage in movements toward a goal : " There may be reasonings , but when they take an instinctive form , like that of animal  | forms and movements , they are poetry , they are fine ; they have grace . " 42 According to Dewey , " reasonings " have an origin like that of the movements of a wild creature toward its goal : " they may become spontaneous , instinctive , ' and when they become instinctive are sensuous and immediate , poetic . " Dewey noted further that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . as excluding imagination and sense , can reach truth . Even " the greatest philosopher " exercises an animal-like preference to guide his thinking to its conclusions . He selects and puts aside as his imaginative sentiments move . " Reason " at its height can not attain complete grasp and a self-contained assurance . It must fall back upon imagination ? upon the embodiment of ideas in emotionally charged sense.43 Here Keats and Dewey were clearly aligned in their views on the impact of experience . Dewey did not , of course , overlook the famous lines , " Beauty is truth ; truth beauty ? that is all/Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know " and , in conjunction with this , Keats 's prose statement , " What the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth . " Dewey suggested that " truth " as used by Keats denoted the wisdom by which men live ; it was independent of positive statement . The critical words were " on earth , " where men 's " irritable reaching after fact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Dewey 's view , the philosophy of Keats , like that of Shakespeare , entails an acceptance of life and experience in all its uncertainty , mystery and doubt , a wandering " in faery lands forlorn . " 44 The enrichment of experience made possible by such a philosophy was further suggested for Dewey by Keats 's observations on the nature of the poetic imagination : As to the poetical character itself . . . it is not itself . It is everything and nothing ? it enjoys light and shade : it lives in gusto , be it fair or foul , high or low , rich or poor , mean or elevated . . . . It does not harm from its relish for the dark side of things , any more than from its taste for the bright one .  | . . . A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence , because he has no identity ? he is continually in and for , and filling some other body.45 The ethical , and indeed the sociological implications of the free play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By every germ of spirit sucking the sap from mold etherial , every human being might become great , and Humanity instead of being a wide heath of furze and briars with here and there a remote Pine or Oak , would become a grand democracy of Forest Trees ! 46 From Wordsworth Dewey derived support for his idea that poetic art does not merely lead to but actually constitutes an experience , as in the poet 's vivid poetic expression of Tintern Abbey . After discussing the integration of form and matter in the poet 's work , Dewey pointed to Wordsworth 's own record of his " poetic history " and his " consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearance " ? his development from the conventional ( and its language ) to a more complete perceptiveness , to an experience that , as Dewey said , corresponded more subtly and sensitively to the rhythm of natural change ( and its language ) and to an ever-deepening enrichment of experience.47 Also relevant to Dewey 's philosophy was Coleridge 's term " esemplastic , " which Coleridge used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process as a " welding together of all elements , no matter how diverse in ordinary experience , into a new and completely unified experience . " Coleridge 's further distinction between imagination and fancy had little attraction for Dewey , who favored the poet 's definition of imagination in its synthesizing rather than in its analytic aspects.48 Shelley 's influence on Browning paralleled his influence on Dewey , as shown in Browning 's essay on Shelley . Browning noted that when the average person ( " the general eye " ) has absorbed all he can through his senses , the poet , with his loftier vision , will lift his fellows , " with their half-apprehensions , to his own sphere . " 49 Those  | who follow , however , will merely subsist on " food swallowed long ago by a supply of fresh and living swaths . " The world must then await the appearance of a new poet , who will get . .. at new substance by breaking up the assumed wholes into parts of independent and unclassed value , careless of the unknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yet another poet to suggest these hereafter ) , prodigal of objects for men 's outer and not inner sight , shaping for their uses a new and different creation from the last , which it displaces by the right of life over death . Thus , as Dewey observed , " Art has been the means of keeping alive the sense of purposes that outrun evidence and of meanings that transcend indurated habit . " J0 Santayana 's influence on Dewey 's ethical views was suggested by Dewey 's citation of the statement , " Value lies in meaning , not in substance : in the ideal which things approach , not in the energy which they embody " ( Dewey 's emphasis ) . J1 Dewey , however , refuted Santayana 's complaint that Shakespeare lacked a philosophical system , replying : An artist may be instinctively repelled by the constraint imposed by acceptance of any system . If the important thing is as Santayana said " not this or that system but some system , " why not accept , with Shakespeare , the free and varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful to the many potentialities of nature rather than to any fixed philosophy . It thus constituted a clear model for Dewey 's philosophy of experience . Qualitative Thought Further evidence of Dewey 's concern with the quality of life may be found in his essay " Qualitative Thought . " 53 Noting that " the world in which we immediately live . . . is pre-eminently a qualitative  | world , " he observed that science is concerned with relations , not with qualities . A persistent logical problem involves the relation between two types of propositions , one referring to objects of physical science and the other to qualitative objects . The terms " feeling " and " felt " are the names for a relation of quality . Feeling is the first stage in the development of explicit distinctions . Reflection and rational elaboration spring from and make explicit a prior intuition . Dewey thus favored Bergson 's contention that intuition precedes and penetrates more deeply than conception . Thought is the transformation of an intuition , which " signifies the realization of a pervasive quality such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ejaculatory judgments as " Good , " " Oh , " " Yes , " " No " supply perhaps the simplest example of qualitative thought in its purity : " Language fails not because thought fails , but because no verbal symbols can do justice to the fullness and richness of thought . " The logic of the artist is the logic of qualitative thinking : Without an independent qualitative apprehension , the characteristics of a work of art can be translated into explicit harmonies . . . only in a way which substitutes mechanical formulae for esthetic quality . The value of any such translation in esthetic criticism is measured , moreover , by the extent to which the propositional statements return to effect a heightening and deepening of a qualitative apprehension . Otherwise , esthetic appreciation is replaced by judgment of isolated technique . . . . Construction that is artistic is as much a case of genuine thought as that expressed in scientific and philosophical matters , and so is all genuine esthetic appreciation of art , since the latter must in some way , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AESTHETIC ANALYSIS AND THE PHILOSOPHIC DIMENSION OF CRITICISM David W. Prall ( 1886 ? 1940 ) Prall 's major work , Aesthetic Analysis ( 1936 ) , was clearly indebted to Dewey , especially in its emphasis on the qualitative presentation of the world . For Prall , consciousness was awareness of felt qualitative content . The movement from mere qualitative surface to active participation in discrimination of quality and the realization of the character of things constitutes the aesthetic aspect of experience . No experience is totally aesthetic or , for that matter , totally anaesthetic . Like Dewey , Prall believed that men are all self-preserving nodes in the intrinsic and infinite matrix of natural flux . They experience the aesthetic the moment they are not totally anaesthetized . ) Prall also shared Dewey 's belief that the aesthetic is differentiated by the same elements that mark off a particular experience from experience in general . The concrete object of aesthetic perception , said Prall , is the determinate and emotionally intuited content . In an aesthetic experience , the observer finds the world presented immediately through his senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organism in a response involving emotional tone . Thus , for Prall , aesthetics is neither physics , nor psychology , nor physiology . It is not process at all : it is color and sound , not physical wave motions ; it is attracting , exciting quality ; deep rich color , moving , emotional sound , not nerve currents or accelerated breathing or pulse.2 if qualities have relations , then qualitative wholes may be amenable to scientific treatment , which deals with relations and abstract structures.3 The concrete apprehension of an aesthetic object is in its very nature feeling . This feeling , however , is aesthetic only if it is directed exclusively to the object , not to some irrelevance suggested by some incidental aspect of it . Contemplation that does not attend and discriminate is either not aesthetic contemplation at all , or it is the aesthetic contemplation of something else ? bodily states instead of the presented object . Aesthetic analysis is not itself aesthetic appreciation . Aesthetics is a branch of knowledge ; it is knowledge of qualities in their immediacy and their immediately grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not teach men how to write poetry ( or , I might add , how to make bread ) , it may teach them something about the nature of their enjoyment of it.5 The aesthetic is the element that is present in the medium apprehended . It depends , of course , on immediate experience , not simply on vague awareness. ? All works of art are concretely experienced presentations of sensoryimaginal content . In poetry , for instance , language expresses feeling or emotion as the qualitative character of imagined content . Feeling simply is concrete direct experience . The sensuous presentations of art directly embody feeling . Qualitative terms are simply the names for the way things feel . Feelings thus consist of sensuously qualified content. ? An aesthetic object that is at all absorbing presents complexity that must yet be sufficiently simple to be apprehended as a qualitative unity . Technical aesthetic perception helps to apprehend qualitative character and to discriminate the technical and aesthetic constituents of the effect . Following Dewey , Prall said that , with the aim of art  | being expression , art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication. $ Analysis accomplishes its purpose in aesthetics only when all that it describes as elements and patterns are seen to be integrated in the affective quality or feeling that is the unitary aesthetic character of the given work of art analyzed . The adequate critic , Prall believed , needs full acquaintance with the traditional technical material as well as with all the historically developed aesthetic forms and instrumentalities . He also needs flexibility to enable him to go beyond the object immediately before him.9 Prall considered the qualitative element in both art and science . In art , the qualitative has taken a marked intrinsic significance for human beings . According to him , it is also the starting point in science ; logic itself begins in qualitative distinctions . The final goal of natural science , however , is not acquaintance with qualities and their directly felt relations and structures , but with the conditions of their occurrence , their dynamic relations , and the control of the processes that involve them . In aesthetics , on the other hand , one seeks a direct acquaintance with content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general acquaintance makes possible a full grasp of the character of particular works of art as well as of the aesthetic aspects of nature.10 Aesthetics itself is theory , not appreciative aesthetic experience . Aesthetics has not reached the point where a fully adequate analysis of a whole concrete experience can be made out , partly because it has not been seriously cultivated and also partly because such an analysis would involve all the findings of all the sciences ? a complete knowledge of the organic conditions of the response and a complete knowledge of all that may be the subject of a response , whether inside or outside the organism . Given these limits of aesthetic analysis , it is completely valid as scientific knowledge . ' Aesthetics is primarily a theory of the nature of the arts , the total subject matter of which is the qualitative nature of things directly presented through sensory-affective organic functioning . Men demand structure composed of discriminable constituents in apprehended  | relations . The qualitative sensory-affective surface of the world generates interest and this , in one way or another , amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely representative . Even strictly aesthetic analysis can not avoid the technical aspects of the arts.12 Prall said relatively little about literary aesthetics . He mentioned pitch variation in both music and verse , and showed that rhythm is not divorced from sense . The meaning of words , he said , is to be found only in concrete , nonverbal content . Thus an indirect symbolic medium like language may function aesthetically in two ways : ( 1 ) Words may be not heard but heard through , presenting not themselves but their meanings . When language provides content by such transparent functioning , this content is not verbal at all , but fully imaginal and emotional , as suggested by Sapir 's remark : " Gentlemen , words are only words . " ( 2 ) Words may be so placed and so integrated in specific contexts that a reader finds them in rhythm and skillful connotation ? which again is not verbal but imaginal . Words thus used suggest feelings that do not arise from the meanings of separate words , phrases , and sentences , but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of words , the total meaning determined both by perceived sounds and by presented imaginal content.13 Stephen Coburn Pepper ( 1891 ? ) Pepper , in his Aesthetic Quality : A Contextualistic Theory of Beauty ( 1937 ) , " expressed his indebtedness to William James , Prall , and Dewey , among others.15 He maintained that " the full justification of an aesthetic theory extends far beyond the bounds of the aesthetic field .... It depends . . . on a philosophy . " Citing the work of I. A. Richards as a good example of the eclectic method , Pepper remarked that , like a book of proverbs , it was full of wisdom , but also of halftruths , and consequently of half-falsehoods , and of implicit and even explicit contradictions . It lacked , in an eminent degree , objectivity . Pepper charged that all the mechanistic features arbitrarily selected by Richards can be found implicitly , if not explicitly , in Santayana 's  | The Sense of Beauty . The idealistic features in Bernard Bosanquet 's Three Lectures in Aesthetics and the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along by a sort of momentum into the universe of facts with which they deal . This , said Pepper , can not be said of Richards 's book . " Although Pepper was committed to a contextualistic interpretation , he did not believe that it represented " the only justifiable or profitable point of view . " He stated outright : " I have no desire to make the contextualistic theory appear to conquer all others . . . for a submergence of the other good theories would be very unhealthy both in theory and in criticism . " Furthermore , two theories equally good may compensate for each other 's possible omissions or distortions.17 The objectivity of science , said Pepper , is disintegration ; that of fine art , integration . Science seeks to control its results by a maximum elimination of outlying effects , while fine art seeks to control its results by a maximum encompassing of outlying effects : Fine art conscripts elements to function in the mutual determination of one another , having no faith in the self-determination of an element . For there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a single visual line , a single color , a single word . But place any of these in a skillfully framed context and its character becomes as specific as anything in the world italics added.18 Here , then , is the central idea of contextualism . For Pepper , the aesthetic encompasses the quality of events . The quality can be understood only through intuition , so that aesthetics depends on intuited qualities . Intuition is centripetal . The aesthetic experience , arising from the vivid sense of the quality of an event , is no mere emotional superfluity or cosmic luxury . On the contrary , Pepper insisted , it is the most illuminating of activities . It gives a direct insight into the nature of the world and the substance of reality ? it realizes events : " To feel the quality of an event is to feel the actual working part of the world process italics added . . . . It is to stop swimming and rest upon a wave , and feel the cosmic currents , and the movement of the world swell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water .  | Pepper continued : Art is thus fully as cognitive , fully as knowing as science , so that contextualists are fond of calling the intuition of quality a realization . If scientific , analytical knowledge has scope , it nevertheless lacks intimacy and realization . The artist like the scientist is a man whose function it is to lead to a better knowledge of nature ? not , however , by showing us how to control her , but how to realize her.19 Pepper was reminiscent of Bergson when he said that a given event is a section of continuous duration or temporal flow , even though the very act of naming it seems to stop it and freeze it . Quality is continually changing . A line is a process , as is an area of color , or a combination of a line and color . Pepper called processes strands and described a set of interrelated strands as a texture . A strand is a single discriminated process ; a texture is a connected pattern of strands . But a strand may reveal itself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands . Similarly , a texture may assume the function of a strand in a still larger texture . The analysis of a texture is , accordingly , the singling out and the following out of its strands , while the intuition of a texture is the realization of its fused quality.20 Thus , for Pepper , analysis and intuition were interrelated . No texture exists in isolation ; it has connections through its strands in all directions . Some of these connections are essential to a full understanding of its analytical nature . These connections , said Pepper , are mainly inferential and not discoverable by direct discrimination of the details of a given event.21 Pepper asserted that the perceived character of a work of art is just as much a revelation of oneself as it is of the work . In this sense , all qualities are relative , as is all aesthetic experience . The qualities represent a cooperative result of an interaction between a personal and an impersonal continuous texture . An individual work of art is a progressive coupling of many single perceptions.22 Pepper described a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one aesthetic quality or experience . He cited two important types of relationship quality : one discloses similarity ;  | the other , individuality . Similarity consists in two or more textures having strands that converge , or that tend to converge , on another texture or on a strand of another texture , which is said to be common to the first two textures . Similarity spreads a thin quality wide ; if belabored , it tends rather quickly to reduce the qualitativeness of events . Its use is consequently mainly analytical , and it enters the aesthetic field only in a somewhat subsidiary way.23 The relationship quality of individuality represents the central principle of massive aesthetic experience . It involves the sense that cables of strands carry over from one event into another and even when spread apart can be reassembled and spun again . This carryover is made possible by the continuity and flow of events . The underlying ground for relationship quality is clearly the continuous physical textures of the body.24 The event quality of each successive perception becomes gradually enriched in a process called funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enrichment.2 " Thus quality is the immediate intuited aspect of an event . The aesthetic field is that of intuited quality . Beauty is enhanced quality.26 Analysis , however , seems to drain events of quality : " A moment 's thought is passion 's passing bell . " 27 Believing that in essence Croce 's theory calls for the elimination of conflict , analysis , and regularity , Pepper reacted against it because he held that the greatest enhancement of quality is not obtained this way . Paradoxically , it is obtained through the incorporation in art of activities hostile to quality.28 In aesthetic practice , the three deadening activities ? analysis , conflict , regularity ? reduce to two ? conflict and organization ? because regularity is by and large the method of organization , and analysis consists of simply rendering explicit the elements of the method . Both conflict and organization , if properly controlled , contribute directly to the increase of quality , the one by vivifying the quality of occurrence , the other by extending it . These two ways of increasing beauty are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce extent , and extension tends to reduce intensity . The artist must find that nice adjustment between these opposing tendencies which produces the maximum of quality with the available materials.29  | Two factors lead to the intensification of quality : novelty and conflict . Novelty is the tearing off of habit.3 ? Men who have grown old and stiff in habits have to fabricate materials that children find everywhere with no effort . Pepper believed that everyone could confirm in his own memory Wordsworth 's recollections : There was a time when meadow , grove and stream , The earth and every common sight to me did seem Apparell 'd in celestial light , The glory and the freshness of a dream ... . But yet I know , where'er I go , That there hath passed away the glory from the earth.31 Pepper also quoted a passage from Romain Rolland 's Jean Christophe in which Jean is fascinated by the variety and menacing quality of clouds . In another long passage the child steals up to the piano and is lost in the mystery of the sounds emitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play , analysis begins to steal away the spirits , making them familiar and indifferent.32 A word is a very paradigm of habit . The principle of intrusive novelty is particularly evident in words . Such novelty acts as a scintillating light that plays over the surface of life and art . Although it produces no deep beauty , it gently reminds men of the qualities of things . It is the best substitute for the fresh experiences of childhood 33 Conflict , said Pepper , is an extreme case of intrusive novelty . In conflict , the artist is quick to perceive an agent of great aesthetic value . Like fire , it must be confined and induced to warm its maker , not left free to consume him . The greatest art , with few exceptions , is composed of this inflammable and flaming material . The more violent and extensive the conflict , provided it can be controlled , the greater the potentiality of quality . ' " The inflammable potentialities of a purpose , the extent and intensity of quality that it can produce , depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength of the obstacles placed in its path , partly on the capacity of the organism to master its faculties for the problem . Hunger , love , jealousy , fear , hate , and ambition are powerful drives . The ideal aesthetic material seems to be a rich , resourceful ,  | and strong personality stirred by a powerful drive to some end and confronted by formidable obstacles to its attainment.35 Every art is susceptible to emotion , which is the very spirit of dramatic conflict . Such emotion is most easily exhibited in the novel and the drama . In architecture ( which Goethe called " frozen music " ) , the drama occurs among lines , surfaces , and volumes . The architect extends his conflicts through space instead of through time.36 Emotion , Pepper admitted , is the most intimately felt and the least satisfactorily understood of all objects of experience . It baffles analysis and yet influences our lives . The paradox disappears when one considers that emotion is the very essence of quality . It is a relative term ; its correlate is analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Swiftly walk o'er the western wave , /Spirit of Night " would be an emotion . A concentration of quality , with no great massiveness of intensity , constitutes a sensuous feeling , as in an observer 's absorption in the violet of a night sky . The spell of a soft evening ? saturating thought , movement , and utterance ? would be a mood . Feeling and mood may become emotion when an accumulation of intensity and extensity occurs . All these elements differ only in degree . Thus Pepper accepted James 's theory of the emotions , enlarging it to include not only bodily sensations but all feelings , and insisting explicitly on the fusion of all sensations.37 Emotion , arising from conflict , may be presented in art in three often intermingled ways : direct stimulation , representation , and expression . Given this variety , the wise artist will not disparage emotion as a false element or as mere sentimentality . Indeed , the normal aesthetic experience represents a balance between emotional fusion and analytic discrimination.38 The very concept of good taste forms a middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the critic.30 On this point Pepper again agreed with James , that if one lacks the capacity for " seizure " and ecstasy in a work of art , then one has also lost the power for full realization.40 Pepper stated further that quality is the life of art and organization its body . Conflict and analysis can depict an event of quality , and both can be used to intensify and increase quality , by giving it  | spread and depth . Conflict and analysis , however , are intrinsically antagonistic . Pepper 's aesthetic therefore presented three paradoxes : ( I ) conflict as a source of frustration and even destruction of quality and , at the same time , as a source of the intensification of quality ; ( 2 ) analysis ? which forms the internal structure of organization ? with its ability to drain an event of quality , but also with the capability to increase quality , not by enhancing its vividness but by giving it spread and depth ; ( 3 ) the antagonism of conflict and analysis and their common antagonism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization is nearly synonymous with harmony . Yet the organization wanted in art is one that produces harmony without dissolving conflict . Thus quality , not analysis , is the essence of beauty.4 ' The bulk of aesthetic criticism , Pepper suggested , is directly or indirectly concerned with types . In general , he pointed out , a type is a system of strands that fully ( or almost fully ) appears in an individual object and is repeatable in other individual objects . This characteristic of full appearance in an individual object constitutes the intrinsic character of a type . The concept of a system implies that the references of the strands constituting the type mutually involve each other and do not vary widely . A sense of system arises from a mutuality of reference among the strands of a texture , as in the Petrarchan sonnet . Such a sonnet must be strictly followed in its principal features or the reader is jarred into intellectual analysis and a consequent diminution of quality . A properly constituted type , therefore , is not merely an organizing tool ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Discriminating analysis reveals the quality , and the quality in turn is the revelation of the analysis.42 " Pattern " is an intrinsic mode of organization , as Pepper showed in his analysis of the Shakespearean line " Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ? " In this line the regular pattern is felt , but not said or heard . The rhythm of the verse is thus a simultaneous combination of two patterns : the skeletal and the axial.43 He said that no division exists between symmetry and balance , and he described the  | use of repetitive rhythms . In a poem , the reader first notices words and syllable sounds , gradually understanding the overall pattern of lines and stanzas ? stanzas in verse that are unrestricted in their repetitions . " A theme is any pattern composed of any sort of elements that is capable of recognizable repetition or variation . It must be strictly a pattern so that it can be grasped as a whole . Recognizability becomes the prime factor in the principle of theme and variation , which extends the limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it holds monotony longest at bay . The limit of a man 's ability to learn without fatigue is all that prevents theme and variation from representing virtually unlimited fruitfulness in design . A theme , however , can not be greater than a rather simple organization of elements.45 Because Pepper defined beauty as enhanced quality of texture , any texture of vivid quality was , for him , an object of beauty . The primary aesthetic judgment for Pepper 's theory was expressed in the statement , " This is a texture vivid in quality . " Without vividness of quality , the texture is not aesthetic . Thus Pepper 's hypothesis suggested that no ugliness exists but that degrees of beauty occur ? degrees of intensity of enhancement and degrees of extensity of texture . Throughout his work Pepper was guided by two standards of aesthetic excellence ? vividness of quality and spread of quality . To these he added a third standard ? depth . Individual textures acquire a depth and a solidity of character when they participate in social interests . The highest beauty , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality , ( 2 ) of great spread and ( 3 ) of depth . This threefold discrimination constituted Pepper 's basic aesthetic judgment . The texture of appreciation changes , however , with such factors as fatigue , irritability , or a change in the object . One must also consider such personal conditions as a receptive mood and adequate experience ( good taste ) . By the receptive mood Pepper meant a general readiness of the system of personal strands to splice themselves into the system of impersonal strands and generate the total organized texture to the full capacity of the spectator or the participant in a work of art.46  | The personal strands should be relevant to the impersonal strands and relevant to each other . Coleridge 's " imagination " is nothing other than the prolongation of the impersonal strands into the personal system and the enrichment produced by the personal strands in the generation of the total aesthetic work of art . Imagination , in short , is the personal contribution to the aesthetic work of art . Without the imagination , all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describable only in the analytical relational term of physics.47 Pepper described the operation of the imagination as follows : The physical work of art presents certain relations to be filled out by personal strands . First an act of perception occurs . The observer brings into the texture of his perception the relevant qualities of the schemes in which the physical relations participate . These factors constitute " funded interest . " The perception is enriched and deepened by these interests into an apperception , and the apperception spreads into image and idea . Meanwhile , during all this imaginative construction , intrusive novelties , dramatic conflicts , and emotions arise and saturate the texture with vitality . In this way , an aesthetic work of art is created out of a physical work of art . The physical continuity exists , however , only as a fragile system of schematic relations , the primary objective being the imaginatively constructed work.48 Because every experience is qualitatively unique , the aesthetic experiences of two spectators are necessarily different ; everyone has different modes of imagery . The images of a poem will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet poems rely greatly on images . In spite of such differences , no diminution of objectivity need occur in the specific realization of such a line as Keats 's " And gathering swallows twitter in the Skies . " The visual image occurs in the reference to the spatial location " in the skies " ; the auditory image exists in " twitter , " and the line of flight through " gathering " ? all relevant images . A blind man , of course , can not perceive visual relations . A color-blind man misses the hues . A man without a rhythmic sense misses balance and the swing of line and the subtleties of repetition . The normality supposed here is that of the average man ? raised to the fullness of his capacities.49  | The assumption of normality lifts aesthetic works of art out of the category of dreams and converts them into social objects , endowing them with an authority as extensive as the society in which this normality endures . When a man is said to have good taste , he is presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of art or type of art under consideration . One thing is certain : a work of art that is totally lacking in vitality is worthless.J0 Pepper concluded that quality is the very essence of life and nature . A man ignorant of depth of quality does not know the substance of life or nature even if he is erudite or efficient . He will not know the inner meaning of his erudition or efficiency . His effectiveness will depend on the insights of other men who did once know . In the end , nothing is valuable but the quality of something.51 Theodore Meyer Greene ( 1897 ? 1969 ) Greene 's The Arts and the Art of Criticism ( 194o ) is less valuable to us now as an original contribution to aesthetics than as an example of a work prestigious in its day . Greene himself admitted that his volume dealt with broad issues discussed for centuries by critics and philosophers , and he was aware that in the estimate of some critics his book did not give the reader a sense of the excitement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , Greene analyzed words , verbal meaning , and metaphor . A word , he said , is a sound or visible mark with an ideational meaning and is therefore essentially symbolic in character . Verbal language is a system of auditory symbols with visual equivalents . Three types of verbal meaning occur : ( 1 ) conceptual , ( 2 ) imagistic , and ( 3 ) emotive-conative . The conceptual core , the associated images , and the emotiveconative suggestions of individual words can all acquire greater precision in a meaningful context , and , by skillful manipulation , words can be made to convey new concepts , fresh images , and novel emotive-conative states devoid of ambiguity . Words uttered have timbre , pitch , intensity , and duration , and in conjunction with inter-  | vening pauses form the basis of metrical and nonmetrical rhythm , or verbal tonality ( " musical quality " ) .53 In every metaphor two ideas arc related in such a way as to illuminate and vitalize one another . The metaphorical relation is essentially one of revealing analogical comparison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene remarked that analogy is of prime importance in every universe of discourse , in mathematics and science , philosophy and history , as well as in literature . Metaphor represents a juxtaposition of ideas one of which is more general , the other more particular . Thus in the metaphors " glaring error " and " marble brow , " error is more general and glaring more particular , marble is more abstract , brow more particular . Metaphors may be expanded into similes , similes into parables or fables and finally into allegories in which abstract ideas of great complexity are set in analogical relation to images of comparable complexity , as in The Pilgrim 's Progress , The Divine Comedy , and The Faerie Queene . Metaphorical relation can be studied in such lines as Shelley 's " Life , like a dome of many-coloured glass , /Sta'ns the white radiance of Eternity " and Coleridge 's " A sunny pleas ' re-dome with caves of ice ! " 54 Time is itself the occasion for metaphoric expression , as when Greene spoke of the moving " present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there is an overlapping of three distinguishable " present " moments . Similarly , William James described the specious present as the " saddleback " of time , and Rossetti defined the sonnet in terms of time , as " a moment 's monument . " 55 Literary composition involves a " translation " of written or printed symbols into their auditory equivalents , and then into their ideational meanings . The central meaning of each word is its conceptual reference to a universal , as in Wordsworth 's A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , all objects of all thought And rolls through all things.56 The literary artist must take into account a factor ignored by the scientist ? the immediate expressiveness of sound . In Spinoza the  | words catch fire from the subject matter ; in Wordsworth , the words are themselves on fire . Literary composition thus arises from an interplay of the conceptual , the imagistic , and the emotive-conative meanings.57 In the section devoted to principles of criticism , Greene discussed the roles of historical inquiry , sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of critical appraisal : ( 1 ) formal excellence , ( 2 ) artistic quality , ( 3 ) artistic integrity , ( 4 ) artistic truth , and ( 5 ) artistic greatness . In discussing artistic greatness , Greene quoted T. S. Eliot : " The greatness ' of literature can not be determined solely by literary standards ; though ... whether it is literature or not can be determined only by literary standards . " He also quoted Shelley : " Poetry enlarges the circumference of the imagination by replenishing it with thoughts of ever new delight , with the power of attracting and assimilating to their own nature all other thought . " 58 Like many earlier aestheticians , Greene discussed the relationship between science and art : Not only does the artist 's generic attitude differ from that of the scientist , he seeks to attain and express a different kind of insight from that which the scientist strives to attain and formulate . Art and science focus upon different aspects of reality and human experience , and the farther they advance , the more pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in being , each in its own way , extensions of man 's normal every-day experience . Both the scientist and the artist not only start with the apprehensions of the common man , they are at pains not to lose contact with the world of ordinary sense-perception.5 ? The artist , said Greene , addresses himself to the particular , but if his work of art is rich in meaning , it transcends the particular , so that the artist becomes as much concerned as the scientist with the apprehension and the interpretation of the universal . The aesthetic factor of elegance is present in art , science , and crafts.60 In art , as in science , clarity of thought and clarity of expression are complementary aspects of a single process.61  | Greene considered artistic perfection as the resolution of three polar tensions : ( I ) simplicity versus complexity , whose resolution is the mean of organic unity ; ( 2 ) order versus novelty , whose mean is expressive originality ; and ( 3 ) the denial versus the idolatry of the medium , whose resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a product of a synthetic resolution of conflicting tendencies , any one of which would , if uncontrolled , destroy all artistic merit.63 In this chapter I have dealt with the analytical approach to aesthetics as presented in the work of Prall , Pepper , and Greene . Prall 's aesthetics was concerned with the knowledge of qualities directly apprehended in sensuous experience . Language , a symbolic medium , may function aesthetically through rhythms and connotations that carry imaginal and emotional meaning . Pepper 's " contextualism " maintained that any experience is a strand whose specific nature becomes clear within the frame of a wider content or texture , which is itself a set of interrelated strands . For Pepper , the aesthetic field is that of intuited quality , which is intensified by novelty and conflict . Intrusive novelty , of which conflict is an extreme case , is particularly evident in words . Emotion , the very essence of quality , lends vitality to imaginative construction , which transmutes a physical work of art into an aesthetic one . The realization of depth of quality depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's contribution was mainly pedagogic . He presented various schematizations : one of verbal meaning ( the conceptual , imagistic , and emotive-conative ) , another of the levels of critical appraisal ( form , quality , integrity , truth , and greatness ) , and another of artistic perfection as the resolution of three polar tensions : simplicity versus complexity , order versus novelty , the denial versus the idolatry of the medium .  | SYMBOLISM AND OTHER AESTHETIC TONALITIES Susanne Langer ( 1895 ? ) : Symbolism Langer 's Philosophy in a New Key : A Study in the Symbolism of Reason , Rite and Art ( 1942 ) was concerned with many of the major issues of literary aesthetics , including problems of language , metaphor , the science-poetry polarity , and symbolism in general.l In her approach to language , Langer differed with such philosophers as Bertrand Russell , Ludwig Wittgenstein , and Rudolf Carnap , for whom language had no meaning except possibly as an expression of feeling and desire , though not of thought . Langer believed that human thought itself is only " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea of feeling " and that " Nature speaks to us , first of all through our senses . " 2 On the relationship of reason to feeling , Langer cited Creighton 's suggestion that feeling itself must participate in knowledge : " The character of the feeling in any experience may be taken as an index of the mind 's grasp of its object . " 3 Following this view , Langer sought to define the articulate forms of feeling . Language , she argued , is generally unable to convey fully " the interplay of feelings with thoughts and impressions " ; music is therefore " the kind of symbolism peculiarly adapted to the explication of the unspeakable . ' " 4  | In her speculations on the nature of language and metaphor , Langer discussed Otto Jespersen 's idea that speech and song may have had a common source , as suggested by J. Donovan in " The Festal Origin of Human Speech . " 5 Langer also cited Philip Wegener , who recognized two general principles of linguistic development : emendation , which begets the syntactical form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All discourse involves two elements : the context ( verbal or practical ) and the novelty . To designate the novelty , the speaker will have recourse to logical analogy ; the context will make it clear that the speaker " can not mean the thing literally denoted , and must mean something else symbolically . " The context indicates , for instance , that the statement , " The king 's anger flares up , " contains no reference to a physical flame ; it is to be taken metaphorically. ? According to Wegener , our literal language is a repository of " faded metaphors . " Examples given by Langer include : " The brook runs swiftly " ; " A rumor runs through the town " ; " A fence runs round the barnyard . " Although the reader does not think here of actual running done by legs , the primitive imagery ( the unconscious analogy with functions of the body ) of running underlies the expression . Wegener said that " the process of fading ... represents the bridge from the first one word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discursive exposition . " Langer added that metaphor is the force that makes language " essentially relational , intellectual , forever showing up new , abstractable forms in reality . . . . " 7 Image making , symbols , metaphor , and myth are all closely connected in a line leading from primitivism to modern sophistication and philosophic formulation . This continuing development is marked by new discovery . It arises from a contemplation that touches the whole cycle of human emotions . Myth is the primitive phase of metaphysical thought , and metaphor facilitates the discovery of new ideas. ? In her discussion of poetry , Langer noted Urban 's statement that the poet does well to keep to symbolic form rather than to literal expression . She also took into account Urban 's suggestion that " poetry is covert metaphysics " and that it is " only when its implications ,  | critically interpreted and adequately expressed , become part of philosophy that an adequate view of the world can be achieved . " What is this critical and adequate expression , Langer asked , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols were untranslatable . Thus poetry is not concerned with the literal assertion but with the way in which the assertion is made : the sound , the tempo , the aura of associations . Poetry is " a form compounded of sound and suggestion , statement and reticence , and no translation can reincarnate that . " 10 In Feeling and Formll Langer discussed Schiller 's concept of Schein , or " semblance , " as a liberating force for perception ; it frees the mind from practical tasks and enables it to dwell on the sheer appearances of things . Langer , influenced by this idea , declared that the function of artistic illusion is not " make-believe " but disengagement from belief : " The knowledge that what is before us has no practical significance in the world is what enables us to give attention to its appearance as such . " On the inseparable nature of image and sight , she cited Remy de Gourmont 's statement that only the visual-minded can " write . " Similarly , William H. Prescott regarded the line , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it suggests nothing visible.12 For modern pragmatists , the two essential functions of language are the conveyance of information and the stimulation of feelings and attitudes in the listener or reader . From this point of view , Langer said , the criticism of poetry must be concerned with such questions as " What is the poet trying to say ? " " What is the poet trying to make us feel ? " For her , however , the fundamental question was : " What has the poet made and how did he make it ? " Words are only the materials from which the poet derives his poetic elements . He then creates the semblance of events ? " a piece of virtual life . " 13 A poem , therefore , is not factual statement versified ; it is the creation of a " symbol of a feeling . " As such , it does not recall " objects which would elicit the feeling itself , " but weaves " a pattern of words ? words charged with meaning , and colored by literary associations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study in Mean-  | ings ( 1924 ) , which revealed , she said , " the same relationships between language and conception , conception and imagination , imagination and myth , myth and poetry , that Cassirer discovered as a result of his reflection on the logic of science . " 15 Langer considered Ernst Cassirer 's laws as exactly similar to Freud 's scattered canons of symbolization . Both depended on the concept of " mythic consciousness , " which Durkheim found in the evolution of totemism , and which Owen Barfield noted in " poetic meaning " or " true metaphor . " Freud 's principle of ambivalence comes into play , she said , because emotional opposites , like joy and grief , desire and fear , " are often very similar in their dynamic structure and reminiscent of each other . " 16 The problem of " pure poetry " elicited from Langer numerous references to Henri Bremond 's La Poesie pure ( 1920 ) , in which " essence " was equated with " magic . " Langer believed that the so-called quality of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emotion ? and on nothing else . She noted that Bremond , like Poe , Shelley , Coleridge , and Swinburne , sought poetic essence to the exclusion of didacticism and discursiveness.17 On the larger question of the meaning of poetry , Langer quoted Prescott 's declaration that poetry is certainly not printed words on paper ; its essential element is " dream-like " and " can not be steadily or attentively contemplated , but may be seen only in glimpses " ; true poetic beauty is inexplicable.18 Ultimately , Langer regarded Prescott 's theory as muddled , because " none of its principles ' really works , freely and without exception , in all instances . " Langer delivered herself of a number of rather dubious , if not downright queer , assertions : Ideas and emotions are dangerous subjects for poetry , the former because a weak poet may be led into discourse on his topic , the latter because he may be tempted to direct utterance , exclamation and catharsis of his own feelings . If ideas and emotions are dangerous , what then is left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good poet uses every bit of the subject  | matter for artistic effect . She did not , however , define her concept of the " good poet , " offering only a rather hackneyed observation : " Everything actual must be transformed by imagination into something purely experiential ; that is the principle of poesis. " 1 ? In her analysis of " dramatic " illusion , Langer quoted Charles Morgan 's statement : " Illusion . . . is form in suspense . " Form , latent in the drama , finally moves toward fulfillment.20 As Langer observed , " Drama is neither ritual nor show business , though it may occur in the frame of either one ; it is poetry , which is neither a kind of circus nor a kind of church . " 21 If drama is poetry , why not say then that it is poetry in the form of dialogue , which , through its verisimilitude , induces in the spectator an illusion of reality ? On this point , Langer quoted Eric Bentley 's observation that " all theatre arts ' are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . " 22 Langer largely refuted Unamuno on the nature of tragedy . Unamuno 's central idea ( essentially Pascalian ) was that man 's greatness and dignity can be found in his " tragic sense of life . " Because Unamuno 's poetic metaphysics could not be argued with in terms to which Langer was accustomed , she declared that " he can not be taken seriously , " although she conceded that " he can not . . . be worsted in argument . " 23 Langer 's work , however , suffers from a lack of precisely that poetic spirit which informed Unamuno 's thought , as in Ferguson 's description of " Purpose , Passion ( or Suffering ) and Perception . " Unamuno 's " We created God to save the universe from Nothingness " 24 might be matched by the reflection that we create beauty in the form of tragedy to save our lives from meaninglessness . This idea recalls Ashley Thorndike 's observation that tragedy " brings home to us the images of our own sorrows , and chastens the spirit through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the misfortune of our fellows . " Thorndike 's assertion , " It is the function of Literature to unite the world of experience and the world of vision , " 25 may be matched by Unamuno 's declaration that the basic problem in philosophy is to conciliate self and cosmos . Such views were often inadequately appreciated in Langer 's work . On the role of intuition , Langer considered Bergson and Croce.  | Croce 's intuition , as she saw it , was not Bergson 's blind " taking possession " or emotional experience of " reality . " For Croce , it was an act of perception whereby content is turned into form . Langer charged Croce with looseness of language and with some logically inadmissible steps that led to his metaphysics of " the Spirit . " The result for aesthetics is , she believed , a confusion resulting from the identification of intuition and expression . A work of art is essentially in the artist 's mind and is only duplicated in its material form.26 Langer attempted to impose " logic " on Croce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have called logical expression , ' no matter how much he might protest the word logical . ' " In her view , Croce 's " science " of nonintellectual knowledge needed a recognition of nondiscursive symbolization : " All cognition of form is intuitive ; all relatedness ? distinctness , congruence , correspondence of forms , contrast , and synthesis in a total gestalt ? can be known only by direct insight which is intuition . " Although Langer relied here on the authority of Ernst Cassirer , 27 her views at this point closely resembled those of Croce . Unlike Croce and R. G. Collingwood , however , Langer did not define " technique " as tantamount to " manufacture . " Noting that the crafts provide opportunities for the creation of works of art , she insisted that the artist must know beforehand what he is about to create and what form he is to give it . Mere feeling on the part of the artist might lead to " aestheticism . " She declared further that the products of the artist 's creation outgrow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Keats 's notion of the " impersonality " of the artist , and her observations on the work of art and its public closely resembled those of Jean-Marie Guyau and Dewey . In Mind : An Essay on Human Feeling ( 1967 ) , Langer remarked that Santayana 's process of objectification resembled her own idea of " projection . " His concept , however , implied not symbolic projection but the supposed process of " projecting " sensations actually occurring in our own bodies onto an outside world as qualities of " matter . " Langer , however , found Santayana 's ideas dated largely as a result of a shift from the psychology of sensation and association  | to a concept tentatively built on principles of symbol and meaning . In general , she dismissed the resemblances between Santayana 's theory and her own.29 She noted further that Santayana 's term " projection " was more explicitly defined by Bernard Bosanquet as " symbolic projection. " 30 In her examination of the nature of poetry , Langer turned to Eliot 's " objective correlative , " through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula for a given emotion . She noted that this principle failed to provide a means by which the artist could transform his feelings into objective expression . Her views here are reminiscent of George Eliot 's observation : " To be a poet is to have a soul . . . in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge . " 31 Langer herself summarized the significance of her work as follows : The theory itself that of the Art Symbol , which I have here set forth , is not really one person 's work . It is a step ? and I think , an important one ? in a philosophy of art on which many aestheticians have already labored , the theory of expressive form . . . . It was Cassirer ? though he never regarded himself as an aesthetician ? who hewed the keystone of the structure , in his broad and disinterested study of symbolic forms ; and I , for my part , would put the stone in place , to join and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1901 ? 1969 ) : Poetry , Logic , and Myth Wheelwright 's background for the study of literary aesthetics was enviably rich in both range and depth . He combined the probing discrimination of the philosopher and the sensitivity of the poet . He wrote on general philosophy , Aristotle , Heraclitus , metaphor , literary criticism , and the nature of poetry . In " Toward a Metaphysic of Literary Criticism " Wheelwright proposed a threefold task for literary criticism : ( i ) to define , analyze , and , by implication , evaluate " the sphere of reality to which a given  | work refers " ; ( 2 ) to estimate " the adequacy of the work to the sphere of reality thus defined " ; and ( 3 ) , on the basis of ( I ) and ( 2 ) , to determine the value of the work . Although the critic should recognize the distinction between his subject and those of the scientist and the philosopher , he should also " accept a metaphysic that attributes a genuine reality to his field as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of metaphor in philosophy and in literature . Whereas in the former , metaphor tends to be merely illustrative , in the latter it is a necessary form , without which " the reality to which the work refers would not be the same . " 33 He seems to have agreed with Ramon Fernandez , whom he quoted , that " the fundamental problem of aesthetics is no other than the metaphysical problem of being , but transposed to the plane of imagination "  --  that , in general , " aesthetics must be an imaginative ontology. " 34 In his " Poetry and Logic , " Wheelwright expressed his indebtedness to Louis Grudin 's A Primer of Aesthetics ( 1930 ) . This work , which is concerned with verbal logic , tried to establish aesthetics as an area of authentic and verifiable knowledge . Grudin discussed energy as a symbol of change in physics and quoted A. N. Whitehead to the effect that " energy is merely the name for the qualitative aspect of a structure of happenings . " He did not explicitly indicate , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to psychic energy ( that of will ) . Grudin saw the poet and his poem bound together as contextual symbol . For him , a poem has a signatory role : " A poem may mean different things to different readers , yet remain fixed as a verbal context in each case . " 35 Beauty was identifiable with " ultimately significant " symbolization : " The strictly contextual relation called beauty is distinct from the relation called the symbol 's truth respecting the object . The relation of truth is meant aside from the relation of beauty . " For Grudin , prose begins and ends with a signatory order . Prose remains such , even when there is a lapse from truth , " while a lapse from beauty produces banal poetry rather than prose . " 36 Following Grudin , Wheelwright mentioned the distinction between the poetically intelligible and the logically intelligible . Philo-  | sophic language , he felt , falls short of " the verbal chemistries that poetry effects " ; the abstractions of philosophy can not give birth to a King Lear 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ReaIity , " Wheelwright asserted that lack of poetic response may be a very serious matter , for it may indicate " the general sickness of our contemporary society . " He pointed out the utter disaster that is to be faced in three prestigious doctrines : behaviorism , instrumentalism , and semantic positivism . They have in common a positivistic materialism for which the only truth is experimental truth . For them , poetic truth is a fiction that supplies a certain " emotional heightening . " " Our modern dilemma , as Wheelwright saw it , goes back to Descartes . The Ego-Phenomena ( EP ) axis cuts across the Myth-Community axis . Today , he maintained , the philosophy of the EP axis has reached its most intractable expression in behaviorism , instrumentalism , and semantic positivism ? all of them reducing the human mind to what can be proven experimentally . Impersonal experimentalism and voluminous literalism have led us into a blind alley . " The way out , Wheelwright suggested , is through a proper understanding of myth as the expression of a profound sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on that of feeling and the wholeness of living . In Wheelwright 's opinion , poetry today is inhibited by a dearth of shared consciousness of myth , which has a history . To his remark that what matters is the myth consciousness of the next generation , 40 I might add that a new Edenic myth ( compounded of freedom , love , and " one 's own thing " ) is now growing apace among the young . It is too early yet for the process to have evolved a clear-cut aesthetic . Many signs , however , already indicate that it may be more closely related to the chthonic and the unconscious than to any sophisticated semantic . No investigation of the nature of poetry is possible without an examination of the nature of language . Wheelwright addressed himself to this question in The Burning Fountain : A Study in the Language of Symbolism.41 He noted that " this book is about expressive language . . . which is to be described as poetic . " In general , he called  | the language of poetry expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes logical " he called steno-language . One is not cut off from the benefits of the other . The poem , as an instrument of sensitivity , implies a rich coalescence of knowledge and feeling in the creator and a stimulus for the re-creation of that amalgam in the reader . Poetry ... quickens and guides man 's associative faculty , keeps it in athletic trim and thus actually generates new meanings ? meanings that would lose their identity outside the context of the individual poem , but which are authentically real within the poem.42 Metaphor , central in the poetic structure , was for Wheelwright not a stratagem of grammar but of semantic import . As he saw it , the difference between metaphor and simile is merely one of rhetorical strategy . He found no semantic difference between the statement " He dances like a clumsy elephant " ( simile ) and " That clumsy elephant gets in everyone 's way . " Wheelwright noted that Aristotle called simile " a metaphor with a preface . " For Wheelwright , a real metaphor is characterized by the factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living language as such is marked by tension , especially in poetry.43 Any discussion of metaphor involves " the mind 's primary activity of integration " ? what Coleridge called " the primary imagination . " Wheelwright concluded The Burning Fountain with several telling metaphors : The end of the turning wheel is the still axis which is the arche of its turning . The end of the cosmic dance is the quietude of love beyond desire . The end of dying is the everrenewed threshold experience of potential rebirth.44 In Metaphor and Reality Wheelwright , like Langer , credited Cassirer 's The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms with having entered deeply into " the interrelations of sense-awareness , mental judgment , use of language , myth , and art . " 45  | The tensive character of language is especially felt in poetry , which is essentially " dramatic " and has overtones of universality . By reason of its openness , poetic language tends toward semantic plenitude and toward the " polysemous " ( Michel Breal 's term ) . Wheelwright cited the use of the word " key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard the key/Turn in the door once and turn once only . " The word in question carries other meanings besides itself , implying metaphoric use.46 Wheelwright also referred to Wallace Stevens and to Sister Bernetta , both of whom identified metaphor with symbolic metamorphosis . Such an approach involved the molding and remolding of essences and forms into new configurations by metamorphic insight.47 For Stevens and Frost , poetry was essentially a matter of metaphor . For Wheelwright , the most interesting metaphors were those in which epiphor and diaphor are combined.48 Wheelwright offered a broad definition of the term " symbol " : A Symbol , in general , is a relatively stable and repeatable element of perceptual experience , standing for some larger meaning or set of meanings which can not be given , or not fully given , in perceptual experience itself . Steno-symbols ( indispensable to science ) must have a public exactitude . Tensive symbolism is never perfectly exact . The tensive symbol draws life from a multiplicity of associations , for the most part subconscious . Wheelwright showed that Carlyle was speaking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is concealment and yet revelation . . . silence and speech acting together . " 49 Archetypal symbols , like " light , " for example , carry the same or very similar meanings for most of mankind . This symbol seems to be particularly well fitted to represent mind with its discriminatory power.5o Myth , as Wheelwright saw it , involves an interplay of human thought , feeling , imagination , and language . Because imaginative language is basically metaphoric , a natural collision occurs between metaphor and myth in man 's attempts to discover and utter " the inner meaning of the universe and of human life . " 51 Both epiphoric  | and diaphoric activities occur in early developments of symbol and myth . Epiphor appears wherever man sees through the immediate to some lurking , " higher " reality . A diaphoric mythoid ( an incipient myth ) involves a synthesis of two or more forms charged with immediacy . To exemplify a mythoid in which the diaphoric element is observable and strong , Wheelwright pointed to the triple symbolism of Woman ( A ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . This pattern is repeated in various cultures . Each of the three images is likened to each of the others by a particular characteristic . A and B both give milk ; A and C have monthly periods ; B and C wear horns ? and to that extent their relations are epiphoric . The total triadic grouping , however , when viewed in a single apperception by early man , is diaphoric.52 Wheelwright came close to dealing with a universal mathesis in which poetry and science are conjointly involved in the quest of reality . Thus , he did speak of a poetically significant I ? the I that enters into the making and reception of a poem ? which consists of visual , auditory , motor , and structural images . Such images , he said , point and hint at something beyond . For Wheelwright , reality was perspectival ; he believed that any treatment of reality will show forth its own ontological limits . Something always exists " beyond . " Wheelwright 's thought implied a poetic power that can break through all rigid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of extreme importance for an aesthetics of literature . Bernard C. Heyl ( 19o5 ? ) : The Multiple Meanings of Art , Beauty , and Artistic Truth In a work published prior to Wheelwright 's The Burning Fountain , Heyl treated the crucial aspects of artistic analysis ? the multiple meanings of " art , " " beauty , " " artistic truth , " " objectivism , " " subjectivism , " and " relativism " ? against the background of semantics.53 He cited Carnap , Langer , Wheelwright , I. A. Richards , A. J. Ayer , and  | Samuel I. Hayakawa , among others . Curiously enough , Heyl 's quotation from Sir Charles Sherrington 's Man on His Nature ( 1941 ) seems to have given the lie to the semantic positivists , who too often gave the impression that finitude or finality in meaning was possible : Kant seems to assume the human mind to be a finished thing , a completed item of existence . But the human mind is part of a tide of change which , in its instance , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running like a mill-race . Many living things are all the time busy becoming something other than what they are . And this , our mind , with the rest . It is being made along with our planet 's making . We do not know that it ever will be finished.54 What is true of mind is true for the means of expressing it , namely , language . Meanings change with contexts . Because the transaction between mind and its environment is necessarily fluid , so is the expression of that transaction . We should not wonder , then , at the diversity of interpretations of the terms " art " and " beauty " and the inadequacy of contemporary art criticism and aesthetics , to which Heyl pointed . Accordingly , he felt that " it is both unnecessary and undesirable to use the epithet artistic truth ' in esthetics and in art criticism . " 55 Value judgment is equally devious and quixotic , even among famous critics . Heyl 's six criteria for determining the so-called " expert " resolved themselves to educational and technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unless standards and rules are eternal and immutable they are not rules and criteria at all is childish . " 56 If pressed for the meaning of such terms as " beauty , " " artistic quality , " and " esthetic quality , " the so-called objectivist critic will be forced to consider them unanalyzable . Thus Theodore Meyer Greene was cited as saying : " Like color and sound , beauty is an irreducible , unique , and ineffable quality . " 57 Heyl maintained that the objectivist is engaged in a metaphysical chase for a nonexistent entity and that his very goal may be aesthetically and psychologically dangerous.58 The alternative to objectivism is subjectivism , which is repudiated  | by those who seek a basis for reasoned estimation and discrimination . Again Dewey was quoted : The conception that mere liking is adequate to constitute a value situation makes no provision for the education and cultivation of taste and renders criticism , whether esthetic , moral , or logical , arbitrary and absurd . Intervening between the subjectivists and the objectivists , the art historian Kurt Koffka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated " some tenable theory " that would avoid the extremes of objectivism ( the single-scale idea ) and of subjectivism ( the supposition no common scale exists ) . He favored a " wholesome elasticity and variety " in criticism.UO Bertram Morris ( 1908 ? ) : The Satisfied Imagination In the same year that Heyl 's book appeared ( 1943 ) , Bertram Morris 's The Aesthetic Process was published . Impressed by the works of Samuel Alexander , Dewey , Whitehead , and Bergson , Morris intended " to construct a positive aesthetic theory , which we may call the theory of the satisfied imagination . " 61 He recognized in empathy one of the most significant psychological concepts in aesthetics . As Theodor Lipps remarked , " The object is myself and by the very same token this self of mine is the object . " 62 The concrete , aesthetic object is to be found in feeling , which is consonant with activity : " In art , gay colors leap , distressing sounds groan , dolorous tones cry . " In the aesthetic experience the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied imagination was implicit in Mortis 's definition of beauty ? " the expression of a purpose in a sensuous medium . " 64 Like many other aestheticians , Morris ran into the problem of the polarity between science and art . With the end of developing the thesis that " expression of purpose is the unfolding of meaning , " he compared some of the salient features of scientific inquiry  | with the art process . Science , he said , refuses to accept purposive relations ; in art , purposiveness engenders the contemplative . Although purpose in science is intellectual and confirmable , in art it is sensuous and emotional.65 Morris felt that Dewey oversimplified the identification of scientific operational procedure with the aesthetic . Morris went so far as to say that " The externality of the relations in the one science as compared with the internality in the other art makes the identification a travesty . " 66 Morris 's insight into aesthetic activity as being more closely related to a drama of imagery than to trains of imagery is worth stressing.67 One might paraphrase this by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linear . In this dialectic , feeling is , as Morris said , the productive factor , and images bring feeling to dramatic expression . Mere intellectualism will not produce art . Poets mean more than they intend.08 For Morris , aesthetic analysis was far removed from mathematical analysis : " If beauty could be proved , art would not admit of new interpretations . " Propositions can not mediate the aesthetic object , and technique is not a guarantee of art : " The virtue of metaphorical judgment consists in its expressiveness . . . in its feeling-tone .... " fi9 Morris 's reflections on symbolism led him to certain remarks on sentimentalism . He stated that where the symbolic dominates art , sentimentalism necessarily results , as when , for example , the sight of the handkerchief recalls the beloved . " 70 I have had occasion earlier to note the rather facile , pejorative references to sentimentality , without taking into account the full nature of so-called sentimentalism . If the literary symbol is meant to be a mere objet d'art Ea thing of words . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , words in poetry ( literature ) are meant to signify something beyond themselves , then what argument can be raised against the wistfulness and the sense of painful regret generated by an object once associated with someone now gone ? If by sentimentalism is meant specious or false feeling , then let us address ourselves , in our aesthetic reflections , to this problem . Who is to determine the probity of feelings roused by a poem or any work of art ? Morris quoted Eliot : " The sentimental person , in whom a work of art arouses all sorts of emotions which have nothing to do  | with art whatever , but are accidents of personal associations , is an incomplete artist . " One hears here the stentorian voice of the Mogul Critic who blares out from his mountaintop : " Thou shalt not commit non-T.S . Eliot feelings in responding to poems or you will be damned as a philistine and a sentimentalist who knows absolutely nothing about ART . " The " complete adequacy of the external to the emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 71 is something that everyone feels intuitively or not at all . Intuitions arc not to be instructed by constantly brandishing before them the heresy of the sentimental . The principles of criticism are closely related to the theory of the satisfied imagination . Within them , Morris felt , aesthetic theory will find validation to the extent that they relate concretely to our actual appreciation.72 Aristotle , Dewey , and Whitehead , among others , insisted that the real meaning of art is experience itself . It is a way of coming to grips with the world.73 Morris offered the following categorization of criticism : ( 1 ) genetic criticism , ( 2 ) aesthetic criticism , and ( 3 ) higher criticism . The first , most fully used by art historians , is , in Morris 's opinion , incompletely aesthetic . The second rests on the principles of the metaphorical judgment . Whitehead said that great art " transforms the soul into the permanent realization of values extending beyond its former self . " The so-called higher criticism stems from " those rare critics who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected art . " 14 For Morris , aesthetic criticism comes closest to serving the objectives of the satisfied imagination . Eventually , all these forms of criticism tend to converge in their common cultural interest . It is worth repeating Morris 's statement that " art is a liberating activity which gives direction to human power . " 75 Morris Weitz ( 1916 ? ) : Toward a New Analysis In his Philosophy of the Arts ( 1950 ) , Weitz cited Clive Bell 's opinion that literature can never be pure art because it is concerned primarily with facts and ideas and , as such , is primarily intellectual . To this ,  | Weitz added that poetry becomes pure only when it is resolved into music . Weitz pointed out that unlike Bell , who distinguished between the aesthetics of painting and literature , R. E. Fry attempted to explain all the arts by means of the principle of significant form . For him , the essence of literature was to be found in the relation of inevitability ? " the vivid sense of the inevitability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea two serious internal difficulties : ( i ) It is incomplete because it deals only with tragedy . ( 2 ) In making inevitability the essence of literature , literature is reduced to the instinctual level of experience , " from which it follows that there can be no aesthetic emotion so far as our response to literature is concerned . " 77 Weitz maintained that " to say that art is significant form is to say that it is also significant content . " In this he found himself sustained by DeWitt H. Parker , A. C. Barnes , and A. C. Bradley , in spite of their superficial distinction between form and content . In any concrete work of art an organic relation exists between the two.78 For the best statement of this principle as it applies to poetry , Weitz singled out that of Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren in their Understanding Poetry . A poem , they said , does not consist of " a group of mechanically combined elements ? meter , rime , figurative language , idea , etc. , put together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall . " They suggested that a poem is comparable to a plant . The organic theory repudiates the distinction between the what and the how ( content and form ) .79 For Weitz , then , a poem is an organic complex of expressive elements : words , images , allusions , metrics , subjects , themes . It is always " much richer than its printed meanings . " The cult of unintelligibility , he seems to have suggested , can be overcome by grasping the symbols within a poem . He took " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock " as an example . Here we have the symbols of the etherized patient , the coffee spoons , Prufrock himself , and the act of drowning . Weitz followed Cleanth Brooks in seeing in this poem " the unfolding of a tremendous double metaphor " ? life and death on the meaningless plane of conventionality and life and death as directed toward salva-  | tion , with Prufrock himself as " the epitome of the conflict between the two ways of life and death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 81 has raised the important question of whether art is only emotive or whether it is referential as well . Thus , T. M. Greene maintained ( at length ) that art can lay claims to " propositional truth , " while Heyl and John Hospers succeeded , Weitz believed , in exposing the inadequacies of Greene 's position . As a way out of this controversy , Parker posited the concept of " depth meaning . " When , for example , Frost says , " Nothing gold can stay , " " gold " has both its surface meaning and its depth meaning , the more universal idea that nothing valuable can abide . Weitz pointed out , however , that other instances contain truth claims as surface sentences ( Longfellow 's " A Psalm of Life " or Shakespeare 's " Let me not to the marriage of true minds " ) and not necessarily as depth meanings . Weitz concluded that " the emotive theory is simply false in its assertion that no art contains referential meanings . " 82 Recognizing the noble efforts of Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new analysis was needed . He began with the fundamental contribution of the New Criticism , namely , that ... a poem is an organic complex of constituents , including the theme . Toward these , but especially the theme , when it functions as a truth claim , there are at least four cognitive attitudes that one can assume : indifference or unconcern , makebelieve , acceptance of belief , and rejection or disbelief . Richards , Weitz claimed , was not at all clear whether poetry can not be referential and embody truth claims or ought not to be so . What ought to be challenged is Richards 's underlying idea ? that truth claims fall within the province of science , not of poetry . This , said Weitz , is false . No psychologist has equalled a Proust or a Dostoyevski in the assessment of human motivation . The wisdom of literature is lacking in science . Accordingly , Richards 's indifference to truth claims in art will not do . The recommendation that we treat poetic claims of truth as if they were true is cognitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The make-believe theory has no explanations for the attitude of the readers who do find that much of poetry does embody truth or truth claims.83 Reading well , which Brooks underlined as important for the understanding of poetry , was , for Weitz , reading with an eye for rich human possibilities and " the liberating effects they offer us . " For him , it was " the liberating function of the aesthetic experience . " 84 Under " Voluntarism , " Weitz considered Freud 's as well as Parker 's theories of art . Parker agreed with Freud that artistic activity is akin to the dream and that the dream itself is dominated by desire . The imagination , dominated by desire , exists , in fact , for the purpose of satisfying desires . The imaginative satisfaction of desire that takes place wholly within the person is as genuine as that which comes from the appropriation of some object from the environment . Weitz sided with Parker in this view , as against Curt Ducasse , who was Parker 's most severe critic . Finding Freud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of desires ? but not merely of frustrated desires . For Weitz , the aesthetic experience was not a form of sublimation : " It is as real and direct a form of satisfaction of desire as our satisfying our sexual desire in the experience of sexual intercourse. " 85 Weitz further examined the contemplation theory held by Ducasse , Bell , Edward Bullough , and Roger Fry . Ducasse interpreted contemplation as a mild form of emotional indulgence or infection . To this Weitz was strongly opposed because of its reductive quality and its tone of prohibitiveness for a full artistic expression . Bullough 's theory of contemplation , which Weitz considered more adequate , involved a bipolarity of action and detachment that Bullough called " psychical distance , " which I have discussed earlier . With Bell and Fry , Weitz regarded the contemplative attitude toward art as a way of securing a unique experience , one that is not " caused by an indulgence in the emotion of the art object but by the contemplative experience itself . It is in this sense that appreciation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of criticism , and the expression of taste that goes with it , Weitz admitted that he knew of no refutation against Ducasse 's claim that any ultimate criterion in evaluation is an emo-  | tive preference and not something referential and objective . Still he felt that this is tantamount to nihilism , which , while irrefutable , is ( at least for him ) totally unacceptable.S7 Weitz , too , asked , " What II about the sentimental and the saccharine in art ? " Is a work like The Sorrows of Werther as good , aesthetically , as Hamlet ? Weitz admitted that here an axiology is involved that may meet with skepticism on the part of some.S8 I have already indicated my own reflections on this problem . Here I wish to add that open-faced confrontation of the facts of the human condition in the vast context of the cosmic swirl reduces the human comedy to a sentimental blink . It is precisely this blink , however , that affords us our sentimental education , which turns on such matters as beauty , drama , the grotesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly changing .  | THE NEW CRITICISM The New Criticism defies definition , except by contrast with the older criticism . Whereas older criticism related itself to history , biography , philosophy , and even to some branches of science , the New Criticism regarded all such relationships as irrelevant for a true understanding of literature . Its poetic ontology recognized only structural tensions and their resolutions within the literary work itself . The elements to be dealt with were diction , rhythm , metaphor , symbol , semantic pointers , and texture . Life was , at best , a tangential consideration . Tradition was a desideratum only insofar as it revealed tonalities of literary pattern . Douglas Day ( 1932 ? ) In " The Background of the New Criticism , " Douglas Day stated that the so-called New Criticism began in the first decade of the twentieth century . Although the work of the New Critics differed from Joel Spingarn 's brand of " creative " criticism , they welcomed his emphasis on the sensibility of the poet and the inseparability of form and content . Further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Critics agreed with his emphasis on the importance of form and the critic 's need for an erudite sense of the past.l They also responded to the influential theories of Remy de Gourmont and Thomas Ernest Hulme.  | For Gourmont , poetry presented a three-stage process : sensation , image words , and sentiment words ( words expressing feeling ) . Stage one ( the sensuous apprehension of concrete experience ) vitalizes the other two stages.2 Gourmont 's linkage of sensibility with the poetic description of concrete , physical experience is definitely echoed , Day felt , in T. S. Eliot 's objective correlative.3 Hulme , according to Sir Herbert Read , derived much from Gourmont , but Gourmont 's concept of the poem as dependent largely on the sensibility of the poet , showed him , as Day perceived , to be closer to romantic impressionism than would be acceptable to Hulme . Hulme asserted that the romantic is a sentimentalist ( that ghost again ! ) who is much concerned with his " damp " feelings . By contrast , the classical poet will be dry , emotionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of flirting with the infinite .4 The classical poet is characterized by his concentrated state of mind and by his self-control in the expression of his perceptions.5 The complexity of a poem arises from the use of metaphorical analogies . Each " part of a poem is modified by the other 's presence , and each is , to a certain extent , the whole . " As a disciple of Bergson , Hulme held that the organic form of a poem is a function of intuition . The artist must be able to transcend appearance to perceive a reality beyond it.7 As was the case with Gourmont , in Day 's view , Hulme did not actually break away from the romantic expressionism he opposed . ' Although Hulme is still remembered as the founder of the imagist movement , the movement was actually under Ezra Pound 's control from his introduction of Les Imagistes in his Ripostes in 1912 until , as Day put it ; Amy Lowell usurped his throne in 1914 n T. S. Eliot was greatly influenced by Pound , whom he described as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Pound he supposedly learned the necessity for a return to a poetry of impersonality and unemotionality , which would convey the reality of everyday experience through concrete imagery.10 Eliot was also deeply obligated to Poe for his views on the independence of poetry from morals , politics , and biography . He was further influenced by Poe 's idea that the emotions provoked by a poem are different from those arising in the mind of the poet . His  | thoughts on the poet 's " impersonality " were anticipated by Keats , while his idea of the poem as an independent organism is actually derived from Coleridge . On the role of sensibility , he was instructed by his master , Remy de Gourmont . " Eliot 's notion of the objective correlative , which emphasized the work itself as a structure , was to become , Day pointed out , the touchstone of the New Criticism . According to that notion , the poem is an objectification of the emotions that arise within the poet ; it should therefore constitute the critic 's principal concern.12 In consonance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contended that Eliot 's thought is a complex blend of classicism and the extreme form of romanticism that he and his contemporaries had presumably opposed . " The work of Eliot served to transmit the crucial ideas found in Gourmont , Hulme , and Pound . It thus provided a general attitude for the New Critics . Their critical method , however , was actually provided by I. A. Richards 's Principles of Literary Criticism ( 1924 ) . Here Richards described two ways in which impulse may be organized : inclusion and exclusion , or synthesis and elimination . Richards indicated that the poetry of inclusion is the worthier of the two , in that its aim is the presentation of a maximum number of conflicting impulses . This sort of poetry lends itself to critical analysis . The poetry of exclusion , seeking the presentation of a minimum number of conflicting impulses , is little more than a direct statement of a single attitude , and is therefore not particularly rewarding as a subject for extensive critical analysis . Inclusive poetry makes use of a factor that Richards calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite , the complementary impulses ; that is why poetry which is opposed to it is not of the highest order , and why irony itself is so constantly a characteristic of poetry which is.14 The critic 's task is to unravel the complex network of meanings provided by the poet 's skillful use of irony , paradox , and ambiguity .  | Some critics welcome obscurity because it provides an opportunity for the exercise of their ingenuity . At any rate , Day saw Richards as one who contributed to modern criticism a method of textual interpretation that could do away with subjective generalities.15 Day concluded that the New Critics were classical in only two respects : their requirement that the poet limit his imaginative faculty to the treatment of the world perceived by the senses , and their demand that poets and critics alike pay closer attention to form and structure . Although Eliot and Richards made significant contributions in these respects , Day argued that their theories must finally be classified as broadly romantic , because they stress the abnormal sensibility of the poet and the organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Critics prevented them from reaching any common ground on which to found a unified critical theory . " John Crowe Ransom ( 1888 ? ) Perhaps the most prestigious critical summary of the New Criticism was offered by Ransom . This approach , he said , had been damaged by its use of a psychological affective vocabulary . He noted that Richards subordinated the cognitive element in experience to the emotive , and the emotive to the conative . In the interest of objectivity , Ransom preferred the terms " cause , " " character , " and " consequence , " respectively , to " cognition , " " emotion , " and " conation . " In opposition to the romantic and psychological view of the arts as vehicles for raising and communicating passion , Ransom maintained that whereas art starts with feelings and passions , it " proposes to find and explore the appropriate objects and in that sense to objectify and lose them . " 17 Ransom persisted in associating Richards 's view of poetry with romantic escapism and morbid self-indulgence . But Ransom 's cavilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's characterization of Eliot 's technique as " a music of ideas . " Surely , Ransom knew that this phrase suggests the sense of harmony and tunefulness invoked by certain ideas in poetry and even in philosophy . His casuistry became high-handed  | when he asserted : " Emotions themselves are fictions , and critical theory could not with a straight face have recourse to them . " 18 As might be expected , Ransom balked at the inclusion of " feelings " in Richards 's description of the four separate meanings of a poem : sense ( thought or meaning ) , feelings , tone , and intention . The critic , Ransom argued , need attend only to the objective situations : " The feelings will be their strict correlatives , and the pursuit of feelings will be gratuitous . " Richards described sentimentality as an overly facile or excessively copious affective response by the reader . For Ransom and Eliot , sentimental responses are stock responses to poems that do not warrant them . Thus most poets appear to stand condemned of indulging in affective activities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ransom , Eliot , and company ? are capable of precise cognition . Even Richards is excluded from this elect hierarchy.19 On the question of beauty in a poem , Ransom concluded that , lacking any satisfactory accounts of beauty , anyone may make his own definition.20 Ransom recognized that in the analysis of metaphor Richards had furnished two extremely important terms : " tenor " and " vehicle . " The first is the original context , the given discourse ; the second is the importation of foreign context . Thus , in lines quoted by Richards from " Cooper Hill , " Sir John Denham addressed the Thames : O could I flow like thee , and make thy stream My great exemplar as it is my theme ! Though deep , yet clear ; though gentle , yet not dull , Strong without rage ; without o'erflowing full . Here , Richards commented , the poet 's mind is the tenor and the river the vehicle . And he pointed out that the last two lines contain a repeated alternation of the relative positions of tenor and vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the stream should be taken as the tenor , because Denham begins with it and calls it his " theme , " while , for Ransom , the speaker 's mind is actually the vehicle . Metaphor , Ransom remarked , is usually more spontaneous than this.22  | According to Ransom , the study of Coleridge caused Richards to modify his earlier views . Particularly influential was Coleridge 's concept of the poetic imagination as an " esemplastic " faculty that unifies opposites . It furnishes a kind of " interanimation " between the opposed parts of the metaphor ( the tenor and the vehicle in Richards 's terms ) . Ransom believed that the metaphor is " a sort of second poem attached to the given poem , like the epicycles by which the Ptolemaic theory complicated the pure orbits of the heavenly bodies . " He conceded ( rather condescendingly ) the existence of an " obvious intelligence " in Richards 's declaration that metaphor is the " omnipresent principle of language " ( a fact , incidentally , recognized by philologists before Richards ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct " habits told him that he had been fighting with his colleagues over the technical advisability of introducing any analogies whatever into scientific argument , because of the difficulties of holding the mind to the exact " point of analogy . " 23 Such scientists as J. Bronowski and Gaston Bachelard , however , offered other views on the role of analogy and metaphor in the play of the imagination in both art and science . Bronowski , a scientist of a high order and also an author of one of the best books on Blake , wrote : He the active scientist knows that science is not something which insects or machines can do . What makes it different is a creative process ... . The world which the human mind knows and explores does not survive if it is emptied of thought . And thought does not survive without symbolic concepts . The symbol and the metaphor are as necessary to science as to poetry.24 The gaucherie and limitation in Ransom 's thought can be seen in his adherence to a sort of Chinese Wall between science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many first-rate scientists and poets , namely , that man is the cosmos thinking , or , as Emerson put it , " The universe is the externization of the soul . " 25 Ransom felt that Richards had varying success in his analysis of  | the problems of tragedy , irony , and associated forms of wit . For Ransom , Richards 's account of the conflict between pity and terror is more rhetorical than realistic . Tragedy , in Ransom 's view , belongs to a biological-logical category.2 ? After Richards , Ransom discussed Eliot , whose The Waste Land he called " the most famous poem of our age . " In Eliot , Ransom saw the clash of a Dr. Jekyll ( the critic ) and a Mr. Hyde ( the poet ) . In For Launcelot Andrews ( 1928 ) ? where Eliot declared himself a classicist in literature , a royalist in politics , and an Anglo-Catholic in religion ? he described poetry as autelic ? that is as having itself as an end , independent of anything else . Because Eliot used historical studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot might be called an historical critic , a critical scholar in the tradition of Dryden or Dr. Johnson . If Eliot , said Ransom , was one of the most important sources of a new criticism , it was because here ( in the new criticism ) was in part the recovery of old criticism . No poet can be valued apart from a tradition to which he belongs.27 Ransom followed Eliot 's ideas on the relative roles of emotions and feelings in the creative act : " Probably the most important thing in Eliot 's statement is his recognition of big emotions as set off against little feelings . . . . The emotion attaches to the main structure of the poem , the feelings attach to the local texture . " He went on to say that Richards would hardly have talked , as did Eliot , about a fusion of " feelings , phrases , images into one compound . " 28 Surprisingly , Ransom complained that Eliot 's pronouncement had something painful to the humble reader " when he suggests that there is something esoteric in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humble reader is not . " 29 Ransom came close to recognizing his own superciliousness in another critic . For Eliot , sensibility was the organ that produced feelings . Ransom , however , seems to have opposed a psychological magic that valued feeling above thought . He favored something ... much tamer and more credible : the procedure of suspending the course of the main thought while we explore the private  | character of the detail items . We stop following the main thought , and take off in a different direction , as we follow the private history of an item ; then we come back to the main thought.3o Ransom also analyzed Yvor Winters 's Primitivism and Decadence 1937 ) , in which Winters cited Mallarme 's idea that words have an obvious ( that is , a rational ) meaning , and an essential fringe of feeling . Following this , Winters maintained that the element peculiar to the poem and wanting to the prose is precisely the " fringe of feeling " that constitutes everywhere in the poem a vivid texture , and that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have ignored the idea that a poem is more than its rational content . Winters believed that the feeling in certain poems is inseparable from what we call poetic form ? form being the shaping of a given experience . The poem consists in the relationship between the rational content and the feeling.31 Ransom wished that Winters 's evaluation of Baudelaire had dispensed with " the business of the moral evaluation ' and the spiritual control ' " ; Baudelaire was " beyond good and evil at the stage when he is writing poetry ; he is not practically moved by them . " 32 In the course of his rather cluttered discussion of Winters 's two essays " The Experimental School in American Poetry " and " The Influence of Meter in Poetic Composition , " Ransom struck an Emersonian note when he stated that . . . nature is almost inevitably the symbol for aesthetic experience . Nature is nearly all texture , with such multitude of forms as to be practically formless . Probably the hardest problem of the artist handling it is to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an ontological account of poetry in the semantic system of Charles W. Morris , who recognized three irreducible forms of discourse : science , art , and technology . Discussing the credibility of aesthetic discourse , Morris declared that ,  | like scientific discourse , it is objective and knowledge-giving . Ransom noted , however , that whereas scientific signs have no character other than that of referring to one another , aesthetic signs are " icons " or images . Thus , " man " is the scientific sign , whereas " this particular man " is the iconic sign . The icon of Hamlet , for example , is never twice the same . Such principles , Ransom reflected , are ontological . Art , concerned with the qualitative value of the actual world , defies the restrictiveness of science.34 In accord with the ontological analysis of poetry , Ransom believed that the development of metrical content parallels that of meaning , as indicated by the endless revisions of poets . The veteran poet senses the aesthetic value of the interplay , in the total structure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontologically , it is a case of bringing into experience both a denser and a more contingent world , and commanding a discourse in more dimensions . " 35 Throughout his discussion , Ransom showed interest not in the poetry of Robinson , Frost , Robert Bridges , Yeats , or even Hopkins , but in that of Pound , Eliot , Tate , Stevens ? the so-called modernists . In discussing the " indeterminateness " of such writers , he often became vague , speaking , for example , of " indeterminateness of the positive sort . " Further , he referred to modernist poetry as being " an ontological density which proves itself by logical obscurity . " 36 One is lost in a broken-mirror room of paradoxes . Ransom 's pontificating tone and language , however , were part of the story of the New Criticism and its correlative quixotic aesthetic . Stanley Edgar Hyman ( 1919 ? 1970 ) Hyman 's approach to criticism was indicated in his preface to The Armed Vision ( 1947 ) , where he cited a particularly relevant passage from Sir Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible for me to pay much attention to them , for as they do not understand what I call  | poetry , we talk in a foreign language to each other . Indeed , many of these gentlemen appear to me to be a sort of tinkers , who , unable to make pots and pans , set up for menders of them , and , God knows , often make two holes in patching one.37 Hyman defined art as the manipulation of human experience into meaningful and pleasurable patterns . Criticism , he said , is an autelic art . As a kind of poetry , it gives pleasure . This definition of criticism clearly differed from that of Eliot , who declared : " No exponent of criticism . . . has , I presume , ever made the preposterous assumption that criticism is an autelic art . " 38 In a further examination of critical principles , Hyman analyzed Richards 's declaration that aesthetic experiences are " not in the least a new and different kind of thing " and that they can be studied in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyman pointed out , was anticipated by Conrad Aiken and even before him by John Dewey.39 With the penchant for contention characteristic of so many critics , Hyman listed Max Eastman , V. F. Calverton , and Henri Peyre among the bad and infuriating contemporary critics . Peyre , however , should certainly be credited with his recognition of the excitement inherent in creatively used erudition . Precisely because of his mastery in this respect he could see , as Hyman admitted , that Modern criticism is still groping for its method and enthusiastically experimenting with several techniques . It has not yet outgrown the primitive stage in which physics similarly fumbled before Bacon and Descartes , chemistry before Lavoisier , sociology before Auguste Comte , and physiology before Claude Bernard . Hyman charged that , having made the above statement , Peyre went on to make his sharpest attack on precisely those who represented the attempt of criticism to outgrow the primitive stage he described : Richards , William Empson , Kenneth Burke , and R. P. Blackmur.4 ? In his section on Eliot , Hyman pointed out that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical critic who  | uses his historical studies for the sake of literary understanding , " Edmund Wilson saw Eliot as the very type of the unhistorical critic ? one who treated literature as though it existed in a temporal vacuum.41 Quite astutely , Hyman realized that Eliot absorbed his influences so smoothly that he gave the impression of being a primary source . Actually , his work was highly derivative . One need only refer to Pound ( to whom The Waste Land is dedicated ) , Hulme , and Richards ( whose influence Eliot frequently acknowledged ) , not to speak of foreign influences , especially Gourmont.42 Here Hyman raises the question of consistency in a creative artist , such as Eliot , who combined within himself the poet and the critic . As F. O. Matthiessen argued , Eliot 's essay " The Music of Poetry " refuted " the fallacy that there is no harmony between his ' revolutionary ' creative work and his traditionalist ' criticism . " Hyman thought that the Quartets won many over to Matthiessen 's view . Others , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot 's criticism was , " whatever its ostensible subject , a criticism of his own practice " 43 ? we might say , a defense of his own practice . Much of Hyman 's criticism was concerned with the application of various forms of psychology to criticism and literary aesthetics . Like many others , he cited Maud Bodkin 's Archetypal Patterns in Poetry : Psychological Studies of Imagination ( 1934 ) . This work is based on Jung 's theory of archetypes or unconscious primordial images . These " psychic residua of numberless experiences of the same type " were shared by modern man 's primitive ancestors and have been inherited in the structure of the brain . For literary expression , the basic concepts are the collective unconscious and its archetypal patterns . Here Hyman noted E. E. Stoll 's attack on the application of the psychological method to the analysis of literature and the defense it elicited from Bodkin . She argued cogently that we must not dismiss one of our most valuable modern insights ? psychological awareness ? as " an enriched apprehension . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xanadu , Hyman maintained that she was as oblivious as Lowes to the obvious sex symbolism of the caverns and mountains in Kubla Khan. ) 44  | Although the application of psychoanalysis to the study of literature may perhaps go back to Freud 's The Interpretation of Dreams ( 1900 ) , it was not until Freud 's visit to the United States in 1909 that his ideas , with the help of A. A. Brill , gained currency here . In Hyman 's estimation , another important beginning was made in 1912 when Frederick Clarke Prescott applied Freud 's The Interpretation of Dreams ( not yet translated then ) systematically to the interpretation of poetry in the article " Poetry and Dreams " ( 1919 ) . Prescott declared that poetry , like dreams , is the disguised fulfillment of repressed wishes . Freudian mechanisms found in " dream work " are also to be found in " poetic work . " Hyman felt that in Prescott 's The Poetic Mind ( 1922 ) , Freudian psychoanalysis was watered down " to fit a new romantic mysticism and Shelley worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insisting on plural meaning.45 Hyman 's thoughts on Conrad Aiken should be examined in reference to Houston Peterson 's study of Aiken , notably in the remark , " And our minds grow more complex as we contemplate theories of their complexity . " Aiken , like so many of his contemporaries , has been subject to what Peterson called a " mania psychologica . " Quite correctly , Peterson saw in Aiken a romantic who took modern psychology seriously . He attempted " to convert poetry into a kind of absolute music . " In The House of Dust , Aiken wrote : " Let us return , hear music and forget . " In this poem his psychological burrowing can be seen in such lines as Our own brute minds ? in which we hurry , trembling , Through streets as yet unlighted . . . . We are all searchers in a house of darkness , A house of dust ; we creep with little lanterns . . . . But what , one may ask , does this mean aesthetically ? Why should we bring this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if there were only dust ?  | The answer is in the sudden opening of a door and hearing " a sudden music . " The aesthetic quest is precisely for the musical moments in life or time and the nature of one 's identity that seems to beckon , and to escape , from one expression of it to another . So often Aiken set Freud to music ? a music in which the repetitive theme is Festus 's ( that is , Aiken 's ) question : But am I then . . . in a cavern From which I dare not grow ? Into the universe which is myself ? Through such psychological insights ( those gained from Freud and Jung ) Aiken came to understand that a poet-critic 's pronouncements on the work of others really constitute a defense , as Peterson put it , of his own brand of poetry . They represent " a slow distillation of his temperament through his reason . " 46 Hyman showed that Aiken derived his basic attitude of contemporary criticism from Freud . Aiken even anticipated Richards 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that its origins and functions may be open to analysis . Hyman believed , however , that the most penetrating use of psychoanalysis for criticism was made by Kenneth Burke in his " Freud and the Analysis of Poetry . " Burke also drew heavily on gestalt psychology in order to achieve an integrated , " phenomenological " approach . He praised Caroline Spurgeon 's Shakespeare 's Imagery and What It Tells Us ( 1935 ) as one of the three most fertile works in literature since Eliot 's The Sacred Wood , the other two being the volumes of Richards and Empson.47 According to Hyman , Burke 's notion of literature as symbolic action may be traced to Plato 's Republic . Socrates spoke of man 's natural desire to find relief from misfortune in weeping and lamentation . He referred to the poets who delighted in presenting this feeling through controlled expression . For Hyman , however , Aristotle was the true father of symbolic action . In the Poetics Aristotle said that " happiness and misery are not states of being , but forms of activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | symbolic actions . Here Hyman aptly cited D. H. Lawrence 's Freudian remark : " One sheds one 's sickness in books . " 48 Burke 's " dramatism , " in Hyman 's estimation , was derived from Aristotle and perhaps also from Scott Buchanan 's Poetry and Mathematics ( 1929 ) . Burke equated Aristotle 's four causes ? formal , material , efficient , and final ? with act , scene , agent , and purpose . ( " Act , " " scene , " and " agent " are the three terms central to the philosophy of drama embodied in Henry James 's prefaces ) . Burke also equated his categories with Aristotle 's six elements of tragedy : plot as act , character as agent , thought as purpose , melody and diction as agency , and spectacle as scene.4J Burke 's analysis of Freud caused some critics to charge him with the use of " jargon " and has tempted Hyman to indulge himself in a sardonic bon mot . Hyman reflected that Burke received so little of the world 's " increment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " excrement . " J0 Finally , Hyman made noteworthy reference to the divided modern mind , with its many levels of meaning and its concomitant manyleveled criticism . Thus Charles Baudouin ( Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics , 1924 ) spoke of a " multiple parallelism , " comparable to a polyglot Bible ; Richards , of a " multiple definition " or " multiple interpretation " ; Burke , of a " multiple causation " ; Erich Fromm , of a " palimpsest " reading of Kafka in psychoanalytic , social , and religious terms ; Prescott , of " multiple significance " ; Philip Wheelwright , of " plurisignation " ; and Austin Warren , of " concurrent multivalence. " 51 Richard Foster ( 1928 ? ) By 1962 , Richard Foster felt that " a reappraisal of the New Criticism " was in order . He offered such a reappraisal in The New Romantics , with the quoted words serving as a subtitle . Here Foster argued that on close examination of the New Critic 's aesthetics , epistemology , and metaphysics , he emerges as a romantic rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his sensibility rather than by his use of reason.52 Foster paid tribute to Murray Krieger 's The New Apologists for  | Poetry ( 1956 ) , which provided Foster with his own point of departure . He considered his own discussion complementary to Krieger 's . They both viewed the sensibility and criticism of the New Critics as " romantic . " The claim of the New Critics that poetry provided knowledge beyond reason and science was , in Foster 's opinion , tantamount to a metaphysics of revelation.53 For Foster the New Critics . . . are twentieth-century romantics whose sensibilities as romantics overbalance whatever traditionalist viewpoints they may explicitly subscribe to . . . they have tended to oppose poetry to science . . . and . . . like the Romantics , in order to raise that opposition above the level of a merely desperate emotional reaction , they have developed and promoted a supporting theoretical doctrine that poetry is a high form of knowledge.54 Richards himself , in Foster 's interpretation of Coleridge on Imagination ( 1935 ) , shifted from mechanism to vitalism and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed Coleridge would find themselves centered , not in the object but in their awareness of it . We might ask : What then would become of the hallowed " objective correlative " ? This question did not occur to Foster . Coleridge 's notion of the " coincidence of an object with its subject " 55 may be only a partial answer to that question . William Elton ( 1921 ? ) In " A Guide to the New Criticism " ( 1949 ) , 56 Elton stated that while the New Criticism has achieved a singular triumph in being adopted in the college teaching of poetry , " its theories remain impenetrable and misunderstood " and that for this " its terminology is largely to blame . " He therefore attempted to provide a glossary.57 Elton saw the New Criticism as one of a series of critical replies to the chaos of standards between two world wars : the neohumanism of Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt ; the economic determinism  | of Granville Hicks ; and the aesthetic or New Criticism of John Crowe Ransom . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions of critical terms . He simply attempted to clarify the terms current in the New Criticism . In the process he ventured some critical remarks of his own . The student will find in his little guide thumbnail information on such items as Empson 's seven types of ambiguity , and Philip Wheelwright 's remark on Empson 's confusion ; form , irony , and poetry as knowledge ; metaphor , ontology or the reality of being within a poem ; and sensibility , structure , texture , symbol , tension , and wit . Particularly pertinent here are Elton 's definitions of " structure " and " texture . " He culled his definition of structure from Ransom , Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren . Brooks took The Rape of the Lock as an illustration : The structure is not the heroic complex as such , or the canto arrangement . . . or that of the mock-epic convention . .. . It is a structure of meanings , evaluations , and interpretations ; and the principle of unity which informs it seems to be one of balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It unites the like and the unlike . The unity is not one of reduction and simplification . It is an achieved harmony . In such a structure we have " the frequent occurrence .. . of such terms as ambiguity , ' paradox , ' complex of attitudes ' and . Irony . ' " 58 On the question of " texture , " Elton pointed out that Ransom directed attention from the semantic to the psychological ? " the poem as a work on the order of a Freudian dream , having not only a manifest and possible content but a latent and suspected content . " Ransom related the manifest content to the so-called public argument of structure , and the latent content to the free detail of texture . It is not at all clear , however , how in Ransom 's system the thought work becomes the ego 's while the play on substance becomes the id 's . Because Ransom omitted the superego , the third member of the Freudian group , Elton suggested that it operates in the social rela-  | tions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and texture . Later Ransom abandoned Freudian probing.59 The Chicago School and Other Critics Ronald Salmon Crane , a leading member of the so-called Chicago school of critics found two errors ( ultimately , really one ) in the New Criticism : ( I ) It approaches a variety of poems in the same way ; it looks in all of them for one and the same structure ( paradox , irony , complex meaning ) . ( 2 ) It is preoccupied with intellectual content ; it seeks for structure exclusively in terms of thought rather than in anything that may be the distinctive unifier of a given poem . Thus , the New Critic 's reading ? as is the case , for instance , in Cleanth Brooks 's analysis of Gray 's Elegy ? gives us not a poem but a subtle piece of dialectic.U ? Another member of the Chicago Group , sl Elder Olson , offered the following explanation of the emotive basis of art : We feel some emotion , some form of pleasure or pain , because our desires are frustrated or satisfied ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , or favour or do not favour the characters set before us . . . and we are friendly or hostile to the characters because of their ethical traits ; in brief , we side with the good against the bad or . . . with the oppressed against the oppressor . To speak this way , John Holloway commented , is to speak of those who boo the stage villain or cheer the hero.62 In his article " The Aesthetics of Textual Criticism " James Thorpe raised the interesting question of whether printers ' errors are unwitting improvements on an author 's version of his work and whether editorial emendations are real improvements on the original text . Paul Valery declared that " once published , a text is like an apparatus that anyone may use as he will . " Besides , if an author " knows well what he meant to do , this knowledge always disturbs his perception of what he has done . " Thorpe commented : " We may be suspicious  | of anything that can be called authorial intention , for fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main points made by Thorpe was that " the intentions of the person we call the author . . . become entangled with the intentions of all the others printers , editors , commentators who have a stake in the outcome , which is the work of art . " 64 Because of this entanglement , the work of art is " always tending toward a collaborative status . " No ultimate authority for the textual critic was claimed by Thorpe . He simply made a plea for a consistent set of aesthetic assumptions in terms of which the textual critic could recover and preserve the integrity of the text.65 The problem of " intention " engaged the attention of T. M. Gang , who accepted William R. Wimsatt 's and Monroe C. Beardsley 's position that criticism should concern itself with the poem " objectively " rather than with the mental processes that engendered it , or those that it produces.66 For all that , Gang was not willing to ignore all information about the author or the historical context of the poem . For Gang , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of intending and that of signifying . When we ask what the poet meant , we are asking what he intended to signify . It is probably better , Gang said , to talk about the meaning of King Lear than about Shakespeare 's intention in writing the play . Where external data ( notebooks , prefaces , letters ) contribute to our construction , the author 's literary intention will be worth invoking.67 The concept of " subconscious intention " should be considered , Gang felt , because the unconscious is invoked not merely in conjunction with the neurotic but with the discoverable source of all behavior and of all art . Images and patterns are present in the unconscious quite apart from the artist 's awareness . The " unconscious meaning " of a symbol , said Gang , is like the dictionary meaning of a word : we can look up our book of archetypal patterns to find out what it is . Gang 's final conclusion is that we need not be afraid of the word " intention " and that even while using it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intentional fallacy , the New Critics , in their struggle to establish the autonomy of the individual work of art ,  | combated the so-called biographical fallacy . Rene Wellek declared categorically in 1949 , as Carlos Baker pointed out , that " No biographical evidence can change or influence critical evaluation . " The following year , however , Leslie Fiedler counterattacked this as " a central dogma of much recent criticism . " With good humor , Baker related that in the 1940s " all a man needed to set himself up as Pontifex Maximus Scriblerus was wit , sensibility , imagination , a gift of gab , his bare hands ? and a poem or a story to analyze the hell out of . " In the late 196os critics were no longer as cocksure as they had been in the 19405 about the irrelevance of history and biography in the effort to plumb or assess the products of the creative act . Had not an outstanding poet like Wallace Stevens declared before this ? and Baker quoted these words : It is often said of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subterfuge . It can not be otherwise . . . . The truth is . . . that a man 's sense of the world dictates his subjects to him and his sense is derived from his . . . temperament ... over which he has little control ... . Baker himself reported that as a result of reading the letters of Stevens and Lawrance Thompson 's biography of Frost , his understanding of these poets was deepened . His concluding remark , then , was that sensible critics will find relevance in biographical and historical material for a full understanding of poetry and literary products.69 Twelve years earlier , in writing a report for English readers on the state of criticism in America , Wimsatt struck a pessimistic note : as usual , and perhaps necessarily , criticism is in a state of confusion and mess . " Because of underlying difficulties , his prognostication was that criticism was " likely now and in the future to renew and sustain the confusion . " 70 One student of art and its history , Patricia Gebhard , has found the aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the syntax and structure of the various arts . In defining a poem as the organization of man 's experiences into an autonomous whole , the New Criticism presented the possibility of evaluating  | the other arts in terms of the same type of organic whole . When used thus , the New Criticism becomes an aesthetic theory that can aid in the understanding and enjoyment of all the arts.7 ' Although the aesthetic of the New Criticism has never been definitively defined , certain principles do emerge . Historically , it goes back to Plato and Aristotle and forward to Kant and Coleridge . In England , the chief proponent of what was to be named the New Criticism by Ransom was Richards , who was heavily indebted to Coleridge . The more immediate sources of New Criticism as it developed in America were Remy de Gourmont and Hulme . Its central idea was that a work of art ( especially a poem ) is an organic , autonomous whole .  | THE MODALITIES AND DIALECTICS OF POESIS In the periodic shifting of values , literary aesthetics has undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the structure of language and the relationship of poetry to cognition . This chapter deals with two sophisticated observers of literaryaesthetic ideas , particularly during the second two decades of our century ? John Livingston Lowes ( 1867 ? 1945 ) and Max Eastman ( 1883 ? 1969 ) ? and two poets who reacted critically to their craft ? Robert Frost ( 1874 ? 1963 ) and Wallace Stevens ( 1879 ? 1955 ) . CONVENTION AND REVOLT : LOWES AND EASTMAN The theme of Lowes 's Convention and Revolt in Poetry ( 1919 ) was permanence in flux . For him , convention entailed concurrence with certain accepted methods of communication as well as the acceptance of illusion ( depth in a painting , time in a play ) . In both Wordsworth and Henri Amiel he found support for the idea that the poet 's truth depends not on actuality but on illusion : " The very essence of poetic truth is accepted illusion and illusion to which we consent is the very tap root of conventions of poetry . " 1  | In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through a balance between recurrence and variation , convention often comes to life again . Thus , as Lowes indicated , a revival of the ubi sent formula ( " Where , oh where are ? " ) occurred in Edgar Lee Masters 's Spoon River Anthology : Where are Elmer , Herman , Bert ... ? Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily . . . ? All , all , are sleeping on the hill.2 Admitting that the old could not be transformed forever , Lowes pointed to the irony that the new stays so only for a fleeting moment , as it were , and that the striving for newness often results in the display of devious tricks . He believed , further , that at its height the finest art would not only transcend but transmute the public taste.3 The relative roles of denotation and connotation were brought into the argument concerning the differentia of poetry and prose . Suggestions and connotations of words , Lowes maintained , are the very elements of poetry ; a contrary situation prevails in scientific prose : For words stir our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but through their enveloping atmosphere of associations italics added . . . . Not one word in a poem produces its effect through what a dictionary can afford . As an example , he cited a passage from Robert Louis Stevenson 's " Requiem " : Home is the sailor , home from the sea , And the hunter home from the hill . ... 4 In this passage practically each word , although common enough , is , in the poetic context , richly freighted with an association of ideas . Because of this association , which Lowes did not express , the words have the power to waken within the reader that wistfulness , that metaphysical shiver , which evokes a darkly lyrical atmosphere . The shift of values becomes evident in comparison with the romantic belief that words had intrinsic poetic values , which , according to  | Lowes , " conferred plenary absolution from the pains of thought upon poet and reader alike . " Such a doctrine later provoked a reaction in the form of the so-called New Poetry , especially among the imagists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true master be revealed through Beschrankung ( restraint ) , and Theophile Gautier challenged poets to look down " on facile measure " : Sculpte , lime , cisele ; Que ton rave flottant se scelle Dans le bloc resistant ! These lines were translated by Santayana : Chisel and carve and file , Till thy vague dream imprint Its smile On the unyielding flint.5 Lowes , however , in his discussion of the " plenary absolution " of the romanticists from difficult workmanship , must have known better than most that Shelley and Keats , to mention only two romantic poets , often slaved over their poems , as their manuscripts reveal . On the relative uses of thought and feeling in poetry , Lowes regarded poetry that embodied thought alone as prose disguised as verse : " But however feeling may render plastic the stuff of poetry , the poem , if it be worthy of the name , is forged in the brain . " Looking at " the ruck of recent verse " in the monthly periodicals of his day , he found creative imagination utterly absent.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowes 's Convention and Revolt in Poetry fundamentally unsound in its disregard of psychology and the logic of science . Rejecting Lowes 's dictum that the very essence of poetic truth is accepted illusion , Eastman did not believe with Shelley and Wordsworth that poetry is the breath and finer spirit of science , although he did think that it can breathe a fine spirit into knowledge or science . In his remark that poetry can not  | be the criticism of life but can be the life of criticism , he did not clearly indicate whether he meant that poetry can make criticism lively or that criticism can itself be a form of poetry . Like many earlier critics , he understood that in such writers as Goethe , Taine , and William James , poetry and science approached each other , if they did not indeed merge . James , wrote Eastman , was in fact " a great psychologist with poetry in his pen . " 7 IN PURSUIT OF POETIC IMAGINATION The response to Lowes 's The Road to Xanadu : A Study in the Ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , described it as " a major study in the operations of the poetic imagination , " praising it further as a work in which " even the pursuit of sources becomes a critical activity . " 8 In such a study Lowes of course dealt with Coleridge 's distinction between fancy and imagination ? a distinction recently supported by Kenneth Burke . Lowes arrived at the conviction that these factors are not two powers but one : " The valid distinction which exists between them lies , not in the materials with which they operate , but in the degree of intensity of the operant power itself . " In this opinion he was sustained years later by Lascelles Abercrombie , who declared outright that fancy was nothing but a degree of imagination and that " the degree of it concerns , not the quality of the imagery , but the quality and force of the emotion symbolized by the imagery . " 9 With great ingenuity and unflinching effort , Lowes traced Coleridge 's imaginative process from a small manuscript notebook found at the British Museum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ancient Mariner " and " Kubla Khan . " Indeed , an examination of this notebook prompted Lowes to follow Coleridge through his numerous primary and secondary sources.10 In this search he may have been aided by Coleridge 's revelation , in Anima Poetae , of the secret sources of both " Kubla Khan " and " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner " : " . . . the imagination ? the true inward creatrix , instantly  | out of the chaos of elements or shattered fragments of memory , puts together some form to fit it . " Lowes hesitated to use the term " unconscious , " resorting to Coleridge 's suggestion of the twilight realms of consciousness.12 To support Coleridge 's views on the origins and operations of poetic creativity , Lowes cited a modern instance bearing the authority of a scientist , Henri Poincare 's Science and Method . In this work Poincare maintained that the unconscious work of the imagination actually involves laborious preparation , and that the sudden illumination of the mind , after prolonged periods of unconscious work , remains mysterious , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future elements of our combinations as something resembling Epicurus 's hooked atoms atomes crochus . When the mind is in complete repose these atoms are immovable . . . . Thus complete repose may continue indefinitely without the atoms meeting . . . without the possibility of the formation of any combination . . . . On the other hand , during a period of apparent repose , but of unconscious work , some of them are detached from the wall . . . and set in motion . ... Their mutual collisions may then produce new combinations . . . . We then have unexpected coupling.l " Lowes also cited Dryden 's description of fancy : " in its first Work initial stage , moving the sleeping Images of things towards the Light , there to be distinguished , and then either chosen or rejected by the Judgment . " 14 Finally , Lowes offered Coleridge 's own concise definition : " the streaming nature of association which thinking curbs and rudders. " 15 Lowes understood that poetic creativity will always involve " something inscrutable which no analysis can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas ? his combination of atomes crochus. ' s On the role of psychoanalysis in such a study , Lowes stated categorically that he was dealing only with the material content of the dream , not at all with the latent . ' ? His dubious description of the dreamer as merely a detached and unsolicitous spectator was subsequently corrected :  | The sole factor that determined the form and sequence of the dissolving phantasmagoria in " Kubla Khan " was the subtle potency of the associative links . There was this time no intervention of a waking intelligence intent upon a plan . . . and it is largely that absence of deliberate manipulation which has made it possible to disengage , to a degree unattainable in our study of " The Ancient Mariner , " the bewildering hooks and eyes of the memory which were the irresponsible artificers of the dream.18 In Coleridge 's previously quoted description of the imagination , Lowes found the ultimate statement of the poet 's views on form and dream.19 One of the pervasive questions in literary aesthetics involves the role of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romance of the mind , a phrase used by Henry Osborn Taylor as the title of his book ( devoted to his humanistic approach to science . In the measurement of civilization various types of facts have to be taken into account : the material , the intellectual , the moral , the political , and the aesthetic . Although the idea of number ( measurement ) has been applied in varying degrees to all of them , the first is the most susceptible to measurements , while the last can be measured only with difficulty , if at all.2o To what extent does fact of the material kind play a role in the creative imagination ? Lowes stated forthrightly that the notion that the creative imagination has little or nothing to do with the facts " is one of the pseudodoxia epidemica which die hard . . . . For the imagination never operates in a vacuum . Its stuff is always fact of some order , somehow experienced ; its product is that fact transmuted . " 21 The artist , of course , must prevent facts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whom a theory is a scientific poem , and science itself , as Gaston Bachelard noted , the aesthetic of intellect . With Coleridge , certainly , the mind was not merely " a lazy looker-on on an external world , " 22 but a force actively concerned with the unity of mind and the object of its contemplation . The maintenance of such a view of the mind is the essential problem of aesthetics .  | IMAGISM In 1931 , when Glenn Hughes published his Imagism and Imagists , the movement was still alive , although it had ceased to be the center of critical controversy . Hughes discussed six " official " representatives of the period : Richard Aldington , H. D. ( Hilda Doolittle ) , John Gould Fletcher , F. S. Flint , D. H. Lawrence , and Amy Lowell . He added the name of Ezra Pound " because of his importance to the movement as an organizer . " 23 Pound invented the term imagism24 and described the four basic principles of the movement : ( 1 ) direct treatment of matters subjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words , ( 3 ) composition " in sequence of the musical phrase , not the sequence of a metronome , " and ( 4 ) conformity to the doctrine of the image . Pound defined the image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time . " He added that " it is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce a voluminous work . " 25 The principles of imagism were further defined by Aldington and Lowe11Y6 as essentially those of all great literature : the use of the common , exact , rather than the decorative word ; the creation of new cadences that carry new ideas ; freedom in choice of subject ; the presentation of exact images that avoid the vague and the " cosmic " ; and a general adherence to modern life , with , however , a rejection of certain of its uninspiring elements.27 Lowell was particularly concerned with the problems of vers Libre , which she called " cadenced verse " : It is the sense of perfect balance of flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the foot , the number of syllables , the quantity , or the line . The unit is the strophe , which may be the whole poem , or may be only a part . Each strophe is a complete circle . . . . The circle need not always be the same size , nor need the times allowed to negotiate it always be the same . . . . Also circles can be added to circles , movement upon  | movement to the poem , provided each movement completes itself , and ramifies naturally into the next.28 She used " H.D. " ' s " Oread " as an example : Whirl up , sea Whirl your pointed pines , Splash your great pines On our rocks , Hurl your green over us , Cover us with your pools of fir . In this poem each line is a cadence composed of time units in which the number of syllables is immaterial and which are to be read at varying tempi.29 Reactions to Imagism Conrad Aiken , one of the most vocal adversaries of imagism , charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked emotional force and were therefore unable to stir the reader , and that , except for Fletcher , they were all " music deaf . " 3 ? Another adversary , William Ellery Leonard , declared that the imagists could not see straight , feel straight , think straight , or talk straight.31 As an example , he quoted Amy Lowell 's " Bullion " : My thoughts Chink against my ribs And roll about like silver hailstones I should like to spill them out . Leonard 's comment to this was : " Dear lady , I wish you might ; you would feel easier . " 32 He continued : " Their words do n't spring to life , as wisdom from power . . . . They are sought for , hunted out , not prayed for , waited for .... " His final estimate was that the imagists were guilty of quackery 33 Yet another critical response to imagism , and again particularly  | to the poems of Amy Lowell , came from John Livingston Lowes himself . He restated in crystallized form the imagist credo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; precision of delineation linked with flexibility of rhythm . " Then , stimulated by Witter Bynner 's remark that " George Meredith has thousands of imagist poems incidental to each of his novels , " Lowes printed as prose three passages from Lowell 's vers libre poems , concluding that " Miss Lowell 's free verse may be written as very beautiful prose ; George Meredith 's prose may be written as very beautiful free verse . Which is which ? " Lowell 's own answer was , " There is no difference . " She added that typography is irrelevant and that a comparison of Meredith 's lyrical passages from his prose with his own metrical poetry would reveal the advantages his imagination enjoyed in using freer forms.34 And so the battle continued . In 3917 , T. S. Eliot declared emphatically that vers libre did not exist , that it was simply " a battle-cry of freedom in art , " that " the ghost of some simple meter should lurk behind the arras in even the freest verse , ' " and that " freedom is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial limitation . " 35 The idea , said Hughes , that cadence should be substituted for meter , and that the result could be distinguished from prose , was at the very heart of the imagist credo ss John Gould Fletcher argued that the basis of English poetry was " rhythm , or , as some would call it , cadence . " Using geometric metaphors to represent the difference between prose and poetry , he envisiond thought and emotion as expressed in prose , developing in a straight line , from the point of view of a flat surface . Breadth is secured by the grouping of sentences in a paragraph ; the sensation of depth is obtained by the arrangement of blocks of thought " in a rising climacteric progression , or in parallel lines , or in a sort of zigzag figure . " In poetry , on the other hand , ... we have a succession of curves . The direction of thought is not in straight lines , but wavy and spiral . It rises and falls on gusts of strong emotion . Most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stanza or strophe  | always tends to be spherical . Depth is obtained by making one sphere contain a number of concentric or overlapping spheres . Fletcher concluded that the difference between poetry and prose is " a difference between a general roundness and a general squareness of outline . " 37 Fletcher 's geometrical analogies also suggest a difference between the maleness of prose and the femaleness of poetry and a bisexuality in cases where poetry has an admixture of prose and where prose contains poetry . These discussions of free verse were illustrated by Eastman 's ingenious juxtaposition of two passages : ( A ) Any space is not quiet it is so likely to be shining . Darkness very dark darkness is sectional . There is a way to see in onion and surely very surely rhubarb and a tomato , surely very surely there is that seeding . ( B ) I was looking at you , the sweet boy that does not want sweet soap . Neatness of feet do not win feet , but feet win the neatness of men . Run does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strawberries best . Eastman took one of these passages from Kraepelin 's Clinical Psychiatry and the other from a work by Gertrude Stein . Now which is which ? Passage A is by Stein , whom Edith Sitwell credited with revivifying the language through her very anarchy.38 Thus the cult of unintelligibility seems to attempt everything from the annihilation of syntax to typographical peculiarities . To what end ? The work of Robert Frost may suggest an answer . TWO POETS AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS Robert Frost ( 1874 ? 1963 ) Ezra Pound , who met Frost in London in 1912 , found that New Englander to be a birch that could not be bent " down to stay " ( " Birches " ) . No , Pound could not make an imagist disciple of him .  | Everything Frost took ? or took to ? he made conform to his own style . Many of the forces that affected Frost 's early development are explained in Lawrance Thompson 's three-volume biography , 39 which describes Frost 's early exposure to Swedenborgian symbolism and correspondences ; to Wordsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother he learned to appreciate Poe . He read Cooper , Francis Parkman , William Hickling Prescott , Thomas Gray , and Sir Walter Scott . He was impressed by the death poems of Edward Rowland Sill and was even more fascinated by the somber wit and terse statements in Emily Dickinson 's poems . With Elinor ( his future wife ) he read Shelley , and while working in the Arlington Mill , he read Shakespeare and Thomas Hardy , who taught him " the good use of a few words . " Frost also read Keats , Tennyson , and Browning and he was moved by Francis Thompson 's " The Hound of Heaven . " In his reading of Virgil , as Lawrance Thompson noted , Frost became aware of the entire range of pastoral poetry , while the Iliad and the Odyssey made him familiar with the scope of epic art . " At Harvard , Frost felt the influence of William James ( then on leave ) .41 Half a century later , when I asked Frost whether he " had " George Santayana , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " Yes , he had me . " Frost 's early humanistic interest in astronomy was deepened by his reading of Richard Proctor 's Our Place among Infinities ( 1876 ) , while his interest in earth science was aroused by Nathaniel Southgate Shaler 's course in historical geology . Thompson suggested that historical geology interacted with Frost 's interest in astronomy , furnishing many metaphors and images that were subsequently incorporated in his poems.42 Writing about Nathaniel S. Shaler , William James remarked , " Of all the minds I have known , his leaves the largest impression , " and he described Shaler 's From Old Fields as " a great epic wind of sadness blowing through it all . " 43 Whether or not young Frost read that volume of poems on the Civil War , its " touch of Thomas Hardy 's feeling for fate " must have emerged in Shaler 's lectures , particularly impressing the young Frost . Certainly , this " touch " is evident in Frost 's " A Question " :  | A voice said , Look in the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the soul-and-body scars Were not too much to pay for birth.44 Here the influence of Schopenhauer has joined that of Proctor , Shaler , and Hardy . Frost appreciated Walden as being " near the height of poetry . " And Emerson 's essays and poems expressed for him " the rapture of idealism . " As a teacher at Pinkerton , he read with his classes Longfellow 's " Evangeline " and " The Courtship of Miles Standish , " Hawthorne 's The House of the Seven Gables and Maeterlinck 's Blue Bird.45 The influence of Hawthorne was particularly strong , and Frost must have been moved by such passages as the following : The northwest wind has swept the sky clear . The window is distinctly seen . Through its panes , moreover , we dimly catch the sweep of the dark , clustering foliage , outside , fluttering with a constant irregularity of movement , and letting in a peep of starlight . . . . These glimpses illuminate the Judge 's face . . . . The moonbeams fall aslant into the room . They play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stirred throughout the hours of darkness . . . . They gleam upon his watch . His grasp conceals the dial-plate ; but we know that the faithful hands have met ; for one of the city clocks tells midnight 4s This poetic amalgam of the elements of nature , of the dramatic dialectic of light and darkness , of man 's loneliness , and of death reappeared throughout Frost 's poetry . In " I Will Sing You One-O , " for example , the wind and the cold suggest a fear that they " Had checked the pace/Of the tower clock , " recalling Hawthorne 's " one of the city clocks telling midnight . " Here and elsewhere Frost and Hawthorne showed a common companionship with the night and with the dramatization of " finalities . " French literature also had its impact on Frost , although not to the same extent as on Stevens . At the State Normal School in Plymouth , New Hampshire , Frost had his students read Rousseau 's Emile . In           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
