txt YESTERDAY , TONY ANDERSON should have been getting out of the city ? bumping along on a bus heading north . He should have been singing songs along with the other boys , giggling and switching seats , looking out the window as the apartments and warehouses of the city leveled off into suburban shopping malls and then faded into farmland , eventually succumbing into cool , shaded woods . Yesterday , Tony Anderson should have left for Boy Scout camp where life is a lot different than it is on 95th Street . Where night noises are not cars backfiring , or guns going off or shrieks from a fight going on down the street . BUT RATHER , the whispered ghost stories from the kid on the top bunk and the rustle of a raccoon near the tent and the rhythmic sound of all those bugs out there in the dark . He certainly was planning to go . He 'd been excited for weeks . He was going to go with his younger brother , Nat , who Is 11 ? just one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a 12-year-old could to earn some extra money before he got on that Boy Scout bus . LAST TUESDAY , he and his buddies took some paper bags and headed up toward 87th Street  --  to the yards of some friendly people who raise fruit trees and grape vines and often let the kids pick enough to eat . " I told him he could go , " said his mother , Jessie , " but then he was supposed to come right home . I 'm always to know where he is . " After the boys got through picking , they stopped at the shopping center on the 87th Street and went to the Jewel . They often did that too , to earn some // Close-up With Anne Keegan will wtll never see scout camp // money . They would help people carry their shopping bags to thelr'cars . But the afternoon was half over and after an hour , Tony headed for home . AS HE CROSSED the parking lot . something captured his eye . It was a carnival that had just arrived . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpacking as he walked . lie was by himself and heading toward 95111 Street when a man in the carnival called out to hirn ' and asked if he wanted to make sonic money . Ile worked two hours unloading stuffed animals they give away for prizes . But then it got to be 3 p.m. , dinnertime at his row house at 248 W. 95th St. , and Tony knew he 'd better get home fast . Ile was happy . He had three dollars wadded up in his fist . " WHEN HE got home I gave him a whopping , " his mother said . " He was late and he had n't told me where he was . The rule with all my four boys is to let me know . " Ile sat down to eat supper and I sat with him . Pretty soon he told he 'd made three dollars working in the carnival and he asked me if he could go back and work the next day . lie said the man wanted him there at 9 a.m . " I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any carnival . ' Then he told me he wanted to go so bad because then lie could buy his grandmother a birthday present and he would n't be able to earn some money for a while because of camp . So God forbid , I said yes . " THE ' NEXT DAY , Tony was the first one up in his house . He ate his breakfast before 8 o'clock and reported to work at the carnival by nine . Just after four o'clock , Mrs. Anderson was in the kitchen preparing supper when one of Tony 's friends burst in . He 'd just come from the carnival and lie was crying . " Mrs. Anderson , Mrs. Anderson , " he Tony Anderson screamed . " Tony 's been shot and he 's bleeding from the mouth . " Mrs. Anderson ran to a neighbor ? Mrs. Zorali Briggs  --  and together they climbed into the Briggs ' car . " SIZE WAS moving so fast , " Mrs. Briggs said , " that I never got to put on My shoes . We drove to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We saw a body lying there on the asphalt under a piece of canvas . Jessie just ran up and ripped that canvas off and there was Tony . " Some men in the crowd pulled Mrs. Anderson back . They put the canvas back over Tony 's body and made her get away . " They told me he was already dead , " Mrs. Anderson said . " All I wanted to do was to see him one last time , to touch him . I could see one tennis shoe sticking out and his little hand , There was a pool of blood next to him and it looked to me like he was still bleeding . But they kept telling me he was already dead . " Mrs. Anderson stood there looking at her son 's body lying between two yellow parking lines . She was crying and mumbling to herself , " I almost did n't let hIm ? come . I almost did n't let Tony come here today . " WHILE SIZE stood there , police were searching for the weapon that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a 22-caliber itohm  --  a " Saturday night special . " Edwin Sanchez , 17 , too young to even legally buy a gun , was the owner . Ile told police lie worked at the carnival and that he had the gun for security , even though there were special security , guards posted all around the carnival . Ile was charged with involuntary manslaughter . Sanchez told police that he had given the gun to a 10-year-old while he took a nap . But the 16-year-old tired of it and put it back in the trailer . When Sanchez woke up , he told police , he went in to get the gun . He pulled the trigger once to check it and it did n't go off . Then somehow , in some still unexplanted way , the gun did go off . AND TONY ANDERSON was in the bullet 's way . The bullet hit him once , in the heart . Tony  --  the kid who wanted to buy something for his grandma  --  fell back onto the pavement  --  dead . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bunk , exhausted from play , relaxed from all the excitement , but lying awake thinking of what wonders the first day at camp would bring . But last night , Tony lay stretched out at a South Side funeral home  --  still and lifeless  --  prepared for burial . TONY ANDERSON should have gotten to go to Boy Scout camp . But someone near him had a " Saturday night special , " so Tony Anderson never lived past Wednesday . And he never got on that bus .
