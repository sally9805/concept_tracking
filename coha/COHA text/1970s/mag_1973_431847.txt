 | The Right Diet for You EVERY DIET promises to be the quick and painless way to lose weight . And each recommends a different route . Small wonder if by now you 've decided that there is n't any diet that is right for you . But there is . Best of all , it is one that fits your life , and it works ! The most important part of any diet is " you . " You must be able to live your normal life with it . You have to be able to stay with it comfortably so you can take weight off and keep it off . This means that the diet has to keep you nourished with food you like , and let you eat that food on a schedule that suits you . If this sounds like a personalized , tailor-made diet , you are right . If you think this diet will be hard to locate or expensive , you are wrong . You begin the diet the way a tailor starts on a suit ? with the taking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three questions : What kind of person am I ? What kinds of foods do I like ? What kind of life do I lead ? Under Kind of Person I Am jot down characteristics that will affect your dieting . Are you determined ? Well-disciplined ? Or have past tries at dieting suggested that you ? like most of us ? are self-indulgent or easily discouraged ? Play fair . There 's no point in describing a paragon and then being disappointed when plain old you sneaks a piece of cake . If the cake-sneaking sounds all too likely , figure out the times when you are most apt to give in to temptation . Do you stick to a diet when you 're alone ? Or maybe with you ,  | it 's when you 're with people . Do you nibble while you read or watch television ? Are you a bedtime snacker ? Tell the truth . Under the same heading write down how much weight you want to lose , what your goal is . Be realistic . If you 're a short , stocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons , no diet will make you tall and slender . Success for you is being the most attractive you . Now move to Kinds of Foods I Like . Divide this list into four parts : 1 ) meats , fish and poultry ; 2 ) dairy products ; 3 ) fruits and vegetables ; 4 ) potatoes , cereals and all things made of flour . Nutritionists call these the basic four food groups ? the kinds of food we must have to stay healthy and to feel well fed . They feel a good daily rule is two helpings of meat , fish , poultry or allied proteins ( like dried peas or beans or nuts ) ; two helpings of fruit and two of vegetables ; two helpings of milk or milk-based foods ? cheese , for instance ; four helpings of potatoes or enriched cereals or cereal-based foods ? bread , pancakes , spaghetti , anything like that . List your favorites in all four groups . If too many items fall into the rich-and-gooey , super-fattening class , think a little and list plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kind of Life I Lead . What is your daily pattern ? Your weekend activities ? Note meals you eat away from home . Think back over the past few days and jot down all the times you ate or drank anything . For example , do you take a coffee break every morning at ten ? What about the cocktail or two before dinner and after-dinner drinks ? Keep in mind that you 're chiefly concerned with your schedule as it affects your food intake and your need for energy . If you take in more food calories than you spend , you 'll gain weight . If you take in fewer than you spend , you 'll lose weight ? because you will use up calories from your stored body fat . Most adult women need 2000-2200 calories a day ; men need 2200-2600 . But an adult who wants to lose weight steadily should limit himself to 1200-1400 calories a day . A person who is more active or willing to lose weight more slowly can take in a bit more . Consult your Kind of Person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , how rapidly you want to lose weight and how determined you are . Then settle on the number of calories you are going to give yourself each day . Now get in mind the jigsaw pieces you are going to work with to build your diet picture : 1 . The calorie content of the foods you like . You already have a list divided into the basic four food groups . Buy a pocket-size calorie chart , and learn their calorie content . 2 . The number of helpings of the basic four you are going to include each day . Your calorie chart figures helpings in terms of so many ounces of food or so much of a cupful . Train your eye to be your measuring de- vice . Weigh four ounces of cooked meat or fish , measure out a cup of spinach or peas , a half-cup of cooked rice or cereal . Then put the food on a plate , take a good look at it , and remember . 3 . Your own eating pattern . Go over your Kind of Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and night when you are used to eating or drinking something . Note what you 've been having at each time ? a meal , a snack , a drink or sweet . Put a check mark beside the times which are most important . Now fill in the schedule . Select foods you like and check to make sure you 've included the proper helpings . Portion size is critical ! Write down meals and snacks for one ideal day . Include everything ? the cream in your coffee , the icing on the cake , the works . Next , add up all the calories . Do n't be surprised because the total is considerably higher than the 1400 or so you were aiming at . This sample menu tells you not where you are going , but where you have been . Trimming down your over-caloried menu is n't too hard when you stick to the eating schedule you are used to . For most , the hardest thing about dieting is being locked into a **36;1134;TOOLONG routine . On a tailor-made diet , the snack times continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind or amount of snack food . For instance , look at the calories of the snacks of your ideal menu . What did you have ? Apple pie ? 330 calories . A small candy bar ? 155 . A bedtime sandwich and a glass of milk ? 61o . Can snacks like this stay ? Certainly not all of them . You 're planning a diet , not a miracle . If your Kind of Person list says that you are self-indulgent and must have a daily piece of pie or a cocktail or two , go right ahead . You will have , of course , that many fewer calories to spread over the rest of the day ? but it 's your day ; they are your calories . However , there are many ways to snack without overspending calories . Wheat Thins , for example , are only nine calories each . Animal crackers are 12 . Raw fruits and vegetables make good snacks . A peach is only 35 calories . There are low-calorie diet candies and artificially sweetened diet drinks that count very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snacks , shift them over to that ideal menu . Even without snacks , the three meals a day probably cost too many calories to fit your diet . Or maybe they are costing calories you 'd rather spend for special treats ? a weekend party or a fudge sundae to celebrate the loss of the first five pounds ! This sort of reward is something every dieter should occasionally permit himself . After you 've had a small splurge , you 'll be content to count calories again . Trim your meals by selecting calorie bargains from among the things you like . The more bargains you can include , the more food you can have . For example , consider at breakfast  | time a slice of melon at 35 calories , rather than a glass of orange juice at 90 . Or why not have a poached egg at 75 calories , instead of a scrambled one at rro ? And save the Danish pastry for a snack later on ? maybe for two snacks , with half each time . At noon , you can have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll and a fruit salad with cottage cheese as with , say , a hot roast-beef sandwich . You 'll save 200 calories . If you build dinner around broiled chicken instead of chicken a la king , you 're too calories ahead . And if you select baked fish rather than pork chops , you 've saved a walloping 350 ! And so it goes . By building meals around calorie bargains , giving yourself rewards and sticking to a schedule you like , you can complete the tailoring of the diet you really need . The most workable way is to plan menus a week at a time , keeping your activities in mind . Do you bowl every Thursday and wind up the evening with your teammates over hamburger and beer ? Put it down and work the rest of Thursday around it . Trim a little off the rest of the week to pay for dinner out on Saturday . Your life determines the diet , not the diet your life . Plan it to suit you , and it will serve you well . Following any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not easy . Here are some hints . At the begin ning , omit salt . With unsalted food . you do n't want so much . Eat slowly , preferably with someone , so you 'll have conversation ? something to oc cupy your mind ? besides the eating . If you must eat alone , read or listen to music when you can . Keep your meals small , so you can allow your self a lot of extra nibbling . Serve meals on smaller plates ; they 'll look larger and keep you happier . A great deal of overeating is done out of boredom . Do n't let yourself be bored . The start of a diet is a good time to begin an activity : get the garden in shape , or paint a room . When your hands are busy ? and dirty ? you 're not as apt to want food . And the extra activity burns up calories . Finally , weigh yourself only once a week . You 'll have lost enough weight to feel successfuland nothing succeeds like success ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will also be eating your way to better health . And since thin people live longer than fat ones , you 'll be able to look forward to more time with everything you enjoy . It 's a big payoff. @#
