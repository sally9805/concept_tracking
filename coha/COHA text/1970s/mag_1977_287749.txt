I was riding down the freeway when I heard on the radio that this little place I 'd never heard of was for sale , and the Lord made it known to me that this is where we should go and do his work . The " little place " that the Rev. <P> Alvin Stevens heard about was the entire town of Bridgeville , Calif. , all 80 acres and 25 buildings of it . <P> Stevens sped 330 miles north of San Francisco for a look and immediately fell in love with the region , its mist-shrouded forests and trout-filled streams . This would be an ideal spot to raise families , Stevens decided , and to care for the elderly poor , who " live worse than hogs many places . " The price for Bridgeville was $450,000 , with $150,000 down . Drawls Stevens : " It could have been $1,000 . We did n't have the money . " <P> A Mess . Stevens , 48 , a onetime construction worker from Oklahoma , took his dream to the folk at Stonybrook Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had scraped together . After a prayer meeting , five of the 70-odd parishioners agreed to sell their houses to make up half the down payment . The other half is due in August ; then come stiff monthly payments . <P> Last week 48 church members arrived at their newly bought Eden-and found , as often happens with Edens , that the place was a mess . The town had started as a stagecoach stop , reached a peak population of 300 in 1939 when logging companies were cutting near by , but slumped to 100 by the time a wealthy Los Angeles widow named Elizabeth Lapple bought the place in 1973 . She wanted it as a commune for her hippie children and their hangers-on . As the former residents moved out , marijuana began to sprout in the yards and rock music echoed through the forests . Within a few years , Bridgeville had turned into a rural slum in the middle of God 's country . Wrecked cars now lie forlornly about . The main water system and septic tanks are broken , as are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This used to be a great , far-out place , lots of parties and no hassle , " said Rabbit , one of the final dozen hippies who last week evacuated their grimy quonset hut on the edge of town . He added : " I do n't see how the ole reverend is goin ' to make it . " <P> The reverend is not sure either . He eschews government aid , and is begging money from every friend made in 22 years of preaching , for he believes that " some way God will provide . " The parishioners , who set up a three-member town board , have the skills to rebuild the place , he explains . A store and restaurant will raise capital . The refurbished Country Cafe is already open , complete with no-smoking signs , five paintings of Jesus , and delicious homemade pies . Martha Morris , 27 , cleaning up heaps of reeking garbage at her new home , knows that her husband has no job and unemployment is high in the area , but she believes that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " <P> <P> The old stagecoach barn is to become the church , but at the moment it is rafter high with refuse . So last week 's inaugural service had to be held in the general store , which is full of abandoned electrical equipment . The new settlers , accompanied by banjo , piano and two guitars , belted out a new hymn for the occasion , written to the tune of Okie from Muskogee : <P> I 'm proud to be a Christian in <P> Bridgeville , A place where repentant sinners
