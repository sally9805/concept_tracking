txt The Justice Department charged the Finance Committee to Re-elect the President today with failing to report and maintain records on a $200,000 campaign contribution by Robert L. Vesco , a New Jersey financier . The charges , contained in a three-count information filed in United States District Court here , did not charge any individuals . If found guilty , the committee would face a maximum fine of $1,000 on each count , or $3,000 . The committee said in ? a ' statement that the matter involved " a bona fide action " by the committee that its lawyers believed did not violate the law . The committee statement said the case reflected " a difference of opinion " on the definition of a " contribution " and ' noted that the contribution at issue had been returned to the donor " several months ago . " Action Was Urged The General Accounting Office , the auditing arm of Congress , had referred " apparent violations " of the Federal Election Campaign Act involving the Vesco contribution to the Justice Department for action last March 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed impatience that no action had been taken . In unusually blunt language , the G.A.O . said then that since referring the case to the Justice Department , " We have had no direct response from the Deb partment of Jastice as to the nature of its efforts or , intentions , if any , in this direction . " Signed by Phillip S. Hughes , director of the agency 's Office of Federal Elections , Friday 's statement urged " in the strongest terms " that the Attorney General take action against the alleged violations . Asked for comment this evening on the Justice Department 's action , Mr. Hughes said he understood that the department had felt that it had a " prosecutable offense " against the committee but not against any individuals . Mr. Hughes said that as a nonlawyer he did " not understand the legal reasoning . " He said he was " concdned " that there be effective penalties in the administration of the Federal campaign law and added : " I question whether $3,000 is that .
