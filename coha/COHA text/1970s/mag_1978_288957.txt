The Constitution divided the Government into three branches , but now there are really 3-with the Federal Reserve System being the half . It has so much latitude in money and banking that it is equal in independence to the Executive , Legislative and Judicial branches . The seven Federal Reserve governors can be removed only " for cause , " and none ever has been . Since they are appointed for 14-year terms , they can stay in Washington while Presidents come and go . Exempt from Civil Service rules , the board in Washington and the twelve regional Federal Reserve banks hire and fire whom they please . <P> This independence and geographical dispersion were exactly what Congress had in mind when , spearheaded by Virginia Senator Carter Glass , it created the Federal Reserve after a fight in 1913 between easy-money Westerners and hard-money Easterners . The Westerners wanted to be sure that the Fed would never be dominated by Wall Street . <P> The Fed even finances itself . It makes a profit buying and selling Government securities , turns most of the earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but keeps whatever it chooses as its own budget and tells no one what it does with the money . Several times Congress has asked to look at the Fed 's books ; the board has said no . <P> Its independence seldom brings fame . <P> The chairman is fairly well known , but , says Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire , " I bet only half a dozen members of Congress could tell the names of all the members of the board , and most people think that Ml is a gun used in World War II . " Few Washington cab drivers know the Fed 's address on Constitution Avenue . <P> Besides determining the nation 's money supply and , indirectly , interest rates , the Federal Reserve is also a kind of superbank . It lends money to member commercial banks , audits their books , writes the rules under which they operate . It can approve or disapprove mergers between banks , or tell a bank whether it can open a new branch in London . The Federal Reserve enforces ten laws enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must follow to make sure that women can get loans as easily as men . <P> The atmosphere at Washington headquarters has long been one of scholarly leisure . Governors , whose sumptuous offices are fitted with marble fireplaces , work comfortable 8:45-to-5:15 hours and have plenty of time for reading and contemplation . Members of the Federal Reserve 's superb staff , which produced the Government 's first computerized model of the economy in 1968 , can take a few months to study some obscure financial problem . According to persistent legend , Reserve employees also indulge in a good deal of partying and high living . Fed people say the stories are exaggerated , though the board long had its own tennis courts , and today its staffers almost monopolize some supposedly public courts near the building .
