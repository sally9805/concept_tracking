 | Unearthing the Secrets of a forgotten Kingdom @# IT TAKES an archeologist 's eye to see details of a lost city in the bleak ridges of an empty hillside . Paolo Matthiae , professor of archeology at the University of Rome , has that eye . Standing atop a mound half a mile in diameter , he points down to a ten-foot-wide cut into its side . " There , " he says , " was one of the city 's main gates . He waves to a slope leading up from the gate to the peak : All along that hillside lived the people of Ebla . At the top we have found the temples of their gods and palaces of their kings . " I recently stood atop that hill in the blazing sun of northern Syria and 88  | watched scientists digging up secrets of Ebla , once a great power in the ancient world . Now , scholars are agog as Italian archeologists unearth this city brick by brick . Why the excitement ? Because two glittering civilizations ? Egypt and Mesopotamia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian experts are demonstrating that a hitherto-unknown power stood alongside those two rivals . Ebla , at the head of a thriving empire around 2300 B.C. , was rich in commerce , arts and letters , with conquering kings who carried its influence far and wide . " These discoveries reveal a new culture , a new language , a new history , " exults the University of Chicago 's eminent historian of the ancient Near East , Prof. Ignace J. Gelb . " They are sensational . " For Bible scholars , there is a further sensation : the excavations reveal that Ebla 's mightiest king was Ebrum ? a name similar to Eber , the Biblical ancestor of the Hebrew people . Also found are names that evoke those of such Biblical people and places as David , Esau , Saul , Abraham , Israel , Sinai , Gaza ? even Jerusalem . Experts will be debating the significance of these findings for years to come . The Italians started digging into this hillside after Matthiae was commissioned in 1963 to find a site where the University of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the least excavated part of the Near East . Its plains are dotted with hundreds of mounds , known as tells , where succeeding cultures built fragile mud towns upon the ruins of previous settlements . Under each tell is a stack of layered civilizations . Only a few dozen tells had ever been excavated . In the 1930s , two French expeditions made spectacular discoveries at the ancient cities of Ugarit and Mari , which shed light on Syria 's culture , particularly in the period between 1900 B.C. and 1200 B.C. But it was the third millennium ( 3000-2000 B.C. ) ? the time when writing first developed in Mesopotamia and Egypt ? that Matthiae wanted to unveil . But which of the many hills to explore ? He was attracted to Tell Mardikh , a huge 14o-acre mound 34 miles southwest of Aleppo . A large sculptured basin and pottery fragments of extreme antiquity had been found on its surface . He was convinced that , somewhere below , a rich and sophisticated society had once thrived . The following summer , with a small team of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of the Syrian Department of Antiquities , he recruited laborers and began to dig . Ruins of a oncethriving urban center of the Middle Bronze Age , which began about 2000 B.C. , were uncovered : first , a few weeks after digging began , a massive city gate ; then , in 1966-67 , part of a royal palace ; and , a year later , a large temple . But what city was it ? One day in 1968 , diggers pulled  | from the debris the broken torso of a royal statue . On its shoulder and chest could be seen the wedgeshaped slashes of history 's firstknown writing , " cuneiform " ( from Latin cuneus , wedge ) . A team member who could read Akkadian , one of the earliest Mesopotamian languages , translated the 26 lines , apparently a dedication to a local goddess . On the seventh line , he came to the words " in Ebla . " Ebla ! Team members gasped . Could this be the mysterious Ebla mentioned in inscriptions found in Mesopotamia and Egypt ? Many scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern Turkey ) . After detailed study of the torso inscription , Matthiae and his team decided that they had indeed found ancient Ebla and announced their conclusion to the scientific world . Reaction was excited but skeptical , and the Italians searched on doggedly for more evidence . In 1973 , they began to find ruins at a deeper , and therefore older , level . Pottery fragments ? painstakingly dug out , sorted , washed and catalogued ? showed that the older city dated back to at least 2400 B.C. Baffled Linguist . At this new level , diggers came upon the ruins of a three-story palace with a spacious audience court , a stairway and several paved rooms . It was filled with debris , including shards of scorched pottery . Comparing them with dated ceramic ware from other Near East ruins , archeologists determined that the palace had been in existence until about 2250 B.C. Now things began to fit . Several Mesopotamian inscriptions had recorded that Ebla was conquered by the powerful Mesopotamian state of Akkad and destroyed by fire about 2250 B.C. The date checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 , while clearing out one of the palace rooms , the Italians got verification that this was Ebla . A workman 's shovel lifted two rounded objects , each bearing 20 minute inscriptions . Dusting them off , the excavators found that they were hard clay tablets covered with cuneiform writing . In all , 42 inscribed tablets were found . No one in the expedition could read them , and Matthiae fired off a telegram to Italian epigraphist Giovanni Pettinato , who hurried to Syria . Pettinato was baffled : " I can not understand a single word . " True , the signs were ordinary cuneiform , but the words were neither Akkadian nor Sumerian , the earliest Mesopotamian language . It was a new tongue . In 1975 Matthiae 's team uncovered a room next to the palace entrance and found about a thousand tablets scattered on the floor . The digging season was almost over when workmen in another room discovered the find of a lifetime : some 14,000 inscribed tablets , stacked on the floor where they had fallen from burning shelves , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ioo clay " dictionaries , " giving the Sumerian equivalents for some 3000 Eblaite words , which made it far easier to decipher the new language . The Italians , it was soon confirmed , had discovered the world 's oldest state archive : official records of the kingdom of Ebla for more than a century . Empire Revealed . The dozen tablets now studied reveal that Ebla 's dominion extended far beyond its own borders . It received financial tribute from distant city-states in the Euphrates River valley . " For part of the third millennium , " says Pettinato , " Ebla was the greatest power in the Near East . " The city was absorbed with commerce : many clay tablets are " bills of lading " listing cargoes dispatched on donkey caravans . Ebla 's weavers and metal workers were famous , and its artisans exported graceful wooden furniture , often overlaid with gold . For these valued products , Ebla 's clients may have paid in silver ingots or with such a commodity as barley . Barley provided the city 's staple food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show was one of Ebla 's drinks . Some 500 gods and goddesses were worshiped at Ebla , including the familiar Ishtar and Dagan . As in Mesopotamia , temples played a considerable social and economic role . From their land and herds , temple employes were presumably fed and clothed ; in times of crisis , any citizen could seek refuge at a temple . The king 's palace was the biggest employer . Into it poured proceeds of the royal estates and vassal cities . Some 11,700 employes ? a quarter of the population ? were on the public payroll ; a number of them worked at the looms and cutting tables of the textile industry , which was under state control . Many of the clay tablets discovered in the archives are lessons or examinations for the scribes ' school . Kings might issue decrees and merchants negotiate prices , but scribes ? key men in Ebla 's society ? had to transmit these decisions into a language understood by all . Month after month , students copied lines written by the teacher in Eblaite or Sumerian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All in all , Ebla seems to have been a happy place . Its elegant art and vigorous commerce suggest a free , relaxed atmosphere . There is evidence of a king remarkably close to his subjects : one side of Ebla 's royal  | palace was open to the public , and its courtyard seems to have been a part of everyday urban activity . Biblical Parallels . Among the most tantalizing of Ebla 's enigmas are the similarities between some of its tablets and passages of the Old Testament written more than a millennium later . An example is the two " sin cities " of Sodom and Gomorrah . Scholars had never found any mention of either place outside Biblical texts . But they are listed in an Ebla tablet . There is another fascinating Biblical parallel . The tablets indicate that during the reign of King Ebrum , Ebla 's most dynamic monarch , the Eblaite religion underwent a change . Men 's first names had carried a suffix glorifying the god El : for example , Micha-el , Isra-el . Now men 's names paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Micha-ya and Israya . This might seem insignificant , except for the fact that the Hebrews also used both El and Ya ( Yahweh ) for the name of God . None of this is reason to conclude that Ebla is the origin of the Hebrew people . But , says Cyrus Gordon , professor of Hebraic studies at New York University , it shows that we are dealing with the same cultural background from which the Hebrews emerged . Anything beyond that is guesswork , for it may be two or three decades before the translation o the clay tablets from Ebla 's r palace , now stored in Aleppo 's museum , is completed .
