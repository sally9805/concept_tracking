Along about the middle of spring training the world champion Pittsburgh Pirates locked themselves in their clubhouse at Bradenton , Fla. to vote on a proposal that would authorize action against baseball 's owners unless certain moneys were forthcoming to sweeten an already fat pension plan . The Pirate meeting lasted about an hour . Afterward , when Dave Giusti , the team 's player representative , was asked why it had taken so long , he said , " The main problem I had was to tell some of the players how to spell the word strike . " // By the end of last week , with the opening game only a few days away , all the players knew the word well enough . They vacated training sites in Arizona , Florida and California , forcing the postponement of the remaining exhibition games and imperiling a season that had been rich with promise . Owners and players alike seemed to have their heels dug in over the players ' request for a 17% cost-of-living adjustment in the pension plan . At present the plan pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 , or $7,416.48 at 65 . Men who play longer are guaranteed increasingly higher benefits under a retirement program unimaginable to most workers in the nation today . Take Joe Gibbon as an example . A 37-year-old pitcher for Cincinnati who has averaged 54 innings of work over the last four seasons , he can cash in at the age of 45 after 12 years in the majors and draw $5,584.32 a year for the rest of his life . Or he can wait until age 65 and receive $19,501.32. // The owners seemed united and militant in their stand , while the players were also united , albeit somewhat confused and , on the whole , anxious to play . Pension money triggered the strike , but the players had another , more emotional , impulse : a feeling that the owners were trying to destroy the Players Association because of their deep-seated dislike of Executive Director Marvin Miller . // John Gaherin , negotiator for the owners , and Miller continued to meet in New York at the end of a fruitless week . The owners were unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a way out proposed by the players . And the fans were in a position reminiscent of the people who used to go to the edge of a very crooked creek in Alabama . The creek was so crooked that no matter how hard or often they tried to jump over it they kept coming down on the wrong side . Eventually , of course , they learned to walk around it . // Before the furor , and the unexpected death of New York Met Manager Gil Hodges , the game appeared to be having a delightful spring . Some of the players even seemed to like what they were doing . " It 's odd , is n't it , " Al Kaline said one day , " that you have to come to the end of the line before you realize how lucky you are . " Steve Arlin , a practicing dentist of 26 who pitched in such tough luck for the San Diego Padres last season that he had a 9-19 record and did not even gel his face on the bubble-gum cards , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality for a four-year pension , " Arlin said . " Dentistry is my backup job , my insurance policy . I 'm in the major leagues because I want to do certain things , and 9-19 is n't what I have in mind . If I pitch until I 'm 34 I can still practice dentistry for 30 years . If I did n't play baseball I 'm sure I would look back at age 40 and wonder about the blank space in my life . Baseball brings an added richness . " // Virtually every day crowds of people flocked to Bradenton to see the Pirates at work  --  and to scrutinize Manager Bill Virdon and Danny Murtaugh , his predecessor . When Murtaugh retired last fall he was heeding an old saying : " I want to be able to walk through the garden while I can still smell the roses . " Today Murtaugh is the Pirates ' director of player acquisition and development , and thus a man concerned with youth . One morning he assembled all the young infielders and spoke to them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the big club you will notice that some of our infielders are getting a little old . A minimum of six times this season Manager Bill Virdon is going to have to reach down into our minor league system and bring someone up . It will seldom be the best athlete . It will be the man the Pirates believe can do the things needed now . In Pittsburgh there is no sitting around . If you get to the Pirates , gentlemen , you will play . " // Murtaugh made no such promise to fledgling outfielders . What with Stargell , Clemente et al . around , so talented a slugger as Richie Zisk was sent to the minors last week . " I 'm like an extra time player in the New York Philharmonic , " said Zisk mournfully . // This year 's new franchise is in Arlington , Texas , a community of 110,000 generally considered to be located right where the hyphen is in Dallas-Fort Worth . The Cleveland Indians have been sold again , this time to Nick Mileti , " The Sicilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set their alarm clocks to ring every five years because that 's when the tax shelters run out and the club has to be sold again . ) There are new uniforms all over the place and the most spectacular are the red , white and blue ones to be worn by the Atlanta Braves . The biggest ovation of the year probably will go to a man wearing one of those new uniforms , Henry Aaron , on the night of July 25 , when he steps up to hit in the All-Star Game at Atlanta . Aaron is starting his countdown toward Babe Ruth 's record of 714 home runs and he needs 76 to break it . A most popular man , Aaron over the last two seasons has accumulated more All-Star votes than any other player  --  2,514,163 . Next come Johnny Bench , 2,151,785 ; Boog Powell , 1,833,043 ; Brooks Robinson , 1,725,561 ; Willie Mays , 1,669,893 ; and Carl Yastrzemski , 1,659,739. // Bench , of course , is trying to make a big comeback with the revamped Reds in Cincinnati . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will not tip his cap to fans when he hits a homer . History tells us that two things happen to a man who docs not tip his cap : a ) he is booed ; b ) he becomes manager of the Texas Rangers . // As usual , there were rookies in plenty this spring and some fascinating ones , at that . One seemed to come out of the blue sky over Lakeland , Fla . Fred Holdsworth , a 19-year-old right-handed pitcher , although eventually sent to Toledo for regular work , looks like he might become the fourth starter Detroit has been searching for in its attempt to overtake Baltimore . Holdsworth is a Detroit area boy who was valedictorian of his high school class . " Valedictorian ? " Manager Billy Martin said . " Does that mean you get to eat lunch first ? " // This is the season after all those winter trades and the players seem as bewildered as the fans . Frank Robinson is in Los Angeles and Jim Fregosi in New York . Lee May will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comeback in Cleveland . Nolan Ryan is in Anaheim and Denny McLain in Oakland while Sudden Sam McDowell has lit in San Francisco . // ( And talk about a different drum . Remember Richie-Dick Allen ? At first reported lost , he signed a contract with the White Sox at approximately the same time the rest of the players were striking. ) // It could be that some of the trades that did not receive large headlines will turn out to decide the pennant races . The Twins , for example , picked up two of the prime relief pitchers in baseball  --  Wayne Granger from Cincinnati and Dave LaRoche from California . When Bill Rigney has two such pitchers to juggle around there is no telling what might happen . It is said of Twin pitchers that when Rigney allows a man to work a complete game the pitcher goes home , sits on the bed and keeps repeating . " I ca n't believe I pitched the whooole thing . " LaRoche is the man who stood on his head in the corner of the dressing room after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Another time he hid under a table . " I just like to relax , " he explained . // To be sure , neither LaRoche 's pitching nor his methods of relaxation will close the gap between the National and American leagues , which seems wider now than ever before . In the last two years the Nationals outdrew the Americans by over 10 million fans . It does n't help that Frank Robinson , Sam McDowell and Jim Fregosi , drawing cards all , were traded out of the American League . Nor is it encouraging to reflect that the league will be without Vida Blue for at least a month ; that Frank Howard did not swing a bat in spring training ; that Denny McLain lost 22 games in 1971 ; that Kansas City 's Freddie Patek , the league leader in triples and No. 2 man in stolen bases , is on the disabled list as the season starts ; that Yaz did not have a good spring . // The subject of leadership on the Baltimore Orioles became a daily thing this spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the league that without Robinson the Orioles may find themselves in a tough pennant chase . The Orioles tend to minimize the situation because they feel the lessons taught by Robinson have been well learned . What Frank himself says is this : " If I had to pinpoint the leader this year I really could n't say . Brooks Robinson is not made that way and Boog Powell shies away from the role . Among the pitchers , Dave McNally is a line leader . He plays when he 's hurt and battles all the time . Among the players who play every day , I think Merv Rettenmund might turn out to be the leader type . " // Watch for that , and also note the wonders weight-watching has wrought throughout the game . Mike Epstein of the Oakland A 's dropped 17 pounds , George Scott of Milwaukee 20 , Les Cain of Detroit 30 and McDowell 18 . The man probably most responsible was Joe Tone of the Cardinals ( see cover ) , who went on a water diet two years ago , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Most Valuable Player . // Torre did everything . He hit .363 , drove in 137 runs and collected 230 hits while accounting for 352 total bases . In no month of the season did his batting average go below .324 , and his pattern was all but incredible : .363 against righthanders , .362 against lefthanders. // This spring Torre signed two one-year contracts with the Cardinals calling for $130,000 in 1972 and $150,000 in 1973 . He is one of some 25 players currently making over $100,000. // " The oddest thing about my signing , " Torre says , " is that not too many people knew that I had made $100,000 last year . This winter people would n't ask me what I hit , but what I weighed . Before I signed I was running laps to get myself ready . One afternoon a kid came up oil a bicycle . I had on a red jacket , sweat pants and sneakers . He said , " You a ballplayer ? ' I told him I was . ' Who 'd you play for last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinals . ' What 's your name ? " Torre . ' What position did you play ? " Third base . He said , ' I met a player named Russ Snyder once , ' and pedaled off . I sure earned some kind of fame . // " In many ways maybe the best thing that happened to me was when we traded Richie Allen at the end of the 1970 season . I had come to St. Louis when they had Brock , Flood , McCarver  --  players like that  --  so true pressure was never on me . When I played in Atlanta the real pressure was on Henry Aaron . When he did n't get a hit in a big situation the whole bench would deflate . When Allen left the Cards the pressure shifted to me . Actually , it is n't pressure so much as it is responsibility . Now I know that the guys are looking to me and I ca n't gel down on myself because they are watching . I never rooted and hollered as much on a bench as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get down on themselves or the team . // " When we lost Bob Gibson for a month , it was n't just a matter of his missing three or four turns in the pitching rotation . We missed him on the bench . He keeps everybody up , needles you , corrects you , challenges you to be better . One night in Philadelphia I got two hits my first two times up and then popped up a pitch I should have really done something with . I normally do n't show any emotion unless I get mad at an umpire . I do n't bust watercoolers or throw-bats . But I was mad and sat down next to Gibson and told him I should have had the third hit . He said , ' You really think you can get a hit everytime up ? " I told him I did . ' Shhh , ' he said . ' Even I ca n't do that . ' " // That 's with the ball parks open , of course .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
