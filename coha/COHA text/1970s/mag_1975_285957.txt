While efforts to develop a U.S. energy policy have been stymied by endless wrangling within Congress and between the legislators and the White House , the nation 's energy situation has deteriorated . Domestic production of oil has declined steadily during the past year , and a relaxation of public conservation measures and the nation 's quickening economic pace have caused U.S. oil imports to return to pre-Arab embargo levels . Indeed , the U.S. has become more dependent than ever on <P> Arab oil ; it now draws 26% of its petroleum imports from Arab supplies ( v. 16% in late 1974 ) and is more vulnerable to a new shutoff . More alarming is a looming shortage of natural gas , the nation 's No. 2 energy source ( it provides the fuel for an estimated 60% of U.S. industry and heats 55% of all American homes ) . That scarcity could become so severe next winter that natural gas would replace oil as the country 's No. 1 energy worry . President Ford warned last week that the low gas supplies " will mean substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> So far , Congress has seemed capable of achieving consensus only on minor energy measures . Last week , in an unusual display of unanimity , the Senate voted 91 to 0 to build up a three-month national reserve of oil by storehousing supplies in salt domes , idle tankers and even abandoned mines-a sound precaution but hardly a basic solution . By an impressive margin of 391 to 20 , the House decided to allow commercial oil drilling in the Elk Hills , Buena Vista and Teapot Dome reserves , which have been husbanded for emergency military use . But two of the fields are small and already partially depleted . <P> Diametrically Opposed . Congress is now getting around to the basics . This week the House and Senate are expected to begin debates on bills that deal with prices of the nation 's two most vital fuels . Unfortunately , the debates probably will throw into sharp contrast the diametrically opposed approaches of the White House and the Democrats who control Congress . The Ford Administration favors relatively swift abolition of fuel-price controls in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . Last Saturday , Ford announced that he will send to Congress this week a price-decontrol plan for domestic oil . The Democrats , fearful of the inflationary impact of decontrol of oil and gas , advocate price adjustments within the framework of continued federal price regulation . <P> The House bill is a massive attempt by Democrats to throw the full weight of the U.S. Government against the price-setting power of OPEC and thus roll back the price of petroleum . It would reduce the price of " new " domestic crude ( oil in excess of what was produced in 1972 ) from its present $13 per bbl. to $7.50 . Producers in especially high-cost drilling areas , like offshore , would be allowed to charge $8.50 per bbl . The price of " old " domestic crude , which is now frozen at $5.25 per bbl. , would be allowed to rise to $7.50 also-but only over a five-year period . The House bill would please consumers , since it would hold down energy prices , but oilmen argue that the measure would stifle the incentive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
