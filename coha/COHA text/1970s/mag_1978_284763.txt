Wycliffians practice phonetics so they can preach the Gospel <P> The tongues of men have proliferated considerably since the Tower of Babel helped explain how the sons of Noah came to converse in so many different languages . Today there are 3,000 languages in the world , most of them oral only , which makes life difficult for Christian missionaries sworn to spread the word of God as widely as possible . Most Bible societies , in fact , concentrate mainly on getting adequate translations into the major written languages . But the Summer Institute of Linguistics has a longer reach . For the past 42 years , following the teachings of its founder W. Cameron Townsend , S.I.L . teams have been seeking out tiny , isolated tribes in remote corners of the world . With a little help from tape recorders , phonetics and the science of linguistics , they create written language out of the primitive spoken word ; eventually they teach the tribesmen how to read primers written in the vocabulary they talk , and present them with a readable New Testament printed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an example of global evangelism and literacy instruction , the overseas work of S.I.L . and its U.S. counterpart , known as the Wycliffe Bible Translators , can not be matched . It has brought reading and Bible translations to 90 previously illiterate tribes , and is currently at work with 650 more . Counting pilots and support personnel , literacy teachers and workers in community development , agriculture and medicine , the agency has a staff of 3,700 , making it by far the largest U.S. mission . Until recently , at least , it was still growing . <P> But last week S.I.L . missions faced a serious rebuff in one of their most successful fieldwork areas-among tribes deep in the Amazon jungles of Brazil . The natives are not hostile-far from it . Forty-four field teams , mostly married couples , backed by five support bases equipped with light planes and sophisticated radio gear , have been peaceably at work for 22 years . But the government of Brazil has suddenly announced that in 1978 it will not renew permits for S.I.L . field teams to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No official explanation has been offered . <P> The reason seems clear : the Brazilian government wants to turn the Indians into fully integrated Portuguese-speaking Brazilians as fast as possible , so that it will not be hampered by them in its attempts to exploit remote mineral deposits and open the country to land developers . It is thus opposed to anyone-and that includes S.I.L . personnel-who contributes to " keeping the Indians in their natural state . " S.I.L . officers and many Brazilian linguists deny the charge , in part because S.I.L . teams , once they make a tribe literate in its own language , customarily proceed to teach the tribesmen Portuguese as well . In conjunction with several Brazilian universities , the mission is still negotiating to keep many of its linguistic teams in the field , perhaps with Brazilian linguists working alongside , at least until they have finished the four New Testaments now nearing completion and eight more that are expected to be ready within two years .                  @ @ @
