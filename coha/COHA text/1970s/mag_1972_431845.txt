 | A SCORE OF NAKED WARRIORS stared at us , granite-faced . Some of them spoke urgently in the guttural language of West Irian 's Asmat people , but I could not understand . As I helped my wife Barbara out of our canoe onto the steep bank below Sagopo village , I looked in vain for the chattering women and children who usually come to the landing place to welcome strangers . A single female face , daubed with ocher as for some special occasion , appeared in the doorway of a thatched stilt house . The woman handed a bow and arrows to the warrior leader and then vanished . The atmosphere disturbed me . The men were tense and uneasy , and the village was unnaturally silent . " There 's something wrong , is n't there ? " I asked Dr. Clemens Voorhoeve , our linguist companion . " Yes , and we 'd better get out of here , " Bert  | answered tersely . " I 'll explain why later . " We shoved off into the shallow , swift Undir River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us around a bend and out of sight of the village . " It sounds unbelievable , " said Bert , " but Andreas and Ndep here " ? he indicated our nervous guides ? " say we walked right into a headhunting raid . " Everyone we saw was from another village , not Sagopo . The Sagopo people heard  | them coming and fled . We did well to get away . Those fellows were nervous and might have , attacked us if we had done anything they construed as threatening . " No Headhunting Allowed , but .. . Officially , headhunting ended at least ten years ago in the Asmat country of West Irian ( map , page 382 ) . * Certainly the Indonesian Government and the missionaries have stamped it out in the more accessible areas . But I had seen enough and heard enough to become convinced that in remote parts of the territory 's 10,000 square miles of swampy jungle it is still practiced . The incident at Sagopo strengthened my conviction . So did the events that followed as we made our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ti . We saw no one on either bank , but we felt we were being watched . Bright-green parrots burst squawking from the jungle ahead of the canoe , frightened by something or someone we did not see . We passed two empty canoes tied to the bank , then a house from which curled a plume of smoke . We waved and shouted greetings . Only the shrill screech of insects answered . In midafternoon we reached Ti , approaching cautiously and turning the canoe around at the landing so that it pointed downriver , ready for a quick escape . Our precautions were unnecessary ; the people fled into the jungle as we came near . Only after considerable coaxing by Ndep , who had relatives among them , would they return . The first man to come back did a curious thing . From the jungle he brought a pole to which was nailed a tattered , dirty Indonesian flag . This he planted in the middle of the *John Scofield described a visit to the Asmat in the  | village . We surmised that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some magic power and would protect them . Barbara and I brought out our trading items ? knives , axes , tobacco , and fishhooks . We exchanged these things for shields and for the bone and crocodile-jaw daggers the men customarily wore in their armbands . Then we began to take pictures . Instant Portrait Brings Misgivings In this remote village , the cameras frightened the people . Barbara tried a Polaroid picture of a young girl . The men , seeing the instant photograph , muttered among themselves . The girl tried to rub her image from the print with a forefinger . Despite his misgivings , the Ti chief allowed us to take more pictures and to visit the jeu , or ceremonial house . In its dim interior we made out a row of fireplaces , and near each we saw a supply of arrows . The longer we stayed the more uneasy the people became . They seemed relieved when we left . Once back in the canoe , Andreas said something to Bert . " He says that all the time we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ready to kill us on signal , " Bert told me . " But why ? " I asked . " Andreas says the Ti people had gone headhunting recently and had killed five people . They thought we might have come to punish them . That 's why they ran away at first , then kept us covered . " It was n't the best day to be on this particular river ! I know of no outsider who has actually seen Asmat headhunters killing their victims . Wherever you travel in this harsh land ,  | however , you hear accounts of such raids , and they are so detailed that they could hardly have been invented . In Sauwa-Erma , a double village straddling the Pomatsj River , we heard an old chief , Takais , describe an attack his people had made some years earlier on the upstream village of Pupis . A crowd of men and boys gathered around as Takais talked . The Reverend Richard Frank , an American Roman Catholic missionary , translated for us . " The old man is claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erma villager by Pupis people , " said Father Frank . " Allied villages were asked to send warriors . They did so , and the party assembled in Erma . While the men painted their canoes with ocher and powdered lime , the women gathered food in anticipation of a victory feast and exhorted the men to fight bravely . " Then the raiders put on headbands of fur and tied streamers of white feathers to their paddles , " Father Frank continued . " They pushed the canoes off and in late afternoon made a rough bivouac a few river bends downstream from Pupis . " The war chiefs now slipped away into the jungle on reconnaissance . " At this point an old man in Takais 's audience came to his feet , picked up a shield , and , crouching low , began creeping around . " Ah , " said Father Frank , " that is Saati ,  | who was one of the chiefs on the raid . He is reenacting the reconnaissance . " Now Takais resumed the narrative . " When the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two parties , " explained the missionary . " At dawn one slipped through the jungle to take Pupis from the rear . The other went in the canoes to a bend just below the settlement . Handful of Lime Signals Attack " Chief Ardji and a few trusted fighters paddled on to the village , coming to it as the people were beginning to stir about and light their fires . Ardji called out that he had no fire and needed an ember to start one . " Suddenly Takais made a throwing motion , and I sensed rising excitement in the group of listeners . " He is demonstrating how Ardji signaled the attack to begin by throwing lime into the air , " Father Frank said . " Confused and terrified , the people of Pupis rushed to their huts for weapons , but too late . Spears and arrows flew . Men , women , and children were slaughtered indiscriminately . Some forty villagers died . " Singing triumphantly ? ' We have killed a man , we have killed a man , we are happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near a river junction where spirits inhabit the whirlpools . They dug a shallow trench the Headhunters in Today 's World 391 p 391 length of a man . Dragging each body through the trench , the warriors shouted : There 's no need for you to attack us again . We 've revenged our dead now , so let 's live in peace . ' " The raiders cut off the victims ' heads and limbs with bamboo knives and brought the dismembered bodies to Erma . The women accompanied their husbands and the bodies into the ceremonial house , where witnesses related how each head was taken . " Then the heads were baked and the skin removed . The brains , shaken out through a hole cut in the temple , were eaten . The lower jaw was severed and worn on a necklace . " Missing Jaw Denotes Violent Death In the Asmat , a skull with a hole in the temple and the lower jaw missing is invariably the trophy of a headhunting raid . The skulls of those who have died natural deaths are never holed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 378-9 ) ; both are used as pillows , and are also worn occasionally to ward off the spirits of their original owners . Twice during our stay in the Asmat we saw obviously fresh skulls with pierced temples and no lower jaws . Once a man offered to trade me a human skull , quite fresh , for a jungle knife . At several places , men who possessed trophy skulls also wore human vertebrae on necklaces ( page 394 ) , and explained that the vertebrae had belonged to the men from whom they had taken the skulls . Despite Indonesia 's efforts , the grisly practice of headhunting is by no means dead . As we traveled about the Asmat ( the name , incidentally , refers both to the region and to its 20,000 or so inhabitants ) , we were given invaluable assistance by missionaries , especially the Crosier Fathers. * It was a singleengine missionary plane , in fact , that had brought us from the West Irian capital of Djajapura to Agats , administrative center of the Asmat . From it we had our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that vast swamp , where streams from 15,000-foot mountains meet tidewater flowing as much as 40 miles inland from the sea ( pages 382-3 ) . Water governs the day-to-day life of the Asmat people and provides their only thoroughfares . Barbara , Bert , and I took to the rivers in the manner of the natives , exploring backwaters and byways by dugout canoe powered by a sturdy outboard . Like the natives , we took our chances with crocodiles . One , by actual count , had killed 54 people , dragging some of them from their boats . Asmat villages always stand by a waterway , the houses raised on poles above the mud . At high tide , the rivers overflow and inundate the forest . At low , the receding waters leave broad expanses of dark mud in which people grub for shellfish . Seafood is an important part of the Asmat diet . So are lizards , pigs , and cassowaries ? wild flightless birds almost as large as ostriches . Palm Provides Both " Bread " and " Meat " But the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm , which is eaten roasted . We went one day with an Asmat family to watch them prepare it . We paddled far into the swamp , where the sago grows best , and landed in a tangle of mangrove roots . Otor , our host , selected a tall palm and felled it with his ax . The men then chopped the trunk into sections . Otor 's family pounded the pith into a dry pulp , which they mixed with water and strained to separate the fiber from the starch . Lumps of the white , flourlike residue were roasted until they became crusty on the outside . The family ate the crusts and roasted the lumps over and over until nothing was left . From the sago palm comes also the great Asmat delicacy , the sago grub , which is the soft white larva of the capricorn beetle . The *See " New Guinea 's Fierce Asmat : A Heritage of Headhunting , " by Father Alphonse Sowada , head of the Crosier Mission , in Vanishing Peoples of the Earth , a National Geographic Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two Wares " daughters " rock in the arms of Basim tribesmen after their ceremonial rebirth . Soon they will rise to feed men from both halves of the village , demonstrating the younger generation 's dual allegiance . The juvenile roles continue for several days . Pretending childish innocence , the men learn anew to hunt and the women to fish ; both play games with the village 's youngsters . All six then return to their original homes and families but remain living links uniting Basim and Wares .  | people actually raise these . They fell a tree and cut holes in the trunk to let the beetles in . The beetles lay their eggs , the eggs hatch into grubs , and the villagers collect them after about six weeks , when they are a couple of inches long ( page 403 ) . We often watched our hosts roast grubs on bamboo slivers . I tried to eat one , but could n't bring myself to swallow it . A complex culture has evolved over generations in this humid region . We heard much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the Asmat in 1950 . " The Asmat equates a human with a tree , " Father Zegwaard explained to us in Djakarta , Indonesia 's capital , where he now works . " His legs are the roots , his torso the trunk , his arms the branches , and his head the fruit . " In certain parts of the Asmat , he said , a freshly severed head ? the fruit was needed to initiate a boy into manhood . The boy sat with the head between his thighs , and its power was transferred magically to him . Ther the boy was paddled out to sea by male relatives , in the direction of the setting sun where the spirits of all ancestors go . Playing the role of an old man , the boy pretended to grow weaker and eventually feigned death . An uncle immersed him in the sea , and the boy was ritually reborn . " On the return journey , " Father Zegwaard continued , " the boy slowly came to life and was taught the names of trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the village ,  | he was given the name of the victim , whose power he assumed . " So you see , in a sense there had to be death for life to continue . " Carving of Poles Foretells Revenge The government campaign against headhunting has included the destruction of many ieus , the ceremonial houses of Asmat villages . Indonesian officials are well aware that the planning of raids takes place in them . Unfortunately , however , they have other uses . The ieu is a men 's social and cultural house , as well as a bachelor quarters . Wherever these structures have been burned by the government , they are sorely missed . In addition to destroying the houses , the government has tried to stop the carving of bis poles ( pages 392-3 ) , which are also closely associated with headhunting . But in a few Asmat villages that have escaped government surveillance , one can still find the ceremonial houses and the poles . Sculptured from whole tree trunks , a bis represents kinsmen slain by enemy warriors . Every bis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says something about the deadliness of local warfare among the Asmat . Once finished , bis poles become the focus of ceremonies that traditionally are followed by raids of revenge upon those who have killed the bis owners ' kinsmen . At Pirien , a village we reached from the sea after pushing our canoe over barricades of  | logs placed across the Ewta River , we found men working on no less than five bis poles . Pirien , we knew , had recently fought with Otsjanep , a village a short distance upstream , and supposedly had slaughtered the Otsjanep war chiefs . Did the carving of the forbidden bis presage a further attack upon Otsjanep by the people of Pirien ? We could not tell . We had noticed that the people of Otsjanep seemed afraid to come downstream past Pirien . But the men wielding their crude chisels were gay , cheerful , and apparently at peace with all the world . Adoption Ritual Unites Communities In Basim-Wares , a double village several miles south of Otsjanep , we witnessed the colorful tasor juwi ? literally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Casuarina Coast , or southern half of the Asmat shore . Adults play the role of children in this adoption feast , which has evolved over the years to smooth tensions between neighboring villages ( pages 388-90 ) . I , too , became an adopted citizen of BasimWares , through a simple little ceremony in which I pretended to suckle the wife of my new " father , " a chief named Betakam . I suspect he wanted me in his family mainly because I possessed a supply of trade goods ? knives , tobacco , and fishhooks . In the village of Erma , Barbara was adopted by the war chief Saati , who explained that she reminded him of his dead sister . Saati gave my wife a new name : Bonap . It meant " same face . " Bert noticed a scar on Saati 's calf and asked him how he got it . A gleam flickered in the old warrior 's eyes , and he jabbed a clawlike finger into Bert 's chest . He repeated one word ? unintelligible to us ? over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down the sights of an imaginary rifle . " He is telling you it was the Japanese during the war who caused the scar , " Father Frank explained . " The soldiers came up the Pomatsj River here . A bullet passed through Saati 's leg . " Saati was prouder , though , of two other scars , arrow wounds on his right thigh and left bicep . " Wejo , " he said ; this was the name of an upstream village against which he once led an attack . " And what about these ? " Bert asked , drawing attention to two scars on Saati 's buttocks . " Pupis , " Saati said , referring to the raid Takais had described to us . " In the bottom ? " Bert queried . " They must have got you as you were running away ! You 're a coward , " he teased . " No ! No ! " Saati shouted indignantly . " I was caught by surprise . " Though warfare is closely linked with religion , marriage and birth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family home , with older women attending the mother . The father , with a heroic display of indifference , wanders off to chat with friends . Marriages generally are arranged by parents , with the wealth and prestige of each family well in mind ( opposite ) . If the girl refuses to wed the selected boy , her parents plead with her and beat her until she agrees . On rare occasions a girl and boy elope . Sorrow Takes a Dramatic Turn Death to the Asmat is an excuse for drama . One day as Barbara and I arrived at Omadesep village , we heard loud wailing . Outside a house overflowing with mourning villagers , we learned that its owner , Doupak , had just died of flu . His wives and other relatives were overcome with sorrow . Several women rolled in mud patches beside the house ( following pages ) . Some lay prostrate on their stomachs , rose to their knees , and then fell again . Two women hugged each other in grief . Another repeatedly stabbed the ground with a short dagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of men emerged from the house , bearing the body of the dead man on their shoulders . We watched from the shore as the Mock gloom marks an Asmat wedding . The bride 's mother wails at losing her ( laughter ; the bridegroom makes a symbolic dash for freedom , ending in his capture and sullen return ( upper left ) . Haloed in feathers and cuscus fur , his unsmiling bride-to-be rides an uncle 's shoulders to the house of the groom 's parents ( upper right ) . Face-to-face , both teen-age partners feign dejection , then whisper each other 's name to the uncle . His wish for mutual happiness completes the ritual .  | villagers paddled or swam across the river to a coconut grove on the opposite bank . There they buried the body . In earlier times they would simply have placed the corpse on a platform to rot . Sometimes the Asmat begin mourning before the subject is truly dead . In Basim , the Reverend Anthony van de Wouw told us about a man who was dying when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They suffocated the poor fellow , " the missionary told us . In another case , an old woman collapsed and was placed on a platform in front of her house , in which the family gathered and loudly proclaimed their grief . " The people got a frightful shock when the woman walked into the house , demanding to know what was going on . Apparently she had only fainted , " Father van de Wouw said . " Everyone is still a little wary of her . She was here today , incidentally , to tell me how strong she is while everybody else has flu . " Brother 's Death Doubles Responsibilities One morning , Father van de Wouw led us to a typical family dwelling . The owner , Wek , and his two wives greeted us from their veranda , eight feet above the ground . Then Wek helped us climb a notched pole to the entrance , one of four openings in the house . As we stood on the veranda , Father van de Wouw explained : " The wife on Wek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with custom , Wek will look after her and her children . His brother also was head of this house , so Wek has taken on that responsibility , too . Six related families live here now , and the house is called Wek 's to ? canoe . " We ducked our heads and entered the open doorway . The only light inside the 30-by-60-foot structure came from the entrances and from chinks in the thatched roof and barkcovered floor ( page 409 ) . " Each of the fireplaces here belongs to one family , " Father van de Wouw said . " In the old days , these houses were much longer , with as many as 16 fireplaces . Now the government tries to persuade the people to build individual family homes . I do n't agree with that policy . " For one thing , it takes too long for one family to build a house ; the able-bodied members have to go out almost every day to get food , and have little time left for building . What 's more , the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rots so quickly . " " I wonder if there is n't another advantage , " Barbara said . " Parents can leave their babies to play together , knowing that older people in the house can look after them . " As we stood talking , a man lying near a wall shifted his pillow . It was a skull , and , like others scattered around the room , it had a lower jaw . Its nose and eye sockets were decorated with red and gray seeds . " Skulls of relatives , " explained Father van de Wouw . " The Asmat have a dreadful fear of ghosts . But if you keep a man 's skull nearby , it will protect you from his spirit ! " Sleeping with a collection of skulls may sound unnerving , but Barbara , Bert , and I , who passed many nights in Asmat villages , soon became accustomed to it . Also , we carried small , easily erected tents . They were a great protection against mosquitoes in a malarial land , and once we had zippered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually we set up the tents inside the empty guesthouses to which we were escorted with cries of welcome . Astonished villagers passed the word : The strangers build houses inside houses . Everyone pressed to look , and usually we had more visitors than the house could comfortably contain . Peace Leaves Men in Idle Ease In many an Asmat family , women gather most of the food and do the cooking . The men guard them while they are working , although in these days of comparative peace , some husbands are inclined to stay home and talk while the wives go off to work . Near the coastal village of Omadesep , however , Barbara and I came across a strong guard of warriors keeping an eye on their women who were fishing a short distance from shore . Traditional enemies of the villagers , we gathered , lived nearby . Some of the men paddled us out to join the fisherwomen . Up to their waists in the water , these had formed into two lines , shaped like a V , that moved together and trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frightened quarry with nets of woven fibers ( pages 402-3 ) . It appeared to be hard work . Did the men help in any way ? Not at all . They merely watched . " It 's plain to see the Asmat is a man 's world , " Barbara remarked , as we described our canoe trip to Father van de Wouw . " Yes and no , " said the priest . " On the one hand , there is the case of a man I know who was being harangued by one of his wives . Quite casually he picked up his canoe paddle and speared her dead with the pointed handle . " On the other hand , " he continued , " it is not unusual to see a fierce-looking warrior tenderly holding the hand of a wife who had married him because the parents of the couple had arranged the union ! " Women 's Magic Fails ? or Did It ? During certain feasts , women traditionally attack their husbands . We happened upon one such ritual , prelude to a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies , armed with bone daggers . fish harpoons , and sticks , chased their menfolk about . They used their weapons vigorously , drawing blood on backs and arms . The men did not retaliate in any way . A bit later , we watched a delegation of men making the rounds of the houses and begging the women not to let it rain the day of the mask feast . The Asmat are convinced that their women can work magic , a power they greatly fear . I do n't know what the women replied , or what they did , but early in the morning a veritable cloudburst awakened us . " Hah ! " I snorted . " Women 's magic ! " " You do n't understand , " retorted my wife " They deliberately made it rain to show the men who were the real bosses . " But the men had the last word . In the middle of the pouring rain they ran out on their verandas and pounded on the walls of the Gift to keep the peace , an orphan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in Basim-Wares ; a palm-frond poncho protects both from a jungle downpour . Years ago , Yaptambor warriors killed this man 's son in a raid . To make amends , they recently offered him the boy . Now , if trouble flares again between the two villages , the boy could serve as emissary to Yaptambor without fear of being killed . Missionaries increasingly promote such peaceable alternatives that seek to stop the savagery of headhunting without destroying Asmat culture . BARBARA K  | houses with sticks and clubs . The racket either frightened the rainstorm away or scared the women into revoking their spell . In any case , the sun came out and the party went on as scheduled . Three Asmat had donned all-enveloping costumes made of rattan and palm frond ? masks , I suppose you might call them , for they covered their wearers ' faces as they did their entire bodies . We were told that two of them represented the spirits of villagers killed in fights ; these spirits were paying their final visits to their earthly homes . The third figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village by brave youngsters who tossed toy spears . Later , after invited guests from other villages joined the feast , that spirit and the two others pranced about amid drumming , dancing , and wild excitement ( pages 386-7 ) . New missionary and government schools have tried to teach the children that the old ceremonies are only superstition and not to be taken seriously . In this they have not been successful . I am sure that the little boys of Beriten who chased the masks believed them to be real spirits . Success Breeds New Difficulties Also , the new schools have given rise to new problems . The Reverend Delmar Hesch , a boyish-looking missionary who had lived in the Asmat longer than any other Crosier father , spoke of them at his mission in Ajam . " Ajam has 1,000 people , and I think it 's the most progressive village in the Asmat , " he said . " We have the most successful cooperative and one of the best schools . At first everyone was enthusiastic about the new institutions ? too enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Perhaps we misled them . " Take the case of the children . The government insists they go to school through grade  | six , although I think grade three is far enough at the present time . So the children come out of school proud of their ability to read and write and do sums , and they want jobs in which they can use their skills . There are very few such jobs in all the Asmat . " Refusing to work with their hands , the children just hang around the village , creating all sorts of problems for their parents . It is a sad thing . " Wartime Plenty Brings a Strange Response As for the grown men , Father Hesch continued , the cooperative helps to take their minds off headhunting and provides them with a few luxuries . " But again , more was expected and did n't materialize . The men waited and waited . Finally their patience was exhausted , and at this point they were ready for a peculiarly South Pacific phenomenon , the cargo cult . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo cults . Primitive people , some of whom had never seen an outsider , looked on in amazement as ships and airplanes disgorged food , clothing , terrifying firearms , all sorts of things for which they quickly developed a desire . In New Guinea , villagers sometimes carved rough landing fields out of the jungle and waited for the great birds to fly to them with gifts . That was all the white strangers did , the people thought , except possibly to sit around and make marks on paper . We once saw a cargo-cult landing field with a replica of a radio aerial built beside it ; real airfields had such things , it was reasoned , so they must be necessary . Inevitably , cult leaders arose who promised the people not only manna from heaven , but also the ability to govern their own lives again . In the Asmat , one of the most ingenious of these lived in the village of Ewer . We saw him , a young crippled man with flashing eyes , in the crowd watching our plane come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Crosier missionary David Gallus . " He 's intelligent and shrewd , and he plays on the dislike of these people for governmental interference with their way of life . " A few months ago he began telling people he had the power to obtain airplanes and cans of food from a hole in the ground . If they went to church often and prayed hard and believed in him , he said , their skins would turn white , he would become president , and the Asmat would win freedom and independence . " Many believed , and gradually Father Callus 's church became filled at services . But the people stopped fishing and making sago . The cooperative ceased to function , and drums pounded every night . Then the village chief returned from a trip , discovered what was going on , and reported to the Indonesian authorities . " The local government head , the military commander , and the chief of police all came over here , " Father Gallus said . " They really scared the people . So , at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic Banner Flies Again When finally we left the Asmat to go home , we flew over the village of Ti , the place from which the people had fled when we approached in our canoe . This time only a few people ran away . The rest stood their ground . I wondered what they were thinking . Did they see in our little Cessna the long-awaited cargo plane ? Apparently not , for suddenly a band of men brought out a tattered flag , the one that had been planted before us on our first , tense visit to the village . The magic banner must have worked a second time : We flew away without harming the people of Ti . Legacy of a dead brother falls to Wek , a cane-braceleted tribesman of BasimWares . By Asmat tradition , the deceased 's home , possessions , and responsibilities are inherited by his next of kin , making Wek the head of two families . On the right , the brother 's widow and child now look to Wek for protection ; his own family sits at left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each maintaining a separate mud-floored hearth like the one behind Wek . The communal structures enable mothers to work while the aged mind the children . The government , however , encourages construction of one-family homes , and the larger dwellings may soon join a procession of Asmat traditions succumbing to the 20th century .
