THE BEAT GENERATION by Bruce Cook . 248 pages . Scribners. $6.95 . <P> For those who have learned to accept labels without questioning , the 1950s produced two generations in a single decade . There was the Silent Generation , so called for its members ' apparent shyness about anything that might jeopardize their future security . And there was the Beat Generation , which loudly ridiculed the values the quiet ones were so concerned about . Bruce Cook , the 39-year-old book-review editor of the National Observer , seems divided between the two . In mind and body he is with the Silents , but his heart belongs to the Beats . <P> The split is evident in his book , The Beat Generation-part sketchy sociology , part elementary lit. crit. , part personal reportage and part casual Ph.D . thesis . " The almost schizophrenic change that has been worked in the temper of our times , " Cook proclaims , " was predicted a decade before , implicit in every poem , novel and prose piece produced by the Beat Generation . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true and thoroughly misleading . It is not hard to find elements in Beat writing-or any other serious writing of the time-that predicted something as vague as " almost schizophrenic change " in " the temper of our times . " Allen Ginsberg , whose poem Howl is generally thought to have started the literary side of the movement , sang of devastated minds , mysticism and hallucinogenic drugs . Gregory Corso raged against authority , lamented the thinning of his wild hair and questioned the institution of marriage . Jack Kerouac 's On the Road bubbled about the transient life . Lawrence Ferlinghetti was charming about overpopulation , and obsession with the tyranny of drugs , governments and unspecified malevolence could be found in the work of even a marginal Beat like William S. Burroughs . <P> But as Cook knows , writers were dealing with those subjects generations before the Beats . He attempts to provide some historical perspective with a name here , an influence there . But mainly he depends on rhetoric , and it blows his subject out of all proportion : " No writer better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another-with such a keen sense of adventure . " This to describe Kerouac . But , even granting such a restricted distinction , any travel book by Sir Richard Burton , to name but one other writer , makes Kerouac 's sense of adventure seem like a pinball ricocheting in a glass-enclosed prison of lights and bells . <P> A Little Numb . In addition to Ginsberg ( and Kerouac ) , many of the people Cook interviewed-Kenneth Rexroth , Burroughs , Poets Robert Duncan and Michael McClure-make sensible distinctions between the Beats . In fact , the distinctions are so varied that the term " beat " means anything from tired blood to street existentialism to blissful cosmic consciousness .
