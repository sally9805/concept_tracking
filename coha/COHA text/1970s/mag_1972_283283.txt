DIRTY LITTLE BILLY <P> Directed by STAN DRAGOTI Screenplay by CHARLES MOSS and STAN DRAGOTI <P> From early sound epics featuring Johnny Mack Brown to Arthur Penn 's The Left-Handed Gun , there have been many attempts to dramatize either the inglorious life or the tarnished legend of William H. Bonney-otherwise known as Billy the Kid . Dirty Little Billy , however , is the first to deal with Billy while he is still literally a kid , a punk adolescent just learning to shoot , to booze , to whore and to stay up past midnight . Billy is an eager pupil . <P> Since Michael J. Pollard ( most familiar for his slow-witted C.W. Moss in Bonnie and Clyde ) holds down the title role , this movie is , alas , a Pollard vehicle . In fact , Pollard is physically right for the part , although with his bulbous cheeks and cretinous eyes , he looks a bit like Dopey . However , he acts more like all the Seven Dwarfs-simultaneously . Instead of directing him , Dragoti indulges him . Pollard either mopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of dialogue that he can not swallow entirely . There are some good secondary performances , though : by Charles Aidman as a sort of Babbitt aborning , Lee Purcell as a wilted prairie flower , and Dran Hamilton as Billy 's mother . Both women have the same blind strength of will , the same poignant sense of the hopelessness of their characters that transcends the hand-tooled mannerisms of the movie . <P> Everything is gray : the landscape , the light , the morality . There are no heroes , only villains and victims . The splendid myth of the West originated in blood and mud , both of which are in abundant evidence here , along with every other clich of what has come to be called the antiwestern . The action takes place mostly on the main street of Coffeyville , Kans. , which looks like a bayou . Whoever is not shot there is pretty sure to catch it in the saloon , which , like every other set in the picture , has been designed and dressed to look determinedly shabby . The actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all been wrestling in an anthracite pit . Their faces are ever so carefully caked with filth . Reality is swallowed up in such elaborately misplaced attention to detail ; the movie looks quite as fussy and phony in its ramshackle posturings as Shane did in its opulent mythologizing . <P> What is remarkable about Dirty Little Billy is the fervor with which its director has seized upon each thumping bromide of the anti-western and put them all on review , like a rodeo parade . Dragoti , formerly a director of television commercials , ought to have developed some expertise in manipulating an audience-but Dirty Little Billy , his first movie , is a shambling , enervating exercise . ?
