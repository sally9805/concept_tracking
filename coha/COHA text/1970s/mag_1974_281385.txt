France 's King Henri III first dropped in for dinner on March 4 , 1582 , and became a regular patron of the Parisian hostelry . Since Harry 's day , its habitues have ranged from musketeers to movie stars , presidents to prelates . Withal , La Tour d'Argent has remained one of the brightest , most tenacious stars in world gastronomy. * Kingdoms and republics have passed , boulevards and bridges have been renamed , heroes have risen and fallen-and been denied tables - but La Tour d'Argent has remained as immutable as its name , a tower of salivary silver . To this day , for any gourmet it towers high above Eiffel 's . <P> In Ma Tour d'Argent , a 515-page book about the restaurant to be published next month , Claude Terrail , its proprietor , makes clear that it is not quite the place for a Texas oilman in search of a sirloin and fries . Even Lyndon Johnson , then Vice President , was accorded a rather undistinguished table . Undaunted , he asked , " Do n't you serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed succulent anywhere on the premises , especially La Tour 's famous leg of lamb Claude Terrail and pressed ducks-of which the restaurant has served 468,800 since proprietors started taking count . <P> At Terrail 's Tour , the menu is not all that commands attention . As Sacha Guitry , the French playwright , observed , " You go to La Tour d'Argent to dine . Once there , you look " at the scene . Shirley Temple Black , unable to flag a cab on a rainy day , was conveyed to the restaurant by gallant gendarmes in a Black Maria . Terrail also relates that a distinguished Roman Catholic prelate , Monsignor Fernand Maillet , loved late dinners at La Tour . " As he was obliged by ecclesiastical rules to stop eating at midnight so that he could conduct early morning Mass , " Terrail says , " he was in the habit of turning his watch back an hour so that he could have a Sainte Genevive souffl . " An ardent addict is Ava Gardner , who once called the restaurant at 11 p.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if she could have dinner . " Certainement , " said Terrail , who proceeded to cook her a steak . " It was the worst I 've ever had , " Ava said . The late Winthrop Rockefeller , who liked to dine on Terrail 's homard 1'Amricaine and Pouilly Fuiss , once humbly asked le patron if he would accept a personal check for his meal . Novelist James Jones asked Terrail to cash his check for $1 million . " I 'm short of cash , " said the owner , " but I 'll open a charge account for you . "
