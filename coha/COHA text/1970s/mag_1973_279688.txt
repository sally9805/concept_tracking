Many babies are " jaundiced " in the first few days of life , but usually the yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes disappears quickly as the liver adjusts to its new metabolic work load . William Lewis , born last Oct. 10 in New York City , was a rare example of a far more serious condition . His complexion remained abnormal . Even more frightening , his stools and urine indicated that he suffered from an inborn defect , biliary atresia-the absence or severe underdevelopment of tiny bile ducts emerging from the liver . William 's case proved to be unusual in another respect : he was flown to Japan in the search for lifesaving corrective surgery . <P> Nature designed the ducts to carry bile on its way from the liver , where it is made , to the duodenum , where it aids in digestion . Among the estimated 200 occurrences each year of biliary atresia in the U.S. , there are a few in which ducts outside the liver are large enough for corrective surgery . But not in William 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon cause irreparable damage to that vital organ and affect others . The prognosis , at one of Manhattan 's most famed university hospitals , was grim . Although operations for biliary atresia are performed in the U.S. , the experts concluded that William 's condition could not be corrected by surgery and that he probably would live no longer than nine months . <P> But his parents , Mina and Brian Lewis , refused to accept the sentence of death . They consulted Dr. Orvar Swenson , a noted pediatric surgeon at Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago . He , too , was pessimistic . He recalled , without recommending it , a modified operation devised by a Japanese surgeon , Dr. Keijiro Suruga , who reported that it had succeeded in some cases . Mina Lewis did some research of her own and found a new article by Suruga in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery . Then , using her experience as a travel agent , she quickly arranged a family trip to Tokyo in early January . <P> At Juntendo University , Suruga , 52 , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is far more common in Asia than in Western countries . Suruga 's early techniques for correcting the condition proved to be only palliative , not curative . In 1968 he hit upon a method that he has since used in 40 cases , with 30 children now surviving . It was a variation of this technique that he used for William . <P> The child had one thing in his favor : he was less than 90 days old and his liver so far had suffered relatively little damage . As Suruga explained , after three months the backed-up bile is likely to cause irremediable cirrhosis of the liver . Another factor was most unfavorable : the bile ducts in the liver were the tiniest imaginable-averaging only one five-hundredth of an inch in diameter . Suruga is not hopeful unless they are twice that size , but he nevertheless decided to make the attempt .
