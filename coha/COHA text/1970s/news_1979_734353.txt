Of all our myths , the most dangerous is that in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 we followed a policy of wise firmness and determination . In view of the current furor about Soviet troops in Cuba , and the heated rhetoric that would pledge us to the same policy we followed in 1962 , let me restate what actually happened then . In 1962 we already had our missiles in Turkey , which borders the Soviet Union , and the Soviets began placing their missiles in Cuba , 90 miles from our border . We had lied to the Soviet Union about our U-2 spy flights from Turkey and our organizing and equipping an invasion of Cuba , and the Soviets had lied to us about placing their missiles in Cuba . We talked about our Monroe Doctrine , and they talked about their duty to protect the socialist community . If we had thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United Nations with rights equal to ours , there would have been no hysteria , no panic , no ultimatum Sanitation Workers In Action ? Sort of To the Editor : Edward Ostrowski , president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association , assures us in his Aug. 31 letter that " the city 's sanitation workers take pride in their work and want New York City to be clean ... but the city ... places stumbling blocks in their way . " Although there is no doubt that the hardships and frustrations under which our santitationmen labor are severe , I wonder if Mr. Ostrowski has observed them as they proudly attend to the swift completion of their appointed rounds . I have , frequently , and I regret to say that the following incident is pretty typical of what I see : On Tuesday , Aug. 28 , about midnight , a Sanitation Department truckstopped at the northeast corner of 57th Street and Seventh Avenue . A sanitation worker hopped out , picked up the trash can on the corner and emptied it , more or less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the truck , he managed to spill about one-third of the content , leaving a little trail of garbage along Seventh Avenue , somewhat as a raccoon might do if there were raccoons on Seventh Avenue . The sanitation worker then jumped back into the truck , which proceeded merrily on its way , ignoring ( as is the custom these days ) the red light as well as the overflowing trash basket on the northwest corner of 57th Street and Seventh Avenue . Or does the Uniformed Sanitationmen 's Association insist on separate collection for northwest corners ? NAOMI GRAFFMAN New York , Aug. 31 , 1979 Shortcuts to Cash To the Editor : The cost of borrowing money from banks and the rate of bank holdups in New York have reached " unprecedented " and " alarming " levels . The prime rate is more than double what had long been the limit beyond which the lender was guilty of usury . Is it subversive to suggest that this is more than mere coincidence ? As the banks make it more costly to do legitimate business with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternate method to arrange their financing . HOWARD N. MEYER Rockville Centre , L.I. , Sept. 7,1979 To the Editor : It is impossible to deal with inflation unless we at least try to understand what the forces are that are building up our stock of money at such a rapid rate that the value of money with respect to goods and services appears to be falling . As money depreciates , we instinctively try to acquire tangibles that we are sure must have real , useable values . Real values , yes , but not values that can be reflected correctly in our rapidly depreciating money . Supposedly sensible people are suggesting that we need to fix the prices of commodities as well as wage rates . Nothing could be more unfair or less likely to correct the price disparities from which we are all suffering . What we need to do is , on the one hand , to check the supply of money for purposes that produce neither goods nor services that can be consumed or used . By increasing the demand for real things such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the value , of all homes and creating a demand for more inflated money in order to finance sales and resales at constantly rising prices . People are being told to " save " instead of spend . By putting up the interest rate , our supposed financial experts are making matters worse by checking production and putting a premium on the use of money just to get more money . Exorbitant interest rates create " false " savings as well as and no crisis . There was a crisis because , in spite of our claims to recognize the Soviet Union and Cuba as sovereign states , we were really thinking of them as robbers and ourselves as cops . So we sent them an ultimatum : Agree to remove your missiles from Cuba within 24 hours , unilaterally and unconditionally , or we will bomb them . At the same time we acknowledged that such bombing would begin a nuclear war that would end the human world . This is literally and precisely what Robert Kennedy emphasized in " Thirteen Days , " his memoir about the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first page he refers to it as " a confrontation which brought the world to the abyss of nuclear destruction and the end of mankind . " He likewise emphasized that President Kennedy did not expect the Soviets to obey the ultimatum . After delivering it to the Soviet Ambassador , he writes ( p. 109 ) , " I returned to the White House . The President was not optimistic , nor was I. He had not abandoned hope , but what Save Our Bottles To the Editor : Other states in our nation are taking forward steps to clean up the litter of beer bottles and soda cans , but we in New York must still walk through the daily accumulation left by street drinkers and automobile tossers . Last December , Michigan , an industrial state like ours , initiated a bottle bill . Visiting Iowa this summer , I was delighted to find that it has just begun to control such containers , joining Oregon , Vermont and South Dakota . I have too often heard the argument that a beverage container deposit law will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to stop drinking . Such a law will simply bring us clean public areas and conservation of valuable resources , not economic damage . Let 's get out front on this , New York , where we usually are , and should certainly be . RICHARD V. GILBERTSON Brooklyn , Sept. 4 , 1979 To the Editor : As an Englishwoman married to an American and living in the United States , I would be most obliged if I could bring to the attention of your readers , particularly your British readers , a most distressing event that will soon take place in Britain . The British Government , under the leadership of Mrs. Thatcher , is about to revise the immigration laws of the U.K. The new rules will still permit British men to bring their foreign wives and children to the U.K. as a matter of right but would deny this same right to British women who may attract an excess of ordinary savings . The real task of money , is to measure the real value of goods and services produced and exchanged for consumption by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to realize how rapidly we have been increasing all forms of debt both public and private . Unfortunately , our income-tax laws have had a very inflationary effect . Interest is a deductible expense before taxes . But there is no deduction for amortization . So we are continually putting off our responsibility for liquidating debt . Furthermore , by increasing interest rates , we make it seem attractive to let debt increase . We also have a trick which is to sell debts as sources of more income . In such ways , we continue to inflate money , making it worth less and less . We can not check inflation until the public wakes up to an understanding of the harm that ignorance is allowing the public to inflict upon itself . ARTHUR C. HOLDEN Washington , Conn. , Aug. 27 , 1979 hope there was now rested with Khrushchev 's revising his course within the next few hours . It was a hope , not an expectation . The expectation was a military confrontation by Tuesday and possibly tomorrow . " In one sentence , possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Kennedy reports , like a warning from the grave ( his memoir was published only after his death ) , what President Kennedy expected to follow from nuclear war with the Soviet Union : " The thought that disturbed him the President the most , and that made the prospect of war much more fearful than it would otherwise have been , was the specter of the death of the children of this country and all the world ? the young people who had no role , who had no say , who knew nothing even of the confrontation , but whose lives would be snuffed out like everyone else 's " ( p. 106 ) . These are documented facts ? surely the most important ones ? about the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 . Do they add up to a policy of " wise firmness and determination " ( the myth ) or to a panic reaction in which the annihilation of the entire human world was deliberately risked and actually expected ? Doomsday did not happen then only because we were " lucky , " as Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put it in an article on May 12 , 1972 , in The New York Times . That is , the Soviets unexpectedly obeyed the ultimatum . When the Washington leaders of today get hot under their collars about a few thousand Soviet troops in Cuba , they would do well to remember not only the tens of thousands of American troops closer to the Soviet Union and its socialist allies than Cuba is to us , but also the facts rather than the myth of the original Cuban missile crisis . JOHN SOMERVILLE El Cajon , Calif. , Sept. 6 , 1979 The writer is a professor of philosophy emeritus at the City University of New York . Long Conrail Rides To the Editor : I read Conrail chairman Edward Jordan 's Aug. 29 letter , " Conrail Points the Way to a Healthy U.S. Rail System , " over and over again . I was on a Conrail train that had left Newark gat 8:40 A.M. and finally arrived in New York at 10:02 . Two days before , my 8:55 arrival was delayed until 11:05 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 15 years . This past year , the service has deteriorated to the point of being ludicrous . Thousands of man-hours are lost to New York corporations . The stress and strain on the passengers and their families could never be calculated . I would strongly suggest that Mr. Jordan spend some time with his commuters ; then he would resign in shame . E. J. SHAUGHNESSY North Plainfield , N.J. , Aug. 29,1979 want to live in the U.K. with their foreign husbands and children . The ostensive purpose of this is to prevent what the Government thinks is the common practice of British women , usually non-white women : entering " marriages of convenience " with non-citizens from the Indian subcontinent . The new rules would therefore not only be blatantly racialist in character but also anti-feminist in the extreme . Further , they assume that only women and not men can be seduced by the wiles of the opposite sex or that only women and not men would sell themselves for a price in order to gain a certain end . For the record , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , of which a mere 3,068 were from the Indian subcontinent . During that same year approximately 9,500 foreign wives settled in Britain . Because of Britain 's membership in the E.E.C. , a German woman , say , with her Indian husband can as a matter of right enter and live in the U.K. But I , as a nativeborn Englishwoman , do not have that same right with my American husband . Britain was long a battlefield whereon the basic political rights of women were fought for and won and which served as an example to other nations . How ironic and lamentable is it then that a woman who because of these past victories attained the highest political position is now the leader of a government that intends with one fell swoop to diminish severely these hard-won gains . I hope this latest attempt by a British government to deny its female citizens basic rights of citizenship that are taken for granted in all civilized and democratic countries can be thwarted . E. B. MANDELBEnG Kew Gardens , N.Y. , Sept. 1 , 1979    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
