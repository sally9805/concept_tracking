JUST BEFORE NIGHTFALL <P> Directed and Written by CLAUDE CHABROL <P> Forgiveness is almost a matter of etiquette , bestowed casually among members of polite society . <P> Absolution , even for murder , is easy : it is practically a social grace . <P> Feeling guilty is a faux pas , like hiring the wrong decorator or choosing an inappropriate wine for dinner . <P> This is the upper middle class of French society , portrayed here by Claude Chabrol with harrowing humor , and its overriding principle is that no shock waves are tolerated . Just Before Nightfall , an intelligent and wholly unsparing dark comedy , concerns an advertising executive named Charles ( Michel Bouquet ) who murders his mistress . Charles discovers-as did Hickey , under rather more intense circumstances in O'Neill 's The Iceman Cometh-that what is insupportable is the weight of pardon . <P> Act of Passion . Charles has made the mistake of committing a crime in a milieu where nothing much matters . He himself remains largely dead to the world , so that when he strangles his mistress ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult initially to determine whether the killing was an accident or an unaccustomed act of passion . He is rather gloomy afterward , as his best friend Franois ( Franois Perier ) duly notes . But Charles barely manages a look of concern when Franois hears that his wife has met with an " accident . " It is Franois 's wife who was Charles ' mistress . Charles sits uneasily at home , toying with his dinner , forcing himself to eat dessert and play a game of Scrabble with his wife and children . He even has to take several drops of laudanum to sleep . <P> The seriousness of his situation rests with ever-increasing firmness on Charles ' modishly tailored shoulders . On the way to his dead mistress 's funeral , he silently mouths a confession in the back seat of a car . A police inspector confides to him that the murder may never be solved . With mounting distress , Charles tells his wife ( Stphane Audran ) about his affair and the killing . She considers these revelations and is understanding . He tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one , " Franois explains , " is guilty of what happens in a nightmare . " After all this , Charles can turn only to the police . It would not be fair to the pitiless symmetry Chabrol has established to reveal what happens after this point , but the film ends with a fine , fierce flourish . <P> Just Before Nightfall is among the very best of Chabrol 's movies . It is cunning and deadly , made with a measured simplicity of style which suits the ruefully ironic rigors of the theme . Attempts to delineate a sort of arctic moral climate , to deal with shallow people and the deadness of lives , frequently end up either being superficial themselves or strangling on their own rage . Chabrol 's particular achievement here is his ability to keep his distance and still preserve his passion . <P> Jay Cocks
