Olympic Champ John Curry turns old sport into new art <P> I am a skater . " says John Curry firmly . " I believe that the word skater has the same value as the word dancer . " In fact , Curry is both an ice skater who dances and a ballet dancer who ice skates . The title of his new show , which opened at Manhattan 's Felt Forum last week : Ice Dancing . <P> By whatever name it goes , however , Curry 's show , which includes twelve other talented skater-dancers , is one of the most sumptuous treats of this year 's holiday season , two hours of fascinating movement and sometimes astonishing beauty . It is at once brand new , perhaps even pioneering , and reassuringly familiar , the combination of two long-established disciplines to create something strikingly fresh and original . <P> Curry , 29 , an Englishman who won the gold medal for men 's figure skating at the 1976 Olympics , was inevitably offered high-paying jobs by various ice shows . He turned them all down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to criticize them , " he told a reporter , " but I feel they are an antiquated form of entertainment . When I go to see ice shows , I do n't actually see much skating . What I see is a lot of spectacle , a lot of camouflage , a lot of substitution , and very little of the real thing . " What Curry wants to see is " a skater who draws a pattern of music in the air . " The spectator should , he believes , " stop seeing the steps , the effort behind it all , and start seeing that it 's a physical representation of the music . " <P> To construct the kind of ice show he envisioned . Curry choreographed two numbers himself and invited eight choreographers from the dance world - Peter Martins , Twyla Tharp , Norman Maen , Kenneth MacMillan , Jean-Pierre Bonnefous , Donald Saddler , Douglas Norwick and Robert Cohan - to do the others . He would explain what a skater could technically do , and they proceeded from there , excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an ordinary dance floor . " John is showing that it 's possible to do something on ice that 's never been done before , " is the enthusiastic comment of Bonnefous , one of the lead dancers of the New York City Ballet . <P> On occasion the hardboard choreographers show their unfamiliarity with Curry 's medium , and a few of the numbers are hesitant and uncertain . Tharp 's After All , which features Curry alone , seems curiously stilted , and Saddler 's turn-of-the-century Palais de Glace , which involves the whole company , verges on the kind of ice spectacle Curry disdains.
