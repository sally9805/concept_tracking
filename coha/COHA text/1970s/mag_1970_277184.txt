There has been no global bloodletting in the years since World War II , but-almost as if by some law of compensation - internal strife has risen to an extraordinary degree . Old claims and ancient grievances , seemingly long forgotten in modern nation-states , flared up with greater virulence than ever . <P> Constitutional guarantees of civil rights were suspended in Canada last week after French separatists kidnaped officials to dramatize their claim for sovereignty . The southern tip of Italy barricaded itself against the rest of the country to assert a historical fealty to its traditional capital . Northern Ireland continued to smolder among its centuries-old religious hatreds . These and countless other . ' atavistic conflicts are now waged with the newest weapons . <P> By comparison last week , the U.S. seemed peaceful despite its own recent bitter past of violence . The strife elsewhere was a reminder that America 's special gift , and the nation 's very meaning , is bound up with an ability to subdue tribal turmoil and to homogenize ( if not harmonize ) a diverse society .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
