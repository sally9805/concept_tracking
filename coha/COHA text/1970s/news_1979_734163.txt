txt Sheikh Muhammed , the wandering Bedouin , is more excited than anyone can remember . He has suddenly hoisted an Egyptian flag ( who cares if the eagle is the wrong color ? ) , put new batteries in his transistor radio , and mounted a round-the-clock vigil between El Arish 's desert palms and a lapping Mediterranean . " I am waiting for peace , " he says . He has barely a month left to wait . This dusty Sinai capital of 35,000 ? whose 11 years of Israeli occupation have not visibly short-circuited a life cycle of work , banter , thick coffee , and snoozing ? is about to take an unlikely center  --  stage role in Middle East history . Israel , which rumbled in on its blitz to the Suez Canal in the 1967 war against Egypt , is pulling out . Egypt 's President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin are coming here in late May to make it official . Then , for the first time since the violent birth of the Jewish state 31 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something other than tanks and troop carriers . " Of course , I 'm glad to leave , " said an Israeli officer as his men dismantled a metal-frame supply shed in preparation for the pullout , now expected May 25 . " Leaving means there will be peace here . Staying means no peace . " Not everyone in El Arish , particularly among the town 's roughly 10,000 Palestinian refugees and hundreds of encamped Bedouins , is convinced things are that simple . The Palestinians seem glad to see Israel go . But some also appear to feel President Sadat has regained desert sand ? " Animals do n't even live here , " one Palestinian said with only slight exaggeration ? at the expense of the Palestinian call for self-determination on the more hospitable soil of Jordan 's occupied West Bank . The Bedouins , for their part , fear they now may have trouble crossing into Israel , where they have been making more money than they had ever imagined ? up to 350 Israeli pounds ( about $17 ) daily ? picking fruit . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace . And the native Egyptians ? that is to say , most of El Arish // From page 1 El Arish is counting the days to peace ? there are no second thoughts . " Even if there are problems with peace , " says a vendor on the town 's dusty , deserted main street , " peace is better than war . And being Egyptians , real Egyptians , again is better than having Israel here . " Memory of war persists Economically , El Arish hopes to lurch forward by stepping backward ? to biblical times , when the town thrived as a caravan stop between the Holy Land and the Nile . The Israeli occupation brought money , something the Egyptians seem singularly to lack . " But prices have gone up , too , " the shopkeeper laments . " We pay more for things than Cairo . . . . Besides , with peace we can sell to both Israelis and Egyptians . " Portents of peace , meanwhile , vie with the ineradicable memory of war . Near the water 's edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just outside town , a rusty , riddled train ? an Egyptian ammunition transport , the Israelis say ? lies amid decaying shells under a ? thickening overcoat of sand . But Egyptian flags suddenly flutter from dozens of balconies or , in miniature , from taxi antennas . A cafe in the center of town has posted pictures of Messrs . Sadat , Begin , and President Carter . ? Due east , down a dusty road from the main ocean drive toward pre-1967 Israel , youngsters give some of El Arish 's small but productive fishing fleet a fresh coat of paint . " We 'll be painting again in a month , " one teen-ager can not help adding ? to strike out Hebrew-numeral license markings . Arabic with a Hebrew accent Still , no one seems sure precisely what peace ? something Arabs and Israelis have known only in rare spurts over the past three decades ? will mean in the long run . The town 's few smallish hostelries may well give way to full-scale hotels , to cash in on the attractive combination of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Israel by an 11-year troop presence , the changes may be slow , subtle , and largely symbolic . Local fishermen already sell part of their catch to Israel . Knee-high Palestinian refugees , born under occupation , speak Arabic with a Hebrew accent . The town cafe peddles Coca-Cola , blacklisted in some Arab countries for the company 's dealings with Israel . But the specifics may not matter much , to hear Muhammed the Bedouin tell it . In a break with the seMinomad 's traditional resignation that was surely prompted by his small , orange radio , Muhammed insists that Mr. Sadat has opened a hew page in Middle East history ? no matter what happens . As soon as Egypt and Israel signed their treaty in March , Muhammed and a handful of fellow Bedouins huddled under a makeshift desert shelter just outside town and began waiting for the Egyptian leader to show up . " I do n't want to talk about 1967 , I do n't even want to think about it , " Muhammed said . " That is all in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything ? Muhammed paused , shrugged , and added a perfunctory : " Inshallah , " or " God willing " in Arabic .
