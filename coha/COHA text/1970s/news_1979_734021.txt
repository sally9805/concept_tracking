txt Teng Hsiao-ping , who is using his trip to the United States to dramatize China 's eagerness for advanced technology , climbed into the cockpit of a space shuttle flight simulator here today to discover what it would be like to land this newest American spacecraft from an altitude of 100,000 feet . China 's senior Deputy Prime Minister seemed to be so fascinated by the experience that he went through a second landing and even then seemed reluctant to leave the simulator , which is designed to reproduce the sights and sounds of space flight . Mr. Teng 's enthusiastic impersonation of an astronaut was the high point of a three-hour tour of the Johnson Space Center , which he visited after flying this morning from Atlanta to Ellington Air Force Base here . Houston , where he will stay for two days , is the second stop of a cross-country tour that will end in Seattle on Monday . Politicians Appear Nervous Texas politicians have been jittery about appearing to get too close to the 74-year-old Mr. Teng and thereby seeming to endorse President Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government on Taiwan . For instance , Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen , a Democrat , had originally been scheduled to accompany Mr. Teng on his flight here , but then let it be known that he had a previous commitment in Waxahachie , Tex . But both William P. Clements , the new Republican Governor , and Mayor Jim McConn were on hand to give the Chinese leader an enthusiastic welcome to what the Mayor described as " the golden buckle of the sun belt . " Mr. Teng 's visit to Atlanta seemed to produce maximum local impact and foster the impression of a peaceloving China doing business with this country , and especially its southern states . " Teng Bids for Sun Belt 's Aid , " said the banner headline in this morning 's Atlanta Constitution , which devoted almost seven pages to the Chinese leader 's visit . On arrival , Mr. Teng underscored the commercial opportunities he hopes to find here , describing Houston as a " center of the petroleum industry , " and declaring his eagerness to " learn about your advanced experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will spend two hours at the Hughes Tool Company , a major producer of offshore drilling equipment , which China has been buying here for several years . Tonight , he traveled to Simonton , Tex. , for a rodeo and barbecue worthy of a political campaign swing , which is what his tour increasingly resembles . But for Mr. Teng himself , the most memorable moment in Texas may be the one in the space shuttle . He seemed thoroughly pleased and absorbed as he settled a pilot 's earphones on his head and listened to Fred Haise , a veteran astronaut who put him through the paces of his simulated orbital flight . " We 're supersonic now and we 're at about three times the speed of sound , " the astronaut said . As soon as this was interpreted , Mr. Teng nodded vigorously . Through the window of the cockpit , he had a view of the curvature of the earth , the Pacific Ocean and the California coast , all projected by a computer-operated television system . He leaned forward when Mr. Haise pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button to let down the spacecraft 's landing gear after the astronaut explained // that it would be going into a 20-degree dive for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California . As the runway appeared in the cockpit 's window , Mr. Teng raised both hands in a gesture of wonder and his face broadened into perhaps the largest smile his visit has yet produced . No one has yet taken the flight that was simulated for Mr. Teng . The first space shuttle is now being assembled for a test flight scheduled for November . On his tour of the Space Center , Mr. Teng asked no questions of his guides from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration until he reached a fullscale Skylab training model whose features were pointed out to him by Alan Bean , an astronaut who spent 59 days aboard the second Skylab . Mr. Bean pointed to a window through which , he said , he had sometimes seen Shanghai . The visitor shook his head in amazement . Then , with attention to the practical details of life , Mr. Teng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sleeping quarters . Mr. Teng then wanted to know whether space flight affected bowel movements . He was equally interested in the details of how the astronauts fed themselves and what they did with their garbage . At a luncheon after his tour , he was presented with photographs of the earth taken from the moon when the eastern hemisphere was in view . China , it was explained , was covered by clouds . Secretary of Energy James R. Schlesinger , who accompanied Mr. Teng to Houston , was asked at the Space Center about China 's oil potential . He said the reserves could be immense , on the order of those in the United States , and that the Chinese were eager for American assistance in their exploration effort . At a later stage , Mr. Schlesinger predicted , China might also seek American involvement in developing their production . Mr. Teng 's official visit has now lasted five days . This was the first on which he did not warn of the menace of " hegemony , " meaning the Soviet Union .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
