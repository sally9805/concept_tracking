ALTERNATING CURRENT <P> by OCTAVIO PAZ 215 pages . Viking . $7.95 . <P> The more flamboyant political leaders of Latin America-the Fidel Castros , the Che Guevaras-are familiar to the point of cartoonist 's cliches . But what does the ordinary North American citizen and/or reader know of Latin American cultural leaders ? For instance : Octavio Paz , Mexico 's foremost poet and essayist-hardly a North American household name . <P> Paz , 58 , is not an apolitical man . <P> Like other modern poets ( the Frenchman St.-John Perse , the Greek George Seferis ) , he has made a career as a professional diplomat . He was Mexico 's Ambassador to India when he resigned from the diplomatic service for , in fact , the most political of reasons-to protest the killing of Mexican university students by soldiers and police in October 1968 . <P> Yet Paz states flatly : " The Third World needs not so much political leaders , a common species , as something far more rare and precious : critics . " The essays he has collected here may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's priorities . The author once wrote a literary want ad describing the need for " an Indonesian Swift or an Arab Voltaire . " He pretty well fills that job himself . <P> To Paz , the Third World is not simply a political or economic concept but a psychological state , consisting of " madmen , " " lovers " and , of course , poets as well as " colored peoples " and ex-colonials . Essayist Paz regards " revolt " as " the form of our age , " above all for the Third World . But his notion of revolt , being cultural rather than political , broadly defines itself as the impulse " to give otherness a place in historical life . " <P> Paz 's Third World comes close to being a metaphysical entity : that element in humanity which has not yet been machined down by technology and bureaucracy , though it may very well want to be . The Third World , he writes , " wavers between Buddha and Marx , Siva and Darwin , Allah and cybernetics . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and machines ; it is also a determination to be modern . " Paz concedes the course of events . " The Third World is condemned to modernity and the task confronting us is not so much to escape this fate as to discover a less inhuman form of conversion . " <P> " Imagination " and " soul " are words that occur again and again in these essays . They are still alive , if not always well , in the Third World , Paz believes , and his primary concern is to save them . In his quest for allies he ranges far and wide . He examines fellow Latin American artists like Pablo Neruda ( whom he calls " a poetic continent " ) and the film maker Luis Bunuel ( whom he compares to Goya ) . He looks to Marshall McLuhan , then looks away from him - as a " prophet , " alas , only of Madison Avenue .
