Throughout his life H.L. Mencken must have typed or dictated 100,000 letters . Most were short , on the half sheets which became his hallmark . Many were filled with what he liked to call his " malicious animal magnetism . " Mencken was at his most prolific and exuberant in the years from 1914 to 1933 . He became a coeditor of the Smart Set magazine in 1914 , at the age of thi ... y-f our , and , in 1925 , a founding editor of the American Mercury . The letters published here date mainly from that period . These were the years when . Meneken was reaching the peak of his success , when he was , professionally and personally , happier than he would ever be again . Even as an adolescent Meneken preferred typing to writing longhand . He started modestly with his father 's old upright Remington , graduated to a tiny Corona which he pounded during his long heyday , and went on to a Remington portable noiseless which he broke in at the national political conventions of 1932 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the work . Since he rarely made carbons of his letters , many of those which survive were transcribed from his secretaries ' notebooks . The preservation of many others ( more than 8,000 ) was accomplished by the historian Julian Boyd , who. while librarian at Princeton , collected and microfilmed letters from Meneken 's chief correspondents . The following letters , together with their accompanying notes , have been selected and adapted from The New Mencken Letters , edited by Carl Bode , professor of American literature at the University of Maryland , author of a biography of Mencken , and editor of The Young Mencken , a compilation of Meneken 's early writings . The book will be published by Dial in October . TO THEODORE DREISER /December 20 ? , 1916/ Dear Dreiser : ? Despite all your honeyed eloquence , I still think it rotten politics to come out with a play on sexual perversion at such a time . Think how the moral reviewers will fall upon it , and bellow , DI told you so . " Really , the enterprise is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything . Worse , your play is a very bad one . The sexual perversion will appear to be dragged in by the heels ? a mere effort to be nasty . Such strikes for liberty of discussion do not interest me . If you had anything to say on the subject , Pd be for saying it . But you actually say nothing . Cut out the scandalous interest , and there is no interest left . Fully half of the signers of the Protest , painfully seduced into signing by all sorts of artifices , will demand that their names be taken off . You fill me with ire . I damn you in every European language . You have a positive genius for doing foolish things . Put the ms. behind the clock , and thank me and God for saving you from a mess . Also , avoid Reno as you would the great pox while the case is on . Imagine the headlines when you come to trial . In brief , apply to this business the elementary reasoning powers of a streptococcus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , my chaplain advises me to promise nothing . For such a disease as you show the most violent remedies are indicated by the pharmacopoeia . A big dose , filling the patient to the gills-down , down she goes ! St. Barnabas , what a taste ! But it will do you good , my dear Mon Chair . Almost I grow moral . Change your play into something else . Jack the Ripper is an old , old storya shilling shocker these many years . Read it in cold blood . Take the advice of men with hair on their chests-not of women . Leave it to anyone you choose-Huneker , or Wilkinson , or Masters . This is my sober , honest judgment : The play is a piece of pish-clumsy , banal , unnatural , almost idiotic . Its publication would lose you your case , forfeit the respect of all intelligent persons , and make every man who has labored on the protest look like an ass . This I verily believe . Call me an ass an thou wilt , but you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show this letter to Wilkinson , and then let him read the play-or vice versa . If you pull any stuff about the morals of Baltimore , I 'll have you killed within ten days . Yours in Xt. , Do n't forget that we meet on the 27th . The place : Michow 's beer-rooms . The time : 7 p.m . Bring the fair Gloom . I sail on the 28th . Done by me , etc . Theodore Dreiser and Mencken corresponded from 1907 until Dreiser 's death , in 1945 . Mencken emerged as the heartiest champion that Dreiser the author had ; on the oth er hand , lie soon decided that Dreiser had the social habits of a tomcat . Dreiser for his part deeply appreciated Mencken ' a battles on his behalf but also came to consider him a scold . Most of their correspondence has survived , though not all . The play in question was The Hand of the Potter . Its celltral character , young Isidore Berchansky , rapes and then murders an eleven-year-old girl . Huneker , or Wilkinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huneker ; the British novelist Louis Wilkinson , then in this country ; and Edgar Lee Masters , who the year before had published Spoon River Anthology . They were all known for the breadth of their ap ? predation . Avoid Reno : Dreiser was toying with the idea of a divorce from his infinitely patient wife . The fair Gloom : Estelle Bloom Kubitz , nicknamed " Gloom " by her sister Marion because of her love for gloom ) Russian novels , had recently become Theodore Dreiser ' s secretary .

Dear Dreiser : Pondering my letter of last night , I become full of fears that I did not make its objections to the play strong enough . If you have any such feeling , please add 40% to every adjective and 100% to those that seem the weakest . I had rather see you sold into white slavery at once than have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Comstocks would be wholly beyond expression . They would fix upon you forever the reputation of a man who dealt in the most unmentionable indecencies and your goose would be cooked . If the play must be printed , then for God 's sake get Ella Wheeler Wilcox or Dr. Frank Crane to sign it . You are the one man in America to-day who can not afford to monkey with such dangerous buzz-saws . For all you and I can say to the contrary , this is still a great moral republic , and there is plainly such a thing as tempting its pious sentiment too far . Seriously , the only feasible course is to print the play under a nom de plume and then acknowledge it after the row is over . But you will never acknowledge it . Two years hence , reading it in cold blood , you will rank it with that early book of yours which now stands suppressed but is read with gloating by occasional visitors to the Congressional Library . I inclose you a tract appropriate to the season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours , M Ella Wheeler Wilcox , then sixty-six , was one of the most popular and most moralistic bad poets of her era . Dr. Frank Crane was a Methodist minister turned journalist and the author of such books as God and Democracy ( 1911 ) . TO THEODORE DREISER H MENCK.E1 ? 524 NOLL ... 15 5T BALT MORE Dec. 22 , 1916 . Dear , Dreiser : I am still full of fears that I adopted a too suave and conciliatory tone in my letters about the play . Please destroy them forthwith . I shall give you my verdict through a megaphone when we meet . Whenever I take a pen in hand I immediately grow artificial and ineffective . Yours , Even this note was not enough . Dreiser immediately rebutted with what Mencken termed , in his long answer the day after , " Your eloquent arguments in favor of the high artistic purpose and noble intent of your play . " Dreiser added ? and this stung ? that Mencken was a moralist . Despite all his cutting and slashing , Mencken triumphed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . It was not till 1919 that Dreiser managed to get The Hand of the Potter printed , and not till 1921 that he got it produced . It was a failure on both occasions . In June 1919 after collecting 122 rejection slips from all over , Fitzgerald had finally sold a story ? to the Smart Set . It was " Babes in the Woods , " and Mencken put it in the August issue . Now , less than a year later , Mencken was complimenting the author of This Side of Paradise , a book about to be hailed by many reviewers as the novel of the year . He added his own praise in the Smart Set for August 1920 . TO EDNA FERRER The charming if brash Miss Ferber had gravitated from Milwaukee to Chicago and was living there when she first wrote to Mencken in September 1920 . He found her short stories and novels more than readable . A hock : a toast .

Accordingly , I suggest that you come down by the Congressional on Saturday the 11th and do me the honor of visiting my humble abode . Crabs will be on the table , mountain high , and there will be some of the best beer you ever tasted . This brew , indeed , almost makes me weep . It is the noblest , by far , ever broached in my house ? a full-bodied semi-Dunkles , not too bitter and yet not too sweet , running about 5% of ethyl alcohol by volume . I shall reserve 30 bottles for you . The rest of the brethren will have to drink my usual beer . Do n't say that you are busy . The girls surely must take their baths on Saturday night .

I 'll send her a bottle of that Virginia Dare wine and a copy of the Ladies ' Home Journal to entertain her while you are getting soused . Yours , M Mencken enclosed a clipping which read : " London , Aug. 3 . ? The following statement was issued today at Buckingham Palace . " ' The king commands that the court shall wear mourning for one week for the late Hon. Warren Gamaliel Harding , President of the ' United Slates . The period of mourning shall commence from this date . ' " King George sent a message of condolence to Mrs. Harding . " TO SARA HAARDT Baltimore , October 8 , 1923 Dear Miss Haardt : - My conscience troubles me about letting a Refined Woman tote moonshine through the streets of a great Christian city . Could n't I call for you , conceal the jugs in my baggage , and then make off with you to the wop 's studio ? If not , where shall we meet and when ? I spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptists , one of them a judge . The local gentry turned out Saturday night to drink us under the table , but when the smoke cleared away all save four or five of them were dead on the field of honor . A great place for eating and drinking , but I only saw one pretty gal , she was a New Yorker . A sad scene . The native Junker ca n't keep up their estates , so all the best land is falling into the hands of profiteers from the North and West . For posterity Mencken put a note on the transcription of the letter , saying that the moonshine was some Alabama corn liquor which Sara Haardt had smuggled in for him from her home in Montgomery , where she was spending her summer vacation . The wop 's studio : Marconi 's Restaurant . Junker : gentry . TO SARA BAARDT Baltimore , January 30 , 1925 Dear Sara : - I have just escaped from New York . I went out to Mt . Vernon ( N.Y. ) by motor last night with Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his amiable , industrious and beautiful wife had a Stokes ' Liniment cocktail ready for us , and we thawed out in ten minutes . At one time I feared that the wind would blow the machine into the Harlem river . Such are the perils of life in that great city . At noon there was a vast literary lunch for Sherwood Anderson . Had I known what a jam there was to be I should have come down with the ager and got off . All the vermin of New York were there , from the Young Aesthetes to Sherman . I managed to evade them all , and to get at a table which included but one Americano , and he was a parlor anarchist . I picked up four dinner invitations . Four more lies on my conscience when the time comes . Anderson showed up wearing a navy blue shirt with a soft collar and a flowing necktie to match .

Dreiser was invited , but did n't come . The ladies ran to adiposity , but I saw 2 or 3 cuties . Probably stenographers . A dry party . Yours , H.L.M. De Kruif : Mencken had known him since 1919 , when he encouraged de Kruif to go into the popularization of science and medicine . The year after Mencken wrote this letter to Sara , de Kruif published Microbe Hunters , his first bestseller . Ager : probably dialectical for ague . Sherman : Stuart P. Sherman TO THEODORE DREISER Dreiser had written Mencken testily , charging that Mencken had criticized him in the review articles in the Smart Set . TO BERNARD DE VOTO September , 25th /1926/ Dear Mr. De Veto : - Save by some dreadful and unprecedented act of God , I see no chance of getting such an editorial job as you describe . They are all drudgery . Even mine is drudgery , and I am having a hell of a time getting six weeks ' holiday . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stay where you are . The post at least gives you some leisure . As for the doings of the academic Babbitts , I see no reason why you should let them worry you . You 'd find worse Babbitts in any editorial office . Laugh at them , and go on about your business . The pressure for jobs in every magazine office is gigantic . Every Spring I receive applications from half the graduates of Vassar and Smith . The aspiring bucks are even more numerous . There is only one decent job in the average editorial office , and that is the boss 's . And he is a slave . Altogether , I advise you to take your promotion and thank the Holy Saints . You can work on your Mark Twain just as well at Evanston as in Boston , and maybe better . And you 'll have time to do other writing . Sincerely yours , Sedgwick once offered me a job . I refused it . I was wise in them times !

He yearned for the East Coast , preferably New York or Boston , and thought that an editorial job would get him there . Sedgwiek : Ellery Sedgwick . TO PAUL PATTERSON July 21st /1928/ Dear Paul : - During the past eight days ( July 14-21 , inc . ) I have read the editorial page of The Sun very carefully , and after due prayer the following observations suggest themselves . . . . I think the page now looks better than it has ever looked in the past , but there is still plenty of chance to improve it . . . . My doubts about " Down the Spillway , " previously expressed , continue . The idea behind the column is an excellent one , but it seems to me that it is badly executed . The point of view that the stuff mirrors is somewhat feeble and obvious : it suggests that of a rather self-conscious young college professor ? the sort of fellow who admires Christopher Morley and dreams of getting a whimsical essay into The Atlantic Monthly . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I think there ought to be more robustness , more gusto in it . It is supposed to set forth the casual meditations , not of pedagogues running a literary magazine , but of practical men engaged upon a vigorous and enterprising newspaper . I suggest some questions to test contributions . Would Edward Bok think this was charming ? Would it fit into the Hound &; Horn , published at Harvard ? Would William Lyon Phelps regret that he had not written it ? One yes should be sufficient to exclude . . . . The Letters to the Editor could stand a lot of improvement . Too many of them are quite pointless , too many are by numskulls , and too many are unsigned . . . . The editorial page miscellany is well selected , especially the longer pieces . Whoever gathers it should extend his reading as much as possible . Some of the best stuff is to be found in obscure publications . There is always a tendency in The Sun office to lean too heavily on one or two papers , notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masterpiece that it is sometimes represented to be . In many ways The Sun is already a far better paper , and there is no reason why it should n't be better in every way . Is anyone charged with going through the mass of propaganda papers and pamphlets that pass through the office ? They are full of odd matter and useful suggestions . Stanley Reynolds , in his Evening Sun days , used to dredge superb stuff out of the Congressional Record . Someone should be told off to read it carefully . The same man should see that his name goes on the mailing-lists of all known propaganda organizations . They send out a great deal of amusing blather . The editorials , it seems to me , are pretty well written , and the choice of subjects is good , but I believe that they are often a bit too cautious in tone . . . . The Sun is not a court of justice ; it is a newspaper of the Opposition , which is to say , an open and avowed advocate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic ; it is to search out weaknesses in the Administration and expose them as dramatically as possible . When a Secretary of State is caught in an embarrassing predicament , made by an imbecile predecessor of his own party , it is not the business of an Opposition paper to make excuses for him . Let him do that for himself , with such aid as he can get from the organs of the Administration . It is not only the privilege of an Opposition paper to make him as uncomfortable as possible ; it is its highest duty to do so .. . One of the chief purposes of The Sun , as I understand it , is to stir up such useful hatreds . I think it could go much further in that direction than it has gone . Here , to be sure , I generalize rather gaily on somewhat meagre evidence . The week I have reviewed was a week of dulness . But I think it is still fair to say that The Sun has by no means made effective use of the opportunities standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assaulted the Administration with any vigor . The Kent articles have defended Hoover with great ingenuity , even when he was plainly caught with the goods ; the paper itself has let him off with a few mild remonstrances . Thus the average reader , and especially the average intelligent reader , has probably got the notion that it is disposed to be friendly to him . The only way to dispose of that error is to tackle him head ? on . Good chances offer themselves every day . An Opposition paper should seek them out and make the most of them . The acts of the Administration should be reviewed constantly , and with the deliberate purpose of finding weaknesses in them , and those weaknesses should be denounced in plain terms and without reservations of any kind . In journalism , it seems to me , it is far better to be wrong than to be timorous . The papers that get attention are those that take a positive line , and stick to it with tenacity . The opportunity lying before The Sun is almost unparallelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , and can afford to do whatever it pleases . It has a competent editorial and news staff , and the salient men on that staff are in sympathy with its politics . Its good faith is generally admitted . It is not tied to any politician . Its only serious opposition is offered by the New York World , a paper in decay , and the St. Louis Post ? Dispatch , which is far away . It has no local rivals of any dignity . I believe that it ought to assert itself , and that it will . I recommend that a steady increase in editorial vigor be made a matter of fixed policy , and that editorials be printed on Page 1 whenever it is possible . There is no need to be ashamed , certainly , of what it is doing now . But it can do more . . . .

I have been gnawing into them for weeks , but they do n't hardly seem to get no smaller scarcely . The other p.m . I was hacking a slice offen one of them and the knife slipped and I got cut . But the wurst did n't seem to be hurt none . The cut seems to be getting on so so . What is a little blood to a war hero ?

TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this protest would be unwise . It plainly indicates that the Protestants have been damaged and are alarmed . Speaking for The American Mercury I must refuse to admit any such thing . We print whatever we please about Christian Scientists , and pay no attention to their objections . In one of the early issues of the magazine , in fact , I served public notice upon them that we were against them , and since then I have heard from them but twice . Once their press representative in New York called upon me and we had a very frank and friendly conversation . He made no demands and no threats , and left with the clear understanding that he could expect nothing from the magazine . The other time the press committee asked me to print a caveat to certain statements made by Dakin in his book . I refused flatly , and that was all . Your third paragraph , mentioning The American Mercury , is in error . No delegation of Christian Scientists has ever visited the office , nor have I ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no advertisement that was lost because of Christian Scientist pressure . If anything of the sort came to pass we 'd sue at once . That , it seems to me , is what the Scribners should do now . Protests are worth nothing , but notice of a suit for damages always gets attention . I had it out with the Christian Scientists in Baltimore nearly 20 years ago , and they have been quiescent there ever since . My plan was simply to damn them day in and day out , disregarding their protests . As fast as they could meet one accusation I printed five or six more . They are immensely vulnerable . Their whole literature reeks with palpable nonsense . As I say , my advice is against printing a protest . If you want to do something against them , print half a dozen articles exposing their methods . But do n't do anything to make it appear that they are actually doing damage .

Dear Dr. Bowden : Here are my attempts to answer your questions : 1 . I seldom do any writing during the day . An old newspaper habit inclines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable to write then , for there are fewer telephone calls and less other noise . 2 . I put in practically all of my waking hours at one form or other of work . I commonly devote the mornings to reading manuscripts and mail for The American Mercury and the afternoons to various other editorial duties . Thus I am thrown upon the evenings for the chance to work . 3 . I rest whenever I can at irregular intervals . Like most men , I am lazy by nature and seize every opportunity to loaf . 4 . I have no favorite form of exercise , for all exercise seems to me to be a bore . However , I like to walk when I have anywhere to go , and do a good deal of walking here in Baltimore . 5 . My experience is that no man can write continuously for more than three hours -- in fact , it is seldom that he can go beyond two hours . After that , though he may keep on writing , he will not produce anything fit to print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper experience has taught me how to think out what I want to write before I set it down . 7 . I work best , like most men , in my own work-room . I have always found it impossible to do any writing in New York . The town is too noisy for it and I am too much interrupted by bores . 8 . Very few books , it seems to me , are worth reading thoroughly . When I find one I read every word of it , but ordinarily I proceed more rapidly and it is seldom that the ordinary book occupies me for more than two hours . 9 . I commonly work on two or three projects at a time . If I am writing , say , a book , I must also give a great deal of attention to current magazine and newspaper work . 10 . I have no plan for getting the most out of my time . I simply do the best I can . 11 . I keep notes , but often lose them . When I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a more or less orderly manner . However , it is my experience that half of them always go to waste . 12 . When I am writing I try to exclude all other thoughts . This , of course , is sometimes difficult . 13 . Your thirteenth question is rather vague . I try to keep my mind on the track , but it naturally tends to fly off . It often happens that while at work on one thing lam seized with what seem to be excellent ideas for another . I always make notes of them , but usually those notes turn out to be useless . 14 . This has been answered under #9. 15 . I simply ca n't work when anyone else is in the room . Nor have I ever heard of any other writer who could . It is done , of course , in newspaper offices , but even there it is not done by men who are trying to write careful stuff . 16 . Sometimes it goes one way and sometimes another . My ideas are suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by conversations with intelligent friends . 17 . I read almost everything . I boast indeed that I can read anything . One of my favorites is the Congressional Record . It is commonly thought to be dull , but that is a superstition . There is more good stuff in it than in any newspaper overheard of . 18 . I use a Corona typewriter . It would be difficult for me to try to write by hand . I have not done so for more than thirty years . I can dictate letters and other such things , but I find it difficult to dictate anything for print . Perhaps I could manage it if I tried hard , but so far I have found it more convenient to use the typewriter myself . 19 . This question , it seems to me , is unanswerable . Men who are destined for success by God will inevitably become successful . Nothing can be done to save the others .

Last night I had three quart bottles in my side yard , cooling in a bucket . Two went off at once , bringing my neighbor out of his house with yells . He thought that Soviets had seized the town . I have lost about 12 good Apollinaris bottles , but still trust in God . Next time I shall wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my cellar . However , I have the bottle covered with bags , and there is no damage . I invited two beer fanatics to test the stuff last night . I opened the bottle wearing heavy automobile gloves and with bagging and a fire-screen to protect me . When the stopper was thrown back , all save about two gills blew out . But the fanatics pronounced the two gills very soothing . I shall make some dandelion wine if I can find a dandelion . But down here they are not to be trusted . Dogs always piss on them . Also , now and then , a policeman . Yours , TO FRANCIS HACKETT June 10 , 1933 . Francis Hackett , Esq . Newt ownmountkennedy , County Wicklow , Ireland . Dear Hackett : Once more , we have proven that virtue is an evil in this world . Almost alone among American magazines , The American Mercury is still paying authors promptly . As a result , your check got off to Ireland before your letter of May 29th came in , and so your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you and Mrs. Hackett are coming back in October . You 'll see a show that has not been matched in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire . For years I predicted that this great Republic is a fair weather sailor and that at the first sign of serious trouble the American people would show a tremendous demoralization . It has certainly happened . You will be amazed to hear the talk that is going on among the so-called well-to-do . Nine-tenths of them seem to be convinced that a revolution is on us and the rest simply wander around in a haze . As for me , I see no reason for serious alarm . The saving class is being shaken out of its accumulated money ? a phenomenon of regular occurrence in the Western world , There is still plenty to eat in America and getting it to those who need it is , after all , not an insoluble problem . As soon as the schemes of the Brain Trust get under way , a large number of new speculators will begin to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you still read The New Republic you are aware of the painful contortions of the brethren . They have been wobbling between Communism and despair for three or four years past , and now hang on to the Brain Trust without knowing where it is going . Altogether , the show is magnificent and I have been having a roaring time . My only hope is that there will be another general war before I pass from these scenes . The last one was lovely , but it was over too soon . I am planning to get a sabbatical year in 1934 and finish a couple of books that have been hanging fire for three or four years . Editing a magazine is a full-time job and my energy is now somewhat less than it was back in the last century .

TO EDGAR LEE MASTERS August 11 , 1934 . Dear Masters : You will be saddened , though you did n't know her personally , to hear of the death of Miss Pearl Snow . She was in public life in Baltimore for thirty-five years , and had the respect and good will of large numbers of its leading men . Her establishment in Watson Street was conducted in an extremely hightoned manner , and during the whole period of her administration the cops had business in it only half a dozen times . She specialized in entertaining members of Congress , many of whom dropped over from Washington of an evening to discuss public matters with her . Her staff of interns was mainly recruited from York County , Pennsylvania , where she was born herself , her maiden name being Tillie Crouse . She was buried from St. John 's Evangelical Lutheran Church , and a large congregation was in attendance , including many public men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is always unwise to judge anyone harshly , and that there is undoubtedly a lot of good in all of us . I took the liberty of dropping a tear in your name . Yours , HLM Masters thanked Mencken for the sad news of Miss Snow 's demise and added that it might explain a recent dream he had about a fire in a whorehouse . He told Mencken that he doubtless had it at " the hour of Miss Snow 's departure , " and wondered if Mencken could tell him what that hour was . TO EDGAR LEE MASTERS August 18 , 1934 . Dear Masters : My apologies for this delay in replying to your inquiry about the exact moment of Miss Pearl Snow 's death . The only person with her at the time was her old chief-ofstaff , Miss Lola Pearson , and it took me several days to come up with her , for she had gone back to Red Lion , Pennsylvania , immediately after the funeral , and returned here only yesterday . She tells me that Miss Pearl passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please do n't forget to remind your astrologers that this is God 's time , not daylight time . Daylight time was tried here in Maryland for several years , but Christian sentiment lined up against it and so it was abolished . We now follow the will of Heaven , as it is interpreted by the Naval Observatory at Washington . It is a well-known fact that calamities always come in threes . A month or two ago Miss Cora Edwards died , and then followed Miss Pearl Snow . I now hear that Miss Mary Healy is on her death-bed , with her exodus expected at any moment . She is extremely advanced in age , and has been retired from public life for years . Nevertheless , I am old enough to remember when she was a leading figure in the town , and the intimate of many eminent men . I have myself seen three United States Senators , a governor , a mayor and two Congressmen in her parlor at one time , all drunk and each with a girl on his knee . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political economics combined to ruin us . If Miss Mary passes away notify you by the Morse telegraph . Yours , " We all have hundreds of years of life ahead of us , " Mencken writes briskly here , never realizing that Sara was suffering the onset of her final illness . Thanks for the check : Liberty- paid Mencken a handsome $1,000 per article . In his ledger , under the date of May 17 , 1935 , he noted the receipt of the check he mentions . It was in payment for " Peace on Earth ? Why We Have Wars , " which Oursler did not print till December 26 , 1936 . The article on the schools never came through , since Mencken was increasingly preoccupied with his wife 's health . TO MAX BROEDEL H L MENGSEN 754 E ? THEISS ? L ST e ? LTiktost Wednesday /May 29 , 1935/ My dear Max : - Sara has meningitis , with t.b . bacilli in the spinal fluid . It is , of course , completely hopeless . She seems comfortable - at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horrible headache has passed off , and she sleeps peacefully all day long . She may be aroused for half a minute , but hardly for =ere . This is the climax of her long aeries of illnesses . It would be silly to say that I have not anticipated it ; in fact , I have dreaded it constantly . But it is appalling to face . What is directly ahead I do n't know . She fights magnificently in the shadows , with a strong heart and steady pulse . But it ca n't be long now . Yours , M TO F. SCOTT FITZGERALD June 7 , 1935 . F. Scott Fitzgerald , Esq. , Grove Park Inn , Asheville , N. C. My dear Scott : Thanks so much for your two notes . Poor Sara made an extraordinarily gallant , brave and patient struggle , but it had been uphill for several years past , and a couple of weeks ago it became completely hopeless . I am going to England for a few weeks with my brother , who has been ill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a session . I only hope that Zelda is showing a steady improvement . Yours , itriv , . TO CORLISS LAMONT April 22 , 1936 . Dear Dr. Lamont : Thanks very much for your letter , which has just reached me on my return from a speech-making trip to New York , a somewhat rare dissipation for me . I met Heywood Broun on the train going up , and we had a long gabble on the horrors of human existence . I must say that , for a friend of the downtrodden , he looked to be extraordinarily well fed . The other day , re-reading Huxley 's essay on Government , 1880 , I came upon this : The results of political changes are hardly ever those which their friends hope or their foes fear . " I must have picked this up as a boy , for I have been preaching it ever since I began to write . Thus I agree with you completely that , if anything resembling Communism is ever set up in America , it will probably come in by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different effects . Nevertheless , it seems to me to be fair to say that when the American Communists speak of a revolution , the thing they have in mind is essentially a repetition of the Russian revolution . And that the thing which principally excites them is the thought that , when it comes , they will get a grand chance to cut off the ears of persons they now dislike . I detect very little that can be rationally described as reason in their tirades . They swallow palpable nonsense , and reject multitudes of plain facts . In brief , they are moved by passion , not by logic , and I believe that their principal passion is the old motive-power of democracy , to wit , envy . You say that you are not a Communist , and I must , of course , accept it . But if you had said it in time I 'd have had to put you into the " I Am Not a Communist-But " Club that I am launching in the American Mercury for May , with Broun and Upton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that you are not actually a member of the party is immaterial . You are giving aid and encouragement to undoubted Communists , and you are certainly not making very clear the nature of your dissent from their position . Inasmuch as I believe , as I have said , that they are all suspicious characters , intellectually speaking , I simply can ' t imagine how you can arrive at any alliance with them , however reserved , by a process of reason . I 'd as soon enter into an alliance with chiropractors , Methodist bishops , or , indeed , New Deal uplifters . . . . Your argument against me in " Soviet Planning in Socialist Russia " is fair shooting , but it overlooks one of my points . That is that social capital enslaves the worker quite as much as any other kind of capital . He must work or starve in Russia as well as here , and the kind of work he must do is mainly determined , not by his own inclinations , but by the needs and ambitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to strike , and only the feeblest sort of right to bargain . Even protest and remonstrance may be hazardous to him . My contention is that he is thus worse off than his brother in the United States . Even the unemployed here are probably better fed and housed than skilled workmen in Russia . And if not , they are at least free to holler , which is surely something . The general incompetence of the Russian industrial machine is the sempiternal incompetence of politicians . They do everything badly . I must confess that I prefer a country where plumbing is carried on by plumbers , and the pipes actually work , even though those plumbers operate from the dug-outs of entrenched greed , and must be paid lavishly for exercising their art . Not infrequently , enjoying the comforts of a good bathroom , I suspect that they may really deserve what they demand . My apologies for an over-long letter . I have n't had the pleasure of meeting your brother , but I must know a great many of his colleagues . Do you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you let me hear of it the next time . The cooks here have enlightened ideas , and the best beer in America is on tap . I repay you for making me read " Socialist Planning " by sending you a book weighing nearly four pounds , and as completely devoid of politics as a college yell . Your book against immortality , of course , I know . It seems to me to be a very sound and effective piece of work . Sincerely yours , Dr. Corliss Lamont , 450 Riverside Drive , New York City . In all Mencken 's correspondence this is probably the most cogent explanation of how he stood on Communism and why . Dr. Lamont : a Columbia Ph.D . in philosophy . Heywood Broun : a prominent radical reporter and writer , he was quite fat . " Soviet Planning in Socialist Russia " : Mcneken was mistaken ; Lamont 's pamphlet was called " Socialist Planning in Soviet Russia . " Your brother : Austin Lamont , an anesthesiologist , had begun to teach at the Johns Hopkins Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1936 . Dear Dreiser : Your mocking does n't shake me . I am still convinced , on the massive evidence brought forth by Father Vogel , that demoniacal possession is still possible on this earth . Moreover , I am convinced that it is rampant in Iowa . The fact explains many other inexplicable phenomena in that great State . I have lately discovered that the State of Maryland maintains an official board for inspecting madstones . I have procured a specimen passed by it , and shall send it to you in a few days . It is said to be efficacious , not only against hydrophobia , but also against 10,000 other diseases , most of them fatal . The chairman of the board tells me that clapping it on the head behind either ear for two minutes will cure the most frightful headache ever heard of . It is also said to be helpful in cases of impotence , but on this point I offer no opinion . I have been sweating away here in this lovely weather writing a history of the Baltimore Sun which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job is off my hands , I 'll start for the two national conventions . I surely wish you were coming along . The shows this year will be really magnificent . The worst quacks ever heard of on earth will be assembled , and they 'll all be on their toes . I look for such obscenities as the human eye has never hitherto beheld . If you are still collecting postcards I 'll be able to send you one from Cleveland and another from Philadelphia . Let me know about this . I do n't want to waste the money on the stamps if you have stopped collecting them . God help us all ! Yours , M Madstones : from the time in his early twenties when he invented a wild man in the outskirts of Baltimore in order to enliven the pages of his paper , Meneken showed his relish for practical joking . His brother August once collected the records and evidence of his hoaxes and they filled a slipcase . They ranged from the creation and ultimate perfection of an imaginary uncle named Fred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tag printed up , on which the proper state authorities certified the genuineness of the stone ; the tag went with each stone he sent out . TO AILEEN PRINCLE June 29 , 1936 . Miss Aileen Pringle , 722 Adelaide Place , Santa Monica , California . Dear Aileen : I have just got in from the Philadelphia convention and feel like the oldest man on earth . It was in its way a lot of fun , but it was also a dreadfully tedious job and full of grief for journalists . On the closing day the orgies in Franklin Field were really dreadful . The press-stands were wobbly , the rain soaked both typewriters and copy paper , there was no adequate light and a great swarm of ringers climbed all over the newspaper boys and girls . Several times in the course of the evening I was almost at the point of cursing God and dying , but I managed to survive somehow . When you read my account of the proceedings please remember that it was done in twelve separate pieces and that what appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pieces are full of typographical errors , but such things simply ca n't be helped under the conditions that have to be faced at a national convention . My stuff is never printed in any paper save the Baltimore Sun . I have had overtures from time to time from virtually all the syndicates in the country , including the Hearst syndicates , but I have always managed to resist them . If I had two papers to write for I 'd be thinking of the limitations of both , and if there were three I 'd have all three to think of and so on ad infinitum . Writing for the Sun alone , I know precisely how far I can go and what the customers will understand and like . Writing for syndicates always dilutes aman 's stuff . To be sure , it brings in a pretty penny , but I do n't need the money and am thus not disposed to put up with nuisance . I do n't recall writing any abuse of Hearst . I have mentioned him from time to time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am printing in the July American Mercury , but on the whole I am rather in favor of him . He has , to be sure , engaged in practices that as a professing Christian I must abhor , but on the other hand he has helped to make journalism amusing and has apparently had a swell time himself . The worst charge I hear against him is that he was once guilty of adultery , but I am told that he has given up this evil practise in recent years , and so I am willing to forgive him . Certainly he is a much better man than most of his enemies . The radicals who rant against him would all be delighted if he gave them easy jobs . He did more to lift journalism salaries in this country than any other publisher . More anon , when I get the sand out of my eyes . I always enjoyed political conventions , and they are certainly exhausting . Yours , On becoming engaged to Sara Haardt , Mencken had asked Aileen Pringle to return his letters . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had felt hurt at this excess of formality but complied . She wrote to him after Sara 's death and thus took the first step in reviving their attach . meni . TO H. W. SEAMAN December 5 , 1936 . H. W. Seaman , Esq. , 46 Neville St. , Norwich , England . Dear Seaman : In this country sympathy seems to be running mainly in favor of His Majesty , but I must confess that I have some doubts myself . A man in his position is under the obligation to play the game according to the rules , and it seems to me that he has failed . Obviously , it would not do for the King of England to have two morganatic brothers-in-law hanging about the back door of the palace . His job pays him an excellent salary and surrounds him with an enormous amount of adulation . I believe that in return for these great boons he should be willing to make some sacrifices of his own private inclinations . Moreover , I am convinced that his love affair is ridiculous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a lovely widow , it would be something else again , but to fall for a highly oxidized double-divorcee is certainly not to be put down as heroic . If these observations offend you as a patriotic Britisher , I apologize most profoundly . The effect of the sudden burst of headlines in London must have been gigantic . My brother and I have been lamenting the fact that we are not on the scene to enjoy the show . In this country the story has crowded the Spanish revolution completely off the first pages-in fact , it has crowded all other news inside . I have n't seen the New York Times for a couple of days , but I am sure that it must be printing at least three solid pages a day . Here in Baltimore the Sun is doing almost as well . The story , as the actors say , has everything . It is the most colossal Cinderella story heard of in centuries , and it is full of melodramatic details . In brief , it is probably the best newspaper story since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its clutches and that you are kept jumping . Let me hear from you when you feel like it . Yours , V --  ? 64 Baltimoreans had a particular interest in the crisis which led , on December 11 , 1936 , to the abdication of Edward VIII . The woman he announced he could not live without belonged to an old Baltimore family , the Warficlds . She had already been divorced once before divorcing Ernest Simpson to marry the Duke of Windsor . TO MAX BROEDEL July 1st /1938/ Dear Max : - I enclose the programme of a swell concert . Despite the fact that it was given in an open courtyard almost a block long , the acoustics were perfect . Benda took the Gluck overture much slower than we play it . I rather like our own style better . The weather here is perfect , and the country is lovely . I was in Leipzig last week , and made an automobile tour through the country in the neighborhood of Oschatz , where my great-grandfather was hanged in 1835 . It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who translated into Leipzig German , and so I made out pretty well . The crops , all save fruit , are very large , and the poor Bauern are worked to death by the harvest . They actually turn out at 5 A.M. and stay in the fields until dark , which is 10 P.M. All the young men have gone to the cities , where jobs are plentiful . There is a real shortage of labor , and the papers are full of Help Wanted ads . Some of this may be military preparation , but a lot of it is building . In almost every street in Berlin some new building is going up . The Jewish business is somewhat mysterious . Plenty of Jewish stores are still open , and seem to be doing a fair trade . Some of them are marked with the names of their owners , thus : MARIE : MODE Inh . Jakob Finkelstein But not all are so marked . I have seen no daubing of shop-windows . A very few shops are marked " arierische Geschaft " or something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bremen , Leipzig , Magdeburg , Braunschweig , Halle and Potsdam even the Inhaber signs are missing . There has been some plain exaggeration in the newspaper reports , but even so the situation of some of the Jews is very bad . They have been driven out of many small towns , and are concentrated in the cities . The Public Health Service doctor at the American consulate told me that many of the richer ones are trying to get visas for the United States . Only those who have well-to-do friends or relatives in America are passed . I am off for Danzig tomorrow , and if I have time shall proceed to Frankfurt on my return to Berlin , and try to see something of the Rhine and the Schwarzwald before I return . I am booked to sail on the Europa July 19th . My German is holding out pretty well , and so far I have never had to call for help . Sometimes the people I try it on look astonished , but they always understand it . My gizzard is behaving pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pilsener here is much better than at home . Despite the row with the Czechs , it is sold everywhere . Yours , In mid-June 1938 Meneken sailed for Germany . It presented a mixed picture to Meneken as he reported it to Broedel . The weather was fine , the crops bountiful , and the people busy . But the persecution of the Jews was an undoubted fact , and , for some of them , damaging indeed . For others , as Mencken saw it , it was less so . In cases where the name of a business , such as " Marie : Mode , " was not also the name of the Jewish proprietor , his name now had to be set beside it . But in certain cities Mencken did not even see the " In-holier " or " Proprietor " signs . He could not bring himself to believe that the American newspapers were reporting Hitler 's outrages accurately .
