txt Letters Letters Westway Is the Worst Kind of Pork Barrel ' To the Editor : So manna has fallen from the heavens , taxes can go down , services can be increased and we can all live happily ever after . Westway will be built . Hogwash ! Westway is the worst kind of pork-barrel public work . It fills no real transportation need . The arguments advanced for the project are fallacious . First we are asked to believe that while Congress will not approve a mass-transit " tradein " authorized by law , it will approve , as it must , a roadway costing $5,000 per inch . I tried that one on my kids and they would n't buy it . We are asked to believe that the current transHudson crossings will limit the number of autos in Manhattan even as New Jersey Governor Byrne is asking the Port Authority to build another one . Then we are required to believe that while the state can put up $120 million for the local share of Westway and spend another $100 million for the right-of-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $86 million for the local share of the mass-transit " trade-in . " By this time we are mature enough to recognize that the city and state are now so closely linked fiscally that what one can do , the other can do as well and what one can not do , the other will also be unable to accomplish . . Finally , we have to believe that the construction of Westway will spur billions of dollars of private investment . But there are so many areas of the city that cry out for private investment ( i.e. incomplete Manhattan Landing , the old loft area in the valley , Harlem and Clinton ) . Certainly if scarce private capital is invested in an area without transportation services , To the Editor : The election of 1976 indicates that a situation now exists which differs from the past . Formerly , a Presidential candidate , in order to win , needed to carry two of three states : California , Illinois and New York . No exception to that rule had occurred during the long period after the Republican Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rule was broken when Jimmy Carter won despite his loss of Illinois and California . Another rule that was breached in 1976 pertains to Illinois alone . It has been called the best weathervane state . In the thirty elections held during the lifetime of the Republican Party , only once did ' a successful candidate fail to carry Illinois . Last year , the national loser , President Ford , was the winner there . And yet another precedent went down in 1976 . Between 1846 and 1976 , all the Democratic Presidents ( who first entered the White House as Presidents-elect ) had come from the Northeast : Pierce ( New Hampshire ) ; Buchanan ( Pennsylvania ) ; Cleveland ( New York ) ; Wilson ( New Jersey ) ; F. Our Unlikely Buddy To the Editor : In just a few days , Jimmy Carter will join the ranks of Tommy Jefferson , Woody Wilson and Frankie Roosevelt . True , acting " Presidential " is never going to be easy for Mr. Carter , but he might make an effort . The news photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and visitors in their business suits  --  do not help . Whether Mr. Carter . likes it or not , the fact is that teased hair and buddy systems are out and statesmanship , . pomp and circumstance are in . I doubt very much if the people really want a buddy in the White House . I can not believe that the people want a " common man " in the Oval Room . I believe they want an uncommon man for an uncommon job . When William Congreve protested to Voltaire that he wanted to be thought of as a common man , Voltaire replied : " Had you been that , I should never have come to see you . " During the recent campaign , Mr. Carter was kind enough to publish a list of the books he had read ( a lot could be said about that ) . I do not recall whether Charles de Gaulle was on the list or not , but he would have been a good addition because he knew the image of leadership . He wrote in " Edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without mystery , for familiarity breeds contempt . " I hope the environment in the nation 's capital will work some magic . HENRY D. FAIRLIE Montclair , N. J. , Jan. 10 , 1977 schools , hospitals and ut , ities , it will be denied to areas more suitable for redevelopment . All of these assumptions must be believed so that we can carry a few thousand commuters in their cars to lower Manhattan at the cost of clean air and billions of dollars . Will we never learn ? Apparently not ! ROBERT N. RICKLES Executive Director Institute for Public Transportation New York , Jan. 5 , 1977 ? To the Editor : Taking one aspect of ; our Jinn. 5 editorial , you appear to be somewhat naive in your stand favorLig Westway . Talking about the " effective controls against ... the disruption of neighboring communities , " you go on to say that " monitoring those controls is the role of the city 's watchdogs now . " What of the entrance and exit plans for 14th Street ? Lowell Bridwell , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this information has not been forthcoming . Many buildings on the north side of 14th Street will be torn down to accommodate a ramp or ramps , but there has been no disclosure of the general entrance and exit ramp design relating to 14th Street . Anyone familiar with the traffic on 14th Street during rush hours and on Saturdays knows that one can frequently and quite literally walk across Manhattan Island faster than one can make it in a bus , taxi or private automobile . When this question was put to Mr. Bridwell and his staff at public meetings , the answer was that the D. Roosevelt ( New York ) , and Kennedy ( Massachusetts ) . The recent success of a Democrat from Georgia points backward to the days when the party descended from Thomas Jefferson was led by Southerners : Madison , Monroe , Jackson , Polk . Why did deviations from three formidable precedents occur in 1976 ? Is the victory of President-elect Carter explained by the growth of the Sunbelt ? Since he won in both Florida and Texas , perhaps those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , along with California , Illinois and New York . One tradition survived the contest of 1976 . Governor Carter won in North Carolina as well as in nine other states of the area of the Civil War Confederacy . It is axiomatic that a candidate who wins in North Carolina will get a majority of the electoral votes of the eleven states of the Old South . As Illinois was once the best weathervane for the country as a whole , North Carolina remains the best index of Presidential preference in Dixie . CURTIS P. NETTELS Ithaca , N.Y. , Jan. 6 , 1977 To the Editor : Spokesmen for the Indian Government have been saying in recent weeks that " practically all " political prisoners have been released . As a detainee , I would like to inform your readers that this is just not true . A few opposition leaders , including members of Parliament , have been set free to create the impression of " relaxation . " But the overwhelming majority of dissidents ? estimated at around 65,000 ? are still in custody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Indian Government is using the detainees to blackmail opposition parties into ' + giving assurances of " good conducts- and thus forfeiting forever their basic democratic rights . Meanwhile , its tactic is to release one or two prisoners each day to bolster the claim that normal democratic conditions are being restored . This is indeed a gigantic hoax on world opinion , not to speak of the agony such deceit inflicts on us behind bars . The awesome tragedy of India is that so many thousands of people should continue to be locked up in prisons  --  many have been held for as long as 18 months without a day 's parole  --  for no valid reason . There are no disturbances in any part of India , and opposition parties have recently told Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that they do not believe in violence and are prepared to work the democratic process . But drunk with power , the Government wants a total and abject surrender to its draconian edicts . Elizabeth Van Hall 's planners were not funded to study the traffic flow once off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of ramps and " feeder " streets , and that 's the rub . Our West Village streets are narrow . Many still are paved with their original stone blocks . In what is officially designated a historic landmark area , a great many of the homes are made of brick . Built as they were in the early and mid-19th century , they simply are not strong enough to withstand the vibration of traffic . As a homeowner who worked closely with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to restore my two-family home , I am dismayed to see the brownstone cracking , the brick facade cracking and my interior ceilings and walls cracking . . . all because of vibration . In the projected 10 to . 15 years it will take to build Westway , our homes will most certainly suffer substantial additional damage from construction traffic . Traffic to and from the massive apartment construction planned for the river landfill , when finished , will be an additional problem . This has never been fairly discussed with our neighborhood groups or Community Board No. 2 . The planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have shown no honest concern for this historic and economically viable district . EDWARD 0 . DOUGLAS Vice President Association of Village Homeowners New York , Jan. 5 , 1977 ? To the Editor : In all the discussions of the new Westway there does not seem to be one word on the possibility of a continuation of the rail line already existing on the city 's West Side . The potential for a rapid-transit line on the West Side , properly thought out , could be realized with a relatively small capital expenditure . If the aim is to move people quickly , it would be a mistake not to provide for this potential in the design of the Westway . SAMUEL J. RESNICK New York , Jan. 9 , 1977 Resentment among the detainees is growing and may take the form of mass hunger strikes if they are not released soon . But our morale is high despite the humiliations and hardships . If it comes to that , we are ready to die as Mrs. Gandhi 's captives ? which could be an appropriate epitaph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India , Jan. 5 , 1977 Moynihan ' Polemics ' To the Editor : Daniel Patrick Moynihan , in his Jan. 4 Op-Ed piece , advocates en ' approach to foreign policy that could further isolate the United States in the world community . The dialogue between the rich and the poor nations is , for him , nothing more than a sparring to win points . While pressing human rights as a strong suit for this country to use , he forgets our own vulnerabilities in this area , e.g. , racism , degrading poverty amid plenty and the frightful dragnet of our intelligence agencies . His choice of Chile to make his point is clever . Neither the thirdworld countries nor Western liberals could take exception to his attacking the repressive regime in Chile . However , the serious task of alleviating human misery on this globe requires compassion and collaboration rather than clever polemics . GHULAM FMK ! , M.D. Wingdale , N. Y. , Jan. 5 , 1977 Election ' 76 : Toppled Precedents From a Bombay Prison : ' We Are Ready to Die ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on New Year 's Day from a foreign country , our family was delighted by the courtesy and efficiency of the employees of the U.S. State Department ( passport control ) and U.S. Customs . This welcome to the States was soon chilled , however , by the specter of taxicabs circulating like sharks through the icy ramps of the Pan Am terminal , their drivers approaching foreign arrivals to announce the rate of $10 per passenger to Manhattan , and then herding as many as five distracted visitors into a waiting , and duly licensed , vehicle . Welcome to New York , indeed ! CARL R. BALDWIN New York , Jan. 3 , 1977
