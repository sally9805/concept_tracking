In a lackluster mayoralty campaign that made up in the number of candidates fielded ( eleven in all ) for what it lacked in zest , Atlanta 's 35-year-old black vice mayor , Maynard Jackson , all 275 Ibs. of him , broke from the pack last week and finished first with 46.6% of the vote . In next week 's runoff , Jackson seems likely to beat incumbent Mayor Sam Massell , who finished second with 19.8% . Running a close third , with 19.1% of the vote , was Charles Weltner , a U.S. Congressman from 1963 to 1967 who was one of the South 's first white liberals in national politics . <P> The campaign 's only other black candidate , State Senator Leroy Johnson , sapped some of Jackson 's strength this time out , but could not keep Jackson from winning a giant 81% of the black vote . What has some observers worried , however , is the possibility of a deep racial split in the runoff . Jackson polled only 6% of the white vote . It is possible that white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in a two-man , black v. white race , they may turn out in significant enough numbers to defeat Jackson . Though 52.5% of Atlanta 's population is black , only 49% of its registered voters are . If Massell can bestir apathetic white voters , and Jackson falters seriously with the blacks , the outcome could be a surprise .
