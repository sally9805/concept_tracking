Money-Back Schools : Unclear Balance Sheet Why ca n't taxpayers get their money back if kids do n't learn in school ? For the past two years , the educational systems of 30 U.S. cities have been using various forms of just such profit-and-loss incentives . Under the terms of " performance contracting , " private companies-sometimes textbook publishers , sometimes groups of psychologists and teachers-take over public classrooms , try whatever teaching methods they like , and are rigidly judged on the results ( TIME , Aug. 24 , 1970 ) . For children who do well , the firms get bonuses ; for students whose performance does not rise to the national level , the firms must give refunds to the school boards . Last week test scores for the most comprehensive contract , in Gary , Ind. , confirmed preliminary reports from other schools and showed that the technique can produce educational gains . <P> Gary needed them . A year ago , three out of every four of the 798 students in Banneker elementary school were reading below the national average for their grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . " We are at rock bottom , " admitted Alfonso D. Holliday II , a black physician who headed the city 's school board . At Holliday 's prodding , the board turned over the entire school for three years to Behavioral Research Laboratories , a firm based in Menlo Park , Calif . <P> Assembly Line . Behavioral Research sent Donald Kendrick , a former Lockheed systems analyst , to Gary as director of the school . " We want a job done , " he announced , likening education to the assembly line . " One fellow puts in the nuts , you put in the bolts , and the product comes out . " Kendrick transferred ten teachers , and used their salaries to augment his staff with 28 teacher 's aides . <P> Classifications by grade were abolished ; in reading and math , students used " programmed " workbooks ( published chiefly by B.R.L. ) that allowed them to work independently . One difference was noted by eleven-year-old Cheryl Garner , who transferred to Banneker : " In the other school , it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could earn up to $3,000 extra during the year for staying after class to take training classes or to develop new curriculums . Although only sixth-grade performance is considered in computing B.R.L. 's fees , at year 's end all students took standard tests given by an outside consulting firm that B.R.L. helped select . <P> Host of Questions . Last week 's tabulation of the test scores showed that nearly 73% of the children had reached or exceeded national levels in reading or math . But the gains were spotty . Among sixth-graders , 69% reached the average level in math but only 40% got there in reading . As a result , the firm had to refund $75,000 to the school system . Still , Gary Superintendent Gordon L. McAndrew pronounced the overall results " encouraging . "
