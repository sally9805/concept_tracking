Not all of Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan 's famous victories have been won on the desert sands . Last week he scored a notable triumph in a meeting of the Secretariat , the governing body of Israel 's ruling Labor Party . By a vote of 78-0 , the members approved a Dayan-originated plan-long and bitterly opposed by such doves as Foreign Minister Abba Eban and Finance Minister Pinhas Sapir-for Israeli economic penetration into the occupied Arab territories . The Secretariat vote enormously enhanced Dayan 's position within the Labor Party and quite possibly established him as the man most likely to succeed Golda Meir as Premier . <P> The fate of the plan-which calls for the Israeli treasury to put up $287 million for new development projects in the occupied territories , including Sinai and the Gaza-was never really in doubt . Sapir left before the vote , asking - in an admission of defeat-to have his recorded in the affirmative . In all , 83 members of the 161-member Secretariat were absent ; some presumably felt that the result of the vote was assured , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messiah ? As it was , the only negative sentiment was voiced by former Party Secretary-General Arieh Eliav . " This program is brought before us with the lashing of the whip of time and the scourge of haste and panic ! " he shouted . " There are many in this land whose souls weep in silence because of this document . I will be the voice of the ideological Jewry of silence and never , at no price and in no forum , will I ever vote for this document . " Sneered Golda Meir : " I have lived through 50 years of political activity and never before have we had a comrade who set himself up as a messiah . " Taken aback , Eliav announced that he would not vote at all . <P> Enactment of the development plan - which makes it appear less and less likely that Israel will ever voluntarily surrender any part of the occupied territories-has profound international implications . In fact , the Secretariat vote was not inspired by any spirit of nose-thumbing defiance toward the U.N . or the Arab world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next month 's general election . Although Labor has ruled throughout Israel 's 25-year history , it has never commanded an absolute majority in the 120-member Knesset ( Parliament ) . The charismatic Dayan , who is somewhat more popular with the electorate at large than he is with other leaders of the Labor Party , had threatened , in effect , to sulk in his tent through the election if the plan was not adopted . If Dayan were to defect from Labor or even withdraw from the campaign in silence , the party would stand to lose eight to ten seats and might even be toppled from power .
