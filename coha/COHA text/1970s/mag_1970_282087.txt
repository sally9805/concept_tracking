The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game are popular enough TV pastimes . But the most expensive , bitter and hilarious game of all is the one that the public never gets to see : the Rating Game . The rules are vague , the scoring is arbitrary , and the pawns are prime-time programs . Top network executives claim to have outgrown the game and have tried to call it off , but two of the all-time great competitors-CBS Senior Programming Vice President Michael Dann and NBC Audience Measurement Vice President Paul Klein-somehow did not give up the fight . The fascination lies not in who wins or loses but in how hysterically they play . <P> A few Sundays ago , their contest got so overheated that Dann felt compelled to phone NBC President Julian Goodman at his home . Flabbergasted at hearing from a CBS official a couple of echelons below him , Goodman first figured that Dann had been fired and was job-hunting . Dann was , in fact , on the line to ask Goodman to stop Klein &; Co. from planting newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well aware that Dann was a past master at using the press in the rating game , Goodman had no sympathy . " Mike , " he said , " you 've created a monster , and now it 's biting your ass . " <P> " You Are Scum ! " Mike Dann , 48 , is a feisty , loquacious virtuoso of survival who has risen steadily through 14 presidents and two networks . Paul Klein , 41 , is an irreverent disciple of Marshall McLuhan who is convinced he is brighter than his NBC bosses and not afraid to say so . Oddly enough , the rival vice presidents have never met , but they exchange terse little notes with endearments like " You are scum ! " <P> The game has never been fought harder than in the past two seasons . Until then , CBS could claim to have won for 13 straight years . NBC contented itself with the claim that it had become No. 1 in what really mattered-the " demographic " breakdowns ; that is , its viewers were younger , wealthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , in 1968-69 , NBC passed CBS in total audience for the first half of the season . Desperately , Dann countered with a few maneuvers : he rescheduled Hawaii Five-O , for example , so that it played opposite a more vulnerable NBC program . At season 's end , when the whole game seemed to ride on the ratings of a Cinderella special , Dann sent a poignant wire to the managers of CBS 's 200-odd affiliates . <P> " My option is coming due shortly , " it began . It wound up : " And how you promote Cinderella will tell me something about your personal feelings toward me . " In the end , by CBS figures , CBS was first again , by a slivery 20.3% to NBC 's 20.0% ( and ABC 's 15.6% ) . * Klein argued that the tabulation ignored NBC 's premiere week , and that actually the two networks finished in a dead heat , 20.1% to 20.1%.                    @
