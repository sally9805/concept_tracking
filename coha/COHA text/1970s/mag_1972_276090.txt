Twenty years ago , when he was a mere corporal in the King 's African Rifles , Idi Amin Dada had a vision that told him some day he would be ruler of all Uganda . It was an accurate prediction . Last month General Amin , now 44 , celebrated the first anniversary of his accession to Uganda 's presidency after leading a coup that ousted the demagogic Milton Obote . There was a massive parade through the streets of Kampala , Uganda 's capital , which featured a band in kilts and busbies marching to the skirl of bagpipes and sinuous dances by women from the Karamoja area dressed in colorful bras and wood-bark skirts . In all , more than 100,000 celebrating Ugandans , representing most of the nation 's 39 tribes and four regions , gathered to pay tribute to the mercurial leader who is familiarly known to his people as " Big Daddy . " <P> Daddy is big indeed . A former heavyweight champion of Uganda - he retired undefeated in 1960-Amin packs about 240 Ibs. on his chunky 6-ft. 3-in. frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A devout Moslem who detests hashish and miniskirts with equal fervor , he has four wives , three of whom take turns acting as official hostesses at presidential tea parties in Kampala . On Uganda 's hotter days , Amin is likely to show up at hotel pools clad only in a pair of faded blue shorts . <P> Amiable and approachable , he frequently answers his own phone in the President 's office , spends hours dispensing off-the-cuff advice to callers with problems . Big Daddy lives modestly enough , but he does have a $3,000,000 Israeli-built personal jet , which he has used to make a pilgrimage to Mecca , among other trips . He rockets around Kampala at breakneck speed in his own Jeep . Last year a military policeman warned him against speeding ; Amin cheerfully accepted the reprimand . ' ' It just goes to show , " he said , " that I am not above the law . " <P> Rough Justice . In Uganda , Amin is the law , and he is clearly in no hurry to return Uganda to civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept commissions as junior officers in the army , which handily makes them subject to courts-martial in cases of malfeasance . Amin , though , pays relatively little attention to his Cabinet . Much of the nation 's business is conducted at barazas-informal , impromptu powwows at which Big Daddy sits down with tribesmen , hears their complaints and dispenses rough justice . <P> Amin 's methods have endeared him to the people , but they have done nothing to solve Uganda 's vast economic problems , which he characteristically blames on the " corruption " of Obote 's regime . In fact , Amin has turned a blind eye to military spending and has allowed the army to run up mammoth bills on guns , trucks and other expensive hardware . Uganda has substantial untapped resources of iron and copper , but agriculture is the principal business . Crop prices ( principally for coffee , cotton and tea ) have not kept pace with inflationary living costs , and last year Uganda 's foreign exchange reserves fell from $44.8 million to $25 million . To help the faltering economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose strict import and trade controls .
