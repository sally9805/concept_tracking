" Poor 300-year-old beauty ! People took her for a thief , for a liar , for a heartless animal . They called her beast , slut , they wanted to strangle her . And her fault ? That she was doomed to live too long a time . I was sorry for her . " <P> - Leos Jancek ( 1925 ) <P> Most operas concentrate on the obvious : love ( usually thwarted ) , murder , political connivery . Not those by Czech Composer Jancek ( TIME , Dec. 5 , 1969 ) , who had a taste for fantasy and the mysterious . Moreover , in The Makopoulos Affair , completed in 1925 three years before his death , the composer created an opera that offers no arias , no immediately whistleable tunes but is nonetheless marked by a considerable genius . Last week , when the New York City Opera produced it , a sellout audience responded with a twelve-minute ovation , a generous part of it in praise of the ingenuity used by Director Frank Corsaro and Mixed-Media Experts Gardner Compton and Emile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is time . Adapted from a play by Czech Dramatist Karel Capek , it deals with a 342-year-old woman who calls herself Emilia Marty . She has not aged much physically , but she has seen , heard and had just about everything and everybody . Longevity has drained away all feeling and left only a beautiful monster of ice and ennui . " There is no joy in goodness , no joy in evil , " she says . " When you know that , your soul dies within you . " Nevertheless , she is still human enough to be terrified of death , and the opera observes her ruthlessly searching and seducing her way toward a document that holds the prescription for another 300 years of life . Finding it , she also finds the unexpected strength to refuse it and die nobly . Through Jancek 's music , the bitch goddess becomes an archangel . <P> The opera is remarkably powerful . All melody pared to its bare essentials , Jancek'a music illuminates Capek 's bizarre tale with a cold , exciting glare . Characters declaim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other , too tense to lapse into song . The orchestra vibrates with intense color and rhythm , microscopically reflective of each dramatic subtlety . <P> In Corsaro 's production , slides and movie films projected upon shifting , oddly shaped screens clarify the former identities of the heroine . Thus handled , Janacek 's propulsive overture is accompanied by a surrealistic visual nightmare of running figures , time travel , characters that melt from one person to another , and a Gestapo-like chauffeur who symbolizes death . During the opera 's action , the films subside into ghostly suggestions of thoughts and memories , some of them unabashed recollections of the heroine 's erotic past . When the secret-of-life document is burned , the entire stage ignites into a holocaust of blazing paper , billowing fog and dissolving people .
