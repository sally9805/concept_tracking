txt Senate and House conferees broke their impasse tonight on how President Carter and Congress should share responsibility for , preparing a plan to ratio gasoline in peril ods of shortage . They agreed on the issue that had been their principal stumbling block : how much Congressional participation there should be in approving a standby plan . Under the compromise , a Presidential standby plan could be rejected by Congress , but it would be extraordinarily difficult to do so . The system would work this way : Mr. Carter would send Congress his plan , which would automatically be available on a standby basis in 30 days unless both houses rejected it by joint resolution . The President could revive the plan by vetoing the resolution ; it would then take effect unless both houses of Congress overrode his veto by two-thirds majorities . Deciding how to share responsibility had been the only major question left to resolve . When a few final details have been cleared , a compromise bill will go to // dent all responsibility for designing a standby rationing plan . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress from drafting any rationing measure itself . The conferees ' agreement represented a step in the right direction from the viewpoint of the White House . The President has made the rationing bill a major part of his energy program but has had considerable difficulty in getting prompt Congressional response . The machinery adopted by the conference tonight gives Congress some opportunity to block a rationing plan sent by the President but makes it extraordinarily difficult to do so . Basically , the President 's authority to put such a plan on standby status remains very strong . The system would work this way : Mr. Carter would send Congress his plan , which would go into effect automatically in 30 days unless both houses rejected it by joint resolution . The President could revive the plan by vetoing the resolution ; it would then take effect unless both houses of Congress overrode his veto by two-thirds majorities . Senator J. Bennett Johnston , Democrat of Louisiana and the conference chairman , said that this compromise " makes it very difficult for Congress to block a rationing plan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already agreed on a second set of machinery to raise the plan from standby status to operation . If a 30-day shortage of motor fuel reaches 20 percent of past supplies , the President can order the plan into effect , but either house can block that action by a resolution of disapproval . If the fuel shortage is less than 20 percent , the President 's order becomes effective only if both houses waive the shortage requirement by joint resolution . Tonight 's Congressional action does not specify the details of how gasoline supplies would be distributed among the states , how many gallons a week an average driver might receive or what exceptions there may be . The conference committee deliberately gave the President the politically perilous task of making such decisions .

The President also scored another point when the commiteee endorsed his recommendation that energy projects given priority status by the board should be protected against laws interfering with their construction that might be passed after they were under contract . In a burst of activity , the energy committee resolved in principle many of the remaining issues on the Energy Mobilization Board legislation . Senator Henry M. Jackson , the chairman , said that the panel would try to complete action on the proposal tomorrow . Two comparable bills are awaiting House floor action . Meanwhile , the Senate Finance Committee took its first significant step toward drafting a " windfall " tax on profits resulting from price decontrol in the oil industry .
