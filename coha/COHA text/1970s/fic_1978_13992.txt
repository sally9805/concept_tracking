( DODGE just stares at the T.V. Long pause . He stifles two short coughs. ) p. 3 HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge ! You want a pill , Dodge ? ( He does n't answer . Takes the bottle out again and takes another long swig . Puts the bottle back , stares at T.V. , pulls blanket up around his neck . ) HALIE 'S VOICE You know what it is , do n't you ? It 's the rain ! Weather . That 's it . Every time . Every time you get like this , it 's the rain . No sooner does the rain start then you start . ( pause ) Dodge ? ( He makes no reply . Pulls a pack of cigarettes out from his sweater and lights one . Stares at T.V. pause . ) HALIE 'S VOICE You should see it coming down up here . Just coming down in sheets . Blue sheets . The bridge is pretty near flooded . What 's it like down there ? Dodge ? ( DODGE turns his head back over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turns back to the T.V. ) DODGE ( to himself ) Catastrophic .

HALIE 'S VOICE It was one of those kind of days . DODGE New Year 's ! HALIE 'S VOICE Yes ! It might 've been Florida . Or California ! One of those two . p. 7 DODGE Can I take my pick ? HALIE 'S VOICE It was Florida ! DODGE Aha ! HALIE 'S VOICE Wonderful ! Absolutely wonderful ! The sun was just gleaming . Flamingos . Bougainvilleas . Palm trees . DODGE ( to himself , mimicking her ) Bougainvilleas . Palm trees . HALIE 'S VOICE Everything was dancing with life ! There were all kinds of people from everywhere . Everyone was dressed to the nines . Not like today . Not like they dress today . DODGE When was this anyway ? HALIE 'S VOICE This was long before I knew you . DODGE Must 've been . HALIE 'S VOICE Long before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE Yes . Or it might 've been California . I 'm not sure which . DODGE All that way you were escorted ? HALIE 'S VOICE Yes . DODGE And he never laid a finger on you I suppose ? ( long silence ) Halie ? ( No answer . Long pause . ) HALIE 'S VOICE Are you going out today ? p. 8 DODGE ( gesturing toward rain ) In this ? HALIE 'S VOICE I 'm just asking a simple question . DODGE I rarely go out in the bright sunshine , why would I go out in this ? HALIE 'S VOICE I 'm just asking because I 'm not doing any shopping today . And if you need anything you should ask Tilden . DODGE Tilden 's not here ! HALIE 'S VOICE He 's in the kitchen . ( DODGE looks toward stage left , then back toward T.V. ) DODGE All right . HALIE 'S VOICE What ? DODGE ( louder ) All right ! HALIE 'S VOICE Do n't scream . It 'll only get your coughing started . DODGE All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll get it . ( pause ) Bradley should be over later . DODGE Bradley ? HALIE 'S VOICE Yes . To cut your hair . DODGE My hair ? I do n't need my hair cut ! HALIE 'S VOICE It wo n't hurt ! p. 9 DODGE I do n't need it ! HALIE 'S VOICE It 's been more than two weeks Dodge . DODGE I do n't need it ! HALIE 'S VOICE I have to meet Father Dewis for lunch . DODGE You tell Bradley that if he shows up here with those clippers , I 'll kill him ! HALIE 'S VOICE I wo n't be very late . No later than four at the very latest . DODGE You tell him ! Last time he left me almost bald ! And I was n't even awake ! I was sleeping ! I woke up and he 'd already left ! HALIE 'S VOICE That 's not my fault ! DODGE You put him up to it ! HALIE 'S VOICE I never did ! DODGE You did too ! You had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpse for company ! Lower the ears a little ! Put up a little front ! Surprised you did n't tape a pipe to my mouth while you were at it ! That woulda ' looked nice ! Huh ? A pipe ? Maybe a bowler hat ! Maybe a copy of The Wall Street Journal casually placed on my lap ! HALIE 'S VOICE You always imagine the worst things of people ! DODGE That 's not the worst ! That 's the least of the worst ! p. 10 HALIE 'S VOICE I do n't need to hear it ! All day long I hear things like that and I do n't need to hear more . DODGE You better tell him ! HALIE 'S VOICE You tell him yourself ! He 's your own son . You should be able to talk to your own son . DODGE Not while I 'm sleeping ! He cut my hair while I was sleeping !

I 'm an invisible man ! HALIE 'S VOICE Do n't be ridiculous . DODGE He better not try it . That 's all I 've got to say . HALIE 'S VOICE Tilden will watch out for you . DODGE Tilden wo n't protect me from Bradley ! p. 11 HALIE 'S VOICE Tilden 's the oldest . He 'll protect you . DODGE Tilden ca n't even protect himself ! HALIE 'S VOICE Not so loud ! He 'll hear you . He 's right in the kitchen . DODGE ( yelling off left ) Tilden ! HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge , what are you trying to do ? DODGE ( yelling off left ) Tilden , get in here ! HALIE 'S VOICE Why do you enjoy stirring things up ? DODGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a terrible thing to say . DODGE Tilden ! HALIE 'S VOICE That 's the kind of statement that leads people right to the end of their rope . DODGE Tilden ! HALIE 'S VOICE It 's no wonder people turn to Christ ! DODGE TILDEN ! ! HALIE 'S VOICE It 's no wonder the messengers of God 's word are shouted down in public places ! DODGE TILDEN ! ! ! ! ( DODGE goes into a violent , spasmodic coughing attack as TILDEN enters from stage left , his arms loaded with fresh ears of corn . TILDEN is DODGE 'S oldest son , late forties , wears heavy construction boots , covered with mud , dark green work pants , a plaid shirt and a faded brown windbreaker . He has a butch haircut , wet from the rain . Something about him is profoundly burned out and displaced . He stops center stage with the ears of corn in his arms and just stares at DODGE until he slowly finishes his coughing attack . DODGE looks up at him slowly . He stares at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 12 HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge , if you do n't take that pill nobody 's going to force you . ( The two men ignore the voice . ) DODGE ( to TILDEN ) Where 'd you get that ? TILDEN Picked it . DODGE You picked all that ? ( TILDEN nods . ) DODGE You expecting company ? TILDEN No . DODGE Where 'd you pick it from ? TILDEN Right out back . DODGE Out back where ? TILDEN Right out in back . DODGE There 's nothing out there ! TILDEN There 's corn . DODGE There has n't been corn out there since about nineteen thirty-five ! That 's the last time I planted corn out there ! TILDEN It 's out there now . DODGE ( yelling at stairs ) Halie ! HALIE 'S VOICE Yes dear ! DODGE Tilden 's brought a whole bunch of corn in here ! There 's no corn out in back is there ? p. 13 TILDEN ( to himself ) There 's tons of corn . HALIE 'S VOICE Not that I know of ! DODGE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nineteen thirty-five ! DODGE ( to TILDEN ) That 's right . Nineteen thirty-five . TILDEN It 's out there now . DODGE You go and take that corn back to wherever you got it from ! TILDEN ( After pause , staring at DODGE ) It 's picked . I picked it all in the rain . Once it 's picked you ca n't put it back . DODGE I have n't had trouble with neighbors here for fifty-seven years . I do n't even know who the neighbors are ! And I do n't wan na know ! Now go put that corn back where it came from ! ( TILDEN stares at DODGE then walks slowly over to him and dumps all the corn on DODGE 'S lap and steps back . DODGE stares at the corn then back to TILDEN . Long pause . ) DODGE Are you having trouble here , Tilden ! Are you in some kind of trouble ? TILDEN I 'm not in any trouble . p. 14 DODGE You can tell me if you are . I 'm still your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DODGE I know you had a little trouble back in New Mexico . That 's why you came out here . TILDEN I never had any trouble . DODGE Tilden , your mother told me all about it . TILDEN What 'd she tell you ? ( TILDEN pulls some chewing tobacco out of his jacket and bites off a plug . ) DODGE I do n't have to repeat what she told me ! She told me all about it ! TILDEN Can I bring my chair in from the kitchen ? DODGE What ? TILDEN Can I bring in my chair from the kitchen ? DODGE Sure . Bring your chair in . ( TILDEN exits left . DODGE pushes all the corn off his lap onto the floor . He pulls the blanket off angrily and tosses it at one end of the sofa , pulls out the bottle and takes another swig . TILDEN enters again from left with a milking stool and a pail . DODGE hides the bottle quickly under the cushion before TILDEN sees it . TILDEN sets the stool down by the sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of on the floor . TILDEN starts picking up the ears of corn one at a time and husking them . He throws the husks and silk in the center of the stage and drops the ears into the pail each time he cleans one . He repeats this process as they talk. ) p. 15 DODGE ( after pause ) Sure is nice-looking corn . TILDEN It 's the best . DODGE Hybrid ? TILDEN What ? DODGE Some kinda fancy hybrid ? TILDEN You planted it . I do n't know what it is . DODGE ( pause ) Tilden , look , you ca n't stay here forever . You know that , do n't you ? TILDEN ( spits in spittoon ) I 'm not . DODGE I know you 're not . I 'm not worried about that . That 's not the reason I brought it up . TILDEN What 's the reason ? DODGE The reason is I 'm wondering what you 're gon na do . TILDEN You 're not worried about me , are you ? DODGE I 'm not worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't here . When I was in New Mexico . DODGE No , I was n't worried about you then either . TILDEN You shoulda worried about me then . p. 16 DODGE Why 's that ? You did n't do anything down there , did you ? TILDEN I did n't do anything . DODGE Then why should I have worried about you ? TILDEN Because I was lonely . DODGE Because you were lonely ? TILDEN Yeah . I was more lonely than I 've ever been before . DODGE Why was that ? TILDEN ( pause ) Could I have some of that whiskey you 've got ? DODGE What whiskey ? I have n't got any whiskey . TILDEN You 've got some under the sofa . DODGE I have n't got anything under the sofa ! Now mind your own damn business ! Jesus God , you come into the house outa the middle of nowhere , have n't heard or seen you in twenty years and suddenly you 're making accusations . TILDEN I 'm not making accusations . DODGE You 're accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not accusing you . DODGE You just got through telling me I had whiskey under the sofa ! p. 17 HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge ? DODGE ( to TILDEN ) Now she knows about it ! TILDEN She does n't know about it . HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge , are you talking to yourself down there ? DODGE I 'm talking to Tilden ! HALIE 'S VOICE Tilden 's down there ? DODGE He 's right here ! HALIE 'S VOICE What ? DODGE ( louder ) He 's right here ! HALIE 'S VOICE What 's he doing ? DODGE ( to TILDEN ) Do n't answer her . TILDEN ( to DODGE ) I 'm not doing anything wrong . DODGE I know you 're not . HALIE 'S VOICE What 's he doing down there ! DODGE ( to TILDEN ) Do n't answer . TILDEN I 'm not . HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge ! ( The men sit in silence . DODGE lights a cigarette . TILDEN keeps husking corn , spits tobacco now and then in spittoon. ) p. 18 HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to it that he does n't drink anything ! You 've got ta watch out for him . It 's our responsibility . He ca n't look after himself anymore , so we have to do it . Nobody else will do it . We ca n't just send him away somewhere . If we had lots of money we could send him away . But we do n't . We never will . That 's why we have to stay healthy . You and me . Nobody 's going to look after us . Bradley ca n't look after us . Bradley can hardly look after himself . I was always hoping that Tilden would look out for Bradley when they got older . After Bradley lost his leg . Tilden 's the oldest . I always thought he 'd be the one to take responsibility . I had no idea in the world that Tilden would be so much trouble . Who would 've dreamed . Tilden was an All-American , do n't forget . Do n't forget that . Fullback . Or quarterback . I forget which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) HALIE 'S VOICE Then when Tilden turned out to be so much trouble , I put all my hopes on Ansel . Of course Ansel was n't as handsome , but he was smart . He was the smartest probably . I think he probably was . Smarter than Bradley , that 's for sure . Did n't go and chop his leg off with a chain saw . Smart enough not to go and do that . I think he was smarter than Tilden too . Especially after Tilden got in all that trouble . Does n't take brains to go to jail . Anybody knows that . Course then when Ansel died that left us all alone . Same as being alone . No different . Same as if they 'd all died . He was the smartest . He could 've earned lots of money . Lots and lots of money . ( HALIE enters slowly from the top of the staircase as she continues talking . Just her feet are seen at first as she makes her way down the stairs , a step at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though in mourning . Black handbag , hat with a veil , and pulling on elbow length black gloves . She is about sixty-five with pure white hair . She remains absorbed in what she 's saying as she descends the stairs and does n't really notice the two men who continue sitting there as they were before she came down , smoking and husking. ) p. 19 HALIE He would 've took care of us , too . He would 've seen to it that we were repaid . He was like that . He was a hero . Do n't forget that . A genuine hero . Brave . Strong . And very intelligent . Ansel could 've been a great man . One of the greatest . I only regret that he did n't die in action . It 's not fitting for a man like that to die in a motel room . A soldier . He could 've won a medal . He could 've been decorated for valor . I 've talked to Father Dewis about putting up a plaque for Ansel . He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Ansel when he used to play basketball . Went to every game . Ansel was his favorite player . He even recommended to the City Council that they put up a statue of Ansel . A big , tall statue with a basketball in one hand and a rifle in the other . That 's how much he thinks of Ansel . ( HALIE reaches the stage and begins to wander around , still absorbed in pulling on her gloves , brushing lint off her dress and continuously talking to herself as the men just sit . ) HALIE Of course , he 'd still be alive today if he had n't married into the Catholics . The Mob . How in the world he never opened his eyes to that is beyond me . Just beyond me . Everyone around him could see the truth . Even Tilden . Tilden told him time and again . Catholic women are the Devil incarnate . He would n't listen . He was blind with love . Blind . I knew . Everyone knew . The wedding was more like a funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible black , greasy hair . The smell of cheap cologne . I think even the priest was wearing a pistol . When he gave her the ring I knew he was a dead man . I knew it . As soon as he gave her the ring . But then it was the honeymoon that killed him . The honeymoon . I knew he 'd never come back from the honeymoon . I kissed him and he felt like a corpse . All white . Cold . Icy blue lips . He never used to kiss like that . Never before . I knew then that she 'd cursed him . Taken his soul . I saw it in her eyes . She smiled at me with that Catholic sneer of hers . She told me with her eyes that she 'd murder him in his bed . Murder my son . She told me . And there was nothing I could do . Absolutely nothing . He was going with her , thinking he was free . Thinking it was love . What could I do ? I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell him that . He 'd have turned on me . Hated me . I could n't stand him hating me and then dying before he ever saw me again . Hating me in his death bed . Hating me and loving her ! How could I do that ? I had to let him go . I had to . I watched him leave . I watched him throw gardenias as he helped her into the limousine . I watched his face disappear behind the glass . ( She stops abruptly and stares at the corn husks . She looks around the space as though just waking up . She turns and looks hard at TILDEN and DODGE who continue sitting calmly . She looks again at the corn husks. ) p. 20 HALIE ( pointing to the husks ) What 's this in my house ! ( kicks husks ) What 's all this ! ( TILDEN stops husking and stares at her . ) HALIE ( to DODGE ) And you encourage him ! ( DODGE pulls blanket over him again . ) DODGE You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( TILDEN starts husking again . ) DODGE Not in Florida it 's not . HALIE We 're not in Florida ! DODGE It 's not raining at the race track . HALIE Have you been taking those pills ? Those pills always make you talk crazy . Tilden , has he been taking those pills ? TILDEN He has n't took anything . HALIE ( to DODGE ) What 've you been taking ? DODGE It 's not raining in California or Florida or the race track . Only in Illinois . This is the only place it 's raining . All over the rest of the world it 's bright golden sunshine . ( HALIE goes to the night table next to the sofa and checks the bottle of pills. ) p. 21 HALIE Which ones did you take ? Tilden , you must 've seen him take something . TILDEN He never took a thing . HALIE Then why 's he talking crazy ? TILDEN I 've been here the whole time . HALIE Then you 've both been taking something ! TILDEN I 've just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn anyway ? Why is the house suddenly full of corn ? DODGE Bumper crop ! HALIE ( moving center ) We have n't had corn here for over thirty years . TILDEN The whole back lot 's full of corn . Far as the eye can see . DODGE ( to HALIE ) Things keep happening while you 're upstairs , ya know . The world does n't stop just because you 're upstairs . Corn keeps growing . Rain keeps raining . HALIE I 'm not unaware of the world around me ! Thank you very much . It so happens that I have an over-all view from the upstairs . The back yard 's in plain view of my window . And there 's no corn to speak of . Absolutely none ! DODGE Tilden would n't lie . If he says there 's corn , there 's corn . p. 22 HALIE What 's the meaning of this corn Tilden ! TILDEN It 's a mystery to me . I was out in back there . And the rain was coming down . And I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold so much . I did n't mind the wet . So I was just walking . I was muddy but I did n't mind the mud so much . And I looked up . And I saw this stand of corn . In fact I was standing in it . So , I was standing in it . HALIE There is n't any corn outside , Tilden ! There 's no corn ! Now , you must 've either stolen this corn or you bought it . DODGE He does n't have any money . HALIE ( to TILDEN ) So you stole it ! TILDEN I did n't steal it . I do n't want to get kicked out of Illinois . I was kicked out of New Mexico and I do n't want to get kicked out of Illinois . HALIE You 're going to get kicked out of this house , Tilden , if you do n't tell me where you got that corn ! ( TILDEN starts crying softly to himself but keeps husking corn . Pause . ) DODGE ( to HALIE ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he got the corn ? Why 'd you have to go and tell him that ? p. 23 HALIE ( to DODGE ) It 's your fault you know ! You 're the one that 's behind all this ! I suppose you thought it 'd be funny ! Some joke ! Cover the house with corn husks . You better get this cleaned up before Bradley sees it . DODGE Bradley 's not getting in the front door ! HALIE ( kicking husks , striding back and forth ) Bradley 's going to be very upset when he sees this . He does n't like to see the house in disarray . He ca n't stand it when one thing is out of place . The slightest thing . You know how he gets . DODGE Bradley does n't even live here ! HALIE It 's his home as much as ours . He was born in this house ! DODGE He was born in a hog wallow . HALIE Do n't you say that ! Do n't you ever say that ! DODGE He was born in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's where he belongs ! He does n't belong in this house ! HALIE ( she stops ) I do n't know what 's come over you , Dodge . I do n't know what in the world 's come over you . You 've become an evil man . You used to be a good man . DODGE Six of one , a half dozen of another . p. 24 HALIE You sit here day and night , festering away ! Decomposing ! Smelling up the house with your putrid body ! Hacking your head off till all hours of the morning ! Thinking up mean , evil , stupid things to say about your own flesh and blood ! DODGE He 's not my flesh and blood ! My flesh and blood 's buried in the back yard ! ( They freeze . Long pause . The men stare at her . ) HALIE ( quietly ) That 's enough , Dodge . That 's quite enough . I 'm going out now . I 'm going to have lunch with Father Dewis . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least a plaque . ( She crosses to the door up right . She stops . ) HALIE If you need anything , ask Tilden . He 's the oldest . I 've left some money on the kitchen table . DODGE I do n't need anything . HALIE No , I suppose not . ( she opens the door and looks out through porch ) Still raining . I love the smell just after it stops . The ground . I wo n't be too late . ( She goes out door and closes it . She 's still visible on the porch as she crosses toward stage left screen door . She stops in the middle of the porch , speaks to DODGE but does n't turn to him. ) p. 25 HALIE Dodge , tell Tilden not to go out in the back lot anymore . I do n't want him back there in the rain . DODGE You tell him . He 's sitting right here . HALIE He never listens to me Dodge . He 's never listened to me in the past . DODGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him just like we used to now . Just like we always have . He 's still a child . DODGE I 'll watch him . HALIE Good . ( She crosses to screen door , left , takes an umbrella off a hook and goes out the door . The door slams behind her . Long pause . TILDEN husks corn , stares at pail . DODGE lights a cigarette , stares at T.V. ) TILDEN ( still husking ) You should n't a told her that . DODGE ( staring at T.V. ) What ? TILDEN What you told her . You know . DODGE What do you know about it ? TILDEN I know . I know all about it . We all know . DODGE So what difference does it make ? Everybody knows , everybody 's forgot . p. 26 TILDEN She has n't forgot . DODGE She should 've forgot . TILDEN It 's different for a woman . She could n't forget that . How could she forget that ? DODGE I do n't want to talk about it ! TILDEN What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about anything ! I do n't want to talk about troubles or what happened fifty years ago or thirty years ago or the race track or Florida or the last time I seeded the corn ! I do n't want to talk ! TILDEN You do n't wan na die do you ? DODGE No , I do n't wan na die either . TILDEN Well , you got ta talk or you 'll die . DODGE Who told you that ? TILDEN That 's what I know . I found that out in New Mexico . I thought I was dying but I just lost my voice . DODGE Were you with somebody ? TILDEN I was alone . I thought I was dead . DODGE Might as well have been . What 'd you come back here for ? TILDEN I did n't know where to go . p. 27 DODGE You 're a grown man . You should n't be needing your parents at your age . It 's unnatural . There 's nothing we can do for you now anyway . Could n't you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to make a living ? Support yourself ? What'd'ya come back here for ? You expect us to feed you forever ? TILDEN I did n't know where else to go . DODGE I never went back to my parents . Never . Never even had the urge . I was independent . Always independent . Always found a way . TILDEN I did n't know what to do . I could n't figure anything out . DODGE There 's nothing to figure out . You just forge ahead . What 's there to figure out ? ( TILDEN stands . ) TILDEN I do n't know . DODGE Where are you going ? TILDEN Out back . DODGE You 're not supposed to go out there . You heard what she said . Do n't play deaf with me ! TILDEN I like it out there . DODGE In the rain ? TILDEN Especially in the rain . I like the feeling of it . Feels like it always did . p. 28 DODGE You 're supposed to watch out for me . Get me things when I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need anything ! But I might . I might need something any second . Any second now . I ca n't be left alone for a minute ! ( DODGE starts to cough . ) TILDEN I 'll be right outside . You can just yell . DODGE ( between coughs ) No ! It 's too far ! You ca n't go out there ! It 's too far ! You might not ever hear me ! TILDEN ( moving to pills ) Why do n't you take a pill ? You want a pill ? ( DODGE coughs more violently , throws himself back against sofa , clutches his throat . TILDEN stands by helplessly . ) DODGE Water ! Get me some water ! ( TILDEN rushes off left . DODGE reaches out for the pills , knocking some bottles to the floor , coughing in spasms . He grabs a small bottle , takes out pills and swallows them . TILDEN rushes back on with a glass of water . DODGE takes it and drinks , his coughing subsides . ) TILDEN You all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILDEN moves in closer to him . DODGE sets glass of water on the night table . His coughing is almost gone. ) p. 29 TILDEN Why do n't you lay down for a while ? Just rest a little . ( TILDEN helps DODGE lay down on the sofa . Covers him with blanket . ) DODGE You 're not going outside are you ? TILDEN No . DODGE I do n't want to wake up and find you not here . TILDEN I 'll be here .

He moves with an exaggerated , almost mechanical limp . The squeaking sounds of leather and metal accompany his walk coming from the harness and hinges of the false leg .

Unwinds the cord and crosses to the lamp . He jabs his wooden leg behind the knee , causing it to bend at the joint and awkwardly kneels to plug the cord into a floor outlet . He pulls himself to his feet again by using the sofa as leverage . He moves to DODGE 'S head and again jabs his false leg . Goes down on one knee .

( HALIE appears outside the screen porch door , up left with FATHER DEWIS . She is wearing a bright yellow dress , no hat , white gloves and her arms are full of yellow roses . FATHER DEWIS is dressed in traditional black suit , white clerical collar and shirt . He is a very distinguished grey haired man in his sixties . They are both slightly drunk and feeling giddy . As they enter the porch through the screen door , DODGE pulls the rabbit fur coat over his head and hides . SHELLY stands again . DODGE drops the coat and whispers intensely to SHELLY . Neither HALIE nor FATHER DEWIS are aware of the people inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper ) You promised ! ( SHELLY sits on stairs again . DODGE pulls coat back over his head .

Are n't you afraid of being punished ? ( She giggles ) FATHER DEWIS Not by the Italians . They 're too busy punishing each other . ( They both break out in giggles . ) HALIE What about God ? FATHER DEWIS Well , prayerfully , God only hears what he wants to . That 's just between you and me of course . In our heart of hearts we know we 're every bit as wicked as the Catholics . ( They giggle again and reach the stage right door . ) HALIE Father , I never heard you talk like this in Sunday sermon . FATHER DEWIS Well , I save all my best jokes for private company . Pearls before swine you know . ( They enter the room laughing and stop when they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATHER DEWIS .

What in the name of Judas Priest is going on in this house ! ( She hands over the roses to FATHER DEWIS . ) HALIE Excuse me Father . ( HALIE crosses to DODGE , whips the coat off him and covers the wooden leg with it . BRADLEY stays asleep . ) HALIE You ca n't leave this house for a second without the Devil blowing in through the front door ! DODGE Gim me back that coat !

He 's fully clothed . BRADLEY sits up with a jerk when the blanket comes off him . ) HALIE ( as she tosses blanket ) Here ! Use this ! It 's yours anyway ! Ca n't you take care of yourself for once ! BRADLEY ( yelling at HALIE ) Gim me that blanket ! Gim me back that blanket ! That 's my blanket ! ( HALIE crosses back toward FATHER DEWIS who just stands there with the roses . BRADLEY thrashes helplessly on the sofa trying to reach blanket . DODGE hides himself deeper in blanket . SHELLY looks on from staircase , still holding cup and saucer. ) p. 88 HALIE Believe me , Father , this is not what I had in mind when I invited you in . FATHER DEWIS Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could n't face real life . ( He laughs self-consciously . HALIE notices SHELLY again and crosses over to her . SHELLY stays sitting .

I 've had enough ! ( BRADLEY slowly recoils , lies back down on sofa , turns his back toward HALIE and whimpers softly . HALIE directs her attention to SHELLY again .

HALIE Well , did he drink it ? SHELLY No . HALIE Did you drink it ? p. 89 SHELLY Yes . ( HALIE stares at her . Long pause .

I. I really  --  HALIE We still have some whiskey , do n't we ? ( DODGE slowly pulls the blanket down off his head and looks toward FATHER DEWIS . SHELLY stands . ) SHELLY Listen , I do n't drink or anything . I just  --  ( HALIE turns toward SHELLY viciously . ) HALIE You sit back down ! ( SHELLY sits again on stair . HALIE turns again to DEWIS . ) HALIE I think we have plenty of whiskey left ! Do n't we Father ? FATHER DEWIS Well , yes . I think so . You 'll have to get it . My hands are full . ( HALIE giggles . Reaches into DEWIS 'S pockets , searching for bottle . She smells the roses as she searches . DEWIS stands stiffly . DODGE watches HALIE closely as she looks for bottle. ) p. 90 HALIE The most incredible things , roses ! Are n't they incredible , Father ? FATHER DEWIS Yes . Yes they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . Just magnificent ! The smell . We 'll have to put some at the foot of Ansel 's statue . On the day of the unveiling . ( HALIE finds a silver flask of whiskey in DEWIS 'S vest pocket . She pulls it out . DODGE looks on eagerly . HALIE crosses to DODGE , opens the flask and takes a sip . ) HALIE ( to DODGE ) Ansel 's getting a statue , Dodge . Did you know that ? Not a plaque but a real live statue . A full bronze . Tip to toe . A basketball in one hand and a rifle in the other . BRADLEY ( his back to HALIE ) He never played basketball ! HALIE You shut up , Bradley ! You shut up about Ansel ! Ansel played basketball better than anyone ! And you know it ! He was an All American ! There 's no reason to take the glory away from others . ( HALIE turns away from BRADLEY , crosses back toward DEWIS sipping on the flask and smiling . ) HALIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the greatest . p. 91 FATHER DEWIS I remember Ansel . HALIE Of course ! You remember . You remember how he could play . ( she turns toward SHELLY ) Of course , nowadays they play a different brand of basketball . More vicious . Is n't that right , dear ? SHELLY I do n't know . ( HALIE crosses to SHELLY , sipping on flask . She stops in front of SHELLY . ) HALIE Much , much more vicious . They smash into each other . They knock each other 's teeth out . There 's blood all over the court . Savages . ( HALIE takes the cup from SHELLY and pours whiskey into it . ) HALIE They do n't train like they used to . Not at all . They allow themselves to run amuck . Drugs and women . Women mostly . ( HALIE hands the cup of whiskey back to SHELLY slowly . SHELLY takes it . ) HALIE Mostly women . Girls . Sad , pathetic little girls . ( she crosses back to FATHER DEWIS ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Father ? An indication of where we stand ? FATHER DEWIS I suppose so , yes . HALIE Yes . A sort of a bad omen . Our youth becoming monsters . p. 92 FATHER DEWIS Well , I uh  --  HALIE Oh you can disagree with me if you want to , Father . I 'm open to debate . I think argument only enriches both sides of the question do n't you ? ( she moves toward DODGE ) I suppose , in the long run , it does n't matter . When you see the way things deteriorate before your very eyes . Everything running down hill . It 's kind of silly to even think about youth . FATHER DEWIS No , I do n't think so . I think it 's important to believe in certain things . HALIE Yes . Yes , I know what you mean . I think that 's right . I think that 's true . ( she looks at DODGE ) Certain basic things . We ca n't shake certain basic things . We might end up crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . You can see how mad he is . ( DODGE covers his head with the blanket again . HALIE takes a single rose from DEWIS and moves slowly over to DODGE . ) HALIE We ca n't not believe in something . We ca n't stop believing . We just end up dying if we stop . Just end up dead . ( HALIE throws the rose gently onto DODGE 'S blanket . It lands between his knees and stays there . Long pause as HALIE stares at the rose . SHELLY stands suddenly . HALIE does n't turn to her but keeps staring at rose. ) p. 93 SHELLY ( to HALIE ) Do n't you wan na ' know who I am ! Do n't you wan na know what I 'm doing here ! I 'm not dead ! ( SHELLY crosses toward HALIE . HALIE turns slowly toward her . ) HALIE Did you drink your whiskey ? SHELLY No ! And I 'm not going to either ! HALIE Well that 's a firm stand . It 's good to have a firm stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just trying to put all this together . ( HALIE laughs and crosses back to DEWIS . ) HALIE ( to DEWIS ) Surprises , surprises ! Did you have any idea we 'd be returning to this ? SHELLY I came here with your Grandson for a little visit ! A little innocent friendly visit . HALIE My Grandson ? SHELLY Yes ! That 's right . The one no one remembers . HALIE ( to DEWIS ) This is getting a little far fetched . SHELLY I told him it was stupid to come back here . To try to pick up from where he left off . HALIE Where was that ? p. 94 SHELLY Wherever he was when he left here ! Six years ago ! Ten years ago ! Whenever it was . I told him nobody cares . HALIE Did n't he listen ? SHELLY No ! No he did n't . We had to stop off at every tiny little meatball town that he remembered from his boyhood ! Every stupid little donut shop he ever kissed a girl in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever broke a bone on . HALIE ( suddenly alarmed , to DODGE ) Where 's Tilden ? SHELLY Do n't ignore me ! HALIE DODGE ! Where 's Tilden gone ? ( SHELLY moves violently toward HALIE . ) SHELLY ( to HALIE ) I 'm talking to you ! ( BRADLEY sits up fast on the sofa , SHELLY backs away . ) BRADLEY ( to SHELLY ) Do n't you yell at my mother ! HALIE Dodge ! ( she kicks DODGE ) I told you not to let Tilden out of your sight ! Where 's he gone to ? DODGE Gim me a drink and I 'll yell ya ' . FATHER DEWIS Halie , maybe this is n't the right time for a visit . ( HALIE crosses back to DEWIS. ) p. 95 HALIE ( to DEWIS ) I never should 've left . I never , never should 've left ! Tilden could be anywhere by now ! Anywhere ! He 's not in control of his faculties . Dodge knew that . I told him when I left here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRADLEY reaches down , grabs DODGE 'S blanket and yanks it off him . He lays down on sofa and pulls the blanket over his head . ) DODGE He 's got my blanket again ! He 's got my blanket ! HALIE ( turning to BRADLEY ) Bradley ! Bradley , put that blanket back ! ( HALIE moves toward BRADLEY . SHELLY suddenly throws the cup and saucer against the stage right door . DEWIS ducks . The cup and saucer smash into pieces . HALIE stops , turns toward SHELLY . Everyone freezes . BRADLEY slowly pulls his head out from under blanket , looks toward stage right door , then to SHELLY . SHELLY stares at HALIE . DEWIS cowers with roses . SHELLY moves slowly toward HALIE . Long pause . SHELLY speaks softly . ) SHELLY ( to HALIE ) I do n't like being ignored . I do n't like being treated like I 'm not here . I did n't like it when I was a kid and I still do n't like it . p. 96 BRADLEY ( sitting up on sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . Not a thing . You 're not the police are you ? You 're not the government . You 're just some prostitute that Tilden brought in here . HALIE Language ! I wo n't have that language in my house ! SHELLY ( to BRADLEY ) You stuck your hand in my mouth and you call me a prostitute ! HALIE Bradley ! Did you put your hand in her mouth ? I 'm ashamed of you . I ca n't leave you alone for a minute . BRADLEY I never did . She 's lying ! FATHER DEWIS Halie , I think I 'll be running along now . I 'll just put the roses in the kitchen . ( DEWIS moves toward stage left . HALIE stops him . ) HALIE Do n't go now , Father ! Not now . BRADLEY I never did anything , mom ! I never touched her ! She propositioned me ! And I turned her down . I turned her down flat ! ( SHELLY suddenly grabs her coat off the wooden leg and takes both the leg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom ! Mom ! She 's got my leg ! She 's taken my leg ! I never did anything to her ! She 's stolen my leg ! ( BRADLEY reaches pathetically in the air for his leg . SHELLY sets it down for a second , puts on her coat fast and picks the leg up again . DODGE starts coughing softly ) p. 97 HALIE ( to SHELLY ) I think we 've had about enough of you young lady . Just about enough . I do n't know where you came from or what you 're doing here but you 're no longer welcome in this house . SHELLY ( laughs , holds leg ) No longer welcome ! BRADLEY Mom ! That 's my leg ! Get my leg back ! I ca n't do anything without my leg . ( BRADLEY keeps making whimpering sounds and reaching for his leg . ) HALIE Give my son back his leg . Right this very minute ! ( DODGE starts laughing softly to himself in between coughs . ) HALIE ( to DEWIS ) Father , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be terrorized in my own house ! BRADLEY Gim me back my leg ! HALIE Oh , shut up Bradley ! Just shut up ! You do n't need your leg now ! Just lay down and shut up ! ( BRADLEY whimpers . Lays down and pulls blanket around him . He keeps one arm outside blanket , reaching out toward his wooden leg . DEWIS cautiously approaches SHELLY with the roses in his arms . SHELLY clutches the wooden leg to her chest as though she 's kidnapped it. ) p. 98 FATHER DEWIS ( to SHELLY ) Now , honestly dear , would n't it be better to try to talk things out ? To try to use some reason ? SHELLY There is n't any reason here ! I ca n't find a reason for anything . FATHER DEWIS There 's nothing to be afraid of . These are all good people . All righteous people . SHELLY I 'm not afraid ! FATHER DEWIS But this is n't your house . You have to have some respect . SHELLY You 're the strangers here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FATHER DEWIS Halie , please . Let me handle this . SHELLY Do n't come near me ! Do n't anyone come near me . I do n't need any words from you . I 'm not threatening anybody . I do n't even know what I 'm doing here . You all say you do n't remember Vince , okay , maybe you do n't . Maybe it 's Vince that 's crazy . Maybe he 's made this whole family thing up . I do n't even care anymore . I was just coming along for the ride . I thought it 'd be a nice gesture . Besides , I was curious . He made all of you sound familiar to me . Every one of you . For every name , I had an image . Every time he 'd tell me a name , I 'd see the person . In fact , each of you was so clear in my mind that I actually believed it was you . I really believed when I walked through that door that the people who lived here would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't recognize any of you . Not one . Not even the slightest resemblance . p. 99 FATHER DEWIS Well you can hardly blame others for not fulfilling your hallucination . SHELLY It was no hallucination ! It was more like a prophecy . You believe in prophecy , do n't you ? HALIE Father , there 's no point in talking to her any further . We 're just going to have to call the police . BRADLEY No ! Do n't get the police in here . We do n't want the police in here . This is our home . SHELLY That 's right . Bradley 's right . Do n't you usually settle your affairs in private ? Do n't you usually take them out in the dark ? Out in the back ? BRADLEY You stay out of our lives ! You have no business interfering ! SHELLY I do n't have any business period . I got nothing to lose . ( She moves around , staring at each of them . ) BRADLEY You do n't know what we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 've got a secret . You 've all got a secret . It 's so secret in fact , you 're all convinced it never happened . ( HALIE moves to DEWIS ) HALIE Oh , my God , Father ! DODGE ( laughing to himself ) She thinks she 's going to get it out of us . She thinks she 's going to uncover the truth of the matter . Like a detective or something . p. 100 BRADLEY I 'm not telling her anything ! Nothing 's wrong here ! Nothing 's ever been wrong ! Everything 's the way it 's supposed to be ! Nothing ever happened that 's bad ! Everything is all right here ! We 're all good people ! DODGE She thinks she 's gon na suddenly bring everything out into the open after all these years . FATHER DEWIS ( to SHELLY ) Ca n't you see that these people want to be left in peace ? Do n't you have any mercy ? They have n't done anything to you . DODGE She wants to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it , is n't it ? You 'd like to get right down to bedrock ? You want me to tell ya ' ? You want me to tell ya ' what happened ? I 'll tell ya ' . I might as well . BRADLEY No ! Do n't listen to him . He does n't remember anything ! DODGE I remember the whole thing from start to finish . I remember the day he was born . ( pause ) HALIE Dodge , if you tell this thing  --  if you tell this , you 'll be dead to me . You 'll be just as good as dead . DODGE That wo n't be such a big change , Halie . See this girl , this girl here , she wants to know . She wants to know something more . And I got this feeling that it does n't make a bit a ' difference . I 'd sooner tell it to a stranger than anybody else . p. 101 BRADLEY ( to DODGE ) We made a pact ! We made a pact between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember any pact . BRADLEY ( to SHELLY ) See , he does n't remember anything . I 'm the only one in the family who remembers . The only one . And I 'll never tell you ! SHELLY I 'm not so sure I want to find out now . DODGE ( laughing to himself ) Listen to her ! Now she 's runnin ' scared ! SHELLY I 'm not scared ! ( DODGE stops laughing , long pause . DODGE stares at her . ) DODGE You 're not huh ? Well , that 's good . Because I 'm not either . See , we were a well established family once . Well established . All the boys were grown . The farm was producing enough milk to fill Lake Michigan twice over . Me and Halie here were pointed toward what looked like the middle part of our life . Everything was settled with us . All we had to do was ride it out . Then Halie got pregnant again . Outa ' the middle a ' nowhere , she got pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . We had enough boys already . In fact , we had n't been sleepin ' in the same bed for about six years . p. 102 HALIE ( moving toward stairs ) I 'm not listening to this ! I do n't have to listen to this ! DODGE ( stops HALIE ) Where are you going ! Upstairs ! You 'll just be listenin ' to it upstairs ! You go outside , you 'll be listenin ' to it outside . Might as well stay here and listen to it . ( HALIE stays by stairs ) BRADLEY If I had my leg you would n't be saying this . You 'd never get away with it if I had my leg . DODGE ( pointing to SHELLY ) She 's got your leg . ( laughs ) She 's gon na keep your leg too . ( to SHELLY ) She wants to hear this . Do n't you ? SHELLY I do n't know . DODGE Well even if ya ' do n't I 'm gon na ' tell ya ' . ( pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it . I let her have it on her own . All the other boys I had had the best doctors , best nurses , everything . This one I let her have by herself . This one hurt real bad . Almost killed her , but she had it anyway . It lived , see . It lived . It wanted to grow up in this family . It wanted to be just like us . It wanted to be a part of us . It wanted to pretend that I was its father . She wanted me to believe in it . Even when everyone around us knew . Everyone . All our boys knew . Tilden knew . p. 103 HALIE You shut up ! Bradley , make him shut up ! BRADLEY I ca n't . DODGE Tilden was the one who knew . Better than any of us . He 'd walk for miles with that kid in his arms . Halie let him take it . All night sometimes . He 'd walk all night out there in the pasture with it . Talkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear him singing to it . He 'd make up stories . He 'd tell that kid all kinds a ' stories . Even when he knew it could n't understand him . Could n't understand a word he was sayin ' . Never would understand him . We could n't let a thing like that continue . We could n't allow that to grow up right in the middle of our lives . It made everything we 'd accomplished look like it was nothin ' . Everything was cancelled out by this one mistake . This one weakness . SHELLY So you killed him ? DODGE I killed it . I drowned it . Just like the runt of a litter . Just drowned it . ( HALIE moves toward BRADLEY ) HALIE ( to BRADLEY ) Ansel would 've stopped him ! Ansel would 've stopped him from telling these lies ! He was a hero ! A man ! A whole man ! What 's happened to the men in this family ! Where are the men ! ( Suddenly VINCE comes crashing through the screen porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone but DODGE and BRADLEY back away from the porch and stare at VINCE who has landed on his stomach on the porch in a drunken stupor . He is singing loudly to himself and hauls himself slowly to his feet . He has a paper shopping bag full of empty booze bottles . He takes them out one at a time as he sings and smashes them at the opposite end of the porch , behind the solid interior door , stage right . SHELLY moves slowly toward stage right , holding wooden leg and watching VINCE. ) p. 104 VINCE ( singing loudly as he hurls bottles ) " From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli . We will fight our country 's battles on the land and on the sea . " ( He punctuates the words " Montezuma , " " Tripoli , " " battles " and " sea " with a smashed bottle each . He stops throwing for a second , stares toward stage right of the porch , shades his eyes with his hand as though looking across to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yells across the space of the porch to an imaginary army . The others watch in terror and expectation . ) VINCE ( to imagined Army ) Have you had enough over there ! ' Cause there 's a lot more here where that came from ! ( pointing to paper bag full of bottles ) A helluva lot more ! We got enough over here to blow ya ' from here to Kingdomcome ! ( He takes another bottle , makes high whistling sound of a bomb and throws it toward stage right porch . Sound of bottle smashing against wall . This should be the actual smashing of bottles and not tape sound . He keeps yelling and heaving bottles one after another . VINCE stops for a while , breathing heavily from exhaustion . Long silence as the others watch him . SHELLY approaches tentatively in VINCE 'S direction , still holding BRADLEY 'S wooden leg. ) p. 105 SHELLY ( after silence ) Vince ? ( VINCE turns toward her . Peers through screen . ) VINCE Who ? What ? Vince who ? Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen from the porch and stares in at everyone . ) DODGE Where 's my goddamn bottle ! VINCE ( looking in at DODGE ) What ? Who is that ? DODGE It 's me ! Your Grandfather ! Do n't play stupid with me ! Where 's my two bucks ! VINCE Your two bucks ? ( HALIE moves away from DEWIS , upstage , peers out at VINCE , trying to recognize him . ) HALIE Vincent ? Is that you , Vincent ? ( SHELLY stares at HALIE then looks out at VINCE . ) VINCE ( from porch ) Vincent who ? What is this ! Who are you people ? SHELLY ( to HALIE ) Hey , wait a minute . Wait a minute ! What 's going on ? HALIE ( moving closer to porch screen ) We thought you were a murderer or something . Barging in through the door like that . p. 106 VINCE I am a murderer ! Do n't underestimate me for a minute ! I 'm the Midnight Strangler ! I devour whole families in a single gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . HALIE backs away . ) SHELLY ( approaching Halie ) You mean you know who he is ? HALIE Of course I know who he is ! That 's more than I can say for you . BRADLEY ( sitting up on sofa ) You get off our front porch you creep ! What 're you doing out there breaking bottles ? Who are these foreigners anyway ! Where did they come from ? VINCE Maybe I should come in there and break them ! HALIE ( moving toward porch ) Do n't you dare ! Vincent , what 's got into you ! Why are you acting like this ? VINCE Maybe I should come in there and usurp your territory ! ( HALIE turns back toward DEWIS and crosses to him . ) HALIE ( to DEWIS ) Father , why are you just standing around here when everything 's falling apart ? Ca n't you rectify this situation ? ( DODGE laughs , coughs. ) p. 107 FATHER DEWIS I 'm just a guest here , Halie . I do n't know what my position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( VINCE starts throwing more bottles as things continue . ) BRADLEY If I had my leg I 'd rectify it ! I 'd rectify him all over the goddamn highway ! I 'd pull his ears out if I could reach him ! ( BRADLEY sticks his fist through the screening of the porch and reaches out for VINCE , grabbing at him and missing . VINCE jumps away from BRADLEY 'S hand . ) VINCE Aaaah ! Our lines have been penetrated ! Tentacled animals ! Beasts from the deep ! ( VINCE strikes out at BRADLEY 'S hand with a bottle . BRADLEY pulls his hand back inside . ) SHELLY Vince ! Knock it off will ya ' ! I want to get out of here ! ( VINCE pushes his face against screen , looks in at SHELLY . ) VINCE ( to SHELLY ) Have they got you prisoner in there , dear ?

VINCE watches her through the screen. ) p. 108 VINCE ( to SHELLY ) We 'll have to negotiate . Make some kind of a deal . Prisoner exchange or something . A few of theirs for one of ours . Small price to pay if you ask me . ( SHELLY crosses toward stage right door with overcoat and case . ) SHELLY Just go and get the car ! I 'm coming out there now . We 're going to leave .

He 'd watch over all of us . ( DEWIS takes her all the way up the stairs . They disappear above . VINCE is now climbing through the porch screen onto the sofa . BRADLEY crashes off the sofa , holding tight to his blanket , keeping it wrapped around him . SHELLY is outside on the porch . VINCE holds the knife in his teeth once he gets the hole wide enough to climb through .

So I 'll settle my affairs once and for all . ( As DODGE proclaims his last will and testament , VINCE climbs into the room , knife in mouth , and strides slowly around the space , inspecting his inheritance . He casually notices BRADLEY as he crawls toward his leg . VINCE moves to the leg and keeps pushing it with his foot so that it 's out of BRADLEY 'S reach then goes on with his inspection . He picks up the roses and carries them around smelling them . SHELLY can be seen outside on the porch , moving slowly center and staring in at VINCE .

VINCE takes the knife out of his mouth and smells the roses . He 's facing toward audience and does n't turn around to SHELLY . He folds up knife and pockets it. ) p. 111 SHELLY ( from porch ) I 'm leaving , Vince . Whether you come or not , I 'm leaving .

I drove all night . Clear to the Iowa border . The old man 's two bucks sitting right on the seat beside me . It never stopped raining the whole time . Never stopped once . I could see myself in the windshield . My face . My eyes . I studied my face . Studied everything about it . As though I was looking at another man . As though I could see his whole race behind him . Like a mummy 's face . I saw him dead and alive at the same time . In the same breath . In the windshield , I watched him breathe as though he was frozen in time . And every breath marked him . Marked him forever without him knowing . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . Same bones . Same eyes . Same nose . Same breath . And his father 's face changed to his Grandfather 's face . And it went on like that . Changing . Clear on back to faces I 'd never seen before but still recognized . Still recognized the bones underneath . The eyes . The breath . The mouth . I followed my family clear into Iowa . Every last one . Straight into the Corn Belt and further . Straight back as far as they 'd take me . Then it all dissolved . Everything dissolved .

Vince lifts the blanket , then covers his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staring at DODGE 'S body . Long pause . VINCE places the roses on DODGE 'S chest then lays down on the sofa , arms folded behind his head , staring at the ceiling . His body is in the same relationship to DODGE 'S . After a while HALIE 'S voice is heard coming from above the staircase . The lights start to dim almost imperceptibly as HALIE speaks . VINCE keeps staring at the ceiling. ) p. 114 HALIE 'S VOICE Dodge ? Is that you Dodge ? Tilden was right about the corn you know . I 've never seen such corn . Have you taken a look at it lately ? Tall as a man already . This early in the year . Carrots too . Potatoes . Peas . It 's like a paradise out there , Dodge . You ought a ' take a look . A miracle . I 've never seen it like this . Maybe the rain did something . Maybe it was the rain . ( As HALIE keeps talking off stage , TILDEN appears from stage left , dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands are covered with mud . In his hands he carries the corpse of a small child at chest level , staring down at it . The corpse mainly consists of bones wrapped in muddy , rotten cloth . He moves slowly downstage toward the staircase , ignoring VINCE on the sofa . VINCE keeps staring at the ceiling as though TILDEN was n't there . As HALIE 'S VOICE continues , TILDEN slowly makes his way up the stairs . His eyes never leave the corpse of the child . The lights keep fading . ) HALIE 'S VOICE Good hard rain . Takes everything straight down deep to the roots . The rest takes care of itself . You ca n't force a thing to grow . You ca n't interfere with it . It 's all hidden . It 's all unseen . You just got ta wait til it pops up out of the ground . Tiny little shoot . Tiny little white shoot . All hairy and fragile . Strong though . Strong enough to break the earth even . It 's a miracle , Dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my whole life . Maybe it 's the sun . Maybe that 's it . Maybe it 's the sun . ( TILDEN disappears above . Silence . Lights go to black. )
