" Go home and get some rest , " the son told the father . The father did leave his office and clamber into his car , but instead of heading home he slowly circled the block until he was certain all the reporters had departed .

He had berated it for its attitude , which he thought lackadaisical , and he had berated it for its performance , which he thought poor . and he was but partially mollified when he spoke with Gary Garland . " Do n't worry , coach , " Garland had told him . Still , the players suggested that their Thursday workout in Salt Lake he closed , and Ray Meyer concurred , and Joey Meyer delivered the news to interested people . hut then a television crew showed up , and Ray Meyer let them in , and then a pair of friends appeared , and they were admitted as well , and finally there were some ' Twirlers , who were also granted entrance .

" There would be a meetin g , then a final practice in front of some 6,000 people , and then a press conference with his starters for the massed media . When it ended , he climbed into a van , returned to his hotel , exhibited the stack of telegrams piled on a table I " This one 's In feet long " I , traveled to another hotel for the coin flip that would determine which team wore what colored uniforms , attended a cocktail party , left early , and then entertained family and friends in his suite until well past midnight .
