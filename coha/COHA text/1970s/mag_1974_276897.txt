As tensions mount in Southern Europe , Albanian warplanes drop nuclear bombs on Naples . Tel Aviv is destroyed by a nuclear attack from an unidentified country ; Egyptian atomic bombs devastate London and Washington ; China , the Soviet Union , the U.S. and Britain are drawn into war . Soon mushroom clouds cover nearly the entire planet . <P> That chilling plot for the end of the world was sketched nearly two decades ago by Nevil Shute in his bestselling novel On the Beach . At the time , it seemed farfetched . Only three nations possessed atomic weapons . Now six nations have them , at least a couple of dozen other countries have the capability to develop them - and suddenly Shute 's scenario seems frighteningly possible . <P> Even if the Soviet Union and the U.S. agree on new restrictions on their nuclear arms at the continuing Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ( which after four years have not yet achieved any reduction in atomic arsenals ) , nuclear technology and resources are now so plentiful that almost any country determined to do so can build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect that this month caused the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to move the minute hand of its " doomsday clock " three minutes closer to midnight ( TIME , Sept. 2 ) . <P> For a decade , membership in the club remained constant , with China in 1964 the last to join the U.S. ( 1945 ) , the Soviet Union ( 1949 ) , Britain ( 1952 ) and France ( 1960 ) . After its atomic explosion last May , India is now the world 's sixth nuclear power . Others will certainly follow . Experts note that ten countries already have the economic and scientific resources to develop the bomb before the end of the decade ( though none has yet announced plans to do so ) : Argentina , Brazil , Iran , Israel , Italy , Japan , Pakistan , South Africa , South Korea and West Germany . <P> Naive Belief . Japan , the one country to have experienced a nuclear attack , has an understandable aversion to developing atomic weapons . If the Japanese or the Canadians , who sold India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wanted a nuclear capability , though , they could easily have it , as could the West Germans , who renounced all nuclear weapons in 1956 as a condition for joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Israel also could quickly become a nuclear power . Since the late 1950s it has had a large atomic reactor at Dimona in the Negev desert ; the reactor has been turning out enough fissionable material over the past ten years to build at least one Hiroshima-size bomb annually . Because a bomb can be physically assembled in a matter of weeks if all materials are ready , Israel for all practical purposes could already have a nuclear arsenal of about 13 bombs . <P> Fourteen other nations are potential members of the club : Algeria , Bangladesh , Belgium , Chile , Colombia , Indonesia , Libya , North Korea , Portugal , Saudi Arabia , Spain , Switzerland , Turkey and Venezuela . Though they are not nearly as advanced as the first group , they could become atomic powers by the end of the century-and sooner if they decide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
