the coats bulging in a closet at a cocktail party . TRB 's readers must disagree , especially with the adverse judgment on his style . To see the clear merit of that style , we have only to compare the turgidities produced by most columnists , not to mention book reviewers , with TRB 's lean leads . From a feast , here is a teasing sample . McNamara testifying . Theoretically on foreign aid ; actually , Vietnam . Strong man . Whiz kid . Power drive ! Facts , facts , facts . They pour out . Likable . Rimless glasses . Bulldog face . Apolitical . What luck to have him in the Defense Department . How awful to have him in the White House ! This book is variously rewarding . It is at once a lively chronicle of the modern American presidency , a primer to the structural flaws of our political system , a guide to the vicissitudes of liberal ideas and legislation since the New Deal , and an eloquent expression of the liberal spirit itself during those years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meander ; it is organized chronologically around the presidencies since the war and thematically around a set of concerns TNR readers will recognize from their weekly dose of TRB ? concerns that , in this expanded form , are given a satisfyingly full exposition . Beyond all this , Views and Perspectives on the Presidency is a work of style , wit , and moral penetration , which abounds in arresting anecdotes and which features superb cameo portraits of political personages from FDR to Robert Kennedy . There is one other and far odder part of the book . This part , which amounts to a kind of subtext , involves the evocation of four historic occasions as witnessed by a reporter waiting for the news outside the White House . The occasions are December 7 , 1941 , the death of FDR , the funeral of John Kennedy , and the resignation of Richard Nixon . In the course of this book the reader encounters these scenes again and again ; like fragments of an unciphered dream , they seem to haunt the author 's memory . Built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , these White House scenes achieve the sort of highly elaborated quality literary critics call symbolic . Their cumulative effect is extraordinary . Through these symbolic moments , TRB seems to be offering us an imaginative vision not merely of the events themselves but of the whole of our recent history . Of course TRB would not make such a grandiose claim for his columns ; his downright persona would not permit it . Instead , with predictable modesty , he writes : We never wrote one that could not have been better . A lot of our predictions that Dewey would beat Truman , that Nixon would end the war in Vietnam soon after his election look silly . We ca n't believe we ever influenced anybody very much , if at all , though it is nice to remember that JFK read us regularly . Personally , we deplore this stacatto literary style which is an outgrowth of an effort , we suppose , to cram too many ideas into 800 words , like Sometimes an element of self-parody enters in , as in this portrait of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He plays the fiddle . He guides the Senate . Once he was just a kleagle . Then he became a senator . Then he beat Teddy Kennedy . Now he lectures the vice president . Now he tells President Carter to fire Lance . President Carter fires Lance . What will Senator Byrd do next ? Nobody knows . But watch him . More often the drive for compression results in wonderfully distilling verbs and phrases . We read , for example , about missiles capable of " crisping " cities thousands of miles away ; Senator Jenner is a man who has been " angry from the nipple on " ; that 23 percent of the people who supported Nixon to the last comprise " the Caligula quotient . " And so on . I make a point of TRB 's style because it is by means of this instrument of delight that he lulls his readers into listening to his favorite sermon : I mean , of course , the one on the deadlock of democracy created by the separation of executive and legislative power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deus ex machina of parliamentary democracy . Now to my mind , proposed alterations of this sort are among the most purely speculative labors in which an intelligence can lose itself , and when TRB starts down this path , I usually wince . It is n't that I think he 's wrong ; over the years he 's convinced me that the defects of our present system are real , and far outweigh its virtues . But I do think he is utopian , for it seems to me exceedingly unlikely that we will ever change our system , this side of revolution , and it is hard to imagine a revolution that would have that parliamentary system as one of the pressing items on its agenda . Now , after reading TRB in bulk , I still do think that on this issue he is utopian , but his case , in this expanded form , is concededly more powerful than ever . For just consider : five presidents in his lifetime have had their legislative programs blocked by Congresses of the opposite party or ideological tendency . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynicism that makes our system a democracy in memory only . The first president TRB saw destroyed in this way was Woodrow Wilson , and after reading these collected columns , I am convinced that Wilson offers the key to TRB 's political thought . For TRB , as he tells us , was one of Mr. Wilson 's " gawky boys " who fought in France for the Fourteen Points ( Strout volunteered ) , but who were betrayed by a Senate of the opposite party when it voted down the cardinal point of the 14 ? that which would have committed the US to the League of Nations . Under a parliamentary system , where Wilson would have had a governing majority , this could not have happened . With this betrayal as background , I think we can see why , like Woodrow Wilson , who wrote a book with that title , TRB decries " Congressional Government " ; why for him Pearl Harbor was not the day World War II began , but the day isolationism ended ; why , in the first column reproduced here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the country craves is a moral tonic . Announcement of specific , idealistic , post-war aims ? would help Mr. Roosevelt in the Congress ; it would help the men in the factories ; it might give the boys in the trenches a lot of help , too . Laugh if you want . But when a man dies , he wants to die for something important . And here in that last phrase I think we can catch the drama of Strout 's career . For clearly , he must have known numbers of gawky boys who died in France , killed for nothing , their sacrifices robbed of meaning by a perfidious Senate operating the malign constitutional machinery with which the founding fathers have burdened their posterity . I had thought that the parliamentary system was a crotchet of Strout 's ; now I see that it is a passion that grows out of the tragic experience of his generation . Once one sees this , TRB 's lonely , quixotic crusade becomes moving ; parliamentary democracy ? of all things ! ? suddenly carries a charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas have the same provenance as his commitment to parliamentary democracy , but they certainly wear the same high gloss of Wilsonian idealism . For the record , then , TRB believes , with Ronald Steel , " that America 's worth to the world will be measured not by the solutions she seeks to impose on others , but by the degree to which she achieves her ideals at home . " He thinks that poverty and race remain the main issues before the country , even in this " Age of Scarcity , " and that the Department of Defense should defend us with less money ( he is a marvel at the kind of moral arithmetic that can divide missiles into schools and turn tanks into warm lunches ) . TRB believes that planning " is not a dirty word , " that gun control is long overdue , that the tax system is what candidate Carter called it , a disgrace , but that we should be willing to pay more taxes to make our society more just . TRB is a liberal who dates from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cliched , as they are by many today , but as necessary and humane responses tophoto of Richard Strout the brutal challenges of the 20th century . These were the ideas , the causes , you believed in if you wanted to build what Barrington Moore has called " the decent society " ? a society from which the injustices due to the workings of social institutions have been eliminated . To me , TRB 's ideas seem attractive and right . But what impresses me even more , what makes me think that these ideas are not without influence on the moral life , is TRB 's way of holding them . For while he believes strongly in his ideas , and argues for them with cogency and verve , he does not scorn those who disagree with him , nor does he try to reduce their ideas to unsavory motives ? whether political , financial , or psychological ? in order to discredit them . In other words , he accepts honest differences . With superb intellectual grace , he presents a model of tolerance . What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being moralistic ; a reformer without being a prig . He says that anger is a reporter 's elixir , but his own anger is often in precarious balance with his sympathy , which extends to such unlikely people as Sherman Adams ( " who can see pride humbled without a tear or watch mistakes being exposed without himself being in the dock " ) , LBJ , even Richard Nixon . Instinctively , he 's for the underdog ; with Simone Weil , he suspects that justice is always a fugitive from the camp of victory . As a writer , he is never vicious , arrogant , or mocking , and is satiric only briefly , between the waves of more complex feeling . In a charming column he tells us that his parents ? " they were Protestants ; they were homogenous ; they were farmers " ? lived well into their 90s . His readers must hope that TRB , now a formidable 81 , will follow their example and continue to deepen and delight them for another 20 years .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
