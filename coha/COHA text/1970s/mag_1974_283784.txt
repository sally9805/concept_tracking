LAST RIGHTS by MARYA MANNES 150 pages . Morrow . $5.95 . <P> Not so long ago , discussion of death was largely a select European import - Camus , say , in The Myth of Sisyphus . Suddenly , death is an exceedingly popular topic in America . It is even an academic specialty : the University of Minnesota boasts a Center for Thanatological Studies , while U.C.L.A. has a Laboratory for the Study of Life-Threatening Behavior . On the lecture circuit , " the subject of death is now outdrawing the perennials-sex and politics , " writes Roman Catholic Theologian Daniel C. Maguire in the current issue of the Atlantic . Maguire 's essay describes a new genre he calls " the thanatology book . " <P> In one of the recent books in the category , Journalist-Novelist Marya Mannes has explored what may prove to be the most popular approach to death : treating it as a new civil rights issue . More than 40 years ago , Austrian Novelist and Playwright Stefan Zweig wrote : " Among the ' rights of man ' there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to croak when and where one pleases . " This bald manifesto might serve as the banner that Miss Mannes marches under . <P> In her latest novel , They , Miss Mannes composed a horror-fantasy about a brave new world in which the aging were liquidated in the name of youth cult . In Last Rights she argues for allowing the aging to liquidate themselves , to arrange their own end when they judge death preferable to life . At the conclusion of her essay , Miss Mannes , now in her middle 60s , presents her own legal document of instructions , including the proviso : " I do not wish to survive a stroke that impairs my ability to speak or move , nor any accident or disease resulting in vision too impaired to see or read , or in total deafness . If age and illness deny me these , I choose death . " <P> Confidently , disparagingly , she sketches the obvious alternatives . Should one perpetuate oneself at the tube end of " life-supporting " devices ? Obscene . Should one rock out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch of a nursing home ? " I 'd rather put a bullet through my head . " <P> More acceptable alternatives are hinted at . There is St. Christopher 's Hospice in London , where the dying are given " highs " on alcohol and heroin that kill pain and sometimes induce euphoria . There is the Maryland Psychiatric Center at Catonsville , where LSD is used as a kind of rites-of-passage drug , making death less alien while making the last chapter of life more tolerable-or so it is hoped . <P> Open Dying . But mostly Miss Mannes is pamphleteering for a new attitude toward death . Enough of " hypocrisy . " Enough of " evasion . " From childhood , death-shy Americans should be taught to confront the corpse : " Look at this face of the aunt you loved . She escaped her body . " Honesty is the key - are we doomed to have a book called Open Dying too ? At any rate , the best-prepared to die are those who " knew the score right from the beginning and talked of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
