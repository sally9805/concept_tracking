" My kingdom is not of this world , " Jesus said . To Jehovah 's Witnesses , who now number more than 2 million worldwide , that is a command to boycott all political activity . Various nations have found this irksome , but few have matched the violence of Malawi 's response . During a 1972 crackdown by President-for-life Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda , a Presbyterian elder , Malawi Witnesses were robbed , beaten , raped , even murdered . Thousands fled to neighboring Zambia , which shipped most of them back to Malawi . Eventually , about 34,000 found refuge in Portuguese Mozambique . <P> No sooner did Mozambique gain independence last June , however , than the new republic required everyone to join " dynamization groups " and bone up on Marxism . When the Witnesses balked , they were forced back to Malawi . There they have steadfastly refused to buy 34 cards that would make them members of Banda 's Congress Party . The penalty : loss of homes and jobs . Hundreds of Witnesses are dying of starvation or disease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
