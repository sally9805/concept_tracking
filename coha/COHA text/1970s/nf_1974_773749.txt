' But Michelangelo 's father was a man in a good position , and though doubtless the architects ' sons mentioned above were well trained by their father , other youths who were less fortunately placed had to pick up their knowledge as best they could , until their talents by good luck came to the notice of one of those noble patrons of the arts who could do so much for the career of a poor lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture as a rule because they showed a taste for drawing . Other studies which they pursued appear to have been geometry , perspective , mathematics , and mechanics . A few quotations from Vasari indicate the varied ways in which the chief architects of the Italian Renaissance acquired the rudiments of their technical training . Thus , Brunelleschi 's father perceiving that the mind of the boy was constantly intent on various intricate questions of art and mechanics , made him learn writing and arithmetic , and then placed him in the Guild of the Goldsmiths , that he might acquire design from a friend of his . ' 1 In boy-hood Andrea Verrocchio gave considerable attention to science , more especially to geometry , ' 2 and later ap-proached architecture by way of goldsmiths ' work and sculpture . Bramante found his principal pleasure in // architecture and the study of perspective ; he departed therefore from Castel Durante , and proceeded to Lom-bardy , repairing first to one city and then to another , working in each meanwhile as he best could ' .1 Of Bal-dassare Peruzzi it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , who practised the arts of design Andrea Sansovino and Michelangelo studied in the garden of Lorenzo de'Medici 's palace at Florence , where the interest of that powerful patron secured a career for them in later years . Michelangelo , who entered archi-tecture only as an old man , began his career as a successful faker ' of drawings and statues to represent antiques , resorting to ingenious tricks to make a drawing look old and to give bronze the appearance of having been long buried beneath the earth . The best account that Vasari gives us of an architect 's professional training relates to Bartolommeo Genga , already mentioned , who was himself an architect 's son . He was sent to school to learn Latin and remained there until he was eighteen . Then his father perceiving that he was more decidedly disposed to the arts of design than to letters , gave him permission to study these arts under his own care for about two years , and these being then concluded he then sent him to pursue the studies of design and painting in Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to his father 's office at Urbino , where he helped him with the drawings for a church . His father then , and only then , came to the conclusion that Bartolommeo showed an aptitude for architecture rather than painting , and after giving him some months training , including perspective , // sent him to Rome to the end that he might behold the wonderful buildings , both ancient and modern , which abound in that city ' .1 After four years measuring and drawing in Rome , he finally returned to Urbino , where he commenced practice under the patronage of the Duke . It will thus be seen that his training lasted over nine years , and that it was not completed until he was 27 or 28 years of age . In another passage Vasari tells us how , in his opinion , an architect should be qualified for his work . Architecture is to be adequately pursued only by such men as possess an excellent judgment , a good knowledge of design , or extensive practice in some such occupation as painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the habit of measuring figures , edifices , and bodies of similar character in their several members ; such as , for example , are columns , cornices , and basements , and to examine all these in their relative proportions , even to the most minute parti-culars of such parts as serve for embellishment alone , and for no other purpose . ' 2 Although Vasari elsewhere commends Michelangelo for breaking away from the bondage of Vitruvius and his kind , 3 the passage quoted makes it clear that an architect was expected in those days to be a close student of the antique . It is a remarkable fact that almost every famous architect whose life is described in detail by Vasari , even the poorest of them , somehow contrived to spend long periods , often many years , in measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome , and even in making restorations ' of the ruins . Brunelleschi went there with Donatello at about 25 years of age , sold a farm to provide funds , and when these were exhausted took up gem-setting in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the had climate of the Campagna put an end to his studies ; this being a frequent occurrence in Vasari 's lives . Bra-mante was not able to get to Rome till he was over fifty , when he had saved enough to settle there for the sole purpose of study.2 Fortunately he also picked up a large practice there . Raphael 's paintings display his wide knowledge of Roman architecture . Cronaca obtained his name ( chronicle ' ) from his constant talk in Florence about Roman antiquities .3 Falconetto spent twelve years studying the ruins of Rome , financing himself by working for other painters two or three days a week ; 4 he also travelled to Bola to study the Roman buildings there . Sanmicheli , an architect 's son , was sent to Rome in his sixteenth year , and his studies there were so much appre-ciated that they obtained for him an appointment in charge of the cathedral at Orvieto , with a most honour-able stipend ' .5 Other names might be added to this list . A quotation from Vasari shows how hard students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end that each of us might have drawings of every work , we did not copy the same thing on the same day , but different ones , and when night came we copied each other 's drawings for the purpose of saving time , and also to advance our studies ; nor did we ever breakfast in the morning , except on what we ate while standing , and that very frugally . ' Simone Mosca , whose home was at Settignano , managed to obtain employment in Rome as assistant to Antonio da Sangallo , and spent all his available holidays in measuring and sketching the ruins . ' For Rome was // the Mecca of the ambitious student , as of the practising architect , and every youth aspired to become assistant to an architect in Rome . The revival of Roman architecture , commonly called the Renaissance , was due primarily to Filippo Brunelleschi , who , when he first beheld the city , stood like one amazed , and seemed to have lost his wits ' . So he and his friend Donatello , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roman buildings and taking profiles of their cornices with wild enthusiasm . And as Filippo was free from all household cares , ' writes Vasari , he gave himself up so exclusively to his studies , that he took no time either to eat or sleep ; his every thought was of Architecture , which was then extinct : I mean the good old manner , and not the Gothic and barbarous one , which was much practised at that period . ' 1 Brunelleschi had two objects in mind when he began his studies , firstly to revive the use of Roman architecture , and secondly to discover among the ruins some method of constructing the dome of the cathedral at Florence , a problem which was baffling all the architects of that city , and which he , at the early age of twenty-five , had thus determined to solve . So , with the one purpose in view , he and Donatello excavated and measured and drew so assiduously that the local populace suspected them of being treasure-seekers ; and , on the other hand , Brunelleschi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of their vaulting , and the methods by which bricks and stones were cramped together by metal fastenings . Meanwhile his long study of the ruins had the result that he became capable of entirely reconstructing the city in his imaginaThe // tion , and of beholding Rome as she had been before she was ruined ' .1 Brunelleschi 's love for beautiful old things was so intense that on one occasion , when he was told by Dona-tello of an antique marble vase at Cortona , he rushed off there from Florence just as he was , in his mantle , his hood , and his wooden shoes , without saying where he was going , and went on foot to Cortona ' some 72 miles for that purpose ' .2 A similar story is related of Falconetto , who frequently visited Rome ; the journey thither was consequently so familiar to him that he would undertake it on any occasion , however slight , while his youth and vigour remained to him . On this subject people still living relate that , being one day in dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Verona , respecting the propor-tions of some ancient cornice , I know not what , in Rome , Giovan-Maria , after many words had passed , remarked , " On this point I will soon make myself certain " , and departing at once to his house , he set out without more ado to Rome ' nearly 300 miles away.3 Evidently there were connoisseurs and virtuosi among architects in those days . Vasari was certainly one of them , and he collected drawings and antiques with the same discrimination that inspired Sir John Soane ( see p. 331 ) a century ago . Michelangelo 's success dated from the occasion when he palmed off a spurious antique ' bronze . of his own manufacture on an unsuspecting cardinal . In Brunelleschi 's day , as we have seen , the hunt for antiques had barely begun , but it developed into a craze , and in the sixteenth century Primaticcio , then working in France , was dispatched by the king to Rome to buy and copy 1 46 T 4e Architect in History antiques ? One edition after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits of Florence ridiculed Baccio d'Agnolo 's architecture in sonnets , he remained unruffled because he knew that he had imitated good examples . ' 2 Most significant of all , perhaps , is Vasari 's reference to a house with the appearance and form of a Ruin ' , designed by Girolamo Genga ( 1476 ? 1551 ) to the order of the Duke of Urbino , of which the biographer observes that This also is an object very pleasant to see ' .3 When one reads of this overwhelming passion for the antique , one can not help speculating on the attitude of Italian architects of the Renaissance to the buildings of the Middle Ages scattered over the length and breadth of Italy . Vasari himself was a critic of catholic taste , and though his preference , as we have seen , was all for ancient architecture , he chronicles the lives and describes the work of medieval masters without undue bias . There are a few references in his pages to works of restoration . Thus , when the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence , designed by Arnolfo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored for structural reasons and modernized to meet changed requirements in 1538 , the Duke resolved to carry out the necessary alterations without destroying the old works , in which there was certainly something good ' .4 On the other hand , according to Lanciani , 5 the architects of the Renaissance were guilty of shocking van-dalism in Rome . This system of wholesale plundering , of promiscuous usage of Pagan and Christian materials , of ruining many edifices for the benefit of one , inaugurated by Constantine , was // followed by his immediate successors , and even more mercilessly by the architects of the Renaissance , such as Fra Giocondo of Verona , the two Sangalli , the two Peruzzi , Raphael , Michelangelo , to whom the care of rebuilding St. Peter 's was entrusted . ' . . . They had no more compunction about burning into lime antique statues and portrait-busts and historical inscriptions than of levelling to the ground temples , baths , porticos , triumphal arches , &c.,; provided such misdeeds made easier and cheaper their task . ' The masons of Julius II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value : one piece was lost , a second used in paving the nave , a third in the altar . One of Giotto 's frescoes was only saved because Pierino del Vaga happened to pass just as its destruction was imminent . The architects of the fabbrica of St. Peter 's were authorized by a papal brief of 1540 to excavate in the Forum and the Via Sacra for antiques and other materials ' . Terrible damage was done in this way during that fatal decade , 1540 ? 49 86 cartloads of travertine were taken from one building in the Forum . In 1546 Paul III , the Pope who gave the authority just mentioned , instructed his confidential manager to transfer this priceless plunder to his own house , not to St. Peter 's . Thus we see another side of the picture . But not all famous architects of this period limited their activities to architecture . We are constantly impressed by their versatility . Leonardo da Vinci is sometimes regarded as the Admirable Crichton of the Italian Renaissance . He was painter , poet , sculptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explorer . He also studied botany and anatomy , was an admirable performer on the lyre , and the first scientific writer on his L2 // special art of painting ' .1 Yet his surviving work is not to be compared with that of Michelangelo or Peruzzi , and as an architect he did little . Most of the great artists of the Renaissance were many-sided men , with the intense intellectual curiosity and love of learning for its own sake that distinguished their period and country . Many of them dabbled in music and poetry , several of them wrote books ( though not so freely as in the next period ) , and most of them combined the artistic and the practical to an extent noteworthy for us to-day . There was no hard line between science ' and art ' : mathematics , mechanics , and geometry were an essential part of the architect 's equipment , and even in his re-searches into antiquity he was as much concerned with the composition of Roman stucco and the bonding of Roman masonry as with the proportions of cornices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one craft to another , and his ability to do so can only be explained by inexplicable genius . Occasionally one finds an ambitious man with a fixed object in mind : thus the versatile Brunelleschi is said to have decided quite early in life to revive Roman architecture and to complete the unfinished Duomo at Florence . Rapidly running through painting , mechanics , goldsmith 's work , gem-setting , architecture , carving , classical studies , inlaying , geometry , the Scriptures , and Dante , he attained both his objects at the last . Even more startling is the career of Fra Giocondo , a learned friar who , in the course of a long life , almost boxed the intellectual compass . Having excelled in philosophy , theology , and Greek , he made a model for a bridge while still acting as a pedagogue , became proficient in perThe // spective , studied the Roman ruins and wrote a book on them , edited Caesar and Vitruvius , edited Pliny 's letters , built two bridges at Paris , carried out other architectural work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's , designed a whole system of drainage for the Venetian lagoons , and finally evolved a town-planning scheme for the Rialto district of Venice . Knowing that he also practised agriculture and gardening , one can only gasp at this catalogue , and then accept Vasari 's apt statement that he was a man of universal attainment ' .1 Sometimes we find music mentioned among the many accomplishments of these versatile architects ; others are praised for their conversational powers . Others again had scientific tastes , thus Pelori , a good and able archi-tect ' when he liked , frittered away his time in fanciful designs , in measuring old buildings , and in inventions of various kinds . He gave much attention to mathematics and cosmography , constructing quadrants , the mariner 's compass , instruments for measuring , and other things of similar kind , with his own hand . ' 2 Rustici wasted his time in freezing mercury , keeping hedgehogs , and flirting with the occult . For this prevailing versatility had its drawbacks . A man who was able to practise several arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as far as his ability could have taken him . Vasari points out that Tribolo , whose explosive personality we have already noted in this chapter , abandoned sculpture , in which it may be truly said that he was an artist of high excellence , and surprised all who beheld his works , for the vain attempt to restrict the course of rivers , in which he met with no success , ' 3 this being a reference to his ill-starred career as Commissioner of Roads and Rivers to // the State of Florence . On the other hand , it was Michel-angelo 's perfect confidence in his own abilities that took him into architecture as an old man . When he started painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel he designed all his own scaffolding , because that which Bramante had erected was unsuitable , and had no hesitation in telling the Pope that Bramante did not know how to construct it ' .1 At that time , we must remember , Bramante was architect of St. Peter 's , and Michelangelo only a famous painter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope to prepare a model for the facade of S. Lorenzo at Florence , the leading architects of the day , several of whom had submitted designs for this work , objected to the appointment of an amateur ' . But he determined to prepare the model himself , and not to accept any guide , or permit any superior in the matter of the architecture ' .2 Yet even in that marvellous age men were capable of astonishment , and when Brunelleschi , acknowledged al-ready as a master of many crafts , showed his first carved crucifix to his friend Donatello , the latter was so surprised that he dropped out of his apron on to the floor the eggs and other comestibles that he had brought for their frugal meal.3 About 1423 we come across the mention of a woman-architect , probably an amateur , of the Gaddi family who ventured to place her knowledge in competition with that of Filippo ' Brunelleschi .4 The range of the architect 's duties during the early and middle Renaissance in Italy was astoundingly wide , but little is said about town-planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not then much // in fashion . It was in the Baroque period that it suddenly blossomed out on the grand scale . As early as 1355 it is recorded that Orcagna won a competition for the lay-out of the Piazza della Signoria in Florence ; 1 Poggio Im-periale was laid out by Giuliano da Sangallo ( 144.3-1517 ) at a much later date , but apparently with a view to de-fence ; 2 and Fra Giocondo 's lay-out of part of Venice has just been mentioned . These instances are , however , comparatively infrequent in Vasari 's pages , and we may conclude that , though architects undertook what little town-planning was required , the idea of an ordered dis-position of streets and squares to produce a monumental effect had hardly emerged . But the position as regards works of engineering , especially military engineering , is very different . In those days the functions of the engineer , military or civil , had not been detached from those of the architect , and the art of fortification formed an important part of his duties . It is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day and painting Madonnas or carving crucifixes on the morrow . Brunelleschi , Michelozzi , Bramante , the Sangalli , Peruzzi , the Genghe , Michelangelo , and , especially , Sanmicheli , all carried out such work . Yet of those who figure in Vasari 's pages in this connexion , only one , Cecca , is described as an engineer ' , though he began life as a joiner . Giuliano da Sangallo was still occupied with his studies in design , and the blood of youth was still dancing in his veins ' when an hostile army appeared in Florentine territory ; whereupon Lorenzo de'Medici saw himself compelled to despatch an engineer to Castellana for the purpose of constructing bastions and defences of // various kinds , and who should also take charge of the artillery , to the management of which few men were at that time com-petent . He therefore sent Giuliano , whom he considered to be a man of intelligence , promptitude , and resolution . ' .. . Arrived at Castellana , therefore , Giuliano fortified the place within and without , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defences necessary to the security of the town . he remarked that the artillerymen handled their guns very timidly , standing at a distance from them while loading or raising them , and firing them with evident fear ; he set himself therefore to remedy this evil , and so contrived that no further accidents happened to the artillerymen , although several of them had previously been killed by the recoil . ' .. . Giuliano 's successful solution of this and other military problems resulted in the abandonment of the siege , gained for him no small praise in Florence , and obtained him the goodwill of Lorenzo , who received him most favourably and loaded him with commendations ' .1 At this point Vasari remarks that Giuliano , hitherto a joiner or wood-carver with a taste for drawing , afterwards turned his attention to architecture ' . Thus we find an untrained civilian put in charge of artillery and defences , yet succeeding so well that the ducal interest afterwards enabled him to enter a profession from which circum-stances had previously barred him . The military adventures of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was planning the siege of Florence in 1529 , he commissioned Tribolo ( a native of Florence , born in 1500 ) and another man to collaborate in making a relief-model of the city and its neighbourhood , showing thereon not only the surrounding hills , moun-tains , rivers , and churches , but also the squares and // streets within the town , together with the walls , bastions , and other defences ' . This model , which the treacherous Tribolo had actually suggested to the Pope , involved for its makers much dangerous spying by night , ' measuring the roads , and ascertaining the exact number of braccia between one place and another , with the heights and levels of the summits of all the churches and towers ' .1 For the sake of lightness the model was made of cork ; its size was four braccia ( about 7 feet 6 inches ) , it was made to scale , and it could be taken to pieces . When finished , it was packed up and conveyed secretly out of Florence ' ? ( this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he could direct the siege from a distance , just as a modern general directs his campaign at a distance with the aid of a large-scale ordnance map . At all events , the whole incident is thoroughly discreditable to a pro-fessional architect . Peruzzi was also invited to assist the Pope in the pre-parations for this siege . According to Vasari he actually went to the camp outside Florence , and then patriotically declined to have anything further to do with it ; but a letter of Peruzzi 's , since discovered and published , shows that he actually did take part in the operations against the city.2 Michelangelo was working on the famous Medici Chapel in Florence when the city was besieged in 1529 , and lent the authorities the sum of 1,000 crowns towards the cost of the defence . He was in charge of the forti-fications , and as he made one of the Council of War , called the Nine , he turned all his mind and thoughts to the perfecting and strengthening of the defences . But at length , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while all hope of aid was gradually disappearing , ' ? as he felt himself to be in a position not suited to him ' , he resolved for the safety of his person , to leave Florence and repair to Venice ' . He departed secretly with two friends , and worked at Venice for some time , but later was prevailed on to return to his native city and , moved by love of his native place , he did eventually return , but not without danger to his life ' , and rendered valuable help in the later stages of the siege . ' But it was Sanmicheli above all others whose achieve-ments in military architecture have enhanced his reputa-tion . Vasari rightly compares his frowning gateways at Verona and elsewhere with the work of the Romans , 2 and he does seem to have inherited the genius of his great ancestors for expressing in stone the power of the armed State . He was mainly employed by Venice , and designed fortifications for the Venetian possessions in the Adriatic and Mediterranean as well as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us nowadays as a gay bathing-beach , he erected a fortress on piles , the site being marshy in itself and exposed to the full force of the sea . Vasari describes the elaborate precautions taken by the architect to ensure a stable foundation , and then proceeds to relate how its strength was tested . The Signori ordered an immense quantity of artillery , and that of the very heaviest to be found in the Arsenal , to be brought to the fortress , and having caused all the embrasures above as well as below , to be filled with cannon , even more heavily loaded than common , they had all fired off together . Then the uproar , the thunders , and the earthquake that were heard and felt were such and so vast , as to make it appear as if the // whole world were falling to pieces , while the mass of the building itself , with all its mouths of fire , presented the aspect of a great volcano , or rather of a very hell . But the fabric remained firm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidity , to the utter shame of the malignant critics , who were proved to be utterly destitute of judgment . ' ... " The envious detractors had nevertheless caused so much terror in Venice , that many gentlewomen who were pregnant at the time were removed from the city in the fear of some frightful catastrophe . ' 1 Architects also practised civil ' engineering , thus Michelozzi constructed an aqueduct and a road at Assisi , Camicia built ' mills ' for the King of Hungary , Baccio Pintelli designed the Ponte Sisto at Rome , Antonio da Sangallo arranged the water-supply at Orvieto and Terni , and Fra Giocondo , as already noted ( see p. 149 ) , acted as bridge-builder and town-planner among his many occupations . In regard to what we now call garden architecture ' , mention must be made once more of the name of Tribolo , whose antics have earned for him undue prominence in this chapter . The formal lay-out of gardens was a novelty up to the sixteenth century , and when Tribolo began work at Castello he was mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for water-supply were in the hands of an engineer or builder who had neither invention nor knowledge of design ' . However , shortly after the engineer had brought the water up to the fountains , he suddenly died , whereupon Tribolo undertook the remainder of the engineering work involved , including the diversion of a stream and the construction of an aqueduct ? Garden architecture in the sixteenth // century , in Italy as elsewhere , included the construction of elaborate waterworks ' destined to surprise and drench the guests , usually from the floor , as a merry quip on the part of their host . The passion for symbolism and display that marked Italian society in this brilliant period led to the addition of another kind of design for the architect . He was con-stantly employed in the invention of masques , triumphal arches , and all the gorgeous trappings of festivals arranged to commemorate a victory , a deliverance , or the visit of a royal personage . Such work required a vivid imagina-tion and great mechanical ingenuity as well as high artistic ability . Vasari devotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasteboard architecture , and there is one intensely amusing story in the life of Tribolo the troublesome , relating how the Girandola , a great set-piece of fireworks intended to burn for a full hour , suddenly flared up when it was lighted , thus diminishing the reputation of poor Tribolo , who had insisted that such things should be designed by an architect and not by simpletons ' .1 It is interesting to note that when Antonio da Sangallo designed a triumphal arch , he directed the sculptors and painters who were concerned in its decoration.2 Brunelleschi , too , did work of this sort , and Peruzzi sometimes worked as a scene-painter . The status of the architect in this period depended solely on his ability . His social position in Italy could be what he made it , and there was no limit to the heights he might attain . Architects held high positions as magistrates and councillors ; they were held in honour by Popes , cardinals , and the great princes of the Medici house . Raphael , we are told , lived the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1 on the other hand , Antonio Sangallo was afflicted with a wife ( married in haste against the wishes of his family ) who ' lived rather in the manner of a most splendid lady than of an architect 's wife ' , and made extravagant demands upon his otherwise ample income ? The privileged position occupied by famous practi-tioners may be inferred from the way in which they some-times spoke to their noble patrons . Thus , when Giuliano da Sangallo requested to be dismissed from his post at St. Peter 's because of the Pope 's lack of interest in the progress of the building , Julius replied with some heat that Sangallo was not the only architect on earth . Whereupon Giuliano made answer that for truth and faithful service never would he find an equal to himself , whereas it would be easy for him to find princes who would maintain their promises with more fidelity than the Pope had shown towards him . ' 3 Rustici , an architect of independent means , told the Syndics of the Merchant 's Guild at Florence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most truculent of them all , frequently lost his temper with the Pope , and on one of these occasions threw a plank at his Holiness ' head from the top of a scaffold.5 Michelangelo insisted on having a clause inserted in his contracts that he should not be interfered with . Once , when the assembled cardinals , constituting what we should call the Building Committee ' of St. Peter 's , objected that insufficient lighting had been provided , Michelangelo replied : ? I neither am nor will be obliged to tell your lordship or any other person what I intend or ought to do for this work ; // your office is to procure money , and to take care that thieves do not get the same ; the designs for the building you are to leave to my care . ' 1 Nor must one forget the case of Verrocchio , who stipulated that , wherever he was working , but more particularly for monks or friars .... the door of the cellar , or whatever place the wine was kept in , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever he pleased , without asking leave from anyone . ' z An architect obtained his work then , as nowadays , either by personal interest or in competition . Personal interest was largely confined to the Pope and his cardinals , and to princely patrons like the Medici . One often reads of architects living in close touch with such celebrities and even following them into exile when their stars waned . Luigi Cornaro conceived so great a liking ' for the architect Falconetto that he caused him to dwell in his own house , where he entertained him honourably for the space of twenty years ' that is , for the remainder of Falconetto 's life , and , during that period , feeling a desire to behold and to examine those antiquities of Rome which he had seen in the drawings of the artist , took the latter with him to that city , where , having Falconetto constantly in his company , he took care to examine every building minutely 1 .3 Bartolommeo Genga , like his father , was permanently attached to the service of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his death.4 Other architects , as we have seen , relied on the patronage of the famous family of Medici . Alberti utilized the good offices of a friend who was secretary to the Pope .5 Cronaca was // successful in a competition for a church chiefly because he was a friend of the great Savonarola . ' Competitions seem to have been arranged usually by invitation , and were often resorted to not only for large buildings , and schemes , but even for parts of buildings , such as the dome and the bronze doors at Florence , and the cornice of the Farnese palace at Rome . As nowadays , competitions often gave rise to bickering and bad feeling among the architects concerned . The story of Brunelleschi 's adventures in the great competition for the dome at Florence forms one of the most interesting passages in Vasari 's Lives 2 but is unfortunately too lengthy for quotation here . The practice of architecture in Italy at that period was beset with the same difficulties and worries that often mar it to-day , so that a sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intensely personal nature of the architect 's work that had so largely replaced the semi-communal organization of the Middle Ages led to rivalries and jealousies , usually caused by the struggle for fame and consequent remunera-tion . So , though Vasari pictures an age where art was genuinely worshipped for its own sake , he mentions a host of petty squabbles , some of them among really great men , like Michelangelo . Most of these architects had to rely entirely on their earnings for their livelihood . Occasionally we came across the mention of architects of independent means , such as Rustici ( see p. 134 ) , and Franceso di Giorgio , a man of fair possessions ' , who were therefore more or less their own masters . Falconetto who had a great and most exalted mind ' , coupled with the patronage of Messer Luigi Cornaro , had so soaked 16o The Architect in History that mind with the achievements in architecture of the Romans that he preferred to spend his time in drawing fanciful designs for grandiose schemes and would not deign to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although very frequently urged to do so ' . i But his case was exceptional , and for most architects the scramble for a livelihood was inevitable . Professional rivalry inevitably resulted , and occasionally professional men discovered and duly pulverized an amateur in their preserve , ' though , as we have seen , the door leading into architectural practice was generally ajar . Sometimes the architect was dilatory , sometimes over-hasty . Thus Bramante 's hustling of the foundations of the Belvedere at the Vatican , to please an exacting master , afterwards led to a failure and Raphael also is typical of the architect who is too ready to meet unreasonable requests , in fact , at the Vatican he was so courteous and obliging , that for the convenience of certain among his friends , he commanded the masons not to build the walls in a firm uninterrupted range , but to leave certain spaces among the old chambers on the lower floors , to the end that they might store casks , pipes , firewood , &c.,; therein , ' and again the result was disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Peter 's may be compared with those that darkened Wren 's latter days at our own St. Paul 's ; and Jacopo Sansovino was once thrown into prison , fined , and degraded at the instance of detractors , but afterwards released and reinstated in favour when it was discovered that the collapse of a vault which had led to this accusation was in no way his respons-bility . But of all the pictures that Vasari gives us of an architect 's cares , there is none more vivid than that of // Brunelleschi working on the dome at Florence , dealing with labour troubles , locking out strikers , organizing canteens in the dome to save time lost by workmen descending for dinner at midday , inventing and improv-ing scaffolding and tackle.l Yet Brunelleschi , though hampered by all these sordid details and capable of dealing with every one of them , was one of the foremost artists that Italy has ever produced . An architect in general practice sometimes undertook consulting ' work , either in his own State , or in other parts of Italy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad ? e. g . Michelozzi designed a hospital at Jerusalem for the Medici ; 2 Andrea Sansovino worked for the King of Portugal for nine years ; 3 Sanmicheli designed fortresses in Dalmatia , Corfu , Cyprus , and Crete ; 4 Primaticcio settled in France , 5 and Fra Giocondo worked there ; 6 and Bartolommeo Genga designed fortifications , a town-plan , and many palaces and churches in Malta , for the Knights of St. John.7 Though the professional status of the architect was not quite so clearly defined as it is to-day , there seems no reason for concluding that he often undertook the work of the builder too . Even so early , as 1423 , we find that Brunelleschi succeeded in paralysing all the work on the cathedral at Florence by shamming illness and remaining in bed . The master-builders ' and the purveyor of the works ' came to see him there , unable to proceed without him , and thus making it clear , as Brunelleschi intended , that he and he alone possessed the master-brain on that great undertaking. $ On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and masons ( scarpellini ) to Loreto ? Sometimes the architect was not above a commercial speculation , thus Aristotile Sangallo ran a cement-factory for his architect-brother ' It is very difficult to salaries . Brunelleschi , after finally getting rid of his rival Ghiberti on the cathedral at Florence , received loo florins down and a permanent appointment in charge of the building with a salary of ioo florins . ' It is clear that while some artists declined ill-paid work , others were content to put their art before money . They even declined tempting offers to change their employment or their place of abode . But on the whole the capable artists lived well , in so appreciative an age , and the great masters became rich men . When Michelangelo declined to accept any fees for his work at St. Peter 's , he was already old and wealthy . Perquisites , allowances , and ecclesiastical or state offices sometimes enhanced a salary or fees . Thus Jacopo Sansovino , as architect to the Venetian state , had a house as well as a salary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King of Naples when he left that monarch 's service , but suggested that a few antiques ' would be acceptable instead ; nor did he reject the horses and clothing included in the original offer . Architects employed by the Popes often held some office connected with the papal court , and Raphael was intended for , and would have received , a cardinal 's hat , but meanwhile did not abandon the light attachment by which he wag enchained , and one day on returning to his ' house from // one of these secret visits , he was seized with a violent fever ' , and so died hatless.1 The architect 's assistant appears now and then in Vasari 's pages , marrying his master 's daughter , ' acting as ghost ' to an incompetent chief , ' and sometimes obtaining generous recognition , as when young Cronaca designed the magnificent cornice of the Strozzi Palace for Brunelleschi after a sketch that he had made in student days in Rome.4 One of Bramante 's assistants was a carpenter , perhaps employed by him to make models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who themselves became famous in later years . A heredi-tary practice , passing from father to son or nephew , was no rare thing , and the architectural families ' of Sangallo , Genga , Peruzzi , Falconetto , d'Agnolo , Sanmicheli , and Sansovino may be mentioned . The large number of drawings preserved from this period enables us to judge of the architect 's ability and methods of draughtsmanship without much difficulty . For the purpose of brief criticism here they may be classified under four general heads : studies from the antique , free sketches , working drawings , and imaginary designs . Figs. 22 , 24 , 25 , 28 , illustrate examples of each type , all taken from the wonderful collection in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence . Fig. 25 is a reproduction of one of a series of measured drawings of antique fragments made by Antonio da Sangallo the Elder ( 1455 ? 1534 ) and repre-sents an entablature found in the Piazza Navona in Rome . There are other decorated cornices in the same series and a beautiful study of an Ionic capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting that M2 1.64 The Architect in History we possess from this period ; but there are others of outstanding merit , by unknown artists , in the Sketch-book of Andreas Coner ' at the Soane Museum . Draw-ings of whole buildings , such as the Colosseum , have also survived . If it were possible to illustrate here a number of examples , ' it would become evident that Italian masters of the Early and Middle Renaissance were skilled in perspective . This appears notably in some of Bramante 's drawings ; as also in Fig. 22 , from a remarkable sketch in the Uffizi Gallery , by an unknown master of the sixteenth century , representing the scaffolding for the lantern of the Duomo at Florence ( cf. Fig. 27 ) ; and in another study partly in plan and partly in elevational perspective , by Bramante according to Geymiiller or by Peruzzi according to later critics , for the completion of St. Peter 's at Rome . Fig. 24 is from Peruzzi 's working drawing for the Palazzo Massimi in Rome . In the same collection is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building ; also a plan and details of the church of S. Domenico at Siena . Both plans are drawn to scale , dimensioned , and annotated . There is a large-scale detail elevation of the interior of the church of S. Lorenzo at Florence , by Brunelleschi , probably the earliest Renaissance drawing extant . Fig. 28 is a conjectural restoration for the great hall of the Baths of Diocletian by Giuliano da Sangallo ( d. 1516 ) , and is given here as an example of imaginative design , though there are many other drawings which , perhaps , better deserve that title . But it was in the last period of the Renaissance that architects gave free rein to their fancy , and produced whole albums of masterly designs for buildings which they never could expect to carry out . // It has sometimes been assumed that models were used as a substitute for drawings , but there are many references in Vasari making it quite clear that this was not generally so . For example , the picture reproduced in Fig. 23 clearly shows the architect presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside him ready for subsequent action . A model gives to a layman the clearest idea of a building in three dimensions , and though we know that Brunelleschi was regarded as an expert in perspective , on this occasion he is evidently relying on a model and a utilitarian plan rather than on a skilful perspective drawing . Fig. 26 illustrates the model of the lantern for the Duomo at Florence , made by Brunelleschi to enable it to be finished according to his ideas after his death , and now preserved in the Museo dell ' Opera del Duomo . It is of worm-eaten wood , and is made , as nearly as I can calculate , to a scale of 3 feet to r inch , measuring about 21 inches from the base of the lantern to the underside of the ball . A small portion of the dome is shown stripped of its covering , thus enabling the ribs and staircases to be seen . The same museum contains two wooden models of the dome , said to be even earlier . Bramante is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as an excellent draughtsman . On one occasion Michelangelo 's assistant made five alternative sketch designs for a church , and then a clay model of the design selected by his clients . This model was of eight palms ' in length and took the assistant ten days to make .2 Michelangelo himself made a model in a fortnight for the completion of St. Peter 's , at a cost of 25 crowns . Vasari contrasts it with the model made for the same purpose by Antonio da Sangallo , which cost 4,000 crowns 1 66 The Architect in History and took several years to make.l Sangallo 's model was 37 palms in length and the actual building was intended to have a length of 1,040 palms . Hence the scale of the model was approximately 1 : z8 , or rather less than z inch to i foot . Both models are preserved at St. Peter 's . For his models of the dome at Florence , elaborately made to scale in wood with all internal and external details , Brunelleschi was paid in 1423 only some 50 lire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lire for his rejected model , a difference ascribed by Vasari to sheer favouritism 2 It appears that important permanent models , serving as a guide to the builders , were made of wood , and that those used to give a client a general idea of the effect of a building were modelled in clay . Mention has already been made ( p. 153 ) of Tribolo 's cork model of Florence , constructed in sections to facilitate transport . There are other instances of relief models of towns 3 and of fortifications : thus the Venetian state kept a model of the fortifications of Venice which was periodically brought up to date .4 Fra Giocondo made a model for a bridge at Verona.5 and Bartolommeo Genga completed a church from a model left by his father.6 Michelangelo 's full-size com-petition model of the cornice for the Farnese Palace at Rome was fixed on the building to give an idea of the ultimate effect . ' Though architects before the days of Palladio and Vignola were not prolific authors , they produced a number of books , mainly concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cesariano , had written a com-mentary on Vitruvius , but falling into despair at finding // himself disappointed in the remuneration he had expected to receive for that work ' , eventually lost his reason.l Alberti and Fra Giocondo were the chief writers in this field , Francesco di Giorgio published a book on engineer-ing , Andrea Sansovino wrote on distances and measure-ments ' and another treatise on floor-construction , and Peruzzi commenced a work on the antiquities of Rome , afterwards incorporated in Serlio 's volumes . The admirable biographies contained in Vasari 's Lives are not the nly records we possess of Renaissance architects in Italy . Contemporary portraits have been preserved of most of them , their chief buildings still stand , and their tombs are to be found in St. Peter 's , the Pantheon , and the churches that they designed . For it was a great age for an architect to live in ; he was appreciated and honoured . Yet the temperament of the artist often abhorred publicity , and it is perhaps necessary to correct misappre-hension on this point by quoting in conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art ' , he writes , demands the whole man , with all his thoughts , for herself . He who resigns his life to her may well disregard society , seeing that he is never alone nor without food for contemplation ; and whoever shall attribute this love of solitude to caprice or eccentricity does wrong . The man who would produce works of merit should be free from cares and anxieties , seeing that Art demands earnest consideration , loneliness , and quietude ; she can not permit wandering of the mind . ' 2 For the later and Baroque ' periods of the Renaissance our information is largely derived from Milizia , a scholar // whose work on the lives of famous architects first appeared in 1768.1 Though not himself an architect , he is a keen and unsparing critic , much more so than Vasari . He seldom condescends to give us the amusing and trivial incidents of life as Vasari does ; nevertheless on one occasion he tells us that an architect , who was old enough to know better , died of eating too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is enabled to make comparisons between conditions obtaining in the period 1550 ? 1750 and those already described . As one might expect , in that essentially aristocratic age , architects usually came from the upper and professional classes ; thus , of some 30 typical examples , only four appear to have been the sons of artisans , whereas nine were architects ' sons , three the sons of painters and sculptors , and the remainder well-born ' . More than a third of them were Lombards , the proportion of Floren-tines and Tuscans being much less than in earlier days , and the number of Romans being small ; one architect , Vanvitelli ( Van Witel ) , came to Italy from Holland . Many entered the profession from other walks of life ; thus , out of 5o or 6o lives examined , seven men entered architecture from other branches of art , three from the study of letters , one or two from the law , one was a builder , another a mason , another an engineer in the army , and three came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them , assumed the ecclesiastical habit solely with a view to studying architecture ) . Father Pozzo , the author of the maddest architectural designs that ever // appeared in print , began as a Jesuit cook , then successively practised painting , perspective , and architecture . ) Curi-ously enough , the other chief extremist of the Baroque period , Filippo Guarini , was a Theatine monk . Up to the middle of the seventeenth century , training continued to be chiefly by means of pupilage or apprentice-ship , supplemented by exhaustive measuring and sketch-ing of Roman antiquities . Subjects of study , besides drawing , included especially mathematics , geometry , perspective , and mechanics , but literary subjects are frequently mentioned . Architectural studies were some-times commenced at iz years of age . Milizia relates that one Teodoli , a marquis by birth and an architect by profession , being desirous of taking pupils , selected young men of the best capacity , whom he instructed with the greatest possible kindness . ' . . . His theory was good , and his manner of teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted , showing how the chief architects of this period acquired their training . Alessi studied drawing and architecture under Caporali , an architect who had edited Vitruvius , then spent six years among the Roman ruins , and commenced practice at the age of thirty . Vignola first studied painting and perspec-tive , then turned to architecture , and worked on the Roman antiquities until he was thirty . Palladio com-menced architectural studies at the outset , and made three visits to Rome to sketch and measure , but also gave some attention to literature . Tibaldi , a mason 's son , began as a painter , went to Rome to study architecture at twenty , and seems to have commenced practice about three years later . Domenico Fontana , having acquired the rudi-ments of geometry ' , went to Rome at the age of twenty // to join his brother who was studying architecture there . Vicenzo Scamozzi was trained by his father , an architect , also studied mathematics , and proceeded to Rome to study the antiquities at twenty-five . Giacomo della Porta and Carlo Maderno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in architecture by Vignola , the latter by his uncle . Aleotti was at first a builder , then studied architecture and geometry , and became an architect . Rainaldi commenced his education with geometry and literature , then passed into architecture . Bernini , like his prototype Michelangelo , entered architecture from sculpture ; his great rival Borromini spent a short time in the same work , but then was sent to Rome to his uncle Carlo Maderno who taught him architecture and geometry . In the last stage of the Renaissance , the influence of the architectural academies was strongly felt in Italy . The earliest of these , the Accademia di S. Luca in Rome , was reorganized in 1577 as a centre of artistic culture and a means of intercourse between artistic and learned men . It had its own statutes , privileges , professors , and lecturers ; and was intended to further the education of painters , sculptors , and architects . The close connexion between these three arts remained unbroken , in spite of the development of architectural scholarship , and Father Pozzo ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who has mastered painting and perspective will be a good architect . ' Certainly Bernini 's powers as a sculptor , like Michelangelo 's before him , appear to advantage in his designs and his drawings . The architect now had to supplement his training in a master 's studio with attendance at lectures in the Academy at Rome .. Among those who studied there were Pietro da Cortona , Algardi , Carlo Fontana , Maderno , Bernini , Borromini , and Vanvitelli . Rome thus became more than ever the Mecca of the ambitious architectural student from other parts of Italy . Other academies were established in Bologna ( the Accademia Clementina ) , Venice , Naples ( the Accademia di S. Carlo , founded in 1755 ) , Turin ( the Compagnia di S. Luca , founded in 1652 and later merged in the University ) , and Milan ( 1776 ) ; as well as smaller academies in Lucca , Modena , Parma , and Ferrara .. Among the architectural staff of the academy at Bologna was Francesco Bibiena , of the famous family of theatrical architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying . A chair of civil architecture was established at Padua in the eighteenth century . In connexion with the Accademia di S. Luca at Rome , an architectural scholarship or prize was established in 1702 , to be followed by similar foundations of less importance . It is extraordinary that all this movement towards the standardization of architectural training , inevitably placing a heavy emphasis upon the Rules of the Ancients , should so nearly have synchronized with the cheerful unconven-tionality of the Baroque masters , to whom all rules are supposed to have been equally abhorrent . Probably the explanation is that , at first , close contact with painters and sculptors tended to make the architect strive for the bold and picturesque rather than the correct ; and that when the professors really got a strangle-hold on design in the eighteenth century they killed it so successfully that their work has been forgotten . Milizia relates one pleasinanecdote about an archi172 The Architect in History tect 's assistant . Domenico Fontana , being occupied with other work , entrusted the design of a church to his pupil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who admired it . Fontana gave the full credit for it to Rainaldi , whose fortune was thereafter assured.l The status of the architect was now clearly defined , and though he sometimes dabbled in painting and sculp-ture , he generally confined himself to one art . No longer is there any chance of confusing him with the builder , for the two occupations are differentiated , as when we are told that Silvani , the architect , aged ninety-six , ascended the winding stair of a campanile in company with the builder , aged ioo.2 Yet one architect came to grief over his alleged maladministration of clerical building funds.3 The design of fortifications , theatrical properties and scenery , gardens and bridges , formed a part of the archi-tect 's normal duties , and he continued to be a versatile man . One may safely award the palm for many-sidedness to Guidotti of Lucca , who practised architecture , painting , sculpture , and body-snatching ; studied mathematics , astrology , law , music , and poetry ; and finally broke his thigh in a flying accident , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own design at a public display .4 But one can detect a certain change in the nature of the work done by architects at this period . Military engineer-ing is less often mentioned than in Vasari 's Lives ; whereas civil engineering , as we understand it , continues to form a part of general practice . Thus Ammanati , Buontalenti , Domenico Fontana , Silvani , and Girolamo Rainaldi all designed bridges some of great beauty ; Domenico Fontana constructed the great aqueduct , 22 miles long , // known as the Acqua Felice , at Rome ; also a canal ; and was assisted in all this work by his elder brother Giovanni who specialized in hydraulic engineering . The characteristics of the Baroque period in Italy were splendour , freedom , ostentation , and the introduction of planning on the grand scale with the admitted aim of producing a monumental effect . Bernini 's wonderful Piazza di S. Pietro , the Spanish Steps ' , and the Scala Regia at the Vatican are all cases in point ; while the villas of Genoa , Tuscany , Frascati , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture in country surroundings . Hence one finds town-planning , formal garden design , and theatrical architecture assuming an increased importance in the architect 's repertoire . It was an artificial and an aristocratic age , less spontaneous and more stilted than the previous period . The ideal client ' was now invariably the Pope or one of his cardinals , though the great nobles continued to erect palaces of increasing magnificence . Bernini and Borromini , among other leading architects , both had enormous general practices , and struggled with each other for professional supremacy . It does not seem that many architects specialized in any one type of building : the exceptional case of Giovanni Fontana has been cited , and to this may be added the remarkable monopoly of theatre design enjoyed in their day by the Bibiena family . But general private practice appears to have been the rule , and there are few instances in Milizia of the salaried appointments that were so common in earlier days . It need hardly be said that a successful architect in Rome at this period enjoyed both riches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to his architect Buontalenti that he commonly took him // in his own carriage , not only to evening amusements , but about the city during the day ' After Domenico Fontana had succeeded in erecting the obelisk in the Piazza di San Pietro at Rome the artificers , intoxicated with joy , carried Fontana on their shoulders in triumph to his own house , amidst the sound of drums and trumpets and the plaudits of an immense crowd . ' ... For this undertaking Fontana was created a knight of the Golden Spur , and a Roman nobleman : he had a pension of z , 000 crowns , transferable to his heirs , ten knighthoods , ' and other substantial rewards ; while two medals were struck in his honour , his name was inscribed on the base of the obelisk , and a large book was published describing his achievement in detail . But what is the value of these obelisks ? ' asks Milizia , and after a sententious reference to difficulties surmounted ' he sarcastically adds that from this species of vanity some advantages have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em-ployment of men , fame and riches to the artists It is , however , in the life of that great architect Lorenzo Bernini that the tale of vanity and riches attains its climax . Bernini 's career , as well as his accomplished work , is typical of the gorgeous , artificial Baroque spirit of seven-teenth-century Rome . His biography , first written by his son Domenico , has been undertaken by so many subse-quent writers that the main facts of his triumphal progress are familiar to most students of art , but one or two incidents may be quoted to show the social position that he occupied , at a time when social position was one of the main ends in life . While he was still a young man , his patron Cardinal Barberini became Pope as Urban VIII , and addressed him as follows : It is fortunate for you that // the cardinal Maffeo Barberini is become Pope ; but we are still more so , that the Cavaliere Bernini should live during our pontificate. ' 1 Cardinal Mazarin wrote to him repeatedly , entreating him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of France , promising him 12,000 crowns a year . But the Pope would not consent to it , saying that " Bernini was made for Rome , and Rome for Bernini " . ' a On a subsequent occasion Urban VIII suggested to one of his cardinals that he should pay a visit to Bernini 's own house to see the work that he was doing there . 0 Holy Father , ' replied the cardinal , why such condescension ? You lower the papal dignity . ' Very well then , ' said the Pope , we will go and play with the children in our nephew 's house . ' That will be doing rightly ' , said the master of ceremonies . In fact , ' said the Pope with a smile , you approve of our becoming a child , but condemn our going to admire the greatest of men . ' And on the same day His Holiness went with sixteen cardinals to visit Bernini.3 It was actually at the Pope 's instigation that Bernini was affianced to the daughter of an honest secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married state , not from any aversion to the sex , but from his great love for his profession ' . However , from his wedding onwards , he conducted himself with the steadi-ness and propriety becoming his new character ' .4 But his visit to Paris in 1665 reads like some Eastern romance . Louis XIV himself wrote to Bernini in terms of flattering eulogy , congratulating him on the designs he had just made for the Louvre , and begging him to honour Paris with his presence . At the same time Louis addressed // a letter to the Pope , requesting him to release Bernini for a period ; and eventually the great architect , now sixty-eight years of age , set out on his travels . The preparations for his journey resembled a triumphal march . ' . . . Tuscany and Turin treated him with the utmost splendour ' as he passed through . At Lyons , all the professors of the arts , and persons of the first rank , went out to meet him ; and in every country he went through the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accustomed to compare himself to an elephant , or some lusus naturae . The nunzio went out of Paris with relays of horses to receive him , and he was conducted to the royal palace like one about to dispese happiness to the nation . The whole court and nobility vied with each other in paying him attention , and the king evinced to him every possible mark of friendship and generosity . ' 1 Yet all this splendid reception led to nothing , and Bernini 's colossal design for the Louvre was never carried out . On the whole , we may regard this with equanimity , even with thankfulness . Dr. Christopher Wren , then a young man studying architecture in Paris , made an effort to see Bernini and sketch his designs for a collection of drawings of French buildings that he was making . Bernini 's Design of the Louvre I would have given my skin for ; ' writes Wren to his friend Dr. Bateman , but the old reserved Italian gave me but a few minutes view , it was five little Designs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistoles . I had only Time to copy it in my Fancy and Memory , and shall be able by Discourse and a Crayon to give you a tolerable Account of it.2 During the eight months that he was in France , he had five louis d'or a day ; and finally a present of 50,000 crowns , with an annual pension of 2,000 // crowns , and one of 500 for his son , whom he took with him . Such magnificent rewards do honour to the fine arts , but this shows more ostentation than reason , because it was not extended in the same degree to those who were natives of France . ' 1 Yet Bernini , unquestionably the greatest architect of his age in Italy , and perhaps an even greater sculptor , was no sycophant . He was accustomed to visits from crowned heads and clerical notables while he was at work , but he never moved from politeness toany one ; and whoever went to him , lords of the first quality and cardinals , they always seated themselves in silence and watched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of sculpture , he would relapse into a brown study for hours at a time and had to be watched lest he should fall . On such occasions he would say , Do not touch me , I am in love ' , and this was true . Like his great predecessor Michelangelo , whom he resembles both in technique and temperament , he was a tremendous worker and loved his work . Could we sum up together all his idle moments , ' writes Milizia , setting aside his hours for sleep and refreshment , they would not , in the course of so long a life , amount to a month ' .2 Bernini 's rival , Francesco Borromini , was created a // crowns and a pension . He also received the Cross of St. James and ' , coo pistoles from the King of Spain , for designs made ( but never carried out ) for a royal palace .3 Alessandro Algardi was created a Cavaliere di Cristo by Innocent X , who also presented him with a collar of gold worth 300 crowns ' .4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate at which architects were paid for their work at this period , but there seems to be no doubt that successful members of the profession became wealthy men . For nine years ' work on the baldacchino at St. Peter 's Bernini received Io , 000 crowns ; 1 his fees for his visit to Paris have already been mentioned . At his death he left property worth 400,000 crowns ; z a fortune which may be com-pared with 200,000 crowns left ( to a church ) by Pietro da Cortona , 3 8o,000 crowns left by De ' Rossi , 4 and ioo , 000 crowns earned by Pellegrino Tibaldi during nine years ' residence in Spain . ' Whatever may have been the purchas-ing power of the crown in those days , the figures cited above must represent large sums when we find that a well-born and successful architect named Constantino de ' Servi ( 1554 ? 1622 ) was tempted to England to work for the then Prince of Wales for a salary of Boo crowns a year , ' while Filippo Juvara ( 1685 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sicily , with an annual allowance of 600 crowns ' , and also presented with the rich abbey of Selve , worth ' , Too scudi a year ' . ' Any surmises on these financial questions are complicated by uncertainty as to whether an annual salary was paid for an architect 's whole time , or whether it allowed him to accept other work or perquisites . Juvara himself was an abbot while practising architecture and drawing a salary ; another architect became a bishop . ' Buontalenti , whom we re-member as a Baroque designer with good taste and a play-ful fancy , added to a varied architectural practice an appointment as engineer of all Tuscany ' , and in this // capacity designed bridges and fortifications , to say nothing of theatrical scenery and the accessories of public festivals . But , for his invention of a method of preserving ice and snow , the Grand Duke gave him all the duties upon those articles ' .1 It is quite certain that practically all the great architects of the seventeenth century in Italy carried on general practice ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of their multifarious activities . A practice often passed from father to son , or from uncle to nephew , and among Italian architectural families of the late sixteenth , seventeenth , and early eighteenth centuries may be mentioned those of Palladio , Lunghi , Fontana , Rainaldi , De ' Rossi , and Bibiena . The leading architects in Rome and other great Italian cities were often invited abroad , but in spite of substantial bait in the form of salaries they did not always respond . Among those who entered the service of foreign courts may be cited Alessi and Juvara who worked in Portugal ; Tibaldi , who spent nine years in Spain ; Scamozzi , who designed the cathedral at Salzburg ; Constantino de ' Servi , who was employed in Persia , England , Holland , and elsewhere ; Coccopani , who carried out works of military engineering for the emperor at Vienna ; Guarini , who built churches at Paris , Prague , and Lisbon ; Mattia de ' Rossi , who did some work in France ; Galilei , who resided seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibiena , who was summoned first to Barcelona and then to Vienna to arrange the staging of royal festivals . ' Francesco Bibiena ( 1659-1739 ) was invited to London , but unfortunately declined the invitation ; otherwise we might possess in this country an example of his theatre180 The Architect in History craft . ' Vignola is said to have supplied a design for Kelston Manor House , Somerset ( rebuilt in 176o ) , but there is no record that he visited England himself.2 Italian architects often supplied drawings or models for buildings abroad without supervising their erection . Thus Carlo Fontana sent models for a cathedral to Fulda in Germany , and for royal stables to Vienna.3 Besides the ordinary routine of general practice , there are references by Milizia and other writers to consulting work , competitions , and arbitrations . Vignola was invited by the King of Spain to act as assessor in the competition for the Escurial , for which twenty-two architects of various nationalities had submitted designs by invitation . Where-upon Vignola , with that exquisite discernment so peculiar to him , selected whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ideas , produced so beautiful a whole , that Philip II immediately decided on it , and invited Vignola to Spain to execute it ; but his advanced age and attachment to Rome prevented him from undertaking the journey , and the design was not carried into effect . ' 4 Milizia offers no opinion as to Vignola 's professional conduct as an assessor in this case , but then Milizia was not an architect ; at the present day such a proceeding would not be tolerated . On another occasion Vignola was employed to settle a boundary dispute , and did so with judgement and integrity ' . b Considering that the greater part of Rome was rebuilt , and magnificently rebuilt , during this period it is interest-ing to see how the architects concerned treated the monuThe // ments of antiquity which consecrated ( or encumbered ) so much of the ground . In spite of the frantic enthusiasm for the antique that was assumed in the early days of the Renaissance , we have seen ( pp. 146 ? 7 ) that marble columns and priceless sarcophagi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the architects whom they employed . In the Baroque period , when every other architect perpetrated a book on the Orders , very similar conditions prevailed . Sixtus V commissioned Domenico Fontana to convert the ruins of the Colosseum into a wool factory : this noble work was duly put in hand , but was abandoned at the Pope 's death in 1590.1 In , the work of Sixtus V at St. Peter 's , according to Lanciani , we find the same contempt for the memories of the past , and the same prodigious activity and liberality in the substitution of new monuments ... ' He is responsible for the melting of the bronze doors of the old basilica , for the destruction of the invaluable mosaics of the apse of Innocent III , and for the removal of the seven porphyry steps which the pilgrims ad limina were wont to ascend on their knees Bronze doors and beams , bronze ciboria and roof tiles , were stripped ruthlessly from old churches and temples , especially from the Pantheon , which supplied a large part of the 8o tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Peter 's . It is unfair to attribute all the blame for this vandalism to the architects , who were probably only carrying out the orders of clerical em-ployers , but one can not help feeling that they were partly responsible . Nor were all these priceless relics used as // materials to satisfy the megalomania of the papacy . Sarcophagi from St. Peter 's were rifled of their sacred contents and then used as water-troughs ; the bones of medieval popes were thrown on to rubbish heaps ; mosaics , tombstones , souvenirs ' of every age and kind were scattered over Italy or given to favourites of the Curia . For this splendid age , with all its achievements in architecture and town-planning , its generous patronage of every art and its honour to successful artists , had its seamy side . The sordid tales of nepotism and intrigue that defile the history of the popes in the seventeenth century are matched by occasional references to equally unsavoury disputes among architects . Professional rivalry was sometimes acute , and when Borromini was appointed architect at St. Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then envious , and finally the enemy of his master , endeavouring to supersede him in all his offices ' .1 Lastly , though a long and successful career had brought him fame , he came to the conclusion that his reputation was still inferior to Bernini 's , fell into a state of melancholy , and had to be put under supervision , but succeeded in getting possession of a dagger one night and committed suicide . Another typical story relates how an architect made his fortune . Domenico Fontana , having left his native village in Lombardy at the age of twenty to study architecture in Rome , was employed by Cardinal Montalto to design a chapel in S. Maria Maggiore , and a small palace adjoining : but Pope Gregory XIII , having deprived the cardinal of his income , thinking that his building was an evidence of too // great riches , it was suspended for want of funds ; but Fontana being attached to the cardinal and to the building , sent for 1,000 crowns , which he had saved by his own industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This act of generosity made the fortune of Fontana . Soon after Cardinal Montalto became Sixtus V and Fontana the pontifical architect . ' 1 The number of books produced by architects of this period is considerable , but the bulk of them are concerned with the Orders and their application . The writings of Vignola , Palladio , and Scamozzi on this somewhat dreary topic were translated into foreign languages and spread all over Europe . Thus Vignola come to be the mentor of French architects and Palladio of our English predecessors . In spite of the antiquarian interest of these vellum-bound folios with their fine engravings , they have wrought incalculable harm to the spontaneous development of individual design in this country and others . A torrent of them poured from the printing-presses of Italy , France , England , Germany , Belgium , and Spain , from the six-teenth to the eighteenth century . Vitruvius became the architects ' Bible , ' writes Sir Thomas Jackson , . . . The effect has been to bring the Art into bondage to formula , to enslave practice to theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical pursuit ? in fact , instead of the architecture of freedom and imagination , to give us the architecture of the book . ' 2 Yet an age and a country that was guilty of so much pedantry also gave us the buildings of Bernini and Borro-mini , who certainly made use of the Orders , but in a way that must have caused Vitruvius and his later editors to // turn in their graves . And we must admit that books on the Orders were not the only output of architectural scribes of that day . A measure of comic relief is provided , quite unintentionally , by Domenico Fontana 's pretentious folio recounting his heroic exploit in erecting the obelisk in the Piazza di S. Pietro at Rome . In the following century Carlo Fontana , by order of the Pope , wrote a lengthy description of the Vatican including St. Peter 's : this was not entirely a historical study , as recommendations were made for replanning the area surrounding the Vatican group of buildings . Other architects wrote on mathe-matics , perspective , hydraulics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lambardo produced a small book on the floods of the Tiber ; Ignazio Danti wrote a life of Vignola ; Palladio , a good classical scholar , published an annotated edition of Caesar 's Commentaries ; and F. M. Preti in his Elementi di Architettura ( 178o ) actually condescended to refer to Gothic construction , magnificence , and unity ' .1 But the chief attraction of architectural books of the period is the high standard of the engravings that illustrate them , and even , in many cases , form their entire contents . Palladio 's own drawings of ancient Roman buildings have both an artistic and an antiquarian value ; the Bibiena family 's designs for theatres are magnificent examples of draughtsmanship . Domenico Fontana 's book , already mentioned , on the obelisk at St. Peter 's , contains a wonder-ful engraving showing the obelisk being actually raised into position , the complicated scaffolding and shoring being made to enhance the decorative effect of the com-position . During the seventeenth century the same high level of illustration was not maintained , but , in the // eighteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including ( in addition to the Bibiena family , mentioned above ) Canaletto , Mauro Tesi , Panini , and , above all , Piranesi . The Library of the R.I.B.A. contains a fine and representative collection of the work of these artists , and the illustrations in Sir Reginald Blomfield 's book , Architectural Drawing and Draughtsmen , give an idea of the brilliant technique and exuberant fancy that characterizes them . But few of these draughtsmen were practising architects , and it will be noticed that the names of Bernini and Borromini are not included . Bernini 's style of draughtsmanship ( see fig. 29 ) betrays the sculptor . His bold use of light and shade , his free handling of the human figure , alike reveal the predominant bent of his taste . In regard to actual working drawings . Sir Reginald Blomfield writes that those ' made by such men as Bernini and Borromini are inferior to the drawings of Bramante , Peruzzi , and the two Sangalli . Those that I have seen are not worth reproducing ' .1 In addition to the R.I.B.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period should refer to the drawings preserved at the Soane Museum , including works by Francesco Bibiena and Panini . In the Museo dell ' Opera del Duomo at Florence there is a set of six wooden models made by leading architects between c. 1586 ? 1635 for the completion of the west front of the cathedral . Some of these are coloured , and the scale varies from about 12 to 31 feet to 1 inch . At the conclusion of this , the first of three chapters dealing with architects of the Renaissance , one can hardly avoid a comparison with conditions during the preceding // centuries , and the most striking contrast between the two periods , so far as we are concerned here , lies in the emergence of the architect 's personality . I have already argued at some length that the medieval master-mason was in fact the prototype of the modern professional architect , that differences of status and training were largely due to prevailing social conditions , and that his much exaggerated anonymity was usually a matter of compulsion rather than choice . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all doubt as to authorship , even as to the most trivial details of an architect 's career , swept right away by Vasari and others , who took pride in record-ing the achievements of all the great artists of their time and their country . Do we lose or gain by this additional knowledge ? In a recent and striking study , a well-known novelist and critic has considered this question ? He is primarily concerned with literary anonymity , but on one page he says that the Cathedral builders left their works unsigned ' That is relatively but not absolutely true , as I have pointed out , and even in this present commercial age few architects sign their buildings . Mr. Forster 's main argument is , however , that , in the case of what he calls creative ' literature , anonymity of authorship is a positive advantage to the reader , whereas in informative ' literature we gain by knowing the author 's name , so that we may judge whether his facts are to be relied on and take proceedings against him if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics that Gothic architecture acquires an additional glory because they are ignorant , or pretend to be ignorant , of its designers ' names . They argue that its beauty is largely due to its spontaneous and traditional evolution , // as contrasted with the formal and sometimes pedantic work of the Renaissance , with which architects and their pattern-books of the Orders were so actively connected . ' That argument has something in its favour : formalism and pedantry are not the most attractive of qualities . But to my mind we lose nothing by knowing a little of the names and lives of our great architects of all periods ; otherwise this book would never have been written . One 's admiration for Michelangelo 's ceiling at the Sistine is not affected one way or the other by having read Vasari 's detailed account of its painting ; nor does one judge Cellini 's art by any of the moral standards that he so conspicuously ignored in his life . But it is important that our criticism of all forms of art should be well-founded and that writers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names or the personalities of architects , should not ascribe authorship to supernatural or ecclesiastical sources when they are aware that some trained man must have been responsible . It is , therefore , for justice and truth that I plead in this book ; though I think that most of us experience an added interest in studying an old building if we can picture the methods by which it came into being . The marks of the adze on the oak , the curious masons ' marks on the stone , the effigies of master-masons with the emblems of their craft beside them , seem to bring the Middle Ages more vividly before us . And certainly , if one had to choose between Vasari 's Lives and Palladio 's Orders , there is no doubt which work most of us would select . So far from the human interest preventing our critical appraisement of an architectural masterpiece , it should heighten our interest without in any way affecting our judgement . VI THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE A COLLECTION of biographies of French architects , from the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy nearly a century ago , ' yet though it tells us much of his own not very valuable opinions about their buildings , it fails to present us with a vivid picture of their lives and methods of work . Sir Reginald Blomfield considers that Quatremere de Quincy was one of the most ferocious and dogmatic pedants that ever lived ' . But the lacuna in English archi-tectural literature concerning the French Renaissance has been amply filled during the past fifteen years by the publication of important books by the late Mr. W. H. Ward , 2 Sir Reginald Blomfield , 3 and Sir Thomas Jackson , 4 in all of which the position of the French architect has received attention , Sir Reginald Blomfield especially having treated the subject in great detail . Even for the purpose of this brief study it is convenient to divide the period into three stages : the first lasting up to the appearance of the professional architect about 1550 , the second from that date up to the foundation of the French Academy of Architecture in 1671 , and the // third to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in England , medieval architecture and medieval methods persisted at least a century later than in Italy . The medieval master-mason is therefore found in France up to 1550 or so , and of his status during the preceding century , when so many wonderful buildings were erected in France , singularly little is known . The problem is greatly complicated by the fact that there was a constant influx of Italian artists into France for fifty years from 1494 , when the French invasion of Italy made the king and his courtiers familiar with the buildings of the Renais-sance in the latter country . Among these artists were several architects , notably Fra Giocondo , Domenico da Cortona , and Serlio . It has been contended that the influence of these men on French architecture was slight , that the amount of building executed by them was almost negligible , and that such architectural masterpieces as the chateaux on the Loire only became strongly influenced by Italian motifs at a time when most French architects studied and measured for themselves in Rome . This is the view advanced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Dimier , an enthusi-astic admirer of Primaticcio , would ascribe all the credit to the artists who came from Italy . Sir Reginald Blomfield , who has little admiration for work of the early Renaissance in France , grudgingly concedes the authorship of a few designs to the Italians , but is loth to admit that the French master-masons had any architectural qualifications what-ever , and concludes that the great buildings erected during the reign of Francois I were mainly the work of masons and other craftsmen directed by the king himself or by other architectural amateurs ' . Sir Thomas Jackson , on // the other hand , says that we owe the buildings of the early French Renaissance to master-masons of the medieval type Finally , Mr. Ward , whose lengthy survey of this period was published almost simultaneously with Sir Reginald Blomfield 's first two volumes , takes a moderate and judicial view about midway between the four others already mentioned , but does not support his statements with many references to original documents . Thus we are faced with a startling divergence of opinion among three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we find equal dis-agreement among French critics . Nor do they ( except Mr. Ward ) display any doubt or diffidence in stating their opinions . What , then , are we to conclude ? To whom do we owe the designs of the great chdteaux of the Loire , of Blois , of Fontainebleau , of St-Germain ; of churches such as St-Eustache at Paris , and St-Pierre at Caen ? Were they the work of Frenchmen or Italians of architects , masons , or royal amateurs ? In this period , at any rate , we are spared the suggestion that they were designed by inspired ecclesiastics ; but here , almost as much as in the case of the Middle Ages , there is need for common-sense in facing so controversial a problem . At the end of the fifteenth century , when the invasion of Italian artists began , the directing personage on a building in France was , as I have been at some pains to prove in Chapter IV of this book , the master-mason , who did what drawing of designs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comptroller representing the building owner , individual or corporate . He usually , but not invariably , resided near his work ; often under-took only one job ' at a time ; and was largely trained // at the bench . ' He was reasonably well paid , and occupied a good social position . Occasionally , in the Middle Ages , he acted as the contractor or builder ' , and Sir Reginald Blomfield , quoting the original documents relating to Francois I 's early work at Fontainebleau , seems to have proved conclusively 1 that Gilles Le Breton , the mason , undertook the masonry contract there in 1528 ; that other building tradesmen signed contracts for carpentry , slating , tiling , and so on ; and that the work was controlled by an Italian who is generally called valet-de-chambre and only once architecteur , but whose duty it was to check the accounts of the building and transact the secretarial business connected therewith . He received an annual salary of ' , zoo livres , probably equal to as many pounds sterling in pre-war ' values 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no proof that Gilles Le Breton is thereby absolved from all share in the design of the Fontainebleau buildings . Another interesting case , also quoted by Sir Reginald Blomfield , 3 refers to Chambord , where in 1556 Jacques Coqueau , the master-mason , received his wages for preparing drawings and specifications for carpentry and masonry and super-intending the work ' . Now the same author appears to ascribe the original small-scale model for Chambord to Domenico da Cortona , an Italian architect , who must have made it thirty or forty years before ; but this model did not include the central staircase which remains its most striking feature , and is apparently the work of the master-mason . Even if the Italian supplied the pre-liminary idea of the design , it is clear that at Chambord // the master-mason was a resident architect with consider-able power of initiative , and that to him we owe one of the architectural marvels of France.l Sir Reginald Blomfield 2 and Sir Thomas Jackson 3 agree in stating that the business ' of a master-mason often descended from father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breton , Chambiges , and Grappin ) ; and the latter authority says that this fact seems to imply something material to inherit , such as a builder 's yard and plant . He does not , however , envisage , as he might , the possi-bility that the goodwill of an hereditary architectural practice is also a thing worth handing down . Returning to the question of design , we may now com-pare the different opinions of the eminent writers already mentioned , to see how far they agree as to the position of the master-mason . M. Palustre and his disciples hold that in Gilles Le Breton , the Chambiges , and Pierre Nepveu we are to recognize architects who need not fear com-parison with those of any country . Sir Thomas Jackson assumes that the first architects of the early Renaissance in France held exactly the same position as the master-masons of the Middle Ages . He insists that there must have been one man who designed the building and pro-bably also supervised its construction . The general conception of the design was due to the master-mason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an original work ; and the details were filled up under his general supervision by the workmen , whose training taught them exactly what to do to realize his intention .... It is evident that after general instructions had been given to the master-mason , as to what the employer wanted , accompanied or not by a model on a small scale , he was left to carry the work out The Renaissance in France ' 95 in a traditional way . Philibert de 1'Orme in fact tells us so ... . He says the employer consults some master-mason , who draws and submits some single plan , and when this single plan is accepted , he is left to his own devices in executing the work . The owner naturally would often visit the building , as Francois I seems to have done , and would make suggestions sometimes useful , more often perhaps injudicious and troublesome . But practically the master-mason , as Philibert describes him , was the architect . ' ' Mr. Ward is rather less definite in his conclusions , but seems to favour the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . He says that few of these men were architects in the strict sense of the word ' , but were masters of some one art or craft , and were able to draw . The bulk of the work necessarily fell on the native maitres d'oeuvres and their men . The French master-masons and master-carpenters held positions which approximated , accord-ing to circumstances , to those of architect , clerk of works , or contractor , and occasionally combined these functions . The race of medieval craftsmen who built the Gothic castles and cathedrals , originating the designs and making their own draw-ings , was dying out . With some brilliant exceptions , such as Martin Chambiges of Beauvais and Roland le Roux of Rouen , the maitres d'oeuvres had sunk to the rank of working con-tractors and were neither able nor called upon to initiate designs . ' 2 Thus Mr. Ward , without denying that the noble patron or employer often played an active part in the design of a building by suggesting the incorporation of ideas or details culled from Italy , assumes that somebody acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02 // in some ancillary craft , or else one of the brilliant excep-tions ' , that he mentions among the master-masons . Sir Reginald Blomfield is more dogmatic but not more convincing . Can we ' , he writes , in these earlier examples trace the hand of an architect ? If , for example , a building shows conspicuous individuality and an architectural quality of its own , the conclusion must be that an architect was at work here , no matter what the guise under which he appears in documents , whether valet-de-chambre , maker of models , or master-mason . On the other hand , the fact that a man repeatedly appears in the accounts for certain buildings as " master of the works " would not prove that he was an architect , if those buildings are precisely similar to many others of the same period , and do not , in fact , show any personal quality of design . It may be that Le Breton at Fontainebleau was an architect in all respects on the same footing as De 1'Orme at Anet . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chambiges , Le Breton , Grappin , and Bachelier ? that is , some of the most brilliant men of their time ? were at their best competent building tradesmen , men who not only contracted for work , but worked with their own hands in the shops and on the building ; but who , so far as it can be ascertained , did not in any way fill the role that was played by Bullant and De 1'Orme a generation later . ' 2 At Fontainebleau , where an army of French building craftsmen and Italian decorative craftsmen had been employed since 1528 , the same writer says that no archi-tect appears in the accounts till 1541 , when Serlio of Bologna , peintre et architecteur , is granted a salary of 1,600 livres ( say L1,600 ) a year plus an allowance for // travelling expenses of 20 sous ( say ? , I ) a day ? Sir Reginald Blomfield then notes that Serlio , although holding this apparently important position and drawing this handsome salary ( subsequently reduced to 400 livres ) was not con-sulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important room in the palace . After indicating what part of the building was designed by Serlio , he proceeds to attribute the initiative here , as in many other great royal palaces , to Francois I himself , who certainly had a passion for building . The fact was , that it was not till the middle of the sixteenth century that the French noblemen realized the necessity of serious and detailed designs for buildings , beyond the models prepared to the dictation of the employer . There is an ominous sentence in Du Cerceau to the effect that the King ( Francois I ) was so well versed in building that it is hardly possible to call any one else the architect of his palaces . ' 2 But we have heard this sort of thing before in previous chapters : and it will arise again in Chapter VII . The abbot or the bishop in the Middle Ages had the word fecit carved after his name on the building he had in-augurated but not designed ; the sycophantic architect of the eighteenth century , in the grovelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to attribute divine qualities to the noble patron who paid for printing the book . We must not forget that Du Cerceau himself dedicated the second volume of his chief book to the Queen of France , 3 and that he had every reason for flattering the royal family and its forbears . It appears to me that in this case Sir Reginald Blomfield is hardly just to his own profession , though generally he // is one of its stoutest defenders . All through the early chapters of an otherwise great book he seems to be possessed with the idea that the buildings erected in France between c. 1500 and c. 1550 attain so low a standard that they do not deserve the name of architecture . It may be for this reason that he attributes them to royal amateurs or to uneducated masons ; but with his main assumption he will surely find many critics , including the present writer , utterly at variance . He says of Blois , Fontainebleau , Villers-Cotterets , and St-Germain that they are great agglomerations of building details which , when sifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common-place motives strung together without serious thought of com-position , without that anxious consideration of scale which alone justifies the claim of buildings to rank as architecture . If therefore Chambiges . . . and other worthies are to be con-sidered as architects and the founders of the French Renais-sance , one can only say that they were very poor architects with very little sense of the possibilities of their art . I do not believe myself that they either were or were considered to be anything of the sort . They were just working builders . ' ... 1 Yet the same writer admits that the irregular planning of all these four buildings is partly due to the fact that they rest on medieval foundations.2 Equally severe criticism is made of other buildings of the period , some of which are said to be irregular and haphazard ' , 3 others exhibit-ing little individuality ' , 4 and almost all indicating that no architect was employed . At Ecouen , for example , where the château ( 1532 ? 42 ) seems to me to reveal the hand of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually commends its extreme simplicity of plan ' and the ' admirable placing of the The Renaissance in France i qq building on its rock above the town ' , he adds that , all these matters were probably settled by ' the owner of the building , a man of violent temper ' , rather than by the master-mason , Charles Billard. 1 Why ? So also at the Chateau of Madrid ( 1528 ) near Paris , now destroyed , we are told that the control of the archi-tect is conspicuously absent , 2 a statement which is certainly open to question . In this building , as at La Muette ( 1541 ? 8 ) and at Ancy-le-Franc ( 1537-46 ) , the symmetry , balance , and formal planning seems to me to indicate the hand of the architect in every line . In fact La Muette was carried out by Pierre Chambiges , who agreed to carry out the work as specified and as shown in the portrait . ' 3 Finally we come to those beautiful chateaux in Touraine which attract so many visitors from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm of such buildings as Chenonceaux , Chambord , Azay-le-Rideau , or Villandry lies in their ruined and tumbledown condition ( though admittedly that is a great attraction to minds of a certain type ) , because they are very well pre-served and one only longs for the formal gardens that once surrounded them . No , the charm of Azay-le-Rideau , for example , lies principally in the originality and grace of its design , as studied a bit of grouping as ever an archi-tect achieved . There is nothing accidental or haphazard about it ; and yet we know nothing of its designer . Villandry ( 1540 ) is a very different building , severe and formal in spite of its steep roof and its dormers ; just what an enemy of the Renaissance would call an archi-tect 's design ' , but its author is unknown . Yet Sir Reginald Blomfield concludes his paragraph about these chateaux with this chilly sentence : A cool // and critical study of these buildings will show that they are not the last word of a consummate art , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfamiliar language . ' The swing of the pendulum is a recurrent phenomenon in architectural criticism , and the passage just quoted may not have permanent value . But the purpose of my present study is history rather than criticism ; I have quoted three distinguished modern writers at considerable length in an attempt to reconcile their views and to ascertain the truth about the French architects of the first half of the sixteenth century . We must now turn to the Italian architects and other artists already referred to several times in this chapter . At first they were mainly concerned , as in England under the Tudors ( see Chapter VII ) , with minor decorative work or with tombs , and , though much of this work is of high artistic importance , it does not affect the story of the architect . Italian monuments were plumped down in the midst of incongruous surroundings and so were the Italian artists . From Naples , for instance , twenty-two artists of all kinds were imported , and these included two women.2 There were colonies of Italians at Amboise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , be it noted ) and elsewhere ; while at Fontainebleau a large number were employed . Of all these , only the following have any serious claim on our attention here : Domenico da Cortona ( nicknamed IZ Boccador ) , Primaticcio , Fra Giocondo , Vignola , and Serlio . Domenico da Cortona , a pupil of Sangallo , arrived with the first invaders ' in 1496 , but for thirty-five years or so we only hear of him // as valet-de-chambre to the queen , as a furniture-maker , and as a maker of architectural models . The last-named occupation is the most interesting to us here , and at once suggests the question whether he made these models to the instruction of somebody else , or whether he himself was an architectural designer . In the first event , who gave him the instructions ? Surely not amateurs like Francois I and his courtiers , as Sir Reginald Blomfield seems to assume ? Could his employers have been the French master-masons ? These are questions that seem at present insoluble . At all events he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l which was begun in 1519 . Other early models were made by him for castles at Tournay and Ardres , also for bridges , wind-mills , and other works whereby he lost much money 2 In 1531 he was appointed architect for the new Hotel de Ville at Paris , for which he made the designs . Over the doorway was carved the words Domenico Cortonensi architectante ' . While so employed , he received a salary of 250 livres per annum , and had as his coadjutors a carpenter and Chambiges the master-mason . The last fact is significant but perplexing . In 1534 the municipal authorities had to remonstrate with " the architect " and his assistants for all going off to dinner and leaving the building to look after itself . ' 3 It is uncertain whether he had any hand in the design of the chateau at Blois ; but he was living in the town at the time ( 1515 ? zo ) when the north wing was being built . Mr. Ward attributes to him the design of the remarkable church of St-Eustache at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Primaticcio ( 1504 ? 70 ) has been the subject of violent // controversy . He appears at Fontainebleau in 1536 with a salary of 20 or 25 livres a month , and seems to have been a leading hand ' under Il Rosso , the master-decorator , and to have worked impartially in various capacities until 1559 , when , on the accession of Francois II , he was appointed Surveyor-General to the Crown . Yet there seems to be no evidence that he actually carried out any architectural work . 1 Fra Giocondo ( c. 1453 ? 1515 ) has been credited with many buildings in France , but the only one for which we have certain evidence is the Pont Notre-Dame in Paris . Sir Reginald Blomfield says that the legend ' of his employment at Gaillon has long been exploded but Mr. Ward , without quoting any evidence , says that he very probably acted as consulting architect ' there ; a and elsewhere suggests that he may have been the inspirer of the whole Loire school ' .4 He was in France from 1495 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while employed in the royal service . Vignola only stayed a few months in France and seems to have done no archi-tectural work there . Mr. Ward attributes the chateau of Madrid near Paris to Girolamo della Robbia , a pupil of Sansovino.6 Sebastiano Serlio ( 1475 ? 1554 ) is a more important figure in our story . We know little of his architectural work in France : he held a well-paid appointment at Fontainebleau , and may have designed the chateau of St-Germain , which , like that of La Nluette , seems to bear the stamp of Italian sobriety . But , like so many architects , he achieved im-mortal fame by producing a book of the Orders , and // thereafter the French masons were thoroughly drilled in the Manner of the Ancients ' . It is refreshing to find Sir Reginald Blomfield admitting that with increased knowledge came a tendency to preciosity ' , and a conse-quent neglect of local tradition in the use of materials.i Fortunately , tradition died hard in France as in England , and the massed attacks of the Vitruvians never entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many attractions of French buildings of the early Renaissance . In this half-century , then , we find both French and Italian architects . Their status is very uncertain , but it is clear that the Frenchmen were survivors of the medieval system , and the Italians heralds of a new dawn , when the light of the Orders came to illumine the dark world of Gothic ignorance . Sometimes we have a taste of that astounding versatility that we have seen in Italy ; thus IIugues Sambin ( 1520 ? 1602 ) who began as a joiner like his father , later became borough-surveyor of Dijon , built a slaughter-house , a drinking-place , and windmills there , diverted the river , improved the fortifications , carved a Last Judgement ' and , many other subjects , arranged a triumphal progress , designed the Hotel de Ville at Besancon , and published a book of Termes , ' containing eighteen astonishing plates of terminal figures . ' But such versatility appears to have been exceptional . I have already said something of the methods by which buildings came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been largely used at this period . They were generally of wood . The model made by Domenico da Cortona for Chambord was 4 feet long , 3 and , as the // main front of the chateau measures some 512 feet , must have been made to a scale of rather more than 10 feet to an inch . Plans were also used , but we know very little about them , and I have been unable to discover any records of drawings preserved to-day which would enable us to judge of the draughtsmanship of the period . Sir Reginald Blomfield observes that it is doubtful whether measured drawings were made of old buildings which were altered , or whether working drawings to scale of new buildings were made ; 1 but , on the other hand , we have no evidence to the contrary . A devis or detailed specification formed the basis of every building contract . The famous example from Fontainebleau , dated 1528 , has been preserved . The section containing the masonry and brickwork is a docu-ment of some 25 pages and about 16,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the numbers and sizes of rooms , the staircases , chimneys , thickness of walls , and the materials ; with details .... ' 2 I can find no reference to the architect 's staff , and very little to the method by which young architects acquired their training . Mention has b , pen made of the masters under whom some of the Italians studied before coming to France ; and doubtless a similar system prevailed among the French master-masons ' . But Mr. Ward says that from the third decade of the sixteenth century onwards , one young Frenchman after another set forth thither i. e. to Rome to pursue his studies before settling down to his career ' .3 By the middle of the century , then , France had come into line . Books of the Orders were available , students went to Italy to measure the ruins of // Rome , and at last the professional architect , under his present name , appears in his modern form . From our point of view it is unfortunate , as Sir Reginald Blomfield has remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century included the names of a number of first-rate architects , yet of these only two were mentioned by Perrault in his lives of illustrious men of the period , l and one of them was the author 's own brother . However , Sir Reginald himself has gone far to remedy this lack by publishing the four great volumes in which he traces the architecture of the period with a patient scholarship and critical ability that is sometimes wanting in works of this nature . An architect himself , he has never lost sight of the personal aspect of his subject , and he is keenly interested in the methods by which the buildings under discussion were produced . Yet even his monumental work fails to enlighten us on certain details of the architect 's training and profes-sional career . During the period c. 1550 ? 1670 , some ten names stand out : those of Philibert de 1'Orme ( c. 1515 ? 70 ) ; Jean Goujon ( c . I005 ? 10 ? c. 1564 ? 8 ) ; Jean Bullant ( 1515 ? 78 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacques Androuet du Cerceau ( c. 1510-15-C. 1585 ) ; Etienne Martellange ( 1569 ? 1641 ) ; Jacques Lemercier ( 1583 ? 1654 ) ; Pierre le Muet ( 1591 ? 1669 or 1680 ) ; Salomon de Brosse ( before 1562 ? 1626 ) ; and Francois Mansart ( 1598 ? 1666 ) . Eight of these were quite certainly architects in our sense of the word , Du Cerceau was an architect who spent most of his life in making drawings and imaginary designs , and Goujon , who is chiefly known as a very talented sculptor , 2o6 The Architect in History is assumed by Sir Reginald Blomfield to have acted as ghost ' to the architect Lescot ? Architecture seems to have run in families in France at this period . We have already seen how the business or practice of the earlier master-masons became hereditary ; and now we find families such as those of De 1'Orme , Du Cerceau , Metezeau , De Brosse and Lemercier ; to be followed in the later period by those of Mansart , Gabriel , and Blondel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous member , in other cases an architect 's son or nephew surpassed his father or uncle . So , of the seven architects from our original ten of whom there is any record , we find that four were sons of men engaged in some branch of architecture or building , one of a distinguished lawyer , one of a painter , and one of a soldier . Information about their training is disappointingly meagre , but the case of De 1'Orme is interesting . Accord-ing to his own statement , from his earliest youth he had devoted himself to new inventions , consulting the most learned men in Europe in geometry and the sciences necessary for architecture It must be remembered that he was the son of a builder in a small way , living in Lyons not in Paris , yet he managed somehow to get to Italy and began measuring ancient buildings , which ' , he says I did with great labour , charges , and expenses , so far as I was able , not only in ladders and ropes , but also in excavating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being followed by a number of men , some to earn their two centimes a day , others to learn , for they were workmen , cabinet-makers , carvers , and the like , who wished to know what I was doing , and get the benefit of what I discovered . ' // In my last chapter I pointed out how many Italian architects of this period owed their subsequent career to some lucky encounter with a cardinal or nobleman while engaged on their studies from the antique in Rome . So De 1'Orme too had the good fortune to attract the attention of a passing Cardinal with his retinue , and by this meeting laid the foundation of his large practice in later years . According to De Quincy , the cardinal witnessing the zeal and progress of the young artist , received him into his palace , and took pleasure in furthering his educa-tion ; he also induced him to abandon the use of the French foot when measuring old buildings , and to adopt in its place the ancient Roman foot , of which he gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were preserved . ' 1 Yet though De 1'Orme came into prominence by way of his archaeological studies , and though in middle life he published a famous book on architecture to which I make reference later , his considerable reputation as an archi-tect ' , according to Sir Reginald Blomfield , is due to his careful study of building construction and his unusual skill in it ' , 2 rather than to his artistic ability . He did actually revolutionize building methods in France , and it is here that he stands apart from , and indeed ahead of his contemporaries , for Lescot , the elegant Court gentle-man , left these matters to his builders , and Bullant , fine artist as he was , approached architecture too exclusively from its artistic side ' .3 But in another passage the same writer observes that De 1'Orme fell into the pitfall that has tripped up many an architect , the snare of archaeology , and an over rigorous science ' .4 Bullant states definitely , zo8 The Architect in History in his book on architecture , that he measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemercier are said to have done the same , but the evidence is incon-clusive ; Le Muet first appears as a model-maker in France , and Francois Mansart is supposed to have been trained by his brother-in-law , a French official architect , so it is unlikely that they studied in Italy . There seems to be no record as to whether the remaining three of our ten architects travelled in Rome or otherwise . But the publication of book after book on the Orders , in French as well as in Italian , may have rendered the enthusiasm for study in Italy a little less keen by the middle of the sixteenth century ; students were probably content to acquire their knowledge second-hand . Again quoting Sir Reginald Blomfield : As was , perhaps , natural with men intoxicated with their new-found learning , the use that they made of their gleanings in Italy was rather pedantic . The orders loomed large and formidable in the forefront of architectural study . To design the orders in strict accordance with the proportions found in the remains of Classical Rome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , was the first ambition of every architect . ' 1 Apart from the Orders , we know very little about the nature of an architectural student 's curriculum . Lescot did drawing at school when he ought to have been minding his books ; at twenty he was studying architecture , paint-ing , and mathematics . Goujon , whose artistic ability is unquestioned , wrote in an introduction to Vitruvius in 1547 that a knowledge of perspective , geometry , and the books of Vitruvius is essential for an architect . The French mind is practical by nature , and it is not surprising // that the first good book on building construction , full of new ideas , came from Philibert de l'Orme , l in spite of his archaeological training . We may safely assume that a young architect in France at this period studied the Orders , perspective , geometry , and mathematics ; and possibly mechanics and other branches of science too . I can find very little definite information as to the date when these men commenced practice , and the question is complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments which do not seem to have precluded private practice . An analogous case would be that of a draughtsman ' in our own Office of Works to-day , who occasionally designed a house and eventually gave up his appointment to devote himself to private work . But it seems certain that Francois Mansart , of whose youth we know next to nothing , began his huge practice in his early twenties and was a flourishing architect within a few years . Work was obtained almost always through private interest , as a competition , open or limited , is hardly ever mentioned . When the scheme for the Pont Neuf at Paris was mooted in 1577 , various projects were submitted to Henry III . When the King had selected a scheme the details were worked out by the King 's architect Baptiste du Cerceau , son of the famous architectural draughtsman ; and afterwards a committee of experts , corresponding to the Spanish junta described in Chapter IV , was appointed to watch over the progress of the work . Still , this can hardly be called a competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel de Ville at Lyons is little more satisfactory . In 1646 the city fathers of Lyons decided that a new town hall should be built . // They therefore gave instructions that plans were to be obtained from their own city surveyor and from certain other architects ( apparently by invitation ) . The surveyor was then to proceed to Paris with all the plans ; and was to consult with various notable architects there , especially with Desargues , one of the competitors , and to obtain the opinion of the Governor of the province . It is difficult to imagine any arrangement affording more opportunities for intrigue ; and the result was , as might be expected , a deadlock . The Governor favoured one design , the city fathers another , and the surveyor waited his opportunity . The design of Desargues was finally accepted , the surveyor carried it out ; but he altered it in execution so unsatis-factorily that he was dismissed in 1661 and is said to have died of chagrin ' in 1668.1 It may be added that Desargues was a celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one . An architect sometimes consulted others ; and when Salomon de Brosse was preparing sketch-designs for the Luxembourg ( 1616 ) he sent the one which the queen preferred to Italy and even to other countries ' , in order to obtain opinions and criticism from the most prominent architects of the day.2 Of all architects ' clients during this great building epoch , perhaps Cardinal Richelieu was the most profitable , for his enormous income was matched by his powers of imagination . His town house in Paris , later known as the Palais Royal , is said to have cost 10,000,000 livres ; but he surpassed it when he commissioned his architect , Lemercier , to prepare plans for a vast chateau in Touraine , big enough to house the whole court ; and next instructed him to lay out a whole town to serve the chateau and to // house its menials . All this work , including the town of Richelieu ' , was duly carried out and may still be seen . ' Another costly house of this period was Maisons , still standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and surroundings . Francois Mansart was the architect . He was a fastidious person , already well-established in practice , and after going down to view the site with his client he undertook the work only on con-dition that he had absolute carte blanche in regard to expense . Everything was to be of the best . He seems to have gained his point , for the cost of the building is said to have been 12,000,000 livres . Yet the total size of the building ( two storeys high ) is only about 240 feet by 90 feet . He appears to have suffered for this extravagance in later years , for , after having been appointed architect to the great church and monastery of Val-de-Grace in Paris and having carried the building 9 feet above ground , he was superseded by Lemercier , partly as a result of political intrigue but partly because the promoters of the scheme were becoming frightened of his recklessness.2 Though a great architect , he suffered from two generous a supply of the artistic temperament , and this was his undoing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could not even decide which of his own sketch-designs should be submitted to the king . This condition appeared harsh to a genius accustomed to independence , and so he preferred to sacrifice such a favourable occasion for the exercise of his talents , rather than give up his freedom to change his ideas if any better occurred to him ' .3 Another story relates that Bullant the architect used to read for   // hours to the workmen employed on his buildings , but this seems to be an ill-founded legend.i Some of the greatest building enthusiasts of the period were the ladies of the Court , respectable and otherwise . Of the second group the most important was Diane de Poitiers , who seems to have had as much of a passion for building as Henri II had for her . A holiday in Touraine leaves one with the impression that her initials appear in every château there . Her rival , the queen Catherine de Medicis , must have been a permanent thorn in the flesh to all the architects whom she employed . Sir Reginald Blomfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent in France in the earlier part of the century , and the worst of it was that her taste was extremely bad and extremely obstinate . Having little real insight into the arts , she insisted on interfering at all points in the design of her buildings , overrode the suggestions of her artists , and insisted on their carrying out her ignorant caprices . ' She built a number of houses , of which her fifth contained among other things a lofty Doric column with a newel staircase formed inside , intended to form an observatory for her astrological efforts . ' 3 But one beneficial result of the increasing part played by women in building schemes was an improvement in the standard of domestic comfort and hygiene , sadly needed in the seventeenth century . In this movement the leader was the Marquise de Rambouillet , a clever woman , who seems to have seen that these arrangements might be much improved , that private rooms should be provided as well as public , that service staircases were indispensable , that cabinets t // de toilettes , salles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near bedrooms instead of at the other end of the garden , that the cavernous chimney openings of the sixteenth century took all the heat up the chimney when they did not let all the smoke back into the rooms , and when the Hotel de Rambouillet was to be built she endeavoured to realize these ideas . ' 1 So far so good , but Sir Reginald Blomfield discounts the next anecdote . Des Reaux has a pleasing story of youthful genius , and describes how the Marquise , discontented with the design pro-posed for the Hotel de Rambouillet , suddenly called for draw-ing-paper , and then and there made the design of the house , which was followed in every detail . ' . . . There is simply no evidence worth the name to support the legend of the reform of architecture by the Marquise de Rambouillet . All architects of experience know how much they can learn from the taste and individuality of their clients , and there can be no doubt that the Marquise was original enough to have views of her own as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determined enough to see that they were as far as possible carried out . But to lay it down that a young lady of twenty-two , with some little accomplishment in drawing , revolutionized the great and slow moving art of architecture , ex mero motu suo , is asking too much of the credulity of historical students . Moliere bitterly remarked , " Les gens de qualite savent tout sans avoir rien appris " . The Marquise de Ram-bouillet 's claims to architectural genius rest on no better foundation . ' 2 On the whole these architects of the seventeenth century appear to have been competent professional men and there is little doubt as to their status . Both De 1'Orme and the younger Du Cerceau had an interest in stone-quarries , but the only definite instance that I have noted of an // architect acting as a contractor occurs in the case of Salomon de Brosse , who bought quarries for the stone-work at the Luxembourg and provided all the plant and materials for that building , which he also designed . There was some trouble about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by another contractor . ' The desirability of separating the functions of architect and builder was made manifest by frequent cases of embezzlement and dishonesty , and the example of De Brosse , exceptional at so late a date , affords an excellent instance of the need for such differentiation of function . For better or for worse , the architect in France was now recognized as an expert in design on the fashionable Italian lines , and gradually the master-mason architect , clinging tenaciously to the French Gothic tradition , was frozen out of existence . It must often have puzzled visitors to France to account for the very distinctive character of her Jesuit churches , and Sir Reginald Blomfield explains this in an interesting chapter . The practice was for the architect of the Order to prepare designs and specifications , which were faithfully adhered to in essential points , whether the building took five years to build or fifty . These plans and specifications were handed over to the local people for execution . The Jesuit architect visited the work from time to time to settle difficult points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have superintended the work from start to finish . ' 2 This method does not seem to have been altogether successful , for Martellange , the most famous of these Jesuit architects , had a good deal of trouble with con-tractors over practical and financial questions , and one // is inclined to suspect him of being somewhat of an amateur . Lemercier , though a general practitioner , was in close touch with the members of the Order in Paris , and built a large number of important churches . But specialization by architects was rare . Most of them undertook all classes of building , and several of those already ' mentioned must have had enormous practices . A good deal of what we now call engineering ' was included in their work . Thus Philibert de 1'Orme who , as we have seen , came into the limelight as a student of Roman antiquities , was appointed at thirty years of age Conductor-general of buildings and fortifications in Brittany . His duties consisted of visiting twice a year all the ports and fortifications of Brittany , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems also to have seen some active service and to have taken part in a siege . I have already mentioned Baptiste du Cerceau 's design for the Pont Neuf . Another architect , Lemercier , was sent in 1620 ( at the age of thirty-seven ) with an engineer ' to report on a bridge near Rouen . This is one of the first cases we have yet encountered of any distinction being made between engineering work and architecture , both of which had hitherto been done by architects . Another instance occurs in the design of the Place Royale , now the Place des Vosges , and the Place Dauphine , both in Paris , by the brothers Chatillon about 1607 . Sir Reginald Blomfield , apparently quoting Sauval , describes them as engineers ; ' 2 but Mr. Ward calls Claude Chatillon architect and engineer ' , which is probably the truth . These squares were laid out as part of a scheme for improving Paris inaugurated by Henry III , and form admirable early examples of town216 The Architect in History planning on modern lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already mentioned , which is symmetrically laid out on a rectangular plan and well planted . No description can convey the old-world charm of this delightful little town , far away from the main track of travellers and tradesmen , and slumbering peacefully amid its planes and lime-trees . In its way it is unique , a page of the seventeenth century preserved to us intact , and more suggestive of the spirit and purpose of the architecture of the time of Richelieu than any other building that has reached us. ' 1 It was designed by the architect Lemercier , who may also have laid out the small fortified town of Brouage near Rochfort , planned like Richelieu on rectangular lines .2 Lemercier was also employed on the fortifications of Paris . Besides town-planning , architects now undertook the lay-out of gardens for the larger town houses and the great chateaux that were springing up all over France . Much of this work is admirable , showing that , long before the days of the famous Le Notre , garden-design was success-fully practised . Though architects still carried out works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other arts , and on one occasion Poussin the painter had a great quarrel with Lemercier the architect about the decora-tions of the Louvre .3 The position of Jean Goujon the sculptor is obscure ; but Sir Reginald Blomfield is con-vinced that in reality he was a talented architect who acted as ghost ' to Lescot ; that is , that Lescot , himself a courtier with influence in high places , obtained the work and drew the salary , but employed Goujon to do it for // him ? Such a practice , despicable as it seems in cold print , is doubtless to be found in all periods , certainly at the present day , and seems inevitable . Mention of a salary raises the whole question as to how architects of this period were remunerated . In spite of Sir Reginald Blomfield 's learned researches , and the pro-fusion of figures that he cites in the course of his two volumes , I find myself utterly at sea as to the real position of the salaried architect ; moreover there is only one mention , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an annual salary . A salary is frequently mentioned . It appears that 1,200 livres was usually paid to an architect of good standing in the employment of the Court . Bullant received this sum in 1557 as Controller of building operations , Primaticcio at Fontainebleau in 1563 , Lescot as architect to the Louvre in 1550 and again in 1568 , Jacques du Cerceau the younger as Controller and Architect of Royal Buildings in 1602 , Jacques Lemercier as one of the architects of the royal palaces in 1618 . But this was not an invariable rate of payment . Louis Metezeau in 16o8 drew 2,400 livres as architecte du Roy , but he was also concierge et garde des meubles du Palais des Thuileries . Le Muet received 3,000 francs for his work at the Val-de-Grace in 1655 , but this salary'was later reduced to 1,000 francs per annum . In 1618 Salomon de Brosse received 2,400 livres as one of the royal architects , subordinate architects received 1,200 and Boo livres , and Pierre le Muet ( jeune garcon ) was retained by her Majesty to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 livres . The largest salary of all occurs in 1585 , when Baptiste du Cerceau is said to have had 6,000 livres a year as ordon-nateur-general of royal buildings , but he gave it up rather // than become a Catholic . It is impossible to attempt any accurate estimate of the value of these salaries in modern purchasing-power , opinions differing widely as to the value of the livre . ' And even more perplexing is the position of the salaried architect . Was he paid for the whole of his time , or was he at liberty to undertake private work too ? Most of the leading Court architects of the sixteenth and seventeenth century built churches , town houses , and chateaux while in the royal employment . Again , could an architect who was paid for work on one specific palace draw another salary simultaneously for work on another palace ? These questions have an interest beyond their merely financial aspect , and if an answer could be found to them it would clear up many difficult points about work in France at that period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , it appears that occasional perquisites occasionally found their way into the pockets of the state architect . Thus Philibert de 1'Orme , who was accused by his enemies of making zo , 000 livres a year in all , held four sinecure abbacies which brought him in 3,300 livres a year , and was also made a Canon of Notre-Dame , though the Canons objected to his beard ( see fig. 30 ) . Such cases seem to have been exceptional , but it is significant , perhaps , that Lemercier receives special mention for declining bribes from contractors , and for being an honest man.2 But we have seen that Baptiste du Cerceau declined a large salary rather than give up his religious convictions ; and another famous Protestant artist , Jean Goujon , as penalty for having attended a Lutheran service in 1542 , was condemned to walk through the streets in his shirt and to attend the burning of the preacher . ' Salomon de Brosse , though of the same faith as Goujon , managed at a later date to design churches impartially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more eminent of the French architects of this period occupied a good social position . The inordinate vanity of Francois Mansart , according to Mr. Ward , 3 prompted him to a display more suitable to a duke . He caused a pedigree to be drawn up , according to which his ancestors had been architects to every king of France , from Hugh Capet in the tenth century downwards , and drove about in a coach drawn by horses trained to a rhythmic step ' . Yet Sir Reginald Blomfield , who admires Francois Mansart as much as he detests Jules Hardouin Mansart , says that the former had no capacity for self-advertisement ' .4 The pedigree and the rhythmic horses seem to belie that statement . Of the ten architects chosen to represent this period , five at least published books . De 1'Orme intended to compile a vast encyclopedia of architectural knowledge , but did not live to complete it . His first published work was Nouvelles inventions pour bien bastir et a petitz frais , and was chiefly concerned with the construction of timber roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ text-books ) , domes , and arches by building them up in thicknesses instead of cutting them out of heavy scantlings . Fig. 31 is taken from this book , and is typical of his draw-ings of constructional details . In 1567 he published a great folio entitled L'Architecture , in nine books . In this volume he deals successively with sites , masonry , building materials , the Orders according to Vitruvius and other
