Perfecting Verbal Abuse <P> Reinhold Aman is the name in pejoration , not to mention invective , vituperation , obloquy , opprobrium , objurgation , abusive epithets and billingsgate . Aman , 41 , is the editor of Maledicta , the International Journal of Verbal Aggression , which he publishes irregularly out of his home in Waukesha , Wis . He can curse in 200 languages and , with the possible exception of Don Rickles , he is the only American who makes a full-time living out of insults . <P> His goal is grandiose : to collect and analyze every offensive term ever used on the planet , and to make Aman synonymous with malediction the world over . Says he : " I 've spent eleven years on it , day and night , working like a demented beaver because so much has to be done . " <P> The first issue of Maledicta ( " bad words " in Latin ) is now in the hands of 1,480 subscribers who pay $10 per year . It contains scholarly dissertations on such subjects as Yiddish insults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accusative Tendencies in the Skopje Dialect . Other articles include a bracing harangue by Aman himself , directed at academics who do not appreciate his life 's work ( " biodegradable nitwits " and " cacademoids , " a neologism formed from " academic " and the baby-talk word for feces , " caca " ) . The coat of arms of his International Maledicta Society is a 3,000-year-old obscene Egyptian insult in hieroglyphic . <P> Aman thinks cussing is socially important-It releases pent-up emotions and reveals crucial information about culture and psychology . Among other things , he is studying the language of German prostitutes and Peruvian criminals , American college slang , Mojave insult gestures and the terminology of Chinese eunuchs . In an Olympics of world cursing , he believes that Yiddish would rank high , and Hungarian would win the blasphemy prize hands down . Also notable are Turkish rhymed insults , deadly serious Eskimo singing duels and a sneaky insult in Hindi that translates literally as " brother-in-law " but actually means " I slept with your sister . " In general , says Aman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catholic countries are fond of blasphemy , and cultures of the Middle and Far East are partial to ancestor insults . <P> Americans , Aman says , are " generally very poor at swearing . They just do n't know how to do it , and usually fall back on the same 24 words or so . " What talent there is in the U.S. apparently is found in rural areas and the Deep South . " There you get concrete vivid images that come out of a strong oral tradition-Billy Carter is a good example . City dwellers ' vocabularies are very anemic . " <P> Aman has a tip for Americans wishing to improve their verbal-abuse techniques : " Look for a distinguishing characteristic . Each of us is deviant in some way . For instance , I wear glasses , I 'm five-foot-seven , 20 pounds overweight , have short hair and a Kissinger accent . So you could start off calling me a fat , four-eyed , runty , reactionary , sewer-mouth Kraut . " Still , he considers it unsporting , and sometimes destructive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Insults should be aimed at behavior , something a person can change . "
