A new urban policy spreads its benefits thinly <P> Two years ago Candidate Jimmy Carter promised the nation 's mayors that if he became President , they would have " a friend , an ally and a partner in the White House . " The pledge delighted the mayors and won him the enthusiastic support of many urban blacks , whose votes provided his margin of victory . This week , after a series of delays and bureaucratic bungles , the President is finally preparing to put his words into action . In a televised address from the White House , he will present his new urban policy , which he describes as " a new partnership to conserve America 's communities . " <P> As outlined by Administration aides last week , Carter 's policy seeks to offer something for just about everyone , but almost no one will be entirely satisfied . The " partnership " offers-several innovative and much needed new programs . But for the most part , it is a repackaging of existing ones . Moreover , reflecting Carter 's promise to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say miserly-grip on the purse strings . He intends to add only an estimated $3.5 billion to the $85 billion to be spent to aid states and cities in fiscal 1979 . <P> But Administration officials argue that the policy nonetheless represents a major change of direction by Washington in its treatment of urban problems . Says Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Patricia Harris : " Probably the most important policy change is that all programs and activities of the Federal Government will be examined for their impact on urban areas . That 's not sexy . That 's not jazzy . But it is very important . " <P> Carter 's statement on urban policy was born amid bureaucratic fumbles and intense infighting . Two months after his Inauguration he set up a committee composed chiefly of six Cabinet members , headed by Harris , to work out the policy . Harris and HEW Secretary Joseph Califano were immediately at loggerheads . He favored programs that would directly help poor people no matter where they live ; she wanted to get money into distressed urban areas . Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that would reduce tax revenues , resisted proposed tax cuts or incentives for businesses located in distressed areas ( Carter finally overruled him ) . To make matters worse , some participants regularly leaked early drafts of various proposals from the committee 's working sessions , causing spirited lobbying of the Administration by Governors , mayors and community leaders . <P> The committee 's first two drafts of an urban policy were rejected by the White House as poorly put together and too costly ( about $10 billion a year ) . Harris and her colleagues fell so far behind schedule that Carter could not obtain an estimate for his fiscal 1979 budget . As a result , the Office of Management and Budget came up with its own-$3.9 billion - which was also rejected . Furious at the foulups . Carter told Domestic Affairs Adviser Stuart Eizenstat to whip the policy into shape . Within two months , he and Harris produced a ten-page outline that Carter liked . In a note to " Pat and Stu " the President gave his go-ahead . " My whole family will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
