txt TALKEETNA , Alaska  --  The great Alaskan land rush is only a few months away , but Jonathan Yoder already has his slice of Alaska . Yoder , 31 , bought 160 acres of farmland for $325 an acre almost two years ago at a government auction , ending his eight-year search for land in Alaska . It was a dream come true . Yet even Alaskans who are accustomed to the hardships of this vast and wild state might argue whether Yoder and his family are living a dream or a Photos on back page , sec. 5 nightmare . It is a classic tale of the homesteader who tries to hack a livelihood out of a wilderness that is ruggedly magnificent , and relentlessly demanding . FIRST , THEY lived In a tent : Yoder. his wife , Reba , and their three small children , Telissa , 6 ; Gina , 4 ; and Jamie , 2 . Now they live in a two-room cabin that Yoder built of , packing crate plywood , a pitifully fragile structure set in the towering , snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no electricity , no running water , no Insulation against the 25-below zero cold that bites to the bone in an Alaskan winter . The windows are sheets of plastic . " It 's not much of a cabin , " said Yoder , grinning with a Yankee squaredlook that betrays some of his Pennsylvania roots . " But it was luxurious after an eight-by-ten tent . " The plywood cabin was meant to be temporary , until Yoder could build a stout log cabin . But Alaska has , a way of draining a man 's time , strength , , and resources . STILL , YODER endures It : " When I was in the ninth grade , I wanted to go to Alaska , get a piece of land , and build a farm on it . My contribution to mankind was going to be to develop northern agriculture and help feed a world that might be getting hungry by the time I grew up . I 'm working on the realization of a dream . " Millions of Americans with such dreams are focusing on Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with salmon and fields full of lumbering moose and bears . Hundreds of Americans have written to state officials here asking how to ap // Alaskan land ritsh dream or niffhtmare ? // ply for free land since voters here last Nov. 7 adopted the Alaska Homestead Act . Effective in February , it orders the state to give away 30 million acres Li 40-to-160 acre parcels to Alaskans , depending on their length of residency . THE ALASKA Supreme Court Is expetted to rule on whether the residency requirement is constitutional . If it is not , any American might , apply for Alaska land . " This could make the Oklahoma land rush look like a Sunday school picnic , " said a state official . But a long-time Talkeetnan , one of Yoder 's neighbors , put it this way : " There is no such thing as free- land in Alaska . It costs you very dearly moneywise , and you expend a great deal of yourself , your time , and your life . " YODER CAN testify to that . Ile is $50,000 in debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as he speaks , he keeps moving and working , cutting down four birch trees for fire wood to warm the makeshift cabin and fuel the cook stove . He plods through knee-deep snow , his eyes resting temporarily on eight penned cattle . " I 'd like to have 200 head , maybe 250 , " he said wistfully . That might take 10 years . Reba Yoder , 26 , Alaska-born and part Athabascan Indian , prepares dinner by the light of two flickering candles . " I ca n't call this hardship , " she said . " The only really hard time we had was last winter . This cabin is not insulated . It got to 25 below . The kids had to wear their coats and boots in the house . That really upset me . " TO MAKE MATTERS worse . Yoder was unlucky this year in his hunt for a moose to feed his family through the winter , so meat is bought at a small trading post 11 miles away , tripling the family 's food bill this year . Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such hardships . As one Talkeetnen put it : " People come here prepared ror everything but what is here . " ; ; -. : de officials say the new Homestead ' Act might backfire on Alaskans who : thought they were voting to gain the ' land for themselves , not for Californians kw Illinoisans . ALASKA GOV . Jay Hammond warns tot land speculators with " dollar signs in : . their eyes , " and ownership by people " who are not interested in settling in : Alaska . The sponsor of the Homestead Act , State Rep. Mike lleirne of Anchorage , said he does n't care who gets the land as long as it falls into private hands . Earlier , homestead laws were so complex , he said , that hardly anyone could qualify . As a result , only one million acres of Alaska 's 365 million acres are owned privately . Most of the land is owned by state and federal governments . MOST ALASKAN land costs several thousand dollars an acre , he said , because government controls have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Texas ... Opening 30 million acres to private ownership will force Alaskan land prices down to where they are affordable , said Heine . He argues that the move will boost the Alaskan economy by putting private land on tax rolls , creating new jobs , opening areas for farming , and encouraging people to sink roots in Alaska . THERE ARE AT least half a dozen ways to get land in Alaska , all of them difficult until now . Yoder is often cited around Talkeetna as an example of a homesteader in the truest sense of the word : a settler who builds . a cabin and makes a living off the land . There are others living in the bush country . on five-acre homesites , out beyond Talkeetna , and unreachable except by air , on foot , dog team , or snowmobile . They are a clannish bunch , often resenting visitors . Townfelk scornfully call them " hippies " who have moved back to nature .

There Is a sense of quiet desperation and fear that someone will ruin what they have built in the remote wilderness on the southern foothills of Mt . . Bill , who calls himself a " woodsman " rather than a homesteader , said most of his friends work on construction jobs for three or four months in Fairbanks or Anchorage " to make our grub stakes , " then they live on their homesites the rest of the year . , " Before the Homestead Act , only people willing to put in a lot of effort got a place , " said Bill . Ho fears a land rush . Rep. Beirne , who wants to open Alaska to all comers , was asked if the state will be inherited by strangers . And what of those who want to keep Alaska Lc themselves ?
