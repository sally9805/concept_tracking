No More Chemical/Biological War ? by Richard A. Fineberg For years , Fort Detrick was one of the most secret places in our country , dedicated to research on biological warfare ? perfecting the instruments of death . But last year we decided to convert it into a laboratory for research on cancer ? dedicated to the preservation of life . I visited Fort Detrick last year ? on the day I announced its conversion . I directed that it now should be thrown open to scientists from all over the world . It was in that spirit that Fort Detrick welcomed the Russian Minister of Health almost one year later . There he stood ? in a place which had once been the symbol of a closed world , a world of suspicion and confrontation . . . . Now this same place had become the symbol of an open world , a world of cooperation and trust . . . . Richard M. Nixon , November 3 , 1972 In the year since the President 's order that Fort Detrick be rededicated ? from germ warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the fort 's main entrance has increased its operating budget by at least 50 percent and has augmented its staff . This must be part of the National Institute of Health 's cancer research program ? right ? Wrong . It 's the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) , and its mission is not cancer research . According to USAMRIID 's commanding officer , Col. Dan Crozier , MD , the institute 's primary task is " developing workable medical defensive measures against biological agents . " That appears to be consistent with the President 's 1969 policy statement which allowed for continued research into " defensive measures such as immunization and safety RICHARD A. FINEBERG , a reporter for Dispatch International , has been researching chemical and biological warfare for the past three years . measures . " But at the research level the line between offense and defense is blurred at best . " There is so close a relationship between offense and defense in any kind of fighting , " Dr. Theodor Rosebury , the author of Life on Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to deal with them separately . The defender must know the weapon with which he is to be attacked , and the attacker must understand the defenses he expects to breach . " Dr. Rosebury wrote that shortly after he left Fort Detrick , where he was in charge of the military 's airborne infection research program . The army acknowledges that it has trouble distinguishing between offense and defense . Col. Nelson W. Tobey , an army research and development officer , told the House Appropriations Committee in 1969 that " . . . security deletion percent of the work that we are doing under the CB program is offensive in nature , but it is very difficult to make any clear line of delineation between the two because there is such an intermingling . " In the case of biological warfare , the offensive skills of producing , stabilizing and disseminating disease agents must be mastered in order to devise a defense against them . The list of vaccines developed at Fort Detrick for germ warfare agents later produced at the Pine Bluff ( Ark . ) Arsenal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Army Research and Development Newsmagazine , Fort Detrick 's immunological achievements include vaccines for anthrax ( a dreaded scourge of the middle ages ) , tularemia ( rabbit fever , an incapacitating bacterial disease ) , and Venezuelan equine encephalitis ( the viral sickness that swept the southwest US horse population in 1971 ) , as well as botulinum toxin ( a lethal poison ) . All four of these agents were mass-produced and stockpiled in secrecy at Pine Bluff between 1962 and 1969 . Whether one labels it offensive or defensive , there is more than cancer research going on at Fort Detrick . In the year since the President closed out the offensive biological warfare program at Fort Detrick , USAMRIID 's budget for defensive biological warfare research has jumped from $4.0 million in FY72 to $6.1 million for the current fiscal year . An **28;2406;TOOLONG listing of army R &D; facilities provided to the House Appropriations Committee early this year indicates that USAMRIID 's staff is expected to triple during fiscal 1973 ? from 444 workers to 1326 . Is the intensified defensive biological research effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been amazed to discover , " then-Congressman Richard D. McCarthy ( D , NY ) wrote in 1969 , " that the US has absolutely no hard evidence of any Russian offensive biological warfare activity . " When McCarthy asked the Defense Department what measures were being taken to protect this country 's civilian population from biological attack , the Defense Department 's director of research and engineering , John S. Foster Jr. , informed him that CBW did not pose " a major strategic threat against the US . " Foster noted that although an inexpensive but effective protective mask had been developed , " no large scale production was undertaken because of the low estimate of the threat . " Col. Crozier reiterated this assessment in the July-August 1972 issue of Ordnance magazine , when he noted that " biological weapons are not considered a major strategic threat to the US population at this time . " Earlier this year a Fort Detrick researcher told me that there 's a general consensus at Detrick that the US is far ahead of the Soviet Union in biological warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense Department offered no explanation to Congress for the intensified defensive biological effort . ( In fact , the only indication of USAMRIID 's marked expansion is the personnel increase , which is buried in an 18-page listing that covered 94 separate facilities funded at nearly a billion dollars . ) Although the President promised to destroy " existing stocks of bacteriological biological weapons , " the army now says it has destroyed only the germs themselves , not the delivery systems . This is a significant distinction : The army is reluctant to discuss the technical details , but informed observers note that delivery systems for germ warfare agents require complicated mechanisms such as detonating devices and disseminating nozzles that can not be used for conventional munitions . The germ warfare agents produced and stockpiled at Pine Bluff were stored in bulk , according to Lt. Col. Bob Schuler of the army 's Pentagon news branch . " All biological agents for offensive use have been destroyed , but not the munitions , " Schuler says , and he adds that delivery hardware for germ weapons would be similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until mid-1972 to detoxify anti-crop and anti-personnel biologicals at four installations ? Pine Bluff , Fort Detrick , Beale ( Calif . ) Air Force Base and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal ( Denver , Colo . ) . At Pine Bluff the price-tag for killing the microbes stockpiled for anti-personnel use is estimated at over $10 million . The process , which took more than a year to plan and almost another year to carry out , included incineration and three distinct sterilization processes before the residue could be put through a sewage plant and the harmless remains spread into the soil at Pine Bluff . The army 's widely publicized biological agent destruction program did not include Dugway , where this reporter has learned that the army secretly destroyed biological agents before the official destruction program was announced . When I toured Dugway and the nearby Tooele Army Depot last year , I was not allowed to see the storage areas where germ warfare agents are reportedly stored . The Dugway Command admitted that " some biological agents , similar to those to be found in hospitals and medical schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dugway Proving Ground DECEMBER 2 , 1972 for use in epidemiological diagnoses . " The test tube quantities were not specified . One Dugway worker scoffed at the Command 's use of " test tube " and " laboratory " quantities . He told me he helped fill an unmarked truck that carried biological agents to a new storage facility in 1970 . In response to my request for definition of a " laboratory quantity , " Lt. Col. Leonard F. B. Reed , Jr. , chief of the army 's news branch at the Pentagon , helpfully informed me that " laboratory quantities of biological agents are those diagnostic specimens and research samples utilized in the conduct of defensive research . . . as outlined in the President 's 25 November 1969 statement . " The White House speaks of " dismantling " the biological warfare facilities , but a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration 's National Center for Toxicological Research , which has taken over portions of the biological warfare facility , told me that Pine Bluff 's large germ-producing fermenters have been " sealed off " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. T. J. Haley , a center spokesman , said . He added that there is " no present way " the new center could make use of the army 's giant germ-breeding equipment , though the reproduction facility could conceivably be of some future use . The question of biological warfare capability , then , is more complicated than the White House implies . The US maintains 1 ) unspecified quantities of microbes , 2 ) facilities to produce large quantities of germs , and 3 ) sophisticated mechanisms to deliver them . It is an oversimplication to say that the US no longer has the capability to wage biological war . Col. Schuler says that it might be more accurate to say the US still has " the capability to have the capability . " But the continued biological program is only one part of the CBW picture . Research on lethal chemical weapons has nearly doubled in the three years since President Nixon disavowed first use of these weapons . According to Defense Department figures , $8 million has been earmarked for research and development on lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this research was pegged at $4.3 million . Most of the $8 million is directed toward perfecting a new method of delivering nerve gas the army calls the binary system . In a binary weapon , two compounds in separate cylinders are mixed together on firing to form a lethal chemical payload . The army has said it intends to wait until the binary system , currently in the advanced stages of development , has been perfected before procuring additional lethal chemical weapons . According to a 1971 report by DMS ( formerly Defense Marketing Services ) , a private firm that provides information for defense contractors , the binary system " is expected to replace existing chemical stockpiles , since it eliminates almost all of the presently-feared handling and storage hazards . " Under the Nixon administration , total spending 19 for chemical warfare research , and development has dropped slightly , from $33.5 million in FY70 to $28.5 million in FY73 . The boost in spending for the binary nerve gas delivery system has been more than offset by decreases in research spending on such items as sublethal incapacitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Geneva Protocol of 1925 to the Senate for ratification , as promised . But the administration 's inclusion of an informal understanding that excludes riot control agents and herbicides from , the ban has stymied ratification for over two years . More than 90 nations ? including the Soviet Union and every major power except the US ? have ratified the 1925 prohibition against first use in combat of " asphyxiating , poisonous or other gases and all analogous . . . devices . " After holding hearings on the Protocol in March 1971 , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright wrote the President that many committee members felt that the administration 's unique interpretation " can not help but weaken the effect of the Protocol . " On behalf of the committee Fulbright asked the President to consider " whether the need to hold open the option to use tear gas and herbicides is indeed so great that it outweighs the long-term advantages to the United States of strengthening existing barriers against chemical warfare by means of ratification without restrictive interpretations . " The committee waited 18 months for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then published the inconclusive hearings . In the interim , the United Nations Conference Committee on Disarmament negotiated a biological weapons ban which the administration recently signed and sent to the Senate for ratification . ( The biological ban is limited to " development , production and stockpiling " of germ warfare agents ; the Geneva Protocol restricts only usage of these weapons . ) But negotiations on a similar ban for chemical weapons ( including all chemicals with no justification for peaceful purposes ) were stalled this summer while the conference committee waited for the promised US response to the Soviet-initiated draft treaty . The US counter-proposal never arrived and the conference committee recessed in September . While the administration delays its verdict on international agreements limiting chemical warfare , the army continues to instruct foreign military personnel in the strategy , tactics and techniques of CBW at the Ft . McClellan ( Ma . ) Chemical Center and School . Army spokesmen say there is no contradiction between this aspect of the CBW program and Nixon 's goal of establishing international restraints on gas and germ warfare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then commandant at Ft . McClellan , recalled in 1970 with a grin , " it got a little tricky a few years ago when we had Arab and Israeli students here at the same time . "
