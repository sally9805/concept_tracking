The situation of New York 's Franklin National Bank , until recently the nation 's 20th largest , has looked dismal ever since a gray day in May . Then the bank announced that instead of the $582,000 profit it had originally reported for the first quarter , it might have suffered a loss of as much as $39 million because of unauthorized trading in foreign currency by employees ( TIME , May 27 ) . Last week the picture suddenly turned $24.6 million worse . The bank reported losses of a numbing $63.6 million for this year 's first five months : $40 million in the first quarter , mainly because of the currency trading , another $19 million of currency losses in April and May , and more than $4 million of operating losses in those two months . <P> Within hours after making the figures public , Harold V. Gleason resigned as chairman and president , completing an almost total wipe-out of Franklin 's top management . He took the new post of executive vice chairman , and was succeeded as chief executive by Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Treasury during the last few weeks of Lyndon Johnson 's Administration . Frightened depositors continued to withdraw their savings . The bank lost more than $100 million in deposits last week , bringing withdrawals to $930 million , or almost a third of the $3 billion deposits that Franklin held when the bad news began to break six weeks ago . <P> Franklin has borrowed more than $1 billion from the Federal Reserve System since May and if it can continue to get such support it may yet pull out of its slide . The majority view , though , is that Franklin will survive only by merging with a larger bank , or perhaps selling off several of its operations piecemeal to other banks and shrinking back to its original base on Long Island . The bank 's ultimate fate may well hinge on the still incomplete story of what went wrong . Franklin and its employees are now being investigated by the FBI , the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
