little fire out of scraps from dead bushes , I cut me some bacon and fried it in the skillet , then borrowed a tin-cupful of water from a big shallow puddle in the field next to me and made up a flat chunk of pan bread and fried it in the grease nice and slow . I 'd scared off some long-legged gray birds smaller than chickens and skinnier , but they come to the puddle again when I 'd got back to the fire , and I set there watching them go wading a couple inches deep and poking this way and that down in the mud with their long , thin , pointy beaks . I could n't tell if they was finding anything , but they kept on doing it , wading and weaving and sometimes in a tight bunch and sometimes wide separate . And as I et my bacon and bread and watched , it seemed like I was getting a lesson . Them birds had picked a puddle that did n't look worth nothing , that was n't no different than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long gone and forgot by May if not sooner . But they was drawing their life out of it that evening , just like me , and happy to have it and know how to use it , finding things down in that muck nobody or nothing else knew how to find . And singing while they was at it too : short , high , far-off-sounding whistles like wind blowingacross broke straw . And maybe not even finding much , or maybe finding nothing till tomorrow but still happy to be there , now , doing what they liked to do . They flew off right at the last glimmer of dusk when the sky was going all ashy , not all of them together but a few at a time till there was n't but one left . He took a few more swipes at the water and maybe caught him a last grub or whatever , then took off after the rest , maybe spending the night flying somewhere for all I knew . Before it was plumb dark , I walked over there and scooped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and myselfand the Good Future , which I knew now had already started when I was n't looking . I had never traveled much , except for moving from Missouri to the farm , and I did n't remember a whole lot about it except getting sick over the side of the wagon . Besides , Pa was doing all that traveling , and me and Ma and Kit was just tagging along . It 's different when it 's you deciding where to camp and when to get up and which way to turn . Even the prairie seemed exciting because it was me pushing that wheelbarrow on it , alone out there on my ownp23two feet , not asking nobody 's leave to spit or whistle . I begun to feel alive , which I hope to tell you is the best way . Mid-afternoon of the third day , the wind dropped still and the sun come out blazing like June , and I tromped along through the quiet , beginning to feel strange . I felt like I was going uphill , which if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion your knees ca n't understand . Seemed like every time I put my foot down , the ground was there to meet it a little too soon , and when I seen what looked like hills up ahead of me  --  low and domy-shaped and bare and sort of bluish  --  and when I seen the soil underfoot was getting sandier and looser , I reckoned I was coming to the Platte . And right about then the wonders commenced . You 're going to think I 'm lying , but I do n't need to . I do n't mind a good lie , one with lots of decorations on it like a bandwagon that makes nice loud music and serves a little beer to help wash down the extra whoppers . ( A mean , bare lie is different . ) But I was never no good at lying . My ma was always saying , " Tell the truth and shame the Devil , " which I been trying to do all my life , and the truth always seemed stronger and dreadfuller and funnier and sadder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you feel so inclined and it wo n't cost you nothing but a little effort . First off , them hills looked to be maybe two miles away , so I walked two miles ( which happens to be 3,520 paces of mine unless I 'm gimped up or tuckered out ) , but when I done it , they still looked two miles off . Well , that 's no wonder , you might say , that 's just bad eyesight . Then I walked another two miles , and they was still two miles off . And how 's this for bad eyesight : halfway through that second two miles , I seen six men all dressed in black on one of them hills , just standing there like they was waiting for me . I got worried because I could n't figure out what no priests or undertakers would be doing out here , so I sheered off a little to pass them by . But when I got closer , they went skittering along the ground and rose up in the air and flew off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after they commenced cawing and I seen they was crows , the question in my mind was : how long had they been crows ? The hills left off playing their main trick then and stopped backingaway and let me get halfway up one of them , and I was so excitedto get to see whatever it was I 'd see when I got to the top , I had a little wheelbarrow trouble in the sand because these was sandp24hills . All sand . Just like I 'd read about on the edge of the ocean or out on the desert . By the time I collected my wits and turned the Millicent Slaughter around and started pulling her up the last slope , I 'd had my fill of loose sand and had lost my temper near as bad as Pa , but then I seen the giant . It 's all right to have sand hills with nothing growing on them , not even a blade of buffalo grass . I can put up with them . But over on the next one west of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was some kind of dark-brown shaggy-looking monster  --  man or animal , I could n't tell  --  and to make a short story tall , it was a good fifteen foot high . I dropped them handles where I stood , and if it had n't been sloggy sand , my wheelbarrow would of rolled halfway back to the farm by itself . I did n't move none , since I did n't want to stir up nothing'sappetite that was that thick and tall , and in a minute or two , the critter moved off over the slope away from me , shifting and jiggling its shape and shrinking down a bit and popping up higher than before and using six or eight legs to walk on and , at the last , just four legs like it was pretending to be an ox or maybe a buffalo . The second it had went over the further edge , I grabbed them handles and made it the rest of the way up the hill in one long splayfootedgallop , and I was over the top and down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the greatest wonder of them all so far : the valley of the Platte , the likes of which I have n't seen since and neither has nobody else . I thought I 'd seen a river before , and I had  --  the Missouri , when we 'd got ferried across at low water to get to our farm . But this looked more like an ocean is sposed to look , except it was yellow , and here where I 'd struck it , the valley looked five or six miles wide and the river took up dang near half of it . I could of been wrong , of course , since I was n't used to measuring distances like that , there being nothing much to stand on and see from back where I come from . But it was mighty broad and flat and full of islands and side channels and meanders and backwaters , and there was just too much of it to take in . The sun was flashing on and off now as some clouds come puffing out of the northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it looked like they had plenty to spare up high . I stood there a long while , awestruck , forgetting I 'd been a little scairt a while back . And I have found that to be the nature of wonders : if you try piling one on top of another , you start losing track of thep25first ones . A wonder takes up all your attention it can find and do n't leave hardly any room for memories . The air was shimmering and going light and dark as the sun blinked , and when I looked way off upstream , I could of swore for a few seconds I seen a lake higher than the river with skinny-looking upside-down houses beyond it , and I did n't know whether I was standing on my head or my feet . What brung me back to sober daylight was the sight of about a dozen tepees and doby lodges of a Pawnee village below me and off to the right on my side of the river , so I short-cut off left away from them down towards the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to . They was mostly quiet and easygoing , but they 'd only lost the land I was walking on a few years back , and some of them around home had n't got used to the idea yet . I did n't feel like it was up to me to do powwowing or peace-piping or tradingoff , since all 's I wanted to do was get on past , which I done . But while I went downhill , letting my wheelbarrow pull me for a change , I got to thinking : this other world had been laying out here all this time  --  not just laying but reeling and roving and gleamingand pitching  --  and I had been back home in the jail of my own head , not doing nothing to get away sooner . I felt shamed I 'd been only three days ' hike from all these marvels ( and maybe more to come I could n't even put a name to now ) , and had set and sulked and let Ma and Pa be the whole kitboodle of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corn , snow , or the end of my nose , I now felt flabbered and gasted and sort of joyful , like anythingcould happen , even something good . Where preachers ( or whatever ) could turn into crows , and critters taller than our house could roam around free and easy , and towns could float higgledywithers , why could n't I find me some gold and turn up happily ever after ?  |p26The  road was broad and looked to be well used , and whoever had laid it out had tried to keep it straight , even though the riverbankzigzagged something fierce , so sometimes you 'd be right by the water  --  which was thick and fast and yellow-shiny  --  and sometimes you 'd be off away from it a mile or two . The grass was n't up yet , and nothing else was growing along the river , not even a bush . I seen some cottonwoods out on the islands , and here and there across a backwater slough I 'd seen some driftwood laying on a sand hummock , so it looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I wanted firewood at night . I put it off as long as I could so 's not to have to take off my boots more'n once or lug the wood too far . I come to a crick which was n't but ten foot wide , but it was up and fast , and I was glad somebody 'd bridged it , probably last summer or fall during the first big rush to Pikes Peak . It was made out of fourinchcottonwood trunks , not thick enough for logs nor skinny enough for poles , and it looked like somebody 'd hauled off a few for kindling . But the dished-in rim of the front wheel just fit the curve on one trunk , and I pushed right across , keeping dry for a change instead of having to slog through like I done many a time with nameless little three-inch-deepers and three-foot-widers back on the prairie.  |p27And  I 'd only been on the road a mile when I met my first wagon  --  coming back , not heading for gold . Its cover was all weather-ripped and half-patched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockkneed , and it was being hauled by a mule and an ox that did n't look like they admired each other 's company none . The man holding the reins was a leather-cheeked , greasy-bearded old man with some kind of brown blanket tied around his head and shoulders , right over his cap and wool jacket . He stared at me and my wheelbarrow and let his team come to a halt , which they was inclined to do anyway , so I stopped too and set my handles down and says , " Howdy . " " Well , I hope you 're the last one I 'm going to see , but I doubt it , " he says . " Is there any more like you coming ? " " I do n't know , " I says . I wanted to tell him about the marvels I seen , but he did n't look like he 'd be interested . " I mean , you reckon you could possibly be the last of a new batch of damn fools ? " I started picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense , young man , no offense . I call myself a damn fool willingly and openly , and an old fool is a sorrier sight than a young one . Where might you be headed ? " " Cherry Crick gold fields , " I says , wary and standoffish now , like I recollected feeling toward Miss Wilkerson when she 'd get me trapped in a dumb answer . " I 'm sorry to hear it , " he says . " You aim to push that contraption all the way ? " " Push or pull , I reckon . " " Will you accept a piece of advice from an old man who is sadder but wiser ? " he says . " A man old enough to be your father , maybe even your grandfather ? " " Well , sir , I already had about as much advice as I can carry , but if you want to unload , go right ahead , " I says . He looked at me real solemn and shook his head a little  --  or maybe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you come from , no matter how poor and miserable and godforsaken it may have seemed to you . I 'll even give you a ride to Council Bluffs , if you want one and if these two bone-baggy critters can make it that far . " " No thanks , " I says . " That 's what all the rest of them ahead of you told me , " he says.  | " Son , you know what you 're looking at ? You 're looking at a widower . I left my wife back there thirty-eight miles from Pikes Goddamn Peak under a heap of rocks because the ground was too froze to make a grave , and it was the same as if I kilt her myself . " " I 'm sure sorry to hear that , " I says . " But I have n't got nobody to kill but me . " " Do n't go , " he says . " You 'll find more gold in the nearest dentist 's office than ever you 'll find in that jughead 's paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to . It 's a hoax . You 'll get skinned . If nobody else happens to do it in time , you 'll skin your-self . " " I 'm much obliged to you for your  --  cautions , " I says . " But I mean to get ahead in this world . " " Yes , I reckon I 'm a caution , all right , " he says . " What 's lying ahead of you , son , is not this world at all , but the bunghole of the next . Or the previous , not sure which . " He flicked his reins at the ox and mule , but they did n't pay him no more mind than me . " If you make it as far as Fort Kearny , tell them Andrew Murchison made it at least as far as Elder Creek , no thanks to them . " " All right , sir , I will , " I says . " I hope you have a change of heart , young man , " he says , flickingharder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . " Well , I got a change of socks anyway , " I says , and we passed each other by . I did n't take no offense , but that 's the way they like to do , lots of them old men : they want to take that smile off your face and get you squinting and squirming and feeling useless . Why should I believe him when I 'd just seen I could n't believe my own two eyes ? I shoved on another couple miles with the road dipping down into near-bogs now and then but mostly staying straight . And the sky up ahead turned some brand-new colors and the sun glancing low off the sand and making it and the river golder than ever . When I come to a place where a funny kind of ditch about a foot and a half wide cut all the way down from the top of the sand hills across the road and into the water ( like somebody had took it into his head to make a crick and then could n't find no water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on camping . The ditch , near a foot deep some places and all chopped-looking , had knocked out a chunk of the riverbank so 's the water was easy to reach , and I could fill my cup or canteen without no trouble . I was hungry and was going top29need a fire for my bread and bacon , but the only wood I could see was over on a sand bar with fifty yards of water between me and it . I took off my wool jacket and my gray slouchy hat , which I wear dished in fore and aft to cut down on the head winds and the brim turned up in front so 's I do n't look like Pa , and took off my boots and socks and jacket and tied my yellow slicker around my neck ( I was going to need something to haul the wood in ) , and I was ready to have my first go at swimming the Platte . I had n't swum nothing wider than a duck pond , but I had faith I 'd be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked up scairt about it , I went down that little ditch to the edge and jumped in feet first . And clang near broke both legs with the surprise of it : the water only come halfway up my pants , and though the bottom was soft and runny-feeling and quicksandy , it held me just fine , and then I learnt another wonder : it never got more'n three foot deep all them fifty yards , though I could feel the current staggering at me in the middle . Later I come to find out there ai n't many places in the whole river that 's over a grown man 's head , and why it do n't just all steam off in the summer or sink in the sand , I do n't know . After I 'd got me a slicker-load of sticks and driftwood , I waded back , started a fire , and begun rustling up supper . Naturally , the first thing I needed was a cup of water to make dough , but when I seen the color of it , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was putting out its last level shreds now , and when I come to pour off the water , I seen the cup was a third full of fine sand . I tilted it into the light and give myself a terrible turn : it was full of bright little speckles like gold . I squatted there on my hunkers just staring at it , not saying or doing nothing . It did n't seem possible the whole river could be full of gold dust and nobody 'd noticed it . I tried to calm myself down and think reasonable , but the idea kept jumping up like something trying to climb out of my throat . Cherry Crick ( and Slab Crick too ) flowed into the Platte , and did n't they say Cherry Crick was full of gold ? What was to keep some of it , maybe even most , from washing out and coming all the way down here and saving me 450 miles of shoe leather ? Maybe people had been drinking gold for years , been wading and washing in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming by . Suddenly I broke out of that squat and dug my big tin pie plate out of my wheelbarrow and emptied that yellowy sludge into itp30and got down to the water 's edge and commenced trying to pan it out the way old Abner Nickles had showed me how to do one day in town . But the light was getting worse now , and far as I could see , pretty near all the sludge wanted to slop right out of the pan with the water and leave nothing behind . I was going to have to wait till daylight , and maybe even then plain ordinary panning was n't going to work . I made my bread in a kind of foggy trance , telling myself not to be a fool and yet going right on being one , scheming up ways to get that gold out of the water by myself but not rightly knowing how . Maybe that was how they used quicksilver , but I had n't brought none and would n't of known what to do with it anyhow . I et my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint and sharp and a little crunchy , and how was I going to keep from going loco in the night ? And how could I stake a claim to a whole river ? A claim was only good for a hundred foot , and I 'd get an extra hundred as discoverer , but what was to keep somebody from getting upstream of me and filtering out all the gold before it ever got to my two hundred foot ? What if claims got staked all the way upstream to Fort Kearny and past it to the North and South Forks and along the South Fork to Cherry Crick ? Then where would I be ? The Platte would probably be running clear by the time it got to this place . For a long while I fretted and stewed and simmered by my small fire , turning rich and poor every other minute , rubbing that pie plate with a smudge of sand in its bottom like it was a magic lamp , and swelling up into a great man and shrinking back down to a small , mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old time of it . I set there wrapped up in my blanket and wrapped up in gaudy dreams , poking sticks into the fire nice and slow and saving the big chunks so 's they 'd last while I got to sleep ( if I could ever sleep again ) , and I did n't hear nothing till a man 's voice says , " Evening . " He was standing upstream of me about fifteen foot off , which was about as far as the firelight went , and he looked bulky in a short , thick , dark jacket and some kind of cap . I nodded and howdied him back and kept setting . He says , " Mind if I set a spell ? Do n't have any firewood , and I saw yours burning . " " You 're welcome , " I says , but I did n't feel like he really was . I had wanted to go on pipe-dreaming without a pipe.  |p31He  come closer , stepping over the ditch and circling to the other side of the fire . " Name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he did n't offer to shake hands , I did n't neither . " Ike Bender from near Plattsmouth , " I says . " You coming or going ? " he says , hunkering down and holding seven blunt fingers and one thumb , which was all he happened to have on him , out to the fire . He had a half inch of black-and-gray stubble on his face and a bent red nose . " Heading west , " I says , and I tried to tuck my pie plate far enough under the blanket so 's it might seem like something I et out of . " Pretty fancy rig you got there , " he says , tipping his chin at my wheelbarrow . " You must be an ambitious young man . " I do n't know how to talk to people who say things like that , so I usually say something just as dumb or keep still . For no reason , I remembered what I 'd heard a drunk yelling outside the Wagonwheelone afternoon last winter , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , but I 'm on my way . " " Maybe I can be some help , " he says . " I been out in the gold fields all fall and winter . I been up and down every crick and gully there is . Maybe I could trade you for some good advice . " That made me feel real uneasy , so I says , " I 'm going to join up with my brother 's company , and I ai n't got nothing to trade . " " I could use a little food , " he says , gruff-sounding , not begging . He looked pretty fat in the face to me . " I do n't hardly have nothingmyself , " I says . " And I got a long ways to go . How bad off are you ? " " Well , I et a little yesterday , " he says . " But I 'm not any too sure about tomorrow . " I knew I 'd ought to feel bad and charitable , but I says , " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way . I 'd sure be obliged if you could find somebody else to ask it off of . " He warmed his fingers some more , and I could see his eyes workingover me and my belongings . " You 've still got eighty miles to Fort Kearny . You must have more than just a little or it 's going to be bellybutton-to-backbone . " " Well , it 's all I got , mister , " I says . " Aw , come on , " he says . " Do n't be selfish . You can always buy some more at Fort Kearny . " " I got nothing to buy it with , " I says . It felt like a lie because I had five dollars , but I did n't want to tell him.  | " Well , just how far you aiming to go ? " he says . His voice had more of a rough edge along it now , and I did n't like the way he was looking at me , and if there 'd been someplace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and went . " Near Cherry Crick , " I says . " No money , only a little grub ? What 'll you do when you run out ? " " I reckon I 'll go as far as I can , " I says , and then I do n't know what made me say the next thing , it just come out of my mouth : " Then maybe I 'll turn into a crow and fly the rest of the way . " He set there squinting at me over the low fire and nodding a little , and he says , " You know , there are n't any fish in the Platte . Not a one . " " Did n't look like there was , " I says , getting more and more worried but trying not to show it . " Maybe you figured on doing a little hunting , " he says . " I could give you a few pointers . Course , a lot depends on what kind of gun you got . " I opened my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut it and changed to a different tune . " I do n't enjoy killing nothing , " I says . " Not my line . " " Maybe you 'll take a liking to buffalo-chip soup , " he says . There was n't no good answer to that , so I just studied him and the fire a bit more , and then I says , " I can spare you some fried dough and bacon if you do n't mind the way I make it . " " I wo n't mind , " he says , sounding offhand and not very hungry . I stood up , keeping my blanket on and taking my cup the few steps down to the dark river . " And I will trade for a little advice , " I says , scooping up a cupful and bringing it back and letting the sand and ( I hoped ) the gold dust settle in the bottom . " I 'd be glad to oblige , " he says , not sounding glad about nothing , but gruff and level and well-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you go about panning gold dust if it 's real fine and mixed in with real fine sand ? " " Well , you can pan some of it in the regular way if you 're real careful and blow the dry black sand out later on , but you 've got to use mercury to get enough to count . " I sliced off the smallest hunk of bacon I could without feeling Ii stingy , and I says , " Is that the same as quicksilver ? " " Yes , " he says . And while I was at it , I let him get a good look at my **31;1578;TOOLONG spear-point hunting knife which I stuck back under my belt when I 'd finished with it . " Spose I could get me some quicksilver someplace ? " I says . " Maybe at Fort Kearny ? " He grunted , which I guess was his way of laughing . " Might as well buy gold while you 're at it , " he says . " Ca n't even buy calomel or corrosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury in them . " I put the skillet on with the bacon , and I seen his lip curl up more and quicker than the bacon when he seen the size of it , which was n't much smaller than what I 'd had myself . And that one third of a cup was setting there by the fire , maybe with enough gold in it to buy some quicksilver with , which I needed so 's I could get the gold out in the first place . " How you fixing to buy quicksilver and you with no money ? " he says , smiling sort of unpleasant . " I could work it off , " I says . " I 'm a welldigger by trade , " which was the most likely one I could claim . I dropped the flattened-out piece of dough in with the bacon and let it sizzle . He stood up a little too sudden , then relaxed and smiled when he seen I was watching him close . " This is a right nice act of charity , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" So you could practice up on us , starting about right now . " I stayed crouched by the fire and knew I was going to have to get busy pretty soon and save my bacon and my Future . Meanwhile , I says , " Who 's Sam ? " " Oh , he 's a friend of mine about fifteen foot behind you there , " he says . " Sam 's shy and scairt of the dark , and that 's why he carries the gun instead of me . Ai n't that right , Sam ?

Raising his voice a little , the man calling hisself Frank says acrossp34the low fire and the skillet , " No gun , least not in sight . Hunting knife in his belt . That 's all . " The voice behind me says , " Now stand up nice and be a good boy . " But I could n't see no use in that , and if I let them take the little I had , I 'd be Bound to Sink instead of Bound to Rise , so I leapt forwardwithout ever coming out of my squat and went from the frying pan to the fire : I landed flat on the skillet and the fire both and rolled hard sideways , scattering the sticks and dousing what light there was . A gun went off in back of me , loud as doom , and Frank made a grab at me but was too busy yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went flying every which way , but nothing caught fire , and what with the clouds , it was a real dark night and hard to see more'n a few yards , so I kept in a deep crouch , still clutching my blanket around me , and found the edge of the ditch and went scuttlingup it , fast and quiet , getting a little distance while the commotionlasted . Pretty soon they had enough sense to quit hollering what to do and keep still and listen , but by that time I was thirty yards up the slope , sprawled in the ditch , facing them with the blanket flat over me , and they could of walked right across me and never known I was there . I heard them whispering angry and quick , and then Frank yells , " Hey , you , what's-your-name , do n't do nothing foolish now . " Which I had no intention of doing , but the hard part was telling the difference between what was foolish and what was smart . " Get that goddamn fire going so 's I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was more whispering back and forth , and then Frank says , " You could n't hit the side of a barn if you was standing indoors of it . " Then they talked low some more , and I heard them rummaging at my oilskin . Laying down like I was , I could see their outlines crouched over my wheelbarrow , and it give my heart an awful pain to know they was going through my things and taking what they pleased , which I 'd had so much trouble getting together . " Get me some light , " Sam says , and Frank says something back , and Sam says , " Aw , do n't be a Nervous Nellie , he 's just a kid . " " With a knife , " Frank says , and they lowered their voice . I seen one of them go back to the fire and pick up a couple ofp35sticks with red coals on the ends of them and commence blowing at them , and pretty soon a small flame popped up and he took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the other one went on rummaging . " He 's got his money on him , " Sam says loud enough for me to hear , and Frank hushed him , and they whispered some more , and then in a big full rough voice Frank says , " Tell you what we 're going to do , boy . If you come back here right now , nice and friendly , and just hand over whatever cash you got , you can keep your food and your kit and this damn machine here . What say ? " I had my five dollars but aimed to keep it for a five-dollar emergency , and this seemed more like about a fifty-dollar one . " We wo n't hurt you , " Frank says , and the flame went out but popped up again when he blew on it . " Think it over : just your money and we 'll call it square . " And if that was his idea of square , I did n't want to find out what he 'd call crooked , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this heap of kindling here , have ourselves a feast of bacon , and send your sack of flour back to Plattsmouth by water . " Well , I knew then I was going to have to turn smoky whether I wanted to or not . I could n't just lay there and let them burn my wheelbarrow , and I could n't just walk in with my hands up : Sam had shot at me once already and might like it better the second time . They 'd probably think me better off kilt and my body hid up in the sand hills or buried out on one of them little islands than having me talking my head off to the first wagon I run into . " Easy as pie , " Frank says , holding the skinny torch close to my crumpled-up oilskin and looking all around in the dark for me . They whispered and muttered some more and seemed to argue a little , and I begun crawling forward in the ditch , not really knowingwhat I was going to do or whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving because I had to . Before the flame puffed out again for the third or fourth time , I seen what looked like a long pistol gleaming in Sam 's right hand while he did some left-handed rummaging in my wheelbarrow but halfhearted now like he did n't expect there was nothing in it worth the bother . But it was worth any kind of bother to me , it furthermore being called the Millicent Slaughter whether there 'd been time to write it on or not . So I kept kneeling my way forward , keeping low andp36holding the blanket out on both sides so 's I would n't look like nothingmuch . When I was about ten yards off , I slowed down till I was just inching . Frank got a stick blowed alight again , but he was holding it too close to his face so 's he could blow on it and holler too , and I was sure I could see more by it than he could . Yelling , he says , " You got exactly one minute , boy , and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right direction , south , but too high and too far , and I could tell they thought I 'd cut and run and was n't up close like this . Still standing by the wheelbarrow at the edge of the shallow ditch , Sam was gazing off west someplace into the dark , maybe listening more'n looking . I dug my toes deep in the sand to get a good start and left my knife in my belt because I did n't want to hurt nobody bad , and I lunged forward at Sam  --  fast and knee-high  --  and he seen me just before I whaled into him , and he spun halfway around , bringing that long-nosed gun my way . It went off with a bang so loud I could n't scarcely hear it , and at the same time I knocked him dipper-over-bucket backwards into the river . I probably would n't of found the gun for a half-hour if it had n't hit me on the shoulder on its way down : Sam had left it behind , along with his sweat-soaked old hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running into him . I got hold of the gun and switched it around quick at where I reckoned Frank would be , but he was n't there . I stayed low , using the slightly paler sky to locate his outline but could n't find it . From over in the river Sam yells , " Get him , Frank . " But nothing happened , and Frank did n't say nothing , and again Sam yells , " Frank ? What 's the matter ? Get him ! " Just to keep everybody thinking , I loosed off a shot at the sky . I had n't never shot a regular pistol before , let alone a big old shorthandledmusketoon like this , and it was a good thing I had hold of it with both hands because it jumped like a jackrabbit . First there was the sound of Sam splashing further and further from the bank , maybe headed out to the sand bar to think things over , and after that , nothing but my ears singing and ringing . I stayed crouched , worried Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biding his time to jump me . Then I smelt wool burning . I made sure I was n't laying on any hot coals my own self , then begun groping around one-handed toward where my fire had been , and I run into Frank 's boots out flat and him in them.  |p37I  did n't want to strike no light with Sam still nearby  --  for all I knew he had another gun or at least a knife  --  so I hauled Frank off a couple yards by the boots and found the place smoldering on his jacket and rubbed it out . But there was no telling whether the fire or Sam 's bullet had done the burning . My hand come away sticky with blood , and I could tell by the way he was all sprawled still , he 'd been croaked . And just so 's there would n't be no doubt about it out in the river and so 's he would n't be expecting no more help from shore , I took a deep breath and yells , " You kilt him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and I did n't have all night to do it neither . I could just leave Frank laying right there and break camp and get my wheelbarrow going as many miles upstream as I could manage in the dark and just pretend like nothing happened , as long as I could get around Sam and keep ahead of him . I had n't done nothing wrong . Frank had been shot , and I did n't even own a gun , except there I was with it in my hands . Well , I says to myself , I can just chunk it in the river and who 's to know ? But if I did that , then I would n't have nothing to protect me from Sam sneaking back to get even . For all I knew , he could be circling back to the bank , upstream or down , to stalk me or lay for me . Right now , he was probably setting out there on the sand bar , thinking hard , and it was up to me to think harder . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't of had no room for if it had been daylight and me my regular self , which I was n't , being spooked and rattled and het up and chilled all together , never having had nothing to do with a corpus before except to see a few going by for funerals . I thought of hauling the body up in the sand hills and burying it where nobody 'd find it till Doomsday , if then . But that would meanp39leaving my wheelbarrow behind , maybe long enough for Sam to come wading back and burn it . Or I thought I could just nudge Frank 's mortal remains over the bank into the river , like he 'd been going to do with my flour sack , and let him see if he could make it into the Missouri . Then there would n't be no blame to lay onto me right off , it being customary in Nebraska Territory for the Law to grab whoever 's closest to trouble and hang on , just to have something to show . I did n't give much thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where there was probably a marshal or a general or somebody . That was four days off  --  or more , with all that extra load  --  and a corpus would n't be good company even in cool weather , not to mention the dark of the night . It was a mean problem , and while I tried to figure it through , I got my kit tied back together best I could , including the skillet and the blanket , which had got a hole burnt in it somewhere along the line , because one thing was certain : I was n't going to stay at the same campsite tonight and make it easier for Sam if he took it into his head to find out whether I could tell one end of his gun from the other . I was moving on , and the sooner the better so 's he 'd have less chance to bushwhack me up ahead , though there was n't no bushes to whack out of . And I come to the conclusion I could n't do everything right in a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the least wrongs in it : I just left the body laying there and everything like it was , come what may . What was the sense in being innocent if you was n't going to act like it ? I had n't shoved my wheelbarrow more'n fifty yards , going cautiousand quiet and peeling my eye for any sign of movement high or low , land or water , when I come to the next part of my problem . I 'd half-wondered where Sam and Frank 's packs had got to and whether they was afoot , and there ahead of me I could just barely make out the answer standing low-headed and humpbacked and not much bigger than some of the jackrabbits I 'd heard tell about : it was a burro , and when I wheeled close enough to make sure I was n't seeing things , it backed around to aim its kicking end at me . I give it a little soft talking to , and it settled down some so 's I could get around front and let it smell me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for miles to tether it to , and it had a pack tree hitched on its back and a full canvas-covered load . It was as skinny as Biltmore , and I could feel its ribs sticking out.  |p40And  so I had to start thinking again . My mind was getting as much exercise as my arms and back , and it felt about as sore , but I managed to dredge up a couple of notions : if Sam stayed scairt off , this burro was going to starve , which it was halfway to doing right now , and hobbled like that , it could n't even drink too good , the riverbank being a couple feet high in most places , so I was going to have to untie it . It crossed my thoughts to do what Sam and Frank had been about to do with me : run off with somebody else 's food and kit . But then I got to thinking it might make Sam worse than he already was . He 'd already kilt his own pardner , and I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no thief anyway , spite of that revolver stuck in my belt , which I meant to get rid of soon as I 'd got well off from Sam . I untied that hobble , and the second the knot come loose , the burro trotted off into the night . Seemed like it was heading up for the sand hills , where it could maybe find some kind of food on the far side , scrub or dead grass . I worried after it for a bit , thinking Sam was going to have a hell of a time catching up with his belongings , but then I figured he could track it by daylight , and I 'd a whole lot rather he 'd be looking for a burro than looking for me . We was all three going to be in for a busy while , but at least me and the burro had one advantage : we knew where we was headed and why and we had n't kilt nobody and was n't shivering wet out in the middle of the Platte on a moonless March night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to move to keep warm but going slow because I could n't see ruts , humps , or bogs . I pulled the wheelbarrow instead of pushing in the dark : it was easier to pick myself up than it , so I went first to get the lay of the ground , crossing six or seven more of them long , narrow , shallow ditches like the one I 'd camped by . I could n't figure out what they was for but to stumble into , though I 'd been grateful to lay down in that other one . Long before sunup , I knew the burro was following me . I 'd had to keep a check on all directions , expecting Sam to pop up out of the ground any minute like a prairie dog , and when the sky first begun to pale a little , I seen the burro about a hundred yards back , stopping when I stopped , going when I went , and keeping his distance . He still had the pack tree on , but whether he 'd found some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't feel any too happyp41about him trailing after because what with my big feet and the wheelbarrow and now his hooves , Sam would n't have but one directionto pick along a track anybody could see . When I come to a few scraps of driftwood on the near shore which I would n't have to get wet collecting , I called a halt and made a small fire ( it was light enough now so 's I felt pretty safe ) , and cooked some breakfast . The burro kept back and had a drink of water , pretending not to watch me . And I was chawing the last of my fried dough and starting to settle back and think up ways to squeeze the gold out of the river and maybe even catnapping , when I snapped wide awake and realized I was seeing a man coming after me along the road . First , I thought it was Frank come back from the dead because he was wearing the same kind of clothes , but this one did n't have no hat on and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had n't got too good a look at Sam before , but I reckoned I was going to get one now . The burro did n't even let him get close but trotted off south toward the valley rim , putting on a little extra speed when Sam made a short run at him . I pulled out the gun and looked it over , not knowingmuch what I was looking at but seeing the two bullets left in it . I got up , held it in both hands , and stood my ground . Sam quit burro chasing after a couple of zigzags , acting like a tired man who 'd just as soon lay down as anything else , walking duck-footed and hunched forward . He come at me slower and slower and stopped about twenty yards off , breathing hard with his mouth open . He had a big fat face and a belly to match and did n't look like he 'd been enjoying hisself lately except at suppertime . The burro had quit moving and took up a good spot about fifty yards off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 're doing ? " he says . " Pikes Peak or Bust , " I says . " You think you can get away with robbing me ? " he says . " Kid like you ? " " I 'm not robbing nobody of nothing , " I says . " Whose burro you think that is ? " he says , scowling . " Take him and welcome , " I says . " He 's none of mine . " Sam scowled some more , and I could tell he was sizing up the gun . " And how did he happen to get loose of his hobble ? "  | " Same way he 's going to get caught now , I reckon : by the friendly hand of man , " I says . " You took Frank 's money , and I 'm going to get it back if I have to make you eat that there gun , " he says . " You think I 'd let you run off with what we spent months of slaving to scrape up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I says . " Do n't make me laugh , I got a set of sore ribs , " he says , coming a few steps closer . " You better give me that gun before you hurt your-self . " " You 're not going to shoot me like you shot him , " I says , aiming at him but hoping I would n't have to pull the trigger . " Just stay put . " He says , " I did n't shoot Frank . You done it . " Well , that was a new one on me , but I could see he did n't believe it his own self . " I just shot up in the air , " I says . " That 's your say-so . I 'll say you shot him . " " What was I doing with your gun ? " I says . " Same thing you 're doing now , " he says , looking like he was straining to think . " No , was n't my gun did it . You had one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fight . " " I wish you health , long life , and happiness telling that story , " I says . He took a couple more steps but stopped when I squinted along the barrel at him . " Just give me Frank 's money , and we 'll call it quits , " he says . " Go on about your business , " I says . " All right , I 'll settle for half , same as if we was pardners . " He brushed his lanky hair back , nervous , and showed me how empty his hands was . " I do n't rob nobody , dead or alive , " I says . He give me a long , hurt look like I was telling him something downright painful . " His pocketbook was gone . I looked . " " It must of fell out , what with all that thrashing around , " I says . " You must of missed it in the dark . " He give me another long stare , looking sick and trembly-chinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was reach down and  --  " " If you could n't even find your own hat on the ground , you could of missed a pocketbook too , " I says . He run his fingers through his hair again . " My hat fell in the river . " " I beg to differ , " I says.  |p43Now  he had that thinking-hard look on his face again and was n't enjoying it none . " Maybe you 're just dumb enough , " he says , soft and puzzled . " First man along that road after dawn can pick hisself up a nice pocketbook free of charge , " I says . " How much was in it ? " He stood there , blank-eyed , seeing some no-account stranger pickingup that smoky , half-baked pocketbook and counting out whateverit was . He says , " Enough , " and took a couple more steps towards me . But I straightened my aim and says , " Watch it , mister . " He stopped . " If you had enough , what did you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on use that anchor and banjo you got tied to that wheelbarrow , and you 'll find out , " he says . " Go dig up a little gold , and then see what 's enough . See if maybe you do n't want a little more and a little more . " " Reckon I 'll find out , " I says . " I got to have some grub to get back there , " he says . " Run on your fat for a spell , " I says . " You 'll get no grub of mine . " " Then lend me the gun a minute so 's I can shoot that burro and get my bedroll and some jerky , " be says . " No , sir . " " Then shoot him for me . " " I do n't believe in shooting nothing , except you , " I says . " If I have to . " " Then lend me that rope you got in your kit , and lasso the miserablelittle pigeon-toed stump-sucker , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not about to watch it go trailing off up into them sand hills and you chasing the bitter end , " I says . " Goddamn it , " he says , adding it all up . " Tell me , " I says . " Just as a matter of common , ordinary interest : is Frank floating downstream now ? " And I seen by the flush in his forehead and the quick glance he give me I 'd guessed right . " How many miles do you reckon he 'll make a day ? " He backed off a little now , which was a step in the right direction , and he says , " That pocketbook better be there . " He sounded in earnest . " It had better be there waiting for me . Full . Or I 'll track you down and have your tripes out for sausage . " I kept the gun steady , though it was getting to feel heavy , and says , " You sure he did n't move it to some different pocket ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him good before you rolled him in ? " His eyes flickered with doubt and worry , but he kept backing off . " If you value that stupid green-assed life of yours , you better be telling the truth , " he says . " I always tell the truth if I can locate it , " I says , which was near true but boastful , and I watched him trying to stalk the burro again , which kept shying off , going just as slow or fast as Sam and acting fresher and stronger and maybe smarter . While they was playing that game , I renched off my skillet and broke camp fast , belting the gun and getting my wheelbarrow moving west again . By the time Sam had give up and noticed what I was doing , I was a hundred yards off and going brisk , and the burro was circling off south of us both , his pack tree waggling . Sam yelled something at me , to which I paid no mind , and the next time I glanced back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other campsite to do some prospecting for pocketbooks , and I wished him neither well nor ill at it , feeling sure he was going to get about what he deserved  --  ifnot now , then later , starting off with one of them Mexican breakfasts I already told you about.  |p45Most  of that day I kept wheelborrowing , though I felt like I was sleeping standing up , and the burro commenced following me again , maybe since he could n't think up nothing better to do . I tried to get close to him once or twice , but Sam had stirred up his juice on that score , and he would n't let me near . So I just kept hauling and shoving along the flats , next to the two-mile-wide , shallow , swift , dirty-looking river which had already been where I was going and seen what I wanted to see and maybe right now was rushing off east and south with more gold in it than all the landlords of creation had ever squeezed out of the mountains by theirselves . I camped well before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell asleep before dark , trying to keep one eye open in case of more trouble . But you ca n't catch two nights ' sleep with only one eye , so pretty soon I lost track of what I was doing and dozed off deep . First time I jerked awake in the middle of the night , I seen a fire way downstream of me , no telling how far but like a campfire . Then I seen a couple more on the other side of the river , then three more up ahead on my side , and I reckoned I had more company than I 'd figured on , heading for Fort Kearny . They felt like a comfort , evenp46though I did n't know whose they might be , more comfort than Sam 's revolver , which I stuck down the side of my wheelbarrow ( since I did n't want it inside my blanket with me where it might take a notionto go off ) . And I sank deeper than before and practiced panninggold in my sleep . The burro was n't nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp feeling sort of disappointed . But after I 'd been hauling about an hour , I seen it off south of me , ambling down along the gradual slope from the sand hills , aiming to catch up with me at an angle . It slipped in about twenty yards in back and come along like it was part of a pack train . It had had that tree on its back at least two nights now , and I was surprised it had n't bucked and kicked it off , but there was n't nothing I could do to keep it from getting galled , since it still would n't let me close enough to touch it , let alone unhitch it . The day was cloudy and sharp-cool , and after I 'd passed a couple of fair-sized campsites where the night fires had probably been , I kept finding wagon tracks in the boggier dips and reckoned some better-traveled side trail had joined up with the main road . I felt safer with company , but I begun to wonder how many people was headed for Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether my brother 's pardners had staked their claim good and proper and solid . It made me hurry up my wheelborrowing , since I did n't want to be left back on the runt 's tit of Fortune . Yet all day long I did n't catch up with nobody , and nobody caught up with me , so we must of all been in the same hurry , whether afoot or horseback or rolling on four wheels . I did n't see no marvels or upside-down cities , and I begun to get mad at all this distance . Every step I took I was going to have to take back someday , if I was planning on seeing Millie Slaughter again , so every step was like two steps  --  one now and one later  --  and that made it double hard except when I could shut off my mind 's eye and keep my dauber up with sheer stubbornness ( which run in our family the way red hair done in others ) . The burro was following closer all the time now , and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as me and hung around a bit ( still out of reach , though ) and did n't take off to forage on the other side of the hills till it was near dark . He seemed to like my company but only in mild doses . I did n't try to catch up with nobody , and the fires looked to bep47about the same distance off each way that night . The wind come up long before dawn , blowing dry but hard , and I laid there in the little shelter the wheelbarrow could give me , listening to it whistle through the iron spokes of my front wheel . I did n't hear no mercy in it nor smell no perfume , and I flickered in and out of sleep all night like a coal-oil lamp with a cracked chimbley . I had begun to doubt , and I was n't even near halfway to the gold fields . In the morning the burro was still gone , but I had been joined by three visitors , heaped up and tangled with each other on the windy side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all winter-bleached and knocked seedless by rolling buttover-branchesfor many a mile . The wind was still going at it , and I was the only thing in their way for as far as I could see . Shivering and wondering how I was going to get a fire lit in all this ruction , I held one by the broke-off stem and felt it shivering even harder than me , like a horse or dog about to be turned loose to get at something it wanted bad . I let go , and that weed went sailing and tumbling east next to the river , doing what it was built to do and gradually knocking itself to pieces meanwhile . I done the same with the other two , giving them their freedom and watching them flop off , maybe to get caught by the next Pikes Peaker or maybe veer enough north to hit the water and try their hand at floating like Frank 's corpus . Or by tomorrow the wind might be blowing some other way , and they 'd be scrambling with it just as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for good and all . The wind had them all going one way at the same time , and they acted like it was the best idea they ever heard of . I had to buck that wind when I got going , and it made me keep my head down most of the time , so I did n't see the burro come back till he had fell into line again behind me , only ten yards off now , which was the closest he 'd come . He was an undersized blue-roan jack with that stubborn-shy-patient look they all got , which they must of learnt from all the fool things men expect them to do . " You finding something to eat ? " I says . And then answered my own question , " Must be . " He did n't seem tired or broke down , and I begun to wonder what was in them packs out of my reach . I could see the two bedrolls tied on towards the back , but Sam had men/tioned jerky ( which I would of admired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe there was other vittles too . After five miles or so , I stopped , and he stopped , and while I set down between my handles with my back up against the tub to rest it , I says , " Mr. Blue Roan Jack , what you carrying on that pack tree ? " He switched one ear back to make sure nothing was sneaking up on him and left one aiming forward at my voice , which he had n't heard much of . " Mr. Blue , I 'd be glad to relieve you of some of that weight , in case you 're wasting your time hauling trash , but you 'd have to let me look . " He had his eyes half-slitted against the wind , which give him a shrewd , sleepy , horse-trading kind of look , and I says , " Your back 's going to be raw if you do n't leave me take that load off sometime . " I stood up slow and casual , holding my hands out so 's he could see I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a couple of small steps while talking soft , " Mr. Blue , we got to have equal shares in this company which you joined up with , free choice , and what 's mine is yours and what 's yours  --  " And that was about when he shied off his regulation twenty yards again and looked ready to make it fifty if I did n't get back to business and mind my duties , which consisted solely of leading the way . So I give up and commenced wheelborrowing while he fell in behind again , putting them dainty hooves down , one right on a line behind the other , so 's he could of walked a narrow plank over a canyon and not fell off . Then I seen a lone tepee up ahead , which I had thought a half mile off was a wrecked wagon or a heap of wind-blown trash snagged on a tree ( if there 'd been a tree along there ) but now made out as loosely sewed and half-ripped hides stretched over lashedtogetherten-foot poles . I thought of circling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I could n't see no other tracks leaving the road , so the wagons ahead of me had just went on by with no trouble , and maybe I could too . Somebody was setting out front of it near the flap and out of the wind , with a little fire going and heaps of stuff laying around . It was a messy-looking wickiup , and being all by itself like that , it looked even worse because there was n't no competition nearby to let your eye stray off on . Mr. Blue had pulled up to ten yards in back of me again , andp49when I got a good look at the man setting by the fire , I speeded up our train a little because he did n't look like nobody to spend the time of day with . He was wearing what had been a coonskin cap once upon a time but had shed most of its fur , including the tail , which hung down bare like a muskrat 's , and his face looked to be about in the same condition : patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on a smoky-dark , greasy buckskin jacket and ripped jeans and dirty deerskin wrapped around each foot like some kind of bandages , and I could see tin cans and bottles sticking out from under a couple of moth-chewed buffalo robes on the ground . I was aiming on getting by with no more'n a grunt and a nod , but he reared up when I come by and spread his long , skinny arms and let out a big , raw , gravelly voice past a full set of glistening brown teeth and says , " Welcome to the Hotchkiss Trading Post , goods for sale or barter , last opportunity till Dogtown , thirty-five statute miles , or Fort Kearny , forty statute miles , and you 'll never find a man more willing to listen to reason . " " I got nothing to reason about , " I says , slowing down in spite of wanting to hurry up because I did n't like to be rude . " You never know when you might strike the bargain of your life , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more'n gold always looks like gold . " He 'd caught my interest with that , and I set my handles down . I seen a fat , coppery-brown , blank-faced squaw peeking around the edge of the flap , and I figured I must be looking at one of them squaw men Pa had always sneered over , which he done whenever somebody had done something he had n't . " What does it look like ? " I says , thinking of the river maybe full of it a hundred yards off . " Why , it can look like me , " he says . " Or it can look like that pretty little beast you got there . Or it can look like that home-built wheelborrowwhich I congratulate you for . Or  --  " His eyes , which was n't nothing but a couple of deep black spots under his thick eyebrows , was roving all over me and mine , missing nothing they could help . " Or that Allen revolver I see sticking up out of the tub . There 's some things worth their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at and when . Opportunity and gold can both look like dirt to men of little vision . " Which sounded like something I might of thought up myself , andp50I begun looking at him a bit more kindly . " Well , I 'm always on the lookout for a chance , " I says . " A man after my own heart , " he says , showing me where that article was located by giving it a good scratch . " Avery Hotchkiss , proprietor . " " Ike Bender . " " Mr. Bender , I wo n't munch words , " he says . " You 're on your way to the gold fields , am I right ? " He squinted at me like he had just guessed my age , place of birth , and grandma 's maiden name . " Yes , sir , " I says . " And I see you have a good-sized bundle of supplies to aid and abet your future endeavors along the way and once you get there , " he says . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's true , you are the first spiritually serene man to pass along this road , in either direction , in a year and a half , " he says . " And I want to congratulate you . " " Much obliged , " I says , tipping my hat . " What color is gold ? " " Well , it might be brown and it might be gray and it might be green and it might be crystal clear , " he says . " Depends on what you fancy . " I was n't making much sense out of this , so I heisted my handles and started off . I 'd heard Pa say all squaw men was loco , and maybe he was right for once . " Just a minute , hold on there , " Hotchkiss says . " How long have you been traveling ? " " About a week , " I says , setting the handles down again because there was something urgent in his voice . " No matter how careful your preparations may have been , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be feeling the lack of something by now , " he says . " Name it . You just name it . " " I 'm getting a little tired of eating bacon and bread , " I says . " There , what did I tell you ? " he says , glancing around as if a whole bunch was listening to him , though there was only Mr. Blue aimingone ear at him . " I 've got canned raspberries . " He went diggingunder the nearest buffalo robe and come up with a round can , bulgy top and bottom , and a flat can with part of a label still stuck on it , bulgy too . " And sardines ! " he says . " Right fresh out of the ocean . " " What ocean ? " I says.  | " Sardines do n't stay in any particular ocean , " he says . " They move around , same as you and me . " " I do n't have no money to spend at all , " I says . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ever hear of trade and barter ? " he says . " You do n't need money with Avery Hotchkiss , long as you 've got anything of value . And you obviously have some articles of value . " I looked back at Mr. Blue . " That burro do n't rightly belong to me , " I says . " He just taken it into his head to tag along . " Hotchkiss stuck the cans back , give his cap a twist , and stood looking at me , ducking his knees and grinning . " I 'm glad to hear you say that , Mr. Bender , " he says . " I perceive I am in the presence of an honest man , and I believe I 'll offer you a little Taos lightning on the strength of it . " He shoved another hunk of buffalo robe off a keg laying on its side with a wooden spigot stuck into it . " Would you do me the honor ? " " I do n't believe so , " I says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one hand . " Did you think I 'd been chewing jimson weed when I spoke of crystal-clear gold ? There it lies , kegged and cool , normally available to all corners at two-bits a mouthful , but offered to you free of charge because , Mr. Bender "  --  he held up his hand again when he seen me shaking my head and reaching for the handles  --  " because I saw that burro and pack go by here three days ago . Heading the other way . And I 'd been entertaining doubts about your bona. fides till you spoke up and said it was n't yours . " " I do n't know whether I 'm bonafied or not , " I says , " but I got to get moving , and I do n't want nothing to drink , thanks . " " But we have n't completed our transaction yet , " he says . " I do n't know what that sposed to be , " I says , pretending I knew what he meant but only knowing it had something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure because I do n't know yet what you want most , " he says . " Soon as I know , we can get down to business . " " What I want most is to get to the gold fields , " I says . " And so the problem is how can we speed you on your way safe and sound and whistling a merry tune ? " he says . " Would fifteen minuteswith a nice plump warm squaw be of any interest to you ? " " I am safe and sound right now , " I says . " And I learnt how to whistle years ago . " " How are you fixed for shoe leather ? "  | " Still plenty between me and the road , " I says , but then I thought of the one thing I did need , though it did n't seem likely he 'd have none . " You would n't be trading for any quicksilver , would you ? " " You mean you 've got some ? " he says , his eyes popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could sure use some , " I says . " If I knew how to use it . " " Sure I 've got some , " he says , hearty and offhand and making me doubt it . " Got a pound and a half . Worth triple its weight in the gold it will surely find for the lucky man that 's got it in his kit . " " Well , I do n't have nothing to give for it anyway , " I says . " If that Allen revolver 's in working order , son , you and me can work a deal right here and now , " he says . So there I was , stuck with a genuine temptation . You might say I 'd won that gun in honorable combat , and if it was mine to sling in the river ( which I had still been going to do ) it was mine to barter off . But I did n't feel like that . It had kilt a man , maybe more'n one , and that made it seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I traded something for it , maybe it would turn out quicksilverwith a hex on it  --  if Hotchkiss had any . Besides , I 'd never seen no quicksilver before , and how would I know if his had gone staleor rotten or something ? " Do you mind if I inspect it ? " he says . " It is n't rightly mine neither , " I says , feeling fidgety and bothered and not having nobody to get advice from but myself . " Your honesty does you eternal credit , " he says , coming over toI'f my wheelbarrow on a knock-kneed limp , trailing them deerskin swaddles on his feet , and he plucked the revolver out from the edge of my oilskin before I could make up my mind whether to let him . He turned the chamber a couple of clicks and backed off , looking through it and hefting it and grinning some more to show all them teeth that looked like they 'd been boiled in coffee a couple of months . " Two cartridges , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Unless there 's some in the burro 's pack . " " Do n't you know ? " he says . " Have n't you looked ? " " Ca n't do much looking from ten yards off , " I says , " which is about how far Mr. Blue likes folks to be . " " I tell you something else that happened to me three days ago , " he says . " I was held up and robbed by two men , name of Art and Willy , and they had that burro and they used this revolver , and they took all my hard-earned winter cash and tobacco . "  | " They was Sam and Frank when I met up with them , " I says , startingto worry about where that gun was pointing . Hotchkiss moved off from his goods to get partway upwind of me so 's he would n't have to squint so much , and he says , " If they were the same men  --  and I do n't doubt it  --  they were remarkably generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their worldly goods . " " Well , they did n't exactly hand them over , " I says . " I see , " he says . " They did n't happen to hand over their money  --  my money  --  at the same time , did they ? " " No , sir , they did n't , " I says , wishing I was in the guardhouse or whatever they use for safekeeping in Fort Kearny . " As part of our transaction , would you be so kind as to unhitch that burro 's pack and spread it out on the ground where I can see it ? " " Mr. Blue wo n't stand still to be unhitched , " I says . " I already tried . " For a long minute Hotchkiss looked back and forth between me and Mr. Blue and back at his tepee and give hisself a scratch here and there with his extra hand , making up his mind , and then he says , " Suppose you try again . " I was agreeable , since I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine to show what Mr. Blue could do in the way of shying off , and when he 'd skipped sideways and trotted twenty yards with his stubby tail switching , I held still just in time to hear Hotchkiss say , " Hold it , do n't spook him , " then fall to cussing under his breath and gnawing a piece of his mustache . " I 'd ride him down on my horse and bulldog him , same as I would have done with those two thieves , but they kilt my horse , Mr. Bender . With this gun . " " I 'm real sorry to hear it , " I says , wondering if I could just pick up my handles and start off , but that gun was moving around in my direction , so I bided my time . " If it 's any comfort to you , you can keep the gun . " He give me a curious , crooked , one-eyed look and says , " Your generosity does you credit , Mr. Bender , but I 'll confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out a quick one-sided grin . " A man can go far by making a virtue of necessity . " " What I want to do is make time on the road , " I says . " And if you want some more comfort , one of them two men is dead . " He looked surprised . " You 're resourceful beyond your years . Butp54I 'm not vengeful . I just want my money . " He wagged the gun barrel at me like he was shooing a chicken . " Suppose you back off about five steps . " I stood there a little bit , thinking about it , then finally done what he asked . He come up to my wheelbarrow , which was between us now , and begun rummaging under my oilskin with one hand , his eyes moving from it to me and over to Mr. Blue , who 'd come back a ways . His dirty hand was pawing over my bacon and into my flour sack , searching like I once seen a blind man do hunting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , he looked square at me and says , " I want your hat off , your jacket off , your shirt off , your boots off , and your pockets empty right there on the ground . Or you can save all that bother and just hand it over . " And there I was again . Seemed like everybody on earth wanted to see the inside of my pockets where I did n't have nothing at all now but five dollars and some string and a lucky stone out of the Slaughters ' yard , not even Kit 's letter no more . I says , " Mr. Hotchkiss , I do n't have nothing of yours and hardly nothing of mine . I do n't believe I 'd care to do what you say . " " I 'll shoot you , boy , " he says , sounding like he 'd never tried nothing like that before but might . " No man 's that big a fool , " I says , hoping it was true . " I got my pride too ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glancing at Mr. Blue , who was about fifteen yards off , ears pricked up and wary . Then quieter he says , " It 's possible you may be telling the truth , boy , so I tell you what I 'm going to do : I 'm goingto cripple that burro first and see what 's in the pack , and then if we 're both lucky and my money 's there , you can just go haul yourselfoff west and forget about it . I wo n't tell anybody you kilt a man in cold blood and run off with his burro and belongings . " That was too much to swaller all at once , and I stood there trying to gulp it all down and reckon out my place in this crazy scheme , when I seen him aiming the gun at Mr. Blue with both hands and trying to stalk him a little closer . Hotchkiss kept glancing sideways at me and then having to line up his aim again , and Mr. Blue turningrestless , the way he usually done when somebody was shorteningup on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first jumping desperate step to land on Hotchkiss as the gun went off , making an even biggerslamming thump than I remembered , and I seen both Hotch/kiss 's arms go rearing up with the recoil and Mr. Blue rearing up even higher , with a dark splotch showing up on one side of his pack , and then Mr. Blue took off running and Hotchkiss took off running after him , aiming again , and I took off after Hotchkiss , stepping on one of his deerskin swaddles trailing along behind and sending him sprawling flat and skidding on his face while the gun went skidding on even further . I run right over him without stopping and got the gun before he could and turned it on him , at the same time watching Mr. Blue head for the hills at full trot , which he done in a straight line without a limp or a wobble . Not wanting to have no more to do with this Hotchkiss , I left him lay where he was , cussing and breathing short and glaring at me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time with poor folks trying to rob poor folks . All the salt and vinegar had went out of him when I looked back : he was braced up on one arm , looking like a tired old man . I belted the gun , tipped my hat to the squaw , who was peeking out of the flap to see what had went wrong this time , and started on my way again , neither sadder nor wiser nor happier nor dumber , but mystified.  |p56I  passed three covered wagons that day , two stopped for axle fixing and one getting ready to camp for the night , all three headed my way , but I kept my distance and did n't no more ' n nod like you might do at somebody you seen every day around home . And when I made my own camp , I found me a place off the road and right down next to the river where another of them ditches come down from the sand hills into the water . This one was even more trompled-looking than most , and I reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink , though I had n't seen none . I wanted to keep clear of people . I figured I could keep liking them and maybe even keep a charitable thought in my head if I was n't running up against them all the time . Mr. Blue showed up just before dark and had hisself a good long drink , sucking up that gold-looking water with his lips stuck out forward the way burros do , and he did n't seem bothered none by another lively day on the road . The bullet did n't look like it had bothered him none but had maybe hit a can of raspberries Frank and Sam had stole off Hotchkiss or a jar of preserves they 'd been saving up for company . While I made my grub , I says , " Mr. Blue , the trouble with you isp57somebody went and put pockets on you , and now everybody wants to see what 's in them . Everybody wants to know what 's in mine too , so I know just how you feel . Take my advice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets . I 'd be glad to help take that old rugged cross off your back if you 'd let me , but you think I 'm just like the rest , and you 're right : I want to see what 's in your pockets too . Now ai n't that a dirty pity ? " He did n't say nothing but a snort or two over another drink and then set hisself about ten yards off , which seemed about what he liked for nighttime , and I scattered my fire before dark , since I did n't have enough wood to keep it banked all night and did n't want my camp showing so 's people would find me when I was n't looking and give me warnings or hold me up or cuss me out or try to trade me something or tell me to strip off or blame me for a dead man . But I 'll be blamed if one of them did n't find me , just when I 'd got myself all rolled up good in my blanket and little hollows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard Mr. Blue shift off and then somebody scuffing up , and I just had time to struggle my arms outside the blanket and get my hand on the gun when this clean-shaved , skinny , pale-looking man about thirty carrying a lanternand wearing a round felt hat pulled down to his ears and eyebrows come trooping along and says , " Oh , I 'm sorry , I did n't know you were asleep . " He put the lantern on the ground between us and hunkered over it like it was a campfire and says , " You passed our wagon back about a mile , and my cousin and I saw you turn off , and then we saw your burro come out of the hills all by itself , and I just wondered . " " Wondered what ? " I says , not feeling too friendly . " Have you trained him to forage for himself ? We 're getting awful short of hay and grain for our oxen , and I hear tell there 's none to be had at Fort Kearny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some grazing . " " You 'll have to ask the burro , " I says , and we both took a look at him out there at the edge of the light . " He takes care of hisself . For all I know , the grass is six foot tall on the other side of them hills . " " I see . Well , I just thought I 'd ask . " He stared down into his lantern , looking solemn . And I felt kind of sorry for him because I could see he was trying to figure out what to do when their oxen would n't go no more . Ip58says , " If I was you , I 'd start sawing my wagon down to handcart size . He shook his head over that and smiled like it was a good joke . " I do n't believe it 'll come to that , " he says . " The Lord will provide . " " The Lord will provide grass in about two months , " I says . " Have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I says . " From Sin and Temptation and Death , " he says . " I ai n't even been earned yet , let alone saved , " I says . " But I been luckier than some others I could name the last few days , and if it was the Lord 's doing , you tell Him I 'm much obliged . " " I see you are a young man full of pride , " he says kind of sourfaced , standing up . " I would advise you to read this pamphlet . " And he took a folder out of his hip pocket and handed it at me . " You better feed that to them oxen you brung out here into the wilderness where any fool would know there was n't enough to eat , " I says . He pulled the pamphlet back and says , " The Lord looks after all creatures great and small if they believe in Him . If they humble themselves . " " I 've also heard helping your own self spoke highly of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another Sin . " I will leave you in the dark where you belong , " he says , picking up his lantern and walking off , huffy and stiff and spooking Mr. Blue out in a thirty-yard half-circle . I watched his lantern bob and swing far off , and I laid down again , scowling and uneasy and provoked and cold , and I wondered , Could he be right , and I was in the dark , and off on some plain fool 's errand ? Five hundred miles was a long stretch to be a fool in , a long ways to go Following in Satan 's Footsteps and all the rest of what they called it . Was I just off on a selfish hunt for gold ? What did I want gold for anyway ? I had told Millie Slaughter I was different than everybody else in the whole world , but was I ? Maybe I was just one of this herd , which was starting to thicken up now , headed off into the unknown mountains because they could n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wife or the weather or their own selfs had made them so miserable , they was ready to walk or ride till they dropped , just to keep their head full of something new . I laid there , thrashing around and vexing myself and heavingp59sighs and making more noise than the river and probably making Mr. Blue wish he 'd stayed up in the hills where he did n't have to listen to nothing but coyotes and wolves . But then I come to my senses : I smelt the wind and heard the water and remembered where they was both coming from  --  out of the west , where everything was thick with strangeness and ripe with adventure and not all slab-sided and mucked over and figured out . And I felt the sand under my fingers , just plain sand , and it did n't matter whether it was gold or not , it was good enough for me because it was fresh territory and so was I. I begun to feel like I was my own campfire laying there , and I did n't need no stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning neither . All in a rush I felt like a happy man . Maybe I had been saved , and if I 'd had me a lantern , I might of hiked over to that feller 's wagon and told him so and his cousin too . Because this is what I felt like ( and it do n't look like much when it 's wrote down ) : I felt like I'mHere , Right Here on This Spot of Earth , and I Claim This Worthless Spot for as Long as I Can Remember It . It felt like another wonder , come just in time , and I fell asleep right on top of it . I dreamt of thunder , and then I dreamt of the earth shaking , and then I dreamt Mr. Blue was braying out a long hee-haw , the first of his I 'd heard , the wild cry of what they call the prairie nightingale , and when I woke up , he was still doing it , and the buffaloes was commencing to thunder by . There they come , humpety-thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spread out in the dawn up in the sand hills but narrowing down to single file , the lead bull just lumbering past me when my eyes blinked open probably as red as his . I must not of looked like much to worry about under my blanket because they went right by , looking huge and dark and shaggy , and went splashing straight into the river and going right on out into it , on and on , through shallows , swimming a sink hole , shelving up across a little island , and I did n't know which way to look nor what to do , so I just kept still , jolting up and down , and felt thankful they kept to their ditch . I do n't know where they was going , but they sure intended to get there . I could n't stretch around to see how Mr. Blue was feeling about all this , but he must of felt like me : whatever them buffaloes wanted to do , they was welcome to do it , and all I asked was leavep60to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was big , and they all run sort of tip-tilty front to back like a hobbyhorse , their tails stuck out and some tongues too , and a lot of them letting manure fly as they went , so there was grass or brush growing somewhere . Maybe two or three hundred went by while I kept dead still undermy blanket , and then the last ones heaved into the chest-deep water and headed off north , and pretty soon there was no trace left but a wild stably kind of smell . They had decided to ford the Platte  --  or one had decided and the others had caught the fever  --  and they made no bones about it , not even mine , but just done it . And I was glad I had n't taken up the habit of leaving my wheelbarrow , making fire , or bedding down in them ditches . I got an early start , thanks to them , and Mr. Blue joined me calm as you please . We passed five wagons and three handcarts in the first five miles , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time the sun was up full and had took the chill off , we come to a big trail junction and the road turned more and more rutted , and I could see dozens of wagons up ahead between me and Fort Kearny . I begun to feel crowded and not so happy . When I was by myself , I could make believe I 'd used my head better than anybody else to get going in early spring , but here was all these other people that had used their head too . Whenever I 'd pass somebody , they 'd scowl at me like I was racing them to the supper table , and whenever somebody passed me  --  it happened a few times : a couple of men afoot , a man with a pair of mules and a cart full of hay  --  I 'd be trying to keep from frowning and thinking they had their stakes all sharpened - up to jump my claim on Slab Crick . Only friendly thing I seen that whole day was when a stagecoach ( which I heard somebody holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trail ) bounced and jolted by me and Mr. Blue , and half a small arm come out the side window after it was by and waved a little lacy white wipes at us . Soon after that , I passed up four men hauling a handcart , and they looked at me suspicious , like I did n't have no right to bust out of line and get someplace ahead of them , and they glanced Mr. Blue up and down with contempt , like he did n't know as much about hauling as them . I must of looked like a well-to-do , well-prepared prospector to the naked eye which could n't see Mr. Blue running offp61whenever he felt like it , and them that did n't have critters to do their hauling for them did n't take too kindly to me . In another mile I caught up with a young wheelborrower , not much older than me , shoving along with his head down and his arms looking like they 'd been stretched down as far as they 'd go and his feet goosing out sideways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which wo n't get you no place in a hurry , so I caught up with him pretty quick . His wheelbarrow could n't put a patch on mine , being an ordinary hod-carrying , slapped-up heavyweight and not designed special like the Millicent Slaughter . When he seen me , he tried to pull together and stay even , gritting his teeth and leaning his body forward like he was straining up a slope , and even though I was n't going no faster than usual , he made me feel like we was racing . When I begun to pull ahead , he says , " What 's your hurry , you goddamn clodhumper , you ? " " I always go like this , " I says , hearing him gasping and knowing he had n't practiced up the way I done . " Which one of you 's the jackass ? " he says , meaning Mr. Blue , and he tilted his wheelbarrow sideways and tried to ram me , but I was too far past . I did n't have no cause to fight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him behind , wasting his breath and not enjoying hisself or his surroundings , probably not even seeing the way the sun come waveringoff and on across the sand and getting hisself all worked up worrying about somebody else getting the best of him . I vowed then and there I was n't going to do nothing like that , but do my work and take my turn and prepare for the worst and hope for the best and manage with what come along . And the next thing that come along was Dogtown , which they call it after the prairie dogs that burrow and whistle all around there , and it was n't but five or six doby shacks and a barn for the mailwagonhorses , what they call a swing station for the stagecoach , and people was camped out all higgledy-pig south of there , which must of give the prairie dogs a bad strain on their neighborly feelings . And from there on , it was only about five miles to Fort Kearny , and only a little over a hundred more to the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred more to Julesburg , and then only about a hundred more to Slab Crick , short of Denver City , sop62all told I did n't have but three hundred miles and a couple of whoops to go . The thought put some bounce in my boots , and I hove up toward the station hut to see if I could get some friendly advice for a change about where it was all right to bed down and where to get wood . I had begun to worry about Mr. Blue , him going all day on nothing but hope and water , but he went right around back toward the barn like he 'd been there before ( and maybe he had ) , and I let him take care of hisself , since he 'd been doing a better job at it than I could of done for him . But then my whole pile of thoughts , which I 'd been heaping up all day in the bottom of my head , blew off sideways and left an empty hollow , because there by the shut door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its sod roof stood Millie Slaughter , in person , not my wheelbarrow , wearing two wool shawls and a bonnet and looking straight at me with eyes big as horse chestnuts , and she had a small , thin smile on her face that looked like she 'd been saving it up just for me . " Good afternoon , Mr. Bender , " she says . " I 've been expecting you . " Which was more'n I could say of her.  |p63I  must of seemed dumbstruck to her , and I was , because she tried to help me inside by the elbow like I was blind or crippled up , but I could n't leave my wheelbarrow to get robbed , strayed , or stolen , so I says , " How in the living world did you get here ? " She looked surprised when I would n't let her tug me indoors . " I took a steamboat down to St. Joe and caught the stagecoach , " she says , like it was plain as day what any fool would of done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe they have food to eat , but I did n't want to be unescorted . " I realized I was gaping at her , so I shut my mouth and took off my hat . " I 've been waiting out here three hours , " she says . " I expected I 'd have to wait two or three days for you in Fort Kearny . You must have been progressing very rapidly , but , Mr. Bender , you 've been neglecting to comb your hair . " Which was true , since I did n't have no comb but my fingers . " Was that you waved your wipes out the window ? " " I waved my handkerchief , " she says . " I could n't get the driver to stop , and this place seemed more convenient anyway . " " Yes , but why 'd you come all this way ? " I says , still groping top64get hold of the right handle on this problem because here she was , standing there and me facing her , and I was wide awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I expect he 's already thought up a few things , " she says . " I 've been bouncing up and down on mail sacks for a number of days , and though I did manage to get some breakfast this morning , I lost it . So would you mind escorting me inside ? " There was something firm and scairt and resolute and desperate and awful young about her , and I could reckonize what was bound and determined , being that way myself , but I says , " I think they charge money in these places . " " I have some money , Mr. Bender , or I would n't be here , " she says . And I finally had to let her tug me through the door , leaving the other Millicent Slaughter to the mercies of all kind of passerbys and maybe dogs wanting to make the acquaintance of Biltmore . She got us set down on three-legged stools at a big rough table , and we took turns breathing the greasy , smoky air while the stationmasterand a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us through the gloom ( there was two coal-oil lamps and no windows ) under the low , dirt-stained canvas ceiling , and she says , " Mr. Bender , I have run away from home . Temporarily . " Which was about what I had figured except the last part , so I says , " You mean you 're going back ? " That made me feel good because it seemed to scrape off some of the confusion . " When 's the next stagecoach ? " " No , I mean my current status is temporary , " she says , biting her lip and hesitating and not meeting my eye straight on . " I do wish they 'd serve us some food . " " I 've got bacon left out in my wheelbarrow , but I 'd have to build a fire someplace and  --  " " Waiter ! " she says , aiming at the other end of the room , and the four lunkheads seemed to like that one because they chuckled and said it over a couple times each , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with his coffee mug like he might want to borrow a little sugar , and she says , " We 'd like something to eat , please . Do you have a menu ? " He frowned at her , then looked at me , and says , " We do n't have none of that . All 's we got is slumgullion , seventy-five cents . " " Well , I suppose that will have to do , " she says . " We 'll have two slumgullions. "  | " Just one , " I says . " I 'm not  --  " " Two , " she says , and the hostler strolled off scratching the seat of his buckskin-patched blue pants . I got up to make sure my wheelbarrow was all right , and when I come back she says , " I suppose I owe you an explanation . " " I 'd be much obliged , " I says , already imagining what Tom Slaughter was going to be doing and saying . She took off her bonnet and set it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of her two shawls with two blue bows tied on the ends . " My mother left me a little money of of my own , " she says . " It 's mine to use as I see fit at any time , and I 'm mature for my years . " " How much did the boat and the stage cost ? " I says , interested to find out how much I saved by hiking . " I have some left , if that 's what you mean , " she says , nervous and a little snappy . " I just wondered because I  --  " " Mr. Bender , have you been thinking of me at all ? " she says , suddenlygetting her eyes right on me and through me and her face going hopeful and hopeless , both . I remembered many a night  --  and daytime too  --  when she 'd been on my mind or around it or under it . " Well , yes , " I says . " And I 've been thinking about you too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read too many stories in which young men go off to seek their fortunes , leaving their  --  their ladies behind to wait and  --  and pine for them . Those stories mostly have happy endings , but they take too long in coming . " " I ca n't help it if Slab Crick 's five hundred miles from home , " I says . " I did n't put it there . " " I 'm not blaming you , " she says . " Just  --  life . Those young men in the stories spend a great deal of their time helping damsels in distress . " " I have n't seen one single solitary  --  " "  --  helping damsels in distress and sometimes being won by them , " she says . " So I decided I could n't wait , but would go along and if need be I 'd be your damsel in distress . Do n't you see : you would n't have to hunt for any . " " Well , I 've had some distress already , but there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running around and running ahead of my tongue , up hill and down , both hunting and hiding.  |p66The  hostler come over and slapped down two tin plates full of something or other thinner than Platte River water , but she spooned right into hers without looking at it , not taking her big dark eyes off mine , and between swallers she says , " I do n't fancy staying home spinning and being Pa 's daughter and sewing and looking out the window for years . Would you ? " " Well , I  --  " " I want to seek my fortune too , " she says , earnest and full of a strange , drawn-out sundown longing , the kind I had felt alone out on the trail . " I have come to believe you are my fortune , Mr. Bender , and perhaps I can be yours . " I had never had no chance to practice up on this kind of talk , and there was n't no time to learn , but when I tried to plunge right in , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical . " It 's more'n three hundred miles to Slab Crick , " I says . " You 're too  --  pretty , " not wanting to call her young or weak or frail and not knowinghow to tell her what was deeper down in my heart , which I had located right about where I catch my breath . " There 's Injuns and bad weather and bad men and bad food and horrible hard work , and you do n't deserve none of them . You 're too  --  dear , " which was near as I could come right then . She seemed to grip on to that last word , and she dipped away at her slumgullion , still staring at me and not wiping her chin and starting to smile . " Dear ? " she says , tasting it . " Am I really ? " I wanted to get up and check on my wheelbarrow , but it did n't seem like the right time . " Yes , " I says , not wanting to back off . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd met on the river road . " Women can get theirselves kilt out here . Or get sick and die . I 'd feel horrible if something went and happened to you . " " You would ? " she says , looking mighty pleased at the idea , and her eyes went blurry and far off . " What would you say if I were dying ? " " How should I know ? " I says . " Would you hold me in your arms ? And weep for me ? " " I would n't hold you in my arms if you had fell into some bottomlessgorge or other , " I says . " You 'd best go on home to your pa and wait . " Her mouth went so stubborn she could hardly eat with it , but she got the spoon through a couple more times , then says , " And you 'd best eat and keep your strength up . "  | " You ca n't walk three hundred miles , " I says . " You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fittin ' , you being a girl . " " I have no intention of being a sister to you , Mr. Bender , " she says with slumgullion on her chin . " I hope not , " I says . " Whose goddamn burro 's that out back ? " one of the hostlers says . " I was thinking of holy matrimony , " she says . " He tore the side out of a sack of oats and et about half of it , " the hostler says . " If I catch that goddamn  --  " He heard my stool going over and seen me standing up , and he says , " Is that your burro , boy ? If that son of a  --  " " You watch your language around this lady , " I says , " or you 'll eat the rest of them oats yourself . " I expected I 'd have to fight him , since nobody ever done nothing I told them to . But he turned all meek and smiley and ducked his head a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I forgot myself . We do n't get no women to speak of out here . " " I said a lady , not no woman . " But Millie had started eating again , out of my plate this time , and she did n't seem interested in apologies nor wiping her chin off neither and looking ladylike . The other three lunkheads was cackling and cawing at the hostler , but he backed off and shushed at them and went out the back door , and I stood there feeling strong till I remembered what she 'd said . " Holy what ? " I says . " I did n't know you had taken to carrying firearms , " she says with her mouth half full . And sure enough , the butt of the revolver was sticking out between the front of my jacket , which must of been what tamed the hostler down . I took it out of my belt so 's I would n't shoot myself if I bumped into something , and two more of the lunkheads cleared out , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only two things wrong with you getting married , " I says , keeping my voice down . " You 're too young , and there 's nobody for you to marry . " She polished off my plate and finally used her little lace-edged wipes on her chin , then dug into a round draw-neck black purse and counted out a dollar and a half . " That waiter does n't deserve anything for his service , " she says , as stern as ever Miss Wilkerson could of said it , but she changed over to a softer voice for me . " That'sp68my trunk over there in the corner . " She nodded at a leather-bound humpbacked knee-high trunk setting on the dirt floor . " That 's a good place for it , " I says . " The stage driver wo n't have no trouble finding it when he picks you up to head back . " " Mr. Bender , I 'd like to speak to you outside , " she says . Which was fine with me , since I never felt too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out and I was grateful to see it had n't been messed with . It was getting on for dusk now , and the road looked empty both ways , and the river was more'n a mile off , shimmering in the flat light . She says , " I made thorough inquiries of the driver before he had to move on . Do you want to know what I learned ? " I could tell I was in for some unwelcome information , but there was n't nothing I could do but nod . " The next stagecoach is n't for six days , " she says . " You should have thought of that before you  --  " " But I would n't take it if it was to come in six minutes . Mr. Bender , do n't you care for me ? " " I 'm trying to care for you , " I says . " You ca n't take care of your-self . " That made her mad , and her mouth tightened up . " Yes , I can . " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I says . " I have a very practical suggestion on that score . " " I 'd admire to hear it . " " I aim to sleep in your arms , " she says . Miss Wilkerson , when she was teaching the both of us , claimed there was n't but Seven Wonders of the World , but she must of quit counting too soon . While I was getting the taste of that one , I seen Mr. Blue come around the far side of the doby hut with his pack tree slung around upside down and hanging under him like some fool had tied him to the top of a little wood table whose legs was shorter than his . He tried to give it a kick but could n't reach it right , and he did n't look too happy . " In my arms ? " I says , trying to imagine it and keep track of everything else at the same time . " I 'm told the commanding officer at Fort Kearny is authorized to perform marriages and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What in the world would your pa say ? " " If I were married , there 's nothing he could say . " Mr. Blue come to a squirmy halt about ten yards off , still chewing on oats ( there was some sticking out of the corner of his mouth )  |p69and  looking mighty tired of that pack tree , specially upside down . " I saw the burro from the stagecoach , but I could n't believe it was yours , " she says . " Is n't that perfect ? " " Nothing 's perfect , " I says . " Mr. Blue do n't belong to me . He 's just sort of stringing along . " " Why 's his pack on like that ? " she says , marching straight over and starting to unhitch it like she 'd seen a package with the string tied wrong . Mr. Blue did n't shift a hoof , just give her a sniff up the side of the shawls while she was at it . When the pack tree and the bundleslashed to it fell down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a colt turned loose into the spring grass , but he just stood quiet and content . " Who owns all this gear ? " she says . " Hard to say . " I did n't know which way that Sam was headed , so I could n't exactly lay claim to whatever it was . " One of the owners is dead , and the other 's off someplace . " " Well , I aim to use Mr. Blue if you do n't , " she says . " You 're going to wait for the next coach back if I have to camp here and see to it myself , " I says , but I did n't sound any too sure of it . " You ca n't come along . Please . " She was down on her knees , unwrapping Sam and Frank 's bedrollsand untying their kits and searching through everything faster than Sam had went through my wheelbarrow . " You have n't heard me out yet , Mr. Bender , " she says . " How are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Same to you , " I says . " You think it 's any easier feeding two mouths than one ? " " Somebody spilt blackberry syrup all over this blanket , " she says , and then fell to tidying and rearranging and putting a can here and a knife there and looking over a pair of spurs like they might be can openers , and I did n't feel like telling her the troubles Mr. Blue had seen . " If you happen to run across a pocketbook in there , I know who it belongs to , " I says . " That 's what I 'm trying to tell you , Mr. Bender , " she says . " I have enough money to provision us and a little more besides . I 'm offering to buy a partnership with you , which is what most dowries turn out to be anyway . Now would you please bring my trunk outside ? " I just stood there a minute , not knowing how to argue with her or which end of it to start on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull that revolver on her , and I could n't leave her tied up for six days till the coach come , so what was I sposed to do ? She frowned at me , looking around the edge of her bonnet with them big excited eyes . " Do n't just stand there , " she says . " I have to get my belongings into a reasonable pack , do n't I ? We ca n't use any of this trash except the bedrolls , which are extremely unclean . And maybe this yellow slicker . I 'll wash them out later . " It begun to look like Mr. Blue had n't had nothing much in his pockets neither , but just had n't wanted to turn them out for nobody . " I do n't like to contradict a lady , " I says . " Then do n't , " she says . " Mr. Bender , do you want those men , those miners and your brother , to welcome you with open arms when we get to Slab Creek ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what 'll they say when they see I brung a frail little girl along ? They 'll kick me out of the company and  --  " " Mr. Bender , I have five pounds of quicksilver in my trunk , " she says . " I bought it in St. Joe and paid dearly for it , and I invite you to try to find half that much anywhere in Nebraska or Kansas Terri-tory . " I brung out her trunk for her , still hoping to change her mind , but anxious to see what quicksilver looked like so 's I 'd know it if I seen it again . And running through my mind quicker than any silver was a vision of all that gold might be in the Platte , and here was Millie with five pounds of the only way to find out , and by and large I was feeling pretty fuddled with trying to think in three or four different directions , upside , west , and crooked . I felt like Mr. Blue hauling somebody else 's baggage on backwards and growling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . She unstrapped her trunk and begun shifting a dress or two and holding some things all folded tight so 's I could n't see what they was and tossing away Sam and Frank 's scraps and litter like I seen my ma at a rummage sale once over in Plattsmouth . A couple of kids had come over to watch , and I seen the hostler who 'd backed off from me in the station come to the corner of the hut and stand there scowling , mostly at Mr. Blue . " Millie , you have to understand , " I says , making my last try at separating the confusion from the bald truth . " It may seem like a game to you now , but out on the road it 's going to seem like pure Hell . " I took a couple of swallers and moved closer so 's the kids andp71the hostler could n't hear . " I 'll marry you someday , but back where I can put a roof over our head . " She stood up and faced me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at me , running her eyes all over my face and smiling slow and small . " I hope you 're not going to think me immodest , Mr. Bender , " she says . " But I 'll have to take that risk because this is the turning point of my life . I hereby pledge and promise you all the wedded bliss you can handle in this world . " She went on staring at me , and I says , " What 's that bliss ' mean ? " " It 's to your credit you do n't know , " she says . " How 's come you know ? " I says . " Women simply do know about things like that , " she says . " And I have read a number of works of fiction . " I must of been blushing then because she touched my cheek the way you touch a stove lid to see if it 's hot , and the kids commenced giggling and going " nyaah-nyaah " and wiggling around . Millie shooed them off without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll never know , but was n't the same charm working on me ? ) and then she got busy fixing her pack and getting me to heist it up on Mr. Blue , leaving off the pack tree . She used Frank and Sam 's rope to lash it on tight and neat . " This is the squaw hitch , in case you did n't know , " she says , and I did n't . " Please , now , we have to think , " I says , but my mind was spilling over with quicksilver , gold , and Bliss  --  mostly Bliss  --  and once you get Bliss on your mind , it do n't leave much room for sense . " You ! " she says at the hostler . " I need some tar or axle grease . This burro 's been rubbed raw . " The hostler scowled some more , glancing at me , and says , " He et about two dollars ' worth of my oats , " he says . " You should watch your stable more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , " she says . " You fetch me a handful of axle grease , and you can have my trunk , which cost two dollars and seventy-five cents , and the rest of this gear , and we 'll call it square . " The hostler disappeared , and she tied a short rope lead on Mr. Blue and says , " We 'd best get on to Fort Kearny . " I still could n't believe all this was happening , but here it was , coming at me item after item , one step at a time , and there did n't . seem to be no way to keep the next thing from being next . I says ,  | " It 's five miles , " half-hoping the mere sound of it might make her feet hurt . " Walking will seem like a comfort after that stagecoach , " she says . " And walking with you will seem like floating through the air , Mr. Bender . " What kind of answer can a sane and sober man make to something like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done was wipe my nose and get my hat on tight and try to keep from getting too full of myself . When the hostler come back with a handful of grease , she took it from him like it was ladies ' cold cream and slapped it on Mr. Blue and says , " There , that 's better , " and the hostler chased the kids off the heap of clothes and other gear and begun stuffing it all in the trunk . " Mind me making one suggestion ? " I says . " Not if it 's useful for our purpose , " she says , holding a little heavylookingcrock with a clamp top on it and ready to stuff it in Mr. Blue 's pack . " If that 's the quicksilver , do n't trust Mr. Blue to have it on hand when you might happen to need it , " I says . " He likes to wander off a day at a time . " She hesitated , then lifted up a corner of my oilskin and shoved the crock into my wheelbarrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , but then me leading the way into what was left of the light , past women and kids from the wagons camped out hither and yonder , most of them hunting for sticks or buffalo chips or anything that 'd burn , and us not saying much and me wondering if I could n't hunt up somebody sensible at Fort Kearny to talk us out of this.  | As it turned out , there was n't no shortage of people willing to do that , starting with the first horse soldier we run into after about a mile and a half ( which Millie done without complaint and even singing a little song about a bird in a tree though there was nary a bird come our way and no trees but a grove out on a big island in the river ) , and this soldier come riding up , stern and red in the face , and says , " Get the hell back where you belong , no foraging on GovernmentProperty , ca n't you read ? " " There was n't nothing to read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stake back there , so you can just turn right around and go back and get somebody to spell it out for you , " he says . " Git ! " Mr. Blue did n't like that kind of talk , but Millie had him firm by the rope , and I says , " If it was on a stake , it 's probably been burnt for firewood by now . " " I 'm giving you Official Notice , then , " he says . " And the next form of notice is a boot up the rear end . " " I 'm at a loss to account for this uncivilized behavior , " Millie says . The soldier give her a glance , then tipped his hat up so 's he could hear better , and says , " Do n't you understand plain English ? "  | " We both understand it a great deal better than you , I 'll wager , " she says . " And I won the only spelling bee ever conducted in Cass County , so mind your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smiling with one front tooth broke off halfway , the soldier leaned over at me and says , " You better take that little girl back home to her ma before she starts sassing somebody that ai n't full of the milk of human kindness like me . All you dang sodbusters ought to have more sense . There ai n't any gold up ahead , no more'n there is un-derfoot . " " You ever looked underfoot ? " I says . He looked , and there was n't nothing down there but hard-packed sand and a couple of horse apples . " No , " he says . " I work for a living . " " And I wish you a rapid rise in your profession , " Millie says . " But first you 'll have to learn to be more respectful . " He smiled , even though it seemed like he did n't want to , and says to me , " Take Little Sissy Backtalk off home now or you 'll get in trouble . " " I 'm not his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I want to speak with your commanding officer about conducting a wedding ceremony . We have no time to spare : it 's getting dark . " He chewed that one over , then says , " No foraging on Government Property , no livestock allowed . " " My wheelbarrow do n't eat nothing , " I says . " And this burro has just eaten his fill , " she says . " And we 're not sodbusters . And my father knows Major Kemper , and what does your name happen to be ? " The soldier did n't look too happy , and he reined his horse off to the side a ways . " All right , go on in , " he says . " But stick to the road . And if anybody asks , I 'll say I warned you and you must of doubled back . " He rode off , and I says , " Your pa do n't know any Major Kemper out here , does he ? " " No , but he might , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the two together are enough truth for the purposes of diplomacy . " So we was one step nearer , and nobody 'd stopped her yet , and my Future begun to look more and more like it was lining up with hers.  |p75We  come to Fort Kearny while there was still enough daylight left to see the few trees and the bare flagpole and the barracks buildingsaround three sides of an empty square and some doby huts and storehouses , but there was n't no fort to it like I 'd expected , no stockade or gunports or nothing , just the road turning rutted and sloggy till we had to sheer off and walk next to it to keep from gettingbogged down . After a long silence , I says , " You sure you still want to go through with this ? " " Mr. Bender , I 've been waiting to hear your arguments against it , " she says . " I already told you , " I says . " And I believe I successfully rebutted everything you said . " She held my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at her . I did n't know how to talk pretty , and still do n't , but I felt like kissingher then , and I done so . I was improving in that department , or maybe she was doing all the improving ( it 's hard to tell with kissing ) , but when we had finished for a while , I had something to say which I had n't even thought up but had come unbidden , and I never felt more surprised at anything to come out of my mouth . " I love you , " I says . " I love you too , Mr. Bender , " she says . " Our lives may be difficult and hard , but they 'll be beautiful and wonderful too , and at least bearable , which is more than I can say for a life without you . " I had never heard any music like that before , and I would of stood there a long while , holding her hands and enjoying it , but somethingnew seemed to take charge of me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major or there wo n't be no wedding night left . " " There 's always a wedding morning too , " she says . " And a weddingafternoon and evening . " But she sounded giddy and cheery and young and dizzy , and I knew exactly how she felt , being of the same persuasion myself . We finally tracked down Major Kemper after being told No three times each by a Sergeant and a Lieutenant , and he come out on his piazza ( which is what they call the long covered porch in front of his two-story wood house ) , with a napkin jammed into his collar and his jaw still giving his supper a work-over under his broad mustache , which was brown over on the cigar side and gray on the other . He listened about halfway through what the Lieutenant said  --  which was what the both of us had told and told and told so many times , it seemed like it had already happened  --  and he says , " Go get Reverend Applegate . " And while the Lieutenant went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my wheelbarrow and Mr. Blue over and says , " Well , you two have a nerve , I guess . " " We have all the nerve we require for the purpose , Major Kemper , " she says . He went on chewing a bit , then pulled his napkin out , mopped his mouth , and hollered over his shoulder , " Clara ! Come on out here a minute . " He looked Millie up and down and says , " How old are you , girl ? " " Do n't you know it is n't polite to ask a lady 's age ? " she says . " If you and your men have won any medals yet , they are undoubtedly not for gallantry . " The Major sucked his stomach in and glared at me like I was to blame for it all and says , " Do n't you know better than to take a raw girl afoot all the way from here to Denver City or wherever you 're bound ? Are you crazy ? " " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long gray dress come to the door and says , " What are you shouting for ? Do n't shout . " The Major says , " I merely wanted you to come see  --  " " Shouting my name outdoors at night across the parade ground , " she says . " As if it were some kind of order . As if you were giving me orders . " " I 'm sorry , dear , " the Major says . " I merely wanted you to lend your weight to the argument here . " He looked from me to Millie . " There 's bound to be an argument . " " What 's my weight got to do with it ? " his wife says . The Major used his napkin on his forehead and says slow and soft and reasonable , " These two very young and very foolish emigrants , who are on their own , want me to marry them . Right now . Tonight . " His wife come out on the piazza and squinted back and forth at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Them ? " she says . " Ridiculous . " " We 're no more emigrants than you are , " Millie says . " And certainlyno more ridiculous . We are full-share members of thep77Hearthstone Mining Company and are quite prepared to pay our way . What 's your usual fee for a wedding ceremony ? " Which was the first I 'd heard of any Hearthstone Mining Companybut it sounded grand . " I perform very , very few weddings , " the Major says . " And then only for my men and only if necessary . " His wife leaned close to inspect Millie and says , " How old are you , girl ? Fourteen ? Fifteen ? " She said the years like they was the worst possible ones . " I happen to be Sweet Sixteen , " Millie says , holding her chin up high . " And I had better warn you that my bridegroom-to-be is quite prepared to defend me from any slurs . " " I surely am , " I says , and I was , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant fetched up a squat little man in a black suit , and when he got in a slice of light from the doorway , I seen his red face and watery eyes . There was nothing wrong with the Major 's eyesight neither . He says , " For God 's sake , Applegate , are you drunk this early ? " " It 's not early , " Applegate says with the Lieutenant holding on to his arm . " How do you expect to exert any moral authority when you 're three sheets to the wind ? " the Major says . " And on my brandy , I might add . " " Our brandy , " his wife says , still looking at Millie , disapproving and giving little shakes to her head . " Are you a man of the cloth ? " Millie says . Blinking so 's he could get her lined up straight , Applegate says , " Yes . " " How much do you charge to conduct a wedding ceremony ? " All this talk about fees and charging made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part with no money she did n't need to , and if you go around talking like that , you wo n't get something for nothing as long as you live . " That 's out of the question , " the Major 's wife says . " I could n't permit that . " " Two dollars , " Applegate says . " But I 've been known to take one . " " You 've been known to take one too many , " the Major says . " Now just hold on a minute . Let me explain the circumstances . " " There 's the matter of posting of the banns , " the Major 's wife says . " That 's three weeks right there . Now I have a suggestion to make . "  |p78A|p|plegate  says , " Why , I have n't posted any banns for  --  " and he begun fumbling at his vest pockets like he 'd had some of them banns around someplace but lost track . " I said I have a suggestion to make , " the Major 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two dollars for the wedding and an extra dollar to shorten up the banns from three weeks to three minutes . " " Sold , " Applegate says . " Or maybe I could dig somebody a well , " I says . " In exchange . " " Mr. Bender , we do n't have time , " Millie says . " Would n't be no more'n ten or twelve foot this near the river , " I says . " Is anyone interested in hearing my suggestion ? " the Major 's wife says loud enough to scare up a little echo from the barracks across the square . " Yes , dear , " the Major says . " First of all , where are your mother and father , girl ? " " My mother is deceased , and my father has given me his blessing , " Millie says , which I doubted . " Just answer my question , please , " the Major 's wife says . " I asked for his whereabouts . " " He runs a farm back near Plattsmouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why did you have to come all the way to Fort Kearny to get married ? " The Major 's wife did n't wait for no explanation . " Is it possible you 've run away from home ? We had a daughter that ran away from home . " " Now , Clara , " the Major says . " Would n't it be wiser to wait till we can write back to your father and be sure he 's given his consent ? You seem to be of a suitable age and deportment for domestic service . You could earn your keep as a maid , perhaps , in the meanwhile . If your father consents , well and good  --  if by that time you and this young man are still of so foolish a disposition  --  or if we do n't hear from your father and you have matureda little , the Major and I might give our consent . " The Major says , " I doubt very much  --  " " In loco parentis , " his wife says . " Loco is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting hold of my wheelbarrow handles . " Come on , Millie . " " If Applegate 's willing to be responsible , I do n't see how I can interfere , " the Major says.  | " Applegate is never responsible for anything except outrages , " his wife says . " I 'll make that four dollars , " Millie says , " but there 's got to be a certificate . " " Sold again , " Applegate says . Glaring at the Major , his wife says , " Are you going to permit this kind of disgraceful behavior ? " " The church runs its own business , I 'm afraid , " the Major says . In a clear voice Millie says , " Mrs. Kemper , you may have difficulty recognizing a determination superior to your own , but if you watch and listen closely , you may be able to detect the difference between a housemaid and a Handmaiden of Love . " " Love ! " the Major 's wife says , giving a little snort and heading for the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Millie got Applegate 's arm away from the Lieutenant and tried to get him started off in the right direction . The Major come down off the piazza and half-whispers , " Well , good luck . As long as you 're set on this , I hope you 'll be happy . " " Thank you , sir , " I says . " We aim to be . " Still half-whispering , he says , " Do you  --  uh , have a place to stay tonight ? " " Stay ? " I says , and I realized I had n't got that far in my thoughts of Wedded Bliss yet . " Perhaps we can arrange some sort of shelter for you at least , " he says . " But I do n't know about privacy . " " William ! " his wife says from the doorway . " I wo n't stand for it . " " Yes , dear , " he says , fumbling quick in his pocket and handing me fifty cents without moving his arm much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling around on my piazza all night , you 've got another think coming , " she says . He slipped a cigar case out of the inside of his tunic and offered me one , and I took it just to be polite , and he half-whispers , " You 've got a determined young lady there , but do n't mistake determinationfor being right . They 're not always the same thing . " " William ! " his wife says . " Do n't you dare help them , you hear ? " " Yes , dear , " he says . Then to me , " This is a damned hard road you 've picked , son , and do n't forget it . This end of the Territory is tougher and crueler than the other end , which is no bargain either . Nearly every man over thirty 's been married twice , and nearly every woman 's a widow , some twice over . Do n't go into it blind . "  | " William Kemper ! " she says . " I 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I went wheelborrowingoff after Millie , who was leading Mr. Blue and Reverend Applegate along under a dark , leafless row of cottonwood trees , but I did n't know whether to trust my eyes any more'n my brains . " Man that is born of woman has but a short while to live , " ReverendApplegate says with his rear end shoved up against the altar , where there was a red plush cloth hanging down and held in place by a stack of collection plates . " Those are n't the right words , " Millie says . And truth to tell , they did n't sound any too good to me neither . We had come indoors for the ceremony , even though it meant leavingmy wheelbarrow and Mr. Blue out in the thieving night for a spell : you do n't get married any too often , and you might 's well have everything nice while you 're at it . " Ashes to ashes , dust to dust , " Reverend Applegate says , spreadinghis fingers like he was sprinkling it . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Applegate had n't found his book , but he 'd located the certificates , and Millie already had one made out fair and square , and the ink and quill laying beside it ready to finish off . We was standing side by side , and I patted her hand to gentle her down and says , " It 's probably still legal . " " I 'm not paying any four dollars to get buried or baptized , " she says . Reverend Applegate pulled hisself together a bit and says , " Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife ? " " Do n't ask me , ask him , " Millie says . " I do , " I says , amazed to find it was so easy . " And do you take him to be your lawful wedded husband ? " " I do , " she says , her voice high and fluttery . " To have and to hold , from this day forward , I forget how it goes , " he says . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bender has to put the ring on my finger , and you have to pronounce us man and wife , " she says . " I do n't have no ring , " I says . " Oh , yes you do , " she says . " I 've got it right here in my reticule. "  |p81And  she fished a gold band out of her draw-neck purse and handed it over , and I slipped it on her like she showed me . " Go on , " she says to Reverend Applegate , giving him a prod in the vest . " All flesh is grass , " he says , yawning and his eyes watering . " Pronounce us man and wife , " she says . " I do , I do , " he says , getting annoyed . " I can pronounce anything . " " Now sign it . " She dipped the quill and got it in between his fingers . " Where 's my four dollars ? " he says . She showed him the money but held it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate , letting it sag down below the dotted line but staying on the paper anyway . Then I had to kiss the bride because Millie said it was the custom , in spite of Reverend Applegate and his housekeeper and the housekeeper'scrippled-up sister watching ( they had been drug in from next door to sign on for witnesses ) , and even though it had commenceddrizzling outdoors , Millie and me refused Reverend Applegate'skind offer to let us bed down on the pews for the night , me because I did n't like the look of them planks and Millie saying she had to get used to her husband 's Way of Life ( which was the first time I 'd heard I had one ) , so we walked out of there Mr. and Mrs. Ike Bender , all official , got back on the road west , and done two or three happy miles in the pale gloom of night . When we had put plenty of room between us and Fort Kearny and stray horse soldiers , we pulled off the road a ways and camped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campers he might get shot or dog-bit , and I give him the cigar to eat so 's he 'd have something to celebrate on . Then Millie showed me her best idea , which I should of thought up myself : she 'd brung along a sheet of canvas , and we flung it over and pegged it down on each side of the wheelbarrow with our blankets spread under , and then we slid ourselves in below the tub and handles till our feet was almost touching the wheel . It was like a pup tent , only better and drier and safer-feeling , and then she told me what was in her heart , which I ca n't tell because that might spoil it , and I managed to tell her what was in my heart , which I could n't tell even if I wanted to because I ca n't remember how in the wide world I ever got it said . And you can guess what happened next , and you 'll have to be/cause I 'm not going to tell except to say the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that road to many a wonder , did n't come while I was shoving the wheelbarrow ahead of me or hauling it along behind me but was underneath of it.  |p83When  we woke up , we was still married , and we was married all morning into Doby Town ( pop . 300 , not counting the people who might be drifting up and down among the huts and shacks trying to figure out how to stretch their little bit of money into loads of supplies or , if they was coming back from the gold fields busted and disgusted , how to change their supplies into something easier to carry ) , and we was walking around smiling and happy among all them worried , scairt , sour-looking , doubtful people , and there was n't no kind of advice or lies or discouragement you could n't hear . You did n't even have to ask for it but would have it shoved onto you every place you turned : some said the dumbest knothead in the world could earn five or six dollars a day if he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the good claims was taken ; some said there was no gold at all , and the whole rush was hoaxed up by merchants in Kansas City and Fort Leavenworth and St. Joe and NebraskaCity so 's they could sell cheap supplies for big prices ; some said everybody was sick and dying in Auraria and Denver City from having et their mules in the winter ; some was trying to sell guidebooks , and some stood next to them saying what a raw swindle and cheat the books was and we 'd do better to read the family Biblep84and use the maps of the Holy Land because they was just about as accurate on the subject of Cherry Crick ; some wanted to sell us a plot of land , sight unseen , where a big city was going to be , spang up against the best paydirt and how could we go wrong ?  --  and a baker 's dozen wanted to sell us shares in claims that was bound to pay off a hundredfold , just as soon as the thaw set in and the water come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had a little chunk of gold-streaked quartz and some rusty-looking pebbles or a goose quill of what they said was gold dust , which they would take me aside and show me secret and careful and spying around this way and that to be sure we was n't being overheard . I had smelt some strange places back around home and heard some tale spinning and been filched out of a few pennies and marblesand a jackknife from time to time , but nothing to put a patch on this Doby Town . Yet through it all , while Millie was inspecting the beans and flour and jerky and coffee in the general store and I was trying to keep Mr. Blue from lighting out for open country so 's he could hear hisself think , we was still being married and close and the good feeling kept running up and down the inside of my backbone , and I did n't mind all this scurrying and meanness and scrabbling and desperation . Had n't the sun come up ? And was n't it the middle of a free day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promises and spilling over the best kind of daylight ever invented ? It seemed right that every other word you 'd hear was Gold . Gold this and Gold that and Gold over yonder and No Gold No Place . I listened to the swearing and read the covers on guidebooks and looked at little chunks of rock and took a nibble at the buttery thick language on Deeds and Certificates and Bills of Sale and Shares in the Blackleg Mining Corporation and the Holy Smoke Lode and considered my nomination as the Assistant Town Treasurerof Goldville , which was only twenty-eight miles from Pikes Peak if anybody could find it among the pine trees , and I felt glad to be a living witness to all this fine confusion and meanwhile kept my jacket buttoned and my hat on tight and one eye on my wheelborrowand one eye on Mr. Blue , sharing in the laughter and talk coming out of the Sure Fire Saloon without having to join in or join up . What begun to puzzle me most was I felt surrounded by liars and fools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered could I be a liar and a fool without knowing it ? How could it only be mep85and Millie , out of all these people , who was honest and smart ? Did n't make sense , but that 's how I felt . And then I figured maybe being in love was the foolish part I could n't reckonize but other folks could , and that was how they 'd take me for a fool like everybody else . I looked at Millie arguing with the storekeep in that sweet , steady , quiet way she had , and I realized she had to be a fool too , no matter how smart she acted , because was n't she joining her life up with a fool like me ? After that , I did n't feel so plumb much like an outsider . The next man that showed me a little pinch of caramel-colored dust in his palm and told me it was gold and tried to sell me shares in his company , I says , " Did you use quicksilver to separate that ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweaty sombrero back and putting one foot up on a patch of boardwalk and looking at me square and earnest . " How do you use quicksilver to get gold dust ? " I says , that being what I had n't found out from nobody yet . " You buy into this claim and you 'll find out quick enough , " hesays . " Has n't been a pan out of her that did n't show color . " " You just put some quicksilver in the pan , and then what ? " " I 'm letting you in on the ground floor of a lifetime , boy , " he says . " Tell me about the quicksilver , " I says . Already looking around for another customer , the man says , " Makes an amalgam with the dust , and you got to squeeze it through a filter and heat it up in a retort to vaporate it off . " I did n't understand much of that . " What 's a retort ? " I says . " What kind of filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , scouting for a live one . Millie did n't tell me how much she finally spent , but to judge by the look of her mouth , it was more'n she wanted to , and we had three more bundles to add to the load , two for Mr. Blue and one for my wheelbarrow , which was going to look humpbacked till we had et it down a ways . We stopped alongside a grander hut which was the home station for the weekly mail coach , and I thought it might be my last chance to keep Millie from a lot of suffering , and I says , " Wo n't be but five days till a stagecoach comes back through here . We could camp nearby , and you could catch it back home . "  | " I do n't propose to catch anything , " she says . " You 're married now , and you 'd have something to think about while you was waiting , " I says . She snapped a quick look at me and says , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " " I mean planning things and getting our Future lined up , " I says . " Safe and sound . " " Right now my home 's underneath that wheelbarrow , wherever it might happen to be , " she says . " Or you could take the coach the other way and wait for me in Julesburg , " I says . " You would n't have but a hundred miles to go after that , and you could practice hiking while you was waiting . " " I 've already ridden part way , " she says . " You do n't seem to understand , Mr. Bender : I 'm wedded to you now . I want to see the same things you see and learn what you learn and be your helpmeet . I 'm strong . I always did more chores than Pa wanted me to . " One of the parts Applegate left off was in sickness and in health , " I says . " If you get sick or hurt , what would I do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out she always done whenever she wanted her way and meant to get it spite of flood or brimstone . She says , " He also left off till death do us part . ' And that means only death can do it , not some mail wagon . If you want to get rid of me , Mr. Bender , you 're going to have to make my deathbed somewhere along the line , but do n't expect me to lie down in it willingly . " " I wo n't do no such a thing , " I says . " Very well . Then I suggest we commence our journey , " she says . " Three hundred miles is no different from three hundred yards if you think about it properly . " And we done so , though I must not of known how to think about it right because even the first day seemed like a long ways to me . I was mostly worried about her feet : the round-toed , thick-soled brown boots she was wearing seemed all right , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inside them , and I was scairt she 'd blister herself bad . And I kept trying to figure out some way to shift all , or most all , our pack into my wheelbarrow so she could ride up on Mr. Blue if he 'd let her . Nothing 's more tiresome than worry , and the first few miles seemed like twenty to me , since I was taking all her steps for herp87and trying to fill up her boots with my feet , but she was so cheery and excited and pointing at things , pretty soon I begun to trust her to do her own walking and me mine . Doby Town disappeared behind us , and even though we could see some wagons up ahead and a few in back , it was like we was mostly alone . She would touch me on the arm now and then ( since I could n't touch her without letting loose of a handle ) and say , " You 're still there , " which I found funny and a comfort because I was n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of them strange marvels I 'd seen further back on the road , like I was a crow man or a monster or a top-turvy villagemy own self , shifting and changing . I told her about seeing them things and about how the hills had stayed far off , and she says , " They 're called mirages , " which did n't make them no less a wonder . We kept our eyes skinned for more on that endless flat stretch that rose up to low rolly hills on the left and down to sandy water and long skinny islands on the right , but it was too chill a day with the wind gusting sideways and the light grayed out , and she figured mirages done best in the calm heat and brightness . Over and over in my mind I kept fumbling with " filter " and " retort " and " vaporate " and " malcom , " wondering how I was going to rig up anything that complicated , but I did n't dare waste the quicksilverfooling with it , so I finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crock and did n't think about the Platte maybe being goldchoked . From time to time we 'd come across pieces of furniture that had been thrown out of wagons to cut down the weight for tired , underfedmules and oxen , most of it hacked up for kindling , but some not  --  specially the bigger pieces that had fell out or been pushed into the shallow river when somebody 'd tried to ford it in the wrong place and got bogged down or quicksanded : highboys and buffets and sideboards , some already bleached like driftwood , and Millie would cluck and exclaim and turn sorry and hold her hands flat on her cheeks like a housewife watching an heirloom get scratched or spilt on . We camped near one of them : a chest of drawers sticking up about two foot out of the water and ten foot from the bank , and I roped it and hauled it ashore with Mr. Blue 's help and stood it up next to my wheelbarrow to shut out the breeze and to save having to get myself wet for firewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bust up one of the drawers , but she seen the sense of it after a bit , and I got a fire going , and we set there eating beans and bacon and sipping skillet coffee ( which is fine if you do n't mind a little grease in your grounds ) and looking at that chest with one drawer missing already . And she says , " Somebody meant to have that in her bedroom out in Oregon or California or someplace , and now look at it . " I put another chunk on the fire . I think it was cherry , and it burnt sweet and slow . " Well , you can have it in your bedroom tonight , " I says . " I wonder what she thought when she had to leave it behind and saw it sitting there in the river , lost forever , " Millie says , clutching her knees in close under her shawls and letting her eyes go even bigger in the firelight . " She probably cussed a streak and blamed whoever was nearest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more romantic nature , " she says . " You must n't feel that a tender sensibility might be a drawback to your future success . Many wealthy , well-educated men are not ashamed to weep over just such an object as this chest of drawers . Even in front of others . " I tried to think it over and see it her way , but I finally had to say , " They should n't of hauled something that heavy this far . Do n't make sense . " " Perhaps it had sentimental value , " she says . ' Part of a family heritage . " Though I had n't inherited nothing but trouble so far from my family , I had to admit she could be right . " Well , I 'll feel sorry if you want me to , " I says . " We did n't have no chest of drawers at home . I do n't have but two pair of drawers anyway , so I do n't reckon to need no chest for them . " " It could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Perhapsshe lost that too . " Her eyes was shiny . " I 've got plenty of hope , " I says . " But I keep it in my own chest . " " You have mine full of hope too , " she says , touching her own small bosom so I could see her do it . I got over on my knees and kissed her , which I had been doing so much of since the night before , my lips felt wore down to the quick , but I never wanted to stop . " Mind if I freshen up the fire one morep89time ? " I says , meaning I had to break up the bottom drawer to do it , and I did n't want to hurt her feelings . " You might as well go ahead , " she says , touching one side where the water had wore off varnish and stain and left it all yellowy . " It 's of no more use to anyone except for thoughts . " I had to rattle and yank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but part of the front come loose then , and it was all full of women 's clothes , soaked the color of the Platte so 's you could n't hardly tell what they was sposed to be exactly . Millie pounced on them and fished one out and got it untangled , and it had lace around the bottom edge and some embroidery around the top and was short , but I did n't get too good a look at it because she crumpled it up and held it behind her and says , " Mr. Bender , these are a lady 's unmentionables . " Her mouth dropped open , and her whole face was spelling the wonder of it . " Perhaps some poor woman 's trousseau . " I started to pick one out of the drawer myself to have a look , but she stopped me . " Gentlemen are not supposed to deal with garments like these , " she says . " I have looked at many a clothesline , " I says . " You never saw silk and sateen and linen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , standing so 's I could n't see good and holding out piece after piece to the firelight . " Not in Cass County anyway . And not on clotheslines . " She rummaged some more , and I done my best to see , which was n't too good . " I suppose they 're all ruined and shrunk , " she says . " Well , most women are bigger than you , so maybe they 've shrank down to your territory , " I says . Being married lets you start talking out bold like that . " I really do n't think we should discuss unmentionables any more , " she says , but I seen her holding up one of them to her own front and looking down to see if it fit . " If they 're not sposed to show or be talked of or seen or known , why 's there so many different kinds of them ? " I says . " It would be too difficult to explain , " she says . " The next creek we come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I had more soap . " And she took another one out of the busted drawer , still showing pale blue through a layer of river silt.  | " I know what that one is , " I says . " That 's a corset . " Gawking under the swinging doors of the Wagonwheel , I had seen one of the dancinggirls peel down to that two years ago , and Alfie Cutler had told me what it was . My ma did n't own one , or need one neither . " I wo n't inquire how you happen to know , " she says . " I 'd be obliged if you 'd tie that rope from the chest of drawers to the wheelborrowand back again . " " Wo n't neither one wander off in the night , " I says . " I intend to dry these garments , Mr. Bender , even if it means your getting a look at them . You 'll just have to exercise restraint . " " I 've exercised everything else today , " I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I rigged up the clothesline for her , and while she was draping them unmentionables over it , crooning and clicking her tongue and muttering at them and being hen-fussy , I turned Mr. Blue loose without his pack so 's he could start his night foraging again . I had to take the chance he 'd keep coming back for more of us , since all we had was a little emergency sack of oats for him . When she 'd finished , we got ready to bed down under the wheelbarrow , pegging the canvas like before , and I did n't let her see me looking at the chemises and drawers and what-all waving in the breeze and glimmering ghostly in the last of the dim firelight . They seemed as much a mystery as what was sposed to go inside them , but not near as heart-squeezing . As I laid there with her , she still had lots of clothes on , mostly mentionable , it being our policy not to get froze in the night , but our bodies had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out of the road and fading off for a while and there 's many a helping hand to lead them . After a time , she says , " Mr. Bender , I hope our intimacy has n't made any new problems for you . " The idea had never occurred to me . " I think you 're wonderful , Millie , " I says . " It 's very difficult being a woman , " she says . " But very exciting too . I have the feeling it would be exciting even to be miserable and unhappy . " " I hope you never find out , " I says . In a quiet voice , soft as the breeze going through the lace on our clothesline , she says , " I have opened my chaste treasure to you , Mr. Bender . I hope you 've found it worthwhile . "  | " I am a wealthy man , " I says , and meant it . And then I says something out of nowhere , which I did n't understand because I had never even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation , " I says . She come even closer after that , and then we fell asleep.  | " I did n't know we had to go through a forest , " she says . " Perhapsit will be a pleasant change of scenery . Instructive too . We must learn to take instruction from Nature . " Up ahead , I seen what she was talking about , but it did n't look like no forest I 'd ever saw back in Missouri . It was too dark and too low and like the wind was blowing over it , but there was n't no wind . We 'd been walking for days now , and she had n't turned footsore or complaining and had n't wanted to stop and gossip every time we passed a wagon coming or going that had a woman in it and had n't made no trouble I could n't of made myself and had been a boon and a companion and a joy , and we was getting more and more married . Mr. Blue had taken to the new routine just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her and seemed like ours , though I always felt guilty in the back of my mind about not having paid nothing for him . The sun was out full but not hot , and it seemed like the air ought to be clear but it was n't , not when you looked up ahead at them trees . Instead , the air looked kind of shaky , and sometimes the trees was small as bushes , and other times they swole up higher than any elms or cottonwoods I 'd seen along the valley . Nothing looked right or felt right , and I says , " We better stop . "  | " You said you wanted to make ten more miles today , " she says . The woods kept moving even when we did n't , so it was n't just my eyes jogging : they stretched up over the sand hills where I 'd never seen more'n a weed grow before , if that , and now slow puffs of something  --  smoke or dust or mist  --  commenced coming from in amongst them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in the wavy air , and some was even growing in the river , which I knew could n't be . We had passed a couple of wagons heading for Fort Kearny a while back , but things looked empty up ahead except for them trees , which of course was n't trees at all . " I do n't think they 'll trample us even if they stampede , " I says . " Long as they can see us far enough ahead . Just stay still and hang on to Mr. Blue . " " What are you talking about ? " she says . " Buffalo , " I says . " But they ca n't be buffalo , " she says . " There are too many of them . " The noise started then , rumbly and far off with little crackles in it like branches getting broke , and trying to watch the herd was like trying to look at something through clear fast water : you 're pretty sure what you 're looking at , but it keeps shifting shape on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : they was galloping , some toward us , some up the slope to the valley rim , louder and louder , deeper and heavier , till the roadbed begun to make my feet buzz . I herded us off right to the low riverbank fifty yards away and got us set , with me and the wheelbarrow in front , figuring the lead bulls would keep out of the water if they could and maybe give us time and room to jump in if we had to . The herd  --  the biggest one I ever did see , though I lived to lay eyes on many another  --  had split into three separate streams , maybe more , since I could hardly see the other end of them , at least two going up the slope to the hills and the prairie beyond but one comingstraight down the road toward us . And now we could see what had fussed them up so : a half a dozen parties of men , afoot , on horseback , some on mules , was firing rifles and handguns into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and for all I knew shooting each other as often as any buffalo , though by now there was so much thundering commotion from hooves , the gunfire was all silenced over.  | " Are they harming those poor beasts ? " Millie says , looking astonishedfrom me to them . " Hang on , " I says , meaning to Mr. Blue , but she used one hand to clutch the back of my belt like she was more scairt I 'd run off , which I might of done if there 'd been a safe way to haul her and someplace to run to . But there was n't , with them shaggy heads bouncing up and clown toward us , some of them taller than me and too big to believe in , their brown beards scraping the ground and tufty tails sticking straight out . I got my revolver out of the wheelbarrow , which might of been some use if it had been a cannon , and held it up in the air with that one bullet in it , ready to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you swim ? " I yells . " I have never attempted to swim , " she yells back . " It 's only three foot deep , " I yells , hoping this was one of the regular shallow places and not some sink hole . " Do n't you dare shoot any of those creatures , " she yells . But before I could explain , the lead bull must of decided we did n't look like nothing fit to trample and sheered off , wheeling to our left and going upslope the way the rest of the herd had , and we stood there , our knees rattling with the ground thunder the huge buffs made . A tall , skinny man on horseback came busting out of the side of the cluster near us , whooping and yelling and aiming his rifle into the side of a big cow , most touching it , and when he fired , she went skidding forward on her knees and stayed down , flopping and flounderingwhile the others run past , and the man went galloping with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same pace as them . I think the cow had been lung-shot because she laid there , strugglingand coughing bright red blood and not getting her legs under her , gouging at the sand and looking like she might be bellering too , but we could n't hear it . Millie started like she was going to run over and help , though there was n't nothing worth doing , but I held her back , and we stood there about ten minutes while the buffalo cleared off south over the hills except for the dead ones and them dying like the cow near us , who lasted about half that time before she stiffened up and quit . Down the whole long stretch ahead of us I seen the carcasses sprawled out or half-dragging theirselves after the herd alreadyp95gone and the men dodging amongst them , letting off more gunfire and now some wagons coming too , some pulled by hand , and pretty soon it was meat-cutting time , and for two miles ahead it was a slaughterhouse with men yipping and cheering and finishing off the wounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hard sand looked all churned up , and there was buffalo manure dropped everywhere . The skinny man come trotting back , yelling something at another man , who 'd dismounted a hundred yards off and was already hackingaway at a carcass , and they was either pardners being happy or enemies laying claim to each other 's buffs , I did n't know or care , but when the skinny man took out a bowie knife and commenced taking that cow apart , I got our little party under way and tried to get us past before anything too bad could happen . But Millie stopped close and says , " Do n't you fear to suffer the same fate ? " I do n't think he heard her right , being down on his knees and occupied up to both elbows , which he had rolled his sleeves back from , and he turned his head and grinned and says , " Want some , girlie ? Which part do you fancy ? " She says , " Do n't you fear the savages may capture you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scalp you just the way you 're doing to that poor beast ? " He understood that all right , and he glanced from her to me and back , then started cutting again and says , " Help yourself before the Injuns and coyotes beat you to it , and do n't go laying curses on your elders if you do n't want to get spanked . " " I 'm not cursing you , " she says . " Come on , Millie , " I says . " Leave him alone . He 's just doing what thousands done before and thousands more to come . " " Are n't you interested in cultivating your more refined feelings ? " she says to him . " Do n't you want to rise above your brute nature ? " Still working , he says , " At the moment I 'm rising above it by not starving to death , little girl . It 's been a long winter . " " Come on , please , " I says . " At the moment , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " At the moment I 'm a whole lot better because I 'm in here first with the knife , " he says , grinning over his shoulder again and givingp96me a wink . " You taking this Sunday-school teacher someplace out west ? " " I draw my lessons and conclusions from what I see seven days a week , not just Sundays , " she says . " Well , I wish you 'd reach a conclusion right about now , " he says , getting back to work . I got her moving then , and we went along that bloody stretch , keeping quiet for a while and steering as far off from the strewn carcasses as possible , which was n't too far because there was dozens and dozens with men and a few women now from wagons hacking away and carting off red chunks and strips and some more skinning off buffalo hides for robes . Mr. Blue was n't enjoying the smell none and kept shying away and helping us zigzag through . Finally she says in a small , tense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , Mr. Bender ? " " I try to have as little as I can get by with , " I says . " Do n't you believe we must strive for our rightful and dutiful position , which we 're told is only a little lower than the angels ? " she says . " Well , I believe in striving all right , " I says . " But I do n't expect to crowd no angels while I 'm at it . " " But you do aspire to a higher life , do n't you ? " " That 's what I 'm doing with you , " I says . " I think . " There was only a few more carcasses between us and the open road again , and they had been gone over already and did n't look like nothing earthly , and up ahead there was n't no forest now , just the shimmering flat river with now and then a half-hint of a mirage like something trying to melt . We passed many a wagon that had come back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churned-up , dung-covered stretch behind , I could n't see nobody in front of us , and the ground turned smooth and innocent-looking . " You have to remember your family did n't come by the name of Slaughter by learning off of angels , " I says . " Mr. Bender , I have changed my name , " she says . " Well , my family must of been bending something to get ours , " I says . " And maybe it went and broke . " About dusk the next day we come to a six-foot crick with nice clear water where it looked like many had camped before , and I carried Millie over ( always get your feet wet at sundown so 's atp97sunup you can walk dry-shod ) and got us all set for supper , includinga fire made out of a busted platform rocker somebody had heaved off a wagon . But instead of cooking , Millie made me do it while she renched out them unmentionables and had washday on Sam and Frank 's blankets with a cake of yellow soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She went a bit upstream so 's I could n't see too good ( but how was I going to learn what women like to wear underneath if I do n't keep my eyes open ? ) , and I think she slipped off some things she was wearing under her dress and added them to the pile , maybe sposing I could n't tell the difference and would n't ask nosy questions , which I am inclined to do . And I knew it was hard for her because we did n't have no walls to separate us , no doors we could shut and be private , no roof to keep the sun and moon minding their own business , just darkness once a day . It takes some getting used to . While I unhitched Mr. Blue , I pretended like I was n't watching her , but I was . Everything she done was neat and straight and no waste motion to it , and when she had a pile of them wet underwears next to her and unbraided her brown hair and knelt forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went streaming along the sandy bottom like part of the water , I felt like everything she done was a kind of prayer . I felt foolish and mush-headed about it , and I caught Mr. Blue looking at me with one bulgy brown eye like he could n't calculate why it was taking me so long to turn him loose . ( No , that 's not right . You ca n't never tell what a burro 's thinking by looking him in the eye : he 's usually got his other eye aimed off somewheres else , and that 's the one he 's thinking with . I 've come to believe burros mostly do n't like what 's going on around them . They know how things should be but never get it served up to them that way , and never will , and yet that do n't stop them from knowing exactly what they want . They never get what they want and they still hold out for it . I admire stubbornness on that scale , and I reckonizesome of it in myself . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder . " He blinked once , and I could tell his mind was off on something else . He would nibble her hand any time of day and let her scratch his ears , but would have little of me or mine . I slid his pack off onto the sand and begun to rig up a clothesline for her , using the sawed/off clothes prop from my wheelbarrow , and watched Mr. Blue set off in a fast walk for the hills . And just when I had got the bacon fried and the pan bread on the way and the blankets wrung out and stretched and everything was peaceful and she had strung up the unmentionables ( some of them was showing colors now , pale green and blue and pink ) , and she seemed even shyer about them than before , I heard the horses . There was three of them , an Injun and two squaws , riding scrawny paints not much bigger than Mr. Blue , and they come from behind us and splashed through the crick and reined up and looked us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The squaws had on long , floppy deerskin dresses with just a little beadwork and all stained , and they was small and dark and round-faced and looked like sisters , but the Injun was a sight to behold and then try to forget . He was near as big as his pony and looked even bigger now because he was wearing a fresh-skinned buffalo hide without the head , bloody-side-in like he was saying I 'm the buffalo now , and he had blue paint on the left half of his face and red paint on the right , meeting between the big dark eyes and coming right down the middle of his squashed-looking flat nose , and he had his long hair braided and tied with little feathers and rawhide , and he was only wearing a small flap on his front , and where a white man would of had a saddle , he was setting on raw meat . That pony was a walking butcher shop with slabs of dripping dark flank steak and what-all heaped over the butt and draped over the mane and under the Injun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes squinted over Millie and the clothesline and the wheelborrowand the skillet and me , and he says something short and deep in Injun ( I do n't know whether he was Arapaho or Cheyenne or Kiowa , but he was n't like no Pawnee I ever seen ) , and the two squaws swung off their ponies and come to look closer at the unmentionables , reaching out to touch . " No ! " Millie says , getting her wet hair bunched back behind her shoulders and stepping between them and the clothesline . The Injun says something else , and one of the squaws says , " Tobacco , sugar , coffee , " and held out her hands like she was going to catch it falling out of the sky . The other squaw says , " Two bits , " poking her forefinger in her palm . " Two bits . Meat . " The first squaw tried to reach past Millie to touch the corset , butp99Millie pushed her arm aside and says , " What would you advise me to do , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says , standing by the fire and thinking of the gun in my wheelbarrow and the knife in my belt and not wantinganybody to get hurt over a bunch of underwears . The second squaw says , " Meat ! Meat ! " She made a gobbling motion with fingers to mouth and pointed at all that raw flesh the Injun was setting on . He swole out his chest a little , all streaked with fresh blood , and looked proud of hissel  --  . I could n't see no gun , but there was a knife handle sticking out of the buffalo roast in front of him like a saddlehorn . The first squaw says , " Whiskey , " and she went poking her nose into the wheelbarrow , where the crock full of quicksilver was showingnear the top , and when she reached for it , I knew I had to get busy . " All right , " I says , nice and loud , and everybody stopped what they was doing or about to do and looked at me , and I says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse from my back pocket with the button on it and fished out two bits and got the purse buttoned back in before the squaws could get after it . I held up the coin at the Injun . " Meat , " I says . He lit up with a big smile and says something deep and grunty , and the first squaw made a come-on move with her hand and says , " More , more . " Millie 's hand come out from under her shawls with a two-bit piece in her fingers she 'd plucked out of someplace and held it up , and the second squaw grabbed hers and mine both . The Injun slung one leg over and clumb down from his pony and lifted off two hunks of meat the size of pot roasts ( I was glad to see he did n't pick the slab he 'd been setting on directly ) , and come over to us , holding one out in each hand and grinning and nodding . I do n't know where Millie was directing her eyesight , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of askew , and I took the chunk of meat from him quick . Still grinning , he clapped both arms around me ( I felt the meat swat me in the back ) and touched our foreheads together . He smelt like life and death and everything in between , sweet and rancid and good and gamy and horrible and manly , and with my head right up against his , for a few seconds I could n't tell who was which . He turned me loose and headed for Millie , his bare flat feet hittingp100the ground heavy and proud , and when he handed her the other roast , she says quick and gentle , " What would you advise me to do now , Mr. Bender ? " " As much of nothing as will go with your womanhood , " I says . He give her a hug just like mine and touched foreheads , and she stood there , keeping the meat betwixt them and closing her eyes , and then he backed off and turned , dragging the dusty end of his raw buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto his pony again without knocking none of the rest of the meat off , and the squaws remounted , chattering at each other and each biting one of the two bits . Then the Injun stuck one of his blood-covered hands out straight , palm down , and said something that sounded like a blessing ( or at least it did n't sound like one of my old man 's cussings ) , and they rode off . Millie just stood there , holding that meat and looking kind of sick , and I did n't know what to do with mine neither . I had blood on my shirt , and I could feel it turning crusty on my forehead . Then finally Millie dropped hers on the ground and run to the crick to wash her hands and face . I picked up her chunk and held it with mine till she come back , and she looked from me to the meat and seemed to get a grip on herself and says , " I suppose we ought to be practical and keep our strength up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , Mr. Bender . " " What did you used to do at slaughtering time ? " I says , rememberingher pa kept hogs . " Run and hide , " she says , sounding meek . " Well , there 's lots of room to run out here , " I says , " but not much place to hide . " I hefted that meat , which I did n't relish any too much myself . " Would you like me to bury this ? " She smiled a little nervous at me . " Could n't you just take it off a ways and let the coyotes find it ? " I done so , then washed my own hands and face , and come back to hear her weeping soft and quiet by the fire , which she was pokingat with a piece of the genuine hand-carved oak headrest of the platform rocker . She quit when she seen me , and I set down and held my arm around her and rocked a little with her , just like we was setting by the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Walking is a sure way of getting someplace in most kinds of country because there do n't seem to be much to taking a step or two and , while you 're at it , taking a couple more and , once you get going , taking a couple dozen more . And pretty soon you do n't notice how many you 're taking ( unless you 're pacing off miles like I done sometimes ) , and you do n't have nothing to wear out or break down exceptyou and what you stand up in . And walking 's an interesting way to get someplace because you do n't miss much of what 's going on like you do when you 're memorizing the rear end of an ox or a mule and wondering which fly is bothering it the most . And with walking you never lose track of how far one place is from another , the way you can in a wagon or a boat if you doze off and start learning the inside of your eyelids by heart . But one thing you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem like ordinary time with Millie along , but some new kind , with more room in it sideways , fuller , thicker , and more noticeable . It was n't just her talking , though she done plenty of that , and me too , mostly answering . It was the way I looked at everything because I knew she was looking at it too , feeling it out and feeling it through , and I become more alert about everything under thep102sun because of her . There was n't a minute of the walking day , with me wheelborrowing and her leading Mr. Blue , when something did n't catch my eye or ear or seem to wake up some new part of my head , and I come to think of it as one of the best parts of love . ( I was n't afraid to think the word no more nor say it neither . ) Day after day and night after night , instead of catching myself napping or going dull-hearted , I 'd catch myself breathing and wakingup for the sheer wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back before Dogtown  --  the shape the current makes turning aside at the head of an island ; the plain , miserable pleasure a hostler can get out of being mean to strangers at a mail station ; the way rain turns all colors falling through sunshine ; how fearful it is to listen to somebody else 's heart beat and know yours is doing likewise and they 'll both stop someday ; the way a burro goes about appreciating oats , turning his lips in tight and bulgy like an old man gumming his mush ; the feel of your own hams touching the ground when you have n't set on them but once or twice all day ; how proud you feel when you make a fire in a place where it did n't look like there was nothing left to burn for miles around ; how many different sounds a coyote can make when he settles down to it and has a little neighborly help ; the way the moon can turn so bright some nights , you ca n't look at it no longer than if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face can be fifty faces a day , all different , and all enough to make you ache for her ; and on and on like that , forever if you 've got a mind to . We seen and heard more folks coming back from the gold fields without having stayed there but overnight , glum and burning mad and some even raving about all the gold being in the storekeeps ' teeth , about wanting to lynch the liars back on the Missouri River that had set them on the road to ruination , and we seen old wrecks like Hotchkiss setting theirselves up as trading posts , waiting for the huge flow of new springtime fools , which we was among the first of , and it 's certain sure it would of been enough to discourage us if we had n't been so happy to start off with . And since we 'd already come more'n halfway , it did n't make no difference which direction we kept walking but might 's well keep on going and see for ourselves . People would lean out of wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cussing , and some had crossed off the " Pikes Peak or " on the sides of their wagons and left " Bust " by itself , maybe adding a " By God ! " But them people didn'tp103even like where they stood or set right now . And we did . They did n't see or feel what we seen or felt right here , so how could we trust them about someplace we had n't laid our eyes on or set foot ? Many a time Millie says to me , " Is n't this beautiful , Mr. Bender ? " walking along a barren stretch of road . And it was . She was right . And half an hour later some lunkhead would be jawing and blaspheming at us about the godforsook valley we was in and the sonofabunching Platte and all like that . ( I had long since give up defendingMillie 's ears from foul language , since it would of took too much time to fight a thousand men . ) People see what they believe , I spose , or see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a lot of looking at each other in the meantime , when we was n't bumping into other wonders . One day she says , " Do you think I 'm too tenderhearted , Mr. Bender ? " " No , " I says , but it was one of the subjects I 'd worried about because I did n't want her getting heartbroke or heartsick over some of the miseries we 'd seen and was bound to go on seeing . " I believe it 's one of my many faults , " she says . " At least I 'm not tender-footed any more , but how can I get over the other without turning hardhearted ? " " I do n't know , " I says . " Maybe you better not try . " " I have always believed it was a good idea for all of us to cultivate feelings , but now I 'm not so sure , " she says . " I want to be the most useful kind of wife to you and not a drawback . " For the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any kind of wife of mine , but I did n't say so because there 's no fit answer to a remark like that when you 're already stuck . " You 're no drawback , " I says . " And it was true what you told me about that Wedded Bliss . " " I 'm very glad to hear it , " she says , smiling and blushing and givingMr . Blue an extra twitch on his rope . Which made me blush too but the same time I wished it was sundownalready and us setting by the wheelbarrow tent waiting for it to get dark enough to slip inside . Then , like I done most every day , I says , " Are you sure it 's not going to be too far for you ? You can still catch a mail wagon or stagecoach part ways . " And as usual she says , " Mr. Bender , I 'm getting stronger every day , not weaker . " And truth to tell , she seemed to be . She was n't losing weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . I did n't have no idea what I looked like , but she did n't seem worried about me . If I 'd had a mind to it and the muscle and the wagon space and a couple yoke of oxen , I could of set myself up as a blacksmith in the gold fields : by the time we begun the long curve southwest on the South Fork , where there was a couple good fording places for wagons aiming at Fort Laramie and on to Oregon , we 'd passed six or seven good-sized anvils laying on the ground and tongs and pinchers and a box full of horseshoes and a stack of rusty sheet iron and plowshares and scythes and bar iron and grindstones and a bellows , all thrown overboard along the way to lighten the loads or maybe just out of disgust with that line of work . The stuff just laid there , and nobody had room to pick it up . Or maybe lots of people done what I done : they 'd see something heavy they liked and pick it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day or two , then chuck it away again as too blame heavy . Probably some of them tools had been picked up and flung down again dozens of times and might make it to Denver City by relay in a year or two . The only things I hung on to and tied them alongside my wheelbarrow was a twohandledwhipsaw that had a beautiful set of teeth and hardly rusty at all and an ax . " What do you intend to use the saw for ? " Millie says . " I expect I 'll saw something with it , " I says . " It do n't look much good for digging gold . " She give me a peckish frown and says , " I was merely wondering why you 'd want to weigh yourself down any more than you already are . I kept it anyway and two big pocketfuls of two-inch nails out of a heap that must of been from a keg but somebody had burnt the keg for firewood . And one night we camped by a cookstove somebody had tossed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in it and baked some pretty near real bread and biscuits and then set beside it a long time , even after dark , enjoying the comfort like we was in our own kitchen except for the wind and the coyotes . When we left it behind the next day , Millie kept looking back at it , but even if I 'd tossed out the whipsaw , ax , pickax , spade , and quicksilver and give up all thought of striking it rich , I do n't think I could of brung it along without spraining my back or breaking down the Millicent Slaughter.  |p105We  seen our first pine trees mixed in with the cottonwood out on the river islands , and I knew we was getting onto higher ground . Every step had been a fraction of a fraction of an inch uphill , and the country was beginning to change . And then late one afternoon on a deserted stretch where nobody was catching up with us and there was n't nobody up ahead  --  just some traces of smoke from campfires on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , even though it 'd been halved back at the fork  --  a party of eleven Injuns on horseback come over the low valley rim and rode straight down at us , coming pretty fast like they meant business , and I got my gun into my belt and stood in front of Millie and Mr. Blue and commenced worrying as hard as I could without showing it . " Are the savages hostile around here ? " she says . " I hope not , " I says , keeping my voice calm , like she had asked was the chokecherries ripe yet . I do n't know too much about Injuns , not having got friendly with none back home who 'd tell me what they knew ( such as how to live on the prairie without dirt farming , which clang few white men can do ) , but I thought I could reckonize a war party when I seen one , and that 's what this was . When they come up close and reined in , using their thin little woven horsehair or rawhide hackamores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf , let alone a wildeyedskittery paint without no bit in his mouth nor stirrups nor saddle , I seen they was n't much older than me and some younger . But they had painted for war and carried bows and arrows and coup sticks and a couple old rifles and looked fierce and joyful and full of vinegar . The leader  --  I did n't have no trouble picking him out  --  was an uncomfortablesight and not just because he was taller and strongerlookingand had a bad wound down the side of his neck and was going bare-chested under his blanket even in the chilly weather : what bothered me most was the way he set still and stared while the others let their ponies do shifty , tight-footed little dances and laughed and chattered at each other . His pony did n't lift a hoof , and he looked like he 'd growed up there on its back , and he was wearing his hair all swooped around on one side and down in a single braid , and behind the one ear showing he 'd stuck a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , but maybe not.  |p106And  to make it worse , he was staring at me like he 'd just found the man who 'd give him that half-healed wound . " I do n't believe we 're going to be able to cover this matter with a twenty-five-cent piece , Mr. Bender , " Millie says . " Do n't do nothing , " I says . " Not yet . " A smaller and younger-looking Injun with two big feathers stickingup out of the back of his head jumped down off his pony and come toward us hunched forward and smiling . Some of the others was cackling at him and saying words , and he looked back a couple times at Blue Bird ( which is how I thought of the other one right off ) to see if he was doing something wrong and getting no sign one way or the other far as I could see . He had a bowie knife and a feather-tipped coup stick and a loose buckskin shirt with a narrow kind of bib down the front of it made out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint all aiming out from his nose and mouth , and hanging around his neck on a strip of rawhide like a necklace , he had a pair of gold-rimmed specs with one lens busted out . He stopped within arm 's reach of me and straightened up and begun acting puffed up and solemn and pursing his lips , which must of been what I looked like because all the others except Blue Bird laughed and howled to egg him on . I did n't do nothing , since being mocked at is no worse than a little bad weather and a considerable improvement on going hungry . Then this Specs started clowning around bowlegged , imitating me pushing the wheelbarrow with arms pulled down stiff and straining , and while he was staggering off in a circle and getting some more cackles , I moved three or four steps forward to give me some elbow room away from Millie in case there was going to be fisticuffs or worse , which I prayed not , eleven opponents being no fit number for a sane man with a wife to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't in the same place no more , and he come back acting crazy and teasy but a little annoyed too . Some of the others was giving him advice now , it seemed like , and he did n't want none of it . He dubbed me quick on the shoulder with his coup stick and sobered up a few seconds to see how I 'd take it . I reckoned that to be a kind of insult , a way to score off of me , but I did n't mind . I did n't have no stick of my own ,  |p107but  I tipped my hat to him and give him a little bow and a smile just like he was a nice old lady who 'd said Good Morning . He frowned over that and got some more advice from the other nine and nothing but that same long stare from Blue Bird . " How much money would you suggest I give them , Mr. Bender ? " Millie says . " None , " I says . " Just wait . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Future and Wedded Bliss , but some for me myself in my personal skin too . " Does anybody talk English ? " I says . But there was no sign from any of them , no change . I 'd heard tell a lot about the way Injuns fight , and I felt pretty sure if they 'd been feeling really smoky , they 'd of done their killing and scalping at the first swoop . This was more like bullyragging back home where a lot of kids will pick on one or two that 's different and torment them a while , then go off and think up something better to do . The only one that did n't fit was this Blue Bird , who looked man enough to face down eleven white men if the situation had been turned inside out . Seemed like I only had two choices : I could try to be as big a clown as Specs or I could try to be as steady and dignified as Blue Bird , and the trouble was I did n't think I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I had an inspiration , and I spread my arms out solemn and used the best voice Miss Wilkerson had learnt me how to get down in my chest , and I says : " 0 sweet and strange it seems to me , that ere this day is done , The voice that now is speaking , may be beyond the sun  --  Forever and forever ,  --  all in a blessed homeAnd there to wait a little while , till you and Effie come  --  To lie within the light of God , as I lie upon your breastAnd the wicked cease from trouble , and the weary are at rest . " That seemed to shake them up a little . Specs backed up and forgot to make faces , and the others talked it over a bit like they 'd just heard the first part of a Peace Treaty . " How can you possibly expect savages to appreciate Lord Tennyson ? " Millie says . But I was n't trying to get them to appreciate nothing but our right to keep on walking ( in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " In about a minute , they may take everything we own , Millie , includingour scalps , so I might 's well try giving them something that do n't cost nothing first . " They 'd begun to stir at the sound of my normal voice , and I seen Specs maneuvering to get his audience back : he begun to stalk me , circling a bit like I was a strange dumb animal , gliding his moccasins along the ground and feeling out each inch of foothold , so I spread my arms again and says , " I grieve for life 's bright promise , lust shown and then withdrawn ; But still the sun shines round me , the evening bird sings on , And I again am soothed , and , beside the ancient gate , In this soft evening sunlight , I calmly stand and wait . " Which was n't any too appropriate or even true but was all I could remember offhand from Miss Wilkerson 's elocution lessons , where even when I done my best I embarrassed myself something awful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was scairt I might be making medicine , and I was , the only kind I knew how , because I did n't want nothing of mine or Millie 's to wind up decoratingtheir necks like whoever had brung them gold-rimmed eyeglassesthis far west and was now having a hard time reading fine print  --  wherever he was  --  or maybe even breathing . Spreading his arms out like I 'd done and puffing up his chest , Specs tried mocking my voice , but he was n't any too good at it . And after just a few words , which I think was neither Injun nor Englishbut made up , Blue Bird stopped him cold and silenced him with one little grunt . Then we all just stood there for a spell , the other nine leaving off their joshing and joking and me not remembering no more poems , and Millie commenced singing . From behind me come her thin , clear , high voice , and she sang : " Though our way is dark and dreary , And we toil from day to day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home there shines a ray . Kindly words and smiling faces , Gentle voices as of yore , Loving kisses and embraces Ever wait us at the door . "  |p109Which  I had n't heard before and sure did n't sound like no home of mine , but the Injuns was listening hard and quiet , and even Specs held still like he might learn something . She sang : " Here we turn when all forsake us , Here we never look in vainFor the soothing tones that wake us Back to joy and peace again . " Then she loudened it up a good bit and poured on the chorus : " Kindly words and smiling faces , Gentle voices as of yore , Loving kisses and embraces Ever wait us at the door . " Well , there was n't a smiling face in the bunch , and I 'd sooner been kissed by Mr. Blue than one of them , but when she quit , nobody was scowling neither , not even Specs , who had backed off near the others . Then Blue Bird come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket close around him and took his slow , sweet time coming straight at me . So I took my hat off , partly out of respect and partly to hold it over my waist so 's I could get hold of the revolver handle , but even then knowing I did n't have no use for one bullet . He 'd seen the gun already , and it must not of worried him , and I was in a total fluster inside my head , wondering what to do , but I did n't let none of it get to my face . There still was n't nothing on his face but that dead , deep stare and a white circle painted on his forehead . I let my hat slip down to my side so 's he could see the gun again if he felt like it , but his eyes did n't turn that way , just kept boring into mine . He 'd been hit bad on the neck , where the jagged cut was all crusty with blood and something that looked like dry leaves crumbled up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen he did n't have a gun but a knife the size of mine and a stone ax with a stick handle wrapped in thongs and an old deerskin pouch the size of a goose egg tied around his neck . And hanging down from hisp110waist was two long clumps of black hair with bloody patches at one end , and they had n't grown on no trees . He was near enough to touch now , and I was hoping he 'd decide to bump foreheads like the buffalo Injun and we could call it a day , but instead , without no change of expression , he took his ax out of where it was stuck under the drawstring of his deerskin leggings and lifted it up high in the air aimed right at the top of my skull . He was an inch or two taller than me and had an arm on him as thick as most legs , and it looked like my hour had come . In the smidgen of an instant I had thought up all the things I could do : knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , start bargainingoff our goods , shoot him and pretend the gun was full of bullets , recite another poem even if I had to make it up as I went along , beg for mercy , and so on  --  the only thing that never occurred to me was to shoot Millie , which I had heard of being done by others to spare their spouses a Fate Worse Than Death , it being my opinion that nobody can decide what 's worse than death for somebody else . Meanwhile , I done absolutely nothing but stand there , and when I thought it over later , I figured out I did n't believe Blue Bird was going to do nothing bad . There was just something too manly about him , and I think that 's what he was looking for in me . He put on a good show of raising that ax over my head and startingto bring it down hard right on top of my skullbone , which would of taught me a lesson not to trust no dignified-looking Injuns , and raised the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , was about to tackle him . But he stopped it a few inches short , while still staring deep and fixed into my eyes and me staring back and not flinching ( though I say so , as should n't ) because I knew everything was going to be all right . How could I have a grand Future if it was n't ? He stood holding that ax over me , then just barely touched the crown of my head with it , and let a little smile come at the edges of his broad , thin lips . He stuck the ax under his drawstring again ( all the other Injuns was keeping dead still , and Millie had shut off her squeal before it hit full pitch ) and nodded at me . Then he spoke in a deep , slow voice and touched hisself between the eyes and on the crown of his own head and touched along his scar . The other Injuns made a noise like an agreement , and he took the bird from behind his ear and kissed its beak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give it to me ( what would I of done with somethingp111like that ? ) , but he stuck it behind his own ear again like a storekeepwith a pencil . Well , I did n't know quite what to do to show my appreciation and sympathy and whatever else he wanted , so I just picked the nearest thing and took out my revolver and handed it over . It was n't mine anyway , and I did n't like guns , and it saved me chucking it into the river like I 'd planned . Millie says , " Mr. Bender , " like she was beginning to protest , but I shushed her , which I would n't ordinarily do , believing in free speech . The Injun looked the gun all over , smiling broad now , and the other Injuns made them approving sounds again , and I seen Specs climb back on his horse like he knew this little game was over . Blue Bird took the pouch from around his neck and put it around mine , backed off and says something ceremonial-sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise , so I says , " God is great , God is good . Let us thank Him for our food . By His goodness we are fed . Give us , Lord , our daily bread . " Which was the only other poem I could think of offhand besides " Mary Had a Little Lamb " and " Little Jack Horner " and like that . But he seemed to like it fine , and if it was good enough for him , it was good enough for me , and when he swooped back up onto his pony ( they make mounting up without stirrups look easy , but try it sometime wearing a blanket ) and galloped off , me and Millie stood there waving till they was gone out of sight , and we did n't have to explain to each other why we was going to camp right there on the spot and not move another step in what was left of daylight : our knees just would n't of behaved.  |p112We  laid in more supplies at the sutler 's in Julesburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people arguing and looking for somebody to lynch and always forgetting to blame their own sells when they reasoned it out at the top of their voice . We heard the same kind of complaints as back at Doby Town and along the way , but it was too late to turn back now , though some actually done it . It was the middle of April and still cold and seeming to get even colder as we went along , and Millie bought a green wool scarf and a wool cap for her and a pair of wool gloves for me with only one finger missing off of a family that was headed back to Missouri and needed money for food . Some people was having auctionsright out of their wagons , but we did n't stay for none of them . There 'd be three or four people trying to sell for every one buying , and it was too sorrowful to watch their face when something preciousthey could n't eat  --  like an old watch or a patchwork quilt  --  got sold off for next to nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making off with the flour and corn meal and bacon and gingersnaps and hardtack and sardines they could n't buy , including the tanglefootand popskull at twenty-five cents a saucerful they was longingp113to drown their sorrows in but could n't . So me and Millie stored up what we could carry , quiet and quick before it got stole or burnt , and got as far away from that anger as we could . " I want you to keep a close count on the money you spend out , " I says . " Soon 's I dig us up some gold , I 'll pay you back . " We was going along slow at first , breaking in boots that was n't exactly new but had been broke by other feet back in Julesburg , still keepingclose to the river . The country was turning slopier and hillier , darker and older-looking , and the ground was harder but not froze . There was more and more groves of pine and cottonwood in spite of some being chopped down and even some bushes which Mr. Blue thawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hard buds instead of leaves . " I 'm spending our money , Mr. Bender , " she says . " Another part of the ceremony Reverend Applegate left out was With all my worldly goods I thee endow . " " I did n't expect nothing like that , " I says . " Well , you should have , " she says . " What did you expect ? " I thought it over and did n't know and says , " What would I of done without you buying me food ? " " I 'm glad you thought of that , " she says , not smug or sharp but just plain . " I 'd of had to dig a right smart of wells and privies , " I says . " You spose I 'd of turned back ? " " I doubt it , Mr. Bender , " she says . " Maybe I 'm just as big a fool as them poor , suffering , cussing , busted boys back there and was just dumb lucky to have you , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me come back skinnier and wiser . " " You do n't need to be much skinnier or wiser than right now , " she says . Which sounded like such a grand compliment , I did n't know how to handle it but gulp and shrug . I says , " You come to my rescue like I was a damsel in distress , and I did n't even know it . " " You came to mine too , " she says . We walked on a bit , and I says , " Do you realize where we 're at ? " " Yes , I think so . " " We 've got about a hundred miles to go , " I says . " How 's come you wanted to marry me this much ? " I do n't know how I dared to askp114a question like that , and I almost took it back for fear I would n't like the answer . But she says , " I admired your modesty and pride , Mr. Bender . " I thought that over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them two mean the opposite ? " " To some people , perhaps . But you combine the two very admi-rably . " " I 'd never of known it , " I says . " Why , that 's admirable too , " she says . " It is ? " Maybe one of the best things about falling in love and getting fell in love with back is you hear about so many good qualities nobody else thinks you 've got . " And you are dauntless in the face of adversity , " she says . " I am ? " I shoved my wheelbarrow along a ways . " What does adversity mean ? " " A time of peril and despair , " she says . I thought I knew what dauntless meant , so I put the two together and says , " When was that ? " " Perhaps you 're too brave to notice , " she says . " Or too dumb . " " You are not dumb ! " she says . " Pa says I was dumb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , " she says . We strolled along another hundred yards under the gray , wrinkled sky , and I says , " Well , I do n't talk good like you . " " You talk quite well enough , Mr. Bender , " she says . " If you have some rough edges , I 'm sure you 'll either smooth them or sharpen them in time . " " A man my age should n't be taking so long to smooth out , " I says . " He do n't have as much time as a rock on the bottom of a crick . " She laughed then , and it was sure a beautiful sound , and she says , " There . You just proved my point . " " I did ? " I says . " How ? " " By making a pretty speech , " she says . I could n't remember saying nothing pretty , let alone a speech , but I pretended like I understood , which you have got to do often if you want to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all of a sudden she corn/menced singing , which she liked to do and which I would of had a try at too if I 'd been able to carry a tune in a wheelbarrow . She sang : " Over the mountainsAnd over the waves , Under the fountainsAnd under the graves , Under floods that are deepest Which Neptune obey , Over rocks that are steepest , Love will find out the way . " Which I hope to tell you is a true thought ( as far as it goes ) and made me hum along and shortened the miles like the strongest kind of Injun medicine . The second day out , we come to a clump of letters and newspapersstrewn out of a ripped mailbag by the side of the road , all rain-soaked and jumbled and the ink so smeary on the letters you could n't tell what was wrote and the newspapers not prying apart without ripping . We turned over a few . " You reckon somebody robbed the mail wagon ? " I says . " They did this twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They threw sacks overboard in the middle of the night , in the middleof nowhere , just to lighten the load and make a little room . They called it Delivering mail to the Injuns . ' " She held up a pretty paleblueenvelope , the color of some of them unmentionables , and says , " How do we know whose heart is breaking up in the gold fields because this love letter did n't arrive ? " She likes to think up things like that , and then look moony and teary at me with her head a little sideways , showing her tender feelings . I have tried to practice up being tender , but it 's hard to learn , so I says , " Maybe it was just plain old bad news , telling how everybody had fell sick at home , and you better dig up a gold mine in a hurry . " I was just fooling , which you 're not sposed to do with tender feelings , but she took me serious and says , " Well , we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple more envelopes thatp116looked like they 'd come from women but all soaked and crumpled and glanced around at the rest of the mail laying all hither and skelter . " We 're going to a land where the mails do n't reach , and that means the Law probably does n't reach it much either , and we 'll be on our own , and our lives may hinge upon desperate chances . " " They might at that , " I says . " Would you say our path was fraught with danger ? " She stared this way and that . " Well , I spose that 's the general idea , " I says . Then because she was round-eyed and enjoying it , I helped her along some more and says , " We may come up against fearful odds . " " Exactly , " she says , looking pleased . " I wish you had n't given away your revolver . " All I 'd got in Blue Bird 's pouch was some little gray rocks which Millie liked to look at and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her carry it in her reticule to save me having to take it off my neck all the time . " Far as I know , that gun never hit nothing it was aimed at , " I says . " And I think I 'll take my fearful odds with as few bullets as possible flying around . " While we was standing there amongst the mail and wondering if maybe I should n't make a fire out of it , wet or not , along upriver I seen a raft coming with three men on it , the first one in a long while , the Platte not encouraging that sort of foolery with its fast , shallow current and sand bars . They was about fifty yards out , and we watched them dodging along , going bumpety and wavery whenever they scraped bottom , and we both waved , but they did n't wave back . They had a heap of goods covered with a blanket in the middle of the raft , which was skinny , tied-together logs , and they was getting their feet wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe wishingthey 'd built theirselves a wheelbarrow or handcart instead . One cupped his hands at us and hollers , " Turn back , you dash dash dash ! You 'll freeze your dashing dashes off if you dumb dashes do n't starve first ! " I was n't sure Millie had heard all them dashes before . They happened to be unusual ones , even in a country that was pretty free with dashes in about every sentence . But I just waved some more and so did she . We watched them go rickety-drifting past us and downstream and nose one corner into a sand bar , and while they tried to polep117off it , the raft spun around sideways and dunked under , slow and calm as you please , and the water come up to their thighs for a few seconds and twisted the raft right out from under them . It happened so casual and clean , it seemed like they done it a-purpose , and when the raft come bobbing up clear again , they was standing up to their waist in the river , bidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a week of campfires for somebody somewhere along the line . I hiked up my wheelbarrow handles and started off toward Slab Crick , but Millie hung back and says , " Should n't we go to their rescue ? " But they was already wading for shore , using their poles to test the bottom , and I says , " They 're only a day from Julesburg , and they can dry off walking , and I do n't like their tone of voice , and I do n't need no more discouragement than I can think up myself , and we do n't have no way to shelter them . " She come along then and says , " Yes , Mr. Bender . " Which made me feel like I 'd just been elected Governor of this country called Me and Her and Mr. Blue ( pop . 3 and Bound to Rise ) .  |p118I  could n't tell how many was following after us to the gold fields ( I knew there was some , of course ) because I could n't see backwards or ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure a heap coming back the other way , and we did n't miss none of them unless they took to traveling at night , which some done if they was mad or hungry or cold enough . And everybody we run in to seemed mad or hungry or cold or all three , specially when they seen us smiling and walking along cheerful . During one of the gaps when there was n't nobody coming for a half mile , Millie says , " Mr. Bender , I believe we give offense to people . Maybe we should try not to smile all the timeI tried to keep solemn for the next wagon that come along . The driver , a blue-nosed , stubble-faced , hollow-eyed man trying to get a yoke of skinny oxen moving faster , just stared at us and shook his head ( like many another done ) and give his scrawny , longjawedwife a look as much as to say Ai n't you glad we 're smarter than them ? And what with both of us looking so gloomy a-purpose , I believed they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stretched my face too straight and could n't keep it that way and busted out laughing and give the whole show away . Milliep119only lasted a few more seconds , then got mad , then had to laugh too . The man and his wife both peered around at us , and the wife says real loud , " You better laugh now , you wo n't find nothing up ahead to laugh at . " And her husband says , " Leave them alone , Ma . Ignorance is bliss . " They went creaking off , slow and wobbly , and if them oxen ever made it to Julesburg , I 'd be surprised . But what he 'd said bothered me , and after we 'd gone along a ways , I says , " Do you think we 're ignorant like he says ? " " There are all kinds of ignorance in this world , Mr. Bender , " she says . " But bliss is not one of them . " I figured she meant Wedded Bliss , and I had to agree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kind of bliss . We went along another few miles , ducking out of the cold breeze and trying to keep it from sneaking into our clothes , and we passed some more loudmouths full of gloom and damn-you 's and you'll-besorry 's . One rough-looking stocky man riding muleback ( after I 'd declined his offer to trade me stock in a mining company for a side of bacon ) says , " I do n't need to tell you to go to Hell , boy . You 're alreadyhere and do n't know it . " We shoved on through the afternoon and had to ford a small crick , which got my feet soaked good and proper , so we decided to camp there and dry out , and I says , " Maybe they 're right . Maybe I 'm leading us straight to our Doom . " " I never expected to hear you talk downhearted , " she says , wringingout my socks and stringing them up near our fire made out of a genuine mahogany armchair we had found busted near the crick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I 'm not afraid of my Doom , whatever it is . I do n't spore a little Doom ever hurt nobody . " " I have always believed I was destined to be happy , Mr. Bender , " she says . " And I thought you were of the same opinion . " " I am , " I says . " Bound and determined . " " Well , if you 're bound to be happy , might as well be happy along the way to it , and keep your feet tucked under that blanket , " she says . While I watched my socks commencing to steam , I says , " Mind if I ask you a personal question ? " " That 's a husband 's privilege , Mr. Bender. "  | " Why do n't you ever call me Ike ? " I says . " Do n't you like that name ? " She hesitated , not looking at me , then says , " I do n't want to hurt your feelings . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's not true ! " she says , getting all het up . " You have a very highly developed sensibility and a great delicacy in all manly emotions , and you 're not just blindly intrepid but thoughtful , and you must n't ever downgrade yourself to me or I 'll be forced to argue with you . " Well , that was too much to keep track of , and I felt confused and gushy about it . " You sure you 're talking about me ? " " Yes , I 'm sure , Mr. Bender , " she says . " And I 'll call you Ike if you really want me to , but the other seems more dignified . " " You can try me on Isaac , but it did n't take back home , " I says . " Now what kind of dignified Doom do you reckon we 're in for out here ? " " Beans and bacon , " she says . " And let 's hurry up and eat it before some wretched soul begs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of mercy in me , Mr. Bender , and you must n't let me give any more of our food away . " She had already doled out enough to worry me in the last three or four days , but I had n't said nothing , it being hers to give or keep . " We have to keep body and soul together , " she says . I turned my socks over to get them done on the other side and says , " Yes , I do n't spose they 'd be much use separate . " But the next two days we seen many a body that the souls looked to be trying to get loose of . By then , we had stepped onto the edge of the map my brother Kit had sent me and Pa had took , and was heading more south than west along the thinned-down river , and the Rocky Mountains sprung up out of nowhere soon as the morningmist cleared off , ten or fifteen miles away , and Pikes Peak was way down south of us someplace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask nobody to point it out because I did n't want to hear more cussing than come natural , which was a good deal . I begun feeling sorry I 'd give my gun to Blue Bird , since the mere look of it sticking out of my belt would of saved us a lot of wasted time telling people we could n't hand them over no food . We could of stripped ourselves of supplies twenty times over along that lastp121stretch and come to the gold fields empty-packed , empty-bellied , and empty-headed like most of the people that was trying to get out of there . But we agreed to hold firm , including Mr. Blue 's oats , which he was able to space out by chomping on cottonwood saplingsand some dead weeds and left-overs from us ( he fancied beans ) . Yet there was so many folks on the road now , either moving out or camped and trying to decide to , I did n't need no gun to keep us safe : there was always somebody watching and no privacy to get robbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time we come to D'Aubrey 's Post a few miles short of Cherry Crick ( where Auraria and Denver City had been laid out ) , and we ferried across to the mouth of Slab Crick ( it cost a whole dollar and a half , which come out of my pocketbook ) without even seeing them big sinful settlements because I was following the map in my head now and getting excited and did n't want to spend time taking in the sights . And when we got off on the west side of the South Platte and commenced heading upstream ( Slab Crick was n't but six foot wide and shallow ) past the staked-claim notices and a few strungouttepees and a couple of log huts with sod roofs , I got such a spring in my step , I felt like I could of run the rest of the way . " Can you feel that gold underfoot ? " I says . It had been snowing lately , and the slush was sort of mean , but we were on a broad , rolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till you got to the foothillsof the mountains where Slab Crick was coming from and us going . " I do n't believe so , " Millie says . " I 'm afraid my feet are numb . " " It 's only a few hours more , " I says , feeling kind of crazy , having tromped , scuffed , slogged , clewed , clumb , and stumbled more'n five hundred miles , not counting zigzags and now wondering whether I could make it a few more without turning greensick with joy . I was snuffing the air like a horse with his head in the apple barrel , and if my wheelbarrow had all of a sudden sprouted wings , I would n't of been surprised but would of sprouted my own to match . " Why do you want gold so badly ? " she says , striding along behind . " I do n't know , but it sure seems like a pleasure thinking about it , " I says . And it did . And when we come to the first miner down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grand sight and even digging out my pie pan and joining in thep122fun , except I did n't know if it 'd be polite to squat down and wash somebody else 's paydirt for him . Judging by the way he scowled when we howdied him , I kept going up the crick . " There do n't seem to be many people washing gold along here , " Millie says . " All the more for us , " I says . " Are you sure this is the right stream ? " she says . " Kit drew it all clear and plain . " After a couple miles a little side crick joined in from the other bank , just like it done on the map . After that , Slab Crick was only about half as big , though the gravelly bottom stayed about the same , which meant it had more water sometimes . " I have a stitch in my side , Mr. Bender , " Millie says . And I slowed down a little then and tried to enjoy the last of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all down at once , but even when my legs behaved theirselves , my mind 's eye kept racing around inside my head , and I did n't need no mirages or natural wonders to spark up my admiration for the Future : about every ten steps I seen a place where I reckoned I 'd ought to dig a hole , and I seen myself doing it and seen it panning out and me and Millie yipping and dancing around it and tossing gold up in the air by the handful and letting it rain down ( which it done nice and slow , even the coins and nuggets I dreamt up ) , and for sheer blind happiness that short trip up Slab Crick would be hard to beat ( bar Wedded Bliss ) because I shed nary a drop of sweat in all that dream digging nor had no disappointments nor felt a half ounce of doubt nor put myself to the trouble of doing no chores but pickaxing and shovelingstraight to pure gold . " Why are so few people prospecting ? " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I says . " And maybe it has n't thawed enough water yet . " But I did n't let anything peck away at my bumper crop of good cheer . She glanced around like she might not be having quite the same daydreams as me , but says , " It looks like rich country , and I love being here with you , Mr. Bender . " Which was too good to pass up , so I set down my handles a minute and give her a long kiss without begging Mr. Blue 's pardon or asking leave of another old-timer sloshing water around in his pie pan fifty yards upstream of us . But kissing Millie always brung up other daydreams of a different order , and when we commencedp123traveling again , I had got the gold digging all mixed up with sleeping next to her under the wheelbarrow , and my mind dreamt up some mighty unlikely events in the combined history of Love and Mining , which I would n't care to tell . But she had called me back to the world with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being there with her too , and them were the two most important matters , and all the rest would have to line up behind and wait their turn . We followed Slab Crick all the way to the foothills , which rose up sudden out of flat country and shut out the sight of the mountains beyond , and the last miles was the hardest we done in the whole trip : up slope and down ravine and through cottonwood , serviceberry , and chokecherry thickets , and it was all I could do to haul my wheelbarrow through some of them squeaky places where the crick come down steep . But it leveled out again once in a while , giving us a chance to breathe a few times , and then after a long uphillstretch and up over a hump , we come to the hut , the only one we 'd seen in the last three miles . So we got a plain look at the headquarters and main office of the Collywobble Mining Company , which had dead grass on its flat roof and smoke coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple windows made out of scraped deerskin and a low stoopdowndoor . And there it was , all laid out in front of us : the hard , crusty ground shelving down to the crickbed and clear water running down the middle of it and a forty-foot , sharp-edge clift along the opposite side and the hut set back fifty foot on our side and a little stand of mixed pine and aspen . And our claim was right there , looking like the Promised Land , shimmering even in the gray lateafternoonlight and so full of gold it probably did n't matter none where you scratched gravel for it . I felt like untying the pickax and shovel and starting right to work . Somebody had built fires here and there along the bank , and I seen where some dirt and gravel had been scrabbled off under the scattered charcoal , so I reckoned the ground was still froze and that 's why they was all still in the hut and not out washing for dust . I trundled us right up to the front door and knocked and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud and tuckered out and ready to bust with excitement . It seemed like I could smell the gold all around us and hear it singing . The door opened a crack , and an old man stuck his nose out ,  |p124frowning  , and says , " Who 's that ? " and the same time a younger man wearing a sleeveless jacket made out of what looked to be blackbearfur come around the outside edge of the hut aiming a rifle at us . But that did n't slow me down none . " Well , we made it , " I says . " Made what ? " the old man says . " You kids get the hell off of this claim , " the man in the bearskin says . " I 'm Ike Bender and this here 's my wife Millie , " I says . " Where 's Kit ? " " Jesus God , another , " the man in the bearskin says . " What do you want ? " the old man says , blinking out at us with his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of his beard . " Aim that someplace else , " I says to the man in the bearskin . " There 's a lady present . " He let his rifle sag and says real loud , " Badger ! Come here ! " " Kit told me to come and join up with the company , and I done so , " I says . " I kept my part of the bargain . " " Well , you 're some bargain all right , " the man in the bearskin says . " What 's that thing ? " and he prodded the Millicent Slaughter in the side with his rifle barrel . " That 's my wheelbarrow , in case you never seen one , " I says . " Where 's Kit ? " " You pushed that thing all the way across the Territory ? " the man in the bearskin says like it was the best joke he 'd heard since the tent show . " Well , sometimes I hauled it instead of pushing , " I says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , ma'am , " the old man says . " Ai n't used to talking around a woman . " " That 's perfectly all right , " Millie says . " I have heard enough foul language in the past weeks to burn my ears forever if I 'd let it , but I prefer to let it pass me by . " A fat man in a red fur hat with a red pointy nose and dewlaps come around the edge of the hut , wearing a patched homespun shirt and a whole deerskin over him like a long shawl . The old man stepped halfway out of the door and says , " That 's Badger and John Staggs there , and I 'm Zack Orfrey . " " Pleased to meet you , " I says , giving my hat a little heist . " Kit did n't say you was coming , " the old man says . " He just toldp125us he was thinking of asking his kid brother to come on out . " He acted sheepish and kind of apologetic . Staggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him No Siree loud and often . " The one called Badger come forward and give our packs and Mr. Blue a squinty look and says , " Looks like that burro 's old lady might of got herself tallywhacked by a gopher . " Staggs got a big guffaw out of that , but the two of them looked like they 'd been crossed with three or four kind of critters : pretty near everything they had on from head to toe had been skinned off something else 's back . Yet I did n't want to start gnashing back at them and spoiling the company , which it begun to look like I did n't belong to . Zack , the old man , says , " Well , you better come in and set a spell while we get this figured out . " " Wait a minute , " Staggs says . " I do n't recollect inviting nobody to come into this house I helped build with my own two hands . " " Me neither , " Badger says . In a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over , boys . What if your brother was to hump it all the way across the Territory looking for you ? Would n't you give him a  --  " " I 'd shoot his ass off , " Staggs says . " I do n't have no brother , " Badger says . " Would n't you give him a place to set down and a bite to eat , seeing he 'd brung along a sweet little wife young enough to be your daughter ? " Zack says . " Hell , no , " Staggs says , but smiling a little now . " That 's better , " Zack says , shoving the door all the way open and getting out of the way so 's we could file by , Millie first . " Come in and welcome . " It did n't smell any too rosy in there , that being the way men get when there 's no women around to wash up and renal out and scold , but they had added something extra by using one whole wall for meat hangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was upside down and skinned , but I seen Millie drinking it all in by the dim light and wished we was outside again . " We been wintering in here , so you 'll have to make allowances , " Zack says , getting both his suspenders up and his long-tailed blues tucked in . " Would you like a stool , Miz Bender ? " There was n't but a rough table , a bench , two stools , a tubful ofp126sir . Staggs had come in and was leaning by the door with one leg hooked around his rifle butt , but Badger was still outside . " Well , now , the Collywobble Mining Company ai n't exactly closed up and finished off , " Zack says , " but if that fool brother of yours shows up next week or whenever the thaw gets going good , and we get organized proper with our long torn , there wo n't be much room for another pardner . " " No room at all , " Staggs says . " See , we got it all staked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working claim and an extra for discovery , and Staggs has got one and Badger one and Kit one  --  the furthest upstream  --  that 's five hundred foot of crick . Now if you want to stake yourself one up past Kit 's , you 're welcome , but I 'll tell you it do n't look any too good to me , and I seen myself staring back out of many a pan in my day , boy . " " Well , Kit says if I was willing to work hard and pitch in , you 'd take me on , " I says . " He did n't have no right to say that , " Staggs says . " See , we do n't know how good it 's going to be , " Zack says . " Might be nothing much here , might be pockets full of glory down on that bedrock . But it would n't do to give away a big chunk of it , not knowing , just to be nice to a young man like you . " Staggs give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock down in Denver City , Zack . " I had two things going on in my head at the same time , and they did n't mix too good : I was trying to shape our Future ( including that very night ) to fit what I understood about this talk , and I was trying to keep from being too uneasy about my wheelbarrow out there with that Badger maybe nosing around it . " How much would a share in this company cost ? " Millie says . Zack shook his head . " Well , you just ca n't figure a thing like that without  --  " " How much you got ? " Staggs says , standing up straight . " Now wait a minute , " I says . " Maybe Kit 'll go shares with me onwater , an iron pot and skillet by the fireplace , and three heaps of pine boughs with blankets over them on the dirt floor along one wall . I could of touched the ceiling made out of skinny logs laid crossways . She set down with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p127his  claim . Or maybe there 's another crick around here someplace . " I was strolling to the door , which I seen was open a crack . " That 's up to him , " Zack says . " But your brother 's got a bad case of the gold colic , boy , and I would n't count on him giving nothing away till I had it wrote down and filed at the land office . " " Staggs was sort of blocking my way without quite showing he was doing it , and he give me a big fish-eating grin and says , " If you wait around a month , Bender , maybe we could use a hired hand or two . You and the burro a dollar a day each to haul tailings and your wife there fifty cents to cook . " " How can you stand to live in an abattoir ? " Millie says . " A what ? " Zack says . " Excuse me a second , " I says to Staggs , trying to get past him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he was joshing me . " That 's good wages for a boy , " he says . " And that burro wo n't spend nothing on whiskey . " " I am referring to the carcasses and corpses and entrails and skins hanging on your wall , " Millie says . " Well , Miz Bender , we 're out here in country where the corn do n't grow , " Zack says . " I tried eating rocks but it did n't work . " " I want to go outside a minute , " I says to Staggs . " Calls of nature out back , " he says . " Could n't you at least hang the corpses outdoors somewhere ? " Millie says . " The bears and Injuns would love that , " Zack says . " But it would n't do us much good at suppertime . " I finally had to shove Staggs out of the way , being as polite as I could without giving ground , and I ducked out the door , knocking my hat sideways , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I run to the side of the house , there was Badger fifty foot up the slope carrying my whipsaw over his big fat shoulder and the crockful of quicksilver in his other hand.  |p128I  grabbed the ax off of my wheelbarrow , not wanting to go empty-handed , and lit off after him , and I says , " Mr. Badger ? "  --  not yelling so 's to keep everybody else from getting worked up , it being my belief that the fewer folks involved in a fight , the shorter it 's likely to be . He stopped , looking surprised and shifty-eyed and mad , holding the little crock behind his deerskin leggings in case I had n't seen it , and then he put on as good a face as he could , since he did n't have but two choices  --  run or talk  --  and running 's hard work . " I believe you 've got something of mine there , " I says , stopped two steps off . There was a little pine grove a few yards up ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and lost our elbow room . He grinned on one side of his face and says , " Just going to saw me a couple planks , boy , long as you was n't using it . " I seen a stack of rough-cut , six-foot-long sluice boxes  --  the kind I 'd seen tore out of The Miner 's Own Book and nailed up at the generalstore back home  --  and a couple of sawhorses , but Badger had n't been heading for them but off slantways into the woods , and I says , " You did n't ask my leave . "  | " People do n't have time to go through all that neighborly talk way out here , " he says . " And no sheriff to learn them how . " He looked at my ax . " You fixing to chop some wood ? " I felt ashamed about that ax . He was a whole lot fatter than me but no taller , and after all that walking and hauling , I was as strong as I was ever going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you was a mind to . But the whipsaw was a mean-looking chunk of steel with teeth as big as a bobcat 's and five foot long from handle to handle , and I did n't fancy being mistook for no pine tree . So I just hefted the ax to show him I knew which end was which and says , " Yes , sir , I was . And I reckon I 'll need that whipsaw to go with it . And my quicksilver too , if you do n't mind . " He looked down at that heavy little crock as if he 'd forgot all about it . " I just borried a taste of this jam to sweeten up the sawing . Ai n't had a taste of jam in eight months . " " Badger ! " I heard old Zack 's voice yelling from back by the hut , but I did n't let my eyes stray off . " Here , you can have it back , " Badger says , holding the crock out a short ways . " If you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could see I was going to have to get too close to him , and though that meant be could n't swing the saw good , I did n't fancy rassling with nobody that fat . I says , " I 'd be much obliged if you 'd just bring both them things back to my wheelbarrow and put them the way they was . " " Well , who was your slave last year , boy ? " he says , flexing the saw by one handle and making it sing . " Goddamn it , leave me alone , " Zack yells back behind me , but I did n't turn to look . " You 're mean just like your brother , " Badger says , grinning . " I reckon I 'll make you fight me for this trash here , just to teach you how we do things on Slab Crick . " " Mr. Bender ? " Millie says , loud and high . " Which leg do you reckon you can best do without ? " I says , hefting the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed the crock off to one side , and I heard it thud and roll but kept my eyes off it , hoping it had n't broke . Badger took a half a step backwards and had both hands on one of the saw handles . " Which of them heads of yours would you like to have lopped off ? "  |p130From  near behind , Staggs 's voice says , " You raise that ax on my pardner , boy , and I 'll shoot you right in the spine . " Half out of breath , Millie says , " Is there anything I can do , Mr. Bender ? " " Yes , stay clear , " I says . " Now what in the hell is going on ? " Zack says . " What you doing with that boy 's saw ? " " Zack , you dumb bastard , why do n't you go take a walk and practiceup lying ? " Staggs says . " No sense to quarreling among our-selves . " " Mr. Badger walked off with my whipsaw and my quicksilver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says . " Go on , give him his saw , you damn tub of lard , " Zack says . " Quicksilver ? " Staggs says . " Where at ? " Out of the corner of my eye , I seen Millie scampering and stoopingand picking up the crock , and I kept my ax ready for all the bad things that could happen any second now , hoping I would n't have to chop nobody . " You ca n't just rob a man out in plain sight and expect him to lay down like a lump , " Zack says . " Not unless you 're aiming to kill him . " " Might just do that , " Staggs says behind me . Then he shifted off further to one side and says , " Little girl , let me look at that crock a minute . " " This happens to be our property , Mr. Staggs , " Millie says . " And it 's not open for inspection . " " Now you just do what I say , " Staggs says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardners in my day , " Zack says . " But if this do n't take the rag off the bush , excuse me , ma'am . " Sweat was coming down Badger 's jowls now ( I do n't know what was coming down mine , being too busy trying to make up my mind which way to jump , swing , or at least look ) , and he says , " Staggs ? " with his eyes flicking over my shoulder at what was going on . " Just a second , " Staggs says . " Now , little girl , I 'm not asking a whole lot . Just a peek inside there . " " Under the circumstances , that is an unreasonable request , " Millie says . " And I do n't mean to oblige you . " " Staggs ? " Badger says , starting to look mighty worried about my ax . " Give him his goddamn saw before we have to use it to get yourp131leg the rest of the way off , " Zack says . " Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All right , all right , I only borried it a minute anyway , " Badger says , holding out one handle at me . I took it in one hand , and for a second he held on to the other handle , and I thought we was going to play tug-of-war but he let go with a shove and turned and walked off past me toward the hut . Which give me time and room to see about Staggs , who was holdingone palm out to Millie and wheedling at her while she backed up , keeping the crock behind her . I set the whipsaw down so 's I 'd have both hands free for the ax and says , " Leave my wife alone . " Staggs come to a halt and turned on me , smiling and aiming his rifle down around my feet , but before he could say anything , Zack says , " Let 's have some sense here now . " Staggs says , " All I asked for was a  --  " " I know , I know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head like an apology . " We been winterbound , and it makes a man tetchy . You get to quarreling over nothing , and first thing you know , somebody'sgot theirself shot or cut . Seen it happen many a time . " " Listen , " Staggs says . " How much quicksilver you got ? " He sounded halfway reasonable , so I says , " Five pounds . " Zack give a little whistle and smacked his lips like a kiss , and Staggs says , " If your brother has went and froze his ass off up in the mountains someplace  --  which ai n't any too unlikely , believe me  --  why , it 'll be all right with us if you inherit his claim , long as you throw in the quicksilver and the burro . We all work the long torn and share and share alike . What say ? " I picked up the whipsaw , got it over my left shoulder , and nodded Millie ahead of me down the slope toward Mr. Blue . " We 'll think it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Staggs says . " Kit was n't fool enough to get froze , " Zack says , but did n't sound too sure about it . They come along behind me , and I says , " How long 's he been overdue ? " " A week , " Zack says . " And in another week or so , the crick 'll be up and the dirt loose enough with a little coaxing and we 'll be ready to roll , and if he ai n't here to help , why , we 'll give his share to you , " Staggs says . " Wo n't we , Zack ? "  | " I do n't know what 'd be legal , " Zack says . " We 'd have to go clown to town and  --  " " If we ca n't make up our own mind about our own goddamn company , what the hell 's the use having one ? " Staggs says . I begun tying the saw on to my wheelbarrow , while Millie tucked the crock under the oilskin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till Kit comes back , " I says . " I would n't want to take nothing off him without his say-so . " " He wo n't be saying much with a mouthful of snow , " Staggs says . " What makes you so sure he 's froze ? " I says . " Just talk , " Zack says . " You set around talking all day , and pretty soon you forget the difference between what you dreamt up and what you know . " " If Kit was all right , he 'd be here , " Staggs says . Zack put his thumbs under his suspenders and stomped his feet a little to warm them up . " Unless he found something better . " I got behind my wheelbarrow handles , but Staggs got around in front of the wheel and says , " Now do n't go off half-cocked , boy . " " You can bed down in the hut tonight , " Zack says . " Not too comfortable , but  --  " " No , thank you , " Millie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold up here , " Zack says . " Not like down on the flat . What 's the sense in  --  " " I 'd be much obliged if you 'd show me where Kit 's claim leaves off , " I says . " Is it staked ? " " Boy oh boy , these Benders all got shit for brains , " Staggs says . " Watch your foul mouth , " Zack says . " Oh , kiss my ass , " Staggs says , turning to go to the hut . " Mark off a square , you 're all ass , " Zack says . " Excuse me , ma'am . " " After we have established the Hearthstone Mining Company on a sound legal footing , " Millie says , " we may consider the possibilities of a merger . " From over by the hut door Staggs let out a cackle . " Well , she do n't talk like a Bender , but she sure thinks like one . " Be sensible now , " Zack says . " You had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't mean to fool with nothing or nobody , " I says . " Where 's those boundaries ? " The hut door slammed shut , and Zack walked us down toward the crick and along it and says , " If you 're going to be stubborn aboutp133this , you got about an hour and a half to sundown , maybe less , and you 'd do yourselfs a service to at least knock up a lean-to . Know how ? " " Well , I seen a few along the way , " I says . " I can show you , " Zack says . " If it ai n't against your principles . " We went up the crick along fairly level ground , while Zack pointed out the claim stakes every hundred foot , and when we come to the far side of Kit 's claim , the little gully had narrowed down and steepened . Up ahead I seen where the bank turned near as steep as the low clift on the other side . " Is there some way I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I was to wade another hundred foot upstream , I 'd have to drive a stake in sideways . Does sideways count ? " Zack says , " If you ca n't get up there to drive it , nobody 's going up to see if it 's been drove . " But the first ten foot next to Kit 's was pretty level , and up from shore a ways Zack picked out two pine trees standing side by side about eight foot apart , and says , " Cut yourself a pole and lash it between them two , high enough so 's you can sit up underneath . Or stand , if you 're feeling like that much work . Then lash some more poles back from the first pole to the ground and lay your pine boughs across , commencing down low and building up so 's most of the rain or snow or whatever else is going to fall out of this damned sky will mostly drip off . If we get anything heavy , you 'll have to run a ditch along each side toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open end facing this way because the winds here either go upstreamor down , and you do n't want no smoke in your face nor snow in your lap , and you do n't want no drifts building up in back of you and crunching you down in the middle of your sweet dreams , so get to work . " " When does it leave off snowing around here ? " I says , getting out my ax and some nails and heading up for the pine grove . " Son , this is still April , and it 's liable to do most anything you can think of , " Zack says . " Even in May . And if you got any more surprisesin that kit of yours besides quicksilver and real nails , you 'd best not let Staggs and Badger find out . They do n't just hunt birds and beasts , them two , and as a matter of cold fact , we 're pretty scarce for white women in these parts too , and I would n't leave this young lady alone much if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of taking care of myself , " Millie says . " I do n't permit forwardness or familiarities from strangers . " Zack shook his head . " Most men in the gold fields do n't ask for no permission in matters like that . They just barge on ahead . " " I have already become acquainted with most forms of human wickedness , Mr. Orfrey , " she says . " It would take a great deal to surprise me . " " I was n't worried about you being surprised , " he says . " But hurt . " " I 'm grateful for your concern , " she says , " and I suppose forewarnedis forearmed . " Zack helped me trim some saplings , and when I commenced nailingone up about seven foot high between the pine trees , using the butt of the ax for a hammer , he says , " My God , you building a leantoor a house ? " " When you 've lived under a wheelbarrow for six weeks , you want a little head room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework to slant back from the crosspole , while Millie used my knife to cut some boughs , and he says , " I still wish you 'd bunk down with us back at the hut . Sometimes it 's safer being close to trouble than a little ways off by yourself . " " No , thanks , " I says . " Do you have a gun ? " " I had one but I give it away , " I says . " I do n't like to shoot nothing . " " I wish you a world of comfort with that notion , " he says . " But it do n't seem very likely . You aim to hunt with your bare hands ? " " I do n't aim to hunt at all , " I says . " We 'll go down to town once a week for provisions , " Millie says . He shrugged over that but did n't say nothing , and pretty soon we was all three cutting boughs for the slant roof , and he showed how to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . " It 'll seem grand and soft the first night , " he says . " And tolerable the second , and hard and lumpy the third , and then you have to make yourself a new one . " " What do you think we should do about Mr. Blue ? " I says , whenwe stood back to admire our brand-new house , which looked morelike something that had fell down by accident than done a-purpose . " Turn him loose and hope he do n't get shot for a deer , " Zack says . " He knows more about getting along up here than you do . Why ,  |p135if  you knew what he knows , you 'd have damn little to worry about . " " And I would n't be up here gold digging neither , " I says . " You 're dead right , son . A burro 's got too many brains for that . " I had got him off a ways while Millie fussed with the bed , and keeping my voice low , I says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Know it a whole lot better than I want to , " he says . " You know how it 's all full of that yellow grit ? " He spit and says , " I ground up enough of it hunting for the water in between . " I felt embarrassed bringing it up , but I says , " I do n't spose there 's no gold in that , is there ? " He give me a long blank look . " I did n't think so , " I says . He chuckled then and says , " You 'll think you see it lots of places where it ai n't . And then maybe someday , by God , there it is for sure . " Millie come over to us then , and I says to Zack , " I reckon you know a lot about gold digging . " " Son , I know so much about it , I do n't even know what I know . " " Then how 's come you 're not rich ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of gray teeth . " I been rich . Twice . But I did n't like it much neither time , so I spent it all . " He held the flat of one old knobbly-knuckled and scarred hand up . " Do n't ask me why I 'm trying for three . It 's the looking I like . I even like the finding . But what happens after you find it is too much for my guts . All gold is fool 's gold if a fool 's got ahold of it , and I 'm a fool . " " I reckon I am too , " I says . " You most certainly are not , " Millie says . " I wo n't have you talk that way . " " Well , maybe you 'll get a chance to find out for sure , " Zack says , scuffing the toe of his boot on the hard ground . " You might wash a little out of this . Enough to get sick on , maybe . " " Thanks for all your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to back off and head for home . He 'd come out in his shirtsleeves and was looking shivery in the pale light that was fading out quick now . " There 's some of us still do a little of that , " he says . " A stranger used to be near as good as a pardner till proved otherwise . "  |p136We  watched him hunch off , one leg swinging kind of bowlegged like it had been busted once or twice , and I got to work with the ax and whipsaw and laid in a little firewood while I could still see what I was aiming at . Millie unpacked Mr. Blue and give him some oats and turned him loose , and he come up and watched me sawing through a six-inch dead tree trunk like he was studying whether to get hold of the other handle or not . But he finally set off at an angle uphill through the trees , nosing at the thin brush here and there and taking a nibble , and disappeared . I built the fire where Zack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set in shelter and it could burn out in the open . And after we 'd et slow and quiet , and it had turned dark and the stars come out sharp and strong , I felt tireder than any other night on the whole journey and maybe in my whole life and had to keep jerking my head up so 's it would n't fall off and roll down into the crick . After a bit , Millie says , " Mr. Bender , you brought us safely all the way . " " If it was n't for you , I 'd be back at Fort Kearny or someplace welldigging , " I says . " And we 're here , and we 've actually begun building our castle , " she says . " We do n't have our battlements up yet or our men-at-arms or our drawbridge , but we 've made a start . " I 'd read some of them books like that too , so I says , " Well , the throne room 's as big as all outdoors , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure 's all spread out underfoot . I hope . " " It does n't really matter , does it ? " " I 'd just as leave find it as not , would n't you ? " I says , but she did n't say nothing , just begun getting our blankets ready , spreading our canvas over the bed of boughs first , and we slept sound through that cold night in a cloud of evergreen perfume , with me hanging on to one of the whipsaw handles and her nursing the crock of quicksilver at her bosom , which just goes to show you how good it was at locatinggold.  |p137There  was so many things I wanted to do in the morning , I did n't know which ten of them to start off on . When I had shook the sleep out of my head and washed it out of my eyes in the icy crick , I seen everything fresh and strange : a hundred foot of crickbank and fifty foot up from shore and all claimed as ours and every square inch of it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to or did n't want to get wet admiring close . It may not of looked too good to Zack , but to me that humped-up , washed-out , rock-hard slice of gulch was the grandest in all Creation , and first off , I reckoned I 'd get us a hearthstone , sort of to prove we 'd chose the right name . I took my pickax out to the crickbank where it begun to turn steepest yet still give me a foothold and spent ten minutes learning why Zack and the boys was n't panning gold or using rockers or long toms yet . I settled on a slab of rock stuck into the bank edgewise and looked to be about the size of the petit-point cushion Miss Wilkersonused to keep on her horsehair sofa . But by the time I got it loose from the stuck-together dirt and gravel I had chipped and cracked it down to no bigger than a roast platter and half as thick as it started out , and my elbows was buzzing and I was scairt of breaking the pick handle . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top138the lean-to , where Millie was arranging things here and there under shelter , fussy and happy and whistling , which she could do near as good as a bird . And I says , " Well , the Hearthstone Mining Company 's got itself a hearthstone . Now all it needs is some mining and some company . " She laughed and admired it more'n it deserved , and I commenced hollowing out a shallow place for it where our fire had thawed the dirt some , and when I 'd got it laid in level , I stood up and done some admiring myself and held hands and felt married and pardnersand in love , and then I went loco . I seen that dirt and gravel I 'd scraped loose to fit the stone in , and it dawned on me clearer than the real dawn that was looking brighter and bluer by the minute , There 's no reason a pan of that would n't wash . And I dug into my wheelbarrow and come out with my big pie pan , which I had n't used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it full of that wet , cold dirt and all-sized gravel and run down to the crick with it , lucky not to fall down on my face and send it flying . I hunkered the way I seen the old-timers doing it downstream , dipped it full , and begun swirling and spilling it little by little , trying to go slow and be in dead earnest but all the time feeling fuller than the pie pan , and Millie came down halfway to watch and the clear water skimming along next to me , leaving thin slivers of ice along the edge and me panning for gold on my own claim ( though I had n't wrote nothing down yet nor drove a stake nor been to the Land Office ) and everything seeming like a joy , even the hardest chores which I probably had n't even thought up yet . First nothing but muddy water come over the sides ( and oh ! my fingers commenced getting cold ) , but then little gritty pieces of crushed rock that was n't quite sand come along and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunks , making sure each one was n't no nugget in disguise , and then I could spill some more and pick out some more gravel and add a little more water and spill it , and pretty soon I could tell I was n't going to have much of nothing left in the bottom except what Pa left when he got hold of a real pie in a pan like that . Finally there was just a quarter inch of scummy brown-and-black sand for me to poke at . I rubbed it between my thumb and finger , and I seen gold specks in it . I reared up and says to Millie , " I think I struck it , " and my mouth would n't go shut , and next thing I knew I was running along thep139edge of the crick , holding that pan with both hands like it was the last drop of water in the desert , and heading for the hut , yelling , " Zack ! Zack ! " He come out of the door and gawked at me , wearing an old long sheepskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out , and first he just stood there waiting , but finally did some hoppityskiprunning hisself to meet me with his eyes popped wide but puzzled-looking , the wrinkles in his forehead going up in the middle . I did n't say nothing but slowed down without knocking him over and give him the pan and watched him squint down in it and rub it and hand it back , smiling now . " It 's gold , ai n't it ? " I says , feeling even more certain with that look on his face . " Well , you might call it that , " he says . I let out a whoop and a yip and almost dropped the pan , but Zack got hold of me before I could commence running back to Millie . " It needs some more separating , and if you feel inclined , you can scrape it off into something like a spare pan till you get enough to be worth working on with some of that quicksilver , " he says . He was so calm and offhand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged , and I says , " This is n't no good ? " " Well , you got a little color there , son , maybe about average for the worst places along here , " he says . " One cent , maybe two . " I had worked ten or fifteen minutes and froze my hands numb and used up most of what little the fire had thawed , and I was one cent the richer . Yet somehow I did n't feel bad about it . " Oh , " I says . " I reckoned it was more'n that . " He give me a dark smile through his beard and says , " So I noticed . " " But it sure is fun , ai n't it ? " I says . " Maybe I better hunt some more , " and I turned to start back . He come along , strolling slow like he did n't have nothing better to do , and out of the corner of my eye I seen Staggs stick his head out the door to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zack says . " Deeper some places . If there 's good paydirt here  --  and I think the signs show it  --  it 'll probably be down there . Gold likes to go deep and lay low . " Well , I 'd known that , or thought I had , but sometimes forgetting is too much of a pleasure to pass by , and besides , now I knew what I 'd act like if I ever did strike it.  |p140Zack  must of known pretty much what I was thinking . " You find out something about yourself , boy ? " he says . " Yes , sir . " " Bound to do lots of that in a gold field , and some of it 's a caution and a revelation , and some 's dreadful , and some 's just plain tiresome , " he says . " What was yours ? " " A caution , I expect . " " We can all do with some of that , " he says . I thought for a little ways , then says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ca n't say for sure , but he most likely has a pretty good idea how hungry he is by now . Is and was . " Zack give me a glance to see if I was listening , which I was . " And I do n't mean just belly hungry . " I walked some more and thought it over and says , " Why 'd he go up in the mountains by hisself ? " " Hard to say . I think he was scairt he 'd kill Staggs or Badger or both or get kilt trying and figured he might 's well risk his life doing something 'd make him rich instead , such as prospecting in snow . I 've done it myself , boy , and for my druthers , I 'll take hunting grizzly with a spoon . " " Do you think he 's froze ? " " Probably not , " Zack says . " But sick maybe and sure enough sorry . " " Think I should go look for him ? " " Not unless you can swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This crick do n't amount to much , but it 's going to rise and so 's every other trickle out of them mountains , and if you think you seen slow countrybefore , you just try springtime in the Rockies . Ever been in the mountains ? " " No , sir . " " Any mountains ? " " No , sir . " He stopped and spit in the crick , then looked along it both ways like he was expecting a stagecoach to come along , and says , " You been used to the kind of country that just lays down and minds its manners . Well , I know prairies too . You can say what you like about prairies  --  " " I wish you could hear my pa when the wind and rain gets up , " I says . " But at least a prairie do n't raise all this commotion of bouldersp141and smashed-up-looking heaps of Nature bigger than the biggest thunderhead you ever seen . " He leant forward with his toes almost in the crick and looked upstream and motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leaning way out and peeking between the sides of the gully I could see the top of a mountain , white and jagged and gleaming in the sun . And I knew right off I was never going up anything like that . Kit was welcome to it . If that 's where they wanted to put gold , then somebody else could have it . Zack says , " There 's something wrong about a mountain . It looks like somebody went and made a mistake , and they did , all that heavingand jumbling and snow laying slantwise instead of nice and flat so 's you know where to put your foot down . And you can see what 's coming on a prairie . You may not be smart enough or strong enough to do nothing about it , but at least you can see it ahead of time and get set or get moving . " " Well , you do n't get no mirages up here anyways , " I says . " You get worse , " he says . " You get surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would n't be nothing much on a prairie . He 'd be ashamed of hisself out in the open like that , and you and him 'd take one good look at each other and say , Well , there 's some trouble I do n't happen to need . But on a dang slope on a narrow trail or with a bunch of pine trees getting in your road , you and him has got to figure out the do 's and don'ts and whys and wherefores right there on the spot up close right now . And I 'll tell you a little secret : he can do it better than you because if you do n't like what he decides , he do n't care . " " Reckon I 'll stay down here , " I says . He looked back toward his hut , and I did too : Staggs and Badger was both out watching him now , and he says , " They do n't much like you being here . " " I figured that out already , " I says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , nobody much has come sniffing around . There 's another sweet little stretch upstream about a mile and a half . Might be better than this , but I do n't think so . Hope not . Anyway , if we was to start washing enough color out of here , they 'd know it down along Cherry Crick , even if we kept still about it and did n't take none down for assay or minting . Do n't ask me how . Gold do n't just talk , it hollers and whistles . And if enough people started sluicing and long-tomming upstream , no tell/ing what kind of water we 'd be getting down here , if any . So if you stake a claim down in town , do n't go lying or bragging . " " I do n't do much of that , " I says . " Your brother 's pretty good at it . I 've heard better , but he 's pretty good . " Staggs and Badger was still watching , and Millie too , and I says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? " " Now right there you sounded like a Bender , all right , " he says . " Did I say anything that did n't sound like good advice ? " " No , sir . " His forehead had started going deep red like his nose , but it lightened up when he seen I was still friendly . " Then do n't bite the hand that 's feeding you a little up-country wisdom , boy . " He tipped his old fiat-topped felt hat toward Millie , who was a hundred foot off , waiting . " My respecks to Miz Bender , and if I can lighten the load of your youthful ignorance any further , just come a-running . " " It do n't shame me to ask questions , " I says . " Glad to hear it , " he says , and he started to back off , scuffing the side of one boot at the ground . " Do n't mind me . Been a long time since I seen a young man in love , and it keeps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says . He give me one of his gray-colored smiles then and squinted around and snuffed the air and says , " We 're in for a thaw . " He went bowlegging back to the hut , where the other two was still waiting . When I got near enough to Millie with the pan , before I could say a word , she says , " Do n't be too disappointed . " And her smile was a different color altogether . " I do n't expect nothing but the best , " I says . " Makes the worst more interesting when it shows up . " Millie put our two cents ' worth of grit ( I exaggerated a bit ) in a tin can she 'd picked up on the road and been saving for something or other , but instead of panning any more right away , I took it into my head to expand our lean-to so 's it was more like a house . There was two more pine trees pretty close behind us , and I figured I could run crosspoles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , and we 'd be right comfortable if I could find something to wall it up with . It was going to be lob-sided because the trees wasn'tp143the same distance apart , but she liked the idea and helped strip the aspen poles as fast as I cut them . While we was working , Mr. Blue come back , weaving downhill among the trees like he 'd been living in the neighborhood for years . He must of found plenty to eat because he would n't take no more'n a handful of oats from Millie , and then he hung around watching us work for a spell , probably thinking we 'd slap that pack on his back again any minute and get in our customary day of hauling and wheelborrowing . But in a half-hour he seen something new was going on , and in forty-five minutes he begun to get restless about it . " Do you think I should tie him to a tree so he can figure out this is his home ? " Millie says . But I did n't want to wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor nobody else 's neither ) , so I says , " Let 's leave him make up his own mind , " which we done , and by the time an hour was up , he seemed to get it all straight in his head and went back zigzagging up the slope the way he come . I run out of nails about the same time I got tired of chopping and sawing , but we had the framework up anyway , leaving the lean-to kind of inside it so 's we 'd have a dry place if it snowed before we was done . But by midday it was halfway warm and felt about like it had back on our farm , and I seen Zack and Badger and Staggs , sometimes separate , sometimes together , walking and scuffing along the crickbank and talking , and once Badger brung out a pickax and tried to drive it into the ground and then stood there rubbing his hands and squinching over like he 'd near broke his wrists . So it looked like the Collywobble Mining Company was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them give me the budge I needed , and after we 'd et ( the sight of beans all swole up from hours of soaking and then boiling was getting to be enough to fill me up without me going to the trouble of chewing and swallering ) I got out my forty foot of welldigging rope and went down to the near stake of Kit 's claim and commenced measuring off our claim , which I reckoned to be two and a half ropes , the hard part being I could n't go more'n twenty foot without wading , clinging on to the sheer bank , or going gulch climbing thirty or forty foot up on the bare , steep , hard , slippery , red-and-brown-streaked dirt without no handholds , and since Millie would n't let me try the last one and I could n't do the middle one , I decided to go wading.  | " You 'll ruin your boots , " she says . " Then I 'll wade barefoot . " " You 're going to freeze your feet off in that water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks , " I says . " Both pair . " " You 'll fall down on those slick stones and drown , " she says . " Ca n't you just estimate a hundred feet ? " " No man alive can spit that far , " I says . Women get funny notions when they take to worrying . " And I ca n't drown in a foot of water . Next week it might be five foot deep . " I seen her trying to be patient with me , which is a good idea when two stubborn people try to mend each other 's ways . " If that 's the case , where 's your stake going to be then , Mr. Bender ? " she says . " Who 's going to see it or read it under water ? " " I just want to do it legal , " I says , but I did n't have no good answerexcept to say , " I 'll drive it in as high up as I can reach . " I had fixed up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millie 's letter paper stuck in one split end and already glued in tight by the resin and had the pencil stub already sharpened and licked and set to go , down on my knees , using our hearthstone like a desk . But she says , " What exactly is a claim notice supposed to say ? " " I do n't know , " I says , kneeling there and feeling like a mortal jughead . " I forgot to ask . " So there was n't nothing to do but go ask Zack . I stayed off from the hut and give him a holler , and all three of them stuck their head from around back where I 'd seen the sluice boxes stacking up . They jawed at each other a minute , and then Zack come down to the crickbank and says , " What is it , boy ? " " What 's sposed to be wrote on a claim notice ? " I says . He glanced back over his shoulder . " They do n't like me helping you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wisht I had some thaw so 's I could spit proper . Your claim 's Number Five Upstream of Collywobble Discovery . Sign it , date it , give it a fancy name if you feel like . " Again , he glanced back at Staggs and Badger , who was standing , staring , too far off to hear . " I 'd sooner be upstreamof the likes of them myself , but you ca n't make nothing out of this kind of placer gold without a company . When we get the long tom set up and going and they start busting their backs over it and maybe only making a little money , they might ask you in as a pardner , boy , specially if you got a little dirt and some quicksilver to add on . "  | " I 'll see what Kit wants me to do , " I says . " You do n't act much like him . " Zack give hisself a good scratch up under the sheepskin . " And that 's a step in the right direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family , they 're all mean . " " Maybe I 'm mean too , " I says , starting back , " and too dumb to know it . " He give a cough or a cackle at that , then all of a sudden commencedjumping up and down , pounding his boot heels on the hard ground , and I stopped still , thinking he was having a fit or had got roostered up with whiskey , and in a loud voice he says , " Thaw , damn you , thaw ! I 'm tired of waiting on a bunch of dirt that do n't know enough to reckonize springtime . " He swept his arms out and ran his eyes back and forth along the whole crickbank . " No use pretendingyou 're solid rock , goddamn you ! You 're going to get dug and ditched and washed down and tailed off , and we 're going to pull them gold teeth right out of you . " I seen Staggs coming , but Zack did n't and went right on : " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , why , we do n't give a damn , do we , boy ? " Meaning me , so I says , " No , sir . " " We 'll just go dig someplace else . " " Come on , cut out all this booming and help us put the riffle box together , " Staggs says , giving me a tight-eyed look . " I 'm just giving this claim fair warning , " Zack says . " You 're so full of bullshit , you should take to farming , " Staggs says . " Never have to buy no manure . " " Keep on my good side , Staggs , " Zack says . " Pretty soon somebody'sgoing to have to know what he 's doing around here and know what he 's looking at and know what to look for next , and I do n't see nobody like that but me in this neighborhood . " " Then come on , use that big old self-rising brain on this riffle box , " Staggs says . " You 're a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm after yours . And I 'll have it too , someday , Staggs . I 'll have it broiled on the end of a willow switch . " I seen Staggs trying to hold his temper down . He says , " Some folks would eat most anything . Why do n't you eat this dirt and shit us some nuggets ? " Zack seemed like he was all churned up , and one eye had commencedwandering off sideways . " I 've et things I ca n't believe now ,  |p146and  I 've et things I ca n't even remember because I worked so hard to get them out of my head . " " Jesus B. Christ , do n't start telling stories , " Staggs says . " How the hell did we ever get through the winter without killing each other off ? " I drifted further away , and Zack started up the slope with Staggs . " We did kill each other off , " Zack says . " We 're just too ornery to fall down . " I went about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy ! Boy ! " He 'd cupped his hands to make it carry good , and Staggs was standing by , watching him , looking worried . " What do you want with gold anyway , boy ? " Zack yells , and did n't give me no time to think up an answer , but went right on , " What do they do with it ? Make watches and knobs for canes and teeth and wedding rings and braid for admirals and generals . Want to risk your life for any of them things ? For a rich man 's toothpick ? " Staggs hauled on his arm , and they went behind the hut . Millie wrote down what Zack had told me ( she can do pretty curlicue printing most as good as a sign painter ) , and we both wrote our name at the bottom and called it Hearthstone Mining Company . And after arguing a bit more , I done what she suggested : put the stake in as far upstream as I could reach without getting wet , with an arrow along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This Sign Belongs75 More Foot Upstream But We Ca n't Get There , " which was spored to keep everything fair and square , and I hoped so . I had to pickax a little hole for the stake and wedge some gravel in to hold it up , but finally it was all done , and we stood back proud and looked at it every which way and felt like we had at the christeningof my wheelbarrow , only better . Then we went wandering up along the steep , bare gullyside above the crick , picking up little pieces of rock and staring around at the view and scaring me some because there was n't no good footholdsout there , but Millie was sure-footed as Mr. Blue and I was getting used to all this slipshoddy country , and while we was standing there , feeling like our own landlords , I seen Badger and Staggs come out of their hut and down near the crick , Badger flapping his deerskin around like a dog worrying a blanket , and then Zack come out and did a dance too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then Millie and me felt it too : a warm wind coming up thep147draw from the bottom land . It must of had to take as many zigzags as my wheelbarrow to get up here to us , but now it was blowing in our face , as warm as a stove almost , and you could feel the melt starting in every dead inch of this little crank turn of a gulch , even up at our end , as sure as morning.  |p148Mr  . Blue showed up again soon after dawn to make sure he had n't made no mistake , and he had , because Millie was waiting for him with a saddle she 'd folded up out of a blanket , and after she 'd tied it on and give it a try side-saddle to see if he 'd buck or run and he did n't do neither , we was ready to head for town . I had strung my pickax , shovel , and whipsaw together and lashed them halfway up a thick pine tree fifty yards up the slope from our house and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wheelbarrow light , taking my ax along for kindling and comfort . We had figured to bring the wheelbarrow to sleep under , since it would take us more'n half the day to get there and probably moretime to file the claim and Millie wanted to shop if there was anything to shop and , besides , I did n't feel right walking very far withoutthem handles pulling down on my arms . It sort of kept me balancedand springy-footed . And I did n't want Staggs or Badgerwrecking it or stomping it for spite . Millie left most of our kit behind but for a little food already cooked , so we both felt light as goosefeathers ( though I brung the crock of quicksilver along to keep it from straying off ) , and we felt cheery and loose in our bones , and I give Staggs a smile and a howdy when we passed by the front of the hut  |p149He  was splitting small logs into some rough kind of lumber , and he looked up , sweating and slope-shouldered and thick-set like he belonged inside the bearskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 're getting some sense . Tell the folks back home it 's all a swindle . " " See you tomorrow , " I says , which did n't seem like what he 'd reckoned on hearing , because he scowled . Zack come around the side of the house carrying the front end of a double-bottomed box like a coffin without no lid and Badger on the rear end , and I says , " Can we bring anything from town , Mr. Orfrey ? " " Do n't bring back nothing , " Staggs says . " And nobody . Keep your mouth shut about this crick . Tell them you 're homesteaders . " " If there 's such a thing as a plug of chaw laying around free , I 'd sure admire it , " Zack says . Walking downhill beats walking up in just about every way you can name . It 's mighty strange to get help walking , to find out your foot 's going a little further each step than you thought it would and there 's no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue did n't seem to mind being rode , and Millie took to riding like she done everything else ( she had n't complained none on the way , but many 's the night back on the road I seen her holding a bare foot in her hands and rocking back and forth with it like it was a sick babydoll , and nothing I could do about it ) , and even though the day had n't stayed as warm as that one patch of evening had been , everything was commencing to thaw . She sang and whistled and learnt me a song about " Green grow the rashes 0 , " which sounded kind of ugly till she explained it was some kind of grass instead of the itch , and we had a grand time , making more commotion in that crooked , steep little Slab Crick valley than it had ever heard before unless the Injuns had warpathedit there sometime . I do n't know what made us so happy : we had n't washed but two cents ' worth of gold , if that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep us in supplies ( I still had n't had the courage to ask her how much she had ) , and we did n't have nothing to depend on in this world but us , which seemed like enough . There was a few more tents sprung up on the lower stretches and men out panning or using rockers about the size of washtubs ,
