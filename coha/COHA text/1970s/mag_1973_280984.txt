Pistol shots crackled one afternoon last week in Dearborn , the Detroit suburb that is home to the Ford Motor Co. ' s sprawling Rouge plant and to the United Auto Workers ' 34,000-man Local 600 . William Harrell , a skilled millwright , was shot in the backside by a man whom bystanders identified as an officer of Harrell 's own local . The two men had been on opposing sides of a bitter internal battle over the U.A.W. 's newly negotiated contract with Ford . On one side are the union 's skilled tradesmen-the tool-and diemakers , electricians , mechanics , millwrights and repairmen . On the other side stand the union 's leadership and the unskilled and semiskilled production workers . <P> The shooting was the most serious skirmish , but hardly the only one , since the agreement was reached with Ford three weeks ago . The tradesmen have argued with their officers , fists have flown , and skilled union workers have picketed Solidarity House , the U.A.W. 's international headquarters . The fighting centered on the major issue in this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's workers have demanded , and won , the right to refuse extra working hours . Ford negotiators , worried that a refusal by skilled tradesmen to work overtime might tie up their plants , bargained a key clause into the contract . The clause permits management to meet the tradesmen 's refusals to work by filling the gaps with unskilled workers and part-timers , or by jobbing the work out to nonunion shops . To the tradesmen , some of whom earn well over $20,000 a year , the threat of replacement by unskilled or nonunion workers was a challenge to their status and , in the long run , to their job security . " It hit us right where it hurts , " said an angry electrician . " You ca n't tell me any production worker can come in and do my job . " <P> Major Turn Down . The tradesmen damned the contract as a sellout , and they urged the rank and file to reject it . Ignoring that call , the regular production workers voted in favor , 119,925 to 38,684 . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of a contract dealing specifically with them , and they voted against the agreement 20,089 to 5,943 . Never before had a contract recommended by U.A.W. negotiators been turned down by a major constituency . <P> After agonizing over the vote for three days , U.A.W. President Leonard Woodcock announced that the contract had been ratified , but that he would go back to renegotiate the disputed clause . Ford officials , he said , are " sensible people who will sit down and work out a solution . " Ford 's chief negotiator , Malcolm Denise , seeing his respected adversary on the spot , agreed to settle their grievance . <P> This was not the first time that the U.A.W. tradesmen had been rebellious . They began agitating for special treatment in the late 1950s , threatening to defect to other unions or to form their own . By letting them veto parts of the contract , union chiefs put down the insurrection , though uprisings still occur and probably will continue to do so .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
