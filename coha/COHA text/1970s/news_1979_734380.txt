txt A wave of speculation swept into the world bullion markets today , carrying prices for gold and silver to new peaks in heavy trading that some dealers called chaotic at times . The price increases for both metals were far greater than any gains ever previously recorded , reflecting intense buying pressure . Traders said the surge was not based on any economic fundamentals but appeared to be inspired by sheer speculation . " It 's really a casino , " one stunned dealer in London said . " There 's no possible justification for the recent advances . " Another described the market as " absolutely wild . " Temporarily No Sellers Trading in gold was so hectic and prices so volatile that at one point there was said to be no quotation because dealers were too busy trying to sort out their positions . The lack of a quotation meant there were temporarily no sellers in the market , only would-be buyers . Gold was quoted at a record $375.75 an ounce at the afternoon fixing in London , up $20.25 from yesterday afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before closing at $372 , up $16.50 from Monday 's closing price . In Zurich , gold climbed $20.50 an ounce to $373.50 at the close . Until today , gold had gained as much as $10 an ounce only twice before , yesterday and last Friday . Gold rose even more sharply in Washington at the Treasury 's monthly auction , where the bids averaged $377.78 an ounce for the 750,000 ounces for sale . This was up $76.70 from the average of $301.08 at the August sale . The Treasury received bids for four times as much gold as it offered . Page D7 . The performance of silver was even more spectacular , with the London fixing set at $18.30 an ounce , up more than 30 percent from last night 's levels . Dealers reported that demand for gold was spilling over into the silver market on the theory that silver had advanced relatively less and therefore held more potential . Behind the excitement lay doubts about currency values , rising inflation in major countries , buying by Middle Eastern interests , panic covering of short positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old-fashioned speculative boom that was unrelated to any of the traditional justifications for buying bullion . Some dealers said they thought the gold price , at least , had reached an absurd level and would soon flatten out or fall . " We may have reached the point when people are going to say ' enough is enough , that 's about it , chaps , ' " one said . But another man closely involved in the fixings here said as he viewed the auction results that " it hardly looks as though it will be a weak market tomorrow . " Bullion prices are " fixed " twice daily here and in Zurich in an effort to balance the forces of supply and demand . One measure of today 's near disarray in the markets was the fact that the spreads between bid and offered prices became yawning chasms . Gold , which in normal activity at lower prices would be quoted at spreads of 50 cents to $1 an ounce , had spreads at times of $4 or $5 . Spreads in the silver market were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity here and elsewhere in Europe reflected business diverted from the United States . American futures markets quickly moved up by the maximum amounts allowed by regulatory authorities , so little trading was done for lack of sellers . The volume of gold trading in London , which is thought to be surpassed only in Zurich , is impossible to gauge since the five dealing firms that fix the price at N.M . Rothschild &; Sons each day do not disclose their volume . " We do n't ? go in for full disclosure in this country , " a senior official of one member of the group said . " It 's never been required so we do n't do it . " When pressed he said " a few tons " of gold went through the London fixings today . Rumors of all kinds swept through today 's frenzied markets . According to one , a big operator had been caught short by selling gold at current prices with the expectation of buying it back at lower prices . When the price kept rising , he was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , absorbing large losses as he did so . Another story was that Americans had plunged in because they anticipated some unnamed political problem not yet visible to the rest of the world . Gold is traditionally considered a safe parking place for investment funds at times of political uncertainty . Price Termed ' Vulnerable ' Traders generally seemed at a loss to predict what would happen next to prices . Like currencies , gold is traded almost continuously as dealers pass positions to colleagues in time zones to the west . But in light of the large profits piled up recently and with the short-sellers forced to cover their positions , one trader said , " In normal market terms you would consider the price quite vulnerable . " Meanwhile , the London Metal Exchange , which last week denied that it was considering adding gold futures contracts to its existing seven metals contracts , announced today that it had appointed a committee to study the matter . Trading in futures involves buying and selling contracts for specific amounts of a commodity at set prices within a certain time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush would require Bank of England approval and perhaps legislation as well . But the exchange is believed to have specific contracts firmly in mind with hopes of beginning by early next year . Contracts on the exchange , which has traded silver since 1968 , have no limits to daily price swings and would presumably offer a ready " safety valve " in gold as well for American players unable to trade when prices reach the daily limits imposed by the commodity exchanges in the United States as a safety measure .
