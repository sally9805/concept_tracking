PART I ELL ME , " said King Arthur happily , for these high matters seemed to be taking him far from Mordred and Lancelot , " what conclusions the committee has come to , for I am sure you have been discussing it , about the human animal ? " " We have found ourselves in difficulty about the name . " " What name ? " " Homo sapiens , " explained the grass snake . " It became obvious that sapiens was hopeless as an adjective , but the trouble was to find another . " Archimedes said : " Do you remember that Merlyn once told you why the chaffinch was called coelebs ? A good adjective for a species has to be appropriate to some peculiarity of it , like that . " " The first suggestion , " said Merlyn , " was naturally ferox , since man is the most ferocious of the animals . " " It is strange that you should mention ferox . I was thinking that very word an hour ago . But you are exaggerating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocious than a tiger . " " Am I ? " " I have always found that men were decent on the whole ... " Merlyn took off his spectacles , sighed deeply , polish , them , put them on again , and examined his disciple wi curiosity : as if he might at any moment begin to grc some long , soft , furry ears . " Try to remember the last time you went for a walk he suggested mildly . " A walk ? " " Yes , a walk in the English country lanes . Here corn Homo sapiens , taking his pleasure in the cool of the e ' . ning . Picture the scene , Here is a blackbird singing the bush . Does it fall silent and fly away with a curs ? Not a bit of it . It sings all the louder and perches on shoulder . Here is a rabbit nibbling the short grass . Do it rush in terror towards its burrow ? Not at all . It ho towards him . Here are field mouse , grass snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they conceal themselves , or accept presence ? " Why , " cried the old fellow suddenly , flaming out wi a peculiar , ancient indignation . " there is not a humble a imal in England that does not flee from the shadow of ma as a burnt soul from purgatory . Not a mammal , not a not a bird . Extend your walk so that it passes by a riv ? bank , and the very fish will dart away . It takes something believe me , to be dreaded in all the elements there are . " And do not , " he added quickly , laying his hand Arthur 's knee , " do not imagine that they fly from t presence of one another . if a fox walked down the lam perhaps the rabbit would scuttle : but the bird in the tr and the rest of them would agree to his being . If a hat swung by , perhaps the blackbird would cower : but t saMIIII  --  assios es and the others would allow its arrival . Only man , on-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Animals , only he is dreaded by every living Ling . " " But these animals are not what you could really call ild . A tiger , for instance ... " Merlyn stopped him with his hand again . " Let the walk be in the Darkest Indies , " he said , " if ni like . There is not a tiger , not a cobra , not an elesant in the Afric jungle , but what he flies from man . few tigers who have gone mad from toothache will atck him , and the cobra , if hard pressed , will fight in lf-defense . But if a sane man meets a sane tiger on a ngle path , it is the tiger who will turn aside . The only iimals which do not run from man are those which have ! ver seen him , the seals , penguins , dodos , or whales of e Arctic seas , and these , in consequence , are immediate . reduced to the verge of extinction . Even the few creares which prey on man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their host , and keep a arp lookout to be beyond his fingers . " Homo ferox , " continued Merlyn , shaking his head , hat rarity in nature , an animal which will kill for plea-re ! There is not a beast in this room who would not orn to kill , except for a meal . Man affects to feel indigtion at the shrike , who keeps a small larder of snails 2. speared on thorns : yet his own well-stocked larder is rrounded by herds of charming creatures like the moon-g bullock , and the sheep with its intelligent and sensitive who are kept solely in order to be slaughtered on verge of maturity and devoured by their carnivorous rder , whose teeth are not even designed for those of a rnivore . You should read Lamb 's letter to Southey , out baking moles alive , and sport with cockchafers , and is in bladders , and crimping skates , and anglers , those eek inflictors of pangs intolerable . ' Homo ferox , the ventor of Cruelty to Animals , who will rear pheasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 go to the trouble of training other animals to kill : to will burn living rats , as I have seen done in Eriu , in der that their shrieks may intimidate the local rodents : to will forcibly degenerate the livers of domestic geese , order to make himself a tasty food : who will saw the awing horns off cattle , for convenience in transport : Lo will blind goldfinches with a needle , to make them ig : who will boil lobsters and shrimps alive , although hears their piping screams : who will turn on his own sties in war , and kill nineteen million every hundred srs : who will publicly murder his fellow men when he s adjudged them to be criminals : and who has inited a way of torturing his own children with a stick , of exporting them to concentration camps called Schools , ere the torture can be applied by proxy ... Yes , you are ; ht to ask whether man can properly be described as ox , for certainly the word in its natural meaning of wild among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creature . ' Goodness , " said the king . " You seem to lay it on . " But the old magician would not be appeased . ' The reason , " he said , " why we felt doubts about us-ing ferox was that Archimedes suggested that stultus would be more appropriate . " " Stuitus ? I thought we were intelligent ? " " In one of the miserable wars when I was a younger man , " said the magician , taking a deep breath , it was found necessary to issue to the people of England a set of printed cards which entitled them to food . These cards had to be filled in by hand , before the food could be bought . Each individual had to write a number in one part of the card , his name in another part , and the name of the food-supplier in a third . He had to perform these three intellectual feats  --  one number and two names  --  or else he would get no food and starve to death . His life depended on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I recollect , that two-thirds of the population were unable to perform the sequence without mistake . And these people , we are told by the Catholic Church , are to be trusted with immortal souls ! " " Are you sure of the facts ? " asked the badger doubtfully . The old man had the grace to blush . " 1 did not note them down , " he said , " but they are true in substance , if not in detail . I clearly remember , for instance , that a woman was found standing in a queue for birdseed in the same war , who , upon interrogation , was discovered to possess no birds . " Arthur objected . " It does not prove very much , even if they were unable to write their three things properly . if they had been any of the other animals , they would not have been able to write at all . " " The short answer to that , " replied the philosopher , " is that not a single human being can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " 1 do not understand . " Well , the insect called Balaninus elephas is able to bore acorns in the way I mention , but it can not write . Man can write , but can not bore acorns . These are their own specializations . The important difference is , however , that while Balaninus bores his holes with the greatest efficiency , man , as I have shown you , does not write with any efficiency at all . That is why I say that , species for species , man is more inefficient , more stultus , than his fellow beasts . Indeed , no sensible observer would expect the contrary . Man has been so short a time upon our globe that he can scarcely be expected to have mastered much . " The king had found that he was beginning to feel depressed . " Did vou think of many other names ? " he asked . " There was a third suggestion , made by Badger . " At this the happy badger shuffled his feet with satisfaction , peeped sideways at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long nails . " Impoliticus , " said Merlyn . " Homo impoliticus . You remember that Aristotle defined us as political animals . Badger suggested examining this , and , after we had looked at his politics , impoliticus seemed to be the only word to use . " " Go on , if you must . " " We found that the political ideas of Homo ferox were of two kinds : either that problems could be solved by force , or that they could be solved by argument . The ant-men of the future , who believe in force , consider that you can determine whether twice two is four by knocking people down who disagree with you . The democrats , who believe in argument , consider that all men are entitled to an opinion , because all are born equal-1 am as good a man as you are , ' the first instinctive ejaculation of the man who is not . " " If neither force nor argument can be relied on . " said the king , " I do not see what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor opinion , " said Merlyn with the deepest sincerity , " is thinking . Argument is only a display of mental force , a sort of fencing with points in order to gain a victory , not for truth . Opinions are the blind alleys of lazy or of stupid men , who are unable to think . If ever a true politician really thinks a subject out dispassionately , even Homo stultus will be compelled to accept his findings in the end . Opinion can never stand beside truth . At present , however , Homo impoliticus is content either to argue with opinions or to fight with his fists , instead of waiting for the truth in his head . It will take a million years before the mass of men can be called political animals . " " What are we , then , at present ? " " We find that at present the human race is divided politically into one wise man . nine knaves , and ninety fools out of every hundred . That is , by an optimistic observer . The nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them , and become ' politicians ' : the wise man stands out , because he knows himself to be hopelessly outnumbered , and devotes himself to poetry , mathematics , or philosophy ; while the ninety fools plod off behind the banners of the nine villains , according to fancy . into the labyrinths of chicanery , malice , and warfare . It is pleasant to have command , observes Sancho Panza , even over a flock of sheep , and that is why thepoliticians raise their banners . It is , moreover , the sam thing for the sheep whatever the banner . If it is demo ( racy , then the nine knaves will become members of pal liament ; if fascism , they will become party leaders ; i communism , commissars . Nothing will be different , excer the name . The fools will be still fools , the knaves sti leaders , the result still exploitation . As for the wise mar his lot will be much the same under any ideology . Uncle democracy he will be encouraged to starve to death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentratio camp , under communism he will be liquidated . This is a optimistic but on the whole a scientific statement of di habits of Homo impoliticus . " The king said grimly : " Well , I am sorry . I suppose had better go away and drown myself . I am cheeky , mail nificant , ferocious , stupid , and impolitic . It hardly seem to be worth our going on . " But at this the animals seemed much upset . They ros in a body , stood round him . fanned him , and offere him drink . " No , " they said . " Really , we were not trying to be null Honestly , we were trying to help . There , do not take it t heart . We are sure there must be plenty of humans wh are sapiens. and not a bit ferocious . We were telling yo these things as a sort of foundation , so as to make it easie to solve your puzzle later . Come now , have a glass of M ; deira and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma is the most marvelous creature anywhere , quite the be there is . " And they turned upon Merlyn crossly , saying : " No look what you have done ! This is the result of all you jibber and jabber ! The poor king is perfectly miserabl and all because you throw your weight about , and exa gerate , and prattle like a poop ! " Merlyn only replied : " Even the Greek definition at thropos , He Who Looks Up , is inaccurate . Man seldoi looks above his own height after adolescence . " PART II clan , al-mg had can be-with the eginning se , " said king un-sugges- , ense . He was say-to forge ) egan the ip in the ..

It must assault and sk of wolves be between rimers or  --  sne stone on locusts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herrings that is , fish of one species preying upon fish of anter  --  none of these are true examples of war . Thus we that there are two essentials : that the combatants should be of the one family , and that they should be of a gregarious family . We can therefore begin by dismissing all animals which are not gregarious , before we search for examples of warfare in nature . Having done that , we find ourselves left with large numbers of animals such as starlings , minnows , rabbits , bees , and thousands of others . Upon beginning our search for warfare among these , however , we find a dearth of examples . How many animals can you think of which take concerted aggressive action against groups of their own species ? " Merlyn waited two seconds for the old man to answer , and continued with his lecture . " Exactly . You were about to mention a few insects , man , various microbes or blood corpuscles  --  if these can be said to be of the same species  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immorality of warfare is , as I mentioned before , an oddity in nature . We sit down , therefore , relieved by this fortunate coincidence of a bundle of data which might have proved too bulky , and we examine the special peculiarities of those species which do engage in hostilities . What do we find ? Do we find , as Badger 's famous communists would postulate , that it is the species which owns individual property that fights ? On the contrary , we find that the warfaring animals are the very ones which tend to limit or to banish individual possessions . It is the ants and bees , with their command stomachs and territories , and the men , with their national property , who slit each other 's throats ; while it is the birds , with their private wives , nests , and hunting grounds , the rabbits with their own burrows and stomachs , the minnows with their individual homesteads , and the lyrebirds with their personal treasure houses and ornamental pleasure grounds , who remain at peace . You must not despise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are as much a form of property to the animals as a home and business is to man . And the important thing is that they are private property . The owners of private property in nature are pacific , while those who have invented public property go to war . This , you will observe , is exactly the opposite of the totalist doctrine . " Of course , the owners of private property in nature are sometimes forced to defend their holdings against piracy by other individuals . This rarely results in bloodshed , and men themselves need not fear it , because our king has already persuaded them to adopt the principle of a police force . " But you want to object that perhaps the link which binds the warfaring animals together is not the link of na-tionalism : perhaps they go to war for other reasons  --  because they are all manufacturers , or all owners of domestic animals , or all agriculturalists like some of the ants , or because they all have stores of food . I need not trouble you with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Spiders are the greatest of manufacturers , yet do no battle : bees have no domestic animals or agriculture , yet go to war : many ants who are belligerent have no stores of food . By some such mental process as this , as in finding out the Highest Common Factor in mathematics , you will end with the explanation I have offered : an explanation which is , indeed , self-evident when you come to look at it . War is due to communal property , the very thing advocated by nearly all the demagogues who peddle what they call a New Order . " I have outrun my examples . We must return to the concrete instances , to examine the case . Let us look at a rookery . " Here is a gregarious animal like the ant , which lives together with its comrades in airy communities . The rookery is conscious of its nationalism to the extent that it will molest other rooks , from distant congeries , if they attempt to build in its own trees . The rook is not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it does not make any claim to national property in its feeding grounds , Any adjacent field that is rich in seed or worms will be frequented not only by the rooks of this community but also by those of all nearby communities , and . indeed , by the jackdaws and pigeons of the neighborhood , without the outbreak of hostilities . The rooks , in fact , do not claim national property except to the minor extent of their nesting site , and the result is that they are free from the scourge of war . They agree to the obvious natural truth . that access to raw materials must be free to private enterprise . " Then turn to the geese : one of the oldest races , one of the most cultured , one of the best supplied with language . Admirable musicians and poets , masters of the air for millions of years without ever having dropped a bomb , monogamous , disciplined , intelligent , gregarious , moral , responsible , we find them adamant in their belief that the natural resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or family of their tribe . If there is a good bed of Zostera marina or a good field of stubble , there may be two hundred geese on it today , ten thousand tomorrow . In one skein of geese which is moving from feeding ground to nesting place , we may find white-fronts mingled with pink-feet or greylags or even with the bernicles . The world is free to all . Yet do not suppose that they are communists . Each individual goose is prepared to assault his neighbor for the possession of a rotten potato , while their wives and nests are strictly private . They have no communal home or stomach , like the ants . And these beautiful creatures , who migrate freely over the whole surface of the globe without making claim to any part of it , have never fought a war . " It is nationalism , the claims of small communities to parts of the indifferent earth as communal property , which is the curse of man . The petty and driveling advocates a Irish or Polish nationalism : these are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fight a major war oster sibly for ' the rights of small nations , ' while erecting monument to a woman who was martyred for the remar that patriotism was not good enough , these people ca only be regarded as a collection of benevolent imbecile conducted by bemused crooks . Nor is it fair to pick o the English or the Trish or the Poles . All of us are in i It is the general idiocy of Homo impoliticus . Aye , an when I speak rudely of the English in this particular , would like to add at once that I %aye lived among ther during several centuries . Even if they are a collection c imbecile crooks , they are at least bemused and benevoler about it , which I can not help thinking is preferable to di tyrannous and cynical stupidity of the Huns who figl against them . Make no mistake about that . " " And what , " asked the badger politely , " is the practic ; solution ? " " The simplest and easiest in the world . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immigr ; tion laws , converting mankind into a federation of ind viduals . In fact , you must abolish nations , and not on nations but states also ; indeed , you must tolerate no an larger than the family .

That the ii dividuals should be turned into communis .....  --  " ' or anything else is quite unnecessary , his , ever , and it is against the laws of nature . I / ' the course of a thousand years we shout hope to have a common language if we wei lucky , but the main thing is that we mu make it possible for a man living at Ston henge to pack up his traps overnight and to seek his fo tune without hindrance in Timbuktu ...

" " Fudge . It would raise the coolie 's standard of livin If he is as good a man as you are in open competitio or a better one , good luck to him . He is the man we war As for civilization , look at it . " " It would mean an economic revolution ! " " Would you rather have a series of Armageddon Nothing of value was ever yet got in this world , my ba ger , without being paid for . " " Certainly , " agreed the badger suddenly , " it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . Leave man to his petty tragedy , f he prefers to embrace it , and look about you at two undred and fifty thousand other animals . They . at any ate , with a few trifling exceptions , have political sense . t is a straight choice between the ant and the goose . and 11 our king will need to do , when he returns home , will , e to make their situation obvious . " The badger , who was a faithful opponent to all kinds f exaggeration , objected strongly . " Surely , " he said , " this is a piece of muddled thinking , ) say that man may choose between the ants and the eese ? In the first place man can be neither , and second- as we know , the ants are not unhappy as themselves . " Merlyn covered his argument at once . " I should not have said so . It was a manner of speakig . Actually there are never more than two choices open ? a species : either to evolve along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquidated . The ants had to choose stween being ants or being extinct , and the geese had to loose between extinction and being geese . It is not that le ants are wrong while the geese are right . Antism is ght for ants and goosyness is right for geese . In the same ay , man will have to choose between being liquidated id being manly . And a great part of being manly lies in e intelligent solution of these very problems of force , hich we have been examining through the eyes of other eatures . That is what the king must try to make them e . " Archimedes coughed and said , " Excuse me , Master , but your backsight clear enough today , to tell us if he will eceed ? " Merlyn scratched his head and wiped his spectacles . " He will succeed in the end , " he said eventually . " That am certain of . Otherwise the race must perish like the merican wood-pigeons , who , I may add , were consideriy more numerous than the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen years at the end of the neteenth century . But whether it is to be this time or other is still obscure to me . The difficulty of living ckwards and thinking forwards is that you become consed about the present . It is also the reason why one efers to escape into the abstract . " The old gentleman folded his hands upon his stomach , fisted his feet at the fire , and , reflecting upon his own sdicament in Time , began to recite from one of his fa-rite authors . " ' I saw , ' " he quoted , " ' the histories of mortal men of my different races being enacted before my eyes ... figs and queens and emperors and republicans and pacians and plebeians swept in reverse order across my : w ... Time rushed backward in tremendous panorais . Great men died before they won their fame . Kings re deposed before they were crowned .

My moth-and ... melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into ilenetian Altino ; Hellas into inmerable migrations . Blows fell ; and then were struck . ' " In the silence which succeeded this impressive picture , goat returned to an earlier topic . " He is looking unhappy , " said he , " whatever you may say . " So they looked at the king for the first time since his return , and all fell silent . E WAS watching them with a feather from LyO-Iyok , his mate while among the geese , in his hand . He held it out unconsciously , his fragment of beauty . He kept them off with it , as if it were a weapon to hold them back . " I am not going , " he said . " You must find another ox to draw for you . Why have you brought me away ? Why should I die for man when you speak of him contemptuously yourselves ? For it would be death . It is all too true that people are ferocious and stupid . They have given me every sorrow but death . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dullard will understand and throw down his arms ? No , he will kill me for it : kill me as the ants would have killed an albino . " And Merlyn , " he cried . " I am afraid to die , because I have never had a chance to live ! I never had a life of my own , nor time for beauty , and I had just begun to find it . You shew me beauty , and snatch it from me . You move me like a piece at chess . Have you the right to take my soul and twist it into shapes , to rob a mind of its mind ? " Oh , animals , I have failed you , I know . I have betrayed your trust . But I can not face the collar again , because you have driven me into it too long . Why should I leave Lyeetyok ? I was never clever , but I was patient , and even patience goes . Nobody can bear it all his life . " They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His feeling of guilt and of love frustrated had made him wretched , so that now he had to rage in self-defense . " Yes , you are clever . You know the long words and how to juggle with them . if the sentence is a pretty one , you laugh and make it . But these are human souls you are cackling about , and it is my soul , the only one I have , which you have put in the index . And LyO-lyok had a soul . Who made you into gods to meddle with destiny , or set you over hearts to bid them come and go ? I will do this filthy work no longer ; I will trouble with your filthy plans no further ; I will go away into some quiet place with the goose-people , where I can die in peace . " His voice broke down into that of an old and miserable beggar , as he threw himself back in the chair , covering his eyes with his hands . The urchin was found to be standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purplish fingers clenched into tight fists , with a truculent nose questing for opposition , breath . ing heavily , hristling with dead twigs , small , indignant , vulgar , and flea-bitten , the hedgehog confronted the committee and faced them down .

" And he placed his body sturdily between them and his hero , prepared to knock the first man down who interfered . " Ar , " he said sarcastically . " A fine parcel of bougers , us do say . A fine picking o ' Bumtious Pilates , for to depose of Man . Cibble-gabble , gibble-gabble . But ding the mun as stirs is finger or us busts un 's bloudie neck .

" Arthur held out his hand for the urchin 's , who gave it reluctantly , after wiping it on the prickles of his back .

" Much obliged , us ' m sure . " When they had reached the top , he sat down puffing and the old man sat beside him to admire the view . It was England that came out slowly , as the late moo : rose : his royal realm of Gramarye . Stretched at his fee . she spread herself away into the remotest north , leanin towards the imagined Hebrides .

He began to love tlland under him with a fierce longing , not because it good or bad , but because it was : because of the sha ( ows of the corn stooks on a golden evening ; because tl sheep 's tails would rattle when they ran , and the lamb sucking , would revolve their tails in little eddies ; hecam the clouds in daylight would surge it into light and shad ( because the squadrons of green and golden plover , worr Lug in pasture fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wind ; because the smoke from horn steads was a blue beard straying into heaven ; because tl stars were brighter in puddles than in the sky ; becau : there were puddles , and leaky gutters , and dunghills wi poppies on them ; because the salmon in the rivers su denly leaped and fell ; because the chestnut buds , in ti balmy wind of spring , would jump out of their twigs Ill jacks-in-boxes , or like little spectres holding up gret hands to scare him ; because the jackdaws , building , wou hang in the air with branches in their mouths , more bea tiful than any ark-returning dove ; because , in the moo light there below , God 's greatest blessing to the world w stretched , the silver gift of sleep .

They had done someing horribly difficult in their ignorant innocence . which is not for themselves . He saw suddenly all the people who had accepted sacfice : learned men who had starved for truth , poets who d refused to compound in order to achieve success , parts who had swallowed their own love in order to let their ildren live , doctors and holy men who had died to help , lions of crusaders , generally stupid , who had been tchered for their stupidity  --  but who had meant well . That was it , to mean well ! He caught a glimpse of that traordinary faculty in man , that strange , altruistic , rare , d obstinate decency which will make writers or scients maintain their truths at the risk of death . Eppur si rove , Galileo was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in a position to burn him if he would go on th it , with his preposterous nonsense about the earth wing round the sun , but he was to continue with the dime assertion because there was something which he ued more than himself .

But here and re , oh so seldom , oh so rare , oh so glorious , there were se all the same who would face the rack , the executer , and even utter extinction , in the cause of something . ater than themselves . Truth , that strange thing , the jest Pilate 's . Many stupid young men had thought they were ng for it , and many would continue to die for it , per-is for a thousand years . They did not have to be right ) ut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough that y , the few and martyred , should establish a greatness , iing above the sum of all they ignorantly had . lut then again there came the wave of sorrow over him , thought of the man-child when he woke : the thought of t cruel and brutish majority , to whom the martyrs were h rare exceptions . It moves , for all that . How few and fully few the ones who would be ready to maintain it ! HE pale faces of the committee , hunched round the fire , turned towards the door in a single movement , and six pairs of guilty eyes were fastened on the king . But it was England who came in . There was no need to say anything , no need to explain : they could see it in his face . Then they were rising up , and coming towards him , and standing round him humbly . Merlyn , to his surprise , was an old man with hands which shook like leaves . He was blowing his nose very much indeed on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mice and frogs . The badger was weeping bitterly , and absent-mind-edly swatting each tear as it appeared on the end of his nose . Archimedes had turned his head completely back to front , to hide his shame . Cavan 's expression was of tor-ment . T. natrix had laid his head on the royal foot , with one clear tear in each nostril . And Balin 's nictitating membrane was going with the speed of the Morse code . " God save the king , " they said . " You may be seated . " So they sat down deferentially , after he had taken the first seat : a Privy Council . " We will be returning soon . " he said , " to our bright realm . Before we go , there are questions we must ask . In the first place , it has been said that there will be a man like John Ball , who is said to be a bad naturalist because he claims that men should live like ants . What is the objection to his claim ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a matter of natural morality , Sir . The committee suggests that it is moral for a species to specialize in its own specialty . An elephant must attend to its trunk , a giraffe or camelopard to its neck . It would be immoral for an elephant to fly , because it has no wings . The specialty of man , as much developed in him as the neck is in the camelopard , is his neopallium . This is the part of the brain which , instead of being devoted to instinct , is concerned with memory , deduction , and the forms of thought which result in recognition by the individual of his personality . Man 's topknot makes him conscious of himself as a separate being , which does not often happen in animals and savages , so that any form of pronounced collectivism in politics is contrary to the specialization of man . " This , by the way , " continued the old gentleman slowly , drawing a film over his eyes as if he were a weary , second-sighted vulture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over several tiresome centuries , waged my little war against might under all its forms , and it is why I have rightly or wrongly seduced others into waging it . It is why I once persuaded you , Sir , to regard the Games-Maniac with contempt : to oppose your wisdom against the baton of Fort Mayne : to believe in justice rather than in power : and to investigate with mental in-tegrity , as we have tried to do this long-drawn evening , the causes of the battle we are waging : for war is force unbridled , at a gallop . I have not engaged in this crusade because the fact of force can be considered wrong , in an abstract sense . For the boa constrictor , who is practically one enormous muscle . it would be literally true to say that Might is Right : for the ant , whose brain is not constituted like the human brain , it is literally true that the State is more important than the Individual . But for man , whose specialty lies in the personality-recognizing creases of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the boa constrictor  --  it is equally true to say that mental truth , not force , is right : and that the Individual is more important than the State . He is so much more important that he should abolish it . We must leave the boa constrictors to admire themselves for being muscular athletes . We must leave the ants to assert the glory of the state : totalitarianism is their line of country , no doubt . But for man , and not on an abstract definition of right and wrong , but on nature 's concrete definition that a species must specialize in its own specialty , the committee suggests that might was never right : that the state never excelled the individual : and that the future lies with the personal soul . " " Perhaps you ought to speak about the brain . " " Sir , there are a great many things going on in this old brain-box ; but for the purposes of our investigation we confine ourselves to two compartments , the neopallium and the corpus striatum . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical actions are determined : in the former I keep that reason in honor of which our race has curiously been nicknamed sapiens . Perhaps I can explain it with one of those dangerous and often misleading similes . The corpus striatum is like a single mirror , which reflects instinctive actions outwards , in return for the stimuli which come in . In the neopallium , however , there are two mirrors . They can see each other , and for that reason they know that they exist . Man , know thyself , said somebody or other : or , as another philosopher had put it , the proper study of mankind is man . This is because he has specialized in the neopallium . In brainy animals other than man , the emphasis is not on the double-mirrored room , but on the single one . Few animals , except man , are conscious of their own personality . Even in primitive races of the human family there still exists a confusion between the individual and his surroundings  --  for the savage Indian , as you may know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he himself will spit , if he wants the clouds to rain . The ant 's nervous system may be said to be a single mirror like the savage 's , and that is why it suits the ant to be a communist , to lose himself in a crowd . But it is because civilized man 's brain is a double mirror that he will always have to specialize in individuality , in recognition of himself , or whatever you may like to call it : it is because of the two mirrors reflecting each other that he can never wholly succeed as an unselfish member of the proletariat . He must have a self and all that goes with a self so highly developed  --  including selfishness and prof erty . Pray forgive my simile , if I have seemed to use i unfairly . " " Has the goose a neopallium ? " Merlyn stood up again . " Yes , a fairly good one for a bird . The ants have a dii ferent form of nervous system , on the lines of the corpor striata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been silt gested that we ought to abolish it , in one way or anothei but nobody has given it the chance to speak for itsel Perhaps there is something to be said in favor of wa We would like to be told . " Merlyn put his hat on the floor and whispered to badger , who , after scuttling off to his pile of agenda , ma turned , to the wonder of all , with the proper piece c paper . " Sir , this question has been before the attention of th committee , who have ventured to draw up a list of Pr ( and Cons , which we are ready to recite . " Merlyn cleared his throat , and announced in a lou voice : " PRO . " " In favor of war , " explained the badger . " Number One , " said Merlyn . " War is one of the mail springs of romance . Without war , there would be no R lands , Maccabees , Lawrences , or Hodsons of Hodson Horse . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called virtues , such as couraf and cooperation . In fact , war has momen of glory . It should also be noted that , wit out war , we should lose at least one half our literature . Shakespeare is packed with " Number Two . War is a way of keepir down the population , though it is a hideoi and inefficient one . The same Shakespear who seems on the subject of war to ha ' been in agreement with the Germans ar with their raving apologist Nietzsche , says , in a scei which he is supposed to have written for Beaumont am Fletcher , that it heals with blood the earth when it is sh and cures the world of the pleurisy of people . Perhaps may mention in parentheses , without irreverence , that tl Bard seems to have been curiously insensitive on the su ject of warfare . King Henry V is the most revolting I know , as Henry himself is the most revolting charade " Number Three . War does provide a vent for the per up ferocity of man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be needed . The committ finds from an examination of history that human cruel will vent itself in one way , if it is denied another . Dori the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , when war was limited exercise confined to professional armies recruit from the criminal classes , the general mass of the popul tion resorted to public executions , dental operations wit out anesthetics , brutal sports , and flogging their childrt In the twentieth century , when war was extended to eJ brace the masses , hanging , hacking , cockfighting , a : spanking went out of fashion . " Number Four . The committee is at present occupi about a complicated investigation into the physical or ps iological necessity . We do not feel that a report can be tide at this stage with profit , but we think we have obrved that war does answer a real need in man . perhaps rnnected with the ferocity mentioned in Article Three , it perhaps not . It has come to our notice that man bearies restless or dejected after a generation of Peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks that - ; ace seems to breed a disease , which , coming to a head a sort of ulcer , bursts out into war . ' War , ' he says , ' is e imposthume-of much wealth and peace , which only eaks , shewing no outward cause why the man dies . ' Unr this interpretation , it is the peace which is regarded as slow disease , while the bursting of the imposthumc , the ir , must be assumed to be beneficial rather than the rerse . The committee has suggested two ways in which ealth and Peace might destroy the race , if war were evented : by emasculating it , or by rendering it coma-c through glandular troubles . On the subject of emaslation , it should be noted that wars double the birth-Lc . The reason why women tolerate war is because it omotes virility in men . " Number Five . Finally , there is the suggestion which mld probably be made by every other animal on the 1 .. e of this earth , except man , namely that war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it does of- some faint hope of exterminating the human race . " CON , " announced the magician ; but the king prevent-him . " We know the objections , " he said . " The m that it is useful might be considered ittle more . If there is some necessity for ght , why is the committee ready to stop ? If " Sir , the committee is attempting to trace physiological basis , possibly for a pitury or adrenal origin . Possibly the human , tern requires periodical doses of adrenne in order to remain healthy . The Japanese , as an tance of glandular activity , are said to eat large quanes of fish , which , by charging their bodies with iodine , ) ands their thyroids and makes them touchy . ) Until s matter has been properly investigated the subject reins vague , but the committee desires to point out that physiological need could be supplied by other means . ix , it has already been observed , is an inefficient way of : ping down the population : it may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . " What other ways ? " ' Under the Roman Empire , the experiment of offering ody spectacles in the circus was attempted as a substi .. They provided the Purgation which Aristotle talks mt , and some such alternative might be found efficient . ence , however , would suggest more radical cures . Eir the glandular deficiency might be supplied by pedied injections of the whole population with adrenaline ir with whatever the deficiency may prove to be  --  or some form of surgery might be found effective . Per-* the root of war is removable , like the appendix . " We were told that war is caused by National Prop-r : now we are told that it is due to a gland . " " Sir , the two things may be related , though they may not be consequent upon one another . For instance , if wars were solely due to national property , we should expect them to continue without intermission so long as national property continued : that is , all the time . We find , however , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems as if the human race becomes more and more comatose during these periods of truce , until , when what you may call the saturation point of adrenaline deficiency has been reached , it seizes upon the first handy excuse for a good shot of fear-stimulant . The handy excuse is national property . Even if the wars are dolled up as religious ones . such as crusades against Saladin or Montezuma , the basis remains the same . Nobody would have troubled to extend the benefits of Christianity to Montezuma if his sandals had not been made of gold , and nobody would have thought the gold itself a sufficient temptation if they had not been needing a dose of adrenaline . " " You suggest an alternative like the circus , pending the investigation of your gland . Have you considered it ? " Archimedes giggled unexpectedly . " Merlyn wants to have an international fair , Sir . He wants to have a lot of flip flaps and giant wheels and scenic railways in a reservation , and they are all to be slightly dangerous , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entrance is to be voluntary , for he says that the one unutterably wicked thing about a war is conscription . He says that people will go to the fair of their own free will , through boredom or through adrenaline deficiency or whatever it is , and that they are likely to feel the need for it during their twenty-fifth , thirtieth , and for . ty-fifth years . It is to be made fashionable and glorious to go . Every visitor will get a commemorative medal , while those who go fifty times will get what he calls the DSO or the VC for a hundred visits . " The magician looked ashamed and cracked his fingers . " The suggestion , " he said humbly , " was more to pro ? yoke thought , than to be thought of . " " Certainly it does not seem a practical suggestion for the present year of grace . Are there no panaceas for war which could be used in the meantime ? " " The committee has suggested an antidote which might have ' a temporary effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no use as a cure for the malady , though it might alleviate it . It might save a few million lives in a century . " " What is this antidote ? " " Sir , you will have noticed that the people who are re ? sponsible for the declaration and the higher conduct of wars do not tend to be the people who endure their extremes . At the battle of Bedegraine , Your Majesty dealt with something of the same sort . The kings and the generals and the leaders of battles have a peculiar aptitude for not being killed in them . The committee has suggested that , after every war , all the officials on the losing side who held a higher rank than colonel ought to be executed out of hand , irrespective of their war guilt . No doubt there would be a certain amount of injustice in this measure , but the consciousness that death was the certain result of losing a war would have a deterrent effect on those who help to promote and to regulate such engagements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of lives among the lower classes . Even a Fiihrer like Mordrcd might think twice about heading hostilities , if he knew that his own execution would be the result of being unlucky in them . " " It seems reasonable . " " It is less reasonable than it seems , partly because the responsibility for warfare does not lie wholly with the leaders . After all , a leader has to be chosen or accepted by those whom he leads . The Hydra-headed multitudes are not so innocent as they like to pretend . They have given a mandate to their generals , and they must abide by the moral responsibility . " " Still , it would have the effect of making the leaders reluctant to be pushed into warfare by their followers , and even that would help . " " It would help . The difficulty would lie in persuading the leading classes to agree to such a convention in the first place . Also , I am afraid that you will find there is always a type of maniac , anxious for notoriety at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the pomp of leadership with even greater alacrity because it was enhanced by melodramatic penalties . The kings of Irish mythology were compelled by their station to march in the forefront of the battle , which occasioned a frightful mortality among them , yet there never seems to have been a lack of kings or battles in the history of the Green Isle . " " What about this newfangled Law , " asked the goat suddenly , " which our king has been inventing ? If individuals can be deterred from murder by fear of a death penalty , why can not there be an international law , under which nations can he deterred from war by similar means ? An aggressive nation might be kept at peace by the knowledge that . if it began a war , some international police force would sentence it to dispersal , by mass transportation to other countries . for instance . " " There are two objections to that . First , you would be trying to cure the disease , not to prevent it . Second , we know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact abolish murder . It might , however , prove to be a temporary step in the right direction . " The old man folded his hands in his sleeves , like a Chinaman , and looked round the council table , doggedly , waiting for further questions . His eyes had begun to discharge their watch . " He has been writing a book called the Libellus Merlini , the Prophecies of Merlyn , " continued Archimedes wickedly , when he saw that this subject had been concluded , " which he had intended to read aloud to Your Majesty , as soon as you arrived . " " We will hear a reading . " Merlyn wrung his hands . " Sir , " he said . " It is mere fortune-telling , only gypsy tricks . It had to be written because there was a good deal of fuss about it in the twelfth century , after which we ar to lose sight of it until the twentieth . But , oh Sir , it i merely a parlor game  --  not worth Your Majesty 's atter tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , nonetheless . " So the humiliated scientist , all of whose quips and qui ( dities had been knocked out of him in the last how fetched his burnt manuscript from the fender and hande round a collection of such slips as were still legible , as it had been a parlor game in earnest .

" " The Bear will cure his headache by cutting off h head  --  but it will leave him with a sore behind . " " The Lion will lie down with the Eagle , saying , At la all the animals are united ! But the Devil will see the joke " The Stars which taught the Sun to rise must agn with him at noon  --  or vanish . " " A child standing in Broadway will cry , Look mothe there is a man !

" " The destiny of all species is extincti as such , fortunately for them . " There was a pause after the last motto , while the 1 teners thought them over . " What is the meaning of the one with the Greek word " Sir , a part of its meaning , but only a small part , that the one hope for our human race must lie in edw tion without coercion . As Confucius has it , In order to propagate virtue to the world , one must fi rule one 's country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first rule on family . In order to rule one 's family , one must first regul , one 's body by moral training . In order to regulate one 's body , one must first regal , one 's mind . In order to regulate the mind , one must first be sing in one 's intentions . In order to be sincere in one 's intentions , one must fi increase one 's knowledge . " " I see . " " Have the rest any relevant meaning ? " added the kii " None whatever . " " One further question before we rise . You have st at politics are out of order , but they seem so closely tied the question of warfare that they must be faced to some tent . At an earlier stage you claimed to be a capitalist . -e you sure of these views ? " " If I said so , Your Majesty , I did not mean it . Badger Is talking at me like a communist of the nineteenenties , which made me talk like a capitalist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible person . point of fact the race will find that capitalists and corn-mists modify themselves so much during the ages that ty end by being indistinguishable as democrats : and so ll the fascists modify themselves , for that matter . But Latever may be the contortions adopted by these three mds of collectivism , and however many the centuries ring which they butcher each other out of childish ill riper , the fact remains that all forms of collectivism are staken , according to the human skull . The destiny of al is an individualistic destiny , and it is in that sense it I may have implied a qualified approval of capital if I imply it . The despised Victorian capitalist , who at least allow a good deal of play to the individual , s probably more truly futuristic in his politics than all New Orders shrieked for in the twentieth century . He s of the future , because individualism lies in the future the human brain . He was not so old-fashioned as the nmunists .

" I thought , " said the badger plaintively , at communism was supposed to be a 3 towards anarchy . I thought that when monism had been properly achieved state would wither away . " People have told me so , but I doubt it . cannot see how you may emancipate an individual by t creating an omnipotent state . There are no states in ure , except among monstrosities like the ants . It seems me that people who go creating states , as Mordred is hag to do with his Thrashers , must tend to become inved in them , and so unable to escape . But perhaps what I say is true . I hope it is . In any case let us leave these rious questions of politics to the dingy tyrants who look a-them . Ten thousand years from now it may be time the educated to concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race to grow up . for our part have offered a solution this evening to special problem of force as an arbiter : the obvious : itude that war is due to national property , with the 3r that it is stimulated by certain glands .

He was at his trick of watching his hands , when in abstraction . He folded the paper this way , that way , carefully , and unfolded it . It was one of Merlyn 's notes , a quotation from a historian called Friar Clynn , who had died in 1348 . This friar , employed as the annalist of his abbey to keep the historical records , had seen the Black Death coming to fetch him  --  possibly to fetch the whole world , for it had killed a third of the population of Europe already .

" The king folded it neatly , measured it on the table . They watched him , knowing he was about to rise and ready to follow his example . " Very good , " he said . " We understand the puzzle .

As a possession it had long ceased to he of val-ue to him , and he had come to know for sure that peace was more important than a kingdom .

The truce was made , the armies drawn up in their battles , face to face . Each had a standard made from a ship 's mast set on wheels , at the top of which a small box held the consecrated Host , while , from the masts , there Hew the banners of the Dragon and the Thistle .

Arthur went forward to the space between the armies with his staff , and Mordred , with his own staff in their black accoutrements , came out to meet him . They encountered , and the old king saw his son 's face once again . It was taut and haggard : He too , poor man , had strayed beyond Sorrow and Solitude to the country of Kennaqu ? hair ; but he had gone without a guide and lost his way .

In those days the rules of convents were not so stri. as they are now . Often they were more like hostelries fc their well-born patrons . Guenever had taken the veil Amesbury .

He even learned to distinbird-songs in the woods , and to have time for all sings which had been denied to him by Uncle Dap . leame an excellent gardener , and a reputed saint . ose , " says a medieval poem about another old cru , a great lord like Lancelot in his day , and one who - etired from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doni spiritualis , . : sse Christi cupiens miles specialis , n hac clomp formulas factus est claustralis. after the bustle of temporal warfare , ? nlightened with the grace of a spiritual gift , ovetous to be the special soldier of Christ , n this house was made a cloistered monk . re than usually placid , gentle and benign , Is white as a swan on account of his old age , Bland and affable and lovable , le possessed in. himself the grace of the Holy Spirit . he often frequented Holy Church , oyfully listened to the mysteries of the Mass , ' roclaimed such praises as he was able , ! ad mentally ruminated the heavenly glory . gentle and jocose conversation , light , - commendable and religious , 7as thus pleasing to the whole fraternity , ' ecause it was neither stuffy nor squeamish. e , as often as he rambled across the cloister , re bowed from side to side to the monks , nd he saluted with a bob of his head , thus , he ones whom he loved most intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ad monachos caput inclinavit , t sic nutu capitis cos salutavit , luos affectu intimo plurimum amavit . When his own death-hour came , it was accompanied by visions in the monastery . The old abbot dreamed of bells sounding most beautifully , and of angels , with happy laughter , hauling Lancelot to Heaven . They found him dead in his cell , in the act of accompliSling the third and last of his miracles . For he had died in what was called the Odor of Sanctity . When saints die , their bodies fill the room with lovely scent : perhaps of new hay , or of blossom in the spring , or of the clean seashore . . Ector pronounced his brother 's keen , one of the most touching pieces of prose in the language . He said : " Ah , Lancelot , thou wert head of all Christian knights .

" The Round Table had been smashed at Salisbury , its few survivors thinning out as the years went by . At last there were only four of them left : Bars the misogynist , Bleoberis , Ector , and Demaris . These old men made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land , for the repose of the souls of all their comrades . and there they died upon a Good Friday for God 's sake . the last of the Round Table . Now there are none of them left : only knights of the Bath and of other orders degraded by comparison . About King Arthur of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there remains a mystery to this day . Some think that he and Vlordred perished on each other 's swords . Robert of ThorMon mentions that be was attended by a surgeon of Salerno who found by examination of his wounds that he could never be whole again , so " he said In menus* boldly on the place where he lay ... and spake no more . " Those who adhere to this account claim that he was buried at Glastonbury , under a stone which said : HIC JACET ARTURUS REX QUONDAM REX QUE CUTURUS and that his body was exhumed by Henry Il as a counterblast to Welsh nationalism  --  for the Cymry were claiming even then that the great king had never perished . They believed that he would come again to lead them , and they also mendaciously asserted , as usual , his British nationality . Adam of Domerham tells us , on the other hand , that the exhumation took place in April 1278 , under Edward 1 , and that he himself was a witness of the proceedings ; while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward 11I  --  who , by the way , revived the Round Table in 1344 as a serious order of knighthood like the Garter . Whatever the real date may have been , tradition has it that the bones when exhumed were of gigantic stature , and Guenever 's had golden hair . ' 1 ' " Into Thy hands . " The entire phrase , from the death of Jesus ( Luke 23:46 ) , is " into Thy hands , I commend my spirit . " 4-* " Here lies Arthur , the Once and Future King . " Then there is another tale , widely supported , that our hero was carried away td the Vale of Affalach by a collection of queens in a magic boat . These are believed to have ferried him across the Severn to their own country , there to heal him of his wounds . The Italians have got hold of an idea about a certain Arturo Magno who was translated to Mount Etna , where he can still be seen occasionally , they say . Don Quixote the Spaniard , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , maintains that he became a raven ? an assertion which may not seem so wholly ridiculous to those who have read our little story . Then there are the Irish , who have muddled him up with one of the FitzGeralds and declare that he rides round a rath , with sword upraised , to the " Londonderry Air . " The Scots , who have a legend about Arthur Knyght ITlha raid on nycht Killen spur And candel lycht , still swear to him in Edinburgh , where they believe that he presides from Arthur 's Seat . The Bretons claim to have heard his horn and to have seen his armor , and they also believe he will return . A book called The High History of the Holy Grail , which was translated by an irascible scholar called Dr. Sebastian Evans , says , on the contrary . that he was safely buried in a house of religion " that standeth at the head of the Moors Adventurous . " A Miss Jessie L. Weston mentions a manuscript which she pleases to call 1533 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that the queen who came to carry him away was none other than the aged enchantress Morgan , his half sister , and that she took him to a magic island . Dr. Sommer regards the entire account as absurd . A lot of people called Wolfram von Eschenbach , Ulrich von Zatzikhoven . Dr. Wechssler . Professor Zimmer , Mr. Nutt , and so forth , either scout the question wholly , or remain in learned confusion . Chaucer , Spenser , Shakespeare , Milton , Wordsworth , Tennyson , and a number of other reliable witnesses agree that he is still on earth : Milton inclining to the view that he is underneath it ( Arturumque etiam sub terris Mitt rnoventem* ) , while Tennyson is of the opinion that he will come again to visit us like a modern Gentleman of stateliest port , " possibly like the Prince Consort . Shakespeare 's contribution is to place the beloved Falstaff , at his death , not in Abraham 's but in Arthur 's bosom . ? The legends of the common people are beautiful , strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says * " And Arthur too , stirring up wars beneath the earth . " that , in the woods of Britain , " the foresters tell that alternate days , about noon , or at midnight when 1 moon is full and shiny , they often see an array of hue men who , in answer to enquirers , say they are of I household and fellowship of Arthur . " These , howev were probably real bands of Saxon poachers . like I followers of Robin Hood , who had named their gang honor of the ancient king . The men of Devon are customed to point out " the chair and oven " of Art1 among the rocks of their coast . In Somersetshire are some villages caller East and West Camel(ot) , tioned by Leland . which are beset with legends of a ki still sitting in a golden crown . It is to be noted that river Ivel , whence , according to Drayton , our " Luigi deeds and brave achievements sprang , " is in the sa county . So is South Cadbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do say that in night of the full moon King Arthur and his men r round the hill , and their horses are shod with silver , am silver shoe has been found in the track where they do ri and when they have ridden round the hill they do s to water their horses at the wishing well . " Finally th is the little village of Bodmin in Cornwall , whose inh itants are certain that the king inhabits a local tumul In 1113 they even assaulted , within the sanctuary , a r ty of monks from Brittany  --  an unheard-of thing to dl because they had thrown doubts upon the legend . It to be admitted that some of these dates scarcely fit in the thorny subject of Arthurian chronology , and Malc that great man who is the noblest source of all this I tory , maintains a discreet reserve . As for myself , I can not forget the hedgehog 's last fi well , coupled with Quixote 's hint about the animals Milton 's subterranean dream . It is little more than a tlry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumulus , and , if it is like an enormous molehill v a dark opening in its side , particularly if there are sc badger tracks in the vicinity , we can draw our own elusions . For I am inclined to believe that my Belo Arthur of the future is sitting at this very moment am ? his learned friends , in the Combination Room of the lege of Life , and that they are thinking away in there all they are worth , about the best means to help our rious species ; and I for one hope that some day , w not only England but the World has need of them , when it is ready to listen to reason , if it ever is , they issue from their rath in joy and power ; and then , perh they will give us happiness in the world once more chivalry , and the old medieval blessing of certain sin people  --  who tried , at any rate , in their own small way still the ancient brutal dream of Attila the Hun .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
