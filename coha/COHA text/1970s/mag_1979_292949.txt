Washington trades two Soviet spies for five dissidents <P> From distant points in the vast Gulag archipelago , five bone-weary men were rounded up and taken to Moscow . At 4 a.m. on Friday of last week , they were abruptly awakened , handed suits in exchange for prison garb , curtly informed that they were being stripped of their Soviet citizenship , and rushed to Sheremetyevo Airport . There they boarded Aeroflot Flight 315 for New York City . At Kennedy Airport in the foggy afternoon , the ex-prisoners of conscience-Dissidents Alexander Ginzburg , Georgi Vins , Mark Dymshits , Eduard Kuznetsov and Valentyn Moroz-were released into American hands , while two convicted Soviet spies were hustled aboard the plane for the return flight to Moscow . It was one of the largest , most surprising swaps in the history of U.S.-Soviet relations , and the first in which Soviet spies had been exchanged for Soviet citizens . <P> After arriving at their posh hotel near the United Nations , the newly liberated men wandered in and out of one another 's rooms , exclaiming : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . At a press conference Kuznetsov declared : " This is just as incredible as if we found ourselves on the moon . It is difficult to get this through our heads . We still have not grown accustomed to free faces expressing good will . " Two of the dissidents , Kuznetsov and Dymshits , then left for Israel ; the other three are expected to remain in the U.S. Moroz went to a parade in his honor in Philadelphia . Ukrainian groups , noted an Administration official , " looked at Moroz like some kind of icon , since they have been working for him so long . " <P> The trade had been made possible by a pair of bungling KGB agents , Valdik Enger and Rudolf Chernyayev , who were arrested last May for trying to buy secret information from a U.S. naval officer ; in October they were sentenced to 50 years in prison for espionage . Even before the trial ended , negotiations for a swap began . President Carter directed National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski to conduct the talks with Soviet Ambassador Anatoli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of both negotiators , occasionally in Brzezinski 's house in McLean , Va. , where his daughter and Dobrynin 's granddaughter sometimes rode horses together . <P> " We had our ups and downs , " says a U.S. official , " but it finally congealed . " Moscow promised that the dissidents would soon be joined in the West by members of their immediate families . The Americans , however , failed to win the release of Anatoli Shcharansky , the leading Jewish dissident who was jailed for treason last summer . He was apparently too much of a symbol of resistance to the Soviet regime to be allowed to go free . <P> The five prisoners who were released are major figures in their own right and an undeniable windfall for the West : <P> Ginzburg , 42 , was constantly harassed and finally imprisoned for writings critical of Communist life . He further antagonized authorities by becoming a self-appointed monitor of Moscow 's compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki accord . He was brought to trial once again last summer for his role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Solzhenitsyn . Defiant as ever , he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor .
