A BOY AND HIS DOG <P> Directed and Written by L.Q.JONES <P> World War III has happened again , and as usual , the earth has been nuked to dusty desert ruled by violent brigand bands . <P> The boy and the dog of the ironic title - though R-rated , the film is definitely not a co-feature for Benjie - owe allegiance to no one . Vic , the boy ( Don Johnson ) , is strong and a good shot . It is true that he is a little short on smarts , but Blood , his shaggy pal , more than compensates for that . Though he is able to talk only to his master , his brain is as shrewd as his nose . <P> In its early going , this inexpensive little picture risks being absurd , yet com pels respect for some witty writing and well-paced direction . The film gets better as it goes along , for itliterally has a second level . <P> Underneath the earth 's blasted crust , another group is trying to survive . <P> Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that American writers since Sinclair Lewis have been excoriating . Prudish and bigoted , they have everything their smug little hearts could desire - except the power to reproduce themselves ( probably because they lack fresh air and real sunshine ) . They must send sirens up to lure studs down , and that is where the boy - despite his dog 's warning - goes wrong , precipitating one of the year 's better chase adventures .
