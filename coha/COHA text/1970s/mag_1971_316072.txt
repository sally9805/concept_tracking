Japan 's Allure <P> Sir : Why does the American consumer buy Japanese products May 10 ? Why does the American consumer buy products other than American ? Simple . Quality , price , customer relations . Too often the American dealer is great until he has your money and then to hell with you . I have bought foreign products not out of disloyalty to my country or big business , but because I am sick and tired of getting junk for my money and nothing for my patronage . <P> ORVEL K. JANS Major , U.S.A.F. APO New York <P> Sir : Break out the crying towels and sour-grape wine for U.S. business . For years , while we were squeezing the life out of foreign nations , no one complained . Now the U.S. is learning of its own tactics from Japan-and the tears start . <P> RICHARD TOURANGEAU Boston <P> Sir : What the Japanese military forces could not accomplish in 1941-45 with bullets and bombs-a successful invasion of the United States-the Japanese business community is actually doing today with consumer goods . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a precedent for the world at large and particularly our Communist antagonists-that advancement through force is now anachronistic . <P> SAMUEL S. SHERWIN Los Angeles <P> Sir : We won the war , but the Japanese must now be enjoying a good laugh at our expense . <P> In exchange for our precious natural resources , which we obtain by stripping our national forests and ravishing our Appalachian Mountains for coal , we are sent a bunch of consumer junk , and we still end up with a billion-dollar-per-year deficit in the balance of payments . <P> R.J. BRUEHLMAN Wilmington , Del . <P> Sir : The solution to " How to Cope with Japan 's Business Invasion " is simple . It 's one I 've been practicing on my own ever since I returned from the Pacific theater toward the end of World War II . Whenever I must buy any article , I first examine it to see where it was made . If the inscription " Made in Japan " appears on it , I toss it back onto the store counter and either make do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to make Japan 's economy any stronger . Wake up , America . Buy American . <P> ROBERT J. MILLER Philadelphia <P> Protest Debate <P> Sir : Nobody has told the unvarnished truth about these protest marches in Washington May 10 , and that is that we are conducting a kind of civil war against our own young people . <P> What do we have-Nixon prancing round the country while kids in the capital city are being teargassed . What do we have-19th century Agnew pontificating somewhere while long-haired youths are being herded into compounds . <P> I 'm in my 60s and I 'm ashamed of my peers . These young ones are sometimes a little messy , but they are trying to change things . They are trying to make us realize that war is an outmoded horror . <P> HALE WILLIS Fullerton , Calif . <P> Sir : If Rennie Davis &; Co. do n't know what is in the heads of the people who go to work every day , maybe someone should try whispering the message quietly in their ears : " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanoi . " Maybe our semisacred fourth estate should lend an ear to that message a little more often too . <P> GORDON ELLIOTT Agana , Guam <P> Why Did the Chicken ? <P>
