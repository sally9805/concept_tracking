While becoming one of Norway 's richest men , self-made Shipping Magnate Hilmar Reksten , 75 , made more than his share of business enemies . Even two of his children sued him in disputes over money . He was luckier in his two marriages to rich women , who helped to tide him over in tough times . Reksten amassed a fleet of 15 ships , 2.3 million deadweight tons , and the recent boom in tanker rates has greatly enhanced his multimillion-dollar fortune . At times , he can even let his ships lie idle while waiting for rates to go still higher . <P> Lately the Norseman has hit American shores . He began by maneuvering to buy Zapata Naess , the shipping branch of Houston 's big , diversified Zapata Corp. - and management resisted . Then Reksten offered to buy control of the entire corporation from shareholders ; to prevent that , Zapata management caved in and agreed to sell the shipping branch .

' s shipping operations netted half of its $29.5 million gross profit last year .

With demand rising for oil-and the tankers that carry it-the old Norseman stands to make a new fortune .
