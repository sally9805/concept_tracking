DISPATCHES by Michael Herr Knopf ; 260 pages ; $8.95 <P> A5 the raw material of public memory , the war in Viet Nam has been a bust . <P> This is not simply because the U.S. role in that conflict ended with a whimper ; unreconstructed Southerners and the Irish have shown how immortal ballads rise from lost causes . But Viet Nam dragged on too bitterly and too long to be tucked comfortably into a corner of the mind . Between the memorable images of self-immolating monks and returning American P.O.W.s , there stretched a decade of contradictory violence and rhetoric that splintered the country . Trying to remember , much less grasp , that history now seems like reopening a scar . <P> Journalist Michael Herr , 37 , writes about this war while admitting that " people do n't even want to hear about it . " Happily , he does not take the next step and insist that people damn well ought to hear about it for their own good . Nor does he justify his work by parading Santayana 's maxim about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Those who remember the past are condemned to repeat it too . " He preaches no sermons , draws no morals , enters no ideological disputes . He simply suggests that some stories must be told-not because they will delight and instruct but because they happened . <P> Herr arrived in Viet Nam on a vague assignment from Esquire in the latter part of 1967 . His working conditions were ideal-no real deadlines , the freedom to travel wherever military transport would take him-and his timing was fortuitous . His year in the country coincided with some of the war 's fiercest struggles-Tet and the battle for Hue , the siege at Khe Sanh and the Viet Cong 's May 1968 Saigon offensive . Although he regularly cursed his own bravado , Herr made a point of being wherever the action was hottest , convinced that the war 's " secret history " must exist there : " Somewhere on the periphery of that total Viet Nam issue whose daily reports made the morning papers too heavy to bear , lost in the surreal contexts of television , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been , men hunting men . a hideous war and all kinds of victims . " <P> Dispatches reprints the reports that Herr sent home from the war , eyewitness accounts of combat that are even more scarifying in retrospect than they seemed at the time . But Herr blends these pieces with meditations on Viet Nam that began in earnest when his look at the shooting was over . For Herr came to realize that Viet Nam was the most intense experience life was ever likely to offer him . Hating the idea of becoming a combat freak , a reporter who needed a war somewhere in order to function , he also recognized the pain that he and fellow correspondents felt when their tours were up : " A few extreme cases felt that the experience there had been a glorious one , while most of us felt that it had been merely wonderful . I think that Viet Nam was what we had instead of happy childhoods . "                   @ @
