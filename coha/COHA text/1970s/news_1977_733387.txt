txt From Tribune Wire Services ST . SIMONS ISLAND , Ga . ? Presidents often have complained about living in a " fishbowl " at the White House , but Jimmy Carter long ago discovered this island retreat where the only unwelcome guest is a wandering alligator , a wild boar , or perhaps the resident king snake . Deep in the heart of the 1,800-acre Musgrove Plantation , Carter 's getaway residence here is miles from the single main road that leads to a 17th-Century English fort and a historic Episcopal church . ? The day after Carter 's election , he arrived here with his family and attendants under the moss  --  dripping oak trees and signed the guest register : " This was a great place to end a campaign and to begin an administration . " Although he has since gone to Camp David , Md. , for weekends , here on the " Golden Isles " off Georgia 's Atlantic coast he enjoys long-term privacy . SEMITROPICAL and very Southern . St. Simons is little known outside Georgia . Its sugar-sand beaches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colder off-season . But to the island 's 10,000 residents , many of whom are direct descendents of plantation owners and slaves , the signal that the President is coming is the early arrival of hundreds of just-washed renta-cars for the White House staff , the press , and the Secret Service . Speeding down this narrow roads and filling up hotel rooms here and on nearby islands , the visitors are viewed with excitement and some dismay . " After Carter first came here , " coin ? plained a middle-aged woman , " we got a lot more kids in vans . All they want is a beer can in one hand and a girl in the 1 : other . " But St. Simons has survived other at // ? President vacations on a paradise isle // tacks going back to 1742 when British and Spanish troops fought the Battle of Bloody Marsh . The battleground , just down the road from Carter 's hideaway , is only one of the historic settings that provide grace and charm to the marsh-encircled island . CARTER first visited here as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island and opened it for official meetings , Carter stayed at friends ' homes on St. Simons . In 1974 Carter met Smith Bagley , the 41-year-old grandson of R. J. Reynolds and heir to the tobacco fortune . The Bagleys , who live in Washington , often invite Carter and other guests to use the private cottages and meandering streams of the plantations . " There 's normally pretty good trout fishing there , " said Dr. Carlton Hicks , an island resident and Carter fishing buddy . " We play a lot of tennis when he 's here , and he enjoys fishing for sea trout , which run about a pound and a half or 2 pounds . " Although there is a 10-acre lake stocked with bream and bass on the plantation , Dr. Hicks said Carter angles for saltwater fish and then " cooks them up " back at the cottages . The " cottages " really are cottages , though very tasteful and expensive ones . After Bagley 's mother consolidated several older plantations and lands back in the 1930s , she decided against building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects design several cottages in the Low Country style . The cottages , beside 20 acres of ViiColumn 1 lege Creek , are one and two stories , made of cypress boards and tabby , a mixture of oyster shells , lime , and sand . The President and his wife , Rosalynn , during their vacations here have stayed in Marsh House , a cottage with one bedroom with a king-size bed , hand-painted headboard , and a view of the grassy marsh , which is protected from development by state law . The hook-lined sitting room with its fireplace of Savannah gray brick quickly became Carter 's vacation office when his newly appointed Cabinet officers met with him here . TWO OF the largest cottages , named the Boat House anti Grove House , were used for entertaining and dinners for up to 110 guests . The furnishings have been termed " elegantly simple " by visitors . Wall decorations include Toulouse-Lautrec lithographs and original drawings by Diego Rivera and Ruffin Tamayo . The highceiling beams were cut and rough-hewn by craftsmen with axes . The crypress siding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RECREATION , there . are a swimming pool and a ping-pong table . But probably most popular is strolling through formal gardens of low hedges , azaleas , yellow jessamine , camellias , and other shrubs graced by early Roman statuary . While the Carters stay inside the wellguarded and floodlit grounds , top aides stay at the Cloisters , an expensive resort on nearby Sea Island , where former Budget Director Bert Lance keeps a vacation home . Other aides are scattered in hotels on St. Simons or on Jekyll Island . Sea Island , Simons , and Jekyll are the only three islands of the coastal chain that are connected to the mainland by causeways . But before the causeways were built , Jekyll was one of the most exclusive resorts in tile country with its millionaire club comprising the likes of J. P. Morgan , Cyrus McCormick , and families named Rockefeller , Pulitzer , Vanderbilt , and Harriman . The club 's promotional lore boasts that at one time one-sixth of the world 's wealth was represented by members . In 1942 , when German submarines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island evacuated . Several years later , Georgia bought the island from the club families with the intention of turning it into a low-cast vacation spot for Georgia residents , But prices are not cheap at any of the developed islands , especially during summer when rooms at the better hotels run up to $50 a night . As a guest , Carter , of course , need n't worry about that . During his infrequent trips here , his time is spent closeted with aides or enjoying the wilderness of the plantation.
