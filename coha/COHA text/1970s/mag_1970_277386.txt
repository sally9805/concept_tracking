EVEN if a new round of Middle East talks were to begin soon , even if the negotiations were to succeed beyond the most optimistic expectations , the region would still be a long way from tranquillity . For none of the peace formulas currently being debated offers a workable solution to the issue that has been at the heart of the Middle East 's troubles for 23 years : the fate of more than 3,000,000 Palestinian Arabs . <P> The more militant Palestinians maintain that they will settle for nothing less than the creation of a homeland that would in effect obliterate what is now Israel . Guerrilla Leader Yasser Arafat , in an interview with TIME Correspondent Dan Coggin in Amman , pledged to keep on fighting until he achieves that goal . Arafat is now the " supreme commander " of a guerrilla organization that may still number as many as 50,000 fighters despite losses last fall in battles with Jordanian troops . " We have more recruits than we can handle , " Arafat told Coggin . Eleven separate guerrilla organizations that existed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will maintain separate structures but act jointly . " We have achieved a unity of guns , " said Arafat , adding confidently : " The hijackings were an unnecessary cry in the night . We are a fact . We 're not in need of such methods to prove our existence . " <P> Four Solutions . In their demands for a Palestinian state , Arafat and the other guerrilla leaders are reaching for more than they are likely to get . But their basic demand-the creation of some sort of Palestinian homeland for long-dispossessed Arab refugees-seems inescapable . Concedes Secretary-General Arie Eliav of Israel 's governing Labor Party : " The first thing we have to do is to recognize that the Palestinian Arabs exist as an infant nation . " <P> The fundamental tragedy of the land is that two cultures Arab and Jewish-have proper claims to this small but special strip . The conflict between them , as Washington Journalist I.F . Stone notes , is " a struggle of right against right . " Constant shifts in territory ( see box ) inevitably caused wrenches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Palestine v. 650,000 Jews . Today there are only 400,000 Arabs in Israel v. 2,350,000 Jews . Another 700,000 Arabs live on the occupied West Bank and 360,000 in the Gaza Strip , which Israel captured from Egypt during the Six-Day War of 1967 . Nearly 1,500,000 Palestinians live outside their ancient homeland , most in the squalid refugee camps in neighboring Jordan , Syria and Lebanon , where the guerrilla movement was born . <P> Four solutions to the Palestinian problem have been proposed : <P> REPATRIATION OR COMPENSATION . No matter how borders are redrawn in future peace talks , Israel is certain to retain some territory that the Palestinians regard as properly theirs . Arabs who once lived in these areas would be given the option of returning to Israeli rule or accepting compensation and living elsewhere . Arab spokesmen insist that no more than 10% would return . Israel worries that the total could be higher and the security risk grave .
