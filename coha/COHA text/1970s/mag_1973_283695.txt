It was not that Sam Ervin was tired , though he has been working harder than ever . Nor did he have any doubts of being able to whip the younger men who have an eye on the Senate seat that he has occupied for nearly 20 years . It was simply that at 77 he felt that he was too old to carry on . Last week he phrased his announcement that he will not stand for re-election next November in those by now familiar rolling cadences-a little of Virgil , a little of Shakespeare , a little of Sam . " Since time takes a constantly accelerating toll of those of us who live many years , " he intoned , " it is simply not reasonable for me to assume that my eye will remain undimmed and my natural force stay unabated for so long a tune . " <P> Ervin had long promised his wife that he would quit , and his decision was a Christmas present for " Miss Margaret . " As Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield once remarked : " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's married to both . " Ervin 's love affair with the Constitution has been lifelong , ardent , unflagging-and finally requited . In an hour of constitutional peril , the Senate turned to Ervin to chair the Watergate investigating committee . <P> The florid , folksy , courtly Southern gentleman-thought to be a vanishing breed-was suddenly resuscitated and became relevant . As one witness after another came before the committee to tell of his shabby doings , Ervin 's devotion to law and liberty shone by contrast . His eyebrows dancing up and down like puppets on a string , he made his points sharply and supported them with apt quotations from Shakespeare and the Bible . He sympathized while he remonstrated with the errant public servants , and redemption was always possible . Ervin intended the investigation to educate the American people , and he succeeded . In turn , he became a culture hero , filling lecture halls with adoring audiences , inspiring youngsters to don T shirts bearing his benign image . <P> Ervin 's Senate career defies conventional analysis . He was a leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible-particularly filibusters . He argued vehemently against the expansion of rights for criminal suspects by the Warren Court . He was a moderate hawk who thought the generals should have their way in Viet Nam . Yet he also became the most formidable opponent of incursions on civil liberties by the Government . Says he : " The history of liberty is the history of limitations of Government power . " <P> Fried Fish . Ervin was a forceful foe of Senator Joe McCarthy when he was indulging in his red-baiting excesses . Ervin was a principal backer of the Bail Reform Act of 1966 that allowed poor people to remain out of jail before their trials if they were reasonable risks . Over the years , he has held many little-publicized hearings looking into Government snooping and surveillance . Finally , as Watergate unfolded , it was as if his entire career were preparatory to this ultimate confrontation with a power-hungry Chief Executive . Fighting the White House on all fronts-from Executive privilege to freedom of the press-Ervin summed up his opposition to the President : " He is treading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
