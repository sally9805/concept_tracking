THE FEARFUL VOID <P> by GEOFFREY MOORHOUSE 288 pages . Lippincott. $10 . <P> Perhaps because its sun-blasted emptiness is so different from their cozily crowded , fog-shrouded island , the trackless desert has always attracted Englishmen . A straight line leads from Sir Richard Burton crossing the Arabian desert in 1853 and Lawrence of Arabia down to Geoffrey Moorhouse . Burton had a simple thirst for the exotic . Lawrence was a complex mystic . Moorhouse , who left Nouakchott , Mauritania , in October of 1972 heading east into the Sahara , is a fortyish ex-journalist . In challenging the desert , he was intent on confronting his own fears and what he took to be personal cowardice . <P> He was , he says , afraid of " annihilation , of being surrounded by what is hostile , of loss and of being lost . " The test that he devised for himself was formidable . Equipped with little more than a knife , a badly calibrated sextant and a crash course in Arabic , he planned to cross from the Atlantic to the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed by a traveler alone . <P> In a matter-of-fact style , Moorhouse tells what it is like to cope with temperatures that soar past 130 by day and drop below freezing at night . He describes the stunning beauty of desert sunsets and the soporific , swaying movement of the camel . He can make a reader comfortably fixed with a Scotch in his hand share the blessed glee of finding brackish water dotted with camel dung that is worth more than gold or oil in a sea of sand . <P> The Fearful Void is a valuable addition to the literature of the desert , and a useful reference for anyone who may be considering a similar exercise in masochism . But it also chronicles a voyage of the spirit . With painful , plodding honesty , Moorhouse examines his insular intolerance of strange customs and his lack of confidence in his ability to evaluate his guides and companions along the way . He confronts the colossal reluctance he felt at having to haul himself into the saddle each morning for another day of pain . Thirst reduced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lone sheepherder or a cold-eyed Tuareg tribesman - knotted his insides with anxiety . <P> Exhausted by illness , Moorhouse abandoned the journey in Tamanrasset , Algeria , some 2,000 miles from his starting point . Was the trip necessary ? Was it a success ? For Moorhouse it was both . He did not conquer his fear - but he appears to have faced himself , which is sometimes the same thing . <P> Peter Stoler
