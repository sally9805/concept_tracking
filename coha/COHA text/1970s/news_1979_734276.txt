txt Diplomacy around the world has become so intricate that when Communist North Korea says it will brook no " alien interference " in its dealings with South Korea , no one can be sure whether this is a rebuff to the United States , China , the Soviet Union or all three . Or it could be no rebuff at all ; President Carter 's bid to arrange coexistence talks between the Koreas may not be clearly answered for months . Relations between the Koreas are of passing interest because the President visited South Korea last weekend , after the Tokyo summit , and suggested a meeting with both North and South Korea to help calm their uneasy frontier . Under cover of this overture , he put off the scheduled withdrawal of 30,000 American ground troops by 1981 . The withdrawal was to have been a symbolic move away from the cold war era . But the risks of more hot war in Korea and the fears of instability there were great enough to allow American generals and Congressmen and the leaders of China and Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all seem ready to find some formula for coexistence between the Communist and non-Communist halves of Korea . This is now called the German solution , but the German preconditions have not been attained . The South Korean economy , to be sure , is booming , like West Germany 's , while North Korea 's is hobbled by a Communist system and by enormous military expenditures . But in too many ways the North Koreans seem stuck in the East German mode of the 1950 's . Unreconciled to a division that leaves them inferior , they keep probing for weakness in the South to upset progress there . And Kim Il Sung , the man who made a bad war in 1950 , continues to rule North Korea by Stalinist methods . He is probably unfit psychologically to make a decent peace . Moreover , the great tension between China and the Soviet Union causes them to compete for influence in North Korea and hinders their collaboration in any diplomatic enterprise . Apparently Peking supports Mr. Carter 's cancellation of the troop withdrawal until there is more accommodation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Il Sung to talk , but the Russians may have counseled a different course . There 's no way to know which aliens are being told to mind their own business . ? Meanwhile , Mr. Carter was right to press the South Koreans to keep building up their own forces and to dismantle the ugliest features of their police state . Time will tell whether he bought more influence with the decision to keep the ground troops in Korea than he did with the earlier decision to pull them back . Their redeployment promised no budgetary gain , so the only possible benefits in any of this are political . America 's commitment to South Korea remains undiluted . It is served by solemn treaty and by a permanent American Air Force contingent . It asserts the United States ' strong interest in defending Japan and in keeping a balance of power throughout northern Asia . Not until the two Koreas come to terms with their fate inside that balance ? like the Germans  --  will they respond to big-power deals .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
