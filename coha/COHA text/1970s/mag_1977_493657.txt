It 's the night before Christmas and all through the international money markets the only sound you hear is the dollar sinking . Last Christmas the German mark cost 42 cents ; now it costs 44 cents , and soon it will cost more . The dollar bought 294 yen a year ago , and now it buys only 2313 . The French franc and even the frail British pound have gone up in value against the dollar this year , and are still climbing . Something odd is happening . Penny by penny , the dollar is withering away . There are two ways of interpreting the dollar 's decline , one mildly gloomy and the other very gloomy . The mild version holds that the shiffin currency values is a temporary aberration , a small hole in the economic fabric that will soon be filled in and set right by the busy patchers of the marketplace . People with this outlook think that the bankers and trade experts will cope with the problem if they are left alone to do their work . The darker view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something much more dangerous that 's wrong with the system , something that ca n't be fixed up by the experts . We think the latter , gloomier view is correct . Small patches will not do the job any longer . The dollar 's slide began early last spring , but did n't really build momentum until the summer . The dollar began to slip when it became clear that the US was running up a large trade deficit with the rest of the world . Americans were buying German and Japanese cars and televisions at a furious pace and importing OPEC oil with blithe abandon . This meant that dollars flooded the international markets , paying for America 's purchases , in torrents so vast that the value began to fall . Nobody was terribly eager to have more dollars . The dollar 's weakness was confirmed at midyear when Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal announced that he did not intend to stop its decline . If he had wanted to , Blumenthal might have driven up demand for the dollar artificially by buying back some of the dollars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blumenthal said instead that he was rather pleased by what was happening . The values of the German markand Japanese yen were low , he said . The Germans and Japanese were keeping their currencies low in order to keep the price of their TVs and cars low , making it easy to sell these goods to Americans . According to the cynical view , the Japanese and the Germans were cheating . We could n't force them to raise the value of their money . We tried to persuade them to export less and to sell more of their goods in their home markets . But , having failed , we did the next best thing . We sped the dollar along on its decline , a roundabout way of making the yen and German mark more valuable . Volkswagens and Sonys will cost more . The dollar 's bad reputation is thus the result of political events and " real " events . The political aspect was Blumenthal 's decision , made last summer , to " talk the dollar down . " This had an impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profit on the rise and fall in the value of currencies . The people who make a living this way read political news with just as much attention as they devote to the news of a factory opening or oil discovery . Knowing that Blumenthal would do nothing to help the dollar , they thought it best to bet against it . This group includes not just the gnomes of Zurich , but managers of OPEC money in New York and red-blooded American executives who manage the currency accounts of large American companies . Probably all of America 's big banks are betting against the dollar right now . It would be wrong to overemphasize the significance of the money gamblers . They are important , but they do n't have the power to make events . By their behavior they signal a consensus judgment about national economies . Their judgment on the American economy is negative . They are like passengers on a big ship who , at the moment the ship begins to list to starboard , all rush in the opposite direction to avoid getting wet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight against the dead drift of momentum . But there is one thing they will not do . They will not go below deck to repair leaks . If the ship has a big unplugged leak in its side , the bettors will rush around in vain , for they will not be able to put things right . America 's deficit with the rest of the world is the leak in the ship . It is expected to amount to about $18 billion this year . The deficit in our current account is made all the more remarkable by the suddenness of its appearance . Only a year ago , the US was breaking even . A reversal of this size has not happened before . This convulsion in the trade markets had an impact not only among the money traders , but way down among the steel workers and television , shoe and car makers as well . Everyone has been affected by the flood of imports . Blumenthal might not put it this way , but the reason the US has such an enormous deficit is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Carter administration came into office , it announced a new plan to fire up the world 's economy , a plan agreed to by all the big industrial nations , including Germany and Japan . The US , being the strongest , would take the first step by stimulating its economy . Soon the others would follow . What happened this year was that Carter and Blumenthal took the first step , but no one followed . The result was that while the US went along its merry way , spending and consuming pretty much as always , Germany and Japan behaved as though they were engaged in a trade war . They used their central money policies to discourage consumer buying at home and to subsidize the prices of goods they exported overseas . In a phrase used by economists , they exported their unemployment to us . ( The Germans and Japanese say that the reason their goods have sold so well in the US is that they are better made than ours . ) The US tolerated this trade imbalance all year , but Blumenthal has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their monetary policies all the while . He urged them to stimulate domestic consumption and to export less . He talked and waited , but nothing happened . Then , when the dollar began its decline , he sped it along . He hoped this would put more pressure on the Germans and Japanese , by making their goods more expensive every day . Finally things began to happen . Germany adopted a domestic stimulus plan about six weeks ago . It consists chiefly of business and individual tax cuts , and it amounted to about $4. o billion . At this writing , Japan has not yet decided what it will do , but a new cabinet has been installed and a domestic stimulus plan is expected soon . Last week the Japanese foreign economics minister , Nobuhiko Ushiba , was summoned to Washington , DC for a harangue on this subiect . The Japanese submit to this treatment periodically , and then promise to reform . Blumenthal 's stern words earlier in the year produced smiles and promises , but nothing else . Now Carter 's trade negotiator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may be more adept at this than Blumenthal . He is a tough , pragmatic man of affairs , so useful when bully-work is to be done . ( For anassessment of Strauss 's role in the Carter administra ? tion , see this week 's " White House Watch " on page 13 . ) When the Japanese arrived in town , they pledged to cut tariffs on 300 items and to get rid of the surplus ( about $10 billion ) they have saved up this year . Strauss , after four and a half hours of sweaty work on the Japanese , announced that their offer was " con ? siderably less " than what he regarded as a minimum concession . He is at work on them as this is written . The Germans have not been put through the same public humiliation , presumably because their surplus ( about $1.8 billion ) is smaller and less threatening . America 's trade partners are not being uncooperative out of sheer malice . They are afraid of inflation . When the Japanese and German governments fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , one Treasury official explained , consumers and businessmen begin to fret about inflation . People in these countries are very prudent to begin with . One estimate is that the Japanese save on the average a quarter of their income , while Americans save one twentieth . In addition , the Japanese live with a higher rate of inflation , about 8.5 percent a year . America now has an annual rate of inflation of around 6.5 percent , while Germany has only four percent . All of this makes it difficult to fire up consumer appetites . Last of all , the German and Japanese economies are entirely depen ? dent on imported OPEC oil . The US is 50-percent self-sufficient , meaning that half of its oil payments are recycled through the US economy , not tucked away in OPEC 's mattresses . When oil prices go up , the US does not suffer nearly as much as do other industrial countries . The German and Japanese economies are more fragile and much more sensitive to nil inflation than ours is . That is why they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic business . But they have been given no choice . What will happen next year if the Blumenthal plan succeeds ? Our allies will fire up their economies and inspire their citizens to buy more goods . Exports to the US may decline . Currency traders may stop betting against the dollar . But the big leak in the system will not have been plugged . That leak ? the flow of dollars , yen , deutsche marks , pounds and francs into the bank accounts of a few OPEC nations ? not only will continue but probably will get bigger . The Germans and Japanese will continue to import oil . If their economies grow , they may even want more of it next year than they used this year . That raises a curious problem . How will Germany and Japan pay for next year 's oil if they can not earn money by selling goods to the US ? They can not sell goods to the oil suppliers , because the suppliers simply ca n't buy things fast enough to make up the difference . They ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather put the money in mattresses . What will happen ? Germany and lapin will either find new customers for their exports or go into debt , like everyone else . That 's a puzzle Blumenthal can work on when the dollar stops its slide . Kenneth Curtis has tendered his resignation as chairman of the Democratic National Committee . When he told the President he was packing it in , Mr. Carter asked if there was anything else he 'd like to do in the administration , and Curtis said no thanks . The quiet , genial former governor is going home to Maine to practice law and get some peace of mind . Next to Bert Lance , Curtis is the highest ranking administration official to depart . In announcing his resignation , he was faithful to the Washington ethic : leave quietly , keep your discontent to yourself and maybe you 'll get to come back on a better day to a better job . Curtis also tried to preserve the impression that he was not being forced out , which technically is true . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is leaving town a lot sooner than he ever intended , and with his reputation a bit tarnished . It 's also true that his year on the job was filled with more confrontation and backbiting than he ever anticipated . And it 's by no means certain that the undoing of Kenneth Curtis will alleviate the problems that led to it . One problem at the DNC is money . It 's not unusual For the Democrats to be in debt ; throughout the Nixon-Ford years , they saw nothing but red ink . What is unusual is for the party in the White House to be unable to raise money , which is the case right now . At the Republican National Committee arid the Republican Campaign Committee , things are going along swimmingly ? so well in fact that the GOP expects to be able to provide 1978 congressional candidates with the maximum contributions allowable under the law . Under Bill Brock , the RNC has begun new efforts to spot races where a party investment will pay off , and to reach potential black voters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats will be able to do . They may he right . Meanwhile at the DNC , the debt is $2.5 million , big-event fundraisers at both ends of the country recently came up short of expectations and returns from a direct mail appeal signed by President Carter and sent unpropitiousty just before the holidays are running below projections . Party bigwigs have been asked to guarantee notes to meet the payroll , and when Curtis resigned , 20 staffers were notified they are out of work after the first of the year . At the same time , Newsday reported that Joel McCleary , 29-year-old Carterite who was installed as DNC treasurer , is drawing a $1000 monthly clothing allowance ( on top of a salary of$3o,000 ) . McClean ; needs the extra money , it is said , so that he can dress well enough to Era tern , with Democratic fat cats . According to DNC ? Iders , McClearv 's fundraising operations are costing out at about 50 to bC1 cents for every dollar raised . But McCleary was appointed by Carter , not Curtis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the DNC will do nothing to help the financial bind . Democratic contributors , particularly Jewish con tributors stunned by the President 's Middle East contortions , are unhappy with Carter , not Curtis . Another of the beefs against the outgoing chairman was that compared to his flashy predecessor Robert Strauss , Curtis made democracy too easy . Consider the Panama Canal debacle , which apparently contributed to Curtis ' unpopularity at the White House . To offset a resolution rejecting the treaties orchestrated by Reagan ites on the Republican National Committee , the White House drafted a resolution of full support for the October meeting of the DNC . Evidently , the purpose of the resolution was to prop up some wavering Democratic senators who are looking for support on a tough vote wherever they can find it . At the connivance of the Canal Zone delegation and with the support of DNC members from the Deep South ( where a little White House lobbying might have helped ) the resolu ? tion was watered down . What came out was a statement of support for " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a partial rejection of the President 's position . For that , Curtis took the rap ? too easygoing , too ineffectual , it was said . But it was a bum rap . The idea for an essentially meaningless endorsement of the treaties originated in the White House . If it ran into trouble , the White House , not Curtis , had the obligation to lobby it through the DNC . They sought a victory they did n't need and wound up with a defeat made more embarrassing by the attempt to make Curtis the scapegoat . There is a lesson from the Panama Canal episode , but it has nothing to do with Kenneth Curtis . This is simply not the same national committee apparatus that operated at presidential whim in the days of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson . It has tripled in size , it 's more democratically constituted and selected , all meetings are open to press and public , and regular financial reports are a required part of the agenda . Most of the current members were not " charter Carterites " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of rubber stamp . In short , over the past eight years , DNC members have grown used to having their say and being listened to . Give a body like this a chance to register itself on matters of national policy , and the White House had better be prepared to take its lumps regardless of whom it installs as chairman . When Curtis arrived , he had assurances from the President that the DNC was his show to run . But the in-party chairmanship has always been a caretaker slot ,
