Even though it is based on Einstein 's general relativity equations , the concept strains belief . If a star is large enough - at least three times as massive as the sun-it will eventually die in a grand cataclysm . As its nuclear fires begin to burn out , the stellar gases , no longer supported by heat and radiation , begin falling toward the star 's core . Moving at tremendous velocities , they crush together , forming a sphere only two or three miles across , so dense that each cubic inch of material weighs trillions of tons . The small sphere has a gravitational field so strong that no radiation - even light-can escape from what has become a totally invisible " black hole . " <P> If the theory is correct , there could be countless black holes among the billions of stars in every galaxy . But if no light or other radiation can escape from the bizarre objects , how can astronomers prove that they really exist ? The answer may lie in the constellation Cygnus ( The Swan ) , where scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . Its presence was hinted at in 1971 by the first earth-orbiting X-ray satellite Uhuru , which detected a strong and widely fluctuating flow of X rays from Cygnus . Scientists suspected that the radiation source , which they named Cygnus Xl , was a pulsar , or neutron star , the result of a different form of stellar collapse . But the uneven fluctuations bore no resemblance to the steady bursts of radiation from other pulsars . <P> Shortly thereafter , radio astronomers , using their more sharply focused antennas , picked up radio signals from the area . That gave a much more precise fix on Cygnus Xl , letting other astronomers train big optical telescopes on the site . There they found a huge star , a so-called class-B supergiant , at least 20 times as massive as the sun . It was traveling erratically through space , as if it were being tugged by a smaller companion star moving around it . From this gravitational pull , astronomers figured that the unseen star had at least three times the mass of the sun . <P> Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoreticians had suggested that if a black hole were orbiting a larger , visible star , it would draw gases from the star . As those gases spiraled toward the black hole , they would collide , compress and heat up to as high as 100 million degrees-enough to produce an intense flow of X rays . Recent findings by NASA 'S new Copernicus earth satellite strongly support this scenario . Cygnus X-l shows a sharp decrease in X-ray emissions every 5.6 days . That , according to optical astronomers , seems to be the time it takes the bright star 's unseen companion to make one trip around it . In other words , every 5.6 days the black hole passes behind the visible star . Thus , the supergiant partially blocks the X rays , resulting in the fluctuations observed on earth . <P> The combined calculations and observations add up to the best proof yet that a black hole has been found .
