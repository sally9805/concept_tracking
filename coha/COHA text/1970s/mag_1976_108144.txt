The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their meat from God .  --  PSALMS 104:21 // It seems just like any other college basketball game . The gym is well filled with students and alumni , and a pep band is accompanying some pretty cheerleaders who wear pleated skirts and saddle shoes and wave pompons for the home team . The visitors are not well represented . They have taken the date for a guarantee of only $350 , a fifth of what another team would demand . They are accompanied only by a handful of rooters and the word of God . The visitors have come to play and preach . // They are down four at the half . The home team , Loyola Marymount University of Los Angeles , departs for its locker room , there to rest and to drink in new strategies . The visitors , Athletes In Action , do not leave the floor . Instead , they retire to their bench and put on snappy sweat suits of immaculate white , with red and blue trim , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below them . Athletes In Action stands for Christ and country alike , and its founder , Dave Hannah , not only desires that the players represent a God-fearing America but that they become the finest amateur team upon the earth . It is Hannah 's view , and the prevailing one in these Christian precincts , that infidels will not listen to losers . The AIA wrestling team was the 1975 national champion . The most powerful AIA basketball unit , the one playing Loyola , beat one Top Ten college team last season and played others to the wire . It finished the year 30-7-8 , all road games , and won the national AAU title . It hardly matters that God in His wisdom has not seen fit to bless AIA with any good big guards . // In a moment , four of the AIA players arise , and with their coach , Bill Oates , move to a microphone set up at the far end of the gym . Oates explains that his men will tell the crowd about " the most fantastic Individual the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute , leads off . The theme of his two-minute talk is that " God loves and accepts us just as we are . " The fans  --  those who have not already shuffled out for Cokes  --  listen in grudging silence at first , but quickly grow dubious or bored with the pitch and begin to chatter among themselves . Soon , it is difficult to hear the message . Irv Kiffin , the best Athletes In Action player this evening , speaks next , reminding the listeners of Romans 6:23  --  " The wages of sin is death . " // Tim Hall , a 6 ' 8 " forward who played at Colorado State , follows , but over the rising crowd murmurs his words are almost lost , and when the Loyola team comes back onto the floor , the first player dribbles right past the speakers and shoots a practice layup before , embarrassed , he realizes that he is intruding on something . Nonplussed , Hall goes on , informing the crowd that he has seen a goodly number of collegians " turn to alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . " He says that he found Jesus Christ instead . // John Sears is the clean-up speaker . Each game a different set of AIA players " disciple , " the most forceful and articulate being saved for last . Sears is in his third year with Athletes In Action . He is 26 , married , and has two small children . On the court he is a front-line reserve of little distinction , but at 6 ' 7 " , 215 , he is lean and rugged , a magnificently handsome man , and at least now the women in the audience pay attention , if for the wrong reasons . Sears sums up and offers a prayer . Politely , heads are lowered , kind of . " Thank you , Jesus , for coming into my life , " he says . // When the crowd looks up , Mike Gratzke , the assistant coach , has taken over the microphone . He asks the spectators to fill out comment cards . These are passed out by young volunteers who carry them ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the cards are boxes to check . For example , " I would like more information on how I can grow in my Christian faith . " This knowledge is available and will be sent through the mail . Last year 125,000 people used these cards . // The second half begins and , despite having two starters out with ankle sprains , AIA catches Loyola and wins in the final three minutes . Maybe the fans would have listened to the message more attentively at halftime if AIA had been ahead then , too . " We need to win to command respect , " John Sears says . But he goes on to emphasize that he could see some people watching him intently when he spoke ; a few , he suggested , appeared so interested that he thought they might take Christ into their lives straightaway . He adds that the speakers are paid much better attention in the Midwest and South . // Dave Lower comes into the locker room and , truly excited , says that someone has just informed him that a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us . " The players are obviously moved by this news . Coach Oates suggests they pray . // The men speak up , one by one ; heads are bowed . The thoughts are genuine , spontaneous , even disarming . " Father , " each begins . The first player thanks Him for the coach , for his guidance . Next , the coach thanks Him for the team , for its noble character . The manager asks His forgiveness for getting upset at an official 's call . Another player prays that the injured ankles be quickly healed . Another prays that their halftime message was accepted . Another says , " And , Father , thank you for the win . " It puts AIA at 11-4 for the year . // It is regularly said ( if a bit too easily ) that sport has become the religion of America . This is a glib appraisal , and probably no more accurate than Marx ' equally facile assessment of religion , that it is " the opiate of the people . " The claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to the nagging awareness that something has happened to Sunday . With all the other cultural revolutions in the country , the Sunday revolution has been overlooked , but it has been as thoroughgoing as any . // Throughout American history , going back to Cotton Mather and beyond , Sunday was tightly structured and well defined as a day of peace : worship in the morning , then a heavy meal , leavened with the fellowship of the entire family , followed by rest and rumination . In Ragtime , the best-selling novel set at the turn of the century , E. L. Doctorow has selected Sunday to evoke the mood for the era . In his first paragraph , he writes , " On Sunday afternoon , after dinner , Father and Mother went upstairs and closed the bedroom door . Grandfather fell asleep on the divan in the parlor . The Little Boy in the sailor blouse sat on the screened porch and waved away the flies . " Forty years later the Japanese chose Sunday as our soft underbelly . It became a Hollywood clich ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor  --  the family was always in the living room , knitting , perusing the funny papers , playing dominoes and whatnot . Grandfather was dozing on the divan . Thus , for our first 300 years , was Sunday , the Lord 's day . // If Pearl Harbor came now , in 1976 , where would people learn of it ? On the tennis court , at a bar watching Demolition Derby on CBS , at the arena ? There is no time for the family or for lunch . Grandfather is in front of his Sony , with a take-out Whopper , French fries and a six-pack , screaming his fool head off because he gave 6 ? and took the Oilers . After three centuries , Sunday changed overnight . Have we forgotten that until very recently baseball never dared play Sunday night games lest they conflict with vespers ? Coincidence or not , the last great religious boom in America came in the mid-1950s , and the decline in church attendance , which set in thereafter , took place just as pro football , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Now , the trip out of the house on Sunday is not to visit a church , but to see a game or to play one . At most Roman Catholic churches , where regular attendance traditionally is highest , convenient Saturday afternoon services are now featured so that communicants can get in a full 18 holes the next morning before returning home for the NBA Game of the Week . At Notre Dame these Saturday masses have become especially popular on game days , sort of the second half of a doubleheader. // So the churches have ceded Sunday to sports , to games . But we should not be deceived ; that really is not a good indication of the popularity of religion or its place in the U.S. It is just that games defeated prayer in the battle for a day , and that should not come as a surprise , inasmuch as religion does not televise nearly as well as golf and only slightly better than ice hockey . It does not follow that since sport has won Sunday , we have embraced a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our religion , the more people in sport seem to be seeking religion . If anything , sport is less inspirational , less spiritual than ever before . Is God dead ? Well , whatever His present status , the gods of sweat have definitely expired . Babe Ruth , Jack Dempsey and the others in that pantheon were the subjects of childlike idolatry. // Donald Cutler , an Episcopal rector who is also a New York literary agent , says , " Sport in America is more secular than ever . The talk is of money , contracts , litigation . How do you worship something like that ? Put your faith in a team that will be in another city next year ? I grew up living and dying with the Pittsburgh Pirates , listening to recreated games on the radio . Sport had stability then , and one could dare to identify with teams and players . That 's gone . The innocence is gone , the glory . There is nothing in the experience to lift us up , no heroes to idolize . Hank Aaron a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic hero in sport , I suppose . Jack Nicklaus is merely a money-winner . That is what we have left : money-winners . And you do not worship those . " // And yet , as the American reverence for the saints of sport declines , religion itself has increasingly become a handmaiden to sport . Clergymen are standing in line to cater to the spiritual needs of the deprived athletic elite , and the use of athletes as amateur evangelists is so widespread that it might be fairly described as a growth industry . " Jocks for Jesus " is what The Wittenburg Door , an acerbic contemporary religious magazine , derisively calls the movement . " Who gives these people authority but the pagan world in which we live ? " asks the magazine , its cover adorned with an athletic supporter festooned with a cross . But Jocks for Jesus is booming . It is almost as if a new denomination had been created : Sportianity . While Christian churches struggle with problems of declining attendance , falling contributions and now even reduction in membership , Sportianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league baseball and football team  --  all 50 of them  --  holds Sunday chapel services , home and away . Many teams have their own ministers . Pat Jantomaso , a Red Sox chapel speaker , who lives in Boca Raton , Fla. but joins the team virtually every Sunday on the road , says , " Many are caring for down-and-outers , but I decided to minister to up-and-outers . " Sunday services are also held in sports as varied as stock-car racing and golf . In many cases , week-night Bible classes have been started up so that wives may participate . // Athletes In Action has 250 full-time staff men ( domestic missionaries , really ) . Eight are assigned to large cities where their only job is to minister to the pro athletes . Athletes In Action deploys two proselyting basketball teams , two wrestling teams , plus squads in gymnastics , track and weight lifting . With the AIA teams , the major thrust is toward the colleges . Says Greg Hicks , a 1974 national AAU wrestling champion and an AIA assistant athletic director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an athlete , I can get into a fraternity , a locker room , where nobody else would be permitted . " // Sports Ambassadors is an overseas equivalent of the AIA . Since 1952 , " in a world gone berserk with sports , " it has sent basketball and baseball teams into more than 40 countries in Europe , the Orient , Africa and Central and South America , playing and preaching under the organization 's name or Venture For Victory . A newcomer in the field is the basketball team known as News Release , which carries its pray-for-play ministry to Europe , even behind the Iron Curtain . // The Fellowship of Christian Athletes , which is the patriarch of Sportianity , does not subsidize teams , but uses older athletes to bring younger ones to Christ , mainly at summer sports camps ( $110 a week ) and in high school group sessions known as " Huddles . " The FCA 's annual budget is $2.2 million , and its president , John Erickson , refers to it as a " para-church. " // For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fellowship  --  which bills itself as the " muscle and action " of Christianity  --  operates as a powerful lobby when one of its member coaches is up against an outsider for a job . As a result , there are coaches who feel that they have to protect themselves by signing on as FCA members . " It 's like getting a union card , " says one . " If you do n't join , some coaches in the Fellowship will bad-mouth you with kids they 're recruiting , tell ' em you 're a drunk or your marriage is breaking up . I know , because kids I 've recruited told me. " // Another substantial organization , Pro Athletes Outreach , was founded largely as an intramural peace-keeping force because the giants of Sportianity , AIA and FCA , were squabbling so indecorously over enlisting the best missionary athletes . It was an outgrowth of Sports World Chaplaincy , Inc. but is now a thriving operation with an annual budget of $250,000 , and it sends phalanxes of pros off on what it calls " speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flag football games , tugs-of-war , wrist-wrestling and other fun games . // The movement has grown so that it has even spawned a think tank , the Institute for Athletic Perfection , which formulates dogma for athletic religion . Moreover , the presses of Sportianity are flooding the market with pamphlets , books , newsletters , magazines , even comic books and films ( A Man &amp; His Men , featuring Tom Landry .... " The thrill of victory , the agony of defeat , the impact of a Christian life " ) . Athletes In Action sends out taped vignettes and interviews that have been played on more than 150 radio stations . It established a national television network for its top basketball team this past season , with John Wooden mike-side. // Sport and religion were not total strangers before all this began . Billy Sunday , the turn-of-the-century evangelist , was a reformed weak-hitting major league outfielder . Dr. James Naismith was a seminarian before he invented basketball at the YMCA . C. T. Studd , a millionaire British missionary , was the progenitor of groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player who agreed to make a tour of army garrisons in India if he could preach after his innings . And remember Deacon Dan Towler ? The Vaulting Vicar , Bob Richards ? The House of David baseball team ? Other athletes went on to the ministry when their playing days were done : Albie Pearson , Donn Moomaw , Henry Carr . Bill Glass , the former All-Pro end , is now one of the nation 's top evangelists . Jerry Lucas , whose previous enterprises included fast food and magic , has opened up Memory Ministries , a nonprofit organization that will instruct the nimble-minded , for a $20 fee , in memorizing all 89 chapters of the four Gospels . Lucas ' new book , Remember The Word , has sold almost 60,000 copies . // But religion rarely intruded into sport in the past except in the occasional instance of a player who refused to perform on a holy day  --  Sandy Koufax was probably the most famous and most recent . Hank Greenberg was another . But Cassius Clay 's conversion to the Black Muslims provoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar found his life endangered when he was caught in the middle of an interdenominational Muslim war . Alvin Dark  --  " Preacher Dark " and " Sister Dark " to Charles Finley  --  lost his job as manager of Finley 's A 's in large part for taking to a pulpit and suggesting that his boss would go to hell if he did n't let Christ enter his heart . A few Muslims claim that certain Jewish basketball owners have blackballed some of them because of the Arab-Israeli conflict . Some teams , notably the 1974 Kansas City Chiefs , have been disrupted by overzealous God Squadders trying to push hellfire and brimstone on the whole team . // That religion should suddenly be a factor in sport while its influence elsewhere is declining is not the paradox it seems . Certain members of the religious community have quite openly set out to mine athletics . The belief in these ecclesiastical pockets is that athletes need special spiritual assistance , that they are especially vulnerable to preaching and , finally and most important , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold . Addressing the Cincinnati Reds at chapel at Fenway Park during the World Series last October , the Rev. Billy Zeoli , the biggest individual star in Sportianity , told the players , " I hope you have a concept of how much you affect people , how they look up to you . Let me remind you that your national influence on youth is greater than that of any single pastor , priest or rabbi . " // Arlis Priest , the head of Pro Athletes Outreach , is convinced that athletes can strongly influence moral and religious life in the United States . Among the sincere , dedicated men in athletic religion , surely none is more sincere or dedicated than Priest . Converted in a foxhole in France ( " Every man I saw die talked about mother or God " ) , Priest is known as Uncle Arlis to the 90 or so NFL players who form the heart of his organization . Priest was a baseball aspirant before World War II , good enough to merit a Double A tryout ; afterward , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lay ministry . Now gray-haired and distinguished , he is a dead ringer for Harry Reasoner . At PAO headquarters near Phoenix , Priest speaks evenly , almost dispassionately , but there is conviction and emotion in what he says . He explains how athletes are crucial to saving America : // " We 're losing . We 've lost our perspective , turning to drugs , free sex  --  and did you know there are now 26,000 suicides a year ? And here we are , more blessed than any nation in the history of the world . Do we really think we 're that much smarter that we can turn away from God ? Well , professional athletes can reach the people who want to find God , who want to be Christians , but do n't know how to . Particularly the young people  --  they 'll listen to athletes . Pros have the right background . Why , they 're probably the most disciplined group of people left in this country . They 're dedicated , they 're taught to play as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what we need in America . // " Two years from now I expect to have half the professional athletes as Christians . Yes , half . I will be disappointed if we do n't have half . And then , as Romans 1:16 says , the power is in the Gospel , and it is the athletes in our society who can best carry that message . " // Like Priest , virtually all the leaders in the Christian athletic movement are fundamentalist . Organizations such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Athletes In Action are studiously nondenominational , and even the individual stalwarts , ministers like Zeoli and Tom Skinner ( who is associated with the Washington Redskins ) , avoid mentioning their particular church affiliation . Evangelistic Catholicism has been under steam for almost a decade , and this has helped bring Roman Catholic recruits from that wing of the church into Sportianity  --  Mike McCoy of the Green Bay Packers is one Catholic invariably cited . But the sense and thrust of the movement still comes from the Bible Belt . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , all or nothing ; there is no truck with intellectualizing , the appeal is gut . It does not seem surprising that football  --  authoritarian , even militaristic  --  is the sport at the heart of the movement . The pregame football chapel services are important not so much because they take place on the Sabbath , but because they take place on a game day , when the players are sky high and emotionally exposed . A pro star who once was active in Sportianity but left in disgust says , " Why do you think this simplistic type of religion appeals to athletes ? Because you 're talking to people who operate primarily with their bodies , not their minds . " // Ray Hildebrand was a pop singer who had one big hit ( Hey Paula ) before he gave up show business to work for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes . He has had all the spotlights he ever wanted and so is not awed by hotshot athletes . As a matter of fact , the best way to preach to athletes , to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pros have got so much flash themselves , " Hildebrand says , " that the only way you 're going to impress them is to throw flash at them . You got to come on strong , joking , and then you give them what we call ' three points and a poem '  --  No. 1 , No. 2 , No. 3 and a simple little rhyme to wrap it up for ' em . " Hildebrand smiles and shakes his head at this foolishness . " Sometimes I 'll even wear one of those silly shirts . " // Being essentially fundamentalist , the movement draws its strength from the South and the rural areas of the nation where that type of theology has thrived . Despite its growth and clout , the Fellowship of Christian Athletes has failed to make inroads into the more sophisticated areas of the nation . There are now 1,600 high school Huddles in the U.S. , but only a dozen of these  --  .8% of the total  --  are located in the Northeast , where 15% of the population resides . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Huddles are found in the South , Southwest and Midwest , and most of the stars who participate in the program were brought up in those areas , in white , middle-class environs. // The FCA has sought to broaden its reach but has failed , in large part because in the more urban ( and allegedly liberal ) sections of the nation , school officials often seem intimidated by laws concerned with the separation of church and state . Because it is a religious organization , the FCA has been denied access to some schools . Those in Sportianity consider this " discriminatory " and absurd  --  as preposterous as viewing registered Democrats and Republicans as agents of political prejudice . There have been instances when the PAO speaking caravan has been permitted into a school auditorium and allowed to address students , but only if the players promised not to use any names . Accordingly , they say things like : " My life was changed by "  --  and here they offer a longing look skyward  --  " by someone whose name I ca n't mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relatively new . Previously , only Roman Catholics exploited athletics , using football and basketball teams to attract students and funds and attention to parochial institutions that were broke and often academically inferior as well . The classic example is Notre Dame . // Father James Riehle , the chaplain of the Notre Dame athletic department , says , " Of course Catholic schools used athletics for prestige . Notre Dame would not be the great school it is today , the great academic institution , were it not for football . But the emphases have changed here . I think that now we realize the value of sport in more ways than just the financial , whereas I 'm afraid once we didn't. " // The famous upset of Army by Notre Dame in 1913 , when Knute Rockne ( a Protestant then , but who knew ? ) trundled out a secret weapon known as the forward pass , had broad religious implications . Football had been an upper-class WASP sport played by the moneyed few in the Northeast . They had adapted the game from English soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urban immigrants , who were predominantly Catholic , took to it precisely because it was all-American and was not at all British . Major league baseball was limited pretty much to those large cities with heavy Catholic populations , while college football thrived and became preeminent in the more homogeneous Protestant sections of the country , particularly the South and Southwest . // So the Irish of Notre Dame used football to move up in the academic community in the same way that the lace-curtain Irish used politics to ascend in society . The Notre Dame example was followed by other Catholic schools , but in 1976 only the Irish and Boston College remain in the football big time . Because Catholic colleges were chiefly located downtown , with limited physical and financial resources , they eventually were forced to drop football and concentrate on basketball . // The Catholic emphasis on this sport continues despite a more recent phenomenon  --  basketball 's increasing domination by blacks . Since relatively few blacks are Roman Catholic , parochial schools have had to recruit outside the faith if they wished to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 90% or more Catholic but the basketball squad is virtually non-Catholic . Catholic academicians do not see any hypocrisy in this policy , equating it with a state-supported school recruiting out-of-state players . // Because of this de-Catholicization of Catholic teams , it is now rare to see a player crossing himself before shooting a free throw . It may not be frivolous to suggest that this practice was responsible for a goodly share of the anti-Catholic sentiment in the land . Jack Kennedy might have won by a landslide in 1960 but for the fact that Catholics were , at that time , still crossing themselves before shooting free throws . No matter what devout reasons Catholics had for making the sign , non-Catholics ( Protestants especially ) were always convinced that , deep down , the free-throw shooter was asking God to curl it in for him . // Says Father Charles Riepe , rector of the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore and president of John Carroll School , " It 's much to the good that the practice has largely disappeared . We had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sophisticated boy , too , who was crossing himself before foul shots . I took him aside and suggested , as nicely as possible , that it might be wise to drop that . If you want to cross yourself , I told him , it 's the kind of thing you can do in private before a game  --  and really , once beforehand should be quite sufficient to cover all the eventualities in both halves . Besides , as I also told him , " Father Riepe adds , laughing , " it looks awful when you do blow a free throw . Then it appears that God really does have it in for you and John Carroll . " // The de-mythification of sport , leading to the demise of the hero , may be a major reason why fundamentalists have taken the ball from the Roman Catholics . In the palmy days of yore , when order reigned over innocent games , sport was uplifting and a glorious celebration , like the mass . Sport and the church both stood for authority ; the reserve clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heroes were larger than life , canonized as athletic saints , a comfortable adjunct to the church 's own hagiology . The Roman church has always been perturbed by sex , and for its male adolescents , joining a team was considered the next best thing to a vow of celibacy . As long as budding young ladies could be kept in what the sisters called " Mary-like " clothes , and growing boys could be kept shagging flies and shooting set shots , nobody would have time to think impure thoughts , much less do impure things to one another . Anyway , that was the idea . // Even today , arbitrary pregame football team rites are heavily laced with Catholic taboo and mysticism . Dr. William Arens , the anthropologist , compares these peculiar ceremonial group devotions to " the exotic rituals of a newly discovered tribe . " The belief that sex should be avoided before a game , the determination to keep the players segregated ( ideally , watching action movies ) , the participation in a final meal together ( a shared communion of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchly concepts . // Still , it is not football but organized baseball that has the most Roman Catholic trappings . With its grand traditions , its constancy , its statistical litany , baseball could be neatly comprehended by the church  --  and it was . The baseball hierarchy does not take civil government as its model , but has an ecclesiastical design , beginning with the commissioner-pope , who is elected by the owners-cardinals , right on down to the fans-parishioners  --  indeed , the word fan is derived from " fanatic . " The Baseball Hall of Fame closely approximates a Catholic shrine , which , of course , is exactly what it is called . // How ever deep their involvement with athletics , Catholics have always looked upon them as a diversion , rather like Tuesday night Bingo in the parish hall . Certainly , sport was never viewed as any sort of vehicle for conversion ; athletics had nothing to do with theology . Football made Notre Dame a top-notch school , but the fact that Notre Dame was Catholic was quite incidental . If an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the ball and never mind what he does with his Sunday mornings ; if the best coach we can get is Protestant and Ara Parseghian wants the job , hire him . To Catholics , sport might be important , but it was never churchy . The clearest embodiment of Catholic athletic philosophy was the late Father Tom Brennan of Notre Dame . A serious theologian , a man of intellect , he could also serve as pastor to young Irish athletes . He was a fine athlete himself and a whimsical man who enjoyed dry martinis , which would sometimes lead to his conducting telephone conversations ( presumably imaginary ) with the devil . Sport appealed to Father Brennan  --  its joy , its fellowship and just because it could be so exciting . He liked to sit on the Irish bench , and he did not always agree with the way officials saw matters . One night , in Evansville , he began riding a referee . He got on the poor fellow pretty hard , but the referee was reluctant to call a technical on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennan , shook a finger at him and said , " Come on , Father , you call the Mass , and I 'll call the game . " Catholics still roar appreciatively at this tale . // In contrast to the Catholic attitude , the Sportians , humorless and persevering , appear to be attracted to sport as an evangelical device that can be used baldly and also because , as an institution , sport is going to hell just like the rest of the country . All the talk in sport is cynical  --  of money , money , money , drugs and camp followers , dissension and dissatisfaction . Sin ! Today 's best-known white athlete is Joe Namath , whose womanizing and drinking are broadly publicized . It is said that his celebrated example provided some of the impetus for the Sportian movement . // Sportians are out to save sport by saving athletes . Once they are converted , they are cast as neo-crusaders . The field is to be an altar , the game a sacrifice . Paul Neumann , a Sports Ambassadors official who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A Christian is always keyed up before a game because he knows he is playing for his real coach . " Alvin Dark goes further , suggesting everything he does is for the glory of Jesus Christ . In the sermon in which he revealed Charlie Finley 's fiery future , Dark also said , " The more we read the Bible , the more we begin to turn our lives over to the Lord . For example , I gave the Lord my golf game . When I dedicated my life ... one of the first things I did was turn my golf game over to the Lord . " // Jesus has been transformed , emerging anew as a holler guy , a hustler , a give-it-100-percenter . While students of the new religion glumly acknowledge that his only known athletic performance was throwing the moneychangers out of the temple , Jesus ' sad , desperate last hours have become a kind of Super Bowl . Wes Neal , previously with AIA , left that organization to set up the Institute for Athletic Perfection in Prescott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement ; the pamphlets published by the institute are handed out by many Sportian groups . // The new image of Jesus , the blue-chipper , is set forth in a Neal tract entitled Total Release Performance , which refers to the brand of ball that Jesus played on the cross : " It was another situation that would reveal his WINNING character .... At any point Jesus could have turned back from His mission , but He was a WINNER ! " TO prove that Jesus had guts , the physical effects of being crucified are described in gory detail . Apparently , this is to shame athletes into competing more intently , whatever their injuries , their limitations or frame of mind . The crucifixion becomes an athletic sacrament , and athletes are asked to be martyrs . Without equivocation , the Institute lists as " SIN " such things as " failure to reach maximum athletic potential " and " fear of an opponent . " // Clearly , the trickiest thing in mixing religion with sport is the matter of asking God for victory . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is quite common for athletes to get carried away and to pray precisely for that . " He 's just an overly enthusiastic baby Christian , " Billy Zeoli , the inspirational chapel speaker , said after a pro football player came flat-out in pregame prayers and asked Jesus to give his team a win . " Please do n't get on him . " Zeoli , however , felt it was unnecessary to discuss the impropriety of a victory prayer with the player . The line can be a fine one . When Kermit Zarley , one of the outspoken Christians on the PGA tour , won the Canadian Open a few years ago , he credited his success to God for having found him a new driver . Now , if that was not quite like saying that God hit tee shots for Kermit Zarley , the implication was clear that Zarley won the Canadian Open because God hung around pro shops with him when he was hunting for new clubs . Regrettably , whatever Sportianity is trying to project , the public often has another impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a victory are Pharisees , thanking God , paying Him off for getting them another big one in the W column . A poll of young Christian athletes , teen-agers who have been specifically instructed by the movement , asked , " What does it mean to be a Christian athlete ? " The response most often received was , " To have God on my side . " Jesus , it seems , is coming across as the next best thing to a home-court advantage . // At the same time , no one in the movement advises athletes to pray for victory . On the contrary , the try ethic , epitomized by Christ 's Total Release Performance at Gethsemane on Maundy Thursday , is almost universally taught . The message is virtually the same all over : try your hardest , and then , win or lose , you will not be in conflict with Christian tenets . The favorite scripture comes from Paul , who is heard so regularly that he has become rather like the Curt Gowdy of Sportianity  --  and not only because both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorsement of competition and Total Release Performance is found in 1 Corinthians 9:24 , which quotes him thus in a modern paraphrase text of the New Testament : " Surely you know that in a race all the runners take part in it , but only one of them wins the prize . Run , then , in such a way as to win the prize . " Also cited regularly are Paul 's familiar words from 2 Timothy 4:7 : " I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith . " Unfortunately , Paul 's most direct statement about athletics ( 1 Timothy 4:7-8 ) does not fit in Sportianity , so it is never quoted : " ... exercise thyself rather unto godliness . For bodily exercise profiteth little . " // Malcolm Boyd , Episcopal priest and author of the best-seller Are You Running With Me , Jesus ? , replies to the try ethic , " If you 're into triumphalism as a theory , then it follows that the important thing to you is to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're merely trying . You feel that God is on your side . You may not pray those words , but you ca n't tell me it 's not in your heart  --  whether it 's Vietnam we 're talking about or Ohio State . // " Who was that swimmer  --  you know , the Olympic guy ? Yes , right  --  Mark Spitz . Is n't that funny how quickly we 've forgotten him ? I 'll tell you why  --  I 'll tell you when he lost all respect : at the very instant he reached his peak , when he crawled out of the water after his last gold medal and said he never wanted to swim again . // " What is the point of swimming , of doing anything , just for the sake of trying to win ? Certainly , Jesus did n't want that , and it is audacious for these guys to say it . In Gethsemane , and there hanging on the cross , Jesus did n't ask to win . In fact , his thoughts turned to the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trying nonsense . I 've seen so many kids wounded by it . It is this kind of trying , the kind that this athletic religion teaches , which is killing off so many men , leaving widows . It is very dangerous right now to be trying harder . It is making us more machinelike instead of more human . We 'd do better to learn how not to try so . " // The Sportians stick close to a you-and-Jesus , one-on-one theology . " Do n't allow your group to stray too far off course from the Christ theme , " the FCA advises its leaders ( Tip No. 5 ) . Don Cutler disagrees with the movement 's lack of social concern : " If the New Testament says anything , it is that this man poured Himself out for you , and now it is your responsibility to pour yourself out for others . It is not a question of His taking care of you , whatever  --  your having no obligations other than signing up for the big Christian team . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dotted-line converts ( sign here , raise your hand , send for literature ) , is sport itself . In the process of dozens of interviews with people in Sportianity , not one even remotely suggested any direct effort was being considered to improve the morality of athletics . An active churchman , who has long been involved in pro sport , says , " The trouble with these people is that they worship sport as much as they do Jesus . They are so thrilled to be working with hotshot stars that they can see nothing wrong with athletics . They do n't want to . I 'm afraid that it is not religion that has come into sport , but athletic groupies. " // More than a decade ago a deeply religious pitcher named Allan Worthington protested that he would quit the Chicago White Sox unless the club stopped stealing opponents ' signals by illegal means . Since that time players in all leagues have struck righteously for more money , more benefits , more power . But not until five months ago , when Bobby Hull refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the violence in his sport and in fear that someone might be killed , has a single player dared put himself publicly on the line against something he considered ethically remiss . // Sportianity casts stones at players like Joe Namath for personal behavior . Dave Hannah of Athletes In Action is still angry that Lance Rentzel was doing work in Sportianity at a time when he was having deep psychological disturbances ; Hannah thinks that Rentzel was inconsiderate in bringing such bad sexual publicity to the movement . But no one in the movement  --  much less any organization  --  speaks out against the cheating in sport , against dirty play ; no one attacks the evils of recruiting , racism or any of the many other well-known excesses and abuses . Sport owns Sunday now , and religion is content to lease a few minutes before the big games . Religion seems to have become a support force for athletics , like broadcasters , trainers , cheerleaders and ticket-sellers . John Morley , a British statesman , wrote , " Where it is a duty to worship the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the laws of heat . " As long as it can work the territory , Sportianity seems prepared to accept athletics as is , more devoted to exploiting sport than to serving it .
