Four years after Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia , the Russian presence still dominates the country , in sometimes unexpected ways . Fully 60,000 Soviet troops are stationed there , but Moscow has also poured an estimated $1 billion in aid into Czechoslovakia , in an obvious attempt to buy civil peace , if not the loyalty of the country 's citizens . As a result , a surface prosperity prevails in Prague that contrasts curiously with the mood of Czechoslovaks ; as a nation they remain gripped by apathy and despair . TIME 'S Chief European Correspondent William Rademaekers , who covered Czechoslovakia before the invasion , returned there recently to file this report : <P> Prague is beginning to glitter again after a massive campaign to restore and regild its splendid baroque churches and monuments . Its shop windows are filled with consumer goods imported from the capitalist West as well as from the Communist East . No fewer than 7,000,000 tourists from East Germany and other Soviet-bloc countries swarmed into Czechoslovakia this year in pursuit of luxuries not readily available at home . These include Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaujolais from France , and Czechoslovak brassires and girdles that , at long last , are beginning to encase Russian and East European flab in tough new elastic . <P> One million private cars , including even French-made Simcas as well as Czechoslovakia 's own Skoda , jam the streets and roads of this small nation of 14 million people . Restaurants are packed with Czechoslovak and foreign tourists , swigging Pilsen beer and devouring pork-and fruit-filled dumplings . Perhaps as a result , the Czechoslovaks are now on a physical-fitness kick . One Prague sporting-goods store is doing a thriving business in exercise machines . <P> At the same time , a palpable sense of collective despair permeates the country . The reason is not hard to divine . From all indications , the Russians are there to stay . The Soviets have built permanent barracks for their soldiers , apartment houses for their officers and wives , and schools for Russian children . Certain choice seats are reserved for them at the National Theater and several concert halls . Understandably , the Soviet occupiers avoid mingling with the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often talking in whispers to one another . Even in civilian clothes , Russian soldiers are easily recognized by their crude serge suits , heavily starched shirts and close-cropped hair .
