A probe of the state 's supreme court ends with no charges <P> It began almost a year ago as an attempt to " clear the air " and " restore public confidence . " When it ended last week , it was apparent that an unprecedented and excruciating investigation of the California Supreme Court had not succeeded in achieving either goal . The final report by California 's commission on judicial performance briefly stated that " no formal charges will be filed against any supreme court justice . " It was a less than conclusive judgment and thus left impaired the reputation of a court long considered among the most enlightened in the nation . <P> The commission had set out last January to examine two questions : 1 ) Had the supreme court , as charged in the press , delayed the release of four politically sensitive decisions until after Election Day , 1978 , in order to boost Chief Justice Rose Bird 's chances for confirmation by the voters ? and 2 ) Had any of the justices or members of their staffs leaked word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which printed the story on Election Day ? <P> Bird herself had called for the investigation last Nov. 24 . A liberal 43-year-old activist with no prior judicial experience , she had been opposed by law-and-order conservatives and some of the legal establishment ever since her surprise appointment in 1977 by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr . By last November , under the pressure of allegations of political maneuvering by the court , she decided that something had to be done to restore confidence in the state 's highest tribunal . <P> The commission entrusted with the investigation is composed of five judges appointed by the supreme court , two lawyers named by the governors of the state bar , and two lay people chosen by the Governor . In existence since 1961 to hear complaints and bring charges against wayward judges , it now found itself faced with the ultimate test , a probe of the supreme court . Under instructions from California 's judicial council , the commission was required to conduct a public hearing , and it launched one last June , under the glare of television lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents and took depositions . For the next four weeks , five of the justices and 13 staff members presented a picture of the California Supreme Court as a place where personal pettiness and inefficiency ran rampant . <P> According to the testimony , Bird and Justice Mathew Tobriner , both liberals , frequently had note-taking aides sit in on their conversations with conservative Justice William Clark because they did not trust him . The antagonism between Bird and Clark reached the point where the chief justice refused to speak to either him or his clerks . More important , the testimony indicated that the court 's procedures were slow , cumbersome , even archaic . That view was echoed by Robert Thompson , a former California appeals court justice , who told TIME Correspondent Edward J. Boyer that the court was taking on too many cases for review .
