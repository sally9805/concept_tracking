txt Electric utilities with heavy investment in nuclear power can still find the welcome mat out on Wall Street , but it 's going to cost them plenty . Much of the cloud that the disabled nuclear plant near Harrisburg , Pa .. cast over the credit markets cleared up yesterday as the danger level at the Three Mile Island site was reduced . In the first key test of market reaction , Virginia Electric &; Power Co. found there were more than enough insurance companies , pension funds and other institutions willing to lend it $100 million in exchange for new 10V7 , bonds due in 30 years . However , those investors demanded a steep 10.30% yield , while dealers set an unusually high $9.99 cost per bond to handle the issue . Underwriters will pocket almost $1 million on the sale . That yield was well above an estimated 10.10% return that analysts said may have been set before the nuclear accident in Pennsylvania . For the company , that 's equal to an additional $3.6 million in interest cost over the 18-year average life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late yesterday , all the bonds were sold and the issue rose to a price of 99% bid from 99.538 , the offering price after the bonds were allowed to trade in the free market . That reduced the yield to about 10.28% . The issue 's rapid sellout masked behind-the-scenes activity that produced a tug of war among brokerage firms as they tried to find the right price to lure investors . A group led by Blyth Eastman Dillon &; Co. , which failed to win the issue , thought investors deserved a higher 10.35% return . Even within the winning Morgan Stanley &; Co. syndicate , there was sharp disagreement . Two major members of the group , Dillon , Read &; Co. and Paine , Webber , Jackson &; Curtis Inc. , dropped out when final terms were set . A poll of its customers before the sale gave indications that yields near 10.50% would be needed to attract buyers , Dillon Read said . That was confirmed by one of the nation 's largest insurance companies , which told a reporter that it would n't accept less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 25% of its electricity from nuclear plants . Paine Webber does a large volume of business with individuals . One market specialist said small investors " tend to respond more to headlines of pending nuclear disaster . " As a result , they 're harder to sell than institutions , which take " a broader view . " Institutions see the problem as being contained , he added . Sophisticated investors found another feature , known as a full sinking fund , that makes the issue attractive . That fund retires $4 million of the bonds each year beginning in 1985 . The device tends to protect the bonds from precipitous price declines even in times of rising interest rates . It 's a feature found in many industrial issues but is rare in utility financings . Other corporate issues were marked up as much as 4i. point in the over-the-counter market as price restrictions were lifted on the Virginia Electric issue . In the government sector , prices also climbed as the Treasury auctioned $16 billion of bills under the new $830 billion debt ceiling passed by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . have little direct impact on long-term bonds . Nevertheless . some longer issues were up 11 , point or more , due largely to buying by market professionals . " There comes a time when you get tired of being beansh and psychologically want things to get better . " said one trader , seeking to explain the market 's strength . " It seems to be a temporary uptick , and the market probably will be hit by lower prices again by next week . " In the municipal market , several fresh issues were priced , including $100 million of revenue bonds by Puerto Rico Public Building Authority . That issue , rated Baa-1 by Moody 's and single-A by Standard &; Poor 's , was increased from $80 million initially and will be sold through a group headed by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and First Boston Corp . It 's expected to consist of $74.2 million of bonds due 2004 , tentatively priced at 100 with 7.875% coupons , plus $25.8 million of serial bonds scaled to yield from 5.9% in 1980 to 7.4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wayne Counties , W. Va. , sold out after reaching investors yesterday , E. F. Hutton &; Co. , head underwriter , said . Rated single-A by Moody 's and double-A by Standard &; Poor 's , it consisted of $32.5 million of bonds due 2010 and 2011 , priced at 100 with 7.375% coupons , plus $17.5 million of serial bonds , returning from 5.6% in 1981 to 7.1% in 1999 .
