Of all the hundreds of exhibitions put together by the curators of the Great American art boom ( circa 1962-73 ) , not one tried to give an account of what was being painted in Europe . The reason , as everyone " knew , " was that European art no longer mattered . Paris was over ; London , a village ; only New York had a hammer lock on history . This eminently questionable belief , fathered by chauvinism and fed by the largest promotional apparatus in the history of art , lay at the root of American art politics in the ' 60s and formed the taste of a generation of museumgoers . Now the retreat is on . An exhibition called " European Painting in the ' 70s " opened last week at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . It is the first show of its kind to appear in an American museum since , believe it or not , 1959 . Ably organized by Curator Maurice Tuchman , it consists of 65 paintings by 16 artists . The show will travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 , and to the Elvehjem Art Center in Madison , Wis. , in the summer-but not to New York . <P> It is , of course , impossible to find 16 artists who could represent the full range of style and preoccupation in European art , so Tuchman has restricted his choice mainly to figurative paintings by " loners " - artists who , for one reason or another , have not closely identified themselves with particular groups or movements . Some of the work is familiar to a U.S. audience : the sumptuous paranoia of Francis Bacon 's images ( TIME , April 7 ) basking like altarpieces behind their glittering shields of glass and gold leaf ; the cool , infrangible poise of David Hockney 's still lifes and portraits . Pierre Alechinsky , the Belgian painter , is represented by a group of delectably complex , exuberant paintings , swarming with organic life like microscope slides rendered in calligraphy . There is a group of Sobreteixims by the 82-year-old Joan Miro , hangings woven from thick knotted clumps of rope , charred and then painted with undiminished vitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists are completely unknown in the U.S. : for example , a Dutch eccentric named Anton Heyboer , who lives with three women in a small dark barn north of Amsterdam and , the catalogue gravely assures us , " is timeless and unconscious , like an animal . " Heyboer 's life may have the gray neuralgic minimality of a character in Beckett , and the paintings-schematic outline figures scrawled on a white ground-look negligible . Quite different is the work of a Frenchman , Jean-Olivier Hucleux , who has developed a technique of such extreme verisimilitude as to make nearly all U.S. photo-realism seem clumsy and generalized . His favorite subject is , lit erally , nature morte : French graveyards , with their raked gravel , their cakes of black granite brought to a patent-leather gloss , their iconography of morose kitsch . Hucleux paints them down to the last molecule and the result is a form of trompe l'oeil that contrives to be both meditative and irritating , done with a delicacy of touch that defies analysis .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
