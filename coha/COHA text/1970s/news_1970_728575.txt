txt Letters Letters TERRORISM . LEFT AND RIGHT To THE EDITOR : As a friend and great admirer of Irving Howe , holding a similar political point of view ? if anything a more nonviolent one ? I am saddened by his analysis of the present terrorism by the left ( " Political Terrorism : Hysteria on the Left , " April 12 ) . Mr. Howe ignores a crucial point , a crucial experience that the young people have had in this country : the political terrorism and torture by the right . Nobody knows how many young people have been radicalized by their military experience , either through service or resistance , but I have met literally hundreds of them , and many , perhaps a majority , do not come from the well-heeled homes of which Mr. Howe writes . The blacks have had a very special experience with democracy in this country , an experience of repression and violence . Now the young white generation has been faced with an analogous situation when they do n't go along with prevailing policies . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tortures and killings that go on in prison camps here and abroad under the traditional names of stockades and brigs . They know that it is not , as Mr. Howe puts it , with seeming innocence that we simply ally ourselves with the barbaric regime in Athens , but that we made that regime possible . There is a group of young radicals who are nonviolent . With great difficulty and perseverance they started a coffeehouse in Wrightstown , N.J. They never threw a bomb , nor did they believe in such tactics . They were continually harrassed by the right . The man who rented them their little building was threatened , and his child was threatened . The coffeehouse was broken into continually ; finally , it was bombed beyond repair . But this has not ended the terror of the right . These young people are so threatened that they have to guard their home night and day . This type of violence is kept very quiet . This is an experience that blacks , whites , rich and poor young radicals know well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Mr. Howe replies : " Of course , as I wrote in my article , ' We have had plenty of terrorism in the United States , // Letters // mostly by far-right lunatics and racists ; lynching is an American contribution to the repertoire of death . ' And , of course , authority ? especially military authority ? is often oppressive . But none of these urgent truisms controverts , even touches upon , what I wrote about recent tendencies toward terrorism along a fringe of the New Left . It 's too simple to say that outcroppings of adventurism and authoritarianism in ' far left ' circles are the result of despair following upon defeats in trying to change this country . There is just too much evidence that , while despair is a major cause ( I said that , too ) , left authoritarianism has acquired a momentum and glamour of its own . " The main question is this : Granting shades of difference in analysis , what conclusion would Mrs. Simon draw that is in any way different from my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on  --  the left is politically suicidal and morally repugnant . " American liberals and radicals must make up their minds : Do we choose , with whatever difficulties , to remain committed to democratic methods , norms and institutions , or do we succumb to corrupt fantasies about ' revolutionary ' bank-burning and bomb-throwing ? " It 's like seeing a distraught man on a high ledge preparing to commit suicide . Whatever our notions about the ultimate causes driving him to such a step , our first obligation is to cry , ' Do n't jump ! ' In time , it may even become clear that this cry constitutes an act of moral solidarity . " ? To THE EDITOR : A few weeks ago at the State University of New York at Buffalo I encountered the hysteria so aptly described and analyzed by Irving Howe . To see the actions of those infected was upsetting , but not overwhelming : it was far more suffocating to feel the upsurge of pseudo-intellectual sympathy and to witness the frank unwillingness ? on the part of both faculty and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on the principle of human rights . Mr. Howe sees the problem of radical " tactics " in a context of rights . However , I would like to offer one friendly amendment to his argument . Terrorism is not wrong only because " minorities in a democratic society , as long as their right to dissent and protest is largely protected , do not have the right to impose their will upon the majority through violence or terror . " The violence and terror of the New Left is morally out of place whether performed by a minority or a majority , and whether directed against a majority or a minority . Also , it seems that the Morality of such methods is not dependent upon the type of society . Is it the principle of democracy  --  at least as it is commonly understood  --  that asserts the reality of human rights and the necessity for protecting them ? One might further question whether any group has the right to force its will on any other group by any means past a certain point . If this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus have not stopped intimidating those who displease them . NAME WITHHELD . Buffalo , N.Y . ? To THE EDITOR : Irving Howe rightly condemns the growing resort to violence by fragments of the so-called New Left . This tragic replay of follies committed in the name of " revolution " by earlier anarchists is certainly not going to hasten the long-needed socialist reconstruction of our society . Instead , it threatens to postpone it indefinitely by supplying an excuse for a fascist crackdown . To seek to effect social change through political terrorism and violence is , in the American context , mindless to the point of criminality . For despite some serious shortcomings , our political process still does offer potent means for peacefully pursuing fundamental changes in America 's institutions . As the most civilized aspiration in the history of mankind , socialism not only should but also must be striven for by civilized methods . Political action centered on orderly propaganda and purposeful use of the ballot is pre-eminently the civilized method called for . The Socialist Labor party 's program has been shaped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority for socialism at the polls . And , to insure that the mandate thus delivered is obeyed by the diehard capitalist minority , it provides for a nonviolent enforcing power : an industrial union of all the workers in the land  --  professional and supervisory , as well as rank and file  --  which will take democratic , social possession of the national economy when the majority 's vote has decreed that course . Such an industrial union will have a power that is irresistible , yet entirely peaceful and in harmony with the socialist goal . Because its revolutionary action is to be taken in fulfillment of the politically expressed wish of the majority , the Socialist Industrial Union will give police spies and agents provocateurs no field to operate in . Nor will it give the Agnews the slightest grounds for posing as social saviors . STEPHEN EMERY , Socialist Labor party candidate for Governor of New York . Jamaica , N. Y. POLLUTION DILUTION TO THE EDITOR : In " The Economics of Pollution " by Edwin L. Dale Jr . ( April 19 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws " influencing the reduction of pollution . I would argue , however , that Mr. Dale misdirected the attention of his readers by implying that if these laws could be changed , pollution could be stopped . In fact , the attack against pollution need not concern itself with these " iron laws " because the causes of pollution lie elsewhere , and to this extent Mr. Dale has created a straw man . The causes of pollution lie not in the accelerating growth of the world economy , but rather in the curious ways Americans and others have chosen to price our natural resources . Because we have historically assigned zero cost to air and water , our industries have understandably chosen to design production processes which utilize relatively large amounts of these " free " inputs . Because we have not assigned a cost to the use of the seas as dumping grounds , industries and individuals have logically used them to discharge their wastes , instead of disposing of these wastes in a more costly manner on land . Because we have not understood that the defilement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert test areas and offshore drilling sites is inherently costly to the environment , we have not charged for this privilege . If , on the other hand , the peoples of the world through their governments could and would assess a price for an act which results in pollution , the act of polluting would become unprofitable and would be stopped . Traditionally , governments have not assessed these costs nor assigned the prices that would inhibit the practice of polluting . Rather than blame economic growth for pollution and then cry because growth can not be stopped , let us look at the real causes of pollution and begin to restructure the prices we assign to our precious resources . JOHN E. GROMAN , Graduate School of Business Administration , Harvard University . Cambridge , Mass . ? To THE EDITOR : Edwin Dale 's article is a clear example of the kind of cultural self-hypnosis which must be overcome if the rising concern for environmental rescue is to have positive results . Dale 's presentation of economic growth as an " iron law " that we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only hope that economists do not share his view . Dale 's description of the economic causes of our plight is reasonable . To allow his readers the possibility of assuming they are helpless in the face of these laws is to issue a ringing call for inaction . What can not be changed is the way the physical and biological world works . Economics must conform to the world as it is , not the world // Berkeley ( Calif. ) street corner Should we charge for use of the air ? Letters // as some men would like it to be . This is the heart of the environmental crisis and is successfully avoided in Dale 's treatment . If he is correct in his analysis of what men will probably persist in attempting to do ( his " iron laws " ) , then we are , indeed , headed for Hades in a handbag . As an individual , it does n't concern me much that man may become extinct or reduced to a B.C. standard of living , but I would hope the events could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prediction that man will continue to promote a totally unrealistic economic system in the face of the " iron laws " of the environment . Dr. ROBERT M. CHUTE , Vice President , State Biologists Association . Naples , Me . ? To THE EDITOR : Edwin Dale makes some cogent points , but does not consider certain factors that would help relieve his pessimistic conclusions . As he points out , attempts to relieve pollution , such as the construction of sewage plants , must themselves create pollution because of their use of steel , electric power , etc . This shows that there is probably some minimum amount of environmental destruction required by a high level of productivity . However , that minimum might be considerably below the amount of blight we are living with now . That sewage plant , for example , will clean up water for many years and remove far more pollution than its construction and operation produces . Technology applied in a helter-skelter fashion is destroying the balance of nature , but rational application should yield improvements . Second , the article implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living are one and the same . A certain minimum of production is necessary for widespread comfort , but beyond that the connection is less direct . Our standard of living would not have to drop with a fall in production as long as the remaining production were more intelligently channeled . If , for example , half as many automobiles were made , but they were built to last twice as long as the present ones , the public would benefit from the decrease in junked autos and in the pollution associated with steel production , and our lands would not have to be ravaged so much to provide raw materials . The problem is how to shift priorities within a reasonable time without unduly harming workers who are tied to the present priorities . A society which has such a high total productivity will have to find some way to distribute its products to everybody without demanding socially unnecessary work from the recipients . CARL B.
