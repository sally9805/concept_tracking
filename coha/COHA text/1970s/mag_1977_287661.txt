It ranked among the least surprising social announcements of the year . In a terse , yet poignantly personal four-sentence message , Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau , 57 , and his aspiring-photographer wife Margaret , 28 , last week declared that they are formally separating . The statement issued by the Prime Minister 's Ottawa office said that " because of Margaret 's wishes " to " leave the marriage and pursue an independent career " the couple " will begin living separately and apart . " According to the announcement , " Pierre will have custody of their three children Justin , 5 , Alexandre , 3 , and Michel , 1 , giving Margaret generous access to them . " Whether divorce will follow is uncertain , since both are Roman Catholics ( Margaret by conversion ) . " Both pray , " the statement concluded , " that their separation will lead to a better relationship between themselves . " <P> Severe Stress .

Margaret , then 19 , was the beautiful , free-spirited daughter of a British Columbia industrialist and former Canadian Cabinet member , James Sinclair . Canadians learned of the couple 's ultra-private wedding ceremony in March 1971 , three years after Trudeau was elected Prime Minister for the first time ; the rejoicing was akin to that for a royal coronation .

" A year later , she declared : " I 'm not going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Nor was she . While Pierre stayed home in Ottawa with the children , Margaret celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary by partying it up in Toronto with one of her favorite rock bands , Britain 's raunchy Rolling Stones ( TIME , March 21 ) . The group 's lead guitarist , Keith Richard , had just been charged with possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking . Margaret subsequently flew off to Manhattan and launched a freelance photographic career . <P> Back in Ottawa , the Prime Minister stoutly defended his wife 's independent ways ; since then , however , the couple 's paths have barely crossed . One of Margaret 's confidants declared last April that the pair had quietly agreed to a trial separation , but it was never confirmed . When last week 's formal separation was announced , Margaret was back in Manhattan , refusing any comment .
