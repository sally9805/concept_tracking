Some of the most notorious Nazi war criminals have escaped justice because West German judges have permitted unconscionably long trial delays . That is the accusation made by Hermann Langbein , 60 , an Austrian Jew who survived Auschwitz and is now secretary of the International Concentration Camp Committee , which documents and tries to secure punishment for Nazi crimes . In the committee 's quarterly bulletin Langbein charges that West German judges have gone out of their way to accept defense excuses for postponement , often causing trials to be delayed for a decade or more . Items : <P> &gt; Horst Wagner , 66 , an SS member of the German Foreign Office , was allegedly responsible for transporting Jews from occupied countries outside the Third Reich to concentration camps . He was arrested in 1958 , but it took German prosecutors nine years to prepare the case for trial . The date was finally set for May 1968 , but since then Wagner , who is out on bail , has won one postponement after another by changing attorneys and claiming ill health . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-delayed trial was to begin . <P> &gt; Dr. Horst Schumann , 66 , a medical experimenter at Auschwitz , was extradited from Ghana in 1966 . His trial in 1970 was interrupted because he was suffering from high blood pressure . No new date has been set . <P> &gt; Dr. Werner Best , 68 , was accused of complicity in the murder of 8,723 Poles . The case against him , set for last February , was temporarily discontinued by a vacation-replacement court . Last August the case was dropped entirely because of Best 's " old age . " <P> &gt; Dr. Johannes Thmmler , 66 , Gestapo chief of Katowice and president of the infamous Auschwitz Summary Court , has never been brought to trial because West German prosecutors declared themselves unable to assemble sufficient material from Poland to present a case . A German journalist , however , recently traveled to Poland and gathered enough material on Thmmler to write a 1-hr. 40-min. television documentary about his alleged atrocities . <P> &gt; Dr. Georg Fleischmann , accused of directing the mass executions of Jews at Smolensk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July the public prosecutor 's office announced that a case against several of Fleischmann 's accomplices was finally ready for trial ; Fleischmann himself died of natural causes in 1970 . <P> Since the end of the war , West German courts have convicted 6,330 people of war crimes and extended the statute of limitations to provide time to bring others to justice . West German officials acknowledge that delays exist . They blame a shortage of court personnel and the fact that witnesses are frequently too old or nervous to testify reliably , making it necessary to round up corroborative testimony . If witnesses abroad are unable to travel to testify in Germany , a number of delicate international negotiations must be carried out before a German investigating judge can journey to , say , Poland or Israel and question witnesses there . Langbein suggests that there are also other factors at work . Says he : " An Austrian or German was much more likely , by inadvertence or bad luck , to become a jailer than to be inside a concentration camp . The public reaction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite naturally one of ' There but for the grace of God go I. ' "
