txt NEW YORK ? The 3d-grader spelled her name , Chantel Marie Rodriguez , and then threw her arms around her teacher . " Tell him my name means Sing-andBe-Happy , " she said . Chantel Marie goes to St. John Chusostom 's , a Catholic school in the garbage-littered , burned-out South Bronx , A message of hope for education in the poverty areas is coining from St. John Chrysostom 's and some 50 other church schools in Manhattan and the Bronx . Almost a decade ago these schools were doomed by a management advlsory committee that recommended that the Archdiocese of New York close its inner-city schools . The committee cited financial deficits and projections ' of a decline in the Catholic population . 0 INSTEAD , TERRENCE Cardinal Cooke kept the schools going with a re-. newed commitment , Wealthier suburbs were assessed . The proceeds , $21/2 million per year currently , were redistributed to poor parishes . A fund to help inner-city parents pay tuition was launched and has drawn contributions from Jews and Protestants and corporations as well as from individual Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0500 , Paradoxically , the once-doomed schools are bringing new life into the Catholic education system . SINCE 1070 , FEWER than a dozen inner-city church schools have folded in Manhattan and the Bronx . The more than 50 survivors have an identity all their own . The principals , who can hire nuns and teachers and select textbooks , have made them that way . Visiting one of the central Harlem schools , which has about two-thirds Protestant enrollment , ? Cardinal Cooke heard the kindergarten sing the alphabet song and told them he would teach them to spell something , It was n't a religious word . It was N-E-W Y-O-R-K , // Column 1 Church helps save inner city schools // which could have been a message to grumblers in the well fixed parishes . SET IN a predominantly Puerto Rican area , St. John Chrysostom 's has about 50 Protestants among its 500 Hispanic and 100 black students . In this world the kids are called " students . " " Pupil " has been dropped along with another robot word , " nun , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to move in joyful clusters , rather than silent straight lines , and their common trait is the broad smile . There is no fear of being hit . Corporal punishment has been outlawed in the New York archdiocese , and Sister Theresa O'Connell , the principal , says she would fire a teacher , lay or religious , for a slap . SISTER TERESA , who chooses not to wear a habit , moved into one room and demanded , " How many here have very neat notebooks ? " The response was about 35 smiles and about half that many hands . " How many have perfect one-half inch margins ? " The same number of smiles and a different scattering of hands . " You 'll have to admit they 're lovable , " the principal muttered . A 5th-grader , Velma Rios , read from the Bible . That and a prayerful exclamation by Sister Teresa , when the South Bronx 's arson plague was mentioned , were the only bits of religion heard at St. John Chrysostom 's , but Catholic administrators said all students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffed by 16 Dominican sisters and 7 lay teachers . The school has an influx of children whose main language is Spanish . Onesixth of its student body moves away each year . The home lives are subject to the inner city 's social troubles . Yet this school has only 50 to 75 students seriously below grade level in reading , and fewer in math , said Brother Joseph Shields , the young-Bronx superintendent who taught for five years at a black school in South Africa . In the East Village of Manhattan , Sister Elaine Owens guessed that 60 to 70 per cent of the families sending children to St. Brigid 's School are " maternal " ? headed by mother or grandmother . Children shuttle in and out of the small school . " ONE FAMILY has moved back to Puerto Rico four times . It 's very unfair to the kids , " said this principal , a member of the Sisters of Charity of New York . Sister Elaine has achieved renown in Catholic school circles by taking in public-school students who have been expelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge that Catholic schools dump their problems on the public schools . Reading is stressed at St. Brigid 's . Sister Elaine explained that each class is divided into three groups ? above , at , and below the reading norm , Is St. Brigid 's averaging at the norm ? " God , we better be , " she said . " We 're putting our life 's blood into it . If they start in the 1st grade , by the 7th they 've got It all together . Either they get it Together or they fall apart . " THE SISTERS in the deprived neighborhoods are volunteers because the liberalization of the religious orders has won for them the right to pick their teaching assignments . They report fondly that the inner-city children seem always to be touching the teacher 's hand or grabbing her sleeve . At the archdiocesan school headquarters , Sister Helen O'Neill , deputy superintendent , spoke of the less attractive side of inner city education . " It 's very dangerous , " she said bluntly . " People ca n't take these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason . They seem to be able to survive . At St. Athanasius two of our people were attacked , ' at one time , but they continued to live there . " The inner-city teachers are the heroes and heroines of today . Those in suburbia might be mad at me for saying that . " SHE SAID INNER-CITY teaching is " twice as hard " because so much has to be done in the classroom . She said many mothers have to work and their children have no one at home to help them or read to them . Sister Gloria Meola , principal of St. James School on the Lower East Side , said the classroom is the place for " learning resources . " " The normal child learns right in the class with the teacher , " she explained . She picked at random an achievement record from a stack on her desk . It showed that her 5th grade last year performed at or above national norms in reading , language arts , math , social studies , and science . THE LOWER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last century . Among the old structures still around , a few blocks from City Hall and the courthouses and the new police headquarters , is St. James , which was built in 1854 . St. James is one of the most cosmopolitan schools in the city . Sister Gloria said she has 20 black , 43 Asiatic , 138 Hispanic , and 42 white students , and only 30 or 40 are below grade in reading . She has no bilingual clasess , in reading . She has no bilingual classes , South America , helps the Puerto Ricans keep up on their Spanish grammar after school . The principal , a member of the Sisters of St. John the Baptist , also reported that the Hispanic children have learned Chinese jump-rope songs and the Chinese are singing Spanish jump-rope songs . A bronze plaque over the door of St. James reads : " Governor Alfred E. Smith attended this school . It was here he received his only formal education . "                 @ @ @ @
