THEY SAY HOME IS A PLACE where one is re .. membered . My brother Rolf , however , had again forgotten about our arrival in Frankfurt until I called him from an Autobahn rest house a few hours away . He is like that . A respectable hulk of a man , but most of it unadulterated inertia . In Germany his kind of repose strikes one as eccentric . To me it is the quintessence of his charm . He now inhabits our old apartment all by himself , though it was once big enough to hold seven of us . Not long after my father 's death in 1961 , our mother moved into a small bungalow in the country , where she could be alone and receive her grandchildren on weekends only . My three sisters had left one by one , after they married and proceeded to spawn their own broods . One of them moved as far away as Geneva , where she wed an Italian engineer . Only Rolf lacked the energy to quit the place . Three years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve unhappy months , his bride left and took a shiny tea table and the marital bed with her . It was as if the old flat had refused to serve as the shelter for another generation of Ungeheuers , a name that means " monsters " in German . He is only five years older than I , but belongs to that other generation which had their lives slashed by the war . Many of his friends died in it . And not the least talented . " The eager ones were always the first to get it , " he once told me . To survive you had to be a little lazy . They had drafted Rolf three times . First , at the age of fifteen , when they took all the able-bodied boys in his high-school class and trained them as Flak Helpers . They wereput into gun-gray uniforms with swastika armbands to distinguish them from regular soldiers , and taught how to handle the 88-millimeter antiaircraft pieces set up behind a brick factory a few miles from our house . As Flak Helpers they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Usually , they were too tired to listen to their lessons , having been up all night behind their guns , while the teachers slept in air-raid shelters . Two years later he was drafted a second time for his stint of A rbeitAdienst . This time they gave him a brown uniform with a swastika armband and a short-handled spade , whose blade had to glisten like a mirror for parades . By 1944 they had little time for parades , however . Most of the time was spent in the fields , digging tank traps and trenches . A lot of the boys came clown with pneumonia , but not my brother Rolf . They gave him a four-week rest after the A rbeitsdienst , before drafting him again . This time he came home wearing a green uniform with a small eagle on the arm holding a wreathed swastika in its claws and a black patch at the collar marked by the runic letters SS . For his basic training he was sent to Munich . Within a few weeks his sulky stubbornness had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the SS Kaserne , a group of desultory buildings enclosed by a high wall . On the back he wrote , " The SS stands for Sing-Sing : Rumor has it that the architect committed suicide after finishing the buildings . " They did not get him for that , however . The charges they brought against him were far more serious . He had disobeyed the order of a corporal , whom he then told that the war was as good as lost and Propaganda Chief Joseph GObbels was a blowhard . The corporal immediately denounced him to the company commander . He was spared a court ? martial because he had not yet sworn his oath to the Fuhrer and the flag . Instead , they decided to " break him " their way before sending him to the front . For a few days a drill sergeant chased him over the frozen barracks yard in full field pack , ordering him to take cover in shell craters filled with water . Every time he reached the edge of a crater ? the grounds were riddled with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolf dived into it . He told me afterwards that he considered himself lucky not to have been sent to the Russian front . Apparently , the trains had already stopped running to the East . Instead , he witnessed the last fighting around Bavaria , where the SS was almost as busy stringing up Wehrmacht stragglers as harassing the advancing U.S. Army . Several limes he was separated from his unit . Finally , he was rounded up with 200,000 others in a camp near Regensburg . Rolf learned how to survive in POW camp . He also began to appreciate his membership in the SS for the first time . ( He was always a late developer . ) What impressed him about his SS buddies was how they managed to stick together when others fell apart . Those who knew how to use their hands managed best . Mechanics , carpenters , plumbers , and electricians were the first to have access to work and food . They were the most needed . If he learned a craft after his return , he would always be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the dine I finished high school in Frankfurt , Rolf , who returned from POW camp in the summer of 1946 , had acquired the skills of a precision mechanic . For the next fifteen years he worked in an assembly line manufacturing typewriters and accounting machines . When he got tired of being an ordinary factory worker , he enrolled in a course for " masters of industry , " only to discover that the euphemistic diploma was worthless . The available foreman jobs in the plant went to the relatives of other foremen , most of them former Communists . ( The party was banned again despite the Allied victory over the National Socialists . ) They liked to remind their fellow workers over lunch that Uncle Joe was still alive and well in Moscow . As someone who was born into the white-collar Kleinbarger , the lower middle class , Rolf felt as isolated in this company as he would have among a new jeunesse doree , whose fathers had caught the right end of the first postwar boom . N MY RETURN TO FRANKFURT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment made it easier to feel at home again . It was a refreshing contrast to the conscious modernity we had encountered around every bend on the way in . The old linoleum floor mother used to keep at a high gloss was a relaxed , dull shade now . The little door to the overstuffed garbage bin would nolonger lock . The boiler over the bathtub leaked out of the wrong faucet . The apartment 's water closet broke down the day of our arrival . Next year they would install entirely new fixtures in the bath and kitchen , Rolf assured me . Rolf had laid on a small supply of Rhine wine . It was his only improvement over the old menage . He also had a bottle of Calvados and a freshly cured ham , which hung from the kitchen window . In the evening some of his friends dropped by to share the wine . He was a good host , who knew how to make people feel comfortable . The others were soon off on their new German superlatives . Frankfurt 's airport now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as London . The Nordweststadt was the biggest satellite town in Germany . Even Americans came to study it . Two-thirds of the people in Frankfurt worked in service industries ? the only German city to approach the U. S. average . They were building hi-fi speakers at Braun 's no bigger than a tennis ball , but with an inimitable purity of tone . The fabulous Wankel rotary engine ; a camera lens small enough to photograph nerve ends ; the best color television in the world . A new , new world in which everything that was would soon be replaced , " Deno alles was ensteht eerdient zu Grund zu gehn , " as Goethe 's Mephisto told Faust ( " For everything that grows deserves to perish " ) . But then Goethe had also come from Frankfurt . With an ironical smile , Rolf promised lo modernize his apartment , too , by separating the rooms with revolutionary walls of electric light It was curious . Why did he always seem to be so much out of step with his contemporaries ? I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleinbarger . " We bake the smaller bread , " he had once defined it and forbade me to speak High German to him , the accent affected by the educated class in our part of South Germany . He warned me that my origins , dialect , and lack of property would always condemn me to one class . " You just want to wee-wee with the big dogs , " he said , when I went off to learn how to ski , " hut you ca n't raise your hind leg that high . " During my senior year at Harvard I invited him to try his luck in the U. S. His visit turned out to be something of a misadventure all the way around . The Raytheon Company offered him a position in its new transistor department plus an opportunity to gain an engineering degree on the side . It seemed like an excellent opportunity to me . But he was already twenty-nine at the time and skeptical about his future , perhaps a little afraid of the new challenge . He pretended the U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of naked telephone poles on the streets of Cambridge . They hurt his eyes . " Why ca n't they put their power lines under the ground the way other people do ? " he said . The remark proved prophetic . I also introduced him to my friend , Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan , who was just back from a visit with his father . Rolf was not impressed . The only thing he liked about John D. Rockefeller IV , another member of my Harvard club , was the state of his footwear . He liked to see a man who could afford to hang an original Utrillo in his rooms wear torn , washed-out sneakers . But he did not neglect to warn me about these associations , of which I may have been unduly proud . They would get me nowhere , " except after you return everything will be much more painful . " He went back to the assembly line at the Remington Torpedo Works in Frankfurt . A her two more years he enrolled in a night school to become an electrical engineer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took a job with the Municipal Power Works , supervising the laying of electrical cables ? underground . The morning after my arrival he left for the Works at six-thirty . In Germany almost everybody starts work at seven . It is one of the secrets of the " economic miracle , " I believe , because it forces everyone into bed early , while it leaves a good part of the afternoon for family life . As soon as he was gone T rose , too . There was a place 1 had been eagerly waiting to see again . It is an old wooden bridge , and in my mind this bridge had come to stand for The Bridge , the one that should never be burned down . It was my link to home just as it had once been our link to the city . Also , I suppose it had something to do with the way our homes help to shape the anatomy of our imagination . My first Crayon drawing of a bridge in kindergarten resembled this bridge , and the river that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all rivers to me , the tall ash on its banks a little way downstream the criterion for trees . All the way back to Frankfurt . I had begun to think about this bridge again like a point of repair . It was winter now . The river looked dark and clean , its frozen banks were covered with snow . In my day ice would have hardened the surface already . We would have marked off a hockey field and been out there swatting away with our homemade sticks at a crunched tin can . I suspect the acidic wastes in the water from a chemical plant upstream was to blame for its refusal to freeze over . Within a few feet of the bridge they were finishing a span of superhighway to link the Nordweststadi to the city of Frankfurt . A lot of concrete had been expended on it . The fields in between , I had been told , would he spared , " to leave a green area between the inner and the outer city . " Arriving in Germany from France this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For hours I had been steering my car through an endless row of trees closing in on us from both sides . It was like running a gauntlet to reach the frontier at Saarbriicken . Then we suddenly passed into the twentieth century . The broad ribbon of the Autobahn wound away from the customs shed , curving around the first urban obstacle course . In a French town , we might have stopped for a bowl of soup or a quick look at an illuminated cathedral . ) The modernistic rest houses on the Autobahn stayed open all night . On the pay telephone you could dial any part of West Germany . The service at the pumps was rapid and friendly . All along the Autobahn trucks were out , their yellow warning lights flashing , spraying the snowy lanes with salt . In the driving snow other cars continued to pass us at near top speed , as if their drivers wanted to live up to the foreign caricature of the Germans as a reckless people hurtling toward a new doom . They have always been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The view one had from the old wooden bridge had also been modern not so very long ago . I could never conceal a certain amount of pride in having been born there . The fact that it was a low-cost housing project bothered me very little until I showed it to my wife . She found it all singularly drab . Nor could she share my nostalgic notions about its Roman past . The river was still called the Nidela , for instance , after the Roman town of Nida built there by Trajan in the first century A.D. arid surrounded by a ring wall in the third . When the housing project was built in 1927 , they had uncovered enough Roman relics to fill a museum and it was decided to call it the Rilmerstadi ( Roman Town ) . Along Ihe northern edge of the ROmerstadt ran an old road , etched deeply into its own bed , which was still known as Heerstrasse ? the Street of Armies . It too was said to date back to the Roman conquest in the first century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once dug up a coin bearing the head of Emperor Vespasian . As children , we appreciated especially the unsparing multitudes of other children in the 11.6inerstadt . Lawns embedded in concrete were still lawns to us . In the fields on the other side of the ring wall , farmers still grazed their cattle and sheep . During the summer we cut secret paths through the ripening rye and wheat , and in the fall we combed the brown earth for forgotten potatoes , roasting them in our own fires of dried weeds . Our parents never ceased to remind us how lucky we were not to live in the city itself . They had been quick to assume the suburbanite 's contempt for towns . N OR DID WE SUFFER ANY UNNECESSARY PANGS of class-consciousness . Most of our parents were poor , but their poverty was blunted by youth . The city chose to move young white-collar families into the Iiiimerstade They were all sales representatives for well-known Konzerne , it seemed , with names like Telefunken , Siemens , or fliichst , plus a sprinkling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own father , many of them had been out of work for more than a decade , and considered themselves fortunate if they managed to huld on to their jobs during the Thirties . Their organizations meant more than mere jobs to them . A Konzern was the protective bastion against the vicissitudes of having to live by your own wits . Just like the Army . I think they would have liked to wear the trademarks of their companies like regimental badges . " This was also the place where the swastika flag hung thickest from the windows , " our teacher once announced to the class , shortly after the war . I was only one of three boys in the class who lived in the Rilmerstadt and I felt ashamed . He was right . of course . On national holidays , especially on Hitler 's birthday , the fronts of our apartment blocks were festooned with flags . Whenever Hider gave a speech on the radio , you could listen to it . walking through the garden plots between the houses . Everyone turned up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Sondermeldungen ( special announcements about the Blitzkrieg in Poland that way , and a little later about the advance of the W ehrmacht into Belgium , Holland , and France . My father had tacked a map of Europe on our living-room wall on which we followed the progress of our troops with small red pins . He was a member of the National Socialist party , too , though lie was slightly less enthusiastic about the fabulous victories of the Wehrmacht than I was . " The Germans always win the first battles , " he said , remembering the four years he spent in the trenches after the initial successes of the first world war . Having , been horn in 1893 , he was the perfect age when the war began . Four years later he returned emaciated and fatigued , looking far older than his twenty-five years . The first year was spent looking for employment as an industrial draftsman , the job for which he had been trained before he was drafted . He lost it again during the great inflation of the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some parts . His talent at the piano saved him from the worst hardships during the next decade . He became an expert at accompanying the silent movies and something of a celebrity in beer gardens , where he provided the Stimniungsmusik on his accordion . Before Hitler , my father 's political affiliations had wavered between carrying handbills for the Communists and a brief acquaintance with members of the Nationalist Steel Helmet Association , most of them veterans of his World War I unit . The movement that managed to combine the frustrations of both , of course , was Adolf Hitler 's party . A description by the German journalist Paul Scheffer in the April 1932 issue of Foreign Aflairs gives an instant 2:linipse of a typical audience at Hitler 's rallies in hat period . " The predominant element in the hall is what is so aptly described in Germany as the declassed ' middle class : creatures visibly down at he heel , spiritually crushed in the struggle with veryday reality , distraught in the perpetual worq shout the indispensable necessaries of life . One totes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t is that famous ' brew ' into which Germany , once to stably articulated in her classes and callings , has dissolved during these past ten years . " My father 's luck did not change until 1935 , when re managed to land a job by joining the SA . They ' ound him a position as a designer in the Lurgi engineering branch of the Metallgesellschaft , a large tolding company with interests in nonferrous petals , chemistry , and mining , founded and still ) wned by one of Frankfurt 's powerful Jewish famiies . Though they remained in legal control until 1938 , the Mertons had lost their say over personnel ) olicies in the affiliates . Perhaps Herr Merton , vhom I later met at the home of the New York T HE END OF THE WAR CAME far less painfully than my parents had first imagined , since the ROmerstark never became a battleground and Frankfurt was only feebly defended . Until the end , my mother refused any defeatist talk . With the instinctive foresight of history 's victims , she prophesied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told us in the bomb cellar one night . " milk and honey will flaw in this land , because Germany will be the last frontier against Communism and the Soviet Union . They will have to feed us , because they are just as afraid of Germany going Communist as the Nazis were . " When U. S. artillery began to shell us from the other side of the Main river , my mother first wanted to flee . My baby sister was packed into her carriage with a few loaves of bread and a bit of sandwich spread . We were each given a blanket and our warmest clothes to wear . There was only my mother , my three little sisters , and L Father was already gone with the Volkssturm , where he had finally been reunited with some of his old SA cronies to organize a last-ditch defense . But he had made it back to the apartment before the Americans crossed the Main . Luckily , my mother too was struck by the ridiculousness of her own attempt to flee . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After we had walked only a few hundred yards behind the baby carriage , she wheeled it around and returned to the apartment . We spent the next few days in a concrete air-raid hunker in the neighborhood , waiting for the shelling to subside . For me and my friends the event was , of course , full of adventurous possibilities . the way much of the war had been . We climbed . I remember , to the tower of our grade-school building , which had recently served as the headquarters of the Flak Brigade . Now it was deserted . On the turret the Flak had left a pair of strong night glasses mounted on a metal bar through which we had a clear view of the town in the distance , the wooden bridge in the foreground , and the fields and patch of woods between us and the city . We were sure to get a sighting on the first American tanks when they emerged from the woods . In one of the rooms of the school we found large , yellow paper balloons which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired into an aperture on the bottom . They were carried aloft as suon as the burning wax filled them with hot air . We let several of them go from the turret and saw them float away toward town , with the unfortunate result , half an hour Inter , of heavier shelling from the other side of the Main . The first Americans we saw were black . They were seated in the cabs of two-ton trucks that , began to roll over the Hecrstrassc one morning . The day before I had seen the last SS men pass by on foot . A tall blond corporal , whom I handed a plate of mashed potatoes and two cigarettes , told a group of weeping women , " Do n't worry . We 'll be back . " Most of the women had sons on the Russian front , few of whom ever came hack . The next thing we knew American trucks were rolling along the ancient road that had carried so many armies through our province . It was an endless line of trucks , one behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For two days and two nights they filled the air with the deep growl of their engines . For my parents there were new fears . There was little food left in the stores , and when the bakery opened a few days later , long lines quickly formed outside . Polish laborers , who had broken out of their camp in a nearby factory , lost no time letting the local populace feel a bit of their pent-up anger . They marched up to stores in platoon strength and pummeled the women with clubs . Then they raided the shops . A week later the Americans installed a platoon of infantrymen near us , whose main task , it seemed , was to protect the women in the neighborhood against further attacks . A few apartment blocks were cleared of German families to give the liberated Poles some decent quarters . The American patrols in the Riimerstadt were soon surrounded by groups of boys ? the girls were still too shy ? who wanted to see their weapons , check their gear , and try out their rudimentary English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the boys on the block I had the most English available . My grades in school had always been below average . I suddenly had enough to suffice for the bare minimum of conversation . And converse I did . Within a short time , I was reading about the Katzenjammer Kids and Orphan Annie in the comic strips of a Miami Sunday paper , which one of the soldiers brought on patrol duty with him . Soon there were more Americans than we could handle . One Sunday morning in May , which had started out sunny and warm , American personnel carriers with mounted loudspeakers drove through the streets announcing that all families would have to clear out of their homes within three hours . No watches . Lugers , swastika flags , or past virtues . At my instigation Mother began to take in washing from soldiers , and I simply added some of my earnings to hers . Occasionally , I kept a bar of chocolate for myself and downed it amid waves of guilt . Soon I was better off than most Germans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in our apartment or in the same entry , began to bring back lunches from the mess hall for me . I could stuff myself on pineapple ice cream . Only a year later , when school started up again , I learned that many other Germans had made it a matter of pride to stay aloof from the U. S. Army . Meanwhile . I had seen many of my compatriots demean themselves for a few packages of cigarettes and had extended my lack of respect to all of them . " What people are ashamed of always makes a good story , " F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Last Tycoon . It was easy to despise the party officials who came to the fence to sell the insignias of their office . Shame began with the middle-aged women who prostituted themselves for less , and there were things that happened between my parents at home and to me outside that will never make a good story . On the other hand , it was normal that once the nonfraternization rules were dropped the Army 's contact should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always is . The whores , the fixers or " comrades , " as the GIs cynically called them , the black marketeers , and at most the poor , who permitted their daughters to be sexually exploited , were the only Germans most American soldiers ever encountered . No wonder that anyone seen in the company of a uniformed American or who had received American soldiers in his home could easily be ostracized as a Beutearnerilcaner ( booty American ) . I suppose I was lucky to run into Bob when I did . Whatever shame I might have felt over my previous associations with soldiers of the Riimerstadt garrison were dissipated by his singular friendship . His full name was Robert L. Cribbs , and he came from the small mining town of Florence , Colorado . He was the same age as my older brother , roughly nineteen , when we first met on the lawn between the fence and the mill in the early summer of 1946 . He was too young to have taken part in the shooting side of the war , and too eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be classified among the soldiers I had met before him . Also , he was kind . Our friendship was the result of a missing " t . " Another German boy , who was with him when I arrived , had written nut the German word for " pencil " on Bob 's note pad and spelled it Bleistif . With the arrogance of an orthographic genius I pointed out that it lacked a " t " at the end . Then I explained that in German we preferred to construct words out of components , rather than borrow from Latin . Blei stood for " lead " and Stift for " shaft . " In German a pencil was a leadshaft . We proceeded to more complicated constructions such as **29;2694;TOOLONG , which freely translated into " **29;2725;TOOLONG . " Bob humored my efforts the way he later humored any other foible heencountered among strangers . He was intolerant only to friends . He also quickly realized that although we were almost children still , our minds and attitudes had gone through an unusual , at times cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we joined at the age American boys went into the Cub Scouts . But that was where the parallel ended . The Jungvolk 's motto was " Swift as the windhounds , tough as pine-tanned leather , and hard as Krupp 's steel . " While Cub Scouts went on hikes , we went on marches . Where they camped , we held war games . While they were supervised by adults , Hitler 's idea was to " have youth educate youth . " Even political instruction was left in the hands of fourteen- and fifteen-year-old boys . They began by telling us that Jesus Christ was a Jew and Charles the Great , the first German Emperor , was far more concerned with uniting the German Reich than Christianizing the barbaric Saxons . Their . last heathen King , Widukind , was held up as the epitome of Germanic virtues , a kind of Teutonic " noble savage . " Toward the end of the war I was sent to an evacuation camp in Southern Poland , organized by the Hitler Youth . There we were even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where vestiges of the old teaching had still survived . On the night of the summer solstice our Hitler Youth leaders took us up to a summit of the Beskidy Mountains , near Krynica . We built huge fires , " like our Germanic forefathers . " As soon as the flames were low enough the braver boys jumped through the fire . Sitting around the glowing embers we sang and listened to our leaders ' heroic tales . They talked of the revolution that had brought the National Socialists to power in Germany , the street fights their fathers had waged against armed Communist bands , and how they rounded up the " Jewish swine " on November 8 , a new German day of Trinity , which now commemorated the 1918 armistice , the ill-fated march on the Feldherrnhalle in Munich , and Crystal Night . When the camp was moved to Moravia because of the advancing Russian Army , our special train was temporarily shunted onto a railroad siding near Oppeln in Silesia . On the track next to ours I saw a row of boxcars with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openings screened by barbed wire I recognized the gaunt , unshaven faces of men . Our leaders told us they were Hungarian Jews on their way to work camps . By that time we had been sufficiently convinced of the subhuman nature of Jews to ask no further . I do not believe I was any exception . Except that I will always remember that trainload of men . I do not know how much I told Bob about all this . We concentrated on the more innocent delights of the workshops he set up wherever he went , the certainties of science and the intricacies of our languages . Later . after he bad been transferred to a Constabulary Brigade in Darmstadt , about 35 miles south of Frankfurt , he often came to visit us in our small apartment . I learned to listen to the sound of engines in the street and could tell his jeep from all the others . When Bob could not come to Frankfurt , 1 hitchhiked to Darmstadt . His mother had sent out his old corduroys , a windbreaker jacket , sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I became the best-dressed boy in my neighborhood . In those togs hitching a ride on the Autobahn became a cinch . On a train trip from Frankfurt to Augsburg , I remember a conductor approached Bob for a cigarette and then asked for another . 1 was enraged when Bob also gave him the second one . " How else would he get a cigarette , " he explained , " except by asking for it ? If he asked for two , it means he wanted them badly enough . " He was a born master of the unstructured situation . Like the lime we were on a train to Nuremberg . We sat in a compartment reserved for U. S. military personnel . At the station in Hanau I heard screams from the car behind ours and saw a woman run onto the station platform with blood spilling from her face and neck . Bob jumped out of our compartment and climbed into the other one . He fell out seconds later holding a man by the scruff of his shirt . They hit the rails below with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had the right man , a young Pole , who had decided to make room for himself in the crowded compartment by the unconventional method of stabbing at anyone near him . I may be wrong , but I have always believed that Bob 's spontaneity was peculiarly American . Violence and compassion had always remained more visible in America , instead of being camouflaged and institutionalized , and public morality was still the product of self-help . T ILE ; BLISS OE MY NEXT AA1EEICAN ACQUAINTANCE was rather more mixed . This time it had to do with a girl . Her name was Yvonne , and she was the only daughter of an important member of the military government in Frankfurt . 1 ant sure that if I had not at least partially succeeded in turning myself into a carbon copy of an American seen-tiger , our acquaintance would have been brief indeed . The whole thing again started at the wooden bridge near home , where one day in the early spring of 1918 I ran into an American boy my age , who was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike . Like any German cyclist after the war , I always carried a supply of rubber patches , sandpaper , and glue in my saddle bags . He proved so grateful , after I had patched up his punctured inner tube on the spot , that he invited me to come along to his girlfriend 's house . I told neither of them that I was German until we had become friends . Yvonne was almost fourteen Inn already wore a bright lipstick , and she knew something about appealing to the man in a boy . Her father was a stern Texan of predominantly Irish descent . Her mother came from Central America , where her father had represented an American oil company before the war . I began to see her almost every day . In the summer we went horseback riding at an estate in the Taunus Mountains , driven there in her father'sstaff car and paying for the horses with coffee supplied by her mother . In the winter we skated on the ice-covered tennis courts of the Palm Gardens , a few blocks from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rink at Rockefeller Center . Needless to say , my life with Yvonne 's family had even less in common with the continued poverty and limitations of my own family than it had with Bob 's . With them I became conscious of a " social " distinction . It was not always easy to find the thread from my surroundings into a house - where meals were served by a domestic and the possession of a suit and tie would have been of an obvious advantage . But so long as our playtime was still limited to afternoons and weekends . it was rather simple . They lived only a short bike ride from home . We would just as likely do our homework together as play . That is. first I did my own homework and then hers . Her father was transferred to Wiesbaden a year later . There she enrolled in a regular U. S. Dependents ' High School . Fortunately , Wiesbaden was also only 25 miles from my side of Frankfurt , although getting there again meant hitchhiking under false pretenses . And worse , Yvonne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine Americans . She turned out to he no more eager to tell them the nationality of her weekend visitor from Frankfurt than I had been when we first met . We decided to give me another name , and I chose Criblas and altered my first name to Fred . I also claimed to be the son of an American public-opinion specialist assigned to the High Commission in Frankfurt . I could talk learnedly on that subject , since a year earlier , I had taken part in a poll on a " practical " assignment for the Economic High School I attended in Frankfurt . For a while no one noticed our ruse , though I lived in a constant panic of imminent discovery . During the week I was just another German schoolboy in Frankfurt . while on weekends I would don a pair of slightly threadbare Levi 's and my windbreaker and head for the Autobahn . Usually , I arrived just in time to take Yvonne to a movie with a group of other Dependents , most of them the offspring of Air Force generals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to records . dance the jitterbug , or neck on the couches . On Saturdays we always went bowling . Sometimes we or ganized a hayride when the weather was right . Tr my profound consternation these inevitably ender up in marshmallow fights . Once , I rose to my ful five feet , seven inches and shouted , " How dare yot throw food at each other , while people all aroum you eat their bread in tears . " The last line was fron Goethe . who had believed that " eating your brew in tears " was the essential ingredient of a trope sentimental education . But that was not my point As much as my double existence grated on me I could not let it go . Yvonne 's world was far mor delicious and carefree than the one from which came , where the constant worries over daily need overshadowed everything else . By running awa from it I felt like a traitor to my family . my schoo and my German friends . I might have continue 90 like that if a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come up to me one day and said , " I am told you are not really an American . And I want you to know that I do not want a German enjoying the same things I enjoy . " I was thunderstruck . I simply mumbled something about not having my AGO card on me and walked off . When I told Yvonne about it , she looked crestfallen . Her " reputation " was at stake , she said , The only thing I could think of doing was to go and look for my pal Frank Bernheisel . His name was almost as German as mine . He was the son of an Air Force meteorologist at whose home I had always been well received . He reacted just as I had expected he would . When I confessed my secret to him , he just said , ' ' It would be against my principles to change my mind about you because you are a German , " and swore " to get that little bastard 's goat " by " clueing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , except Joe , knew who I really was . A fcw offered to talk to their fathers to fix it up , but finally a suggestion from Frank carried the day . It was as simple as it was criminal . I was to get a false AGO card . Ile had lost his own once and found that the Provost Marshal 's Office in Wiesbaden never checked his ? identity when he filled out the renewal forms . I followed his detailed instructions down to making only a slight change in his serial number , when I applied for my card , to make certain it jibed with the original place of issue , which I had also copied from him . I topped the deception by having my photo taken in the Provost Marshal 's office over a name shield that said Fred Cribbs . They even fingerprinted me . A week later I was able to flash my card under Joe 's nose , while all the boys who had turned out to be my friends stood smirking on the sidelines . I could not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few days later I was forced to burn the card . I had committed the folly of telling Yvonne 's father about it . " You will get us both into jail , " he exploded , and carried the card to the furnace himself . Then , after a few weeks had gone by , he called me into his office in town and said , " Things arc getting too hot for you here . I have put your name down for a student-exchange program in the U. S. , where you will be able to cool your heels a bit . " He knew that he could not have given me a finer present . And so I went off to Pulaski High School in Milwaukee , did well enough ? better , in fact . than I should have ? then came home to graduate a second time from a Frankfurt high school . O N THIS VISIT TO FRANKFURT . I could not miss seeing old Buss ? Dr. Heinrich Buss ? my former English teacher again . It was almost twenty years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /eft for Harvard . At sixty-nine , he seemed as bright as he had been at fifty , his talk still a curious blend of conservative precepts and swaggering irreve ? ence . I had since encountered the mixture several times among middle-aged English diplomats , who had matured without undue recriminations about themselves . He readily admitted that his first postwar classes were closer to him today than any of the subsequent ones . Of course , we were not to be confused with the generation who had experienced the war as soldiers . Many of them had the last traces of spunk knocked out of them . If they returned , they began by spending their weekends in the cozy warmth of their beds and later contented themselves with the little pleasures of life : clean underwear , a decent meal on the table , a binge with friends now and then . There were many who never snapped out of it ? my brother , for one . But just as many became the big success stories of the first postwar genera . tion , men like Berthold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Germany 's largest mail-order house , Grundig in electronics . The organizational techniques that had produced a blitzkrieg also worked wonders in getting an economy off the ground again . " With you we were different , " Buss said . " We were tough and could afford to be . We tightened the reins , because the competition would not be easy later ? what with an influx oh eleven million refugees from the East . " But then had always been excitement in the classroom . " I was bristling with edginess and dissonance . Then were only one or two more classes like it . Then it go rather flat again . " There were ways in which we were not typical even of our generation . We were actually the firs rejects of the older , traditional process of selection Most of us had come to Frankfurt 's Economic High School because it represented the first alternativ. to get into a university . " Today , there are fifty four other ways of getting there . The old maxim have been voided without putting any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w had either been poor scholars in Greek . Latin , o algebra or in all three . For most the alternative ha . worked . They went on to get university diplomas A third had gone on to obtain a Ph.D . in eci nomics . Now approaching their forties , they vier all well established in business . The usual minorit had become genuine financial successes , and quit a few were absorbed by the overseas inve.stmer boom of the larger U. S. corporations . Those who worked for American eorporatior liked the personal freedom and far-ranging oppo unities an international company offered i employees . None seemed to be bothered by the chat vinist reticence I had frequently encountered i France , where the auxiliaries of the " imperiali expansion " of U. S. industry were less appreciate T asked Itudi Borgstedt. now a European marketir executive for Univac , whether he would not rath be working for a German company . After givit me a quick rundown on how and why the Germa : had missed the boat in computers . " although tl first one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added , " I would have nothing in princif against working for a German company , but I duo they would ever be able to give me the freedom action I now have . " 92 My generation had been happy to find its place in the modern organization and was glad to find it less parochial , less nationalist than in our fathers ' time . It had given them a degree of economic freedom and cosmopolitan sheen quite new to Germany , which , in the past , had struggled with everything except accumulated wealth . New military conquests , nationalist witch-hunts , or territorial expansion were unthinkable , far removed from the issues that occupied the minds of my old friends . Only one of my old acquaintances , a handsome young executive whose snappy manner and wit would have fit him for a Prussian guard regiment , regretted that " we no longer have anything like a fatherland to look back on with pride . " He had spent the last Bastille Day in a provincial French town , and " saw the local garrison promenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flutter of Tricolures . It all seemed so natural . For a moment I had an inkling what it meant to cultivate national traditions without inhibitions . " It was not necessary to search very far for these inhibitions . While I was in Germany , a group of generals , all of them graduates of the Prussian Staff College in the early war years , had just made a laughingstock out of themselves . They suggested reforms to improve the " fighting spirit " of the new Army by introducing uniforms " a soldier would be proud to wear off-duty , " basic training that paid less attention to " unnecessary medical safeguards , " and stiff reprisals against conscientious objectors , even if this involved constitutional amendments . The Bundeswehr , they concluded , could only be transformed into an effective instrument through a complete overhaul of German society , " from head to toe . " There was little doubt about what they meant by " head , " Rudolf Augstein , the editor and one of the wittiest commentators of the controversial newsmagazine Der Spiegel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his cabinet over the rabid generals he had inherited from the previous regime , admitted at a cabinet session that " much of what they proposed sounded like pure bunk . " Only people above fifty , who had lived through the spiked helmet and torch-marching varieties of German nationalism , seemed as worried about a aossible resurgence as some of the old , distinguished foreign observers . " It wo n't be the NDP in its present form , " Buss told me . " It will be cleansed of the least trace of the Nazi stigma but intransigently nationalist , nevertheless . " 1 brought the talk hack o this subject one evening , when a few of my former 7 , /assmates had gathered in Buss 's study . His observation was met by howls of laughter . Peter Kiich'er , wearing a regimental-looking rep tie over the Ind of tab collar they favored at Yale when William Buckley w as still an undergraduate there , halimpherl the loudest . Only moments before he had riven vent to his nostalgia about our loss of uniniihited cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Wolfgang Hits , Sec ? tary-General of the South German Publishers ' Issociation , said . " He has shot his bolt , and 1 do not hink we will hear much from him , anymore . " ATER , WHEN I WAS ALONE WITH RISS , I asked him a question which had been on my mind all evening . He was the only postwar teacher , I felt , who had put the accents right about what happened in and to Germany under Hitler . And I liked his frank irreverence . " We are a people of rootless ! I ausburschen , " he laughed , after I told him that one of his soils , who had visited me in Paris , vowed they would tackle the " new society " next in Germany . " It will be something worth watching , when we set out to reform a society again . " National Socialism , he still thought , had fit the German character like a glove . It gave free reign to our penchant for obedience , " die Wollust do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted him to tell me a little more about his own fate under Hitler . All I knew was that he had once been a member of the Catholic Zentrurn party in the Weimar Republic and after the war played a role in lay circles as head of a local Catholic welfare association . Perhaps he could give me a better answer than my parents had , who so easily succumbed to the National Socialists . After brief military service late in the war , he told me , he had served as a liaison man with the U. S. Army . " Not long after my return in 1946 I was denazified and began to teach school again , " he said . " But how could that be ? " I said . He was never a member of the party . " Yes , I was , " he said , and taking quick note of the startled expression on my face , added , " I had to take cover . My political affiliations before the take-over were too well known . It was easier for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not easy for any teacher to remain aloof from the party . " " When did you join ? " " In 1937 , " lie said . There were analysts who said it was worse to join in 1937 than 1933 , or before , when the real intentions of the party were not yet fully revealed . Paul Scheffer had written in 1932 : " ... the Hitler movement has not yet assumed its rational physiognomy . The currents of feeling which it expresses lie deep down in German life . They have still to come to practical expression . " But by 1937 the " practical expression " the party had imposed on a previously inarticulate majority should have left little doubt as to where it was headed . " A prominent National Socialist here , " Buss told me , " who knew the inner workings of the party far better than I did , told me at the time that it was not yet certain whether the rational or irrational , the bourgeois or populist tendencies , would win out . There was still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to drive any further into his ambiguities . His defenselessness had the feel of a limp handshake . I merely added , " But how could a man like you , with your background , your sense of right and wrong , live through those years when Germans were busy setting new criteria for cruelty ? " " I was a coward , " he replied , " and I knew that one day I would be condemned by my own children for this cowardice without being able to explain . " In 1938 , from the windows of his school , he had watched the first Jews arrive at a collection center in the Mauerweg . " All we could do was gnash our teeth and make the proverbial fists in our pockets . I know it sounds cheap . You do not realize how impotent we were . There was no one to talk with . Our ranks were riddled by quislings . I wanted to emigrate to England . But it is not easy to become a martyr . Believe me . Most of them became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough . " He appeared to be asking no pardon from me , only comprehension . Aware of the lapses in his own conduct , I was suddenly reminded of his emphasis on " good conduct " in his lectures to us after the war . Was that why English classes with him had usually turned into a lesson in manners with examples of " decency " and things that " were not done , " while even today he had still talked of the importance of " unrewarded service to others . " It all began to appear in a new light . Suddenly his convictions bore the stamp of personal failure . I asked him about what had happened to Frankfurt 's Jewish community . His account was extremely well documented . There were published volumes of personal accounts from Jewish burghers. including a few who had returned from concentration camps to tell their story . But the 50,000 people , a tenth of the former population of Frankfurt , who gave it the reputation of " the Jew town " under Hitler , had never come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lived in Frankfurt before , was around 3.200 . The community had half a dozen small synagogues and a grammar school of its own , the only one of its kind in Germany , in which all but one teacher was not Jewish . Buss pulled out a statistical yearbook of Frankfurt and discovered to his surprise that the Frankfurters had become shy of mentioning Jews under " religious of illation . " They were now classified among " others . " The next day . I called on Benno Reifenberg , one of the former executive editors of the Frankfurter Zeitung , who was responsible for its political section until Hitler personally ordered the paper shut down in September of 1943 . It had once been one of the best in Europe , vying with such liberal publications as the Neue 7iiricher Zeitung in Switzerland , the Parisian Le Temps , and the Times . Founded by Leopold Sonnemann , it had always counted a certain number of Jewish editors and correspondents among its staff . Most of these had been forced out by 1934 , only a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anticipated the racial laws of 1935 and 1938 . F I WERE LOOKING FOR TRACES of the Jewish Frankfurt , however , the one that helped create the Frankfurter Zeitung , Reifenberg could tell me only that " Frankfurt is gone , irretrievably lost . " He was one of the few , perhaps the only man , who genuinely seemed to miss the Jewish leaven that had once given rise to Germany 's intellectual life and a cos-mopolitan finesse to Frankfurt 's society . Talking JULY 1970 about himself , he momentarily lapsed into the old racial category of " half-Jew , " as he wondered about how he and one other editor , as well as two mer with Jewish wives , had survived with only minor molestations . Reifenberg was arrested " only once . ' The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he helped t ( found after the war has tried to revive the spiri of the old paper . But it still remains in the shadov of its famous predecessor . In a postwar review o the FZ 's previous failures at convincing Cermar governments of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National Socialism Reifenberg struck a note which I discovered all to , rarely elsewhere . He wrote : " It was obvious the through the rise of National Socialism the Ger ? &; nation was not confronted with a question of poll tics but a moral decision . " The criminal characte of the Hitler movement had long been evident , slated . In contrast to this statement , I found that to many people in Germany still viewed what ha ' pened as a political disaster on a par with a natuv calamity , and just as arbitrary . After I had raised the subject , Reifenberg begge me not to write about the fate of the Jews in Franl furt . " We can not build on that , " he said . No wort would do , " only acts , perhaps . " But how could avoid the subject , I asked . " No , you can not , " I answered finally . " The Jews were too much a part it . " The old man began to tremble slightly . I our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to st this old man 's memories ? I said something abor the shadows of the past of which everyone no seemed to be oblivious , and he turned to " Young man , when you mention shadows they b gin to loom and tower one upon the other . Wir sit emu so verschintpfiertes Volk. ( a people abandoned I luck ) . " He sat there in his small study , betwe . Russian ikons and a reproduction of the Van Go ; landscape he had once defended against charges " entartete 1 ( 111151 " in an old house he had neglect to buy when the buying was easy , with not mu more to pass on to his son than a freedom from t worst shame . ( His son , Jan , now FAZ correspond ( in Paris , formerly in Washington , continues to wo in the spirit of his father . ) The pain of his me ones was incommunicable .

No , more drawn than pushed had followed the invaders and gained an immei freedom . I had learned to move freely in anotl society .

It had never failed The fact that I was born in Frankfurt had come as incidental as my middle name . It wa. good place to be from , as they say . They could ahead and tear down that old wooden bridge re It had given me some good memories before it came the link to something far bigger than the ( on the other side of the " green space .
