Ostensibly , the hearings before Senator Gaylord Nelson 's monopoly subcommittee in Washington last week did not constitute a trial , either of the Pill or of its proponents . The Wisconsin Democrat repeatedly expressed his resentment of any suggestion that they were so intended . But the atmosphere in the hearing room was tense with ill-concealed hostility between the Pill 's attackers and its defenders . The give-and-take between Senators and witnesses , and even between Senators , had the tone of courtroom adversary procedure . The reason was clear : no new medical evidence had been presented in Nelson 's first hearings ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) , but wide publicity and scare headlines given to one side of the argument had created what some witnesses called a public panic . <P> Dr. Alan F. Guttmacher , president of Planned Parenthood-World Population and elder statesman of the birth-control movement , tried to turn the tables with a medical metaphor . " There have been undesirable side effects from these hearings , " he said . " They have created a sense of great alarm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American women who had been using the Pill had abruptly abandoned it , while as many more were thinking of doing so . <P> " I do n't think anyone is saying that your hearings are impregnating women , " Guttmacher told Nelson , " but the adverse publicity has caused many women to quit the Pill . " Kansas Republican Robert J. Dole interrupted to voice the hope that the resulting babies will not all be named for subcommittee members . But Guttmacher , like a committee of 19 Planned Parenthood physicians that met recently , had a more serious concern . By no means all the unwanted pregnancies will result in babies . As many or more will result in abortions ( see following story ) , most of them illegal , with the attendant hazard of serious illness or death . <P> Pregnant Brides . Guttmacher insisted that his intention was not to whitewash the Pill but " to place this matter in proper perspective . " The Pill , he declared , is " a prophylaxis against one of the gravest sociomedical illnesses-unwanted pregnancy . " Experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortions are performed in the U.S. each year , with a death rate of 100 per 100,000 illegal abortions performed by non-medical operators . At least one out of six U.S. brides is pregnant when married , and among teen-age brides , one out of two . No fewer than 300,000 illegitimate births are predicted for 1970 . At least 750,000 children born each year are unwanted .
