Still months from post time , the 1972 Democratic presidential sweepstakes have already recorded a scratch , Iowa Senator Harold Hughes , and an unexpected dark-horse entry , Oklahoma Senator Fred Harris . Assessing his chances recently , Harris noted that he must do well in the early primaries , then " get close to the top two in the polls . " The top two by then ? Ed Muskie , of course . And ? " Scoop Jackson . " <P> When Senator Henry Martin Jackson , 59 , began to toy with the idea of a candidacy last spring , he was rated as having little better than an outside chance for the vice-presidential nomination , and virtually none for No. 1 . Since then , the Washington Democrat has moved up remarkably fast . There are still few shrewd politicians of either party who see Jackson as the 1972 Democratic nominee ; he is barely visible in the national polls , registering only 1% or 2% . <P> Square Position . Among ranking G.O.P. officials , Jackson was recently rated the Democrat Richard Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll of Democratic leaders , he comes in a surprising second to Muskie , and leads Hubert Humphrey , Teddy Kennedy and George McGovern . Says another Democratic hopeful , Indiana 's Birch Bayh : " There is a lot of support around the country for Scoop . " When Hughes bowed out , he confessed : " I did n't take Jackson seriously , but I take him very seriously now . " <P> Jackson 's surge is in large part a measure of his unique position in the crowded field of aspirants . In contrast to his opposition , he has positioned himself squarely with the military-industrial establishment and big Pentagon budgets , thus cornering several limited but loyal bases of support and money . In recent weeks , he has tempered his pro-war views ; he now favors a gradual withdrawal . He supports the President 's proposed trip to China . Jackson also claims to have the most liberal voting record on civil rights and domestic issues of any prospective candidate . The Americans for Democratic Action , however , disagree ; the organization ranks him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Senate votes . <P> Anathema . Besides becoming known as the " different " candidate , Jackson plans to overcome his lack of recognition by winning an important primary , and he has chosen Florida as the site of the test . The Florida primary comes only a week after New Hampshire 's , so it has high-and early - visibility . It may also prove an excellent sounding board for the Jackson thesis that the economy , not the war , will be the major issue of the presidential campaign . Florida ranks high in Social Security recipients , and unemployment is substantial at Cape Kennedy . Jackson believes , with good reason , that his advocacy of price and wage controls , plus his support of the aerospace industry and his pro-labor voting record , will give him an advantage . Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff contends that if the voting were held today , " Scoop would win the Florida primary . "
