txt CECIL SAXBY retired last year at the age of 99 , as detective chief superintendent , Homicide Division , of London 's Scotland Yard , after 30 years as a policeman . He now is working in the United States as chief security consultant for a firm of property developers . He was in Chicago recently to supervise the moving of more than $1 million worth of merchandise from the Dunhill of London store on N. Michigan Avenue , to its new location in Water Tower Place . Figures for 1975 show that Britain , excluding Northern Ireland , with an approximate population of 50 million , had 451 murders . The United States , population approximately 220 million , had 20,600 , and Chicago , population approximately 3.2 million , had 818 murders . The following is an edited transcript of an interview with Saxby about why there are fewer homicides in Britain : Q ? What is the basic ' difference between the British and American police approach to crime prevention ? A ? The handgun . It is the Me , rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost unheard of in Britain . For instance , in a bar fight or . a domestic argument , it has been my experience that people rarely mean to kill , but in America they know there is a good chance the other chap will have a gun or a knife , so they have one , too , and it is that spur-of-the-moment action that kills . Q ? How are the guns kept off the streets in Britain ? A ? It 's virtually impossible to buy a handgun in Britain . To own any gun you have to be licensed by the police , and any previous criminal record rules you out . Q ? But what about the police , do n't they have pus ? A ? British police do n't carry guns . If there is a reason to have one , for instance a sniper , or hostages being held by armed people , then the police assigned to the case sign out a gun from a central police armory . But at the end of the day the weapons are signed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Q ? You were in homicide , the most violent of criminal activities . Surely you carried a gun ? A ? I carried a gun only 10 times over a 30-year period , and never once used it . Q ? Americans will find that very hard to understand . How can you go out on the streets unarmed looking for killers ? A ? As I said , it 's nearly impossible to get a gun on the streets , so there 's a better than even chance the murder weapon is not a firearm , so why should I need a gun ? Q ? Ilow do the British courts deal with people who do carry guns ? A ? Very severely . The worst thieves know that if they use a gun in a crime , or even carry one with intent , then everyone is looking for them , including some of their own kind . The " peaceful " robbers do n't ' want the police on their necks because of what some lunatic does . When the gunmen are caught they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's obvious that if someone is carrying a handgun , he intends to use it . Q ? Well , what does the British ' bobby ' carry for protection ? A ? A 10-inch long truncheon , and if he hits someone with it , it is immediately turned over to the police laboratory to be examined for blood traces . He has to have a very good reason for hitting someone over the head . A blow on the shoulder is usually good enough , it will paralyze the arm for a little while . Q ? Americans hear a lot about Scotland Yard . What is it ? A ? I suppose it 's the closest thing we have to the Federal Bureau of Investigation . There is no federal or national police force in Britain ; each area has its own force . The Yard is the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police , and the national criminal records headquarters . It 's true , I think , that the best of detectives will end up at the Yard . If there is a particularly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in because it has the best resources , including immediate communications with organizations like Interpol Q ? That 's another one . Mat is Interpol ? A ? It 's , not what it used to be , with police from all over the world running around Paris . Now it 's mostly a huge computer bank where international information can be cross-checked , and movements of known criminals can bo plotted . , Q ? When American policemen visit London as part of their job are they allowed to carry their guns ? A ? No . Why would they need their guns in London ? Q ? Organized crime  --  the Mafia  --  never really took a hold in Britain . Why is that ? A ? A number of reasons . Immigrants who came to Britain at the turn of the century were quickly integrated . There was never any reason for ethnic ghettos . Also the place is so sins% that 's what makes the image of the British " bobby ' so effective . It 's a grapevine . In London we know within hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easy to get last . Anyway , you ca n't have Mafia-types descending on an English country village . The local policeman would soon want to know who the strangers were . Q ? Britain has a reputation for having a " clean " police force . What about corruption . Does it exist to any great degree ? A ? No , and the main reason is ' , there are no political appointments . The police answer only to the Home Secretary ( an elected member of the British- government responsible for the domestic workings of the country not to a mayor or police chief . But who knows where corruption starts ? Is it a free drink , ? lunch , dinner ? That 's about the extent ' of it , although there are isolated serious cos . Cs . Q ? You 've painted a rosy picture of a vlolence-free country , but what about the IRA bombings that hit London in the last couple of years ? ? A ? It 's a political situation that the police can do little about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fight it . But the public is willing to help . It was a time of adversity . that affected the whole country and everyone rallied , You see , it comes back again to the gun . If a policeman in Britain is in trouble on the street , any number of people will go to his aid because they know they are not likely to get shot or knifed . It 's not the same here , and I ca n't blame people for not wanting to get killed . ' Q ? Do you think then the American policeman Is very much on his own ? A ? I 'm sure there are some cases when he will get help , but when he walks out on the street he must be happy knowing he has a gun on his hip . Q ? Would you bg a policeman in a place like Chicago ? A ? Certainly not . Chicago policemen handle a rough situation very well , and have a far tougher job than their British counterparts .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
