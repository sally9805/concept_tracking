It was a singular gesture for a profession whose lubricant , next to money , is tact ; but in Manhattan last week , the Art Dealers ' Association of America , representing the 86 leading art merchants in the country , loosed a statement denouncing the world 's most powerful museum , the Metropolitan , and its director Thomas Hoving . " The sale by museums of important works in their collections , " said the A.D.A. , was " in the nature of a breach of a public trust . " <P> For decades the Met has been selling-or , in the museum 's oblique officialese , " de-accessioning " - works of art to raise money for other purchases . This is common and legal museum practice in the U.S. , though not in England or Europe . But what provoked the A.D.A . was the discovery , reported by John Canaday in the New York Times , that last May the Metropolitan had secretly sold two paintings to the Liechtenstein branch of a leading international dealer , Marlborough Fine Art . The pictures were Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gogh . Last week the Met disclosed that two more of its paintings , a Modigliani and a Juan Gris , had also been traded to Marlborough for two unnamed works of art . Though the Metropolitan refuses to confirm or deny it , it is an open secret in the art world that these are a painting by Clyfford Still and a sculpture by David Smith , both of whom are represented by Marlborough . <P> The A.D.A . ' s chief objection was to the secrecy of the Rousseau-Van Gogh sale . Its statement urged that , when a museum sells a work , other American museums should have " ample opportunity " to buy it , and that if they do not , the work should be " offered widely in the market so that the maximum proceeds are assured to the selling institution . " Neither of these conditions was met by the sale to Marlborough , the dealers insist . Finally , said the A.D.A. , " if a museum does not subscribe to the foregoing principles and offers works ... privately or secretly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last clause was soothing to Marlborough ( whose client for the Rousseau , Italian Industrialist Gianni Agnelli , instantly cancelled the deal when the story broke ) , it was balm to Hoving , who derides the A.D.A . statement as " an absurd document-perfectly specious and contradictory . " The Rousseau , he adds , " was of no importance to us " ( although the Met owns only one other ) . This is not a view shared by most art experts or by Marlborough 's senior partner , Frank Lloyd , who says , " In my opinion , it 's a masterwork . " Hoving defends the disputed sale in terms of the need to trim redundancies from the collection . <P> " For the first time in history , we know what form the Met 's building will take forever . We can count every cubic foot of space we 'll have . So now our policy is refinement rather than expansion . We 're trying for zero population growth , weeding out and stabilizing the collection . Our criteria for de-accessioning are much stricter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
