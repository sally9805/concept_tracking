For twelve years , Fidel Castro 's Cuba has been out in the cold-banished from the councils of its hemispheric neighbors in the Organization of American States , and the victim of a formal diplomatic and economic embargo imposed by the U.S. and the rest of Latin America . Or so it has been in theory . In practice , ten countries , including Venezuela , Colombia and Argentina , have resumed diplomatic relations with the Western Hemisphere 's only Communist government . Despite the embargo , trade between Cuba and OAS nations is growing rapidly , and a number of foreign subsidiaries of American firms participated in a Mexican-sponsored trade fair in Havana in March . As one Mexican foreign officer put it last week : " The return of Cuba from years of isolation is a , fait accompli . " <P> Not quite . Washington is not yet prepared to lift the embargo , although pressures have been mounting within both the State Department and Congress for normalizing American-Cuban relations . Last week Senator George McGovern , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Democratic presidential nominee was the third Senator to make a factfinding visit to Cuba in the past eight months. * He went , as he put it , " to see for myself what the Cubans have accomplished in their system . I 'm going to try to learn . I want to see what they 're doing in health , education and agriculture . I want to see what they 're doing in the political field . " <P> McGovern 's timing was apt . It came right before the opening of the OAS foreign ministers ' meeting in Washington last week . The Cuba issue was not on the group 's formal agenda , but Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said he thinks that the OAS has reached a " general understanding " on a formula for ending the trade and diplomatic embargo . At the same time , two congressional subcommittees opened joint hearings aimed at proposing new legislation that could lift the economic embargo . <P> Popular Refrain . Castro has clearly indicated his willingness to make concessions in order to improve relations with the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provided for the prosecution or extradition of hijackers , which virtually eliminated a wave of hijackings to Cuba . In recent months , he has also acted to restore free elections and a measure of democratic rule to Cuba . Castro 's failure to hold free elections had become a major preoccupation of Cuba 's 9 million people , as well as a popular refrain among foreign critics of the Cuban revolution . Last week Granma , the official Communist Party organ , published a draft of a proposed new constitution , which provides for an elected National Assembly ; it is expected to be submitted to a public referendum later this year .
