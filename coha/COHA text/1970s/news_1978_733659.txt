txt Lusaka , Zambia Carrying radios , cameras , and clothes , looted during their nine-day occupation of the mining town of Kolwezi , hundreds of Zairian rebels are crossing the northwestern tip of Zambia on their way back to bases in Angola . The rebels , most of them traveling in trucks and cars stolen during their foray into Zaire , are retreating to avoid a possible attack by French paratroopers now in control of Kolwezi . There were reports that the rebels had abducted a number of white hostages from Kolwezi , although none were actually seen with the forces retreating over the border into Zambia . The rebels are traveling by night through Zaire to avoid being spotted from the air , but once inside Zambia they appear bold enough to walk about in broad daylight . A group of them came across the border into Zambia near the small town of Ikelenge , about 20 miles from Angola . They carried automatic weapons of different makes and wore sweat-and dust-caked camouflage uniforms in addition to civilian clothes . The platoon commander wore a neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to have acquired in Kolwezi , while an automatic weapon hung incongruously at his side // From page 1 Retreating Zairian rebels claim they have hostages Questioned through a Lunda-speaking interpreter , the commander said his platoon had been in Kolwezi until the French paratroopers were dropped over the town on May 19 . He said he had not witnessed the killing of any Europeans , but admitted that rebels had taken a large number of white hostages . He said the hostages were with another group of rebels mov ing farther north toward the Angolan border . The teen-agers in his platoon had cameras slung around their necks and begged newsmen for film . But they turned and walked away down the dusty road as soon as an attempt was made to film them . British missionaries living in the area say they counted ' more than 70 vehicles in a single column on May 23 and that the rebels were still crossing into Zambia from Zaire . One rebel truck was seen crossing into Zambia from Angola carrying fuel for vehicles which had run out , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry up . Like the villagers in northwestern Zambia , most of the rebels are Lunda tribesmen , and it is easy for them to mix with the locals . Many appear to be resting up with their kinsmen at Zambian villages , and the appearance of radios and smart new clothes at a number of villages seems to indicate that the rebels are trading their loot for food and shelter . Villagers are coming out onto the road to cheer the passing rebels . There is no doubt that they support the rebel cause . When one Land-Rover truck stopped at Ikelenge , dozens of wildly excited Africans crowded around it , cheering the armed soldiers inside . There are few Zambian troops in the area , and local officials are both powerless and unwilling to stop the rebels . The few policemen in the area have only bicycles for transport . They seem unconcerned about the influx of rebels . The rebels are believed to have passed through the same area to attack Kolwezi . Missionaries remember seeing hundreds of small cooking fires along the road a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening , " mission school headmaster David Foster said . " But the locals would n't say anything . They must have known but had been pledged to secrecy by the rebels . " Following last year 's invasion of Shaba Province , fleeing rebels were bombed and strafed by Mirage fighter planes of the Zairian Air Force . A Zambian mission hospital was hit . A Mirage fighter circled the same mission hospital May 23 but did not drop any bombs . A number of missionaries are in the area . None seems too concerned about the situation . One said the rebels had told them they would not harm anyone in Zambia . Most of the missionaries , however , have made plans to escape , should the need arise . Food and other supplies have been hidden in the bush . There are secret rendezvous points . British and American consular officials flew to the area on May 24 , but there were no plans to evacuate the missionaries. . ' . . ;              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
