WE 'RE ON THE treeshaded campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , sports fans , where more than 1,000 people have gathered for Origins I , the first national war-game convention . Hunched over their boards , they 're refighting all the great battles of yesteryear El Alamein , Stalin-grad , Gallipoli , the Marne , Sedan , Chancellorsville , Austerlitz . At one table a latter-day Napoleon has rallied the Old Guard and smashed the British square , sending Wellington reeling back to Brussels and changing the course of European history . Nearby , disregarding Hitler 's orders , Von Paulus and his Sixth Army break through the encircling Russians , stabilizing the Wehrmacht 's southern front . It 's funny and harmless , but the slightest bit unsettling , right on top of Vietnam . Who would be amusing himself in this way , vicariously sending thousands to death and dam-nation ? The question answers itself , right ? Military kooks , retired generals , professional drinkers of young blood , members of secret paramilitary organizations , Birchers preparing for the last battle with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short haircut , a clenched jaw , or a brass button to be seen . Just about everyone is under thirty . Most are in their early twenties . Many are as young as fifteen . Even by the relaxed standards of their generation they are sloppy dressers . Jeans and T-shirts sag on pale , unmuscled bodies . Long , lank hair , beards , bitten fingernails , acne , abstracted expressions . Brains , grinds , oddballs . The tone of the convention is n't just nonmilitary , it 's entirely anti-military . I did n't find a single player who had been in uniform . Most of them were dedicated pacifists . " I play because it 's fun , " said Stuart King . He is fifteen years old , has come from Eugene , Oregon . " You 're training your mind , learning how to think logically , getting into psychology . " His companion , Mark Edwards from New York , agreed . " You 're learning something instead of racing around some idiotic track , " he said . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing how many times your units get wiped out . Gen. George Meade was my great-greatTom Buckley is a New York City-based reporter for the New York Times . great-uncle , " he added . " When I play Gettysburg I have some idea of what he must have been feeling there . " Sitting on the sidelines , watching his young son play Von Richthofen 's War in competition with fifty others , Chuck Barrett , a sales engineer from Pittsburgh , said , " The reading and study behind this is really fantastic . Joe plays by mail all over the country . " Barrett , who spent four years in the Air Force during the early 1950s , figured to be the sort of father who would insist that his son go in for body-building and the Little League . Instead he seemed genuinely proud as he pointed over to the thin , bespectacled boy studying a board representing the sky over Flanders in the spring of 1918 . The players were divided into British and German teams , three on a side . Von Richthofen 's War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know something about air-combat tactics . They have to take into account the speed , rate of climb , fuel capacity , and armaments of the opposing planes , the famous Sop-with Camel and the Fokker DR-1 triplane . The umpire for the game was RanCLEAN CARNAGE dy Reed . He is the chief designer for the Avalon Hill Game Company of Baltimore , the sponsor of the convention and one of the two firms ? the other is Simulations Publications , Inc. , of New York ? that dominate the war-game subsector of the military-industrial complex . Reed , who is twenty-six , told me that he had been playing and devising war games for almost twenty years . He was , typically , a conscientious objector during the Vietnam war . He told me , " There 's a great sense of camaraderie among war-garners . They get very involved , very competitive , when they play , but I 'll be surprised if there 's a single angry word spoken in this room . A lot of war-garners are frustrated because they do n't have anyone to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school who 's interested . It 's too demanding to ever be widely popular . So they have to play both sides of a game , like solitaire , or they play by mail . That 's why you have so many turning out for this convention . " " Can you retreat off the board if you 're pursued ? " a player asked Heed . " No , there 's no escape , " he replied genially . " You 're in there to kill or be killed . Do n't forget that . " C HESS WAS ALMOST certainly the first war game . One theory is that in ancient India , where the game was devised , the pieces represented a king , a general , rather than a queen , war elephants , chariots , cavalry , and foot soldiers . Even today in Russia officers are encouraged to play chess to exercise their ability to plan ahead and improvise , but the game has never been particularly popular among American officers . They tend to prefer the rapid cut and thrust of bridge and poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem . After all , it was poker that provided John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern with the inspiration for their famous game theory , which has become highly influential in strategic thinking . Only in the past 200 years or so have war games with formal and somewhat standardized rules emerged . The first of these games as far as anyone can tell , was devised by a member of the staff of the Duke of Brunswick , a field marshal of the Prussian Army . This Kriegspiel was played on a board of 1,666 squares . Each side had 120 units of infantry , cavalry , and artillery , as well as supply and engineering auxiliaries , and a fortress . Capturing the enemy 's fortress was the objective . The game took into account the question of relative mobility . Light cavalry could be moved twelve squares in one turn , heavy cavalry eight , and infantry only four . If these units were sent to sections of the board in which the terrain was swampy or hilly , their progress was slower . The element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in battle . A single die was thrown to determine the outcome . Some officers must have objected to this feature , but the throw of the die was , after all , a simulation of the imponderables of the battlefield ? an untimely rainstorm , a breakdown of communications , the death of a brilliant commander , a heroic defense by a handful of men , and so on . At that , it was n't all luck when the crunch came . If a player had maneuvered three of his infantry battalions into contact with one of his enemy 's , this advantage was reflected in the " results table " ? a standard feature ? that was consulted after the throw of the dice . Throwing a 1 , 2 , or 3 , for example , would give victory by annihilation , a 4 a sharp victory , a 5 a modest advance , and only one number a 6 , say for a standoff . These principles govern the playing of war games to this day , but refinements in technique , always aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have never ceased . Throughout the nineteenth century Prussia took the lead , reflecting that country ' s military ambitions and aptitudes . One of the most avid innovators was Helmuth von Moltke , who was to become the chief of staff of the German Army and the architect of victory in the Franco-Prussian War . Subsequently , all the great powers went in for war games . Vast topographical models of famous battlefields of the past and likely battleCLEAN CARNAGE fields of the future were built . At each end of the table senior officers and their staffs , moustaches waxed , monocles glittering , worked out their tactics , wrote their orders , and passed them to an umpire , who relayed them to the underlings who actually moved the counters . War games were refined to the point that they were played in real time . If it was calculated that a unit of cavalry could gallop a mile in three or four minutes , the other side had only that amount of time to figure out what to do . Sometimes portions of a battlefield were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a real engagement , and the officers were required to rely on written reports . Such games are still played in military headquarters around the world , but for the most part they involve localized encounters with smaller units . At the same time , games far bigger than any von Moltke could have imagined are being played by computer . For twenty years at least , the major powers have been programming computers to reflect the global scope and extraordinary destructiveness that warfare among them would be likely to involve . These war games go on in the Pentagon , in the famous and sinister sub-basement War Room , and , sometimes simultaneously and sometimes separately , at Atlantic operational headquarters in Norfolk , at Pacific headquarters in Hawaii , and at NATO headquarters in Brussels . N OT LONG AFTER the convention I paid a visit to the headquarters of Simulations Publications , located in a Manhattan loft building . The founder and commanding officer of the outfit , James Dunnigan , received me in an office littered with games , records , and military magazines , reverberating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network of transparent plastic piping . This was a run for his pet gerbils . When I looked closely 1 saw several of the tiny furry creatures skittering through the system . pushing themselves upward at amazing angles , nibbling at seeds , or curled up , sleeping , in tiny gerbil bungalows . Dunnigan told me , with the faintest suggestion of hauteur , that he had thought it sufficient to send a couple of his deputies to the convention . Simulations Publications was now number one in the war-games race , with an estimated income of $1.7 million in 1975 compared with $1.2 million or thereabouts for Avalon Hill . What was more important , he said , was that the war-game industry was growing rapidly and even starting to become profitable . The boornlet began in the late 19605 and has picked up steam since the end of the Vietnam war . The circulation of Strategy &; Tactics , his firm 's bimonthly magazine , has increased to more than 30,000 . Moves , the firm 's bimonthly devoted to advanced game techniques , has a circulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rumpled man of thirty-two , is unusual among war-games aficionados for having been in uniform . He enlisted in the Army after high school . While he was serving in Korea as a missile technician he discovered the early Avalon Hill war games and was hooked . While attending Columbia University after his discharge , he worked part time as a designer for Avalon Hill . In 1969 Dunnigan founded Simulations Publications , mainly because he thought Avalon Hill did n't pay enough attention to the historical aspects of war games . " I consider myself more a historian than a war-gamer , " he told me . The company now has forty full-lime employees and a host of volunteers who come in on Friday nights to test games that are under development . Simulations Publications has issued more than 100 games , ranging from the campaigns of Alexander the Great to confrontations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Eastern Bloc , or between the Soviet Union and China . Dunnigan has lectured at the Military Affairs Club at West Point . Last spring thirty cadets visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Players in the military , including a couple of generals , correspond with him and often drop in when they are in the city . One night recently I watched a testing session myself .
