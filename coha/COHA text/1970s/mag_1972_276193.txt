In the aftermath of President Nixon 's slashing attack on busing , the nation continued to slip away from its intention to integrate its schools . Amid a growing but still ineffective counterattack by Nixon 's critics , there were these major developments : <P> &gt;Officials of HEW , the arm of the Government that had for years pressured Southern school districts to desegregate , announced that they had lifted their threat to cut off federal funds from school districts that have not yet complied with civil rights laws-at least until Congress decides what to do about the President 's antibusing legislation . Most immediately relieved was Maryland 's Prince Georges County , which had been faced with the possible loss of some $14 million . <P> - The Justice Department , charged with enforcing civil rights laws in the courts , went into a U.S. district court in Detroit to urge postponement of a ruling on what Detroit officials must do to desegregate their schools .

When New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller endorsed Nixon 's busing moratorium and urged state education officials to review their probusing policies , he was stiffly rebuked by the New York Board of Regents , which supervises all public education in the state . " In a multiracial society , " a Regents statement said , " a person can not be considered educated if he remains unexposed on a personal basis to the cultural richness and the individual diversity of his neighbors . " <P> - The fate of the President 's busing moratorium and proposals for improving inferior schools remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support , they are opposed by some key committee chairmen , including the House Education Committee 's Carl Perkins of Kentucky . As hearings opened in a Senate subcommittee , HEW Secretary Elliot Richardson defended Nixon 's proposals . Missouri Democrat Thomas Eagleton bluntly branded Richardson 's arguments for the President 's compensatory education plan " hypocritical hogwash. "
