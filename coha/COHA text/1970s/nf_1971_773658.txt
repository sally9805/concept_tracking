txt // wheats , wild Einkorn and wild Emmer , were domesticated , together with wild barley . Rye and oats came much later , at first as weeds of wheat and barley fields ; their advantage was their capacity to give good yields in more northern climates than wheat would stand . The earliest known civilizations , those of Syria , Mesopotamia , and the valley of the Indus , occupy an area roughly coinciding with the distribution of the wild ancestors of wheat and barley , and the civilizations of Europe and Western Asia are founded on the productivity of these two plant species . The domestication of animals for food began at about the same time as cereal cultivation . The dog had preceded agriculture , as an adjunct to hunting . Cattle , sheep , goats and pigs were brought in early . The use of the horse , ass , ox and camel for transport and traction came later . The early stages of settled agriculture , with both cultivated cereals and domestic herds , have been most studied at the ancient settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mesopotamia . It is at the latter that the use of sheep 's wool for clothing is first recorded , probably 4000 years before the present era . Dairy farming also seems to have begun in Mesopotamia , perhaps 1000 years later . The type of culture associated with the most primitive agriculture is called neolithic ? the culture of the new stone age . The Maoris of New Zealand were still at this stage in 1800 . Our knowledge of the neolithic phase throughout the world is exceedingly fragmentary , but agriculture probably arose independently in several regions . Certainly the maize and potato agriculture of Central and South America owes nothing to the ancient Egyptians , and in China that based on millet and the pig may have been a separate development . Wherever it was adopted agriculture had the most profound effects on human life . Its primary function was to ensure a greater and more reliable supply of food , but in doing so it made possible a vast number of new techniques and activities which , in their combined effects , transformed man from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The earliest agricultural communities were probably ten to twenty times as large as the nomadic groups of savagery . Among several hundred persons , specialization of labour became possible , and this in turn gave . rise to more complex and more skilled operations . Among the earliest trades so established were those of the weaver , the potter , and the flint // polisher . There was at this stage , however , no major technical advance from savagery , apart from the development of agriculture and stock-breeding themselves . The possibility of great technical developments depended , in the first place , on the acquisition of sufficient skill to produce a surplus of food from the soil . This made possible the existence of people , such as skilled flint workers and other specialists , who produced no food for themselves . An important contribution to farming technique was made by the traction plough ? the plough drawn by oxen ( or , later , by the horse ) : this greatly increased the arable area that one man could cultivate . The use of domestic animals as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another technique of the greatest value was that of irrigation , which was developed on a large scale in Egypt and Mesopotamia . The immediate consequence of these advances is illustrated in the Faiyum : in this prosperous community of between 6000 and 5000 B.C. there were two groups of silos , numbering sixty-seven and ninety-eight respectively ; each held , on the average , about 400 kg of grain , which was probably the yield of two or three acres . This figure , then a great achievement , is low by modern standards . In the 19505 in England and Wales an average of about 1350 kg of wheat was produced per acre , and in Ontario about 1000 kg ( but this was high for North America ) . CIVILIZATION Civilization has been called the culture of cities . Cities are themselves primarily large gatherings of men not engaged on food production . They are , of course , much more than that also . They appear first in the valleys of the Nile in Egypt , the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia , the Indus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A further , separate civilization arose in Central and South America . We have seen that an important function of a food surplus is to support workers in crafts and industries other than agriculture and stockbreeding . The surplus , however , does more than that . From very early it was also a basis for trade . Certain important commodities are found only in a few places : raw materials such as flint , and later copper , tin and iron were mined and transported long distances , either in the crude state or in the form of finished products such as // axes , vessels , shields or ornaments ; and other consumer goods such as pottery and trinkets entered largely into the trade of early civilization . As human communities became more complex , they came to need a central administration , a legal system , and machinery for keeping order and enforcing the law . Cities were the centres , therefore , not only of craftsmanship and trade , but also of administration ; and the food surplus had to support a ruling class of priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food . This was the origin of the state , the apparatus of government and control by a small ruling class . A series of new discoveries and inventions followed . In the fourth millennium B.C. , that is , between five and six thousand years ago , the wheel was invented , and used both for transport and in the making of pottery . Oversea trade led to the development of the sailing ship , and this in turn to the establishment of navigational methods . Navigation requires a knowledge of the stars , and so is one of the sources of the science of astronomy . The other early source is the needs of agriculture itself , since to plan the sowing of crops according to the seasons a calendar is required . The great pyramid of Egypt is so designed that the dog-star , Sirius , is visible in a central chamber only at the equinoxes . The Egyptians had a year of 365 days and no leap year , and this calendar was probably used first in 4242 B.C. Knowledge of astronomy and of the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest-kings , and since this knowledge was a source of their power , we can guess that they guarded it jealously : they provide an early example of the restriction of learning to a particular class . The association between religion and the calendar is exemplified in England by the famous neolithic temple at Stonehenge , which is so arranged that on midsummer day the sun rises in line with two marked points . In Egypt the needs of agriculture stimulated the growth also of geometry , owing to the necessity for re-surveying the fields each year after the Nile floods had obliterated all landmarks . The history of ancient civilizations illustrates very clearly the way in which the development of science is related to human needs . The use of written numbers and alphabetic scripts dates from about 3000 B.C. , and is contemporary with the Asiatic discovery of bronze . At this time the civilization of the Indus valley had reached a very high level of development . Among the technical problems // that arise in all cities are the supply of clean water and the disposal of liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River Indus , there was a well-organized system of aqueducts and drains , and there is evidence of town-planning by the city government . Civilization not only creates material wealth and an elaborate technology , but by making leisure possible it leads also to development of the arts . At the same time the media for artistic expression are augmented . The artists of the higher savagery took advantage of the leisure made possible by a plentiful game supply to paint and draw on cave walls and on bone . The artists of civilization could express themselves also as architects , with inorganic materials for building ; and in Egypt a heptatonic musical scale was invented . In this way , on the basis of a successful agriculture , the main features of all civilizations up to 200 years ago were developed nearly 5000 years before the industrial revolution in Europe . Even a money economy was established in Mesopotamia . Between the ancient civilizations and the present there was a long period of continuing , slow technical and economic change . Stone implements gradually gave place to metal : at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , to make bronze ; later still iron , which is more difficult to extract from its ores but far more plentiful , came into general use , and only now , in the twentieth century , are other materials , such as aluminium , replacing it for some purposes . There were improvements in power production . First , water power , which began to be used in the late Roman Empire , for processes such as grinding wheat and separating ores , became very important in some areas ; second , the invention of the horse collar in medieval times , in place of a strangling yoke , greatly increased the effective muscular power of horses . This , with the invention of iron horseshoes , enabled the farmers of the middle ages to cultivate lands hitherto inaccessible to the plough . Another simple invention , the stirrup , gave the mounted knight , for a time , military supremacy ? until yet a further technical innovation , gunpowder , unhorsed him . With the development of wood pumps men were able to mine more deeply and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities increased correspondingly . New techniques and new ideas came from many lands . The Chinese provided sailors with the magnetic compass ; and with the introducMAN // tion of the rudder , and the invention of methods for sailing into the wind , sail conquered the high seas . China also provided gunpowder ? a decisive instrument of war until the other side acquired it ; and , again from China , came paper and printing ? both essential for the foundation of a large educated community . Economically , the great iron age civilizations of the Mediterranean ? of Italy , Greece , Palestine and North Africa ? were based largely on slavery , at least for industrial production . Productive and other manual work was done by classes sharply marked off as of inferior status , and a small ruling group had the prerogative of administration and access to a good education . The consequent separation of those with clerical knowledge from the people with practical skills had an ill effect on technical and scientific development which is still reflected in administration and education today . In Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to feudalism , under which the cultivator was typically a serf , limited to working on one particular patch of soil . This led to an increase in the productivity of the soil in the temperate forest area , where regular rotation of crops became customary . It was accompanied by the development of guilds of craftsmen and merchants which led to an improved status for their members . The conventional account of the middle ages is that given by historians interested primarily in political and perhaps economic history , and in the arts . Here we are concerned rather with techniques , and especially those which played an important part in agricultural and industrial production . Some historians indeed consider that this aspect is a key to the understanding of the period . In the words of an American , Lynn White : The cumulative effect of the newly available animal , water and wind power upon the culture of Europe has not been carefully studied . But from the twelfth and even from the eleventh century there was rapid replacement of human by non-human energy wherever great quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simple and monotonous that a man could be replaced by a mechanism . The chief glory of the later Middle Ages was not its cathedrals or its epics or its scholasticism : it was the building for the first time in history of a complex civilization which rested not on the backs of sweating slaves or coolies but primarily on non-human power . // THE SCIENTIFIC AGE Today civilization has begun a change greater than any of those of the past . It is taking place with remarkable rapidity on the historical time-scale , though with painful slowness for those who live through it . In 185o , in Western Europe , the efforts of three-quarters of the population were needed to provide a food surplus adequate for the remaining quarter not engaged in food production . Today , in advanced areas , the figures are reversed : one quarter produce enough surplus for three-quarters of the population . In such countries as France , the United States and New Zealand ( all of which normally export food ) fifty per cent of the population live in towns . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , the figure is eighty per cent . On the other hand , in the whole of Asia , where , except in the U.S.S.R. , modern agricultural techniques have , until recently , hardly been practised , only about fifteen per cent of the population are reckoned to be town dwellers . The change in agricultural productivity per man is partly a reflexion of the technical advance of industry . The invention of machines which enable us to make use of the energy in coal and oil has made it possible , in the advanced countries , to replace the muscle power , not only of man but now also of domestic animals , by more effective installations . Large numbers of workers have been released from food production , with a great potential increase in material wealth and leisure . This state of affairs is at once based on and has led to the development of our knowledge of the physical sciences . The other basis of modern agriculture is applied biology , of which some features are discussed in the next chapter . The economic counterpart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of Europe by the end of the nineteenth century . Under capitalism not only land , but also capital goods such as mines , factories and transport services , are privately owned ; or if they are not , they are operated by a state which is itself controlled by the owners of large capital installations . It was indeed the single control of big productive units that made the large scale application of modern techniques possible : previously the individual craftsman had often owned his own tools and equipment , but a blast furnace , the machinery for a mine , or a steam loom , could not be worked by single individuals , or even by a family ; // in practice they were worked by a number of wage-earners and owned by the employer . Today capitalism in its turn has in some countries already been replaced by yet a further economic system , socialism , under which private ownership is restricted to personal property , and the means of production are communally owned and controlled . None of these phases of human society is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this applies to palaeolithic cultures . The great invention of agriculture itself seems to have been made separately by widely different groups . Again , the early civilization of the Indus has been described as the product of peoples of mixed origin and diverse racial types ' . The various prehistoric cultures of Europe are often attributed to groups of contrasted physical types , such as tall long-heads ' and lightly built round-heads ' . Certainly the various migrant or conquering groups differed on the average in such physical characters as stature or cephalic index , but there was continual intermingling of peoples and exchange of ideas and techniques . In the same way , today , the modern culture originating in western Europe has been absorbed , in many of its features , by such diverse groups as the New Zealand Maoris , the Japanese , and recently primitive peoples in northern Siberia . In the first nine chapters of this book the topic has been human diversity in time and space : what determines human differences , and the social consequences of the differences . But when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entity ? not indeed , because there is any uniformity of cultures , but because wherever he is , and of whatever type , man has certain fundamental problems to solve . The different kinds of society , with their various types of economy and techniques , represent his attempts to solve those problems in the varied circumstances in which he lives . Among them are the three great biological ones : the supply of food , which has already been partly discussed in this chapter ; the prevention of infectious disease ; and the maintenance of the population by the bearing of children . These are the subjects of the next four chapters . la FOOD AND SOIL One of the most ruinous limiting factors is the capitalistic system ? and this is one of the gravest criticisms that can be leveled against it . The methods of free competition and the application of the profit motive have been disastrous to the land ... . Throughout virtually the entire world , land is not used to produce the crop best adapted to it on a permanent basis but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and as quickly as possible ? the same system exalted by the manufacturer . WILLIAM VOGT Chief of Conservation Section , Pan-American Union , in 1948 I N 1954 a hydrogen bomb was tested at Bikini . The explosion produced the expected radio-active fall-out on a number of Pacific islands , and also scattered debris over thousands of square miles . As a result , dangerous radio-active materials appeared in the small plants which live in the surface of the sea ; these were eaten by small animals which in turn were eaten by larger animals , notably the tuna fish which are an important article of diet in Japan . Hence a number of Japanese ingested quantities of radio-active food . This disgraceful occurrence reminds us that we are not set apart from nature , but are inextricably involved in the nexus of living organisms . On a cosmic scale , our planet is a cinder of matter , revolving around an average star . On the faintly irregular surface of this cinder is a patchy film of carbon compounds which contains all the million or more species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species - or even within them - the most prominent feature of their relationships is interdependence . The whole of tellurian life may be regarded as a macrobe ' . For one species to survive and prosper within this macrobe , it must be in equilibrium with the rest . To descend to a more familiar scale , some parts of the world have supported prosperous peasant communities for many centuries - even millennia . Famines may have occurred ; but on the whole the 208 // peoples of the most fertile regions have grown rice , wheat or maize and have lived in equilibrium with their environment . The soil has been conserved ; pests have not multiplied calamitously ; floods and drought have been prevented ; natural forests have been left standing in spaces between cultivated regions . The important innovations ? new strains of plants and animals , new techniques and new systems of management ? have originated in these stable areas . Nevertheless , none of the advances in food production has yet prevented food shortages . Increased food supplies lead also to great increases in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails the disaster is correspondingly great . This sort of thing is familiar enough to biologists : animal populations are prevented from indefinite increase by limiting factors , and food supply is sometimes the factor which determines the maximum size of a population . Other possible factors are the amount of space for breeding , and the number and efficiency of predators or parasites : for instance , the cats of a village may influence the maximum population of mice . Man himself is a limiting factor , or creates such factors , for many animal and plant populations : in the attempt to grow or to capture food for himself he is obliged to reduce the food available for other species , to destroy their living-space and sometimes to kill them directly , either because they themselves provide food or because they interfere with his activities . There is thus a complex interaction between human populations and the populations of other species , both plant and animal , in all the regions of the land and sea where man lives or works . The study of this interaction , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for many reasons , including the fact that it is a necessity for a scientific agriculture . The need for science in farming has become especially obvious during the twentieth century . One reason for this is the increasing consciousness of what scientific method can do , when it is applied to such problems as the improvement of soil or the breeding of better strains of crop plants or domestic animals . A second reason has been the enormous scale of human food production during this century , accompanying the increase of human populations in every continent ; these changes have led to disruption of balanced communities of animals and plants in many parts of the world , and consequent loss of soil 2I0 LIFE AND DEATH fertility and other natural resources . Yet a third reason is that , for the first time , feeding the world is being considered as a single problem : as we shall see in the next chapter , it is now possible to say with some precision what constitutes an optimum diet , and to show that many people do not get one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dense populations and advanced techniques , are a measure of the success of agriculture in providing a surplus of food beyond the needs of the producers ; this success is reflected also in the recent rapid growth of human populations , of which the figures are given in chapter 14 . These expanding human communities have displaced previously existing communities of other species . In North America , for instance , when European colonization began , the number of indigenous human beings was of the order of 1m. , but there were probably Som . bison , and vast herds of other large mammals such as elk , deer , caribou , antelope , and moose . All these species now exist in only small numbers , or are on the verge of extinction . It is believed that in Canada alone there were Som . beavers , and this number was reduced to 1m. before protection was introduced . There has been a similar destruction of large mammals in East and South Africa . More obviously , increasing human numbers , and the expanding need for more agricultural land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . Britain and Western Europe , for instance , were formerly for the most part forest lands except in the higher mountains , but only small wooded patches now remain . Changes of this sort are , up to a point , inevitable if large human communities are to exist at all . They can , however , lead to further changes which in the long run make a prosperous agriculture impossible . The most serious of these changes are in the soil . If forests are removed from sloping ground in areas of fairly high rainfall , the soil , deprived of its protective covering , is liable to be washed away down to bare , unproductive rock . This is water erosion , and it is going on now in great areas of fertile ground in the Americas , Africa , and Asia . ( Soil erosion must be distinguished from the much slower process of rock erosion referred to in the chapter on evolution . ) Another form of water erosion takes place in the plains FOOD AND SOIL 2II below the despoiled hills : a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rivers and streams ; instead of flowing at an even rate they dry up in the dry season and during the rains become raging torrents which cut deep grooves , or gullies , in the soil of the plains . In the dry season , on the other hand , there is drought : the soil dries and becomes powdery , and may be blown away , as is seen in plate 15 . The same result often comes from loss of plant cover due to overgrazing . This is wind erosion , and the spectacular effects it sometimes produces have made it famous . Fairfield Osborn describes the shock that came to the people of America in 1934 ' : In that year a vast transcontinental dust-laden windstorm , darkening the sun , broadcast the fact that large once-fertile portions of five western states . . . had become a desolate dust bowl . This catastrophe was the result of overgrazing by too large herds of cattle and sheep and of ploughing for crops grasslands that should never have been converted to this use . H. H. Bennett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short life of this country we have essentially destroyed 282m. acres of land , crop , and rangeland . Erosion is destructively active on 775m. additional acres . About loom . acres of cropland , much of it representing the best cropland we have , is finished in this country . We can not restore it . It takes nature from 300 years to I000 years or more to bring back a single inch of topsoil and we sometimes lose that topsoil as the result of a single rain , if it is an especially heavy torrential type of rain . The first examples of soil destruction have been taken from North America because that area has been very fully studied , and because there the destruction has been exceptionally rapid . But every other continent has suffered erosion , and it is believed that a total of nearly 200m. acres is affected . Some extinct civilizations seem to have been helped on their way by the disappearance of their agricultural resources . The Maya civilization of Guatemala created deserts by the destruction of forests , just as today the soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of ill-planned attempts to cultivate land on the steep slopes of the mountains . North Africa was once an area of a dominant civilization , but is now principally desert ; this could probably have been prevented with a different system of II 2I2 LIFE AND DEATH cultivation . The area between the Tigris and Euphrates was once , in Osborn 's words , a land suggestive of the Garden of Eden , a rich land whose people lived well , built flourishing cities , established governments and developed the arts ' . Its degeneration into desert seems to have been helped by the cutting down of forests , perhaps by over-grazing of grassland , and finally by the wrecking of the irrigation works which coincided with political collapse . It is not suggested here that the collapse of these ancient civilizations is to be simply explained by defects in their methods of land management . It might indeed be argued that the errors of the farmers should be attributed to imperfections of economic or political organization , and that these were the significant causes of collapse . The facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once fertile lands by a series of civilized communities , from three thousand years ago up to the present day . It has been suggested that these calamities have been brought about , not by man 's activities , but by climatic influences . Climate has obviously played a part , but it is extremely doubtful whether this can anywhere have been a decisive one . Serious soil erosion occurs only where agriculture is practised ; it follows that climate can be blamed for it only if there have been climatic changes for the worse since agriculture began . There is little evidence for such changes ; olive groves can still be made to flourish in North Africa , in the very places where they were cultivated by the Roman colonists ; indeed , a few have survived the past two thousand years . Palestine , extensively eroded , can nevertheless support the same crops as were grown in biblical times , given proper care . In India and China there has been much erosion , but alongside the areas of bare rock are terraced and irrigated lands which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be considered as anything but man-made . The material destruction of soil is the final result of bad land management , and much damage can be done before erosion itself occurs . In Africa the Sahara is said to be advancing in some areas at the rate of half a mile a year , but this is only one consequence of the mismanagement of the grass-covered savannahs . The great plains of North Africa , potentially fertile and capable of carrying a prosperous agriculture , have a dry season which is sometimes as long as eight months ; only a carefully preserved plant cover , either // of grasses or larger plants , can prevent severe drying and loss of fertility . Excessive grazing by domestic animals , of which the goat is particularly destructive , is in vast areas eating away the plant cover , and ruining the land . From America Vogt gives another example : Virgin soils in Ohio , with unimproved seed and no insect control , yielded a hundred bushels of corn per acre , and sixty bushels of wheat . Crops now average forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this yield per acre in one of the most advanced states in the Union , where there is greatly increased knowledge of disease and pest control , fertilizers and plant breeding , is being maintained with difficulty and at great expense . THE BALANCE OF NATURE ' Soil erosion and loss of fertility can be regarded as results of the upsetting of a natural balance or equilibrium . Forests or grassy plains can remain stable for very long periods ; rivers change their character only through millions of years . If there are grazing animals their numbers may be restricted by predators ( such as lions ) , by the water supply , or by other limiting factors . Soil losses are made good , probably more than made good , by material derived from dead plants and animals . Agriculture can not avoid upsetting this balance . The vital necessity is that it should be replaced by another equilibrium , one chosen by man to suit his own ends . This is not only a matter of preserving the soil : it involves also allowing for the activities of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unexpectedly , affected by agriculture . The most obvious of these species are the pests , and especially those which attack crops in the fields . By greatly increasing the growth of some plants , particularly cereals , man has created conditions favourable for the rapid multiplication of various fungi , insects , and rodents , many of which had probably been hitherto comparatively rare species . The most spectacular of the onslaughts on our crops are those due to locusts ; there are seven important species , and between them they cover the Americas , Africa , the Near East , central Asia , India , China , Indonesia , and Australia . Unwise cultivation may increase the number of swarming grounds . In the Americas plagues of the related grasshoppers cause similar damage as well . Other spectacular // disasters to field crops are due to field mice : the grain-producing areas of Europe , Asia , and North America are subject to periodic plagues of small rodents which do damage on a scale similar to that of locusts . The third main group of pests are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century and caused the total loss of the potato crop in Ireland in 1846 ; in 1870 another fungus , a leaf rust , wiped out the coffee plantations of Ceylon , and the country was saved from ruin only by the establishment of the tea industry . In Central America and the West Indies the Panama disease has come near to causing the complete destruction of banana cultivation . 11 These dramatic effects of pests and disease organisms are well enough known , and they are of first-rate importance . But a great proportion of the food losses due to pests goes on continuously and unobtrusively : the pests are there all the time , and they take their regular toll which may account for ten or fifty per cent of the total . This is especially the case with the losses of stored food . Food may be stored by peasants in a rolled mat , a bamboo cylinder , or a pit in the ground ; by farmers in corn rick or barn ; by merchants in warehouse or silo : in all these places the concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weevils and other insects , mites , and moulds . So universal are these pests that throughout the world farmers and warehouse-keepers often regard their presence as inevitable . World transport has further ensured that , however narrow the original range of a particular species , it has good opportunities of spreading to every country in which suitable conditions exist : the brown spider beetle , as one example , which probably came from Tasmania , has so spread during the past 70 years that it is now found in every grain warehouse in Europe and North America . These are examples of fairly direct and simple connexions between human activities and changes in animal and plant populations . There are many more complex interactions . In North America agriculture chronically suffers severe losses from small rodents . These pests are preyed on by carnivorous mammals , such as foxes , by birds of prey , and by snakes . All these predators have been systematically persecuted by farmers , and by those who preserve game , who have thus , in all probability , greatly increased the rodent damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some // farming communities favour the careful preservation of hedgerows and small woodlots , others destroy them . There is in fact a strong case for keeping such semi-natural communities of plants and animals : they add beauty to the countryside ; and they also help the farmer . Research in Germany has made it possible to estimate that hedgerows increase grain yields by twenty per cent in some conditions of farming : one of their effects is to reduce the evaporation of water from the fields by cutting down the force of drying winds ; this can be equivalent to increasing the rainfall by one-third ? an extremely important factor in rather dry areas with fertile soils . They are also nesting places for small birds and spiders which eat injurious insects , and for humble bees which pollinate clover and other desirable flowering plants . Incidentally , hedgerows are an important source of timber . And the trees give shade , not only to people but also to domestic animals . It is doubtful whether the increased area for ploughing , acquired by destroying the hedges and replacing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced communities of plants and animals is very general . It has been illustrated , especially in recent decades , in two ways . First , increasingly vast areas have been planted with single crops such as wheat or coniferous trees . This provides parasites and pests of crop plants with the ideal opportunity to multiply with explosive speed and to cause the maximum amount of damage in conditions in which the difficulties of prevention or control are greatest . Second , more and more species of plants , animals and fungi have been taken across the world , deliberately or by accident , from their usual ranges to somewhere quite new . Once in a new environment , uncontrolled by their natural enemies , they may spread widely and disrupt the stable systems of organisms which have evolved together for tens of millions of years . A famous example is the insect called the cottony cushion scale ( a bug ' , or Hemipteran , related to green-fly ) from Australia , which got into the orange groves of California and threatened to destroy them . Fumigation with hydrogen cyanide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyanide-resistant strain . Eventually , after much loss and great expenditure , it was brought under control by bringing in another insect from Australia ; this was a ladybird beetle which is a predator living largely on the scale bugs . This is an outstanding , and rather unusual , example of biological control . Another // example is the Asian fungus , called chestnut blight , which was introduced into the U.S.A. about 1900 and in fifty years had killed all the native sweet chestnuts except some in the extreme south . This fungus is harmless in its native areas . In this case the only remedy , after vast losses had occurred , was to introduce the Chinese chestnut which is not harmed by the fungus . The example of the scale bugs illustrates two attitudes . One response to pests , parasites , weeds , inconvenient trees and other obstructions is to try to alter the ecological pattern , and to achieve a new equilibrium . The other is to attack them directly . The second method gets rid of unwanted organisms without regard to the total effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success ; but it can also have unintended consequences . The famous insecticide , DDT , has had immensely beneficial effects in killing disease carriers such as mosquitoes , and insect pests of farm crops . At first sight this triumph of modern chemical industry seems an unqualified blessing . But , on examination , it has proved also to be a menace . DDT is poisonous , not only to the insects we wish killed , but also to birds and mammals , including ourselves . It is a very stable substance , and it has been used on a vast scale . Hence it is increasingly circulating among living things : it has been absorbed into the natural cycles of matter , on which all organisms depend . D D T is now in the air we breathe , and hence in the bodies of animals all over the world ? even the Antarctic penguins ? and the fatty tissue of human beings . When an animal dies , the DDT it contains returns to the soil or the sea , where it is picked up again by plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large areas , in order to kill insect pests . About half of it is then carried as crystals into the upper air , where it is dispersed like radio-active fall-out . The concentration of DDT varies greatly among different species , since it depends largely on the position the species occupies in food chains . First a plant is eaten by a plant-eating animal ; in the sea or fresh water this may be anything from a microscopic crustacean to a large fish , and on land , from a mite to an elephant . Many plant-eating animals are themselves eaten by predators such as salmon , owls , weasels and men . Some of these are in turn eaten by larger predators . As DDT ascends a food chain , its concentration increases . Plants may contain by weight less than a tenth of one part per million ; at the other end a large predator may contain // twenty-five to seventy-five parts per million . These concentrations are rising . At about ten times their present levels they can kill ; at lower levels they can prevent breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be fully predicted . If many predators are killed , one result can be the proliferation of pests which would otherwise be eaten by them . Eventually , after disastrous upheavals , many species might , by a kind of natural selection , become resistant . But at present the only species known to include resistant forms are among the flies and other insects which DDT was designed to eliminate . At least one government , that of New Zealand , has already , in the 196os , banned the use of large numbers of substances which could be a danger to livestock ; some , such as aldrin , dieldrin and DDT itself , are household words for farmers all over the world . Eventually , no doubt , there will be international agreements to regulate the use of all dangerous or dubious poisons . Many more examples could be given of the workings of the living nexus in relation to man . Some could be of successes ; others of dangers or disasters . But the main lesson is obvious . Whether we are concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with conservation or with building new cities , we need to know what we are doing , what is happening to other species and what is likely to happen to them in the future . This holds for the sea as well as for the land . Only deliberate planning , on the largest scale , based on detailed knowledge ( which entails much more research ) , can any longer keep our own species in a satisfactory relationship with other organisms whether these are useful , harmful , beautiful or apparently neutral . FEEDING THE WORLD So far in this chapter the emphasis has been on difficulties and problems . But the history of food production is not one only of blunders and mismanagement . There are examples even of very primitive groups in which admirable principles of land management have been applied . In New Guinea some of the mountain dwellers , with a neolithic economy , use a system of crop rotation combined with terracing which ensures the preservation of the soil and its fertility ; they also use the vegetation for green manure , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring peoples use a system of ditching which both drains swamps and also provides new , unexhausted soil to spread over the surface . In many parts of Africa the Africans have used crop rotations in which leguminous plants are sown at regular intervals to replenish the nitrogen of the soil . The most important principles of land management , such as irrigation and drainage , terracing , manuring and plant selection seem to have been developed independently in the Old World and the Americas , some of them before civilization began in either group of continents . All the great civilizations have depended on a successful and stable agriculture . We have seen that some , such as those of North Africa and the Near East , collapsed and their agriculture with them . But others have continued . Large areas of China have sustained a stable agriculture for thousands of years , by the use of irrigation , terracing to prevent erosion , and extensive manuring ( commonly with human excrement ) to preserve fertility . There is , however , considerable erosion both in China and India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful and evenly distributed rainfall , and the relative flatness of much of the ground , have made possible an even more stable system of cultivation ; moreover , since Western Europe was the original home of modern science , scientific methods have been extensively applied there , and so the productivity of both arable land and animal stocks is quite high . The problem which now faces the whole of humanity is to develop these existing systems so that every human being is adequately fed . How far short of this they fall today can be only roughly estimated ; some of the estimates are given in the next chapter . But hundreds of millions chronically suffer actual hunger , and even more are malnourished . Moreover the population of the world is increasing at the rate of 2om. a year . The next chapter deals with this problem from the point of view of the needs of human beings as consumers of food . Here we are concerned with production . The total land surface of the world is 36,000m. acres , but the greater part of this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The limiting factor is water : the annual rainfall must be at least fifteen inches for cultivation to be possible , and there are difficulties if it is less than eighteen inches ; in equatorial lands , with high evaporation , the necessary minimum rises to forty // inches . It is estimated that on this basis about one-third of all land could be cultivated . To what extent is this 12,000m. acres actually used by the two-thirds of humanity who still live on the land ? The answers to this question vary with the method of estimation . Probably about ten per cent of all land , or less than one-third of the land that could be used , is in fact cultivated , but only four per cent of all land is used for crops which provide human food : of total land surface : land that could be cultivated = 34 per cent land that is cultivated = to per cent land used for human food = 4 per cent These estimates imply that there remain enormous areas still to be opened up , but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy , within a few years , greatly to increase the world 's cultivated area . Two hundred years ago there were vast fertile plains in the New World , Australia , and elsewhere , waiting to be ploughed and sown with wheat . Today all the easy ground has been occupied ( and some of it , as we have seen , plundered ) . A great deal of what remains is tropical forest . Despite the difficulties , attempts are already being made to cultivate the tropics . Modern machinery , such as bulldozers , and the new insecticides , have helped to make such projects feasible . On the general prospect of the use of forest lands a recent report of the Food and Agriculture Organization is optimistic : Here is virtually a new continent , the unused forest , equal in area to the whole of Asia ( excluding the U.S.S.R. ) , which remains to be explored and used for human benefit . These forests could contribute not only fuel and lumber but also , by chemical transformation , pulp , plastics , sugar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that in time they will provide a large proportion of the world 's clothing materials and animal feeding stuffs , thus releasing important areas of cropland for food crops . When the attempt is made to develop a backward area , or even , perhaps , an advanced one , special problems may arise with the human population . At first sight it might appear that a big productive scheme would be certain to benefit the native inhabitants of the area , but in fact it can do so only if their customs and needs are properly considered . Primitive customs are quite unadapted to // modern , large-scale agriculture . It follows that , unless a policy of ruthless exploitation and contempt for native needs and abilities is adopted , all such schemes must include provision for education and a general raising of living standards . The need for the planning of an area as a whole , and for ensuring that those taking part do so willingly and with knowledge of its value to themselves , has been recognized in a number of big schemes of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority is an example of what modern engineering can do to make soil fertile by irrigation , provided that all possible means are used for the development of the area , including education and financial help . Similar schemes have been proposed for the Missouri Valley , for the Jordan River in Palestine , for various Indian rivers , for the Niger River in French West Africa , and for a number of others . The Amazon Basin is the subject of a United Nations plan . One of the biggest schemes began during the 1930s in a vast area of the U.S.S.R. A very large part of the Soviet Union is too cold for ordinary agriculture ( which is one reason why so much work has been done there on cold-resistant wheats and other crops ) ; and of the remaining land much is liable to severe drought . The remedy in the dry areas is irrigation , and this is planned on an unprecedented scale . An area the size of Europe , west of the Caspian , until recently desert , is being transformed , not only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of scientific agriculture , from pest control to the study of the mechanics of soil particles . THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURE Although vast schemes of conservation and development are essential , they are not the only means of increasing food production . Throughout the world agricultural methods remain for the most part primitive and , without increasing the cultivated area or any drastic change of method , production could be greatly raised . The output of food per man in advanced countries is estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization to be about ten times what it is in the backward lands . The population of the backward areas is nearly three-quarters of the world 's total . In Britain the productivity per acre and the output per man are three or four times higher // than even the more backward areas of Europe ; and on the average about four times as much milk is produced by each cow . Yet even British farming could be improved , since some farms , in which every advantage is taken of technical improvements , have a productivity twice that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield a greater increase of food than could be got from tropical development . The general , all-round raising of the standards of cultivation depends on the systematic improvement of every aspect of farming practice . Improvement is needed , and is practicable , in the plants and animals themselves ; in the fertility of the soil ; in the control of weeds and of animal and fungal pests ; and in the number and design of the machines used . // The milk yields of many herds , even in Western Europe and the U.S.A. , can be doubled in two generations by proper breeding ; such breeding can be greatly accelerated by the use of artificial insemination , which enables the best bulls to serve at least ten times as many cows as would otherwise be possible . The scope for improvement in the wretched cattle of the backward areas of the East is far greater . Stock can also be bred for cold climates . Recently the cattalo , a hybrid between buffalo and domestic cattle , with some admixture of yak , has been produced to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle fail . The cattalo has a heavy coat ; it will eat shrubs or paw through snow to get herbage ; and it stores much fat in its body against the winter . It is an excellent source of beef . Besides the improvement of stock by breeding , much can be done by better feeding , for instance by the development of pasture of higher quality . Indeed , breeding and the improvement of stock management must go together , since breeding can be done effectively only if a suitable environment can be provided for the herd . The development of the grasslands themselves also depends partly on genetical methods : in the past it has been usual to regard grass ' as a natural phenomenon not much amenable to human interference , but today , on the best pastures , it is treated like any other crop : special seed mixtures are used , selected for the particular conditions of soil and climate , with corresponding improvement of the sward and of the livestock that feed on it . The use of special seed from selected plants is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally . A famous example is hybrid maize . The usual method of preserving a good strain of plant or animal species is to inbreed among individuals of the strain ( as was described in chapter 2 ) so as to preserve the favourable genetical qualities ; but if this is done with maize a loss of yield results . Inbred lines are therefore grown only by seedsmen in breeding stations : to produce the seed for the farmer the inbred lines are crossed , and hybrid seed is distributed for use on the farms , where it gives a high yield . Hybrid maize has made possible yields twenty-five per cent higher than before , and more than ninety per cent of the maize now sown in the Corn Belt of the United States is hybrid . Breeding is capable of producing not only improved varieties , but // quite new types with unexpected combinations of characters . Much has been done on these lines in the U.S.S.R. ( There is a story of some botanists trying to develop a radish-cabbage hybrid : they succeeded , only to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the root system of a cabbage . Fortunately , further effort gave the desired result . ) Among the new hybrids is perennial wheat , a result of crossing wheat with wild couch grass . One variety is drought-resistant , fungus-resistant , and has an exceptionally high gluten content . It is not cold resistant , but can be grown in the southern areas of the U.S.S.R. , where wind erosion is serious and the protection of a perennial covering for the soil is most needed . It is reported to give at least two crops a year , and of course does not require annual sowing . A better known example of the possibilities of plant breeding is the production of highly productive wheats which are also resistant to the fungus disease called stem rust , which is exceedingly destructive in North America . Much more of this sort of work remains to be done : research on rice , which is the staple food of at least one-third of mankind , is far behind that on the wheats and on maize , though what has been done has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very recently produced a record harvest . Research on millet , another important staple of the East , has hardly begun . If we turn to the improvement of the soil we find a similar picture . The importance of fertilizers and manures is well known : nearly every gardener uses both inorganic fertilizers and manure derived from a compost heap ( which may have been chemically treated ) or possibly from the leavings of horses in the street outside . Primitive systems of cultivation , as we have seen , rely on human and animal manure , and on plant residues , to replenish essential elements taken from the soil by their crops . We must still do the same , and on a larger scale ; the sewage from the great cities is a valuable source of manure , and far too little is returned to the fields ; it has been referred to as a river of valuable elements awaiting recovery . But we can also supplement the organic manures with synthetic nitrogenous substances : it has been estimated that in Britain the addition of 50 kg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase the yield of wheat by 125 kg . To get the best result potassium and phosphate must be added as well . In advanced // countries such practices are commonplace , but over the greater part of the world they remain almost unused . The quality as well as the quantity of plants can be improved by synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers . For instance , the protein content of grass can be doubled , with corresponding benefit to the livestock that feed on it . Recently , there have been important refinements in our knowledge of soil chemistry . In large areas of Australia a serious condition of livestock , called pining disease , was found to be due to a mineral deficiency of the soil which affected the plants of the pasture and through them the grazing animals . The element that was deficient was not any of those well known to be important , such as nitrogen , phosphorus , or potassium , but a comparatively rare one , cobalt . Since then similar phenomena , involving several elements besides cobalt , have been found in many parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of a systematic knowledge of the effects of soil chemistry and physics on plant growth . We still do not know as well as we should what justification there is for ploughing , harrowing or even allowing ground to lie fallow ; in the U.S.S.R. one procedure is now to plough very deep only once in every four years . We still have to discover why some plants ( lime lovers ' ) can grow only on alkaline soil , while others must have acid soil . Even the significance of humus for plant growth is controversial . Interesting research is now in progress on the use of soil improvers ? substances which increase the water-holding powers of the soil and so enable the soil to support more plant growth . If these materials prove effective , they may both increase yields in fertile lands , and contribute to the reclamation of deserts . Care of the soil requires more than attention to its chemistry . Irrigation may be needed to prevent excessive dryness and consequent loss of fertility and eventual wind erosion . Irrigation is. indeed one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley is probably the longest irrigated area in the world , but in the last half-century it has nevertheless been extensively developed , and the system changed from basin irrigation , or one-crop agriculture based on the annual flooding , to perennial irrigation which allows the growing of several crops a year . For some months in each year no Nile water enters the sea direct : the sea receives only water that has been pumped from the main drains after passage through the irrigated soil . India , with dom . acres , has the largest irrigated // area of any country , three times the area in the United States . There is nevertheless need for much more irrigation in India , and still more elsewhere , and the great river valley plans are largely based on schemes of irrigation . Erosion is controlled also by preventing loss of plant cover due to overgrazing , by the planting of woods and forests to act as windbreaks , and by special techniques such as ploughing along the contours of hills to prevent a too rapid drainage of water down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America : in areas where water erosion was serious small numbers of beavers have been introduced and allowed to build dams . In one area , where water erosion and flooding were causing loss of orchard trees , twelve beavers were released ; two years later sixty new dams had been built and the flooding greatly reduced . Beavers have been used also to conserve water for irrigation . The various methods of soil conservation are capable of bringing dramatic improvement in regions where bad management has not gone too far . Even in the notorious dust bowl of North America agricultural production is higher than ever before . The very fertility of cultivated soils , however , gives rise to special problems : having made soil fertile we inevitably encourage the growth of unwanted species as well as crop plants . But weed control has recently made great strides : substances , sometimes called plant growth hormones , which in some conditions can be used to stimulate the growth of parts of plants , can also be used as selective weedkillers ; by destroying the unwanted species , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield per acre on some agricultural land . We have already seen that , just as fertile ground attracts weeds , so does the accumulation of food on cultivated land and in stores attract animal and fungal pests . Here again we are not obliged to resign ourselves to extensive losses . The detailed study of the way of life of particular pests has made possible their large scale destruction . Locusts have for thousands of years made their inexplicable and unpredicted descents on cultivated land , leaving starvation behind them . Only since the First World War has it been found that , when they are not swarming , locusts live as harmless grasshoppers of different appearance from that of the swarming phase . Swarms develop only in limited outbreak areas and are induced partly by 8 // climatic influences , some of which are known . It is now possible to predict outbreaks of the red and the migratory locusts , in Africa , before they occur , and by the use of new insecticides , such as gammexane , the swarms can be intercepted and destroyed before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single outbreak area near the Middle Niger swept over nearly the whole of Africa , and did enormous damage . During the 1940S similar outbreaks threatened ; but by that time a control organization existed , and for the first time in history Africa survived a period of locust attack without serious loss . Much remains to be done : the desert locust , whose outbreak areas are in inaccessible desert areas of the Middle East , is still a grave menace to large areas of Asia and Africa , and is swarming as these lines are being written . But the fundamental knowledge needed for control is now available . The example of locust control is one of many . Although there are serious pests which we are still quite unable to control , and much more research will have to be done , for many species the deficiency is not so much in knowledge as in application : there is , for instance , no locust control organization in South American comparable to that in Africa . AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY Man 's relationship with his environment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . Some of the changes are for the worse , but , we have the knowledge to prevent them ; the scope of possible change for the better is incalculably great . It follows that calculations , such as those which purport to deduce the amount of arable land per head necessary for a satisfactory standard of living , can have little validity . There is one much . quoted statement , based on North American practice , that the area needed is 2.5 acres to each person ; the actual amount of arable land in the world has been variously estimated at from just over one to nearly two acres per head . But since climate , crops , land , and farming methods vary enormously from time to time , from country to country , and even from farm to farm , such statements have little significance . These calculations will have even less point if completely new methods of food production are introduced on a large scale . It has // been possible to produce sugar from wood shavings by a method known as the Bergius process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coal ; the cost is very high , though it is likely that it could be reduced with further research . Another possible source of food is the microscopic plants ? the green algae ? of sea or fresh water : the plants might be grown in shallow coastal basins with plenty of sun ; another method , already successfully tried , would be to grow them in sewage . This could yield far higher quantities of foodstuffs per acre than any conventional agriculture . By controlling the conditions in which they grow it is possible to influence the food substances manufactured by the plants : in some conditions certain species can produce a very high fat content ; in others , large amounts of protein are produced . The final product might be used for animal feeding stuffs , and so release arable land for the growing of bread grains ; fats might be used even for human food . The capital outlay required for an economically worthwhile installation might be very great ; but not greater than that needed for the production of atomic bombs . An alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ) would be atom-powered submarines designed to function as artificial // whales ; they would be vast processing factories , feeding in the most densely populated parts of the world 's oceans . Yet a further proposal involves drawing on the enormous sources of food materials in the plant leaves which are ordinarily inedible . Leaves are potentially a rich source of both protein and sugar , and it is perfectly possible to extract these substances and make a nutritious , palatable soup . The importance of these novel suggestions is that they illustrate the possibilities of technical advance . Given a practical problem , however vast , we are quite justified in turning confidently to the methods of science to solve it . The most formidable obstacles often arise only when the main technical difficulties have been overcome , and when the application of the new knowledge becomes a task for the whole community . For scientific knowledge to be applied fully it is not enough to have a few scientists , however well endowed with money and ability , working on the problems . Large organizations have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women , who can transmit the results of research to the public in general , or to particular sections such as the farming community . Nor is the relationship a simple one of the scientists telling the technicians , and the technicians telling the public . The flow of ideas is in both directions . Laboratory research is essential , but a great part of scientific agriculture has to be worked out in the fields or milking sheds . If it is to be done on an adequate scale the farmer must not only be ready to accept sound methods when they have been worked out : he must be prepared to make an actual contribution , by recording the results of applying new methods or by taking part himself in large-scale experiments . It is not enough for action to be taken on a national scale . Mankind can be adequately fed only if the problem is faced as a single one for the whole world . The existence of the Food and Agriculture Organization reflects this fact . Before the Second World War , among the absurdities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malnutrition side by side with the deliberate destruction of food , such as wheat and oranges , in producing countries : the food destroyed could not be sold at a profit , and so it was considered by the producers better to let piles of oranges rot , under the eye of an armed guard , than to distribute them to those in need . That is what happened in times of glut . In a bad year even // those who could afford to pay might be unable to get the food they wanted . In a unified world economy a surplus of wheat would be stored against a bad year ; surplus oranges would be canned , probably as juice . Similar treatment would be given to other surpluses . Much new organization and equipment would be required , perhaps on an even larger scale than that created during the war for military purposes . Up to the present , however , the pressure for a rational economy has failed to prevent complaints in North America of overproduction ' of food . By 1949 plans for restricting the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Government was destroying potatoes , and feeding millions of dollars ' worth of raisins to pigs . There were vast accumulations of dried egg ( of which some was used as fertilizer for arable land ) , of butter , and other foods . Even in the 1960s , the United Nations again reports unsaleable surpluses of cereals , dairy produce , and much else . MALTHUS TODAY In some people the world 's food problem has induced a profound pessimism . Since the Second World War apparently authoritative predictions of disaster have been made , based on increases of populations and a declining or stationary food production . The history of such predictions is a long one , beginning with the Essay on the Principle of Population first published by Malthus in 1798 . The core of the Malthusian view , in Malthus ' own words , is that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man ' . According to Malthus , where food is abundant men multiply rapidly until their numbers outrun the food supply ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not at all . These statements can perhaps sometimes be applied to animal populations in nature ; the question is , to what extent do they apply to man ? We have already seen what scope there is for increasing food production , by both conventional and unconventional methods . There are many facts of recent history , overlooked by prophets of doom , which tell a very different story from the neo-Malthusian one . Sugar production in Java is an example . In the period 1910 to 1930 productivity per hectare doubled , as a result of improved strains and // methods of cultivation . During this period the human population increased by only thirty per cent . This dramatic success for scientific agriculture so alarmed the , producers , that an international agreement was made to restrict sugar production . It is sometimes said that , whatever effort is put into food production , the law of diminishing returns ' will eventually operate , and further improvement will become impossible . This argument rests on a misunderstanding : the law of diminishing returns , as applied to agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural country will be less than those in a less densely populated country ( other things being equal ) if additional capital or improved farming methods can not be used . In practice , however , more capital or improved methods are continually being introduced . In these conditions , the law of increasing returns operates . This law states that in a modern industrial community the denser the population , and the larger the scale on which production is carried out , the greater the resulting economies . Indeed , modern industry , on which modern agriculture depends for its machines , its fertilizers and much else , depends wholly on a dense population . The population , for efficiency as well as happiness , must also be healthy . Some pessimists have expressed the remarkable view that the endemic diseases of undeveloped lands ? malaria , hookworm and the rest ? should be encouraged , or at least should not be treated , since they help to keep human numbers down . But these diseases , most of them chronic infections , also help to lower productivity . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season 's work on a scheme of malaria control increased the rice yield of the area by fifteen per cent . It is sometimes argued that , even if food supplies can be increased , population will nevertheless always outstrip them . This is what Malthus himself asserted . Yet in the past hundred years the effects of increased production in highly developed countries have usually been the opposite . Instead of a rise in fertility and a steeper population growth curve , there has been a dramatic fall in the birth-rate and the attainment of almost stationary population in many countries . In the 19305 it was fashionable to express alarm about the sterility ' of Western nations and the grim prospect of a declining and ageing population . It seems to be a general rule that improved living standards are accompanied by a decline in births . // Today , faced with formidable difficulties , both biological and economic , we can adopt one of two attitudes . We can conclude that there is nothing to look forward to but widespread famine and tens of millions of deaths from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited food and unchecked reproduction is all that can be foreseen ; or we can admit the difficulties , agree that famine threatens in many parts of the world ( as it has threatened for the past seven thousand years ) , yet nevertheless deny that this state of affairs need continue : the technical difficulties can be overcome ; economic systems can be changed ; populations can be regulated . Unmitigated gloom is rarely found among those who are actually trying to produce more food . We have seen something of the biological advances already achieved , or possible . Of equal importance are the advances in social and economic organization . The great schemes of land development and conservation , described earlier , demand unified planning and administration which can be done only by governments . A fully mechanized agriculture , making use of every means to raise production , is impossible in a system of peasant farming , with small farms worked , as a rule , by primitive means under a heavy burden of debt . Feeding the world adequately presents great difficulties , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades of effort . Nevertheless the effort has already begun ; existing biological and economic knowledge can take us far if it is applied , and it can be rapidly increased . To the extent that we fail , the failure will be a social and political one , and not a consequence of something inherent in nature and unalterable . FOOD AND NUTRITION If every just man that now pines with want Had but a moderate and beseeming share Of that which lewdly-pampered Luxury Now heaps upon some few with vast excess , Natures full blessings would be well dispenc't In unsuperfluous even proportion , And she no whit encumber 'd with her store . JOHN MILTON ONE of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century has been the growth of our knowledge of nutrition . This knowledge made it possible , in the preceding chapter , to write of adequate ' and inadequate ' diets . Today a well-devised government can have a national food policy with a scientific basis , and a housewife can plan her family 's meals scientifically . THE QUESTION OF QUANTITY The first problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person needs no telling whether he is eating enough : hunger is the guide . There is some individual variation , especially in relation to weight , but the amount needed depends mainly on the type and quantity of the work done . In this respect our bodies can quite legitimately be compared with a railway locomotive burning coal , or an automobile petrol , in proportion to distance travelled or to speed . The energy value of food is measured in kilocalories . ( A kilocalorie is the amount of heat needed to raise one kilogram of water from 15 to 16 ? C. ) An adult man of average weight lying in bed , and taking , no exercise at all , needs about 1600 kcal a day to prevent loss of weight . This is the basic quantity needed to keep us going at the lowest level of activity . An hour 's light work , such as typing or sewing , adds about seventy-five kcal to the basic need . An hour 's 232 // housework or slow walking may add between seventy-five and 15o . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , requires 300 kcal or more for each hour , and in times of shortage men doing heavy work may receive extra rations of such foods as bread and cheese . Most readers of this book consume between 2000 and 3000 kcal every day . This is the equivalent of 500 grams ( just over one pound ) of dry food such as sugar or flour . ( Most foods contain a lot of water . ) This disposes of the notion that a scientific ' diet of the future might consist of a few unappetizing pills . Chemically there are three types of foodstuff that supply us with energy . ( A fourth , ethyl alcohol , contained in wine , has been reckoned to provide Frenchmen and Italians each with an average of about ioo kcal a day , but most nations are less fortunate . ) First there are the carbohydrates , of which the most important are starch ( the main constituent of cereals and potatoes ) , and sugar . In practice , whether most people have enough to eat depends on whether they have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two largely in the form of bread ) supply , in an average year , enough kcal for more than half the population of the world . Barley , maize , oats , and millet are also eaten in large amounts . The second type of foodstuff , protein , provides , weight for weight , roughly as much energy as carbohydrate , but it is much less important for most people as a source of energy . The main sources of animal protein are meat , fish , cheese , and eggs ; milk too is important . Plant protein is eaten mainly in pulses and whole cereals . An adult can do with very little protein indeed , but he can , if necessary , manage on a diet of which almost all the solid is protein : this is what men such as Eskimo , who depend on hunting , have to do . We need , too , very little of the third main type of foodstuff , the fats , provided we have plenty of palatable carbohydrate . Fat , however , provides about twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore a more concentrated form of energy food . Today there still remains a world shortage of fats . Fat shortage can affect us in two important ways : first , it may reduce our intake of the fatsoluble vitamins A and D , which we discuss below ; second , it makes it more difficult to prepare palatable meals . The traditional sources of fat in the West are butter and cheese , and meat , but vegetable fats are becoming more important . They have long been in general // use in , for instance , large parts of India , and in the South of Europe where olive oil is in every kitchen . Carbohydrate , fat and protein are needed , not only as energygivers , but for the growth and maintenance of the body tissues . In this respect protein is of especial importance . It is possible for children to suffer protein deficiency where there is no shortage of energy-producing food . The term protein deficiency ' is , however , imprecise . There are many proteins and each has a different chemical composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , been customary to distinguish second-class ' plant protein from first-class ' animal protein . This is a very crude classification : some animal proteins , notably gelatin , hardly deserve to be called first-class on any scheme ; and the value of plant proteins - which we get mainly from whole wheat , peas , beans , and lentils - depends partly on what other protein is being eaten . There are two important practical points . First , growing children , and pregnant and nursing mothers , have a special need for protein , and so should have first call on proteinous foods of animal origin : milk , meat and fish , cheese and eggs . ( Men doing heavy work have no special , physiological need for protein . They may however be dissatisfied with meatless meals in a country such as England , with a long tradition of a heavy consumption of beef , mutton , and pork or bacon . Moreover , meat contains substances which stimulate appetite , and so increase the amount of food eaten . The justification for extra cheese for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high fat content , a considerable amount of energy in a form easily put into a sandwich . ) Second , if children and mothers throughout the world are to have adequate diets , there must be an enormous increase in milk production . Milk is the most complete of single foods , and is an excellent source of animal protein . The importance of milk is most clear in the large populations of the tropics in which the childhood disease of kwashiorkor is prevalent . This condition usually occurs a few months after weaning , between the ages of one and four years . ( In these communities final weaning from the breast often occurs very late . ) The child is fed mainly on cereals - maize , rice and so on - and receives hardly any protein foods such as meat , fish , eggs or milk . Growth slows down , and the muscles are small and weak . Some-1 1 // times there is excessive fat which may deceive the casual observer . Intellectual development is impaired , and the child is both apathetic and irritable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sparse hair . There is usually poor appetite , and vomiting and diarrhoea occur . Kwashiorkor itself , in many populations , merges into marasmus , in which there is no fat under the skin and in which the child is verging on starvation . Only a small amount of protein is needed to cure kwashiorkor ? at most five grams for every kilogram of body weight of the child daily . This can be obtained from 150 ml ( 5 oz. ) of liquid milk per kilogram body weight . Once appetite has been restored , a mixed diet of solids is given . At this stage plant foods containing plenty of protein are useful . FAT ' Undernourishment and bad diets are the major food problems ; but there is also over-eating . About ten per cent of the body weight of a typical healthy young Europiform man is made up of fat . The corresponding figure for his sister is about twenty-five per cent . In primitive conditions , an extra food reserve for the women is probably useful in preganancy and lactation ; women lead more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the savage state , in which our human ancestors lived for perhaps a million years , the opportunities for putting on much fat are few , and chronic obesity must be almost impossible . In rich countries today , by contrast , middle-aged men probably average around twenty-five per cent fat , and women forty-five per cent . These averages conceal immense variation even among the well fed . Half the total weight of a really gross man may be fat , but only two or three per cent of a very thin one . Moreover , some men and women remain skinny however much they eat , while the girth of others increases inexorably on what seems to them a light diet . Is this important ? Many people , at least in western countries , try to remain slim for the sake of appearance ; this is a matter of fashion . Less often they do so in the interests of athletic fitness . But obesity is also a danger to health . The word overweight ' can be given a precise meaning in terms of the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's to the same extent ) is an important factor // MINERALS ' AND VITAMINS We turn now to other essentials . Bones and teeth are made largely of calcium phosphate , and so calcium and phosphorus are both required . Milk and cheese are excellent sources of both . In Britain today calcium salts are added to the flour from which bread is made . Iron is another chemical element easily identifiable in the body , particularly in the blood : lack of it causes one kind of anaemia . Infants and young women are especially liable to be short of it , and today it is probably the dietary component of which people in rich countries are most likely to be deficient . Meat , fruit , vegetables and whole flour are important sources . Iodine , as we saw in chapter 2 , is also an essential element . Even sodium chloride , the common salt of our tables , is a serious problem in many countries , particularly in the tropics where the heat causes much loss of salt in sweat . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity even in Western Europe . Carbohydrates , fats and proteins , the inorganic salts mentioned in the last paragraph , and water : these are obvious necessities . However , if a diet consisting only of these materials in a pure form is given to animals such as young mice , the animals stop growing , sicken and die . On the other hand , if a small amount of milk is added the animals survive and grow . Milk makes this difference because it contains several further substances essential for life : these , the vitamins , are present , and are needed , only in very small amounts . Look at the table on page 240 . Many large human populations have a high incidence of vitamin deficiency . In some of the densely populated areas of Asia beri-beri is common because the principal food is rice without the husk : this supplies starch without B vitamins , and beri-beri is due mainly to extreme vitamin Bl deficiency ; the heart is affected , there are muscular spasms and weakness , and death results unless suitable food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is xerophthalmia , due to vitamin A deficiency : the eyes are affected , and the disease is a common cause of blindness ; it is often fatal . A third disease , pellagra , has been common in the south of the U.S.A. , especially among the Negroes , and in south-eastern Europe . It is due to lack of another of the B vitamins . The skin becomes scaly and sores develop ; once again , it may be fatal . The two other outstanding deficiency diseases , scurvy ( vitamin C deficiency ) , and rickets ( vitamin D deficiency ) , are more likely to occur in northern climates . Vitamin C is found particularly in oranges and lemons , and in fresh vegetables . Scurvy has in the past been common in Western European towns in late winter . It can be fatal , especially among infants . At one time it was called the London disease ' . England , in spite of its thriving agriculture , has a bad reputation for deficiency conditions . Rickets used to be called the English disease ' ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was widespread among the children of workers in the large towns throughout Britain . Even now , in the 1970s , one may still see in Glasgow , for example , elderly , bow-legged , pigeon-chested men and women , whose skeletons , distorted in childhood , have inevitably remained so throughout life . Today the value of fish liver oils has become generally known , and serious rickets has diminished , though some calcium deficiency is still general among our children . Moreover , in the 1950s and 1960s gross rickets reappeared , notably again in Glasgow . Among its victims were the children of Indian immigrants whose food habits , originating in the tropics , are ill-adapted to the sunless existence of a dark , northern industrial city . Rickets is rare in sunny climates , because vitamin D is formed in the skin by the action of sunlight . Among the other important vitamins , those of the B group , which are water-soluble , occur particularly in whole wheat , whole rice , oatmeal and potatoes , and emphasis has come to be placed rather on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white flour and sugar . This is of especial importance because the amount of B vitamins required varies with the amount of carbohydrate eaten . As for the fat-soluble vitamins , vitamin A ( or a substance that becomes vitamin A in the body ) is fairly easily obtained from green vegetables and from carrots , although this has not prevented a good deal of mild vitamin A deficiency among the poor in England and elsewhere . Both A and D are found in liver , the fat of meat , fat fish such as herrings , and eggs and butter . They are also now added in small quantities to margarine in the United Kingdom . WHAT PEOPLE EAT For the whole world , the primary food problem is one of quantity , not quality . The problem is not new . The novelty is in the fact that , for the first time in history , it can be defined and action can be taken to solve it . In the 19305 Europe , with a population just over one-third that of Asia , consumed more cereals and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people in Asia . This is a measure of the inadequacy of the food available to more than half the world 's population . In dairy products the disparity was , no doubt , even greater . The people in Central America and large parts of South // America and Africa were similarly short of food . This situation has not changed substantially . After the Second World War there was famine in Bengal , in which vast numbers of people died of starvation . In 1968 there was famine in Bihar . Even where there is enough food such as rice , there is a high incidence of vitamin deficiency diseases . The complaint used to be made by Europeans that natives ' in Asian and African countries were idle and bad workers . But nobody can work hard if they are chronically underfed . ( Nor , as we shall see in the next chapter , can they do so if they are chronically infected . ) In the words of a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization : The whole manner of life is adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially undesirable : lack of drive and initiative ; avoidance of physical and mental effort ; excessive rest . ' The richer countries of the west might be thought to have no difficulty in getting enough good food . But even in Britain and the United States this was and is far from true . Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the problem in England was to produce enough food . Most people grew their own , and if the harvest was good all was well . This had been the position for centuries among the peasantry . Chaucer 's widow in the Nonnes Preestes Tale did not have much variety : No winne dranke she , neyther white ne red : Hire bord was served most with white and black . Milk and broun bread , in which she found no lack , Seinde bacon , and sometime an ey or twey . But a diet based on milk , rye or wholemeal bread , bacon , and eggs is not likely to lead to serious deficiency , except perhaps of vitamin C. Little sugar was eaten , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer . The only serious hazard was famine . Industrialism led to a great change . The industrialists wanted cheap food for the working people in the towns , since without it they could not get hands for the factories . The landowners , on whose estates food was produced , wanted food prices kept up . At the beginning of the nineteenth century there was a duty on imported wheat , and the 4-lb. loaf cost fourteen pence . Wages were one or two shillings a day . In 1846 the factory workers and industrialists achieved the repeal of the Corn Laws : the import duty came off , // and by 1900 the 4-lb. loaf cost sixpence . During the nineteenth century the population of England and Wales doubled , and from being agricultural became predominantly urban and industrial , living largely on cheap imported cereal foods , sugar , and potatoes . Wheat was eaten mainly as white flour , and the annual consumption of sugar rose from a few pounds per head to nearly one hundredweight . Agriculture declined , and the consumption of dairy products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scurvy became common . At the beginning of the century the minimum recruiting height for the army was five feet six inches ; by the end it had to be reduced to five feet . The high proportion of recruits rejected as unfit for service in the Boer War eventually led to the introduction of school meals . When will they notice us ? When will they flatter us ? When will they help us ? When there 's a war ! Then they will ask for our children and kill them : sympathise deeply and ask for some more . But it was not until the 19305 that it became possible , by investigation of the diets of large numbers of families , to determine the extent and character of the still prevailing malnutrition . Admittedly , standards vary , and there is even now no agreement on the necessary amounts of certain essentials : nobody can do without vitamin C , for instance , but we can not lay down precisely , with reasonable certainty , the minimum any person , or even any class of persons , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to see the effects of gross deficiencies , but far from easy to relate less obvious symptoms , such as an apparently excessive susceptibility to some infections , to shortage of a particular vitamin . One difficulty is that individuals almost certainly vary genetically in their vitamin needs . Tooth decay is unquestionably influenced by diet ; but one child may have excellent teeth , while another on the same diet may have extensive decay . And complexities do not end there . In one investigation it was found impossible to induce certain volunteers to show signs of vitamin B1 deficiency : although deprived of the vitamin they continued to excrete it in their urine , as if they were synthesizing it in their bodies . A drug was then given to kill most of the bacteria in their intestines . ( Our intestines always contain harmless bacteria . ) The excretion of Bl at once stopped ; it // was the bacteria which had been producing it . Hence our liability to vitamin Bl deficiency depends in part on the bacteria we harbour . Despite these difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the Second World War illustrate the state of nutrition attained in a period of relative stability . The effect of poverty was clearly shown in Orr 's famous report , Food , Health and Income , published in 1935 . The diagram above is based on it . The food of at least half of the population of England and Wales was seriously deficient . The malnourished fifty per cent belonged to the poor , and since the poor had , on the average , larger families than the rich , about seventy-five per cent of the children of England and Wales were inadequately fed . Later surveys confirmed Orr 's findings . Within each income group there is wide variation from the average : some individuals or families do much better , and others correspondingly worse . But this does not 4 invalidate the conclusions drawn from the surveys . Orr 's results , and those of later workers , show what , in fact , people do eat . If every housewife were a skilled dietician , had unlimited time and patience , access to the cheapest markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless be better . This , however , is academic , except that it suggests the need // for a long-term policy of education and of improvement in kitchen equipment . But the malnutrition of the poor can not be attributed to ignorance ; Orr 's figures show that , even with the maximum of knowledge and skill , twenty per cent of the population , with then existing wages and prices , could not have afforded a satisfactory diet . His comment was as follows : It has been suggested that the standard adopted , namely what is needed to enable people to attain their inherited capacity for health and physical fitness , is so high that it is impracticable . One writer terms it utopian ' . In animal husbandry , an optimum standard , far from being utopian , is regarded as good practice . Every intelligent stock farmer in rearing animals tries to get a minimum diet for maximum health and physical fitness . A suggestion that he should use a lower standard would be regarded as absurd . If children of the three lower groups were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet below the requirements for health would be financially unsound . Unfortunately , the health and physical fitness of the rising generation are not marketable commodities which can be assessed in terms of money . The position in the United States , the wealthiest country of all , was probably slightly better than that of England . But it was not good . The United States Department of Agriculture Yearbook for 1939 contains the following passage : If the total quantities of food produced in this country were distributed in proportion to need , a fairly satisfactory diet would be provided for every individual . As it is , the national dietary level appears high because of the high consumption of certain foods by some families . Urban families with limited funds for food and rural families with limited opportunities for home production tend to lay emphasis on the kind of foods that satisfy obvious hunger cheaply and to neglect those that satisfy also the hidden nutritional hunger ' ? for vitamins and minerals ? described by science . To raise consumption of all groups to the level of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of milk by twenty per cent , of butter by fifteen , tomatoes and citrus fruits seventy , leafy and yellow vegetables one hundred , and eggs thirtyfive per cent . The similarity to England holds too in the relationship between poverty and malnutrition . In 1936 about thirty-two 1 // per cent of families and single individuals in the U.S. had incomes under 750 dollars a year , and none of these could afford satisfactory diets at the prices then prevailing . Extensive studies made since the Second World War show that malnutrition and even deficiency diseases remain common . Children and pregnant women suffer most . Reports of widespread malnutrition in advanced countries were at first received with a good deal of scepticism , but they were confirmed by the effects of improving diets . These are most clearly seen in children and in women before and after childbirth . In a study of an English village colony for boys , some of the boys were allowed an extra ration of milk each day , while others remained on the usual diet . The average annual gain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that of the boys receiving the normal diet , 3.83 lb . Other experiments have had similar results in both Britain and the U.S.A. These observations are paralleled in both countries by two well established facts : that the children of the poor are smaller , weaker , and suffer more disease than those of the rich ; and that there has been a steady improvement during the twentieth century in all classes . The clearest index of improvement is the increase in average weight and height of children of all ages . This has been accompanied by progressively earlier achievement of maturity . In Europe , U.S.S.R. , North America , Japan and elsewhere , during this century , the average age of girls at first menstruation ( the menarche ) has declined : around 1900 , in some populations , it was about seventeen years , while by mid-century it was thirteen . Another index of maturity is the age at which growth stops . During recent decades , in advanced countries , not only has average stature gone up , but also ? more recently ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in bad conditions , as in the slums of big cities , they may go on growing to the age of twenty or more ; in better conditions , growth may cease at sixteen . The improvement is probably not due only to better nutrition . Infectious disease has been much reduced , and this is only partly due to better food and consequent higher resistence . Smaller families and child-welfare clinics have both led to better care of children . Nevertheless , food has certainly played a major part . In Britain even during the Second World War the improvement conFOOD // tinued . This was probably a result of three things : the rationing of most important foods , controlled prices , and full employment ( which abolished most of the worst poverty ) . Growth in height and weight is generally used in assessing physical condition . This is primarily because both height and weight can be measured accurately and quickly . But it is further justified by the fact that other qualities vary with physical growth . Children who grow most rapidly have , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of school activity , both physical and intellectual . This does not signify that small people are inferior , but only that , on the whole , growth in the ordinary sense goes with the growth of intellect and ability . For the effect of diet on pregnant women the simplest criteria to use are the proportions of deaths in childbirth , stillbirths , and deaths of the children in the first month of life . In South Wales in 1934 , when there was much unemployment among the miners , over 27,000 women were studied , some of whom were given extra food . Here are figures obtained in one year : The extra food included a small amount of protein , together with calcium , phosphorus , vitamin A , and B vitamins . This supplement , although it markedly influenced death rates , still left the total diet of the women far below any recommended standard . Many of these figures may seem to have only an historical interest ; but even in the rich countries not everyone yet has enough good food . In Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Second World War ; and in the 1960s the situation worsened in certain ways . As usual there was a marked effect of poverty : the lower the family income , and the larger the family , the slower ( on the average ) was the growth of the children in it . This is almost certainly due largely to differences in nutrition between the economic classes . In 1964 severe rickets was reported in the Glasgow slums . But not all the bad feeding of children is due to poverty , for surveys of the buying habits of parents have revealed // a new factor . Commodities such as biscuits , of low nutritional value , are so skilfully advertised on television that they are excessively eaten . Equally ingenious advertising of products ( useful in themselves ) which contain vitamin C has evidently misled some conscientious mothers into believing that this is the only vitamin their children need . Most of the world 's population is nutritionally in a far more precarious state than the city poor of western countries . A very rough classification divides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas are North America , Europe , the U.S.S.R. , Australasia and Japan . Second is China , which is in a process of rapid change from profound poverty . Third come the two thousand million poor of Asia , Africa and Latin America . This majority of mankind has so far received virtually no benefit from modern science or technology . A peon in South America , a villager in India or a herdsman or farmer in Africa lives much the same life as that of a peasant of four thousand years ago ? all too often nasty , brutish , and short ' . A small minority of landlords and merchants are wealthy and accordingly resist proposals for change . Moreover , the gap between the rich and poor nations is widening . In the rich world , in the 1960s , in each year there has been an increase in wealth per head of more than three per cent ; in the poor world the figure was less than half that . Yet of course it is the poor nations which most need a rapid increase . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unremitting growth of populations . But the population of the U.S.A. is increasing at a rate similar to that of India ; and , although there is a large minority of very poor people in the United States , on the whole Americans are still becoming richer . The crucial need in the poor countries is implied in the commonly used adjective , underdeveloped ' : industry must be vastly increased in parallel with improvements in food production . The experience of the U.S.S.R. since 1918 has illustrated both the possibilities and the hazards of such a programme . In the second half of the twentieth century the pacemaker for the poor world is China . The seven hundred million people in China are increasing , probably , at a rate of at least fourteen million a year . By the end of the century there may be twelve hundred million Chinese . To cope with this situation agricultural improvement is proceeding on an unprecedented scale . Freedom from starvation depends still on rice , // and rice growing has been extended from its original area south of the Hwai River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been similarly enlarged . The change in the face of the Chinese earth depends on the control of floods , irrigation and a revolution in land management . There are no longer landlords taking a large and regular percentage of the peasants ' crops . Instead , the farms are grouped in co-operatives ; and these in turn are organized in communes which have an average membership of about twenty thousand people . These large units allow the economic use of modern methods and equipment . The peasants retain private plots of land on which they produce food for their families . At the same time , the Chinese are contriving to train geologists , agricultural experts and others , and are consequently beginning to make use of the enormous resources in metals , oil and other minerals , of which the existence was hardly suspected until the middle of this century . Consequently , China is rapidly becoming a major industrial nation . Today , in the west , the usual notion of China among people who read the newspapers is a political one . But in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Eventually , they will be copied elsewhere ; and indeed , they are being copied now , though not yet very successfully as a rule . The bitter struggle entailed in wrenching a nation of peasants into the twentieth century can be much relieved if help is given by the rich countries . The average income in Western Europe is something like ten times that of an Indian , African or South American peasant . The rich , in fact , could spare a good deal and yet suffer no more than a temporary slowing of their increase in wealth . The poor countries need knowledge and equipment . There are international bodies , such as the Food and Agriculture Organization , through which they could be efficiently supplied . Throughout the advanced countries there is immense goodwill and an increasing feeling of responsibility towards even remote countries which need help . A major task for the rest of this century is to make this feeling effective . LIFE AND DEATH Death be not proud , though some have called thee Mighty and dreadfull ; for , thou art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great causes of premature death have been famine and infectious disease . The casualties due directly to war have been trifling by comparison , at least until the middle of the twentieth century . Among the twentieth-century objectives of applied science , the conquest of infection remains second only to feeding people . What has already been accomplished represents one of humanity 's major achievements . The problem arises from the crowded populations of civilization . Primitive peoples untouched by advanced cultures seem to have few serious epidemics or endemic infections , though individuals rarely reach more than middle age . This is inferred from the study of their skeletons , and from the reports of the civilized men who first reached them . Regular contact with advanced communities is followed by a complete change : primitive groups not before exposed to the disease germs of civilization are highly susceptible ; the first experience they have of them is often a sudden , heavy infection : there is little possibility of getting a mild or undetectable attack from a light infection , such as often occurs in other communities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance to these diseases , they are probably genetically more susceptible than larger communities . The inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego , in less than a century , were reduced from about 6o,000 to 200 , largely through infection with smallpox , measles and tuberculosis . The Pacific islands were similarly depopulated of their attractive inhabitants , after the European invasion . These three diseases are mainly airborne , and so depend for their spread directly on the crowding of people together . But the density of civilized populations also gives opportunities for other 250 // noxious organisms . Water supplies may be infected ; sewage and other household waste may harbour the germs of disease or the animals that carry them ; food itself , in its journey from the farm to the consumer , may become infected , and is liable , like waste , to maintain populations of germ-bearing pests such as flies and rats , as well as the human population for which it is intended . THE SANITARY IDEA ' None of this was properly understood anywhere until the middle of the nineteenth century , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between disease and filth had long been suspected , the connexion was not proved . Foul airs ' or miasmas were believed to be the agents of disease , and the name of malaria ( bad air ) remains a memorial to this view . Microscopists had demonstrated the presence of bacteria and other microbes in a variety of places , including decaying material , but these organisms were believed to grow directly from the stuff they lived on . The foundation of bacteriology was the demonstration that microbes do not appear spontaneously ' in any medium , however suitable for their growth : they appear only if the medium has been exposed to infection from elsewhere : microbes , like larger organisms , grow only from other , similar bodies . Thus it came to be realized that filth caused disease on account of microbes which grow in it and which can also live in men 's bodies . Infection from these sources is far from being the cause of all disease . ( In the last chapter we had examples of deficiency diseases which are in no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal conditions which are fixed genetically . ) But many of the worst killers of children and of men and women in their prime turned out to be infections preventible by sanitary measures . The need for these measures had never been so great as in the new industrial towns of the nineteenth century . The squalor and degradation of the working population in English towns is fully described in a series of official reports published during the 1840s . Edwin Chadwick ( 1800-1890 ) , the inventor of the expression the sanitary idea ' , wrote : // Such is the absence of civic economy in some of our towns that their condition in respect to cleanliness is almost as bad as that of an encamped horde , or an undisciplined soldiery . He describes army standing orders for camp sanitation , and goes on : The towns whose populations never change their encampment have no such care , and whilst the houses , streets , courts , lanes , and streams are polluted and rendered pestilential , the civic officers have generally contented themselves with the most barbarous expedients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignation of Turkish fatalists , under the supposed destiny of the prevalent ignorance , sloth and filth . Similarly the Frenchman , J. Blanqui , describes how in 1849 , in the industrial town of Lille , 3000 families lived in unventilated , insanitary cellars . Conditions like these are still the fate of many millions in , for instance , India and the poor countries of South America . Improvement required the setting up of a national public health organization in each country , and effective public health departments for each local government authority . This was a big task , both administratively and technically . Engineers , sanitary inspectors , dustmen and sewermen , as well as doctors , had to be recruited , trained , and paid . It is only recently that , even in Britain , all houses in towns have had a reliable piped water supply free from infection ; ( the poorer houses often have even now only one tap , and in the country much water still comes from wells , some quite shallow and easily infected ) ; but today most urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking , washing , and cleaning , but also a bacteriological service to keep watch on the quality of the water supplied . A necessary complement to a good water supply is an efficient system of drains and sewers . In 1840 household waste of all kinds was put in cesspools ( Windsor Castle had 250 of them ) , or human excrement was collected in heaps for sale as manure ; refuse collection was unorganized and sporadic , where it existed at all . The new working-class houses whose occupiers suffered these conditions were flimsy , airless , ill-lit , and commonly built in terraces backto-back , with only a narrow alley in front . Some of these houses are still lived in. // Although the first attempts to improve the hygiene of cities were made even before the elements of bacteriology were understood , the squalor remained almost untouched for most of the century ; the efforts of the wealthy taxpayers who did not wish to spend money on the poor , of the water companies , of some sections of the medical profession and of other vested interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first decade of the twentieth century the application of the sanitary idea had wrought a vast change in mortality and morbidity from some major diseases , not only in Britain but also in the main countries of western Europe , and in the United States . The extent and limits of this advance can be shown if we consider the main epidemic diseases of human populations . PESTILENCE Throughout the world the worst water-borne diseases are cholera , typhoid and various forms of dysentery . Today cholera is called a tropical disease ' , but there were four major outbreaks in western Europe during the nineteenth century . Epidemics are nearly always due to infection of drinking water ; in 1824 a single infected well near Piccadilly Circus , in London , caused 485 deaths in ten days . Cholera is no longer a disease of western Europe , but when this book was first written a serious epidemic was reported in Egypt , and it is continually present in India , especially Bengal . Much the same applies to typhoid fever , or more generally to the enteric fevers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so completely disappeared from the western world . One of the most notorious epidemics was in Plymouth , Pennsylvania , in 1885 . About 1200 persons in a population of 8000 had typhoid in the spring of that year , and one in ten died . During the winter a man living near a stream that flowed into the town 's reservoir had had typhoid , and each night his wife had thrown his excreta on to the frozen ground . When the thaw came in the spring the accumulation was washed into the brook and infected the reservoir . The last serious epidemic in England , at Croydon in 1937 , was similarly traced to the individual who was the source of the infection . He was one of a party of men working on an unchlorinated well , who had been in the habit of urinating nearby ; the man had // had typhoid and was a carrier . There were 311 cases , with 42 deaths . A century earlier such an incident would have attracted little attention , but in 1937 it aroused great public interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry . In this case the public health organization had failed at two points : the well had been unchlorinated , and a healthy typhoid carrier had not been detected by bacteriological tests and prevented from working where he might infect the water supply . The last important outbreak in Britain was in Aberdeen , and was due to infected food . It , too , was due to a series of failures . The source was a can of corned beef . These cans are cooled in river water . The water usually contains large amounts of sewage , and can infect meat if there are minute flaws in the tins . Hence , in the 1950s , Argentinian producers began to chlorinate the cooling water . On 31 December 1962 a chlorinating plant broke down . It was not repaired for more than a year , but the factory concerned continued to can beef , since to stop would have entailed financial loss . A British government inspector discovered this situation in January 1964 , and cabled London accordingly , but the Ministries concerned took no action . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By July , when the outbreak ended , there had been over 400 cases of typhoid ; but this time , owing to the use of antibiotic drugs , there were no deaths due solely to the infection . Hence the diseases carried by water may also be food-borne . And food can be a source of other infections as well . There are several forms of food-poisoning ' caused by bacteria or other organisms , and gastro-enteritis is a general term for the resulting conditions . They are especially serious in infants and young babies . Cleanliness in the handling and preparation of food at all stages ; preventing infected persons from working in food establishments ; and the use of effective preserving methods for canned and bottled foods : these are the principal preventive measures . In general , food-borne disease is less likely to cause epidemics on a large scale than is disease carried by water . Milk , however , occupies a special place among foods : it is distributed in bulk to very large numbers of people in towns , and it is as good a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infected milk can cause epidemics of typhoid , dysentery , tonsilitis , Qfever , and undulant fever . It is also the source of one type of tuberculosis . The heat treatment of milk , which is now compulsory in some communities , can prevent the transmission of all these infections . The name of the process , pasteurization , is a memorial to Louis Pasteur ( 1822-95 ) , who did more than any other man to found the germ theory of disease . Food may be infected , not only by man himself , but by various animals : flies provide the most familiar example , and are still a menace in the western world as carriers of germs of enteritis and // food poisoning . However , the discovery of specific insecticides , of which DDT is the best known , promises the elimination of flies in communities in which they are used on a large enough scale . But fleas , lice and mosquitoes take pride of place among animal carriers of disease . All these infect man directly and not through food or water . Rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle Ages . The plague bacillus is primarily a parasite in the bodies of various species of wild mammals , from ground squirrels in central Asia to rabbits in California . In these animals it causes little harm , and it certainly does not give rise to epidemics with a high mortality . It is transmitted from one individual to another by fleas , and rats become infected in the same way . Rat populations too may maintain a comparatively mild plague infection . Human infection occurs ? though not invariably ? where there are many infected rats , and the rats have many fleas . These conditions hold today in large parts of India and have held until very recently in China ; and there are plague reservoirs also in North and South Africa , and in North America . In India , where there are vast populations of rats closely associated with man , plague is a continual source of anxiety even when there are no human outbreaks . Today , in the 1970s , there is concern because a species of rodent , the bandicoot rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several major centres of population , such as Calcutta . Hence an outbreak is possible at any time . Nor are the most advanced countries free : there are large populations of plague-infected rodents in California ; and there have recently been cases of plague in San Francisco . However , present dangers are probably not comparable to those of the past . We know for certain of three world outbreaks , or pandemics , of plague , though others probably occurred before them . A pandemic begins suddenly , and spreads over a large area , such as Europe , within a few years ; initially the proportion of people dangerously infected is high ? perhaps ten per cent . Death rates vary with the exact character of the disease . In the common form , bubonic plague , lymph nodes ( glands ' ) in the groin , the armpit or , occasionally , the neck become swollen and form a bubo . The death rate may then be only fifty per cent , even without modern treatment . The highest mortality ? usually one hundred per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pneumonic plague : the lungs are involved and bacilli are coughed into the air . For a century or more after the first outbreak plague continues intermittently and with diminishing intensity . Finally in large areas it disappears completely . We can not explain this sequence . The first fully authenticated pandemic , the plague of Justinian ' , began in the sixth century , and we have no detailed knowledge of what happened . The second was the Black Death which began in the fourteenth century , and reached France and England in 1349 . The initial mortality , though high , was probably less disastrous than the steady drain of lives and health that followed during the next hundred years . This was a period of falling population and collapsing economy in western Europe , and plague made a major contribution to that state of affairs . The last flare-up of the Black Death in England was the great plague of London ' of 1664 . The third pandemic is still going on as this book is written . It began in China , probably in the 1870s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main ports of Africa and Asia Minor . Europe largely escaped . England had a few cases during the period 1910-21 , when rodents in an area of East Anglia were infected . Plague is far from being a simple problem of public health , and we can not attribute Europe 's escape simply to improved hygiene and precautions against rats at the ports , though they doubtless played some part . With our present knowledge the remedy for plague is prevention by killing rats and their fleas , and by reducing filth that encourages them ; protection can also be given by inoculation . We have still to get full understanding of the complex relationships between the plague-ridden rodent populations , their fleas and ourselves . While plague is a problem of the rats that live in our houses , and of public cleanliness , epidemic typhus fever is a problem of the lice that live on our bodies and of personal cleanliness . This , the worst form of typhus , has destroyed armies and altered the course of wars . The great outbreaks occur when unwashed people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to another . In earlier times alternative names for typhus were jail fever and hospital fever . The habit of washing which has become so widespread in the western world in modern times has made perhaps a contribution to disease prevention comparable with the control of the water // supply . A Lancashire miner , in 1842 , was asked how often the coaldrawers washed their bodies . He is reported to have replied : None of the drawers ever wash their bodies . I never wash my body ; I let my shirt rub the dirt off . I wash my neck and ears and face , of course . Even more to the point is the cheerful mention in the diary of Samuel Pepys ( 1633-1703 ) , a First Lord of the Admiralty , of the presence of twenty lice in his hair one evening ? more than I have had this many a long day . And so with great content to bed ' . The diseases so far discussed are often called tropical ' by medical men in temperate lands , because they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections have a more permanent right to the name , since they are almost confined to the tropics and sub-tropics . Malaria can occur as far north as Archangel , and one form of it turned up regularly in the London hospitals and even in the south of Scotland as recently as the 1860s ; but ague , as it was called , was never such a menace in the north as it has been , and still is , in hotter climates . In large parts of the most densely populated countries malaria is almost universal , and it is the world 's leading infectious illness and cause of death . A conservative estimate of its total incidence suggests that a quarter of the world 's population suffered from it until at least the second half of the twentieth century . In India the number of people treated for malaria each year is of the order of ten million , but this is only a small proportion of the total infected . Malaria differs from the acute infections ( such as plague and typhus ) in being , very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few days or weeks , or subsides ; a chronic infection may persist for years , perhaps for a lifetime . People with chronic malaria are weak and lethargic , as well as subject to fever every few days ; and uninformed and uninfected Europeans , seeing them , have been led to believe that all natives ' are naturally lazy . We have seen that the effects of chronic undernutrition may encourage them in this mistaken view . The principal means of preventing endemic malaria is destruction of mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles . This is a formidable task requiring a large organization of trained persons . Methods include the draining of marshes and streams , where the mosquitoes breed ; poison in the water ; and the introduction of plants or fish that // prevent breeding . What is done depends partly on the species of Anopheles . Mosquito teams applying these methods have already had considerable success in countries as diverse as India , Italy , Panama , and Brazil . In Central and South America , and in West Africa , they are called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries yellow fever , or vomito negro ? the black vomit . This terrifying disease has been known only since 1648 . It was common along the coasts of the Americas and of West Africa . One of the best recorded outbreaks occurred in Philadelphia in 1793 , and killed 4000 out of a population of 50,000 . Many fled the city . The doctors advised the burning of gunpowder and the smoking of tobacco as preventives . The cause , a mosquito-borne virus , was established at the beginning of this century . It was the destruction both of Anopheles and Aedes that finally made possible the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914 . Today , epidemic yellow fever has been eliminated , but endemic yellow fever remains ; like plague , it depends on a complex set of animal vectors , including mosquitoes ( not Ades ) and various species of monkey . As such , both in tropical Africa and in South America , it is still a potential threat . However , immunization is possible , and is compulsory under international law for travellers in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some places have been prevented , by applying a rather wide interpretation of the sanitary idea . They represent the easiest targets for public health authorities . This is because they depend on other animals besides ourselves , whereas most infectious diseases are carried from man to man . This is the case with the group of air-borne infections , which are ? in principle at least ? a more difficult problem . The worst of them , smallpox , however , had been shown , by an astonishing feat of empirical medicine , to be preventible more than half a century before the germ theory of disease was established ; the technique of vaccination was invented before the end of the eighteenth century . At that period few people in Europe escaped having smallpox at some time in their lives , and about one in twelve of infected persons died . Most survivors were disfigured for life by the pockmarks , and some were blinded . Today deaths from smallpox are rare in the West , partly as a result of vaccination .
