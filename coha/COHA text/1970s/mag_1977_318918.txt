HOW TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE <P> by ERICA JONG <P> 310 pages . Holt , Rinehart and Winston . $8.95 . <P> Erica Jong writes not so much novels as almost breathlessly up-to-date confessional bulletins . When last seen in Fear of Flying , Jong ( who calls herself Isadora Wing on paper ) was soaping up in her psychiatrist-husband 's bathtub , waiting rather ambiguously for him to return and forgive her for the 340-page sexual excursion that made up the novel . <P> It did n't work out . At the start of How to Save Your Own Life , Erica/Isadora is slipping out of the Wing/Jong Upper West Side co-op apartment for the last time , leaving the doctor to his patients and as Isadora says , " his hatred of women . " Writes the heroine : " I was on the lam , an exile from a bad marriage , a wandering Jewess ; a lifelong New Yorker heading Wes ... I was off to meet a lover and my destiny . " In Jong 's wall-poster philosophy , today is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fear of Flying possessed a bawdy exuberance . John Updike even found it Chaucerian . But How to Save Your Own Life is marinated in sour juices : dissolving marriage , curdled fame , Hollywood 's treachery . " Ai n't it awful ? " the reader mutters . Erica/Isadora uses the book to settle old scores against her husband ( " I married a monster , I think " ) and a hustling Hollywood producer who , she says , flimflammed her on the film rights to the bestselling first novel . Before she gets around to making the final break with Dr. Wing , Isadora has a lesbian affair , checks in with a brace of former lovers ( male ) , flies West to work on her film , and there finds the vacant , curiously dippy Josh , a 27-year-old aspiring screenwriter who is to be the love of her life . For now , anyway , Isadora composes lines to him that read like hard-core Kahlil Gibran : " My soul is mine ; / My mouth belongs to you .

The author 's mind seems to have been softened by too many hours in a Malibu Jacuzzi . As if searching for a new definition of vulgarity , Jong writes that hostile criticism of her first novel makes her think of " Jews gassed at Auschwitz . " ( Actually , Fear of Flying was extravagantly overpraised . ) She also contrives to turn the tragic suicide of Poet Anne Sexton ( named " Jeannie " in the book ) into a kind of posthumous blurb for herself . <P> The woman is enough to make readers think that sex really is dirty . She describes remarkably unpleasant oral activities with her female lover ; if a man had written that , feminists would have beaten him unconscious with a copy of The Hite Report . The heroine is forever masturbating . Sex is often joyless or , when it is good , it sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . dripping . . . throbbing .
