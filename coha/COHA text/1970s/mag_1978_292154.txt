After ten years , it is still dangerously radioactive <P> A decade ago , when the U.S. finally agreed to let some 500 Micronesians return to their native island of Bikini , Washington officials determined to undo the damage inflicted by 23 nuclear tests . All sorts of debris was scooped off the beaches and dumped out at sea . Swaths of local jungle were cleared so that some 50,000 new coconut trees could be planted . Forty cement houses were built along the shore of the lagoon , and an Atomic Energy Commission spokesman declared that there was " virtually no radiation left . " After a generation of exile , the first 100 of the Bikini islanders contentedly settled down in their new homes , at peace at last . <P> Last week , in confirming an embarrassing blunder , U.S. officials acknowledged that their assessment of Bikini was premature . Periodic radiological surveys conducted by the Government since 1975 showed that the earlier tests had been inadequate . Bikini 's well water still contains strontium 90 and cesium 137 , radioactive products of the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables grown on the island . <P> The U.S. Interior Department , which has supervisory authority over the island as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands , insisted that none of the people on Bikini had shown any adverse effects from radiation during periodic health checks . But officials found that levels of strontium and cesium , as well as of plutonium , were rising alarmingly among the returned islanders , and they now believe that Bikini probably will not be safe for long-term human occupation for another 35 to 50 years . " It is now clear , " as the department put it , " that for the foreseeable future the island of Bikini should not be used for agricultural purposes and should not be considered a residential area . " Those islanders who have been repatriated will have to be evacuated again . In the meantime , they have been forbidden to eat their home-grown coconuts , bananas and breadfruit . Food is now being shipped in from outside . <P> A likely resettlement site is the island of Eneu , also a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of nuclear testing to be safe for people . In fact , the Interior Department is already asking Congress to allocate $6 million as the first payment in a resettlement program ultimately expected to cost $15 million . <P> Still , before any further decision is made on a new home for the Bikinians , the department will conduct its long-promised aerial radiation survey of all the areas in the Marshall Islands where nuclear devices were exploded , in order to determine which of the now peaceful islands are once again fit-truly-for human inhabitants .
