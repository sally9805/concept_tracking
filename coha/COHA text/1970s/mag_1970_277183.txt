THE age of electronics may be making a profound impression on the U.S. political scene , but TV has not quite replaced the old whistle-stop grass-roots approach to the voters . For this week 's cover story on the struggle for control of the U.S. Senate in next month 's elections , TIME correspondents in most domestic bureaus trailed the candidates in their quest for victory . " It 's government coming to the people in a rough , rugged man-to-man manner that television has n't succeeded in killing yet , " says Senior Correspondent John Steele . <P> Chronicling the travels and travails of Texas ' George Bush , Correspondent Leo Janos reports that one afternoon they landed at a private airport in Fort Worth only to find the place deserted . " Well , what does TIME think of this warm and friendly reception ? " Bush asked . " Positively Humphreyish , " replied Janos . " No , " grinned the candidate . " Bush-league . " <P> Trailing Vice President Agnew and his small army of security agents , John Stacks noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' vice-presidential credentials and locked them out of the hall . Local police tended to reject all credentials- " except , " says Stacks , " a ticket to whatever $100-a-plate function was taking place . " <P> From Washington , Neil MacNeil , whose book Dirksen : Portrait of a Public Man is being published this week by World ( $12.50 ) , filed voluminous reports on the Senate 's historical relationship to the President . The cover story itself was written by Correspondent Hays Gorey ; it was edited by Jason McManus and researched by Anne Constable . <P> <P> The Cover : Cartoon in watercolor with ink , by Mort Drucker , a longtime contributor to Mad magazine .

In New York , wearing Spiro 's livery , James Buckley ( 3 ) joins Richard Ottinger ( 4 ) in assailing Charles Goodell ( 5 ) , who already feels the weight of Sir Spiro 's spiked mace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio ( 6 ) is threatened by the ax of Robert Taft Jr . ( 7 ) , while in Tennessee , Albert Gore ( 8 ) aims a mighty swipe at William Brock ( 9 ) . In Florida , Lawton Chiles ( 10 ) closes with William Cramer ( 11 ) , toe-deep in the Gulf of Mexico . And across the water in Texas , Lloyd Bentsen ( 12 ) raises his shield against George Bush ( 13 ) . Finally , out on the Coast , John Tunney ( 14 ) wields a boxing glove bludgeon against dancing George Murphy ( 15 ) .
