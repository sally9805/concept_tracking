txt In 1641 , the galleon Concepcion smashed into a coral reef 85 miles northeast of what is now the Dominican Republic and sank with a huge store of silver and gold in her hold . In late 1978 , a Pennsylvanian of little means named Burt B. Webber Jr . found the ship . It was a major discovery , according to historians . The Dominican authorities , after inspecting pieces of eight and other precious items brought up by Mr. Webber 's search team , confirmed the discovery . Mr. Webber then returned to his duplex on North Chestnut Street here for a quiet holiday with his family before going to New York to announce his find . No Speculation on Value " It is quite an accomplishment in the field of treasure hunting , " said Dr. Eugene Lyon , a Spanish and Latin-American historian in Vero Beach , Fla. , who is a consultant with the National Geographic Society . " It was one of the major losses in the 17th century . I 'd say it would be quite a feather in anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars , Dr. Lyon declined to speculate on the value . " These things are so iffy , " he said . " Until all the material is salvaged and sold , it 's awfully difficult to tell what it might bring . " Nor would Mr. Webber speak much about wealth . lie spent the holiday in the company of relatives who thought it not only unnecessary , but absolutely ridiculous , to wish him a happy New Year . In the evening , he was moved only to say , " Like a dream come true . " Mr. Webber 's wife of 15 years , Sandy , the mother of their four children , rolled a particularly savory thought around in her head . " I was at the card club-when my son called , " she said . " I thought something was wrong with the house . He said , ' Daddy found the wreck . ' " It is the stuff of legend . Mr. Webber is a 36-year-old man who lives in a town where the only noticeable spark in life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he was 16 he took up scuba diving , an avocation nearly unheard of in landlocked Lebanon County . He explored stone quarries and read books about sunken treasure . He read " Treasure Island , " too . From age 20 on , he hired out with this expedition or that , and they all came to naught . " One fiasco after another , " Mr. Webber said . The people in town , he said , would say , " Burt 's off on another expedition . We 've heard this story before . " In between . expeditions , Mr. Webber supported his family by working in a brick plant , selling encyclopedias , welding and other prosaic tasks . He would be home one-third of the year and away the rest . Gradually , his fantasies about sunken treasure dovetailed into what he came to think of as a pragmatic business venture . With the help of an investment broker in Chicago , Mr. Webber formed Sea Quest International . Backers were secured in several major cities . A historian was engaged for meticulous research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first royal governor of Massachusetts , found part of the wreck in 1687 and salvaged 32 tons of silver . But that was all that the technology of the time would allow him to get at , and for centuries it has been thought that the ocean held back more than it gave that expedition . In 1977 , Mr. Webber obtained a 65-foot vessel and a nine-man crew . Working out // The New York Times/Jam 3 , 1979 X marks the spot where treasure - hunterslound the galleon. of Puerto . Plata , he systematically surveyed a 16-mile-long reef made up of hundreds of coral heads and forming part of the 42-mile-long Silver Shoals , where the wreck was thought to be . He searched for five months without success . Last November , he secured a 113-foot former British minesweeper and a 16-man crew and returned for a second look . On Nov. 28 , he got into the water with a supersensitive , hand-held cesium magnometer . A series of lights on a console in the magnometer 's housing changes hues , and the vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intensifies when he finds , in the wonderfully apt word of the treasure hunter , " anomalies . " " I swam around one of these coral heads and into the next grid survey we had buoyed out , " Mr. Webber said , " and there it was . The magnometer started to produce magnetic anomalies as I swam in and out of the canyons . " Pieces of eight minted in 1638 , 1639 and 1640 were found , and also porcelains from China shipped into Acapulco , trekked overland to Vera Cruz and put aboard the Concepci6n for shipment to the Spanish crown . The salvage job , which Mr. Webber will begin next week , is expected to take six months . " This ship is completely disintegrated , " he said . " It 's scattered within the complexity of these coral reefs . Salvaging will be a tremendous job . " He will not talk about value , although some estimates of the treasure run as high as $40 million . " It could go beyond one 's wildest dreams , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the last handful . " Whichever proves to be true , the Dominican Republic , which released news of the discovery on Dec. 21 , will get half , Mr. Webber 's backers will get their share and he will get " a significant percentage . " The wealth , he said , will bring no abrupt change to the Webbers . " It just gives me the means of providing the security that my family justly deserves , " he said . " I 've never been very security conscious . " " , To me , " Mrs. Webber said , " it 's like finally I can relax . It 's O.K. Everything is going to work out . " For now , said Mr. Webber , who is the No.1 anomaly in Annville , he must go to New York and announce his discovery , then return to the Silver Shoals where " it 's like diving to the depths of a museum and touching antiquities that have not been touched by another human hand in centuries .
