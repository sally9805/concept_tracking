briefly into each dungeon as he passed it . They were all empty , but locked . In some he caught the glimmer of naked white bones . These pits were a relic of a grimmer age , constructed long ago when Belverus was a fortress rather than a city . But evidently their more recent use had been more extensive than the world guessed . Ahead of him , presently , he saw the dim outline of a stair slopingsharply upward , and knew it must be the stair he sought . Then he whirled suddenly , crouching in the deep shadows at its foot . Somewhere behind him something was moving  --  something bulky and stealthy that padded on feet which were not human feet . He was looking down the long row of cells , before each one of which lay a square of dim gray light that was little more than a patch of less dense darkness . But he saw something moving along these squares . What it was he could not tell , but it was heavy and huge , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glimpsed it as it moved across the squares of gray , then lost it as it merged in the expanses of shadow between . It was uncanny , in its stealthy advance , appearing and disappearing like a blur of the vision . He heard the bars rattle as it tried each door in turn . Now it had reached the cell he had so recently quitted , and the door swung open as it tugged . He saw a great bulky shape limned faintly and briefly in the gray doorway , and then the thing had vanished into the dungeon . Sweat beaded Conan 's face and hands . Now he knew why Tarascus had come so subtly to his door , and later had fled so swiftly . The king had unlocked his door , and , somewhere in these hellish pits , had opened a cell or cage that held some grim monstrosity . Now the thing was emerging from the cell and was again advancingup the corridor , its misshapen head close to the ground . It paid no more heed to the locked doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plainly now ; the gray light limned a giant anthropomorphic body , but vaster of bulk and girth than any man . It went on two legs , though it stooped forward , and it was grayish and shaggy , its thick coat shot with silver . Its head was a grisly travesty of the human , its long arms hung nearly to the ground . Conan knew it at last  --  understood the meaning of those crushed and broken bones in the dungeon , and recognized thep51haunter of the pits . It was a gray ape , one of the grisly man-eaters from the forests that wave on the mountainous eastern shores of the Sea of Vilayet . Half mythical and altogether horrible , these apes were the goblins of Hyborian legendry , and were in reality ogres of the natural world , cannibals and murderers of the nighted forests . He knew it scented his presence , for it was coming swiftly now , rolling its barrel-like body rapidly along on its short , mighty bowed legs . He cast a quick glance up the long stair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he could mount to the distant door . He chose to meetit face to face . Conan stepped out into the nearest square of moonlight , so as to have all the advantage of illumination that he could ; for the beast , he knew , could see better than himself in the dark . Instantlythe brute saw him ; its great yellow tusks gleamed in the shadows , but it made no sound . Creatures of night and the silence , the gray apes of Vilayet were voiceless . But in its dim , hideous features , which were a bestial travesty of a human face , showed ghastly exultation . Conan stood poised , watching the oncoming monster without a quiver . He knew he must stake his life on one thrust ; there would be no chance for another ; nor would there be time to strike and spring away . The first blow must kill , and kill instantly , if he hoped to survive that awful grapple . He swept his gaze over the short , squat throat , the hairy swagbelly , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must be the heart ; betterto risk the blade being deflected by the heavy ribs than to strike in where a stroke was not instantly fatal . With full realization of the odds , Conan matched his speed of eye and hand and his muscular power against the brute might and ferocity of the man-eater . He must meet the brute breast to breast , strike a deathblow , and then trust to the ruggedness of his frame to survive the instant of manhandling that was certain to be his . As the ape came rolling in on him , swinging wide its terrible arms , he plunged in between them and struck with all his desperatepower . He felt the blade sink to the hilt in the hairy breast , and instantly , releasing it , he ducked his head and bunched his whole body into one compact mass of knotted muscles , and as he did so he grasped the closing arms and drove his knee fiercely into the monster 's belly , bracing himself against that crushing grapple.  |p52For  one dizzy instant he felt as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then suddenly he was free , sprawling on the floor , and the monster was gasping out its life beneath him , its red eyes turned upward , the hilt of the poniard quivering in its breast . His desperate stab had gone home . Conan was panting as if after long conflict , trembling in every limb . Some of his joints felt as if they had been dislocated , and blood dripped from scratches on his skin where the monster 's talons had ripped ; his muscles and tendons had been savagely wrenched and twisted . If the beast had lived a second longer , it would surely have dismembered him . But the Cimmerian 's mighty strength had resisted , for the fleeting instant it had endured , the dying convulsion of the ape that would have torn a lesser man limb from limb.  |p53CONAN  STOOPED AND tore the knife from the monster 's breast . Then he went swiftly up the stair . What other shapes of fear the darkness held he could not guess , but he had no desire to encounterany more . This touch-and-go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cimmerian . The moonlight was fading from the floor , the darkness closing in , and something like panic pursued him up the stair . He breathed a gusty sigh of relief when he reached the head , and felt the third key turn in the lock . He opened the door slightly , and craned his neck to peer through , half expecting an attack from some human or bestial enemy . He looked into a bare stone corridor , dimly lighted , and a slender , supple figure stood before the door . " Your Majesty ! " It was a low , vibrant cry , half in relief and half in fear . The girl sprang to his side , then hesitated as if abashed . " You bleed , " she said . " You have been hurt ! " He brushed aside the implication with an impatient hand . " Scratches that would n't hurt a baby . Your skewer came in handy , though . But for it Tarascus 's monkey would be cracking my shin-bones for the marrow right now . But what now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will lead you outside the city wall . I have a horse concealed there . " She turned to lead the way down the corridor , but he laid a heavy hand on her naked shoulder . " Walk beside me , " he instructed her softly , passing his massive arm about her lithe waist . " You 've played me fair so far , and I 'm inclined to believe in you ; but I 've lived this long only because I 've trusted no one too far , man or woman . So ! Now if you play me false you wo n't live to enjoy the jest . " She did not flinch at sight of the reddened poniard or the contactof his hard muscles about her supple body . " Cut me down without mercy if I play you false , " she answered . " The very feel of your arm about me , even in menace , is as the fulfillment of a dream . " The vaulted corridor ended at a door , which she opened . Outsidelay another black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curved sword lying on the flags near his hand . He did not move.  | " I drugged his wine , " she whispered , swerving to avoid the recumbent figure . " He is the last , and outer , guard of the pits . None ever escaped from them before , and none has ever wished to seek them ; so only these black men guard them . Only these of all the servants knew it was King Conan that Xaltotun brought a prisoner in his chariot . I was watching , sleepless , from an upper casement that opened into the court , while the other girls slept ; for I knew that a battle was being fought , or had been fought , in the west , and I feared for you ... . " I saw the blacks carry you up the stair , and I recognized you in the torchlight . I slipped into this wing of the palace tonight , in time to see them carry you to the pits . I had not dared come here before nightfall . You must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , let us be wary ! Strange things are afoot in the palace tonight . The slaves said that Xaltotun slept as he often sleeps , drugged by the lotus of Stygia , but Tarascus is in the palace . He entered secretly , through the postern , wrapped in his cloak which was dusty as with long travel , and attended only by his squire , the lean silent Arideus . I can not understand , but I am afraid . " They came out at the foot of a narrow , winding stair , and mounting it , passed through a narrow panel which she slid aside . When they had passed through , she slipped it back in place , and it became merely a portion of the ornate wall . They were in a more spacious corridor , carpeted and tapestried , over which hanging lamps shed a golden glow . Conan listened intently , but he heard no sound throughout the palace . He did not know in what part of the palace he was , or in which direction lay the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the corridor , to halt presently beside an alcove masked with satin tapestry . Drawing this aside , she motioned for him to step into the niche , and whispered : " Wait here ! Beyond that door at the end of the corridor we are likely to meet slaves or eunuchs at any time of the day or night . I will go and see if the way is clear , before we essay it . " Instantly his hair-trigger suspicions were aroused . " Are you leading me into a trap ? " Tears sprang into her dark eyes . She sank to her knees and seized his muscular hand . " Oh , my king , do not mistrust me now ! " Her voice shook withp55desperate urgency . " If you doubt and hesitate , we are lost ! Why should I bring you up out of the pits to betray you now ? " " All right , " he muttered . " I 'll trust you ; though , by Crom , the habits of a lifetime are not easily put aside . Yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swordsmen in Nemedia upon me . But for you Tarascus 's cursed ape would have come upon me in chains and unarmed . Do as you wish , girl . " Kissing his hands , she sprang lithely up and ran down the corridor , to vanish through a heavy double door . He glanced after her , wondering if he was a fool to trust her ; then he shrugged his mighty shoulders and pulled the satin hangingstogether , masking his refuge . It was not strange that a passionateyoung beauty should be risking her life to aid him ; such things had happened often enough in his life . Many women had looked on him with favor , in the days of his wanderings , and in the time of his kingship . Yet he did not remain motionless in the alcove , waiting for her return . Following his instincts , he explored the niche for another exit , and presently found one  --  the opening of a narrow passage , masked by the tapestries , that ran to an ornately carved door , barely visible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as he stared into it , somewhere beyond that carvers door he heard the sound of another door opening and shutting , and then a low mumble of voices . The familiar sound of one of those voices caused a sinister expression to cross his dark face . Without hesitation he glided down the passage , and crouched like a stalkingpanther beside the door . It was not locked , and manipulating it delicately , he pushed it open a crack , with a reckless disregard for possible consequences that only he could have explained or defended . It was masked on the other side by tapestries , but through a thin slit in the velvet he looked into a chamber lit by a candle on an ebony table . There were two men in that chamber . One was a scarred , sinister-looking ruffian in leather breeks and ragged cloak ; the other was Tarascus , king of Nemedia . Tarascus seemed ill at ease . He was slightly pale , and he kept starting and glancing about him , as if expecting and fearing to hear some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he was saying . " He is deep in drugged slumber , but I know not when he may awaken . "  | " Strange to hear words of fear issuing from the lips of Tarascus , " rumbled the other in a harsh , deep voice . The king frowned . " I fear no common man , as you well know . But when I saw the cliffs fall at Valkia I knew that this devil we had resurrected was no charlatan . I fear his powers , because I do not know the full extentof them . But I know that somehow they are connected with this accursed thing which I have stolen from him . It brought him back to life ; so it must be the source of his sorcery . " He had it hidden well ; but following my secret order a slave spied on him and saw him place it in a golden chest , and saw where he hid the chest . Even so , I would not have dared steal it had Xaltotun himself not been sunk in lotus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power . With it Orastes brought him back to life . With it he will make us all slaves , if we are not wary . So take it and cast it into the sea as I have bidden you . And be sure you are so far from land that neither tide nor storm can wash it up on the beach . You have been paid . " " So I have , " grunted the ruffian . " And I owe more than gold to you , king ; I owe you a debt of gratitude . Even thieves can be grateful . " " Whatever debt you may feel you owe me , " answered Tarascus , " will be paid when you have hurled this thing into the sea . " " I 'll ride for Zingara and take ship from Kordava , " promised the other . " I dare not show my head in Argos , because of the matterof a murder or so  --  " " I care not , so it is done . Here it is ; ; a horse awaits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Something passed between them , something that flamed like livingfire . Conan had only a brief glimpse of it ; and then the ruffian pulled a slouch hat over his eyes , drew his cloak about his shoulder , and hurried from the chamber . And as the door closed behind him , Conan moved with the devastating fury of unchained blood-lust . He had held himself in check as long as he could . The sight of his enemy so near him set his wild blood seething and swept away all caution and restraint . Tarascus was turning toward an inner door when Conan tore aside the hangings and leaped like a blood-mad panther into the room . Tarascus wheeled , but even before he could recognize his attacker , Conan 's poniard ripped into him.  |p57But  the blow was not mortal , as Conan knew the instant he struck . His foot had caught in a fold of the curtains and tripped him as he leaped . The point fleshed itself in Tarascus 's shoulder and plowed down along his ribs , and the king of Nemedia screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body hurled him back against the table and it toppled and the candle went out . They were both carried to the floor by the violence of Conan 's rush , and the foot of the tapestry hampered them both in its folds . Conan was stabbing blindly in the dark , Tarascus screaming in a frenzy of panicky terror . As if fear lent him superhuman energy , Tarascus tore free and blundered away in the darkness , shrieking : " Help ! Guards ! Arideus ! Orastes ! Orastes ! " Conan rose , kicking himself free of the tangling tapestries and the broken table , cursing with the bitterness of his blood-thirsty disappointment . He was confused , and ignorant of the plan of the palace . The yells of Tarascus were still resounding in the distance , and a wild outcry was bursting forth in answer . The Nemedian had escaped him in the darkness , and Conan did not know which way he had gone . The Cimmerian 's rash stroke for vengeance had failed , and there remained only the task of saving his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down the passage and into the alcove , glaring out into the lighted corridor , just as Zenobia came running up it , her dark eyes dilated with terror . " Oh , what has happened ? " she cried . " The palace is roused ! I swear I have not betrayed you  --  " " No , it was I who stirred up the hornet 's nest , " he grunted . " I tried to pay off a score . What 's the shortest way out of this ? " She caught his wrist and ran fleetly down the corridor . But before they reached the heavy door at the other end , muffled shouts arose from behind it and the portals began to shake under an assaultfrom the other side . Zenobia wrung her hands and whimpered . " We are cut off ! I locked that door as I returned through it . But they will burst it in in a moment . The way to the postern gate lies through it . " Conan wheeled . Up the corridor , though still out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes were behind as well as before him.  | " Quick ! Into this door ! " the girl cried desperately , running across the corridor and throwing open the door of a chamber . Conan followed her through , and then threw the gold catch behind them . They stood in an ornately furnished chamber , empty but for themselves , and she drew him to a gold-barred window , through which he saw trees and shrubbery . " You are strong , " she panted . " If you can tear these bars away , you may yet escape . The garden is full of guards , but the shrubs are thick , and you may avoid them . The southern wall is also the outer wall of the city . Once over that , you have a chance to get away . A horse is hidden for you in a thicket beside the road that runs westward , a few hundred paces to the south of the fountain of Thrallos . You know where it is ? " " Aye ! But what of you ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joy lighted her beautiful face . " Then my cup of happiness is brimming ! But I will not hamper your escape . Burdened with me you would fail . Nay , do not fear for me . They will never suspect that I aided you willingly . Go ! What you have just said will glorify my life throughout the long years . " He caught her up in his iron arms , crushed her slim , vibrant figure to him and kissed her fiercely on eyes , cheeks , throat and lips , until she lay panting in his embrace ; gusty and tempestuous as a storm-wind , even his love-making was violent . " I 'll go , " he muttered . " But by Crom , I 'll come for you some day ! " Wheeling , he gripped the gold bars and tore them from their sockets with one tremendous wrench ; threw a leg over the sill and went down swiftly , clinging to the ornaments on the wall . He hit the ground running and melted like a shadow into the maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast back over his shoulder showed him Zenobia leaning over the window-sill , her arms stretched after him in mute farewell and renunciation . Guards were running through the garden , all converging toward the palace , where the clamor momentarily grew louder  --  tall men in burnished cuirasses and crested helmets of polished bronze . The starlight struck glints from their gleaming armor , among the trees , betraying their every movement ; but the sound of their comingran far before them . To Conan , wilderness-bred , their rushp59through the shrubbery was like the blundering stampede of cattle . Some of them passed within a few feet of where he lay flat in a thick cluster of bushes , and never guessed his presence . With the palace as their goal , they were oblivious to all else about them . When they had gone shouting on , he rose and fled through the garden with no more noise than a panther would have made . So quickly he came to the southern wall , and mounted the steps that led to the parapet . The wall was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolling the battlements was in sight . Crouching by an embrasure he glanced back at the great palace rearing above the cypresses behind him . Lights blazed from every window , and he could see figures flitting back and forth across them like puppetson invisible strings . He grinned hardly , shook his fist in a gesture of farewell and menace , and let himself over the outer rim of the parapet . A low tree , a few yards below the parapet , received Conan 's weight , as he dropped noiselessly into the branches . An instant later he was racing through the shadows with the swinging hillman'sstride that eats up long miles . Gardens and pleasure villas surrounded the walls of Belverus . Drowsy slaves , sleeping by their watchman 's pikes , did not see the swift and furtive figure that scaled walls , crossed alleys made by the arching branches of trees , and threaded a noiseless way through orchards and vineyards . Watch-dogs woke and lifted their deep-booming clamor at a gliding shadow , half scented , half sensed , and then it was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a blood-spattered couch , under the deft , quick fingers of Orastes . The palace was thronged with wide-eyed , trembling servitors , but the chamber where the king lay was empty save for himself and the renegade priest . " Are you sure he still sleeps ? " Tarascus demanded again , settinghis teeth against the bite of the herb juices with which Orastes was bandaging the long , ragged gash in his shoulder and ribs . " Ishtar , Mitra and Set ! That burns like molten pitch of hell ! " " Which you would be experiencing even now , but for your good fortune , " remarked Orastes . " Whoever wielded that knife struck to kill . Yes , I have told you that Xaltotun still sleeps . Why are you so urgent upon that point ? What has he to do with this ? "  | " You know nothing of what has passed in the palace tonight ? " Tarascus searched the priest 's countenance with burning intensity . " Nothing . As you know , I have been employed in translating manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in the younger languages into script he can read . He was well versed in all the tongues and scripts of his day , but he has not yet learned all the newer languages , and to save time he has me translate these works for him , to learn if any new knowledge has been discovered since his time . I did not know that he had returned last night until he sent for me and told me of the battle . Then I returned to my studies , nor did I know that you had returned until the clamor in the palace brought me out of my cell . " " Then you do not know that Xaltotun brought the king of Aquilonia a captive to this palace ? " Orastes shook his head , without particular surprize . " Xaltotun merely said that Conan would oppose us no more . I supposed that he had fallen , but did not ask the details . " " Xaltotun saved his life when I would have slain him , " snarled Tarascus . " I saw his purpose instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club against us  --  against Amalric , against Valerius , and against myself . So long as Conan lives he is a threat , a unifying factor for Aquilonia , that might be used to compel us into courses we would not otherwise follow . I mistrust this undead Pythonian . Of late I have begun to fear him . " I followed him , some hours after he had departed eastward . I wished to learn what he intended doing with Conan . I found that he had imprisoned him in the pits . I intended to see that the barbariandied , in spite of Xaltotun . And I accomplished  --  " A cautious knock sounded at the door . " That 's Arideus , " grunted Tarascus . " Let him in . " The saturnine squire entered , his eyes blazing with suppressed excitement . " How , Arideus ? " exclaimed Tarascus . " Have you found the man who attacked me ? " " You did not see him , my lord ? " asked Arideus , as one who would assure himself of a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize him ? " " No . It happened so quick , and the candle was out all I could think of was that it was some devil loosed on me by Xaltotun 's magic --  "  | " The Pythonian sleeps in his barred and bolted room . But I have been in the pits . " Arideus twitched his lean shoulders excitedly . " Well , speak , man ! " exclaimed Tarascus impatiently . " What did you find there ? " " An empty dungeon , " whispered the squire . " The corpse of the great ape ! " " What ? " Tarascus started upright , and blood gushed from his opened wound . " Aye ! The man-eater is dead  --  stabbed through the heart  --  and Conan is gone ! " Tarascus was gray of face as he mechanically allowed Orastes to force him prostrate again and the priest renewed work upon his mangled flesh . " Conan ! " he repeated . " Not a crushed corpse  --  escaped ! Mitra ! He is no man ; but a devil himself ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gods and devils ! It was Conan who stabbed me ! Arideus ! " " Aye , your Majesty ! " " Search every nook in the palace . He may be skulking through the dark corridors now like a hungry tiger . Let no niche escape your scrutiny , and beware . It is not a civilized man you hunt , but a blood-mad barbarian whose strength and ferocity are those of a wild beast . Scour the palace-grounds and the city . Throw a cordon about the walls . If you find he has escaped from the city , as he may well do , take a troop of horsemen and follow him . Once past the walls it will be like hunting a wolf through the hills . But haste , and you may yet catch him . " " This is a matter which requires more than ordinary human wits , " said Orastes . " Perhaps we should seek Xaltotun 's advice . " " No ! " exclaimed Tarascus violently . " Let the troopers pursue Conan and slay him . Xaltotun can hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent his escape . " " Well , " said Orastes , " I am no Acheronian , but I am versed in some of the arts , and the control of certain spirits which have cloaked themselves in material substance . Perhaps I can aid you in this matter . " The fountain of Thrallos stood in a clustered ring of oaks besidethe road a mile from the walls of the city . Its musical tinkle reached Conan 's ears through the silence of the starlight . Hep62drank deep of its icy stream , and then hurried southward toward a small , dense thicket he saw there . Rounding it , he saw a great white horse tied among the bushes . Heaving a deep gusty sigh he reached it with one stride  --  a mocking laugh brought him about , glaring . A dully glinting , mail-clad figure moved out of the shadows into the starlight . This was no plumed and burnished palace guardsman . It was a tall man in morion and gray chain-mail  --  one of the Adventurers , a class of warriors peculiar to Nemedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of knighthood , or had fallen from that estate ; hard-bitten fighters , dedicating their lives to war and adventure . They constituted a class of their own , sometimes commanding troops , but themselves accountable to no man but the king . Conan knew that he could have been discovered by no more dangerous a foeman . A quick glance among the shadows convinced him that the man was alone , and he expanded his great chest slightly , digging his toes into the turf , as his thews coiled tensely . " I was riding for Belverus on Amalric 's business , " said the Adventurer , advancing warily . The starlight was a long sheen on the great two-handed sword he bore naked in his hand . " A horse whinnied to mine from the thicket . I investigated and thought it strange a steed should be tethered here . I waited  --  and lo , I have caught a rare prize ! " The Adventurers lived by their swords . " I know you , " muttered the Nemedian . " You are Conan , king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of the Valkia , but  --  " Conan sprang as a dying tiger springs . Practised fighter though the Adventurer was , he did not realize the desperate quickness that lurks in barbaric sinews . He was caught off guard , his heavy sword half lifted . Before he could either strike or parry , the king 's poniard sheathed itself in his throat , above the gorget , slanting downward into his heart . With a choked gurgle he reeled and went down , and Conan ruthlessly tore his blade free as his victim fell . The white horse snorted violently and shied at the sight and scent of blood on the sword . Glaring down at his lifeless enemy , dripping poniard in hand , sweat glistening on his broad breast , Conan poised like a statue , listening intently . In the woods about there was no sound , save forp63the sleepy cheep of awakened birds . But in the city , a mile away , he heard the strident blare of a trumpet . Hastily he bent over the fallen man . A few seconds ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended to be conveyed by word of mouth . But he did not pause in his task . It was not many hours until dawn . A few minutes later the white horse was galloping westward along the white road , and the rider wore the gray mail of a Nemedian Adventurer.  |p64CONAN  KNEW HIS only chance of escape lay in speed . He did not even consider hiding somewhere near Belverus until the chase passed on ; he was certain that the uncanny ally of Tarascus would be able to ferret him out . Besides , he was not one to skulk and hide ; an open fight or an open chase , either suited his temperamentbetter . He had a long start , he knew . He would lead them a grinding race for the border . Zenobia had chosen well in selecting the white horse . His speed , toughness and endurance were obvious . The girl knew weapons and horses , and , Conan reflected with some satisfaction , she knew men . He rode westward at a gait that ate up the miles . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove-shelteredvillages and white-walled villas amid spacious fields and orchardsthat grew sparser as he fared westward . As the villages thinned , the land grew more rugged , and the keeps that frowned from eminences told of centuries of border war . But none rode down from those castles to challenge or halt him . The lords of the keeps were following the banner of Amalric ; the pennons that were wont to wave over these towers were now floating over the Aquilonian plains . When the last huddled village fell behind him , Conan left the road , Which was beginning to bend toward the northwest , toward the distant passes . To keep to the road would mean to pass by border towers , still garrisoned with armed men who would not allow him to pass unquestioned . He knew there would be no patrolsriding the border marches on either side , as in ordinary times , but there were those towers , and with dawn there would probably be cavalcades of returning soldiers with wounded men in ox-carts . This road from Belverus was the only road that crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a series of passes through the hills , and on either hand lay a wide expanse of wild , sparsely inhabited mountains . He maintained his due westerlydirection , intending to cross the border deep in the wilds of the hills that lay to the south of the passes . It was a shorter route , more arduous , but safer for a hunted fugitive . One man on a horse could traverse country an army would find impassable . But at dawn he had not reached the hills ; they were a long , low ,  |p65blue  rampart stretching along the horizon ahead of him . Here there were neither farms nor villages , no white-walled villas loomingamong clustering trees . The dawn wind stirred the tall stiff grass , and there was nothing but the long rolling swells of brown earth , covered with dry grass , and in the distance the gaunt walls of a stronghold on a low hill . Too many Aquilonian raiders had crossed the mountains in not too-distant days for the countryside to be thickly settled as it was farther to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and high overhead sounded a weird crying as a straggling wedge of wild geese winged swiftly southward . In a grassy swale Conan halted and unsaddled his mount . Its sides were heaving , its coat plasteredwith sweat . He had pushed it unmercifully through the hours before dawn . While it munched the brittle grass and rolled , he lay at the crest of the low slope , staring eastward . Far away to the northward he could see the road he had left , streaming like a white ribbon over a distant rise . No black dots moved along that glistening ribbon . There was no sign about the castle in the distance to indicate that the keepers had noticed the lone wayfarer . An hour later the land still stretched bare . The only sign of life was a glint of steel on the far-off battlements , a raven in the sky that wheeled backward and forth , dipping and rising as if seeking something . Conan saddled and rode westward at a more leisurely gait . As he topped the farther crest of the slope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , he saw the raven flapping high above him , cawing incessantly . As he rode on , it followed him , maintaining its position and making the morning hideous with its strident cries , heedless of his efforts to drive it away . This kept up for hours , until Conan 's teeth were on edge , and he felt that he would give half his kingdom to be allowed to wring that black neck . " Devils of hell ! " he roared in futile rage , shaking his mailed fist at the frantic bird . " Why do you harry me with your squawking ? Begone , you black spawn of perdition , and peck for wheat in the farmers ' fields ! " He was ascending the first pitch of the hills , and he seemed to hear an echo of the bird 's clamor far behind him . Turning in his saddle , he presently made out another black dot hanging in thep66blue . Beyond that again he caught the glint of the afternoon sun on steel . That could mean only one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaten road , which was out of his sight beyond the horizon . They were following him . His face grew grim and he shivered slightly as he stared at the raven that wheeled high above him . " So it is more than the whim of a brainless beast ? " he muttered . " Those riders can not see you , spawn of hell ; but the other bird can see you , and they can see him . You follow me , he follows you , and they follow him . Are you only a craftily trained featheredcreature , or some devil in the form of a bird ? Did Xaltotun set you on my trail ? Are you Xaltotun ? " Only a strident screech answered him , a screech vibrating with harsh mockery . Conan wasted no more breath on his dusky betrayer . Grimly he settled to the long grind of the hills . He dared not push the horse too hard ; the rest he had allowed it had not been enough to freshen it . He was still far ahead of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was almost a certainty that their horses were fresher than his , for they had undoubtedly changed mounts at that castle he had passed . The going grew rougher , the scenery more rugged , steep grassy slopes pitching up to densely timbered mountainsides . Here , he knew , he might elude his hunters , but for that hellish bird that squalled incessantly above him . He could no longer see them in this broken country , but he was certain that they still followed him , guided unerringly by their feathered allies . That black shape became like a demoniac incubus , hounding him through measurelesshells . The stones he hurled with a curse went wide or fell harmless , though in his youth he had felled hawks on the wing . The horse was tiring fast . Conan recognized the grim finality of his position . He sensed an inexorable driving fate behind all this . He could not escape . He was as much a captive as he had been in the pits of Belverus . But he was no son of the Orient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , he would at least take some of his foes into eternity with him . He turned into a wide thicket of larches that masked a slope , looking for a place to turn at bay . Then ahead of him there rang a strange , shrill scream , human yet weirdly timbred . An instant later he had pushed through ap67screen of branches , and saw the source of that eldritch cry . In a small glade below him four soldiers in Nemedian chain-mail were binding a noose about the neck of a gaunt old woman in peasant garb . A heap of fagots , bound with cord on the ground near by , showed what her occupation had been when surprized by these stragglers . Conan felt slow fury swell his heart as he looked silently down and saw the ruffians dragging her toward a tree whose low-spreadingbranches were obviously intended to act as a gibbet . He had crossed the frontier an hour ago . He was standing on his own soil , watching the murder of one of his own subjects . The old woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched , she lifted her head and voiced again the strange , weird , far-carrying call he had heard before . It was echoed as if in mockeryby the raven flapping above the trees . The soldiers laughed roughly , and one struck her in the mouth . Conan swung from his weary steed and dropped down the face of the rocks , landing with a clang of mail on the grass . The four men wheeled at the sound and drew their swords , gaping at the mailed giant who faced them , sword in hand . Conan laughed harshly . His eyes were bleak as flint . " Dogs ! " he said without passion and without mercy . " Do Nemedian jackals set themselves up as executioners and hang my subjects at will ? First you must take the head of their king . Here I stand , awaiting your lordly pleasure ! " The soldiers stared at him uncertainly as he strode toward them . " Who is this madman ? " growled a bearded ruffian . " He wears Nemedian mail , but speaks with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " Cut him down , and then we 'll hang the old hag . " And so saying he ran at Conan , lifting his sword . But before he could strike , the king 's great blade lashed down , splitting helmet and skull . The man fell before him , but the others were hardy rogues . They gave tongue like wolves and surged about the lone figure in the gray mail , and the clamor and din of steel drowned the cries of the circling raven . Conan did not shout . His eyes coals of blue fire and his lips smiling bleakly , he lashed right and left with his two-handed sword . For all his size he was quick as a cat on his feet , and hep68was constantly in motion , presenting a moving target so that thrusts and swings cut empty air oftener than not . Yet when he struck he was perfectly balanced , and his blows fell with devastatingpower . Three of the four were down , dying in their own blood , and the fourth was bleeding from half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parried frantically , when Conan 's spur caught in the surcoat of one of the fallen men . The king stumbled , and before he could catch himself the Nemedian , with the frenzy of desperation , rushed him so savagely that Conan staggered and fell sprawling over the corpse . The Nemedian croaked in triumph and sprang forward , lifting his great sword with both hands over his right shoulder , as he braced his legs wide for the stroke  --  and then , over the prostrate king , something huge and hairy shot like a thunderbolt full on the soldier'sbreast , and his yelp of triumph changed to a shriek of death . Conan , scrambling up , saw the man lying dead with his throat torn out , and a great gray wolf stood over him , head sunk as it smelt the blood that formed a pool on the grass . The king turned as the old woman spoke to him . She stood straight and tall before him , and in spite of her ragged garb , her features , clear-cut and aquiline , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant woman . She called to the wolf and it trotted to her side like a great dog and rubbed its giant shoulder against her knee , while it gazed at Conan with great green lambent eyes . Absently she laid her hand upon its mighty neck , and so the two stood regarding the king of Aquilonia . He found their steady gaze disquieting , though there was no hostility in it . " Men say King Conan died beneath the stones and dirt when the cliffs crumbled by Valkia , " she said in a deep , strong , resonant voice . " So they say , " he growled . He was in no mood for controversy , and he thought of those armored riders who were pushing nearer every moment . The raven above him cawed stridently , and he cast an involuntary glare upward , grinding his teeth in a spasm of nervous irritation . Up on the ledge the white horse stood with drooping head . The old woman looked at it , and then at the raven ; and then she lifted a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call , the raven wheeled , suddenly mute , and raced eastward . But before it had got out of sight , the shadow of mighty wings fellp69across it . An eagle soared up from the tangle of frees , and rising above it , swooped and struck the black messenger to the earth . The strident voice of betrayal was stilled for ever . " Crom ! " muttered Conan , staring at the old woman . " Are you a magician , too ? " " I am Zelata , " she said . " The people of the valleys call me a witch . Was that child of the night guiding armed men on your trail ? " " Aye . " She did not seem to think the answer fantastic . " They can not be far behind me . " " Lead your horse and follow me , King Conan , " she said briefly . Without comment he mounted the rocks and brought his horse down to the glade by a circuitous path . As he came he saw the eagle reappear , dropping lazily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shoulder , spreading its great wings lightly so as not to crush her with its weight . Without a word she led the way , the great wolf trotting at her side , the eagle soaring above her . Through deep thickets and along tortuous ledges poised over deep ravines she led him , and finally along a narrow precipice-edged path to a curious dwelling of stone , half hut , half cavern , beneath a cliff hidden among the gorges and crags . The eagle flew to the pinnacle of this cliff , and perched there like a motionless sentinel . Still silent , Zelata stabled the horse in a near-by cave , with leaves and grass piled high for provender , and a tiny spring bubbling in the dim recesses . In the hut she seated the king on a rude , hide-covered bench , and she herself sat upon a low stool before the tiny fireplace , while she made a fire of tamarisk chunks and prepared a frugal meal . The great wolf drowsed beside her , facing the fire , his huge head sunk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do not fear to sit in the hut of a witch ? " she asked , breakingher silence at last . An impatient shrug of his gray-mailed shoulders was her guest 's only reply . She gave into his hands a wooden dish heaped with dried fruits , cheese and barley bread , and a great pot of the heady upland beer , brewed from barley grown in the high valleys . " I have found the brooding silence of the glens more pleasing than the babble of city streets , " she said . " The children of the wild are kinder than the children of men . " Her hand briefly stroked thep70ruff of the sleeping wolf . " My children were afar from me today , or I had not needed your sword , my king . They were coming at my call . " " What grudge had those Nemedian dogs against you ? " Conan demanded . " Skulkers from the invading army straggle all over the countryside , from the frontier to Tarantia , " she answered . " The foolish villagers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold hidden away , so as to divert their attentions from their villages . They demanded treasure from me , and my answers angered them . But neither skulkers nor the men who pursue you , nor any raven will find you here . " He shook his head , eating ravenously . " I 'm for Tarantia . " She shook her head . " You thrust your head into the dragon 's jaws . Best seek refuge abroad . The heart is gone from your kingdom . " " What do you mean ? " he demanded . " Battles have been lost before , yet wars won . A kingdom is not lost by a single defeat . " " And you will go to Tarantia ? " " Aye . Prospero will be holding it against Amalric . " " Are you sure ? " " Hell 's devils , woman ! " he exclaimed wrathfully . " What else ? " She shook her head . " I feel that it is otherwise . Let us see . Not lightly is the veil rent ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your capital city . " Conan did not see what she cast upon the fire , but the wolf whimpered in his dreams , and a green smoke gathered and billowed up into the hut . And as he watched , the walls and ceiling of the hut seemed to widen , to grow remote and vanish , merging with infinite immensities ; the smoke rolled about him , blotting out everything . And in it forms moved and faded , and stood out in startling clarity . He stared at the familiar towers and streets of Tarantia , where a mob seethed and screamed , and at the same time he was somehow able to see the banners of Nemedia moving inexorably westward through the smoke and flame of a pillaged land . In the great square of Tarantia the frantic throng milled and yammered , screaming that the king was dead , that the barons were girding themselves to divide the land between them , and that the rule of ap71king , even of Valerius , was better than anarchy . Prospero , shining in his armor , rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust Count Trocero , urging them to man the wall and aid his knights in defending the city . They turned on him , shrieking with fear and unreasoning rage , howling that he was Trocero 's butcher , a more evil foe than Amalric himself . Offal and stones were hurled at his knights . A slight blurring of the picture , that might have denoted a passingof time , and then Conan saw Prospero and his knights filing out of the gates and spurring southward . Behind him the city was in an uproar . " Fools ! " muttered Conan thickly . " Fools ! Why could they not trust Prospero ? Zelata , if you are making game of me , with some trickery  --  " " This has passed , " answered Zelata imperturbably , though somberly . " It was the evening of the day that has passed when Prospero rode out of Tarantia , with the hosts of Amalric almost within sight . From the walls men saw the flame of their pillaging . So I read it in the smoke . At sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even now , in the royal hall of Taran-tia  --  " Abruptly Conan was looking into , the great coronation hall . Valerius stood on the regal dais , clad in ermine robes , and Amalric , still in his dusty , blood-stained armor , placed a rich and gleaming circlet on his yellow locks  --  the crown of Aquilonia ! The people cheered ; long lines of steel-clad Nemedian warriors looked grimly on , and nobles long in disfavor at Conan 's court strutted and swaggered with the emblem of Valerius on their sleeves . " Crom ! " It was an explosive imprecation from Conan 's lips as he started up , his great fists clenched into hammers , his veins on his temples knotting , his features convulsed . " A Nemedian placing the crown of Aquilonia on that renegade  --  in the royal hall of Tarantia ! " As if dispelled by his violence , the smoke faded , and he saw Zelata 's black eyes gleaming at him through the mist . " You have seen  --  the people of your capital have forfeited the freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sold themselves to the slavers and the butchers . They have shown that they do not trust their destiny . Can you rely upon them for the winning back of your kingdom ? "  | " They thought I was dead , " he grunted , recovering some of his poise . " I have no son . Men ca n't be governed by a memory . What if the Nemedians have taken Tarantia ? There still remain the provinces , the barons , and the people of the countrysides . Valerius has won an empty glory . " " You are stubborn , as befits a fighter . I can not show you the future , I can not show you all the past . Nay , I show you nothing . I merely make you see windows opened in the veil by powers unguessed . Would you look into the past for a clue of the present ? " " Aye . " He seated himself abruptly . Again the green smoke rose and billowed . Again images unfoldedbefore him , this time alien and seemingly irrelevant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shadowsupholding images of hideous , half-bestial gods . Men moved in the shadows , dark , wiry men , clad in red , silken loincloths . They were bearing a green jade sarcophagus along a gigantic black corridor . But before he could tell much about what he saw , the scene shifted . He saw a cavern , dim , shadowy and haunted with a strange intangible horror . On an altar of black stone stood a curiousgolden vessel , shaped like the shell of a scallop . Into this caverncame some of the same dark , wiry men who had borne the mummy-case . They seized the golden vessel , and then the shadowsswirled around them and what happened he could not say . But he saw a glimmer in a whorl of darkness , like a ball of living fire . Then the smoke was only smoke , drifting up from the fire of tamarisk chunks , thinning and fading . " But what does this portend ? " he demanded , bewildered . " What I saw in Tarantia I can understand . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple of Set , in Stygia ? And that cavern -- I 've never seen or heard of anything like it , in all my wanderings . If you can show me that much , these shreds of vision which mean nothing , disjointed , why can you not show me all that is to occur ? " Zelata stirred the fire without replying . " These things are governed by immutable laws , " she said at last . " I can not make you understand ; I do not altogether understandmyself , though I have sought wisdom in the silences of the high places for more years than I can remember . I can not save you , though I would if I might . Man must , at last , work out his own salvation . Yet perhaps wisdom may come to me in dreams ,  |p73and  in the morn I may be able to give you the clue to the enigma . " " What enigma ? " he demanded . " The mystery that confronts you , whereby you have lost a kingdom , " she answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearth . " Sleep , " she said briefly . Without a word he stretched himself upon it , and sank into restlessbut deep sleep through which phantoms moved silently and monstrous shapeless shadows crept . Once , limned against a purple sunless horizon , he saw the mighty walls and towers of a great city such as rose nowhere on the waking earth he knew . Its colossal pylons and purple minarets lifted toward the stars , and over it , floating like a giant mirage , hovered the bearded countenance of the man Xaltotun . Conan woke in the chill whiteness of early dawn , to see Zelata crouched beside the tiny fire . He had not awakened once in the night , and the sound of the great wolf leaving or entering should have roused him . Yet the wolf was there , beside the hearth , with its shaggy coat wet with dew , and with more than dew . Blood glistenedwetly amid the thick fell , and there was a cut upon his shoulder . Zelata nodded , without looking around , as if reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted before dawn , and red was the hunting . I think the man who hunted a king will hunt no more , neither man nor beast . " Conan stared at the great beast with strange fascination as he moved to take the food Zelata offered him . " When I come to my throne again I wo n't forget , " he said briefly . " You 've befriended me  --  by Crom , I ca n't remember when I 've lain down and slept at the mercy of man or woman as I did last night . But what of the riddle you would read me this morn ? " A long silence ensued , in which the crackle of the tamarisks was loud on the hearth . " Find the heart of your kingdom , " she said at last . " There lies your defeat and your power . You fight more than mortal man . You will not press the throne again unless you find the heart of your kingdom . "  | " Do you mean the city of Tarantia ? " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through whose lips the gods speak . My lips are sealed by them lest I speak too much . You must find the heart of your kingdom . I can say no more . My lips are opened and sealed by the gods . " Dawn was still white on the peaks when Conan rode westward . A glance back showed him Zelata standing in the door of her hut , inscrutable as ever , the great wolf beside her . A gray sky arched overhead , and a moaning wind was chill with a promise of winter . Brown leaves fluttered slowly down from the bare branches , sifting upon his mailed shoulders . All day he pushed through the hills , avoiding roads and villages . Toward nightfall he began to drop down from the heights , tier by tier , and saw the broad plains of Aquilonia spread out beneath him . Villages and farms lay close to the foot of the hills on the westernside of the mountains for , for half a century , most of the raiding across the frontier had been done by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm huts and villas had stood . In the gathering darkness Conan rode slowly on . There was little fear of discovery , which he dreaded from friend as well as from foe . The Nemedians had remembered old scores on their westward drive , and Valerius had made no attempt to restrain his allies . He did not count on winning the love of the common people . A vast swath of desolation had been cut through the country from the foothills westward . Conan cursed as he rode over blackened expanses that had been rich fields , and saw the gaunt gable-ends of burned houses jutting against the sky . He moved through an empty and deserted land , like a ghost out of a forgotten and outworn past . The speed with which the army had traversed the land showed what little resistance it had encountered . Yet had Conan been leading his Aquilonians the invading army would have been forced to buy every foot they gained with their blood . The bitter realization permeated his soul ; he was not the representative of a dynasty . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynasticblood Valerius boasted had more hold on the minds of menp75than the memory of Conan and the freedom and power he had given the kingdom . No pursuers followed him down out of the hills . He watched for wandering or returning Nemedian troops , but met none . Skulkers gave him a wide path , supposing him to be one of the conquerors , what of his harness . Groves and rivers were far more plentiful on the western side of the mountains , and coverts for concealment were not lacking . So he moved across the pillaged land , halting only to rest his horse , eating frugally of the food Zelata had given him , until , on a dawn when he lay hidden on a river bank where willows and oaks grew thickly , he glimpsed , afar , across the rolling plains dotted with rich groves , the blue and golden towers of Tarantia . He was no longer in a deserted land , but one teeming with varied life . His progress thenceforth was slow and cautious , through thick woods and unfrequented byways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galannus.  |p76THE  COUNTRYSIDE ABOUT Tarantia had escaped the fearful ravagingof the more easterly provinces . There were evidences of the march of a conquering army in broken hedges , plundered fields and looted granaries , but torch and steel had not been loosed wholesale . There was but one grim splotch on the landscape  --  a charred expanse of ashes and blackened stone , where , Conan knew , had once stood the stately villa of one of his staunchest supporters . The king dared not openly approach the Galannus farm , which lay only a few miles from the city . In the twilight he rode through an extensive woodland , until he sighted a keeper 's lodge through the trees . Dismounting and tying his horse , he approached the thick , arched door with the intention of sending the keeper after Servius . He did not know what enemies the manor house might be sheltering . He had seen no troops , but they might be quartered all over the countryside . But as he drew near , he saw the door open and a compact figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a path that wound away through the woods . " Servius ! " At the low call the master of the plantation wheeled with a startledexclamation . His hand flew to the short hunting-sword at his hip , and he recoiled from the tall gray steel figure standing in the dusk before him . " Who are you ? " he demanded . " What is your  --  Mitral " His breath hissed inward and his ruddy face paled . " Avaunt ! " he ejaculated . " Why have you come back from the gray lands of death to terrify me ? I was always your true liegeman in your life-time  --  " " As I still expect you to be , " answered Conan . " Stop trembling , man ; I 'm flesh and blood . " Sweating with uncertainty Servius approached and stared into the face of the mail-clad giant , and then , convinced of the reality of what he saw , he dropped to one knee and doffed his plumed cap . " Your Majesty ! Truly , this is a miracle passing belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirge , days agone . Men said youp77died at Valkia , crushed under a million tons of earth and broken granite . " " It was another in my harness , " grunted Conan . " But let us talk later . If there is such a thing as a joint of beef on your board  --  " " Forgive me , my lord ! " cried Servius , springing to his feet . " The dust of travel is gray on your mail , and I keep you standing here without rest or sup ! Mitra ! I see well enough now that you are alive , but I swear , when I turned and saw you standing all gray and dim in the twilight , the marrow of my knees turned to water . It is an ill thing to meet a man you thought dead in the woodland at dusk . " " Bid the keeper see to my steed which is tied behind yonder oak , " requested Conan , and Servius nodded , drawing the king up the path . The patrician , recovering from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will send a servant from the manor , " he said . " The keeper is in his lodge  --  but I dare not trust even my servants in these days . It is better that only I know of your presence . " Approaching the great house that glimmered dimly through the trees , he turned aside into a little-used path that ran between close-set oaks whose intertwining branches formed a vault overhead , shutting out the dim light of the gathering dusk . Servius hurriedon through the darkness without speaking , and with somethingresembling panic in his manner , and presently led Conan through a small side-door into a narrow , dimly illuminated corridor . They traversed this in haste and silence , and Servius brought the king into a spacious chamber with a high , oak-beamed ceiling and richly paneled walls . Logs flamed in the wide fireplace , for there was a frosty edge to the air , and a great meat pasty in a stone platter stood smoking on a broad mahogany board . Servius locked the massive door and extinguished the candles that stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminatedonly by the fire on the hearth . " Your pardon , your Majesty , " he apologized . " These are periloustimes ; spies lurk everywhere . It were better that none be able to peer through the windows and recognize you . This pasty , however , is just from the oven , as I intended supping on my return from talk with my keeper . If your Majesty would deign  --  " " The light is sufficient , " grunted Conan , seating himself with scant ceremony , and drawing his poniard.  |p78He  dug ravenously into the luscious dish , and washed it down with great gulps of wine from grapes grown in Servius 's vineyards . He seemed oblivious to any sense of peril , but Servius shifted uneasily on his settle by the fire , nervously fingering the heavy gold chain about his neck . He glanced continually at the diamondpanesof the casement , gleaming dimly in the firelight , and cocked his ear toward the door , as if half expecting to hear the pad of furtivefeet in the corridor without . Finishing his meal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . " I wo n't jeopardize you long by my presence , Servius , " he said abruptly . " Dawn will find me far from your plantation . " " My lord  --  " Servius lifted his hands in expostulation , but Conan waved his protests aside . " I know your loyalty and your courage . Both are above reproach . But if Valerius has usurped my throne , it would be death for you to shelter me , if you were discovered . " " I am not strong enough to defy him openly , " admitted Servius . " The fifty men-at-arms I could lead to battle would be but a handful of straws . You saw the ruins of Emilius Scavonus 's planta-tion ? " Conan nodded , frowning darkly . " He was the strongest patrician in this province , as you know . He refused to give his allegiance to Valerius . The Nemedians burned him in the ruins of his own villa . After that the rest of us saw the futility of resistance , especially as the people of Tarantia refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he levied a tax upon us that will ruin many . But what could we do ? We thought you were dead . Many of the barons had been slain , others taken prisoner . The army was shattered and scattered . You have no heir to take the crown . There was no one to lead us  --  " " Was there not Count Trocero of Poitain ? " demanded Conanharshly . Servius spread his hands helplessly . " It is true that his general Prospero was in the field with a small army . Retreating before Amalric , he urged men to rally to his banner . But with your Majesty dead , men remembered old wars and civil brawls , and how Trocero and his Poitanians once rode through these provinces even as Amalric was riding now , with torch and sword . The barons were jealous of Trocero . Some men  --  spies of Valerius perhaps  --  shouted that the Count of Poitain intended seizing the crown for himself . Old sectional hates flared up again . If we had had one man with dynastic blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Nemedia . But we had none . " The barons who followed you loyally would not follow one of their own number , each holding himself as good as his neighbor , each fearing the ambitions of the others . You were the cord that held the fagots together . When the cord was cut , the fagots fell apart . If you had had a son , the barons would have rallied loyally to him . But there was no point for their patriotism to focus upon . " The merchants and commoners , dreading anarchy and a return of feudal days when each baron was his own law , cried out that any king was better than none , even Valerius , who was at least of the blood of the old dynasty . There was no one to oppose him when he rode up at the head of his steel-clad hosts , with the scarletdragon of Nemedia floating over him , and rang his lance against the gates of Tarantia . " Nay , the people threw open the gates and knelt in the dust before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said they had rather be ruled by Valerius than by Trocero . They said  --  truthfully  --  that the barons would not rally to Trocero , but that many would accept Valerius . They said that by yielding to Valerius they would escape the devastation of civil war , and the fury of the Nemedians . Prospero rode southward with his ten thousand knights , and the horsemen of the Nemediansentered the city a few hours later . They did not follow him . They remained to see that Valerius was crowned in Tarantia . " " Then the old witch 's smoke showed the truth , " muttered Conan , feeling a queer chill along his spine . " Amalric crowned Valerius ? " " Aye , in the coronation hall , with the blood of slaughter scarcely dried on his hands . " " And do the people thrive under his benevolent rule ? " asked Conan with angry irony . " He lives like a foreign prince in the midst of a conquered land , " answered Servius bitterly . " His court is filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a large garrisonof them occupy the citadel . Aye , the hour of the Dragon has come at last . " Nemedians swagger like lords through the streets . Women arep80outraged and merchants plundered daily , and Valerius either can , or will , make no attempt to curb them . Nay , he is but their puppet , their figurehead . Men of sense knew he would be , and the people are beginning to find it out . " Amalric has ridden forth with a strong army to reduce the outlying provinces where some of the barons have defied him . But there is no unity among them . Their jealousy of each other is stronger than their fear of Amalric . He will crush them one by one . Many castles and cities , realizing that , have sent in their submission . Those who resist fare miserably . The Nemedians are glutting their long hatred . And their ranks are swelled by Aquilonianswhom fear , gold , or necessity of occupation are forcing into their armies . It is a natural consequence . " Conan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight on the richly carved oaken panels . " Aquilonia has a king instead of the anarchy they feared , " said Servius at last . " Valerius does not protect his subjects against his allies . Hundreds who could not pay the ransom imposed upon them have been sold to the Kothic slave-traders . " Conan 's head jerked up and a lethal flame lit his blue eyes . He swore gustily , his mighty hands knotting into iron hammers . " Aye , white men sell white men and white women , as it was in the feudal days . In the palaces of Shem and of Turan they will live out the lives of slaves . Valerius is king , but the unity for which the people looked , even though of the sword , is not complete . " Gunderland in the north and Poitain in the south are yet unconquered , and there are unsubdued provinces in the west , where the border barons have the backing of Bossonian bowmen . Yet these outlying provinces are no real menace to Valerius . They must remain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep their independence . Here Valerius and his foreign knights are supreme . " " Let him make the best of it then , " said Conan grimly . " His time is short . The people will rise when they learn that I 'm alive . We 'll take Tarantia back before Amalric can return with his army . Then we 'll sweep these dogs from the kingdom . " Servius was silent . The crackle of the fire was loud in the stillness . " Well , " exclaimed Conan impatiently , " why do you sit with your head bent , staring at the hearth ? Do you doubt what I have said ? "  |p81Servius  avoided the king 's eye . " What mortal man can do , you will do , your Majesty , " he answered . " I have ridden behind you in battle , and I know that no mortal being can stand before your sword . " " What , then ? " Servius drew his fur-trimmed jupon closer about him , and shiveredin spite of the flame . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said presently . " What then ? " " What mortal can fight against sorcery ? Who is this veiled man who communes at midnight with Valerius and his allies , as men say , who appears and disappears so mysteriously ? Men say in whispers that he is a great magician who died thousands of years ago , but has returned from death 's gray lands to overthrow the king of Aquilonia and restore the dynasty of which Valerius is heir . " " What matter ? " exclaimed Conan angrily . " I escaped from the devil-haunted pits of Belverus , and from diabolism in the mountains . If the people rise  --  " Servius shook his head . " Your staunchest supporters in the eastern and central provincesare dead , fled or imprisoned . Gunderland is far to the north , Poitain far to the south . The Bossonians have retired to their marches far to the west . It would take weeks to gather and concentratethese forces , and before that could be done , each levy would be attacked separately by Amalric and destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip the scales for us ! " exclaimed Conan . " We could seize Tarantia and hold it against Amalric until the Gundermen and Poitanians could get here . " Servius hesitated , and his voice sank to a whisper . " Men say you died accursed . Men say this veiled stranger cast a spell upon you to slay you and break your army . The great bell has tolled your dirge . Men believe you to be dead . And the central provinces would not rise , even if they knew you lived . They would not dare . Sorcery defeated you at Valkia . Sorcery brought the news to Tarantia , for that very night men were shouting of it in the streets . " A Nemedian priest loosed black magic again in the streets of Tarantia to slay men who still were loyal to your memory . I my/self saw it . Armed men dropped like flies and died in the streets in a manner no man could understand . And the lean priest laughed and said : I am only Altaro , only an acolyte of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears the veil ; not mine is the power ; the power but works through me . " " Well , " said Conan harshly , " is it not better to die honorably than to live in infamy ? Is death worse than oppression , slavery and ultimate destruction ? " " When the fear of sorcery is in , reason is out , " replied Servius . " The fear of the central provinces is too great to allow them to rise for you . The outlying provinces would fight for you but the same sorcery that smote your army at Valkia would smite you again . The Nemedians hold the broadest , richest and most thickly populated sections of Aquilonia , and they can not be defeated by the forces which might still be at your command . You would be sacrificing your loyal subjects uselessly . In sorrow I say it , but it is true : King Conan , you are a king without a kingdom . " Conan stared into the fire without replying . A smoldering log crashed down among the flames without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing ruin of his kingdom . Again Conan felt the presence of a grim reality behind the veil of material illusion . He sensed again the inexorable drive of a ruthless fate . A feeling of furious panic tugged at his soul , a sense of being trapped , and a red rage that burned to destroy and kill . " Where are the officials of my court ? " he demanded at last . " Pallantides was sorely wounded at Valkia , was ransomed by his family , and now lies in his castle in Attalus . He will be fortunateif he ever rides again . Publius , the chancellor , has fled the kingdom in disguise , no man knows whither . The council has been disbanded . Some were imprisoned , some banished . Many of yourloyal subjects have been put to death . Tonight , for instance , theCountess Albiona dies under the headsman 's ax . " Conan started and stared at Servius with such anger smolderingin his blue eyes that the patrician shrank back . " Why ? " " Because she would not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her henchmen sold into slavery , and at midnight , in the Iron Tower , her head must fall . Be advised , my king  --  to me you will ever be my king  --  and flee before you are discovered . In these days none is safe . Spies and informers creep among us , betraying the slightest deed or word of discontent asp83treason and rebellion . If you make yourself known to your subjectsit will only end in your capture and death . " My horses and all the men that I can trust are at your disposal . Before dawn we can be far from Tarantia , and well on our way toward the border . If I can not aid you to recover your kingdom , I can at least follow you into exile . " Conan shook his head . Servius glanced uneasily at him as he sat staring into the fire , his chin propped on his mighty fist . The firelight gleamed redly on his steel mail , on his baleful eyes . They burned in the firelight like the eyes of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , and now more strongly than ever , of somethingalien about the king . That great frame under the mail mesh was too hard and supple for a civilized man ; the elemental fire of the primitive burned in those smoldering eyes . Now the barbaric suggestion about the king was more pronounced , as if in his extremitythe outward aspects of civilization were stripped away , to reveal the primordial core . Conan was reverting to his pristine type . He did not act as a civilized man would act under the same conditions , nor did his thoughts run in the same channels . He was unpredictable . It was only a stride from the king of Aquilonia to the skin-clad slayer of the Cimmerian hills . " I 'll ride to Poitain , if it may be , " Conan said at last . " But I 'll ride alone . And I have one last duty to perform as king of Aquilonia . " " What do you mean , your Majesty ? " asked Servius , shaken by a premonition . " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've failed all my other loyal subjects , it seems  --  if they take her head , they can have mine too . " " This is madness ! " cried Servius , staggering up and clutching his throat , as if he already felt the noose closing about it . " There are secrets to the Tower Which few know , " said Conan . " Anyway , I 'd be a dog to leave Albiona to die because of her loyaltyto me . I may be a king without a kingdom , but I 'm not a man without honor . " " It will ruin us all ! " whispered Servius . " It will ruin no one but me if I fail . You 've risked enough . I ride alone tonight . This is all I want you to do : procure me a patch for my eye , a staff for my hand , and garments such as travelerswear. "  |p84MANY  MEN PASSED through the great arched gates of Tarantia betweensunset and midnight  --  belated travelers , merchants from afar with heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vineyards . Now that Valerius was supreme in the centralprovinces , there was no rigid scrutiny of the folk who flowed in a steady stream through the wide gates . Discipline had been relaxed . The Nemedian soldiers who stood on guard were half drunk , and much too busy watching for handsome peasant girls and rich merchants who could be bullied to notice workmen or dusty travelers , even one tall wayfarer whose worn cloak could not conceal the hard lines of his powerful frame . This man carried himself with an erect , aggressive bearing g that was too natural for him to realize it himself , much less dissemble it . A great patch covered one eye , and his leather coif , drawn low over his brows , shadowed his features . With a long thick staff in his muscular brown hand , he strode leisurely through the arch where the torches flared and guttered , and , ignored by the tipsy guardsmen , emerged upon the wide streets of Tarantia . Upon these well-lighted thoroughfares the usual throngs went about their business , and shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread ran a constant theme through the pattern . Nemedian soldiers , singly or in clumps , swaggered through the throngs , shouldering their way with studied arrogance . Women scurried from their path , and men stepped aside with darkened brows and clenched fists . The Aquilonians were a proud race , and these were their hereditary enemies . The knuckles of the tall traveler knotted on his staff , but , like the others , he stepped aside to let the men in armor have the way . Among the motley and varied crowd he did not attract much attentionin his drab , dusty garments . But once , as he passed a sword-seller 's stall and the light that streamed from its wide door fell full upon him , he thought he felt an intense stare upon him , and turning quickly , saw a man in the brown jerkin of a freeworkman regarding him fixedly . This man turned away with undue haste , and vanished in the shifting throng . But Conan turned into a narrow bystreet and quickened his pace . It might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The grim Iron Tower stood apart from the citadel , amid a mazep85of narrow streets and crowding houses where the meaner structures , appropriating a space from which the more fastidious shrank , had invaded a portion of the city ordinarily alien to them . The Tower was in reality a castle , an ancient , formidable pile of heavy stone and black iron , which had itself served as the citadel in an earlier , ruder century . Not a long distance from it , lost in a tangle of partly deserted tenements and warehouses , stood an ancient watchtower , so old and forgotten that it did not appear on the maps of the city for a hundred years back . Its original purpose had been forgotten , and nobody , of such as saw it at all , noticed that the apparently ancientlock which kept it from being appropriated as sleepingquartersby beggars and thieves , was in reality comparatively new and extremely powerful , cunningly disguised into an appearance of rusty antiquity . Not half a dozen men in the kingdom had ever known the secret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green-crusted lock . But Conan 's practised fingers , stealing over it , pressed here and there knobs invisible to the casual eye . The door silently opened inward and he entered solid blackness , pushing the door shut behind him . A light would have showed the tower empty , a bare , cylindrical shaft of massive stone . Groping in a corner with the sureness of familiarity , he found the projections for which he was feeling on a slab of the stone that composed the floor . Quickly he lifted it , and without hesitation lowered himself into the aperture beneath . His feet felt stone steps leading downward into what he knew was a narrow tunnel that ran straight toward the foundations of the Iron Tower , three streets away . The Bell on the citadel , which tolled only at the midnight hour or for the death of a king , boomed suddenly . In a dimly lighted chamber in the Iron Tower a door opened and a form emerged into a corridor . The interior of the Tower was as forbidding as its external appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flags of the floor were worn deep by generations of faltering feet , and the vault of the ceiling was gloomy in the dim light of torches set in niches . The man who trudged down that grim corridor was in appearance in keeping with his surroundings . He was a tall , powerfullybuiltman , clad in close-fitting black silk . Over his head was drawnp86a black hood which fell about his shoulders , having two holes for his eyes . From his shoulders hung a loose black cloak , and over one shoulder he bore a heavy ax , the shape of which was that of neither tool nor weapon . As he went down the corridor , a figure came hobbling up it , a bent , surly old man , stooping under the weight of his pike and a lantern he bore in one hand . " You are not as prompt as your predecessor , master headsman , " he grumbled . " Midnight has just struck , and masked men have gone to milady 's cell . They await you . " " The tones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executioner . " If I am not so quick to leap and run at the beck of Aquilonians as was the dog who held this office before me , they shall find my arm no less ready . Get you to your duties , old watchman , and leave me to mine . I think mine is the sweeter trade , by Mitra , for you tramp cold corridors and peer at rusty dungeon doors , while I lop off the fairest head in Tarantia this night . The watchman limped on down the corridor , still grumbling , and the headsman resumed his leisurely way . A few strides carried him around a turn in the corridor , and he absently noted that at his left a door stood partly open . If he had thought , he would have known that that door had been opened since the watchman passed ; but thinking was not his trade . He was passing the unlocked door before he realized that aught was amiss , and then it was too late . A soft tigerish step and the rustle of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy arm hooked about his throat from behind , crushing the cry before it could reach his lips . In the brief instant that was allowed him he realized with a surge of panic the strength of his attacker , against which his own brawny thews were helpless . He sensed without seeing the poised dagger . " Nemedian dog ! " muttered a voice thick with passion in his ear . " You 've cut off your last Aquilonian head ! " And that was the last thing he ever heard . In a dank dungeon , lighted only by a guttering torch , three men stood about a young woman who knelt on the rush-strewn flags staring wildly up at them . She was clad only in a scanty shift ; herp87golden hair fell in lustrous ripples about her white shoulders , and her wrists were bound behind her . Even in the uncertain torchlight , and in spite of her disheveled condition and pallor of fear , her beauty was striking . She knelt mutely , staring with wide eyes up at her tormentors . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this needed masks , even in a conquered land . She knew them all nevertheless ; but what she knew would harm no one  --  after that night . " Our merciful sovereign offers you one more chance , Countess , " said the tallest of the three , and he spoke Aquilonian without an accent . " He bids me say that if you soften your proud , rebelliousI spirit , he will still open his arms to you . If not  --  " he gestured toward a grim wooden block in the center of the cell . It was blackly stained , and showed many deep nicks as if a keen edge , cutting through some yielding substance , had sunk into the wood . Albiona shuddered and turned pale , shrinking back . Every fiber in her vigorous young body quivered with the urge of life . Valerius was young , too , and handsome . Many women loved him , she told herself , fighting with herself for life . But she could not speak the word that would ransom her soft young body from the block and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She only knew that when she thought of the clasp of Valerius 's arms , her flesh crawled with an abhorrence greater than the fear of death . She shook her head helplessly , compelled by an impulsion more irresistible than the instinct to live . " Then there is no more to be said ! " exclaimed one of the others impatiently , and he spoke with a Nemedian accent . " Where is the headsman ? " As if summoned by the word , the dungeon door opened silently , and a great figure stood framed in it , like a black shadow from the underworld . Albiona voiced a low , involuntary cry at the sight of that grim shape , and the others stared silently for a moment , perhaps themselvesdaunted with superstitious awe at the silent , hooded figure . Through the coif the eyes blazed like coals of blue fire , and as these eyes rested on each man in turn , he felt a curious chill travel down his spine . Then the tall Aquilonian roughly seized the girl and dragged her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frantic with terror , but he ruthlessly forcedp88her to her knees , and bent her yellow head down to the bloody block . " Why do you delay , headsman ? " he exclaimed angrily . " Performyour task ! " He was answered by a short , gusty boom of laughter that was indescribably menacing . All in the dungeon froze in their places , staring at the hooded shape  --  the two cloaked figures , the masked man bending over the girl , the girl herself on her knees , twisting her imprisoned head to look upward . " What means this unseemly mirth , dog ? " demanded the Aquilonianuneasily . The man in the black garb tore his hood from his head and flung it to the ground ; he set his back to the closed door and lifted the headsman 's ax . " Do you know me , dogs ? " he rumbled . " Do you know me ? " The breathless silence was broken by a scream . " The king ! " shrieked Albiona , wrenching herself free from the slackened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king ! " The three men stood like statues , and then the Aquilonian started and spoke , like a man who doubts his own senses . " Conan ! " he ejaculated . " It is the king , or his ghost ! What devil 's work is this ? " " Devil 's work to match devils ! " mocked Conan , his lips laughingbut hell flaming in his eyes . " Come , fall to , my gentlemen . You have your swords , and I this cleaver . Nay , I think this butcher 's tool fits the work at hand , my fair lords ! " " At him ! " muttered the Aquilonian , drawing his sword . " It is Conan and we must kill or be killed ! " And like men waking from a trance , the Nemedians drew their blades and rushed on the king . The headsman 's ax was not made for such work , but the king wielded the heavy , clumsy weapon as lightly as a hatchet , and his quickness of foot , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all three at once . He caught the sword of the first man on his ax-head and crushed in the wielder 's breast with a murderous counterstroke before he could step back or parry . The remaining Nemedian , missinga savage swipe , had his brains dashed out before he could recover his balance , and an instant later the Aquilonian was backed into a corner , desperately parrying the crashing strokesp89that rained about him , lacking opportunity even to scream for help . Suddenly Conan 's long left arm shot out and ripped the mask from the man 's head , disclosing the pallid features . " Dog ! " grated the king . " I thought I knew you . Traitor ! Damned renegade ! Even this base steel is too honorable for your foul head . Nay , die as thieves die ! " The ax fell in a devastating arc , and the Aquilonian cried out and went to his knees , grasping the severed stump of his right arm from which blood spouted . It had been shorn away at the elbow , and the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , so that his entrails bulged out . " Lie there and bleed to death , " grunted Conan , casting the ax away disgustedly . " Come , Countess ! " Stooping , he slashed the cords that bound her wrists and lifting her as if she had been a child , strode from the dungeon . She was sobbing hysterically , with her arms thrown about his corded neck in a frenzied embrace . " Easy all , " he muttered . " We 're not out of this yet . If we can reach the dungeon where the secret door opens on stairs that lead to the tunnel  --  devil take it , they 've heard that noise , even through these walls . " Down the corridor arms clanged and the tramp and shouting of men echoed under the vaulted roof . A bent figure came hobbling swiftly along , lantern held high , and its light shone full on Conan and the girl . With a curse the Cimmerian sprang toward him , but the old watchman , abandoning both lantern and pike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of his cracked voice . Deeper shouts answered him . Conan turned swiftly and ran the other way . He was cut off from the dungeon with the secret lock and the hidden door through which he had entered the Tower , and by which he had hoped to leave , but he knew this grim building well . Before he was king he had been imprisoned in it . He turned off into a side passage and quickly emerged into another , broader corridor , which ran parallel to the one down which he had come , and which was at the moment deserted . He followed this only a few yards , when he again turned back , down another side passage . This brought him back into the corridor he had left , but at a strategic point . A few feet farther up the corridor therep90was a heavy bolted door , and before it stood a bearded Nemedian in corselet and helmet his back to Conan as he peered up the corridorin the direction of the growing tumult and wildly waving lanterns . Conan did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran at the guard swiftly and silently , sword in hand . The man turned just as the king reached him , bawled in surprize and fright and lifted his pike ; but before he could bring the clumsy weapon into play , Conan brought down his sword on the fellow 's helmet with a force that would have felled an ox . Helmet and skull gave way togetherand the guard crumpled to the floor . In an instant Conan had drawn the massive bolt that barred the door  --  too heavy for one ordinary man to have manipulated  --  and called hastily to Albiona , who ran staggering to him . Catching her up unceremoniously with one arm , he bore her through the door and into the outer darkness . They had come into a narrow alley , black as pitch , walled by the side of the Tower on one hand , and the sheer stone back of a row of buildings on the other . Conan , hurrying through the darknessas swiftly as he dared , felt the latter wall for doors or windows , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and men poured out , with torches gleaming on breastplates and naked swords . They glared about , bellowing , unable to penetrate the darkness which their torches served to illuminate for only a few feet in any direction , and then rushed down the alley at random  --  heading in the direction opposite to that taken by Conan and Albiona . " They 'll learn their mistake quick enough , " he muttered , increasinghis pace . If we ever find a crack in this infernal wall  --  damn ! The street watch ! " Ahead of them a faint glow became apparent , where the alley opened into a narrow street , and he saw dim figures looming against it with a glimmer of steel . It was indeed the street watch , investigating the noise they had heard echoing down the alley . " Who goes here ? " they shouted , and Conan grit his teeth at the hated Nemedian accent . " Keep behind me , " he ordered the girl . " We 've got to cut our way through before the prison guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sword , he ran straight at the oncoming figures.  |p91The  advantage of surprize was his . He could see them , limned against the distant glow , and they could not see him coming at them out of the black depths of the alley . He was among them before they knew it , smiting with the silent fury of a wounded lion . His one chance lay in hacking through before they could gather their wits . But there were half a score of them , in full mail , hardbittenveterans of the border wars , in whom the instinct for battle could take the place of bemused wits . Three of them were down before they realized that it was only one man who was attacking them , but even so their reaction was instantaneous . The clangor of steel rose deafeningly , and sparks flew as Conan 's sword crashed on basinet and hauberk . He could see better than they , and in the dim light his swiftly moving figure was an uncertain mark . Flailing swords cut empty air or glanced from his blade , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty of a hurricane . But behind him sounded the shouts of the prison guards , returningup the alley at a run , and still the mailed figures before him barred his way with a bristling wall of steel . In an instant the guards would be on his back  --  in desperation he redoubled his strokes , flailing like a smith on an anvil , and then was suddenly aware of a diversion . Out of nowhere behind the watchmen rose a score of black figures and there was a sound of blows , murderouslydriven . Steel glinted in the gloom , and men cried out , struck mortally from behind . In an instant the alley was littered with writhing forms . A dark , cloaked shape sprang toward Conan , who heaved up his sword , catching a gleam of steel in the right hand . But the other was extended to him empty and a voice hissed urgently : " This way , your Majesty ! Quickly ! " With a muttered oath of surprize , Conan caught up Albiona in one massive arm , and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with thirty prison guardsmen closing in behind him . Surrounded by mysterious figures he hurried down the alley , carrying the countess as if she had been a child . He could tell nothing of his rescuers except that they wore dark cloaks and hoods . Doubt and suspicion crossed his mind , but at least they had struck down his enemies , and he saw no better course than to follow them . As if sensing his doubt , the leader touched his arm lightly and said : " Fear not , King Conan ; we are your loyal subjects . " Thep92voice was not familiar , but the accent was Aquilonian of the centralprovinces . Behind them the guards were yelling as they stumbled over the shambles in the mud , and they came pelting vengefully down the alley , seeing the vague dark mass moving between them and the light of the distant street . But the hooded men turned suddenly toward the seemingly blank wall , and Conan saw a door gape there . He muttered a curse . He had traversed that alley by day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . But through it they went , and the door closed behind them with the click of a lock . The sound was not reassuring , but his guides were hurrying him on , moving with the precision of familiarity , guiding Conan with a hand at either elbow . It was like traversing a tunnel , and Conan felt Albiona 's lithe limbs trembling in his arms . Then somewhere ahead of them an opening was faintly visible , merely a somewhat less black arch in the blackness , and through this they filed . After that there was a bewildering succession of dim courts and shadowy alleys and winding corridors , all traversed in utter silence , until at last they emerged into a broad lighted chamber , the location of which Conan could not even guess , for their devious route had confused even his primitive sense of direction.  |p93NOT  ALL HIS guides entered the chamber . When the door closed , Conan saw only one man standing before him  --  a slim figure , masked in a black cloak with a hood . This the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with calm , delicately chiseled features . The king set Albiona on her feet , but she still clung to him and stared apprehensively about her . The chamber was a large one , with marble walls partly covered with black velvet hangings and thick rich carpets on the mosaic floor , laved in the soft golden glow of bronze lamps . Conan instinctively laid a hand on his hilt . There was blood on his hand , blood clotted about the mouth of his scabbard , for he had sheathed his blade without cleansing it . " Where are we ? " he demanded . The stranger answered with a low , profound bow in which the suspicious king could detect no trace of irony . " In the temple of Asura , your Majesty . " Albiona cried out faintly and clung closer to Conan , staring fearfully at the black , arched doors , as if expecting the entry of some grisly shape of darkness . " Fear not , my lady , " said their guide . " There is nothing here to harm you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently convinced of the innocence of our religion to protectus from the persecution of the ignorant , then certainly one of his subjects need have no apprehensions . " " Who are you ? " demanded Conan . " I am Hadrathus , priest of Asura . One of my followers recognized you when you entered the city , and brought the word to me . " Conan grunted profanely . " Do not fear that others discovered your identity , " Hadrathus assured him . " Your disguise would have deceived any but a followerof Asura , whose cult it is to seek below the aspect of illusion . You were followed to the watch tower , and some of my peoplewent into the tunnel to aid you if you returned by that route . Others , myself among them , surrounded the tower . And now , King Conan , it is yours to command . Here in the temple of Asura you are still king . "  | " Why should you risk your lives for me ? " asked the king . " You were our friend when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You protected us when the priests of Mitra sought to scourge us out of the land . " Conan looked about him curiously . He had never before visited the temple of Asura , had not certainly known that there was such a temple in Tarantia . The priests of the religion had a habit of hiding their temples in a remarkable fashion . The worship of Mitra was overwhelmingly predominant in the Hyborian nations , but the cult of Asura persisted , in spite of official ban and popular antagonism . Conan had been told dark tales of hidden temples where intense smoke drifted up incessantly from black altars where kidnaped humans were sacrificed before a great coiled serpent , whose fearsome head swayed for ever in the haunted shadows . Persecution caused the followers of Asura to hide their temples with cunning art , and to veil their rituals in obscurity ; and this secrecy , in turn , evoked more monstrous suspicions and tales of evil . But Conan 's was the broad tolerance of the barbarian , and he had refused to persecute the followers of Asura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better evidence than was presented against them , rumors and accusations that could not be proven . " If they are black magicians , " he had said , " how will they suffer you to harry them ? If they are not , there is no evil in them . Crom 's devils ! Let men worship what gods they will . " At a respectful invitation from Hadrathus he seated himself on an ivory chair , and motioned Albiona to another , but she preferred to sit on a golden stool at his feet , pressing close against his thigh , as if seeking security in the contact . Like most orthodox followersof Mitra , she had an intuitive horror of the followers and cult of Asura , instilled in her infancy and childhood by wild tales of human sacrifice and anthropomorphic gods shambling through shadowy temples . Hadrathus stood before them , his uncovered head bowed . " What is your wish , your Majesty ? " " Food first , " he grunted , and the priest smote a golden gong with a silver wand . Scarcely had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a curtained doorway bearing a great four-legged silver platter of smoking dishes and crystal vessels.  |p95This  they set before Conan , bowing low , and the king wiped his hands on the damask , and smacked his lips with unconcealed relish . " Beware , your Majesty ! " whispered Albiona . " These folk eat human flesh ! " " I 'll stake my kingdom that this is nothing but honest roast beef , " answered Conan . " Come , lass , fall to ! You must be hungry after the prison fare . " Thus advised , and with the example before her of one whose word was the ultimate law to her , the countess complied , and ate ravenously though daintily , while her liege lord tore into the meat joints and guzzled the wine with as much gusto as if he had not alreadyeaten once that night . " You priests are shrewd , Hadrathus , " he said , with a great beefbonein his hands and his mouth full of meat . " I 'd welcome your service in my campaign to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Conan slammed the beef-bone down on the table in a gust of impatient wrath . " Crom 's devils ! What ails the men of Aquilonia ? First Servius now you ! Can you do nothing but wag your idiotic heads when I speak of ousting these dogs ? " Hadrathus sighed and answered slowly : " My lord , it is ill to say , and I fain would say otherwise . But the freedom of Aquilonia is at an end ! Nay , the freedom of the whole world may be at an end ! Age follows age in the history of the world , and now we enter an age of horror and slavery , as it was long ago . " " What do you mean ? " demanded the king uneasily . Hadrathus dropped into a chair and rested his elbows on his thighs , staring at the floor . " It is not alone the rebellious lords of Aquilonia and the armies of Nemedia which are arrayed against you , " answered Hadrathus . " It is sorcery  --  grisly black magic from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risen out of the shades of the Past , and none can stand before it . " " What do you mean ? " Conan repeated . " I speak of Xaltotun of Acheron , who died three thousand years ago , yet walks the earth today . " Conan was silent , while in his mind floated an image  --  the image of a bearded face of calm inhuman beauty . Again he was haunted by a sense of uneasy familiarity . Acheron  --  the sound ofp96the word roused instinctive vibrations of memory and associations in his mind . " Acheron , " he repeated . " Xaltotun of Acheron  --  man , are you mad ? Acheron has been a myth for more centuries than I can remember . I 've often wondered if it ever existed at all . " " It was a black reality , " answered Hadrathus , " an empire of black magicians , steeped in evil now long forgotten . It was finally overthrown by the Hyborian tribes of the west . The wizards of Acheron practised foul necromancy , thaumaturgy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of all the sorcerers of that accursed kingdom , none was so great as Xaltotun of Py-thon . " " Then how was he ever overthrown ? " asked Conan skeptically . " By some means a source of cosmic power which he jealously guarded was stolen and turned against him . That source has been returned to him , and he is invincible " Albiona , hugging the headsman 's black cloak about her , stared from the priest to the king , not understanding the conversation . Conan shook his head angrily . " You are making game of me , " he growled . " If Xaltotun has been dead three thousand years , how can this man be he ? It 's some rogue who 's taken the old one 's name . " Hadrathus leaned to an ivory table and opened a small gold chest which stood there . From it he took something which glinted dully in the mellow light  --  a broad gold coin of antique minting . " You have seen Xaltotun unveiled ? Then look upon this . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fall . So pervaded with sorcery was that black empire , that even this coin has its uses in making magic . " Conan took it and scowled down at it . There was no mistaking its great antiquity . Conan had handled many coins in the years of his plunderings , and had a good practical knowledge of them . The edges were worn and the inscription almost obliterated . But the countenance stamped on one side was still clear-cut and distinct . And Conan 's breath sucked in between his clenched teeth . It was not cool in the chamber , but he felt a prickling of his scalp , an icy contraction of his flesh . The countenance was that of a bearded man , inscrutable , with a calm inhuman beauty . " By Crom ! It 's he ! " muttered Conan . He understood , now , the sense of familiarity that the sight of the bearded man had rousedp97in him from the first . He had seen a coin like this once before , long ago in a far land . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a coincidence  --  or if he 's shrewd enough to assume a forgotten wizard 's name , he 's shrewd enough to assume his likeness . " But he spoke without conviction . The sight of that coin had shaken the foundations of his universe . He felt that reality and stability were crumbling into an abyss of illusion and sorcery . A wizard was understandable ; but this was diabolism beyond sanity . " We can not doubt that it is indeed Xaltotun of Python , " said Hadrathus . " He it was who shook down the cliffs at Valkia , by his spells that enthrall the elementals of the earth  --  he it was who sent the creature of darkness into your tent before dawn . " Conan scowled at him . " How did you know that ? " " The followers of Asura have secret channels of knowledge . That does not matter . But do you realize the futility of sacrificing your subjects in a vain attempt to regain your crown ? " Conan rested his chin on his fist , and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind groping bewildered in the mazes of the problem that confronted him . " Is there no wizard in the world who could make magic to fight Xaltotun 's magic ? " he asked at last . Hadrathus shook his head . " If there were , we of Asura would know of him . Men say our cult is a survival of the ancient Stygian serpent-worship . That is a lie . Our ancestors came from Vendhya , beyond the Sea of Vilayet and the blue Himelian mountains . We are sons of the East , not the South , and we have knowledge of all the wizards of the East , who are greater than the wizards of the West . And not one of them but would be a straw in the wind before the black might of Xaltotun . " " But he was conquered once , " persisted Conan . " Aye ; a cosmic source was turned against him . But now that source is again in his hands , and he will see that it is not stolen again . " " And what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is called the Heart of Ahriman . When Acheron was overthrown , the primitive priest who had stolen it and turned it against Xaltotun hid it in a haunted cavern and built a small templeover the cavern . Thrice thereafter the temple was rebuilt , eachp98time greater and more elaborately than before , but always on the site of the original shrine , though men forgot the reason therefor . Memory of the hidden symbol faded from the minds of common men , and was preserved only in priestly books and esoteric volumes . Whence it came no one knows . Some say it is the veritable heart of a god , others that it is a star that fell from the skies long ago . Until it was stolen , none had looked upon it for three thousand years . " When the magic of the Mitran priests failed against the magic of Xaltotun 's acolyte , Altaro , they remembered the ancient legend of the Heart , and the high priest and an acolyte went down into the dark and terrible crypt below the temple into which no priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironboundvolumes which speak of the Heart in their cryptic symbolism , it is also told of a creature of darkness left by the ancient priest to guard it . " Far down in a square chamber with arched doorways leading off into immeasurable blackness , the priest and his acolytes found a black stone altar that glowed dimly with inexplicable radiance . " On that altar lay a curious gold vessel like a double-valved sea-shell which clung to the stone like a barnacle . But it gaped open and empty . The Heart of Ahriman was gone . While they stared in horror , the keeper of the crypt , the creature of darkness , came upon them and mangled the high priest so that he died . But the acolyte fought off the being  --  a mindless , soulless waif of the pits brought long ago to guard the Heart  --  and escaped up the long black narrow stairs carrying the dying priest , who before he died , gasped out the news to his followers , bade them submit to a power they could not overcome , and commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the priests , and we of Asura learned of it . " " And Xaltotun draws his power from this symbol ? " asked Conan , still skeptical . " No . His power is drawn from the black gulf . But the Heart of Ahriman came from some far universe of flaming light , and against it the powers of darkness can not stand , when it is in the hands of an adept . It is like a sword that might smite at him , not a sword with which he can smite . It restores life , and can destroy life . He has stolen it , not to use it against his enemies , but to keep them from using it against him . "  | " A shell-shaped bowl of gold on a black altar in a deep cavern , " Conan muttered , frowning as he sought to capture the illusive image . " That reminds me of something I have heard or seen . But what , in Crom 's name , is this notable Heart ? " " It is in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsing with blinding fire with which no ruby ever burned . It glows like living flame- " But Conan sprang suddenly up and smote his right fist into his left palm like a thunderclap . " Crom ! " he roared . " What a fool I 've been ! The Heart of Ahriman ! The heart of my kingdom ! Find the heart of my kingdom , Zelata said . By Ymir , it was the jewel I saw in the green smoke , the jewel which Tarascus stole from Xaltotun while he lay in the sleep of the black lotus ! " Hadrathus was also on his feet , his calm dropped from him like a garment . " What are you saying ? The Heart stolen from Xaltotun ? " " Aye ! " Conan boomed . " Tarascus feared Xaltotun and wanted to cripple his power , which he thought resided in the Heart . Maybe he thought the wizard would die if the Heart was lost . By Crom  --  ahhh ! " With a savage grimace of disappointment and disgusthe dropped his clenched hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a thief to throw into the sea . By this time the fellow must be almost to Kordava . Before I can followhim he 'll take ship and consign the Heart to the bottom of the ocean . " " The sea will not hold it ! " exclaimed Hadrathus , quivering with excitement . " Xaltotun would himself have cast it into the ocean long ago , had he not known that the first storm would carry it ashore . But on what unknown beach might it not land ! " " Well , " Conan was recovering some of his resilient confidence , " there 's no assurance that the thief will throw it away . If I know thieves  --  and I should , for I was a thief in Zamora in my early youth  --  he wo n't throw it away . He 'll sell it to some rich trader . By Crom ! " He strode back and forth in his growing excitement . " It 's worth looking for ! Zelata bade me find the heart of my kingdom , and all else she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the power to conquer Xaltotun lurks in that crimson bauble ? " " Aye ! My head upon it ! " cried Hadrathus , his face lightened with fervor , his eyes blazing , his fists clenched . " With it in ourp100hands we can dare the powers of Xaltotun ! I swear it ! If we can recover it , we have an even chance of recovering your crown and driving the invaders from our portals . It is not the swords of Nemedia that Aquilonia fears , but the black arts of Xaltotun . " Conan looked at him for a space , impressed by the priest 's fire . " It 's like a quest in a nightmare , " he said at last . " Yet your words echo the thought of Zelata , and all else she said was truth . I 'll seek for this jewel . " " It holds the destiny of Aquilonia , " said Hadrathus with conviction . " I will send men with you  --  " " Nay ! " exclaimed the king impatiently , not caring to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts . " This is a task for a fighting-man . I go alone . First to Poitain , where I 'll leave Albiona with Trocero . Then to Kordava , and to the sea beyond , if necessary . It may be that , even if the thief intendscarrying out Tarascus 's order , he 'll have some difficulty finding an outbound ship at this time of the year . " " And if you find the Heart , " cried Hadrathus , " I will prepare the way for your conquest . Before you return to Aquilonia I will spread the word through secret channels that you live and are returning with a magic stronger than Xaltotun 's . I will have men ready to rise on your return . They will rise , if they have assurance that they will be protected from the black arts of Xaltotun . " And I will aid you on your journey . " He rose and struck the gong . " A secret tunnel leads from beneath this temple to a place outside the city wall . You shall go to Poitain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " As you will . " With a definite purpose in mind Conan was afire with impatience and dynamic energy . " Only let it be done swiftly . " In the meantime events were moving not slowly elsewhere in the city . A breathless messenger had burst into the palace where Valerius was amusing himself with his dancing-girls , and throwing himself on his knee , gasped out a garbled story of a bloody prison break and the escape of a lovely captive . He bore also the news that Count Thespius , to whom the execution of Albiona 's sentence had been entrusted , was dying and begging for a word with Valerius before he passed.  |p101Hurriedly  cloaking himself , Valerius accompanied the man through various winding ways , and came to a chamber where Thespius lay . There was no doubt that the count was dying ; bloody froth bubbled from his lips at each shuddering gasp . His severed arm had been bound to stop the flow of blood , but even without that , the gash in his side was mortal . Alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By Mitra , I had believed that only one man ever lived who could strike such a blow . " " Valerius ! " gasped the dying man . " He lives ! Conan lives ! " " What are you saying ? " ejaculated the other . " I swear by Mitra ! " gurgled Thespius , gagging on the blood that gushed to his lips . " It was he who carried off Albiona ! He is not dead  --  no phantom come back from hell to haunt us . He is flesh and blood , and more terrible than ever . The alley behind the tower is full of dead men . Beware , Valerius  --  he has come back  --  to slay us all " A strong shudder shook the blood-smeared figure , and Count Thespius went limp . Valerius frowned down at the dead man , cast a swift glance about the empty chamber , and stepping swiftly to the door , cast it open suddenly . The messenger and a group of Nemedian guardsmenstood several paces down the corridor . Valerius muttered something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates been closed ? " he demanded . " Yes , your Majesty . " " Triple the guards at each . Let no one enter or leave the city without strictest investigation . Set men scouring the streets and searching the quarters . A very valuable prisoner has escaped , with the aid of an Aquilonian rebel . Did any of you recognize the man ? " " No , your Majesty . The old watchman had a glimpse of him , but could only say that he was a giant , clad in the black garb of the executioner , whose naked body we found in an empty cell . " " He is a dangerous man , " said Valerius . " Take no chances with him . You all know the Countess Albiona . Search for her , and if you find her , kill her and her companion instantly . Do not try to take them alive . " Returning to his palace chamber , Valerius summoned beforep102him four men of curious and alien aspect . They were tall , gaunt , of yellowish skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clad alike in long black robes beneath which their sandaled feet were just visible . Their features were shadowed by their hoods . They stood before Valerius with their hands in their wide sleeves ; their arms folded . Valerius looked at them without pleasure . In his far journeyings he had encountered many strange races . " When I found you starving in the Khitan jungles , " he said abruptly , " exiles from your kingdom , you swore to serve me . You have served me well enough , in your abominable way . One more service I require , and then I set you free of your oath . " Conan the Cimmerian , king of Aquilonia , still lives , in spite of Xaltotun 's sorcery  --  or perhaps because of it . I know not . The dark mind of that resurrected devil is too devious and subtle for a mortal man to fathom . But while Conan lives I am not safe . The people accepted me as the lesser of two evils , when they thought he was dead . Let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revolution before I can lift my hand . " Perhaps my allies mean to use him to replace me , if they decideI have served my purpose . I do not know . I do know that this planet is too small for two kings of Aquilonia . Seek the Cimmerian . Use your uncanny talents to ferret him out wherever he hides or runs . He has many friends in Tarantia . He had aid when he carried off Albiona . It took more than one man , even such a man as Conan , to wreak all that slaughter in the alley outside the tower . But no more . Take your staffs and strike his trail . Where that trail will lead you , I know not . But find him ! And when you find him , slay him ! " The four Khitans bowed together , and still unspeaking , turned and padded noiselessly from the chamber.  |p103DAWN  THAT ROSE over the distant hills shone on the sails of a small craft that dropped down the river which curves to within a mile of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining serpent . This boat differed from the ordinary craft plying the broad Khorotas  --  fishermen and merchant barges loaded with rich goods . It was long and slender , with a high , curving prow , and was black as ebony , with white skulls painted along the gunwales . Amidships rose a small cabin , the windows closely masked . Other craft gave the ominously painted boat a wide berth ; for it was obviously one of those " pilgrim boats " that carried a lifeless follower of Asura on his last mysterious pilgrimage southward to where , far beyond the Poitanian mountains , a river flowed at last into the blue ocean . In that cabin undoubtedly lay the corpse of the departed worshipper . All men were familiar with the sight of those gloomy craft ; and the most fanatical votary of Mitra would not dare touch or interfere with their somber voyages . Where the ultimate destination lay , men did not know . Some said Stygia ; some a nameless island lying beyond the horizon ; others said it was in the glamorous and mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But none knew certainly . They only knew that when a follower of Asura died , the corpse went southward down the great river , in a black boat rowed by a giant slave , and neither boat nor corpse nor slave was ever seen again ; unless , indeed , certain dark tales were true , and it was always the same slave who rowed the boats southward . The man who propelled this particular boat was as huge and brown as the others , though closer scrutiny might have revealed the fact that the hue was the result of carefully applied pigments . He was clad in leather loin-clout and sandals , and he handled the long sweep and oars with unusual skill and power . But none approached the grim boat closely , for it was well known that the followers of Asura were accursed , and that these pilgrim boats were loaded with dark magic . So men swung their boats wide and muttered an incantation as the dark craft slid past , and they never dreamed that they were thus assisting in the flight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange journey , in that black , slim craft down the great river for nearly two hundred miles to where the Khorotas swingsp104eastward , skirting the Poitanian mountains . Like a dream the ever-changing panorama glided past . During the day Albiona lay patiently in the little cabin , as quietly as the corpse she pretended to be . Only late at night , after the pleasure boats with their fair occupantslounging on silken cushions in the flare of torches held by slaves had left the river , before dawn brought the hurrying fisherboats , did the girl venture out . Then she held the long sweep , cunninglybound in place by ropes to aid her , while Conan snatched a few hours of sleep . But the king needed little rest . The fire of his desire drove him relentlessly ; and his powerful frame was equal to the grinding test . Without halt or pause they drove southward . So down the river they fled , through nights when the flowing current mirrored the million stars , and through days of golden sunlight , leaving winter behind them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , above which throbbed and pulsed the reflection of the myriad lights , lordly river villas and fertile groves . So at last the blue mountains of Poitain rose above them , tier above tier , like ramparts of the gods , and the great river , swerving from those turreted cliffs , swept thunderously through the marching hills with many a rapid and foaming cataract . Conan scanned the shore-line closely , and finally swung the long sweep and headed inshore at a point where a neck of land jutted into the water , and fir trees grew in a curiously symmetrical ring about a gray , strangely shaped rock . " How these boats ride those falls we hear roaring ahead of us is more than I can see , " he grunted . " Hadrathus said they did but here 's where we halt . He said a man would be waiting for us with horses , but I do n't see anyone . How word of our coming could have preceded us I do n't know anyway . " He drove inshore and bound the prow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plunging into the water , washed the brown paint from his skin and emerged dripping , and in his natural color . From the cabin he brought forth a suit of Aquilonian ringmailwhich Hadrathus had procured for him , and his sword . These he donned while Albiona put on garments suitable for mountain travel . And when Conan was fully armed , and turned to look toward the shore , he started and his hand went to his sword . For on the shore , under the trees , stood a black-cloaked figure holding the reins of a white palfrey and a bay war-horse.  | " Who are you ? " demanded the king . The other bowed low . " A follower of Asura . A command came . I obeyed . " " How , came ' ? " inquired Conan , but the other merely bowed again . " I have come to guide you through the mountains to the first Poitanian stronghold . " " I do n't need a guide , " answered Conan . " I know these hills well . I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will attract less attention alone than if we were accompanied by an acolyte of Asura . " The man bowed profoundly , and giving the reins into Conan 's hands , stepped into the boat . Casting off , he floated down the swift current , toward the distant roar of the unseen rapids . With a baffled shake of his head , Conan lifted the countess into the palfrey 's saddle , and then mounted the war-horse and reined toward the summits that castellated the sky . The rolling country at the foot of the towering mountains were now a borderland , in a state of turmoil , where the barons reverted to feudal practises , and bands of outlaws roamed unhindered . Poitainhad not formally declared her separation from Aquilonia , but she was now , to all intents , a self-contained kingdom , ruled by her hereditary count , Trocero . The rolling south country had submittednominally to Valerius , but he had not attempted to force the passes guarded by strongholds where the crimson leopard banner of Poitain waved defiantly . The king and his fair companion rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they mounted higher , the rolling country spread out like a vast purple mantle far beneath them , shot with the shine of rivers and lakes , the yellow glint of broad fields , and the white gleam of distant towers . Ahead of them and far above , they glimpsed the first of the Poitanian holds  --  a strong fortress dominating a narrow pass , the crimson banner streaming against the clear blue sky . Before they reached it , a band of knights in burnished armor rode from among the trees , and their leader sternly ordered the travelers to halt . They were tall men , with the dark eyes and raven locks of the south . " Halt , sir , and state your business , and why you ride toward Poitain. "  | " Is Poitain in revolt then , " asked Conan , watching the other closely , " that a man in Aquilonian harness is halted and questionedlike a foreigner ? " " Many rogues ride out of Aquilonia these days , " answered the other coldly . " As for revolt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poitain is in revolt . We had rather serve the memory of a dead man than the scepter of a living dog . " Conan swept off his helmet , and shaking back his black mane stared full at the speaker . The Poitanian stared violently and went livid . " Saints of heaven ! " he gasped . " It is the king  --  alive ! " The others stared wildly , then a roar of wonder and joy burst from them . They swarmed about Conan , shouting their war-cries and brandishing their swords in their extreme emotion . The acclaim , of Poitanian warriors was a thing to terrify a timid man . " Oh , but Trocero will weep tears of joy to see you , sire ! " cried one . " Aye , and Prospero ! " shouted another . " The general has been like one wrapped in a mantle of melancholy , and curses himself night and day that he did not reach the Valkia in time to die beside his king ! " " Now we will strike for empery ! " yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hail , Conan king of Poitain ! " The clangor of bright steel about him and the thunder of their acclaim frightened the birds that rose in gay-hued clouds from the surrounding trees . The hot southern blood was afire , and they desirednothing but for their new-found sovereign to lead them to battle and pillage . " What is your command , sire ? " they cried . " Let one of us ride ahead and bear the news of your coming into Poitain ! Banners will wave from every tower , roses will carpet the road before your horse 's feet , and all the beauty and chivalry of the south will give you the honor due you  --  " Conan shook his head . " Who could doubt your loyalty ? But winds blow over these mountains into the countries of my enemies , and I would rather these did n't know that I lived yet . Take me to Trocero , and keep my identity a secret . " So what the knights would have made a triumphal procession was more in the nature of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , except for a whisper to the captain on duty at each pass ; and Conan rode among them with his vizor lowered . The mountains were uninhabited save by outlaws and garrisons of soldiers who guarded the passes . The pleasure-loving Poitanianshad no need nor desire to wrest a hard and scanty living from their stem breasts . South of the ranges the rich and beautiful plains of Poitain stretched to the river Alimane ; but beyond the river lay the land of Zingara . Even now , when winter was crisping the leaves beyond the mountains , the tall rich grass waved upon the plains where grazed the horses and cattle for which Poitain was famed . Palm trees and orange groves smiled in the sun , and the gorgeous purple and gold and crimson towers of castles and cities reflected the golden light . It was a land of warmth and plenty , of beautiful men and ferociouswarriors . It is not only the hard lands that breed hard men . Poitain was surrounded by covetous neighbors and her sons learned hardihood in incessant wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to the south only the Alimane separatedthe plains of Poitain from the plains of Zingara , and not once but a thousand times had that river run red . To the east lay Argos and beyond that Ophir , proud kingdoms and avaricious . The knights of Poitain held their lands by the weight and edge of their swords , and little of ease and idleness they knew . So Conan came presently to the castle of Count Trocero ... Conan sat on a silken divan in a rich chamber whose filmy curtainsthe warm breeze billowed . Trocero paced the floor like a panther , a lithe , restless man with the waist of a woman and the shoulders of a swordsman , who carried his years lightly . " Let us proclaim you king of Poitain ! " urged the count . " Let those northern pigs wear the yoke to which they have bent their necks . The south is still yours . Dwell here and rule us , amid the flowers and the palms . " But Conan shook his head . " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stand alone , bold as are its sons . " " It did stand alone for generations , " retorted Trocero , with the quick jealous pride of his breed . " We were not always a part of Aquilonia . " " I know . But conditions are not as they were then , when all kingdoms were broken into principalities which warred with eachp108other . The days of dukedoms and free cities are past , the days of empires are upon us . Rulers are dreaming imperial dreams , and only in unity is there strength . " " Then let us unite Zingara with Poitain , " argued Trocero . " Half a dozen princes strive against each other , and the country is torn asunder by civil wars . We will conquer it , province by province , and add it to your dominions . Then with the aid of the Zingarans we will conquer Argos and Ophir . We will build an empire  --  " Again Conan shook his head . " Let others dream imperial dreams . I but wish to hold what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded together by blood and fire . It 's one thing to seize a throne with the aid of its subjects and rule them with their consent . It 's another to subjugate a foreign realm and rule it by fear . I do n't wish to be another Valerius . No , Trocero , I 'll rule all Aquilonia and no more , or I 'll rule nothing . " " Then lead us over the mountains and we will smite the Nemedians . " Conan 's fierce eyes glowed with appreciation . " No , Trocero . It would be a vain sacrifice . I 've told you what I must do to regain my kingdom . I must find the Heart of Ahriman . " " But this is madness ! " protested Trocero . " The maunderings of a heretical priest , the mumblings of a mad witch-woman . " " You were not in my tent before Valkia , " answered Conan grimly , involuntarily glancing at his right wrist , on which blue marks still showed faintly . " You did n't see the cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Trocero , I 've been convinced . Xaltotun 's no mortal man , and only with the Heart of Ahriman can I stand against him . So I 'm riding to Kordava , alone . " " But that is dangerous , " protested Trocero . " Life is dangerous , " rumbled the king . " I wo n't go as king of Aquilonia , or even as a knight of Poitain , but as a wandering mercenary , as I rode in Zingara in the old days . Oh , I have enemies enough south of the Alimane , in the lands and the waters of the south . Many who wo n't know me as king of Aquilonia will remember me as Conan of the Barachan pirates , or Amra of the black corsairs . But I have friends , too , and men who 'll aid me fortheir own private reasons . " A faint reminiscent grin touched his lips . Trocero dropped his hands helplessly and glanced at Albiona , who sat on a near-by divan.  | " I understand your doubts , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the coin in the temple of Asura , and look you , Hadrathus said it was dated five hundred years before the fall of Acheron . If Xaltotun , then , is the man pictured on the coin , as his Majesty swears he is , that means he was no common wizard , even in his other life , for the years of his life were numbered by centuries , not as the lives of other men are numbered . " Before Trocero could reply , a respectful rap was heard on the door and a voice called : " My lord , we have caught a man skulkingabout the castle , who says he wishes to speak with your guest . I await your orders . " " A spy from Aquilonia ! " hissed Trocero , catching at his dagger , but Conan lifted his voice and called : " Open the door and let me see him . " The door was opened and a man was framed in it , grasped on either hand by stern-looking men-at-arms . He was a slender man , clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follower of Asura ? " asked Conan . The man nodded , and the stalwart men-at-arms looked shocked and glanced hesitantly at Trocero . " The word came southward , " said the man . " Beyond the Alimane we can not aid you , for our sect goes no farther southward , but stretches eastward with the Khorotas . But this I have learned : the thief who took the Heart of Ahriman from Tarascus never reached Kordava . In the mountains of Poitain he was slain by robbers . The jewel fell into the hands of their chief , who , not knowing its true nature , and being harried after the destruction of his band by Poitanian knights , sold it to the Kothic merchant Zorathus . " " Ha ! " Conan was on his feet , galvanized . " And what of Zorathus ? " " Four days ago he crossed the Alimane , headed for Argos , with a small band of armed servants . " He 's a fool to cross Zingara in such times , " said Trocero . " Aye , times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold man , and reckless in his way . He is in great haste to reach Messantia , where he hopes to find a buyer for the jewel . Perhaps he hopes to sell it finally in Stygia . Perhaps he guesses at its true nature . At any rate , instead of following the long road that winds along the borders of Poitain and so at last comes into Argos farp110from Messantia , he has struck straight across eastern Zingara , followingthe shorter and more direct route . " Conan smote the table with his clenched fist so that the great board quivered . " Then , by Crom , fortune has at last thrown the dice for me ! A horse , Trocero , and the harness of a Free Companion ! Zorathus has a long start , but not too long for me to overtake him , if I followhim to the end of the world ! "  |p111AT  DAWN CONAN waded his horse across the shallows of the Alimane and struck the wide caravan trail which ran southeastward , and behind him , on the farther bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his steel-clad knights , with the crimson leopard of Poitain floating its long folds over him in the morning breeze . Silently they sat , those dark-haired men in shining steel , until the figure of their king had vanished in the blue of distance that whitened toward sunrise . Conan rode a great black stallion , the gift of Trocero . He no longer wore the armor of Aquilonia . His harness proclaimed him a veteran of the Free Companies , who were of all races . His headpiecewas a plain riorion , dented and battered . The leather and mail-mesh of his hauberk were worn and shiny as if by many campaigns , and the scarlet cloak flowing carelessly from his mailed shoulders was tattered and stained . He looked the part of the hired fighting-man , who had known all vicissitudes of fortune , plunder and wealth one day , an empty purse and a dose-drawn belt the next . And more than looking the part , he felt the part ; the awakening of old memories , the resurge of the wild , mad , glorious days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path when he was a wanderingmercenary , roistering , brawling , guzzling , adventuring , with no thought for the morrow , and no desire save sparkling ale , red lips , and a keen sword to swing on all the battlefields of the world . Unconsciously he reverted to the old ways ; a new swagger becameevident in his bearing , in the way he sat his horse ; half-forgottenoaths rose naturally to his lips , and as he rode he hummed old songs that he had roared in chorus with his reckless companions in many a tavern and on many a dusty road or bloody field . It was an unquiet land through which he rode . The companies of cavalry which usually patrolled the river , alert for raids out of Poitain , were nowhere in evidence . Internal strife had left the bordersunguarded : The long white road stretched bare from horizon to horizon . No laden camel trains or rumbling wagons or lowing herds moved along it now ; only occasional groups of horsemen in leather and steel , hawk-faced , hard-eyed men , who kept together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze butp112rode on , for the solitary rider 's harness promised no plunder , but only hard strokes . Villages lay in ashes and deserted , the fields and meadows idle . Only the boldest would ride the roads these days , and the native population had been decimated in the civil wars , and by raids from across the river . In more peaceful times the road was thronged with merchants riding Poitain to Messantia in Argos , or back . But now these found it wiser to follow the road that led east through Poitain , and then turned south down across Argos . It was longer , but safer . Only an extremely reckless man would risk his life and goods on this road through Zingara . The southern horizon was fringed with flame by night , and in the day straggling pillars of smoke drifted upward ; in the cities and plains to the south men were dying , thrones were toppling and castles going up in flames . Conan felt the old tug of the professionalfighting-man , to turn his horse and plunge into the fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old . Why should he toil to regain the rule of a people which had already forgotten him ?  --  why chase a will-o ' - the- wisp , why pursue a crown that was lost for ever ? Why should he not seek forgetfulness , lose himself in the red tides of war and rapine that had engulfed him so often before ? Could he not , indeed , carve out another kingdom for himself ? The world was entering an age of iron , an age of war and imperialistic ambition ; some strong man might well rise above the ruins of nations as a supreme conqueror . Why should it not be himself ? So his familiar devil whispered in his ear , and the phantomsof his lawless and bloody past crowded upon him . But he did not turn aside ; he rode onward , following a quest that grew dimmer and dimmer as he advanced , until sometimes it seemed that he pursued a dream that never was . He pushed the black stallion as hard as he dared , but the long white road lay before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start Zorathus had , but Conan rode steadily on , knowing that he was traveling faster than the burdened merchants could travel . And so he came to the castle of Count Valbroso , perched like a vulture 's eyrie on a bare hill overlooking the road . Valbroso rode down with his men-at-arms , a lean , dark man with glittering eyes and a predatory beak of a nose . He wore black plate-armor and was followed by thirty spearmen , black-mustachedhawks of the border wars , as avaricious and ruthless asp113himself . Of late the toll of the caravans had been slim , and Valbroso cursed the civil wars that stripped the roads of their fat traffic , even while he blessed them , for the free hand they allowed him with his neighbors . He had not hoped much from the solitary rider he had glimpsed from his tower , but all was grist that came to his mill . With a practised eye he took in Conan 's worn mail and dark , scarred face , and his conclusions were the same as those of the riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty purse and a ready blade . " Who are you , knave ? " he demanded . " A mercenary , riding for Argos , " answered Conan . " What matternames ? " " You are riding in the wrong direction for a Free Companion , " grunted Valbroso . " Southward the fighting is good and also the plundering . Join my company . You wo n't go hungry . The road remains bare of fat merchants to strip , but I mean to take my rogues and fare southward to sell our swords to whichever side seems strongest . " Conan did not at once reply , knowing that if he refused outright , he might be instantly attacked by Valbroso 's men-at-arms . Before he could make up his mind , the Zingaran spoke again : " You rogues of the Free Companies always know tricks to make me talk . I have a prisoner  --  the last merchant I caught , by Mitra , and the only one I 've seen for a week  --  and the knave is stubborn . He has an iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been unable to persuade him to open it . By Ishtar , I thought I knew all the modes of persuasion there are , but perhaps you , as a veteran Free Companion , know some that I do not . At any rate come with me and see what you may do . " Valbroso 's words instantly decided Conan . That sounded a great deal like Zorathus . Conan did not know the merchant , but any man who was stubborn enough to try to traverse the Zingaran road in times like these would very probably be stubborn enough to defy torture . He fell in beside Valbroso and rode up the straggling road to the top of the hill where the gaunt castle stood . As a man-at-arms he should have ridden behind the count , but force of habit made him careless and Valbroso paid no heed . Years of life on the borderhad taught the count that the frontier is not the royal court.  |p114He  was aware of the independence of the mercenaries , behind whose swords many a king had trodden the throne-path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris in some places . They clattered across the drawbridge and through the arch of the gate . Behind them the portcullis fell with a sullen clang . They came into a bare courtyard , grown with straggling grass , and with a well in the middle . Shacks for the men-at-arms straggled about the bailey wall , and women , slatternly or decked in gaudy finery , looked from the doors . Fighting-men in rusty mail tossed dice on the flags under the arches . It was more like a bandit 's hold than the castle of a nobleman . Valbroso dismounted and motioned Conan to follow him . They went through a doorway and along a vaulted corridor , where they were met by a scarred , hard-looking man in mail descending a stone staircase  --  evidently the captain of the guard . " How , Beloso , " quoth Valbroso ; " has he spoken ? " " He is stubborn , " muttered Beloso , shooting a glance of suspicionat Conan . Valbroso ripped out an oath and stamped furiously up the winding stair , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groans of a man in mortal agony became audible . Valbroso 's torture-room was high above the court , instead of in a dungeon below . In that chamber , where a gaunt , hairy beast of a man in leather breeks squatted gnawing a beef-bone voraciously , stood the machines of torture  --  racks , boots , hooks and all the implementsthat the human mind devises to tear flesh , break bones and rend and rupture veins and ligaments . On a rack a man was stretched naked , and a glance told Conan that he was dying . The unnatural elongation of his limbs and body told of unhinged joints and unnamable ruptures . He was a dark man , with an intelligent , aquiline face and quick dark eyes . They were glazed and bloodshot now with pain , and the dew of agony glistened on his face . His lips were drawn back from blackened gums . " There is the box . " Viciously Valbroso kicked a small but heavy iron chest that stood on the floor near by . It was intricately carved , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw no catch or hasp that might serve to unlock the lid . The marks of fire , of ax and sledge and chisel showed on it but as scratches . " This is the dog 's treasure box , " said Valbroso angrily . " Allp115men of the south know of Zorathus and his iron chest . Mitra knows what is in it . But he will not give up its secret . " Zorathus ! It was true , then ; the man he sought lay before him . Conan 's heart beat suffocatingly as he leaned over the writhing form , though he exhibited no evidence of his painful eagerness . " Ease those ropes , knave ! " he ordered the torturer harshly , and Valbroso and his captain stared . In the forgetfulness of the momentConan had used his imperial tone , and the brute in leather instinctively obeyed the knife-edge of command in that voice . He eased away gradually , for else the slackening of the ropes had been as great a torment to the torn joints as further stretching . Catching up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim to the wretch 's lips . Zorathus gulped spasmodically , the liquid slopping over on his heaving breast . Into the bloodshot eyes came a gleam of recognition , and the froth-smeared lips parted . From them issued a racking whimper in the Kothic tongue . " Is this death , then ? Is the long agony ended ? For this is King Conan who died at Valkia , and I am among the dead . " " You 're not dead , " said Conan . " But you 're dying . You 'll be tortured no more . I 'll see to that . But I ca n't help you further . Yet before you die , tell me how to open your iron box ! " " My iron box , " mumbled Zorathus in delirious disjointed phrases . " The chest forged in unholy fires among the flaming mountains of Khrosha ; the metal no chisel can cut . How many treasures has it borne , across the width and the breadth of the world ! But no such treasure as it now holds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Conan . " It can do you no good , and it may aid me . " " Aye , you are Conan , " muttered the Kothian . " I have seen you sitting on your throne in the great public hall of Tarantia , with your crown on your head and the scepter in your hand . But you are dead ; you died at Valkia . And so I know my own end is at hand . " " What does the dog say ? " demanded Valbroso impatiently , not understanding Kothic . " Will he tell us how to open the box ? " As if the voice roused a spark of life in the twisted breast Zorathus rolled his bloodshot eyes toward the speaker . " Only Valbroso will I tell , " he gasped in Zingaran . " Death is upon me . Lean close to me , Valbroso ! "  |p116The  count did so , his dark face lit with avarice ; behind him his saturnine captain , Beloso , crowded closer . " Press the seven skulls on the rim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the head of the dragon that writhes across the lid . Then press the sphere in the dragon 's claws . That will release the secret catch . " " Quick , the box ! " cried Valbroso with an oath . Conan lifted it and set it on a dais , and Valbroso shouldered him aside . " Let me open it ! " cried Beloso , starting forward . Valbroso cursed him back , his greed blazing in his black eyes . " None but me shall open it ! " he cried . Conan , whose hand had instinctively gone to his hilt , glanced at Zorathus . The man 's eyes were glazed and bloodshot , but they were fixed on Valbroso with burning intensity ; and was there the shadow of a grim twisted smile on the dying man 's lips ? Not until the merchant knew he was dying had he given up the secret . Conan turned to watch Valbroso , even as the dying man watched him . Along the rim of the lid seven skulls were carved among intertwiningbranches of strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the lid , amid ornate arabesques . Valbroso pressed the skulls in fumbling haste , and as he jammed his thumb down on the carved head of the dragon he swore sharply and snatched his hand away , shaking it in irritation . " A sharp point on the carvings , " he snarled . " I 've pricked my thumb . " He pressed the gold ball clutched in the dragon 's talons , and the lid flew abruptly open . Their eyes were da771ed by a golden flame . It seemed to their dazed minds that the carven box was full of glowing fire that spilled over the rim and dripped through the air in quivering flakes . Beloso cried out and Valbroso sucked in his breath . Conan stood speechless , his brain snared by the blaze . " Mitra , what a jewel ! " Valbroso 's hand dived into the chest , came out with a great pulsing crimson sphere that filled the room with a lambent glow . In its glare Valbroso looked like a corpse . And the dying man on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he screamed . " The jewel is yours ! I give you death with it ! The scratch on your thumb  --  look at the dragon 's head , Valbroso ! "  |p117They  all wheeled , stared . Something tiny and dully gleaming stood up from the gaping , carved mouth . " The dragon 's fang ! " shrieked Zorathus . " Steeped in the venom of the black Stygian scorpion ! Fool , fool to open the box of Zorathus with your naked hand ! Death ! You are a dead man now ! " And with bloody foam on his lips he died . Valbroso staggered , crying out . " Ah , Mitra , I bum ! " he shrieked . " My veins race with liquid fire ! My joints are bursting asunder ! Death ! Death ! " And he reeled and crashed headlong . There was an instant of awful convulsions , in which the limbs were twisted into hideous and unnatural positions , and then in that posture the man froze , his glassy eyes staring sightlessly upward , his lips drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan , stooping to pick up the jewel where it rolled on the floor from Valbroso 's rigid hand . It lay on the floor like a quivering pool of sunset fire . " Dead ! " muttered Beloso , with madness in his eyes . And then he moved . Conan was caught off guard , his eyes darned , his brain dazed by the blaze of the great gem . He did not realize Beloso 's intentionuntil something crashed with terrible force upon his helmet . The glow of the jewel was splashed with redder flame , and he went to his knees under the blow . He heard a rush of feet , a bellow of ox-like agony . He was stunned but not wholly senseless , and realized that Beloso had caught up the iron box and crashed it down on his head as he stooped . Only his basinet had saved his skull . He staggered up , drawing his sword , trying to shake the dimness out of his eyes . The room swam to his dizzy gaze . But the door was open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor the brutish torturer was gasping out his life with a great gash under his breast . And the Heart of Ahriman was gone . Conan reeled out of the chamber , sword in hand , blood streamingdown his face from under his burganet . He ran drunkenly down the steps , hearing a clang of steel in the courtyard below , shouts , then the frantic drum of hoofs . Rushing into the bailey he saw the men-at-arms milling about confusedly , while women screeched . The postern gate stood open and a soldier lay across his pike with his head split . Horses , still bridled and saddled , ran nei'hing about the court , Conan 's black stallion among them.  | " He 's mad ! " howled a woman , wringing her hands as she rushed brainlessly about . " He came out of the castle like a mad dog , hewing right and left ! Beloso 's mad ! Where 's Lord Val-broso ? " " Which way did he go ? " roared Conan . All turned and stared at the stranger 's blood-stained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shrilled a woman , pointing eastward , and another bawled : " Who is this rogue ? " " Beloso has killed Valbroso ! " yelled Conan , leaping and seizing the stallion 's mane , as the men-at-arms advanced uncertainly on him . A wild outcry burst forth at his news , but their reaction was exactly as he had anticipated . Instead of closing the gates to take him prisoner , or pursuing the fleeing slayer to avenge their lord , they were thrown into even greater confusion by his words . Wolves bound together only by fear of Valbroso , they owed no allegiance to the castle or to each other . Swords began to clash in the courtyard , and women screamed . And in the midst of it all , none noticed Conan as he shot through the postern gate and thundered down the hill . The wide plain spread before him , and beyond the hill the caravan road divided : one branch ran south , the other east . And on the eastern road he saw another rider , bending low and spurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight was a thick red haze and he reeled in his saddle , grasping the flowing mane with his hand . Blood rained on his mail , but grimly he urged the stallion on . Behind him smoke began to pour out of the castle on the hill where the count 's body lay forgotten and unheeded beside that of his prisoner . The sun was setting ; against a lurid red sky the two black figures fled . The stallion was not fresh , but neither was the horse ridden by Beloso . But the great beast responded mightily , calling on deep reservoirs of reserve vitality . Why the Zingaran fled from one pursuerConan did not tax his bruised brain to guess . Perhaps unreasoning panic rode Beloso , born of the madness that lurked in that blazing jewel . The sun was gone ; the white road was a dim dimmer through a ghostly twilight fading into purple gloom far ahead of him . The stallion panted , laboring hard . The country was changing , in the gathering dusk . Bare pains gave way to clumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . Stars began to blinkp119out . The stallion gasped and reeled in his course . But ahead rose a dense wood that stretched to the hills on the horizon , and between it and himself Conan glimpsed the dim form of the fugitive . He urged on the distressed stallion , for he saw that he was overtaking his prey , yard by yard . Above the pound of the hoofs a strange cry rose from the shadows , but neither pursuer nor pursued gave heed . As they swept in under the branches that overhung the road , they were almost side by side . A fierce cry rose from Conan 's lips as his sword went up ; a pale oval of a face was turned toward him , a sword gleamed in a half-seen hand , and Beloso echoed the cry  --  and then the weary stallion , with a lurch and a groan , missed his footing in the shadows and went heels over head , hurling his dazed rider from the saddle . Conan 's throbbing head crashed against a stone , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long Conan lay senseless he never knew . His first sensationof returning consciousness was that of being dragged by one arm over rough and stony ground , and through dense underbrush . Then he was thrown carelessly down , and perhaps the jolt brought back his senses . His helmet was gone , his head ached abominably , he felt a qualm of nausea , and blood was clotted thickly among his black locks . But with the vitality of a wild thing life and consciousness surged back into him , and he became aware of his surroundings . A broad red moon was shining through the trees , by which he knew that it was long after midnight . He had lain senseless for hours , long enough to have recovered from that terrible blow Beloso had dealt him , as well as the fall which had rendered him senseless . His brain felt clearer than it had felt during that mad ride after the fugitive . He was not lying beside the white road , he noticed with a start of surprize , as his surroundings began to record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . He lay on the grassy earth , in a small glade hemmed in by a black wall of tree stems and tangled branches . His face and hands were scratched and laceratedas if he had been dragged through brambles . Shifting his body he looked about him . And then he started violently  --  something was squatting over him . . . . At first Conan doubted his consciousness , thought it was but a figment of delirium . Surely it could not be real , that strange , mo/tionless gray being that squatted on its haunches and stared down at him with unblinking soulless eyes . Conan lay and stared , half expecting it to vanish like a figure of a dream , and then a chill of recollection crept along his spine . Half-forgotten memories surged back , of grisly tales whispered of the shapes that haunted these uninhabited forests at the foot of the hills that mark the Zingaran-Argossean border . Ghouls , man called them. , eaters of human flesh , spawn of darkness , children of unholy matings of a lost and forgotten race with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests were the ruins of an ancient , accursed city , men whispered , and among its tombs slunk gray , anthropomorphic shadows  --  Conan shudderedstrongly . He lay staring at the malformed head that rose dimly above him , and cautiously he extended a hand toward the sword at his hip . With a horrible cry that the man involuntarily echoed , the monster was at his throat . Conan threw up his right arm , and the dog-like jaws closed on it , driving the mail links into the hard flesh . The misshapen yet man-like hands clutched for his throat , but he evaded them with a heave and roll of his whole body , at the same time drawing his dagger with his left hand . They tumbled over and over on the grass , smiting and tearing . The muscles coiling under that gray corpse-like skin were stringy and hard as steel wires , exceeding the strength of a man . But Conan 's thews were iron too , and his mail saved him from the gnashing fangs and ripping claws long enough for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The horrible vitality of the semi-human monstrosity seemed inexhaustible , and the king 's skin crawled at the feel of that slick , clammy flesh . He put all his loathing and savage revulsion behind the plunging blade , and suddenly the monster heaved up convulsively beneath him as the point found its grisly heart , and then lay still . Conan rose , shaken with nausea . He stood in the center of the glade uncertainly , sword in one hand and dagger in the other . He had not lost his instinctive sense of direction , as far as the points of the compass were concerned , but he did not know in which directionthe road lay . He had no way of knowing in which directionthe ghoul had dragged him . Conan glared at the silent , black , moon-dappled woods which ringed him , and felt cold moisture bead his flesh . He was without a horse and lost in these hauntedp121woods , and that staring , deformed thing at his feet was a mute evidence of the horrors that lurked in the forest . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straining his ears for some crack of twig or rustle of grass . When a sound did come he started violently . Suddenly out on the night air broke the scream of a terrified horse . His stallion ! There were panthers in the wood  --  or  --  ghouls ate beasts as well as men . He broke savagely through the brush in the direction of the sound , whistling shrilly as he ran , his fear drowned in berserk rage . If his horse was killed , their went his last chance of followingBeloso and recovering the jewel . Again the stallion screamed with fear and fury , somewhere nearer . There was a sound of lashingheels , and something that was struck heavily and gave way . Conan burst out into the wide white road without warning , and saw the stallion plunging and rearing in the moonlight , his ears laid back , his eyes and teeth flashing wickedly . He lashed out with his heels at a slinking shadow that ducked and bobbed about him  --  and then about Conan other shadows moved : gray , furtive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charnel-house scent reeked up in the night air . With a curse the king hewed right and left with his broadsword , thrust and ripped with his dagger . Dripping fangs flashed in the moonlight , foul paws caught at him , but he hacked his way through to the stallion , caught the rein , leaped into the saddle . His sword rose and fell , a frosty are in the moon , showering blood as it split misshapen heads , clove shambling bodies . The stallion reared , biting and kicking . They burst through and thundered down the road . On either hand , for a short space , flitted gray abhorrentshadows . Then these fell behind , and Conan , topping a wooded crest , saw a vast expanse of bare slopes sweeping up and away before him.  |p122SOON  AFTER SUNRISE Conan crossed the Argossean border . Of Beloso he had seen no trace . Either the captain had made good his escape while the king lay senseless , or had fallen prey to the grim man-eaters of the Zingaran forest . But Conan had seen no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had lain unmolested for so long seemed to indicate that the monsters had been engrossed in futile pursuit of the captain . And if the man lived , Conan felt certain that he was riding along the road somewhereahead of him . Unless he had intended going into Argos he would never have taken the eastward road in the first place . The helmeted guards at the frontier did not question the Cimmerian . A single wandering mercenary required no passport nor safe-conduct , especially when his unadorned mail showed him to be in the service of no lord . Through the low , grassy hills where streams murmured and oak groves dappled the sward with lights and shadows he rode , following the long road that rose and fell away ahead of him over dales and rises in the blue distance . It was an old , old road , this highway from Poitain to the sea . Argos was at peace ; laden ox-wain rumbled along the road , and men with bare , brown , brawny arms toiled in orchards and fields that smiled away under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before inns under spreading oak branches called greetings to the wayfarer . From the men that worked the fields , from the garrulous old men in the inns where he slaked his thirst with great leathern jacks of foaming ale , from the sharp-eyed silk-clad merchants he met upon the road , Conan sought for news of Beloso . Stories were conflicting , but this much Conan learned : that a lean , wiry Zingaran with the dangerous black eyes and mustaches of the western folk was somewhere on the road ahead of him , and apparently making for Messantia . It was a logical destination ; all the sea-ports of Argos were cosmopolitan , in strong contrast with the inland provinces , and Messantia was the most polyglot of all . Craft of all the maritime nations rode in its harbor , and refugees and fugitives from many lands gathered there . Laws were lax ; for Messantia thrived on the trade of the sea , and her citizens found it profitable to be somewhat blind in their dealings with seamen . It was not only legitimate trade that flowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this Conan knew well , for had he not , in the days of old when he was a Barachan pirate , sailed by night into the harbor of Messantia to discharge strange cargoes ? Most of the pirates of the Barachan Isles  --  small islands off the southwestern coast of Zingara  --  were Argossean sailors , and as long as they confined their attentions to the shippingof other nations , the authorities of Argos were not too strict in their interpretation of sea-laws . But Conan had not limited his activities to those of the Barachans . He had also sailed with the Zingaran buccaneers , and even with those wild black corsairs that swept up from the far south to harry the northern coasts , and this put him beyond the pale of any law . If he were recognized in any of the ports of Argos it would cost him his head . But without hesitation he rode on to Messantia , halting day or night only to rest the stallion and to snatch a few winks of sleep for himselfHe entered the city unquestioned , merging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this great commercialcenter . No walls surrounded Messantia . The sea and the ships of the sea guarded the great southern trading city . It was evening when Conan rode leisurely through the streets that marched down to the waterfront . At the ends of these streets he saw the wharves and the masts and sails of ships . He smelled salt water for the first time in years , heard the thrum of cordage and the creak of spars in the breeze that was kicking up whitecaps out beyond the headlands . Again the urge of far wandering tugged at his heart . But he did not go on to the wharves . He reined aside and rode up a steep flight of wide , worn stone steps , to a broad street where ornate white mansions overlooked the waterfront and the harbor below . Here dwelt the men who had grown rich from the hardwonfat of the seas  --  a few old sea-captains who had found treasureafar , many traders and merchants who never trod the naked decks nor knew the roar of tempest of sea-fight . Conan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rode into a court where a fountain tinkled and pigeons fluttered from marble coping to marble flagging . A page in jagged silkenp124jupon and hose came forward inquiringly . The merchants of Messantiadealt with many strange and rough characters but most of these smacked of the sea . It waa strange that a mercenary trooper should so freely ride into the court of a lord of commerce . " The merchant Publio dwells here ? " It was more statement than question , and something in the timbre of the voice caused the page to doff his feathered chaperon as he bowed and replied : " Aye , so he does , my captain . " Conan dismounted and the page called a servitor , who came running to receive the stallion 's rein . " Your master is within ? " Conan drew off his gauntlets and slapped the dust of the road from cloak and mail . " Aye , my captain . Whom shall I announce ? " " I 'll announce myself , " grunted Conan . " I know the way well enough . Bide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page stood still , staring after Conan as the latter climbed a short flight of marble steps , and wondering what connection his master might have with this giant fighting-man who had the aspect of a northern barbarian . Menials at their tasks halted and gaped open-mouthed as Conan crossed a wide , cool balcony overlooking the court and entered a broad corridor through which the sea-breeze swept . Half-way down this he heard a quill scratching , and turned into a broad room whose many wide casements overlooked the harbor . Publio sat at a carved teakwood desk writing on rich parchment with a golden quill . He was a short man , with a massive head and quick dark eyes . His blue robe was of the finest watered silk , trimmed with cloth-of-gold , and from his thick white throat hung a heavy gold chain . As the Cimmerian entered , the merchant looked up with a gesture of annoyance . He froze in the midst of his gesture . His mouth opened ; he stared as at a ghost out of the past . Unbelief and fear glimmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan , " have you no word of greeting , Publio ? " Publio moistened his lips . " Conan ! he whispered incredulously . " Mitra ! Conan ! Amra ! " " Who else ? " The Cimmerian unclasped his cloak and threw it with his gauntlets down upon the desk . " How , man ? " he ex/claimed irritably . " Ca n't you at least offer me a beaker of wine ? My throat 's caked with the dust of the highway . " " Aye , wine ! " echoed . Publio mechanically . Instinctively his hand reached for a gong , then recoiled as from a hot coal , and he shuddered . While Conan watched him with a flicker of grim amusement in his eyes , the merchant rose and hurriedly shut the door , first craninghis neck up and down the corridor to be sure that no slave was loitering about . Then , returning , he took a gold vessel of wine from a near-by table and was about to fill a slender goblet when Conan impatiently took the vessel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with gusto . " Aye , it 's Conan , right enough , " muttered Publio . " Man , are you mad ? " " By Crom , Publio , " said Conan , lowering the vessel but retainingit in his hands , " you dwell in different quarters than of old . It takes an Argossean merchant to wring wealth out of a little waterfrontshop that stank of rotten fish and cheap wine . " " The old days are past , " muttered Publio , drawing his robe about him with a slight involuntary shudder . " I have put off the past like a worn-out cloak . " " Well , " retorted Conan , " you ca n't put me off like an old cloak . It is n't much I want of you , but that much I do want . And you ca n't refuse me . We had too many dealings in the old days . Am I such a fool that I 'm not aware that this fine mansion was built on my sweat and blood ? How many cargoes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants of Messantia have dealt with the sea-rovers at one time or another , " mumbled Publio nervously . " But not with the black corsairs , " answered Conan grimly . " For Mitra 's sake , be silent ! " ejaculated Publio , sweat starting out on his brow . His fingers jerked at the gilt worked edge of his robe . " Well , I only wished to recall it to your mind , " answered Conan . " Do n't be so fearful . You took plenty of risks in the past , when you were struggling for life and wealth in that lousy little shop down by the wharves , and were hand-and-glove with every buccaneer and smuggler and pirate from here to the Barachan Isles . Prosperity must have softened you . " " I am respectable , " began Publio.  | " Meaning you 're rich as hell , " snorted Conan . " Why ? Why did you grow wealthy so much quicker than your competitors ? Was it because you did a big business in ivory and ostrich feathers , copperand skins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the coast of Kush ? And where did you get them so cheaply , while other merchants were paying their weight in silverto the Stygians for them ? I 'll tell you , in case you 've forgotten : you bought them from me , at considerably less than their value , and I took them from the tribes of the Black Coast , and from the ships of the Stygians  --  I , and the black corsairs . " " In Mitra 's name , cease ! " begged Publio . " I have not forgotten . But what are you doing here ? I am the only man in Argos who knew that the king of Aquilonia was once Conan the buccaneer , in the old days . But word has come southward of the overthrow of Aquilonia and the death of the king . " " My enemies have killed me a hundred times by rumors , " grunted Conan . " Yet here I sit and guzzle wine of Kyros . " And he suited the action to the word . Lowering the vessel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's but a small thing I ask of you , Publio . I know that you 're aware of everything that goes on in Messantia . I want to know if a Zingarannamed Beloso , or he might call himself anything , is in this city . He 's tall and lean and dark like all his race , and it 's likely he 'll seek to sell a very rare jewel . " Publio shook his head . " I have not heard of such a man . But thousands come and go in Messantia . If he is here my agents will discover him . " " Good . Send them to look for him . And in the meantime have my horse cared for , and have food served me here in this room . " Publio assented volubly , and Conan emptied the wine vessel , tossed it carelessly into a corner , and strode to a near-by casement , involuntarily expanding his chest as he breathed deep of the salt air . He was looking down upon the meandering waterfront streets . He swept the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and stared beyond the bay , far into the blue haze of the distance where sea met sky . And his memory sped beyond that horizon , to the golden seas of the south , under flaming suns , where laws were not and life ran hotly . Some vagrantscent of spice or palm woke clear-etched images of strange coasts where mangroves grew and drums thundered , of shipsp127locked in battle and decks running blood , of smoke and flame and the crying of slaughter .... Lost in his thoughts he scarcely noticedwhen Publio stole from the chamber . Gathering up his robe , the merchant hurried along the corridors until he came to a certain chamber where a tall , gaunt man with a scar upon his temple wrote continually upon parchment . There was something about this man which made his clerkly occupation seem incongruous . To him Publio spoke abruptly : " Conan has returned ! " " Conan ? " The gaunt man started up and the quill fell from his fingers . " The corsair ? " " Aye ! " The gaunt man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discovered here we are ruined ! They will hang a man who shelters or trades with a corsair as quickly as they 'll hang the corsair himself ! What if the governor should learn of our past connections with him ? " " He will not learn , " answered Publio grimly . " Send your men into the markets and wharfside dives and learn if one Beloso , a Zingaran , is in Messantia . Conan said he had a gem , which he will probably seek to dispose of . The jewel merchants should know ofhim , if any do . And here is another task for you : pick up a dozen or so desperate villains who can be trusted to do away with a man and hold their tongues afterward . You understand me ? " " I understand . " The other nodded slowly and somberly . " I have not stolen , cheated , lied and fought my way up from the gutter to be undone now by a ghost out of my past , " muttered Publio , and the sinister darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ladies , who bought their silks and pearls from his many stalls . But when he returned to Conan a short time later , bearing in his own hands a platter of fruit and meats , he presented a placid face to his unwelcomeguest . Conan still stood at the casement , staring down into the harbor at the purple and crimson and vermilion and scarlet sails of galleons and carracks and galleys and dromonds . " There 's a Stygian galley , if I 'm not blind , " he remarked , pointing to a long , low , slim black ship lying apart from the others , anchored off the low broad sandy beach that curved round to the distant headland . " Is there peace , then , between Stygia and Argos ? "  | " The same sort that has existed before , " answered Publio , settingthe platter on the table with a sigh of relief , for it was heavily laden ; he knew his guest of old . " Stygian ports are temporarily open to our ships , as ours to theirs . But may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of land ! That galley crept into the bay last night . What its masters wish I do not know . So far they have neither bought nor sold . I distrust those darkskinneddevils . Treachery had its birth in that dusky land . " " I 've made them howl , " said Conan carelessly , turning from the window . " In my galley manned by black corsairs I crept to the very bastions of the sea-washed castles of black-walled Khemi by night , and burned the galleons anchored there . And speaking of treachery , mine host , suppose you taste these viands and sip a bit of this wine , just to show me that your heart is on the right side . " Publio complied so readily that Conan 's suspicions were lulled , and without further hesitation he sat down and devoured enough for three men . And while he ate , men moved through the markets and along the waterfront , searching for a Zingaran who had a jewel to sell or who sought for a ship to carry him to foreign ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temple sat with his elbows on a wine-stained table in a squalid cellar with a brass lantern hanging from a smoke-blackened beam overhead , and held converse with the desperate rogues whose sinister countenances and ragged garmentsproclaimed their profession . And as the first stars blinked out , they shone on a strange band spurring their mounts along the white road that led to Messantia from the west . They were four men , tall , gaunt , clad in black , hooded robes , and they did not speak . They forced their steeds mercilessly onward , and those steeds were gaunt as themselves , and sweat-stained and weary as if from long travel and far wandering.  |p129CoNAN  WOKE FRom a sound sleep as quickly and instantly as a cat . And like a cat he was on his feet with his sword out before the man who had touched him could so much as draw back . " What word , Publio ? " demanded Conan , recognizing his host . The gold lamp burned low , casting a mellow glow over the thick tapestries and the rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Publio , recovering from the start given him by the sudden actionof his awakening guest , replied : " The Zingaran has been located . He arrived yesterday , at dawn . Only a few hours ago he sought to sell a huge , strange jewel to a Shemitish merchant , but the Shemite would have naught to do with it . Men say he turned pale beneath his black beard at the sight of it , and closing his stall , fled as from a thing accursed . " " It must be Beloso , " muttered Conan , feeling the pulse in his temples pounding with impatient eagerness . " Where is he now ? " " He sleeps in the house of Servio . " " I know that dive of old , " grunted Conan . " I 'd better hasten beforesome of these waterfront thieves cut his throat for the jewel . " He took up his cloak and flung it over his shoulders , then donned a helmet Publio had procured for him . " Have my steed saddled and ready in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste . I shall not forget this night 's work , Publio . " A few moments later Publio , standing at a small outer door , watched the king 's tall figure receding down the shadowy street . " Farewell to you , corsair , " muttered the merchant . " This must be a notable jewel , to be sought by a man who has just lost a kingdom . I wish I had told my knaves to let him secure it before they did their work . But then , something might have gone awry . Let Argos forget Amra , and let my dealings with him be lost in the dust of the past . In the alley behind the house of Servio  --  that is where Conan will cease to be a peril to me . " Servio 's house , a dingy , ill-famed den , was located close to the wharves , facing the waterfront . It was a shambling building of stone and heavy ship-beams , and a long narrow alley wandered up alongside it . Conan made his way along the alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy feeling that he was beingp130spied upon . He stared hard into the shadows of the squalid buildings , but saw nothing , though once he caught the faint rasp of cloth or leather against flesh . But that was nothing unusual . Thieves and beggars prowled these alleys all night , and they were not likely to attack him , after one look at his size and harness . But suddenly a door opened in the wall ahead of him , and he slipped into the shadow of an arch . A figure emerged from the open door and moved along , the alley , not furtively , but with a natural noiselessness , like that of a jungle beast . Enough starlight filtered into the alley to silhouette the man 's profile dimly as he passed the doorway where Conan lurked . The stranger was a Stygian . There was no mistaking that hawk-faced , shaven head , even in the starlight , nor the mantle over the broad shoulders . He passed on down the alley in the direction of the beach , and once Conan thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he caught a flash of lambent light , just as the man vanished . But the Cimmerian forgot the stranger as he noticed that the door through which he had emerged still stood open . Conan had intended entering by the main entrance and forcing Servio to show him the room where the Zingaran slept . But if he could get into the house without attracting anyone 's attention , so much the better . A few long strides brought him to the door , and as his hands fell on the lock he stifled an involuntary grunt . His practised fingers , skilled among the thieves of Zamora long ago , told him that the lock had been forced , apparently by some terrific pressurefrom the outside that had twisted and bent the heavy iron bolts , tearing the very sockets loose from the jambs . How such damage could have been wrought so violently without awakening everyone in the neighborhood Conan could not imagine , but he felt sure that it had been done that night . A broken lock , if discovered , would not go unmended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cutthroats . Conan entered stealthily , poniard in hand , wondering how he was to find the chamber of the Zingaran . Groping in total darknesshe halted suddenly . He sensed death in that room , as a wild beast senses it  --  not as peril threatening him , but a dead thing , something freshly slain . In the darkness his foot hit and recoiled from something heavy and yielding . With a sudden premonition he groped along the wall until he found the shelf that supportedp131the brass lamp , with its flint , steel and tinder beside it . A few secondslater a flickering , uncertain light sprang up , and he stared narrowly about him . A bunk built against the rough stone wall , a bare table and a bench completed the furnishings of the squalid chamber . An inner door stood closed and bolted . And on the hard-beaten dirt floor lay Beloso . On his back he lay , with his head drawn back between his shoulders so that he seemed to stare with his wide glassy eyes at the sooty beams of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth in a frozen grin of agony . His sword lay near him , still in its scabbard . His shirt was torn open , and on his brown , muscular breast was the print of a black hand , thumb and four fingers plainly distinct . Conan glared in silence , feeling the short hairs bristle at the back of his neck . " Crom ! " he muttered . " The black hand of Set ! " He had seen that mark of old , the death-mark of the black priests of Set , the grim cult that ruled in dark Stygia . And suddenly he remembered that curious flash he had seen emanating from the mysterious Stygian who had emerged from this chamber . " The Heart , by Crom ! " he muttered . " He was carrying it under his mantle . He stole it . He burst that door by his magic , and slew Beloso . He was a priest of Set . " A quick investigation confirmed at least part of his suspicions . The jewel was not on the ZingaraWs body . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance , or without design ; a conviction that the mysterious Stygian galley had come into the harbor of Messantia on a definite mission . How could the priests of Set know that the Heart had come southward ? Yet the thought was no more fantastic than the necromancy that could slay an armed man by the touch of an open , empty hand . A stealthy footfall outside the door brought him round like a great cat . With one motion he extinguished the lamp and drew his sword . His ears told him that men were out there in the darkness , were closing in on the doorway . As his eyes became accustomed to the sudden darkness , he could make out dim figures ringing the entrance . He could not guess their identity , but as always he took the initiative  --  leaping suddenly forth from the doorway without awaiting the attack . His unexpected movement took the skulkers by surprise . Hep132sensed and heard men close about him , saw a dim masked figure in the starlight before him ; then his sword crunched home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slower-thinking and slower-acting attackers could intercept him . As he ran he heard , somewhere ahead of him , a faint creak of oar-locks , and he forgot the men behind him . A boat was moving out into the bay ! Gritting his teeth he increased his speed , but before he reached the beach he heard the rasp and creak of ropes , and the grind of the great sweep in its socket . Thick clouds , rolling up from the sea , obscured the stars . In thick darkness Conan came upon the strand , straining his eyes out across the black restless water . Something was moving out there  --  a long , low , black shape that receded in the darkness , gathering momentum as it went . To his ears came the rhythmical clack of long oars . He ground his her the jewel that meant to him the throne of Aquilonia . With a savage curse he took a step toward the waves that lapped against the sands , catching at his hauberk and intending to rip it off and swim after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand brought him about . He had forgotten his pursuers . Dark figures closed in on him with a rush of feet through the sands . The first went down beneath the Cimmerian 's flailing sword , but the others did not falter . Blades whickered dimly about him in the darkness or rasped on his mail . Blood and entrailsspilled over his hand and someone screamed as he ripped murderously upward . A muttered voice spurred on the attack , and that voice sounded vaguely familiar . Conan plowed through the clinging , hacking shapes toward the voice . A faint light gleaming momentarily through the drifting clouds showed him a tall gaunt man with a great livid scar on his temple . Conan 's sword sheared through his skull as through a ripe melon . Then an ax , swung blindly in the dark , crashed on the king 's basinet , filling his eyes with sparks of fire . He lurched and lunged , felt his sword sink deep and heard a shriek of agony . Then he stumbled over a corpse , and a bludgeon knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club fell full on his unprotectedskull . The king of Aquilonia crumpled into the wet sands . Over him wolfish figures panted in the gloom.  | " Strike off his head , " muttered one . " Let him lie , " grunted another . " Help me tie up my wounds before I bleed to death . The tide will wash him into the bay . See , he fell at the water 's edge . His skull 's split ; no man could live after such blows . " " Help me strip him , " urged another . " His harness will fetch a few pieces of silver . And haste . Tiberio is dead , and I hear seamen singing as they reel along the strand . Let us be gone . " There followed hurried activity in the darkness , and then the sound of quickly receding footsteps . The tipsy singing of the seamen grew louder . In his chamber Publio , nervously pacing back and forth before a window that overlooked the shadowed bay , whirled suddenly , his nerves tingling . To the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but now it stood open and four men filed into the chamber . At the sight of them his flesh crawled . Many strange beings Publio had seen in his lifetime , but none before like these . They were tall and gaunt , black-robed , and their faces were dim yellow ovals in the shadows of their coifs . He could not tell much about their features and was unreasoningly glad that he could not . Each bore a long , curiously mottled staff . " Who are you ? " he demanded , and his voice sounded brittle and hollow . " What do you wish here ? " " Where is Conan , he who was king of Aquilonia ? " demanded the tallest of the four in a passionless monotone that made Publio shudder . It was like the hollow tone of a Khitan temple bell . " I do not know what you mean , " stammered the merchant , his customary poise shaken by the uncanny aspect of his visitors . " I know no such man . " " He has been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His horse is in the courtyard . Tell us where he is beforewe do you an injury . " " Geball " shouted Publio frantically , recoiling until he crouched against the wall . " Geball " The four Khitans watched him without emotion or change of expression . " If you summon your slave he will die , " warned one of them , which only served to terrify Publio more than ever . " Gebal ! " he screamed . " Where are you , curse you ? Thieves are murdering your master ! "  |p134Swift  footsteps in the corridor outside , and Gebal burst into the chamber  --  a Shemite , of medium height and mightily muscled build , his curled blue-black beard bristling , and a short leafshapedsword in his hand . He stared in stupid amazement at the four invaders , unable to understand their presence ; dimly remembering that he had drowsed unexplainably on the stair he was guarding and up which they must have come . He had never slept on duty before . But his master was shrieking with a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bull at the strangers , his thickly muscled arm drawing back for the disemboweling thrust . But the stroke was never dealt . A black-sleeved arm shot out , extending the long staff . Its end but touched the Shemite 's brawny breast and was instantly withdrawn . The stroke was horribly like the dart and recovery of a serpent 's head . Gebal halted short in his headlong plunge , as if he had encountereda solid barrier . His bull head toppled forward on his breast , the sword slipped from his fingers , and then he melted slowly to the floor . It was as if all the bon : ; of his frame had suddenly becomeflabby . Publio turned sick . " Do not shout again , " advised the tallest Khitan . " Your servantssleep soundly , but if you awaken them they will die , and you with them . Where is Conan ? " " He is gone to the house of Servio , near the waterfront , to search for the Zingaran Beloso , " gasped Publio , all his power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack courage ; but these uncanny visitants turned his marrow to water . He started convulsively at a sudden noise of footsteps hurrying up the stair outside , loud in the ominous stillness . " Your servant ? " asked the Khitan . Publio shook his head mutely , his tongue frozen to his palate . He could not speak . One of the Khitans caught up a silken cover from a couch and threw it over the corpse . Then they melted behind the tapestry , but before the tallest man disappeared , he murmured : " Talk to this man who comes , and send him away quickly . If you betray us , neither he nor you will live to reach that door . Make no sign to show him that you are not alone . " And lifting his staff suggestively , the yellow man faded behind the hangings.  |p135Publio  shuddered and choked down a desire to retch . It might have been a trick of the light , but it seemed to him that occasionallythose staffs moved slightly of their own accord , as if possessedof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with a mighty effort , and presented a composed aspect to the ragged ruffian who burst into the chamber . " We have done as you wished , my lord , " this man exclaimed . " The barbarian lies dead on the sands at the water 's edge . " Publio felt a movement in the arras behind him , and almost burst from fright . The man swept heedlessly on . " Your secretary , Tiberio , is dead . The barbarian slew him , and four of my companions . We bore their bodies to the rendezvous . There was nothing of value on the barbarian except a few silver coins . Are there any further orders ? " " None ! " gasped Publio , white about the lips . " Go ! " The desperado bowed and hurried out , with a vague feeling that Publio was both a man of weak stomach and few words . The four Khitans came from behind the arras . T " Of whom did this man speak ? " the taller demanded . " Of a wandering stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You lie , " said the Khitan calmly . " He spoke of the king of Aquilonia . I read it in your expression . Sit upon that divan and do not move or speak . I will remain with you while my three companionsgo search for the body . " So Publio sat and shook with terror of the silent , inscrutable figure which watched him , until the three Khitans filed back into the room , with the news that Conan 's body did not lie upon the sands . Publio did not know whether to be glad or sorry . " We found the spot where the fight was fought , " they said . " Blood was on the sand . But the king was gone . " The fourth Khitan drew imaginary symbols upon the carpet with his staff , which glistened scalily in the lamplight . " Did you read naught from the sands ? " he asked . " Aye , " they answered . " The king lives , and he has gone southwardin a ship . " The tall Khitan lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant broke into a profuse sweat . " What do you wish of me ? " he stuttered.  | " A ship , " answered the Khitan . " A ship well manned for a very long voyage- " " For how long a voyage ? " stammered Publio , never thinking of refusing . " To the ends of the world , perhaps , " answered the Khitan , " or to the molten seas of hell that lie beyond the sunrise . "  |p137CONAN  'S FIRST SENSATION of returning consciousness was that ofmotion ; under him was no solidity , but a ceaseless heaving and plunging . Then he heard wind humming through cords and spars , and knew he was aboard a ship even before his blurred sight cleared . He heard a mutter of voices and then a dash of water deluged him , jerking him sharply into full animation . He heaved up with a sulfurous curse , braced his legs and glared about him , with a burst of coarse guffaws in his ears and the reek of unwashed bodies in his nostrils . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running before the wind that whipped down from the north , her striped sail bellying against the taut sheets . The sun was just rising , in a daZ71ing blaze of gold and blue and green . To the left of the shoreline was a dim purple shadow . To the right stretched the open ocean . This much Conan saw at a glance that likewise includedthe ship itself . It was long and narrow , a typical trading-ship of the southern coasts , high of poop and stern , with cabins at either extremity . Conan looked down into the open waist , whence wafted that sickening abominable odor . He knew it of old . It was the bodyscentof the oarsmen , chained to their benches . They were all negroes , forty men to each side , each confined by a chain locked about his waist , with the other end welded to a heavy ring set deep in the solid runway beam that ran between the benches from stem to stern . The life of a slave aboard an Argossean galley was a hell unfathomable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blacks who now rested on their idle oars and stared up at the stranger with dull curiosity were from the far southern isles , the homelands of the corsairs . Conan recognized them by their straighter features and hair , their rangier , cleaner-limbed build . And he saw among them men who had followed him of old . But all this he saw and recognized in one swift , all-embracing glance as he rose , before he turned his attention to the figures about him . Reeling momentarily on braced legs , his fists clenched wrathfully , he glared at the figures clustered about him . The sailor who had drenched him stood grinning , the empty bucket still poised in his hand , and Conan cursed him with venom , instinc/tively reaching for his hilt . Then he discovered that he was weaponlessand naked except for his short leather breeks . " What lousy tub is this ? " he roared . " How did I come aboard here ? " The sailors laughed jeeringly  --  stocky , bearded Argosseans to a man  --  and one , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and said domineeringly : " We found you lying on the sands . Somebody had rapped you on the pate and taken your clothes . Needing an extra man , we brought you aboard . " " What ship is this ? " Conan demanded . " The Venturer , out of Messantia , with a cargo of mirrors , scarletsilk cloaks , shields , gilded helmets and swords to trade to the Shemites for copper and gold ore . I am Demetrio , captain of this vessel and your master henceforward . " " Then I 'm headed in the direction I wanted to go , after all , " muttered Conan , heedless of that last remark . They were racing southeastward , following the long curve of the Argossean coast . These trading-ships never ventured far from the shoreline . Somewhereahead of him he knew that low dark Stygian galley was speeding southward . " Have you sighted a Stygian galley  --  " began Conan , but the beard of the burly , brutal-faced captain bristled . He was not in the least interested in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it high time he reduced this independent wastrel to his proper place . " Get for'ard ! " he roared . " I 've wasted time enough with you ! I 've done you the honor of having you brought to the poop to be revived , and answered enough of your infernal questions . Get off this poop ! You 'll work your way aboard this galley  --  " " I 'll buy your ship  --  " began Conan , before he remembered that he was a penniless wanderer . A roar of rough mirth greeted these words , and the captain turned purple , thinking he sensed ridicule . " You mutinous swine ! " he bellowed , taking a threatening step forward , while he closed on his knife at his belt . " Get for'ard before I have you flogged ! You 'll keep a civil tongue in your jaws , or by Mitra , I 'll have you chained among the blacks to tug an oar ! " Conan 's volcanic temper , never long at best , burst into explosion . Not in years , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him thus and lived.  | " Do n't lift your voice to me , you tar-breeched dog ! " he roared in a voice as gusty as the sea-wind , while the sailors gaped dumfounded . " Draw that toy and I 'll feed you to the fishes ! " " Who do you think you are ? " gasped the captain . " I 'll show you ! " roared the maddened Cimmerian , and he wheeled and bounded toward the rail , where weapons hung in their brackets . The captain drew his knife and ran at him bellowing , but before he could strike , Conan gripped his wrist with a wrench that tore the arm clean out of the socket . The captain bellowed like an ox in agony , and then rolled clear across the deck as he was hurled contemptuously from his attacker . Conan ripped a heavy ax from the rail and wheeled cat-like to meet the rush of the sailors . They ran in , giving tongue like hounds , clumsy-footed and awkward in comparison to the pantherish Cimmerian . Before they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking right and left too quickly for the eye to follow , and blood and brains spatteredas two corpses struck the deck . Knives flailed the air wildly as Conan broke through the stumbling , gasping mob and bounded to the narrow bridge that spanned the waist from poop to forecastle , just out of reach of the slaves below . Behind him the handful of sailors on the poop were floundering after him , daunted by the destruction of their fellows , and the rest of the crew  --  some thirty in all  --  came running across the bridge toward him , with weapons in their hands . Conan bounded out on the bridge and stood poised above the upturned black faces , ax lifted , black mane blown in the wind . " Who am IT ' he yelled . " Look , you dogs ! Look , Ajonga , Yasunga , Laranga ! Who am I ? " And from the waist rose a shout that swelled to a mighty roar : " Amra ! It is Amra ! The Lion has returned ! " The sailors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrank back , staring in sudden fear at the wild figure on the bridge . Was this in truth that bloodthirsty ogre of the southern seas who had so mysteriously vanished years ago , but who still lived in gory legends ? The blacks were frothing crazy now , shaking and tearing at their chains and shrieking the name of Amra like an invocation . Kushites who had never seen Conan before took up the yell . The slaves in the pen under the after-cabin began to batter at the walls , shrieking like the damned . Demetrio , hitching himself along the deck on one hand and hisp140knees , livid with the agony of his dislocated arm , screamed : " In and kill him , dogs , before the slaves break loose ! " Fired to desperation by that word , the most dread to all galleymen , the sailors charged on to the bridge from both ends . But with a lion-like bound Conan left the bridge and hit like a cat on his feet on the runway between the benches . " Death to the masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell crashingly full on a shackle-chain , severing it like matchwood . In an instant a shrieking slave was free , splintering his oar for a bludgeon . Men were racing frantically along the bridge above , and all hell and bedlam broke loose on the Venturer . Conan 's ax rose and fell without pause , and with every stroke a frothing , screamingblack giant broke free , mad with hate and the fury of freedom and vengeance . Sailors leaping down into the waist to grapple or smite at the naked white giant hewing like one possessed at the shackles , found themselves dragged down by hands of slaves yet unfreed , while others , their broken chains whipping and snapping about their limbs , came up out of the waist like a blind , black torrent , screaming like fiends , smiting with broken oars and pieces of iron , tearing and rending with talons and teeth . In the midst of the melee the slaves in the pen broke down the walls and came surgingup on the decks , and with fifty blacks freed of their benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add his notched ax to the bludgeons of his partizans . Then it was massacre . The Argosseans were strong , sturdy , fearless like all their race , trained in the brutal school of the sea . But they could not stand against these maddened giants , led by the tigerish barbarian . Blows and abuse and hellish suffering were avenged in one red gust of fury that raged like a typhoon from one end of the ship to the other , and when it had blown itself out , but one white man lived aboard the Venturer , and that was the blood-stained giant about whom the chanting blacks thronged to cast themselves prostrate on the bloody deck and beat their heads against the boards in an ecstasy of hero-worship . Conan , his mighty chest heaving and glistening with sweat , the red ax gripped in his blood-smeared hand , glared about him as the first of men might have glared in some primordial dawn , and shook back his black mane . In that moment he was not king of Aquilonia ; he was again lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lordship through flame and blood.  | " Amra ! Aram ! " chanted the delirious blacks , those who were left to chant . " The Lion has returned ! Now will the Stygians howl like dogs in the night , and the black dogs of Kush will howl ! Now will villages burst in flames and ships founder ! Ale , there will be wailing of women and the thunder of the spears ! " " Cease this yammering , dogs ! " Conan roared in a voice that drowned the clap of the sail in the wind . " Ten of you go below and free the oarsmen who are yet chained . The rest of you man the sweeps and bend to oars and halyards . Crom 's devils , do n't you see we 've drifted inshore during the fight ? Do you want to run aground and be retaken by the Argosseans ? Throw these carcasses overboard . Jump to it , you rogues , or I 'll notch your hides for you ! " With shouts and laughter and wild singing they leaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were hurled overboard , where triangular fins were already cutting the water . Conan stood on the poop , frowning down at the black men who watched him expectantly . His heavy brown arms were folded , his black hair , grown long in his wanderings , blew in the wind . A wilder and more barbaric figure never trod the bridge of a ship , and in this ferocious corsair few of the courtiers of Aquilonia would have recognized their king . " There 's food in the hold ! " he roared . " Weapons in plenty for you , for this ship carried blades and harness to the Shemites who dwell along the coast . There are enough of us to. , work ship , aye , and to fight ! You rowed in chains for the Argossean dogs : will you row as free men for Amra ? " " Aye ! " they roared . " We are thy children ! Lead us where you will ! " " Then fall to and clean out that waist , " he commanded . " Free men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with me and break out food from the after-cabin . By Crom , I 'll pad out your ribs before this cruise is done ! " Another yell of approbation answered him , as the half-starved blacks scurried to do his bidding . The sail bellied as the wind swept over the waves with renewed force , and the white crests danced along the sweep of the wind . Conan planted his feet to the heave of the deck , breathed deep and spread his mighty arms . King of Aquilonia he might no longer be ; king of the blue ocean he was still.  |p142THE  Venturer SWEPT southward like a living thing , her oars pulled now by free and willing lands . She had been transformed from a peaceful trader into a war-galley , insofar as the transformationwas possible . Men sat at the benches now with swords at their sides and gilded helmets on their kinky heads . Shields were hung along the rails , and sheafs of spears , bows and arrows adorned the mast . Even the elements seemed to work for Conan now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held day by day , needing little aid from the oars . But though Conan kept a man on the masthead day and night , they did not sight a long , low , black galley fleeing southward ahead of them . Day by day the blue waters rolled empty to their view , broken only by fishing-craft which fled like frightened birds before them , at sight of the shields hung along the rail . The season for trading was practically over for the year , and they sighted no other ships . When the lookout did sight a sail , it was to the north , not the south . Far on the skyline behind them appeared a racing-galley , with full spread of purple sail . The blacks urged Conan to turn and plunder it , but he shook his head . Somewhere south of him a slim black galley was racing toward the ports of Stygia . That night , before darkness shut down , the lookout 's last glimpse showed him the racing-galley on the horizon , and at dawn it was still hanging on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conan wondered if it was following him , though he could think of no logicalreason for such a supposition . But he paid little heed . Each day that carried him farther southward filled him with fiercer impatience . Doubts never assailed him . As he believed in the rise and set of the sun he believed that a priest of Set had stolen the Heart of Ahriman . And where would a priest of Set carry it but to Stygia ? The blacks sensed his eagerness , and toiled as they had never toiled under the lash , though ignorant of his goal . They anticipateda red career of pillage and plunder and were content . The men of the southern isles knew no other trade ; and the Kushites of the crew joined whole-heartedly in the prospect of looting their own people , with the callousness of their race . Bloodtiesmeant little ; a victorious chieftain and personal gain everything.  |p143Soon  the character of the coastline changed . No longer they sailed past steep cliffs with blue hills marching behind them . Now the shore was the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swept away and away into the hazy distance . Here were few harbors and fewer ports , but the greenL plain was dotted with the cities of the Shemites ; green sea , lapping the rim of the green plains , and the zikkurats of the cities gleamingwhitely in the sun , some small in the distance . Through the grazing-lands moved the herds of cattle , and squat , broad riders with cylindrical helmets and curled blue-black beards , with bows in their hands . This was the shore of the lands of Shem , where there was no law save as each city-state could enforceits own . Far to the eastward , Conan knew , the meadowlands gave way to desert , where there were no cities and the nomadic tribes roamed unhindered . Still as they plied southward , past the changeless panorama of city-dotted meadowland , at last the scenery again began to alter . Clumps of tamarind appeared , the palm groves grew denser . The shoreline became more broken , a marching rampart of green fronds and trees , and behind them rose bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along their moist banks vegetation grew thick and of vast variety . So at last they passed the mouth of a broad river that mingled its flow with the ocean , and saw the great black walls and towers of Khemi rise against the southern horizon . The river was the Styx , the real border of Stygia . Khemi was Stygia 's greatest port , and at the time her most important city . The king dwelt at more ancient Luxur , but in Khemi reigned the priestcraft ; though men said the center of their dark religion lay far inland , in a mysterious , deserted city near the bank of the Styx . This river , springing from some nameless source far in the unknown lands south of Stygia , ran northward for a thousand miles before it turned and flowed westward for some hundreds of miles , to empty at last into the ocean . The Venturer , showing no lights , stole past the port in the night , and before dawn discovered her , anchored in a small bay a few miles south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tangleof mangroves , palms and lianas , swarming with crocodiles and serpents . Discovery was extremely unlikely . Conan knew the place of old ; he had hidden there before , in his corsair days . As they slid silently past the city whose great black bastionsp144rose on the jutting prongs of land , which locked the harbor , torches gleamed and smoldered luridly , and to their ears came the low thunder of drums . The port was not crowded with ships , as were the harbors of Argos . The Stygians did not base their glory and power upon ships and fleets . Trading-vessels and war-galleys , indeed , they had , but not in proportion to their inland strength . Many of their craft plied up and down the great river , rather than along the sea-coasts . The Stygians were an ancient race , a dark , inscrutable people , powerful and merciless . Long ago their rule had stretched far north of the Styx , beyond the meadowlands of Shem , and into the fertile uplands now inhabited It the peoples of Koth and Ophir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Acheron . But Acheron had fallen , and the barbaric ancestors of the Hyborians had swept southward in wolfskins and horned helmets , driving the ancient rulers of the land before them . The Stygians had not forgotten . All day the Venturer lay at anchor in the tiny bay , walled in with green branches and tangled vines through which flitted gayplumed , harsh-voiced birds , and among which glided brightscaled , silent reptiles . Toward sundown a small boat crept out and down along the shore , seeking , and finding that which Conan desired  --  a Stygian fisherman in his shallow , flat-proved boat . They brought him to the deck of the Venturer  --  a tall , dark , rangily built man , ashy with fear of his captors , who were ogres of that coast . He was naked except for his silken breeks , for , like the Hyrkanians , even the commoners and slaves of Stygia wore silk ; and in his boat was a wide mantle such as these fishermen flung about their shoulders against the chill of the night . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " Stand on your legs , man , and quit trembling , " said the Cimmerianimpatiently , who found it difficult to understand abject terror . " You wo n't be harmed . Tell me but this : has a galley , a black racing-galley returning from Argos , put into Khemi within the last few days ? " " Aye , my lord , " answered the fisherman . " Only yesterday at dawn the priest Thutothmes returned from a voyage far to the north . Men say he has been to Messantia . " " What did he bring from Messantia ? " " Alas , my lord , I know not . "  | " Why did he go to Messantia ? " demanded Conan . " Nay , my lord , I am but a common man . Who am I to know the minds of the priests of Set ? I can only speak what I have seen and what I have heard men whisper along the wharves . Men say that news of great import came southward , though of what none knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off in his black galley in great haste . Now he is returned , but what he did in Argos , or what cargo he brought back , none knows , not even the seamen who manned his galley . Men say that he has opposedThoth-Amon , who is the master of all priests of Set , and dwells in Luxur , and that Thutothmes seeks hidden power to overthrowthe Great One . But who am I to say ? When priests war with one another a common man can but lie on his belly and hope neithertreads upon him . " Conan snarled in nervous exasperation at this servile philosophy , and turned to his men . " I 'm going alone into Khemi to find this thief Thutothmes . Keep this man prisoner , but see that you do him no hurt . Crom 's devils , stop your yowling ! Do you think we can sail into the harbor and take the city by storm ? I must go alone . " Silencing the clamor of protests , he doffed his own garments and donned the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's hair , but scorned the short fisherman 's knife . The common men of Stygia were not allowed to wear swords , and the mantle was not voluminous enough to hide the Cimmerian 's long blade , but Conan buckled to his hip a Ghanta knife , a weapon borne by the fierce desert men who dwelt to the south of the Stygians , a broad , heavy , slightly curved blade of fine steel , edged like a razor and long enough to dismember a man . Then , leaving the Stygian guarded by the corsairs , Conan climbed into the fisherman 's boat . " Wait for me until dawn , " he said . " If I have n't come then , I 'll never come , so hasten southward to your own homes . " As he clambered over the rail , they set up a doleful wail at his going , until he thrust his head back into sight to curse them into silence . Then , dropping into the boat , he grasped the oars and sent the tiny craft shooting over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it.  |p146THE  HARBOR OF Khemi lay between two great jutting points of land that ran into the ocean . He rounded the southern point , where the great black castles rose like a man-made hill , and entered the harbor just at dusk , when there was still enough light for the watchers to recognize the fisherman 's boat and mantle , but not enough to permit recognition of betraying details . Unchallenged he threaded his way among the great black war galleys lying silent and unlighted at anchor , and drew up to a ffight of wide stone steps which mounted up from the water 's edge . There he made his boat fast to an iron ring set in the stone , as numerous similar craft were tied . There was nothing strange in a fisherman leaving his boat there . None but a fisherman could find a use for such a craft , and they did not steal from one another . No one cast him more than a casual glance as he mounted the long steps , unobtrusively avoiding the torches that flared at intervalsabove the lapping black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returning after a fruitless day along the coast . If one had observed him closely , it might have seemed that his step was somewhat too springy and sure , his carriage somewhattoo erect and confident for a lowly fisherman . But he passed quickly , keeping in the shadows , and the commoners of Stygia were no more given to analysis than were the commoners of the less exotic races . In build he was not unlike the warrior castes of the Stygians , who were a tall , muscular race . Bronzed by the sun , he was nearly as dark as many of them . His black hair , square-cut and confined by a copper band , increased the resemblance . The characteristics which set him apart from them were the subtle difference in his walk , and his alien features and blue eyes . But the mantle was a good disguise , and he kept as much in the shadow as possible , turning away his head when a native passed him too closely . But it was a desperate game , and he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like the seaports of the Hyborians , where types of every race swarmed . The only aliens here were negro and Shemite slaves ; and he resembled neither even as much as he resembled the Stygians themselves . Strangers were not welcome in the cities of Stygia ; tolerated only when theyp147came as ambassadors or licensed traders . But even then the latter were not allowed ashore after dark . And now there were no Hyborian ships in the harbor at all . A strange restlessness ran through the city , a stirring of ancient ambitions , a whispering none could define except those who whispered . This Conan felt rather than knew , his whetted primitive instincts sensing unrest about him . If he were discovered his fate would be ghastly . They would slay him merely for being a stranger ; if he were recognized as Anita , the corsair chief who had swept their coasts with steel and flame  --  an involuntary shudder twitched Conan 's broad shoulders . Human foes he did not fear , nor any death by steel or fire . But this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Serpent , men said , banished long ago from the Hyborian races , yet lurked in the shadows of the cryptic temples , and awful and mysteriouswere the deeds done in the nighted shrines . He had drawn away from the waterfront streets with their broad steps leading down to the water , and was entering the long shadowy streets of the main part of the city . There was no such scene as was offered by any Hyborian city  --  no blaze of lamps and cressets , with gay-clad people laughing and strolling along the pavements , and shops and stalls wide open and displaying their wares . Here the stalls were closed at dusk . The only lights along the streets were torches , flaring smokily at wide intervals . People walking the streets were comparatively few ; they went hurriedly and unspeaking , and their numbers decreased with the lateness of the hour . Conan found the scene gloomy and unreal ; the silence of the people , their furtive haste , the great black stone walls that rose on each side of the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpowering and oppressive . Few lights showed anywhere except in the upper parts of the buildings . Conan knew that most of the people lay on the flat roofs , among the palms of artificial gardens under the stars . There was a murmur of weird music from somewhere . Occasionally a bronze chariot rumbled along the flags , and there was a brief glimpse of a tall , hawk-faced noble , with a silk cloak wrapped about him , and a gold band with a rearing serpent-head emblem confining his black mane ; of the ebon , naked charioteer bracing his knotty legs against the straining of the fierce Stygian horses.  |p148But  the people who yet traversed the streets on foot were commoners , slaves , tradesmen , harlots , toilers , and they became fewer as he progressed . He was making toward the temple of Set , where he knew he would be likely to find the priest he sought . He believed he would know Thutothmes if he saw him , though his one glance had been in the semi-darkness of the Messantian alley . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certain . Only occultists high in the mazes of the hideous Black Ring possessed the power of the black hand that dealt death by its touch ; and only such a man would dare defy Thoth-Amon , whom the western world knew only as a figure of terror and myth . The street broadened , and Conan was aware that he was getting into the part of the city dedicated to the temples . The great structures reared their black bulks against the dim stars , grim , indescribablymenacing in the flare of the few torches . And suddenly he heard a low scream from a woman on the other side of the street and somewhat ahead of him  --  a naked courtezan wearingthe tall plumed head-dress of her class . She was shrinking back against the wall , staring across at something he could not yet see . At her cry the few people on the street halted suddenly as if frozen . At the same instant Conan was aware of a sinister slithering ahead of him . Then about the dark corner of the buildinghe was approaching poked a hideous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coil of rippling , darkly glistening trunk . The Cimmerian recoiled , remembering tales he had heard  --  serpentswere sacred to Set , god of Stygia , who men said was himself a serpent . Monsters such as this were kept in the temples of Set , and when they hungered , were allowed to crawl forth into the streets to take what prey they wished . Their ghastly feasts were considered a sacrifice to the scaly god . The Stygians within Conan 's sight fell to their knees , men and women , and passively awaited their fate . One the great serpent would select , would lap in scaly coils , crush to a red pulp and swallow as a rat-snake swallows a mouse . The others would live . That was the will of the gods . But it was not Conan 's will . The python glided toward him , its attention probably attracted by the fact that he was the only human in sight still standing erect . Gripping his great knife under his mantle , Conan hoped the slimy brute would pass him by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering torchlight , its forked tongue flickering in and out , its cold eyes glittering with the ancient cruelty of the serpent-folk . Its neck arched , but before it could dart , Conan whipped his knife from under his mantle and struck like a flicker of lightning . The broad blade split that wedge-shaped head and sheared deep into the thick neck . Conan wrenched his knife free and sprang clear as the great body knotted and looped and Whipped terrifically in its death throes . In the moment that he stood staring in morbid fascination , the only sound was the thud and swish of the snake 's tail against the stones . Then from the shocked votaries burst a terrible cry : " Blasphemer ! He has slain the sacred son of Set ! Slay him ! Slay ! Slay ! " Stones whizzed about him and the crazed Stygians rushed at him , shrieking hysterically , while from all sides others emerged from their houses and took up the cry . With a curse Conan wheeled and darted into the black mouth of an alley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he ran more by feel than by sight , and the walls resounded to the vengeful yells of the pursuers . Then his left hand found a break in the wall , and he turned sharply into another , narrower alley . On both sides rose sheer black stone walls . High above him he could see a thin line of stars . These giant walls , he knew , were the walls of temples . He heard , behind him , the pack sweep past the dark mouth in full cry . Their shouts grew distant , faded away . They had missed the smaller alley and run straight on in the blackness . He too kept straight ahead , though the thought of encountering another of Set 's " sons " in the darkness brought a shudder from him . Then somewhere ahead of him he caught a moving glow , like that of a crawling glow-worm . He halted , flattened himself against the wall and gripped his knife . He knew what it was : a man approaching with a torch . Now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped it , and the dim oval of a dark face . A few more steps and the man would certainly see him . He sank into a tigerish crouch  --  the torch halted . A door was briefly etched in the glow , while the torch-bearer fumbled with it . Then it opened , the tall figure vanished through it , and darkness closed again on the alley . There was a sinister suggestion of furtiveness aboutp150that slinking figure , entering the alley-door in darkness ; a priest , perhaps returning from some dark errand . But Conan groped toward the door . If one man came up that alley with a torch , others might come at any time . To retreat the way he had come might mean to run full into the mob from which he was fleeing . At any moment they might return , find the narroweralley and come howling down it . He felt hemmed in by those sheer , unscalable walls , desirous of escape , even if escape meant invading some unknown building . The heavy bronze door was not locked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack . He was looking into a great square chamber of massive black stone . A torch smoldered in a niche in the wall . The chamber was empty . He glided through the lacquered door and closed it behind him . His sandaled feet made no sound as he crossed the black marblefloor . A teak door stood partly open , and gliding through this , knife in hand , he came out into a great , dim , shadowy place whose lofty ceiling was only a hint of darkness high above him , toward which the black walls swept upward . On all sides blackarcheddoorways opened into the great still hall . It was lit by curiousbronze lamps that gave a dim weird light . On the other side of the great hall a broad black marble stairway , without a railing , marched upward to lose itself in gloom , and above him on all sides dim galleries hung like black stone ledges . Conan shivered ; he was in a temple of some Stygian god , if not Set himself , then someone only less grim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of the great hall stood a black stone altar , massive , somber , without carvings or ornament , and upon it coiled one of the great sacred serpents , its iridescent scales shimmering in the lamplight . It did not move , and Conan rememberedstories that the priests kept these creatures drugged part of the time . The Cimmerian took an uncertain step out from the door , then shrank back suddenly , not into the room he had just quitted , but into a velvet-curtained recess . He had heard a soft step somewhere near by . From one of the black arches emerged a tall , powerful figure in sandals and silken loin-cloth , with a wide mantle trailing from his shoulders . But face and head were hidden by a monstrous mask , a half-bestial , half-human countenance , from the crest of which floated a mass of ostrich plumes.  |p151In  certain ceremonies the Stygian priests went masked . Conan hoped the man would not discover him , but some instinct warned the Stygian . He turned abruptly from his destination , which apparently was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jerked aside the velvet hanging , a hand darted from the shadows , crushed the cry in his throat and jerked him headlong into the alcove , and the knife impaled him . Conan 's next move was the obvious one suggested by logic . He lifted off the grinning mask and drew it over his own head . The fisherman 's mantle he flung over the body of the priest , which he concealed behind the hangings , and drew the priestly mantle about his own brawny shoulders . Fate had given him a disguise . All Khemi might well be searching now for the blasphemer who dared defend himself against a sacred snake ; but who would dream of looking for him under the mask of a priest ? He strode boldly from the alcove and headed for one of the arched doorways at random ; but he had not taken a dozen strides when he wheeled again , all his senses edged for peril . A band of masked figures filed down the stair , appareled exactly as he was . He hesitated , caught in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though cold sweat gathered on his forehead and the backs of his hands . No word was spoken . Like phantomsthey descended into the great hall and moved past him toward a black arch . The leader carried an ebon staff which supported a grinning white skull , and Conan knew it was one of the ritualistic processions so inexplicable to a foreigner , but which played a strong  --  and often sinister  --  part in the Stygian religion . The last figure turned his head slightly toward the motionless Cimmerian , as if expecting him to follow . Not to do what was obviously expected of him would rouse instant suspicion . Conan fell in behind the last man and suited his gait to their measured pace . They traversed a long , dark , vaulted corridor in which , Conan noticed uneasily , the skull on the staff glowed phosphorescently . He felt a surge of unreasoning , wild animal panic that urged him to rip out his knife and slash right and left at these uncanny figures , to flee madly from this grim , dark temple . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitions that rose in the back of his mind and peopled the gloom with shadowy shapes of horror ; and presently he barely stifled a sigh of relief asp152they filed through a great double-valved door which was three times higher than a man , and emerged into the starlight . Conan wondered if he dared fade into some dark alley ; but hesitated , uncertain , and down the long dark street they padded silently , while such folk as they met turned their heads away and fled from them . The procession kept far out from the walls ; to turn and bolt into any of the alleys they passed would be too conspicuous . While he mentally fumed and cursed , they came to a low-arched gateway in the southern wall , and through this they filed . Ahead of them and about them lay clusters of low , flattoppedmud houses , and palm-groves , shadowy in the starlight . Now if ever , thought Conan , was his time to escape his silent companions . But the moment the gate was left behind them those companionswere no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The measured , ritualistic gait was abandoned , the staff with its skull was tucked unceremoniously under the leader 's arm , and the whole group broke ranks and hurried onward . And Conan hurried with them . For in the low murmur of speech he had caught a word that galvanized him . The word was : " Thu-tothmes ! "  |p153CONAN  STARED WITH burning interest at his masked companions . One of them was Thutothmes , or else the destination of the band was a rendezvous with the man he sought . And he knew what the destination was , when beyond the palms he glimpsed a black triangularbulk looming against the shadowy sky . They passed through the belt of huts and groves , and if any man saw them he was careful not to show himself . The huts were dark . Behind them the black towers of Khemi rose gloomily against the stars that were mirrored in the waters of the harbor ; ahead of them the desert stretched away in dim darkness ; somewherea jackal yapped . The quick-passing sandals of the silent neophytesmade no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving toward that colossal pyramid that rose out of the murk of the desert . There was no sound over all the sleeping land . Conan 's heart beat quicker as he gazed at the grim black wedge that stood etched against the stars , and his impatience to close with Thutothmes in whatever conflict the meeting might mean was not unmixed with a fear of the unknown . No man could approach one of those somber piles of black stone without apprehension . The very name was a symbol of repellent horror among the northernnations , and legends hinted that the Stygians did not build them ; that they were in the land at whatever immeasurably ancientdate the dark-skinned people came into the land of the great river . As they approached the pyramid he glimpsed a dim glow near the base which presently resolved itself into a doorway , on either side of which brooded stone lions with the heads of women , cryptic , inscrutable , nightmares crystallized in stone . The leader of the band made straight for the doorway , in the deep well of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant beside this dim figure , and then vanished into the dark interior , and one by one the others followed . As each masked priest passed through the gloomy portal he was halted briefly by the mysterious guardian and something passed between them , some word or gesture Conan could not make out . Seeing this , the Cimmerian purposely lagged behind , and stooping , pretended to be fumbling with the fastening of hisp154sandal . Not until the last of the masked figures had disappeared did he straighten and approach the portal . He was uneasily wondering if the guardian of the temple were human , remembering some tales he had heard . But his doubts were set at rest . A dim bronze cresset glowing just within the door lighted a long narrow corridor that ran away into blackness , and a man standing silent in the mouth of it , wrapped in a wide black cloak . No one else was in sight . Obviously the masked priests had disappeared down the corridor . Over the cloak that was drawn about his lower features , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand he made a curious gesture . On a venture Conan imitated it . But evidently another gesture was expected ; the Stygian 's right hand came from under his cloak with a gleam of steel and his murderousstab would have pierced the heart of an ordinary man . But he was dealing with one whose thews were nerved to the quickness of a jungle cat . Even as the dagger flashed in the dim light , Conan caught the dusky wrist and smashed his clenched right fist against the Stygian 's jaw . The man 's head went back against the stone wall with a dull crunch that told of a fractured skull . Standing for an instant above him , Conan listened intently . The cresset burned low , casting vague shadows about the door . Nothingstirred in the blackness about the door . Nothing stirred in the blackness beyond , though far away and below him , as it seemed , he caught the faint , muffled note of a gong . He stooped and dragged the body behind the great bronze door which stood wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly down the corridor , toward what doom he did not even try to guess . He had not gone far when he halted , baffled . The corridor split in two branches , and he had no way of knowing which the masked priests had taken . At a venture he chose the left . The floor slanted slightly downward and worn smooth as by many feet . Here and there a dim cresset cast a faint nightmarish twilight . Conan wondereduneasily for what purpose these colossal piles had been reared , in what forgotten age . This was an ancient , ancient land . No man knew how many ages the black temples of Stygia looked against the stars . Narrow black arches opened occasionally to right and left , but he kept to the main corridor , although a conviction that he hadp155taken the wrong branch was growing in him . Even with their start on him , he should have overtaken the priests by this time . He was growing nervous . The silence was like a tangible thing , and yet he had a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nighted arch he seemed to feel the glare of unseen eyes fixed upon him . He paused , half minded to turn back to where the corridor had first branched . He wheeled abruptly , knife lifted , every nerve tingling . A girl stood at the mouth of a smaller tunnel , staring fixedly at him . Her ivory skin showed her to be Stygian of some ancient noble family , and like all such women she was tall , lithe , voluptuouslyfigured , her hair a great pile of black foam , among which gleamed a sparkling ruby . But for her velvet sandals and broad jewel-crusted girdle about her supple waist she was quite nude . " What do you here ? " she demanded . To answer would betray his alien origin . He remained motionless , a grim , somber figure in the hideous mask with the plumes floating over him . His alert gaze sought the shadows behind her and found them empty . But there might be hordes of fightingmenwithin her call . She advanced toward him , apparently without apprehension though with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You are a fighting-man . Even with that mask that is plain . There is as much difference between you and a priest as there is between a man and a woman . By Set ! " she exclaimed , halting suddenly , her eyes flaring wide . " I do not believe you are even a Stygian ! " With a movement too quick for the eye to follow , his hand closed about her round throat , lightly as a caress . " Not a sound out of you ! " he muttered . Her smooth ivory flesh was cold as marble , yet there was no fear in the wide , dark , marvelous eyes which regarded him . " Do not fear , " she answered calmly . " I will not betray you . But you are mad to come , a stranger and a foreigner , to the forbidden temple of Set ? " " I 'm looking for the priest Thutothmes , " he answered . " Is he in this temple ? " " Why do you seek him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine which was stolen . " " I will lead you to him , " she volunteered , so promptly that his suspicions were instantly aroused.  | " Do n't play with me , girl , " he growled . " I do not play with you . I have no love for Thutothmes . " He hesitated , then made up his mind ; after all , he was in her power as she was in his . " Walk beside me , " he commanded , shifting his grasp from her throat to her wrist . " But walk with care . If you make a move  --  " She led him down the slanting corridor , down and down , until there were no more cressets , and he groped his way in darkness , aware less by sight than by feel and sense of the woman at his side . Once when he spoke to her , she turned her head toward him and he was startled to see her eyes glowing like golden fire in the dark . Dim doubts and vague monstrous suspicions haunted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze of black corridors that confused even his primitive sense of direction . He mentally cursed himself for a fool , allowing himself to be led into that black abode of mystery ; but it was too late to turn back now . Again he felt life and movement in the darkness about him , sensed peril and hunger burning impatiently in the blackness . Unlesshis ears deceived him he caught a faint sliding noise that ceased and receded at a muttered command from the girl . She led him at last into a chamber lighted by a curious sevenbranchedcandelabrum in which black candles burned weirdly . He knew they were far below the earth . The chamber was square , with walls and ceilings of polished black marble and furnished after the manner of the ancient Stygians ; there was a couch of ebony , covered with black velvet , and on a black stone dais lay a carvers mummy-case . Conan stood waiting expectantly , staring at the various black arches which opened into the chamber . But the girl made no move to go farther . Stretching herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers behind her sleek head and regarded him from under long , drooping lashes . " Well ? " he demanded impatiently . " What are you doing ? Where 's Thutothmes ? " " There is no haste , " she answered lazily . " What is an hour  --  or a day , or a year , or a century , for that matter ? Take off your mask . Let me see your features . " With a grunt of annoyance Conan dragged off the bulky headpiece , and the girl nodded as if in approval as she scanned his dark scarred face and blazing eyes.  | " There is strength in you  --  great strength ; you could strangle a bullock . " He moved restlessly , his suspicion growing . With his hand on his hilt he peered into the gloomy arches . " If you 've brought me into a trap , " he said , " you wo n't live to enjoy your handiwork . Are you going to get off that couch and do as you promised , or do I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mummy-case , on which the countenance of the occupant was carved in ivory with the startling vividness of a forgotten art . There was a disquieting familiarity about that carven mask , and with something of a shock he realized what it was ; there was a startling resemblance between it and the face of the girl lolling on the ebon couch . She might have been the model from which it was carved , but he knew the portrait was at least centuries old . Archaic hieroglyphics were scrawled across the lacquered lid , and , seeking back into his mind for tag-ends of learning , picked up here and there as incidentals of an adventurous life , he spelled them out , and said aloud : " Akiva-sha ! " " You have heard of Princess Akivasha ? " inquired the girl on the couch . " Who has n't ? " he grunted . The name of that ancient , evil , beautifulprincess still lived the world over in song and legend , though ten thousand years had rolled their cycles since the daughter of Tuthamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancientLuxur . " Her only sin was that she loved life and all the meanings of life , " said the Stygian girl . " To win life she courted death . She could not bear to think of growing old and shriveled and worn , and dying at last as hags die . She wooed Darkness like a lover and his gift was life  --  life that , not being life as mortals know it , can never grow old and fade . She went into the shadows to cheat age and death  --  " Conan glared at her with eyes that were suddenly burning slits . And he wheeled and tore the lid from the sarcophagus . It was empty . Behind him the girl was laughing and the sound froze the blood in his veins . He whirled back to her , the short hairs on his neck bristling . " You are Akivasha ! " he grated . She laughed and shook back her burnished locks , spread her arms sensuously.  | " I am Akivasha ! I am the woman who never died , who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth by the gods , in the full bloom of her youth and beauty , to queen it for ever in some celestial clime ! Nay , it is in the shadows that mortals find immortality ! Ten thousand years ago I died to live for ever ! Give me your lips , strong man ! " Rising lithely she came to him , rose on tiptoe and flung her arms about his massive neck . Scowling down into her upturned , beautiful countenance he was aware of a fearful fascination and an icy fear . " Love me ! " she whispered , her head thrown back , eyes closed and lips parted . " Give me of your blood to renew my youth and perpetuate my everlasting life ! I will make you , too , immortal ! I will teach you the wisdom of all the ages , all the secrets that have lasted out the eons in the blackness beneath these dark temples . I will make you king of that shadowy horde which revel among the tombs of the ancients when night veils the desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests and magicians , and captive girls dragged screaming through the portals of death . I desire a man . Love me , barbarian ! " She pressed her dark head down against his mighty breast , and he felt a sharp pang at the base of his throat . With a curse he tore her away and flung her sprawling across the couch . " Damned vampire ! " Blood was trickling from a tiny wound in his throat . She reared up on the couch like a serpent poised to strike , all the golden fires of hell blazing in her wide eyes . Her lips drew back , revealing white pointed teeth . " Fool ! " she shrieked . " Do you think to escape me ? You will live and die in darkness ! I have brought you far below the temple . You can never find your way out alone . You can never cut your way through those which guard the tunnels . But for my protection the sons of Set would long ago have taken you into their bellies . Fool , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me or I 'll slash you asunder , " he grunted , his flesh crawling with revulsion . " You may be immortal , but steel will dismember you . " As he backed toward the arch through which he had entered , the light went out suddenly . All the candles were extinguished at once , though he did not know how ; for Akivasha had not touched them . But the vampire 's laugh rose mockingly behind him , poison ..  |p159sweet  as the viols of hell , and he sweated as he groped in the darkness for the arch in a near-panic . His fingers encountered an opening and he plunged through it . Whether it was the arch through which he had entered he did not know , nor did he very much care . His one thought was to get out of the haunted chamberwhich had housed that beautiful , hideous , undead fiend for so many centuries . His wanderings through those black , winding tunnels , were a sweating nightmare . Behind him and about him he heard faint slitherings and glidings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had heard in the chamber of Akivasha . He slashed ferociously at sounds and movements he heard or imagined he heard in the darkness near him , and once his sword cut through some yielding tenuous substance that might have been cobwebs . He had a desperate feeling that he was being played with , lured deeper and deeper into ultimate night , before being set upon by demoniac talon and fang . And through his fear ran the sickening revulsion of his discovery . The legend of Akivasha was so old , and among the evil tales told of her ran a thread of beauty and idealism , of everlasting youth . To so many dreamers and poets and lovers she was not alone the evil princess of Stygian legend , but the symbol of eternal youth and beauty , shining for ever in some far realm of the gods . And this was the hideous reality . This foul perversion was the truth of that everlasting life . Through his physical revulsion ran the sense of a shattered dream of man 's idolatry , its glittering gold proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , a dim fear of the falseness of all men 's dreams and idolatries . And now he knew that his ears were not playing him tricks . He was being followed , and his pursuers were closing in on him . In the darkness sounded shufflings and slidings that were never made by human feet ; no , nor by the feet of any normal animal . The underworld had its bestial life too , perhaps . They were behind him . He turned to face them , though he could see nothing , and slowly backed away . Then the sounds eased , even before he turned his head and saw , somewhere down the long corridor , a glow of light.  |p160CONAN  MOVED CAUTIOUSLY in the direction of the light he hadseen , his ear cocked over his shoulder , but there was no further sound of pursuit , though he felt the darkness pregnant with sentientlife . The glow was not stationary ; it moved , bobbing grotesquely along . Then he saw the source . The tunnel he was traversing crossed another , wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter tunnel filed a bizarre procession four tall , gaunt men in black , hooded robes , leaning on staffs . The leader held a torch above his head  --  a torch that burned with a curious steady glow . Like phantoms they passed across his limited range of vision and vanished , with only a fading glow to tell of their passing . Their appearance was indescribably eldritch . They were not Stygians , not anything Conan had ever seen . He doubted if they were even humans . They were like black ghosts , stalking ghoulishly along the haunted tunnels . But his position could be no more desperate than it was . Before the inhuman feet behind him could resume their slithering advanceat the fading of the distant illumination , Conan was running down the corridor . He plunged into the other tunnel and saw , far down it , small in the distance , the weird procession moving in the glowing sphere . He stole noiselessly after them , then shrank suddenlyback against the wall as he saw them halt and cluster together as if conferring on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he slipped into the nearest archway . Groping in the darkness to which he had become so accustomed that he could all but see through it , he discovered that the tunnel did not run straight , but meandered , and he fell back beyond the first turn , so that the light of the strangers should not fall on him as they passed . But as he stood there , he was aware of a low hum of sound from somewhere behind him , like the murmur of human voices . Moving down the corridor in that direction , he confirmed his first suspicion . Abandoning his original intention of following the ghoulish travelers to whatever destination might be theirs , he set out in the direction of the voices . Presently he saw a glint of light ahead of him , and turning into the corridor from which it issued , saw a broad arch filled with ap161dim glow at the other end . On his left a narrow stone stair went upward , and instinctive caution prompted him to turn and mount the stair . The voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sounds fell away beneath him as he climbed , and presently he came out through a low arched door into a vast open space glowing with a weird radiance . He was standing on a shadowy gallery from which he looked down into a broad dim-lit hall of colossal proportions . It was a hall of the dead , which few ever see but the silent priests of Stygia . Along the black walls rose tier above tier of carven , painted sarcophagi . Each stood in a niche in the dusky stone , and the tiers mounted up and up to be lost in the gloom above . Thousands of carven masks stared impassively down upon the group in the midst of the hall , rendered futile and insignificant by that vast array of the dead . Of this group ten were priests , and though they had discarded their masks Conan knew they were the priests he had accompaniedto the pyramid . They stood before a tall , hawk-faced man beside a black altar on which lay a mummy in rotting swathings . And the altar seemed to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shimmered , dripping flakes of quivering golden flame on the black stone about it . This dazzling glow emanated from a great red jewel which lay upon the altar , and in the reflection of which the faces of the priests looked ashy and corpse-like . As he looked , Conan felt the pressure of all the weary leagues and the weary nights and days of his long quest , and he trembled with the mad urge to rush among those silent priests , clear his way with mighty blows of naked steel , and grasp the red gem with passiontautfingers . But he gripped himself with iron control , and crouched down in the shadow of the stone balustrade . A glance showed him that a stair led down into the hall from the gallery , hugging the wall and half hidden in the shadows . He glared into the dimness of the vast place , seeking other priests or votaries , but saw only the group about the altar . In that great emptiness the voice of the man beside the altar sounded hollow and ghostly : " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night wind whisperedit , the ravens croaked of it as they flew , and the grim bats told it to the owls and the serpents that lurk in hoary ruins . Were/wolf and vampire knew , and the ebon-bodied demons that prowl by night . The sleeping Night of the World stirred and shook its heavy mane , and there began a throbbing of drums in deep . darkness , and the echoes of far weird cries frightened men who walked by dusk . For the Heart of Ahriman had come again into the world to fulfill its cryptic destiny . " Ask me not how I , Thutothmes of Khemi and the Night , heard the word before Thoth-Amon who calls himself prince of all wizards . There are secrets not meet for such ears even as yours , and Thoth-Amon is not the only lord of the Black Ring . " I knew , and I went to meet the Heart which came southward . It was like a magnet which drew me , unerringly . From death to death it came , riding on a river of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its power is greatest when there is blood on the hands that grasp it , when it is wrested by slaughter from its holder . Wherever it gleams , blood is spilt and kingdoms totter , and the forces of nature are put in turmoil . " And here I stand , the master of the Heart , and have summonedyou to come secretly , who are faithful to me , to share in the black kingdom that shall be . Tonight you shall witness the breaking of Thoth-Amon 's chains which enslave us , and the birth of empire . " Who am I , even I , Thutothmes , to know what powers lurk and dream in those crimson deeps ? It holds secrets forgotten for three thousand years . But I shall learn . These shall tell me ! " He waved his hand toward the silent shapes that lined the hall . " See how they sleep , staring through their carven masks ! Kings , queens , generals , priests , wizards , the dynasties and the nobility of Stygia for ten thousand years ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumber . Long , long the Heart throbbed and pulsed in ancient Stygia . Here was its home in the centuries before it journeyed to Acheron . The ancients knew its full power , and they will tell me when by its magic I restore them to life to labor for me . " I will rouse them , will waken them , will learn their forgotten wisdom , the knowledge locked in those withered skulls . By the lore of the dead we shall enslave the living ! Aye , kings , and generalsand wizards of eld shall be our helpers and our slaves . Who shall stand before us ? " Look ! This dried , shriveled thing on the altar was once Thothmekri , a high priest of Set , who died three thousand years ago . Hep163was an adept of the Black Ring . He knew of the Heart . He will tell us of its powers . " Lifting the great jewel , the speaker laid it on the withered breast of the mummy , and lifted his hand as he began an incantation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his lips parted he froze , glaring past his acolytes , and they wheeled to stare in the direction in which he was looking . Through the black arch of a door four gaunt , black-robed shapes had filed into the great hall . Their faces were dim yellow ovals in the shadows of their hoods . " Who are you ? " ejaculated Thutothmes in a voice as pregnant with danger as the hiss of a cobra . " Are you mad , to invade the holy shrine of Set ? " The tallest of the strangers spoke , and his voice was toneless as a Khitan temple bell . " We follow Conan of Aquilonia . " " He is not here , " answered Thutothmes , shaking back his mantlefrom his right hand with a curious menacing gesture , like a panther unsheathing his talons . " You lie . He is in this temple . We tracked him from a corpse behind the bronze door of the outer portal through a maze of corridors . We were following his devious trail when we became aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But first give us the Heart of Ahriman . " " Death is the portion of madmen , " murmured Thutothmes , moving nearer the speaker . His priests closed in on cat-like feet , but the strangers did not appear to heed . " Who can look upon it without desire ? " said the Khitan . " In Khitai we have heard of it . It will give us power over the people which cast us out . Glory and wonder dream in its crimson deeps . Give it to us , before we slay you . " A fierce cry rang out as a priest leaped with a flicker of steel . Before he could strike , a scaly staff licked out and touched his breast , and he fell as a dead man falls . In an instant the mummies were staring down on a scene of blood and horror . Curved knives flashed and crimsoned , snaky staffs licked in and out , and whenever they touched a man , that man screamed and died . At the first stroke Conan had bounded up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that brief , fiendish fight  --  saw men swaying , locked in battle and streaming blood ; saw one Khitan , fairly hacked to pieces , yet still on his feet and dealingp164death , when Thutothmes smote him on the breast with his open empty hand , and he dropped dead , though naked steel had not been enough to destroy his uncanny vitality . By the time Conan 's hurtling feet left the stair , the fight was all but over . Three of the Khitans were down , and slashed and cut to ribbons and disemboweled , but of the Stygians only Thutothmes remained on his feet . He rushed at the remaining Khitan , his empty hand lifted like a weapon , and that hand was black as that of a negro . But before he could strike , the staff in the tall Khitan 's hand licked out , seeming to elongate itself as the yellow man thrust . The point touched the bosom of Thutothmes and he staggered ; again and yet again the staff licked out , and Thutothmes reeled and fell dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the whole of him the same hue as his enchanted hand . The Khitan turned toward the jewel that burned on the breast of the mummy , but Conan was before him . In a tense stillness the two faced each other , amid that shambles , with the carven mammies staring down upon them . " Far have I followed you , oh king of Aquilonia , " said the Khitancalmly . " Down the long river , and over the mountains , across Poitain and Zingara and through the hills of Argos and down the coast . Not easily did we pick up on your trail from Tarantia , for the priests of Asura are crafty . We lost it in Zingara , but we found your helmet in the forest below the border hills , where you had fought with the ghouls of the forests . Almost we lost the trail tonightamong these labyrinths . " Conan reflected that he had been fortunate in returning from the vampire 's chamber by another route than that by which he had been led to it . Otherwise he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from afar as they smelled out his spoor like human bloodhounds , with whatever uncanny gift was theirs . The Khitan shook his head slightly , as if reading his mind . " That is meaningless ; the long trail ends here . " " Why have you hounded me ? " demanded Conan , poised to move in any direction with the celerity of a hair-trigger . " It was a debt to pay , " answered the Khitan . " To you who are about to die , I will not withhold knowledge . We were vassals of the king of Aquilonia , Valerius . Long we served him , but of that service we are free now  --  my brothers by death , and I by thep165fulfilment of obligation . I shall return to Aquilonia with two hearts ; for myself the Heart of Ahriman ; for Valerius the heart of Conan . A kiss of the staff that was cut from the living Tree of Death  --  " The staff licked out like the dart of a viper , but the slash of Conan 's knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was another fficker of the keen steel like a jet of lightning , and the head of the Khitan rolled to the floor . Conan wheeled and extended his hand toward the jewel  --  then he shrank back , his hair bristling , his blood congealing icily . For no longer a withered brown thing lay on the altar . The jewel shimmered on the full , arching breast of a naked , living man who lay among the moldering bandages . Living ? Conan could not decide . The eyes were like dark murky glass under which shone inhuman somber fires . Slowly the man rose , taking the jewel in his hand . He towered beside the altar , dusky , naked , with a face like a carven image . Mutely he extended his hand toward Conan , with the jewel throbbinglike a living heart within it . Conan took it , with an eery sensation of receiving gifts from the hand of the dead . He somehow realized that the proper incantations had not been made  --  the conjurement had not been completed  --  life had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " demanded the Cimmerian . The answer came in a toneless monotone , like the dripping of water from stalactites in subterranean caverns . " I was Thothmekri ; I am dead . " " Well , lead me out of this accursed temple , will you ? " Conan requested , his flesh crawling . With measured , mechanical steps the dead man moved toward a black arch . Conan followed him . A glance back showed him once again the vast , shadowy hall with its tiers of sarcophagi , the dead men sprawled about the altar ; the head of the Khitan he had slain stared sightless up at the sweeping shadows . The glow of the jewel illuminated the black tunnels like an ensorceledlamp , dripping golden fire . Once Conan caught a glimpse of ivory flesh in the shadows , believed he saw the vampire that was Akivasha shrinking back from the glow of the jewel ; and with her , other less human shapes scuttled or shambled into the darkness . The dead man strode straight on , looking neither to right norp166left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cold sweat gathered thick on Conan 's flesh . Icy doubts assailed him . How could he know that this terrible figure out of the past was leading him to freedom ? But he knew that , left to himself , he could never untangle this bewitched maze of corridors and tunnels . He followed his awful guide through blackness that loomed before and behind them and was filled with skulking shapes of horror and lunacythat cringed from the blinding glow of the Heart . Then the bronze doorway was before him , and Conan felt the night wind blowing across the desert , and saw the stars , and the starlit desert across which streamed the great black shadow of the pyramid . Thothmekri pointed silently into the desert , and then turned and stalked soundlessly back in the darkness . Conan stared after that silent figure that receded into the blackness on soundless , inexorable feet as one that moves to a known and inevitable doom , or returns to everlasting sleep . With a curse the Cimmerian leaped from the doorway and fled into the desert as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid , or toward the black towers of Khemi looming dimly across the sands . He headed southward toward the coast , and he ran as a man runs in ungovernable panic . The violent exertionshook his brain free of black cobwebs ; the clean desert wind blew the nightmares from his soul and his revulsion changed to a wild tide of exultation before the desert gave way to a tangle of swampy growth through which he saw the black water lying before him , and the Venturer at anchor . He plunged through the undergrowth , hip-deep in the marshes ; dived headlong into the deep water , heedless of sharks or crocodiles , and swam to the galley and was clambering up the chain on to the deck , dripping and exultant , before the watch saw him . " Awake , you dogs ! " roared Conan , knocking aside the spear the startled lookout thrust at his breast . " Heave up the anchor ! Lay to the doors ! Give that fisherman a helmet full of gold and put him ashore ! Dawn will soon be breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest port of Zingara ! " He whirled about his head the great jewel , which threw off splashes of light that spotted the deck with golden fire.  |p167WINTER  HAD PASSED from Aquilonia . Leaves sprang out on the limbs of trees , and the fresh grass smiled to the touch of the warm southern breezes . But many a field lay idle and empty , many a charred heap of ashes marked the spot where proud villas or prosperoustowns had stood . Wolves prowled openly along the grassgrownhighways , and bands of gaunt , masterless men slunk through the forests . Only in Tarantia was feasting and wealth and pageantry . Valerius ruled like one touched with madness . Even many of the barons who had welcomed his return cried out at last against him . His tax-gatherers crushed rich and poor alike ; the wealth of a looted kingdom poured into Tarantia , which became less like the capital of a realm than the garrison of conquerors in a conquered land . Its merchants waxed rich , but it was a precarious prosperity ; for none knew when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his property confiscated , himself cast into prison or brought to the bloody block . Valerius made no attempt to conciliate his subjects . He maintainedhimself by means of the Nemedian soldiery and by desperatemercenaries . He knew himself to be a puppet of Amalric . He knew that he ruled only on the sufferance of the Nemedian . He knew that he could never hope to unite Aquilonia under his rule and cast off the yoke of his masters , for the outland provinces would resist him to the last drop of blood . And for that matter the Nemedians would cast him from his throne if he made attempt to consolidate his kingdom . He was caught in his own vise . The gall of defeated pride corroded his soul , and he threw himself into a reign of debauchery , as one who lives from day to day , without thought or care for tomorrow . Yet there was subtlety in his madness , so deep that not even Amalric guessed it . Perhaps the wild , chaotic years of wandering as an exile had bred in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his present position increased this bitterness to a kind of madness . At any event he lived with one desire : to cause the ruin of all who associated with him . He knew that his rule would be over the instant he had served Amalric 's purpose ; he knew , too , that so long as he continued to oppress his native kingdom the Nemedian would suffer him top168reign , for Amalric wished to crush Aquilonia into ultimate submission , to destroy its last shred of independence , and then at last to seize it himself , rebuild it after his own fashion with his vast wealth , and use its men and natural resources to wrest the crown of Nemedia from Tarascus . For the throne of an emperor was Amalric 's ultimate ambition , and Valerius knew it . Valerius did not know whether Tarascus suspected this , but he knew that the king of Nemedia approved of his ruthless course . Tarascus hated Aquilonia , with a hate born of old wars . He desired only the destruction of the western kingdom . And Valerius intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wealth could ever rebuild it . He hated the baron quite as much as he hated the Aquilonians , and hoped only to live to see the day when Aquilonia lay in utter ruin , and Tarascus and Amalric were locked in hopeless civil war that would as cornpetelydestroy Nemedia . He believed that the conquest of the still defiant provinces of Gunderland and Poitain and the Bossonian marches would mark his end as king . He would then have served Amalric 's purpose , and could be discarded . So he delayed the conquest of these provinces , confining his activities to objectless raids and forays , meetingAmalric 's urges for action with all sorts of plausible objections and postponements . His life was a series of feasts and wild debauches . He filled his palace with the fairest girls of the kingdom , willing or unwilling . He blasphemed the gods and sprawled drunken on the floor of the banquet hall wearing the golden crown , and staining his royal purplerobes with the wine he spilled . In gusts of blood-lust he festoonedthe gallows in the market square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent his Nemedian horsemen thundering through the land pillaging and burning . Driven to madness , the land was in a constant upheaval of frantic revolt , savagely suppressed . Valerius plundered and raped and looted and destroyed until even Amalric protested , warning him that he would beggar the kingdom beyond repair , not knowing that such was his fixed determination . But while in both Aquilonia and Nemedia men talked of the madness of the king , in Nemedia men talked much of Xaltotun , the masked one . Yet few saw him on the streets of Belverus . Men said he spent much time in the hills , in curious conclaves with survivingremnants of an old race : dark , silent folk who claimed de/scent from an ancient kingdom . Men whispered of drums beating far up in the dreaming hills , of fires glowing in the darkness , and strange chantings borne on the winds , chantings and rituals forgottencenturies ago except as meaningless formulas mumbled besidemountain hearths in villages whose inhabitants differed strangely from the people of the valleys . The reason for these conclaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied the Pythonian , and on whose countenance a haggard shadow was growing . But in the full flood of spring a sudden whisper passed over the sinking kingdom that woke the land to eager life . It came like a murmurous wind drifting up from the south , waking men sunk in the apathy of despair . Yet how it first came none could truly say . Some spoke of a strange , grim old woman who came down from the mountains with her hair flowing in the wind , and a great gray wolf following her like a dog . Others whispered of the priests of Asura who stole like furtive phantoms from Gunderland to the marches of Poitain , and to the forest villages of the Bossonians . However the word came , revolt ran like a flame along the borders . Outlying Nemedian garrisons were stormed and put to the sword , foraging parties were cut to pieces ; the west was up in arms , and there was a different air about the rising , a fierce resolutionand inspired wrath rather than the frantic despair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common people ; barons were fortifying their castles and hurling defiance at the governors of the provinces . Bands of Bossonians were seen movingalong the edges of the marches : stocky , resolute men in brigandines and steel caps , with longbows in their hands . From the inert stagnation of dissolution and ruin the realm was suddenlyalive , vibrant and dangerous . So Amalric sent in haste for Tarascus , who came with an army . In the royal palace in Tarantia the two kings and Amalric discussed the rising . They had not sent for Xaltotun , immersed in his cryptic studies in the Nemedian hills . Not since that bloody day in the valley of the Valkia had they called upon him for aid of his magic , and he had drawn apart , communing but little with them , apparently indifferent to their intrigues . Nor had they sent for Orastes , but he came , and he was white as spume blown before the storm . He stood in the gold-domed chamber where the kings held conclave and they beheld in amaze/ment his haggard stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orastes could hold . " You are weary , Orastes , " said Amalric . " Sit upon this divan and I will have a slave fetch you wine . You have ridden hard  --  " Orastes waved aside the invitation . " I have killed three horses on the road from Belverus . I can not drink wine , I can not rest , until I have said what I have to say . " He paced back and forth as if some inner fire would not let him stand motionless , and halting before his wondering companions : " When we employed the Heart of Ahriman to bring a dead man back to life , " Orastes said abruptly , " we did not weigh the consequences of tampering in the black dust of the past . The fault is mine , and the sin . We thought only of our four ambitions , forgettingwhat ambitions this man might himself have . And we have loosed a demon upon the earth , a fiend inexplicable to common humanity . I have plumbed deep in evil , but there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race and age , can go . My ancestors were clean men , without any demoniacal taint ; it is only I who have sunk into the pits , and I can sin only to the extent of my personal individuality . Out behind Xaltotun lie a thousand centuries of black magic and diabolism , an ancient tradition of evil . He is beyond our conception not only because he is a wizard himself , but also because he is the son of a race of wizards . " I have seen things that have blasted my soul . In the heart of the slumbering hills I have watched Xaltotun commune with the souls of the damned , and invoke the ancient demons of forgotten Acheron . I have seen the accursed descendants of that accursed empire worship him and hail him as their arch-priest . I have seen what he plots  --  and I tell you it is no less than the restoration of the ancient , black , grisly kingdom of Acheron ! " " What do you mean ? " demanded Amalric . " Acheron is dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even Xaltotuncan reshape the dust of three thousand years . " " You know little of his black powers , " answered Orastes grimly . " I have seen the very hills take on an alien and ancient aspectunder the spell of his incantations . I have glimpsed , like shadows behind the realities , the dim shapes and outlines of valleys , forests , mountains and lakes that are not as they are today , but as they were in that dim yesterday  --  have even sensed , rather than glimpsed , the purple towers of forgotten Python shimmering like figures of mist in the dusk.  | " And in the last conclave to which I accompanied him , understandingof his sorcery came to me at last , while the drums beat and the beast-like worshippers howled with their heads in the dust . I tell you he would restore Acheron by his magic , by the sorceryof a gigantic blood-sacrifice such as the world has never seen . He would enslave the world , and with a deluge of blood wash away the present and restore the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mad ? " Orastes turned a haggard stare upon him . " Can any man see what I have seen and remain wholly sane ? Yet I speak the truth . He plots the return of Acheron , with its towers and wizardsand kings and horrors , as it was in the long ago . The descendantsof Acheron will serve him as a nucleus upon which to build , but it is the blood and the bodies of the people of the world today that will furnish the mortar and the stones for the rebuilding . I can not tell you how . My own brain reels when I try to understand . But I have seen ! Acheron will be Acheron again , and even the hills , the forests and the rivers will resume their ancient aspect . Why not ? If I , with my tiny store of knowledge , could bring to life a man dead three thousand years , why can not the greatest wizard of the world bring back to life a kingdom dead three thousand years ? Out of the dust shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we thwart him ? " asked Tarascus , impressed . " There is but one way , " answered Orastes . " We must steal the Heart of Ahriman ! " " But I  --  " began Tarascus involuntarily , then closed his mouth quickly . None had noticed him , and Orastes was continuing . " It is a power that can be used against him . With it in my hands I might defy him . But how shall we steal it ? He has it hidden in some secret place , from which not even a Zamorian thief might filch it . I can not learn its hiding-place . If he would only sleep again the sleep of the black lotus  --  but the last time he slept thus was after the battle of the Valkia , when he was weary because of the great magic he had performed , and  --  " The door was locked and bolted , but it swung silently open and Xaltotun stood before them , calm , tranquil , stroking his patriarchalbeard ; but the lambent lights of hell flickered in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said calmly , pointing a finger like an index of doom at Orastes . And before any could move , hep172had cast a handful of dust on the floor near the feet of the priest , who stood like a man turned to marble . It flamed , smoldered ; a blue serpentine of smoke rose and swayed upward about Orastes in a slender spiral . And when it had risen above his shoulders it curled about his neck with a whipping suddenness like the stroke of a snake . Orastes ' scream was choked to a gurgle . His hands flew to his neck , his eyes were distended , his tongue protruded . The smoke was like a blue rope about his neck ; then it faded and was gone , and Orastes slumped to the floor a dead man . Xaltotun smote his hands together and two men entered , men often observed accompanying him  --  small , repulsively dark , with red , oblique eyes and pointed , rat-like teeth . They did not speak . Lifting the corpse , they bore it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xaltotun seated himself at the ivory table about which sat the pale kings . " Why are you in conclave ? " he demanded . " The Aquilonians have risen in the west , " answered Amalric , recovering from the grisly jolt the death of Orastes had given him . " The fools believe that Conan is alive , and coming at the head of a Poitanian army to reclaim his kingdom . If he had reappeared immediately after Valkia , or if a rumor had been circulated that he lived , the central provinces would not have risen under him , they feared your powers so . But they have become so desperate under Valerius 's misrule that they are ready to follow any man who can unite them against us , and prefer sudden death to torture and continual misery . " Of course the tale has lingered stubbornly in the land that Conan was not really slain at Valkia , but not until recently have the masses accepted it . But Pallantides is back from exile in Ophir , swearing that the king was ill in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness , and a squire who but recently recovered from the stroke of a mace received at Valkia confirms his tale  --  or pretends to . " An old woman with a pet wolf has wandered up and down the land , proclaiming that King Conan yet lives , and will return some day to reclaim the crown . And of late the cursed priests of Asura sing the same song . They claim that word has come to them by some mysterious means that Conan is returning to reconquer his domain . I can not catch either her or them . This is , of course , a trick of Trocero 's . My spies tell me there is indisputable evidence that the Poitanians are gathering to invade Aquilonia . I believep173that Trocero will bring forward some pretender who he will claim is King Conan . " Tarascus laughed , but there was no conviction in his laughter . He surreptitiously felt a scar beneath his jupon , and remembered ravens that cawed on the trail of a fugitive ; remembered the body of his squire , Arideus , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great gray wolf , his terrified soldierssaid . But he also remembered a red jewel stolen from a golden chest while a wizard slept , and he said nothing . And Valerius remembered a dying nobleman who gasped out a tale of fear , and he remembered four Khitans who disappeared into the mazes of the south and never returned . But he held his tongue , for hatred and suspicions of his allies ate at him like a worm , and he desired nothing so much as to see both rebels and Nemedians go down locked in the death grip . But Amalric exclaimed , " It is absurd to dream that Conan lives ! " For answer Xaltotun cast a roll of parchment on the table . Amalric caught it up , glared at it . From his lips burst a furious , incoherent cry . He read : To Xaltotun , grand fakir of Nemedia : Dog of Acheron , I am returning to my kingdom , and I mean to hang your hide on a bramble . CONAN . " A forgery ! " exclaimed Amalric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have compared it with the signature on the royal documents in the libraries of the court . None could imitate that bold scrawl . " " Then if Conan lives , " muttered Amalric , " this uprising will not be like the others , for he is the only man living who can unite the Aquilonians . But , " he protested , " this is not like Conan . Why should he put us on guard with his boasting ? One would think that he would strike without warning , after the fashion of the bar-barians . " " We are already warned , " pointed out Xaltotun . " Our spies have told us of preparations for war in Poitain . He could not cross the mountains without our knowledge ; so he sends his defiance in characteristic manner . "  | " Why to you ? " demanded Valerius . " Why not to me , or to Tarascus ? " Xaltotun turned his inscrutable gaze upon the king . " Conan is wiser than you , " he said at last . " He already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not Tarascus , nor Valerius , no , nor Amalric , but Xaltotun who is the real master of the western nations . " They did not reply ; they sat staring at him , assailed by a numbingrealization of the truth of his assertion . " There is no road for me but the imperial highway , " said Xaltotun . But first we must crush Conan . I do not know how he escapedme at Belverus , for knowledge of what happened while I lay in the slumber of the black lotus is denied me . But he is in the south , gathering an army . It is his last , desperate blow , made possibleonly by the desperation of the people who have suffered under Valerius . Let them rise ; I hold them all in the palm of my hand . We will wait until he moves against us , and then we will crush him once and for all . " Then we shall crush Poitain and Gunderland and the stupid Bossonians . After them Ophir , Argos , Zingara , Koth  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast empire . You shall rule as my satraps , and as my captains shall be greater than kings are now . I am unconquerable , for the Heart of Ahriman is hidden where no man can ever wield it against me again . " Tarascus averted his gaze , lest Xaltotun read his thoughts . He knew the wizard had not looked into the golden chest with its carven serpents that had seemed to sleep , since he laid the Heart therein . Strange as it seemed , Xaltotun did not know that the Heart had been stolen ; the strange jewel was beyond or outside the ring of his dark wisdom ; his uncanny talents did not warn him that the chest was empty . Tarascus did not believe that Xaltotun knew the full extent of Orastes ' revelations , for the Pythonian had not mentioned the restoration of Acheron , but only the building of a new , earthly empire . Tarascus did not believe that Xaltotun was yet quite sure of his power ; if they needed his aid in their ambitions , no less he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on sword strokes and lance thrusts . The king read meaning in Amalric 's furtive glance ; let the wizard use his arts to help them defeat their most dangerous enemy . Time enough then to turn against him . There might yet be a way to cheat this dark power they had raised.  |p175CONFIRMATION  OF THE war came when the army of Poitain , ten thousand strong , marched through the southern passes with wavingbanners and shimmer of steel . And at their head , the spies swore , rode a giant figure in black armor , with the royal lion of Aquilonia worked in gold upon the breast of his rich silken surcoat . Conan lived ! The king lived ! There was no doubt of it in men 's minds now , whether friend or foe . With the news of the invasion from the south there also came word , brought by hard-riding couriers , that a host of Gundermen was moving southward , reinforced by the barons of the northwest and the northern Bossonians . Tarascus marched with thirty-one thousand men to Galparan , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the towns still held by the Nemedians . The Shirki was a swift , turbulent river rushing southwestward through rocky gorges and canyons , and there were few places where an army could cross at that time of the year , when the stream was almost bank-full with the melting of the snows . All the country east of the Shirki was in the hands of the Nemedians , and it was logical to assume that the Gundermen would attempt to cross either at Galparan , or at Tanasul , which lay to the south of Galparan . Reinforcements were daily expected from Nemedia , until word came that the king of Ophir was making hostile demonstrationson Nemedia 's southern border , and to spare any more troops would be to expose Nemedia to the risk of an invasion from the south . Amalric and Valerius moved out from Tarantia with twenty-five thousand men , leaving as large a garrison as they dared to discouragerevolts in the cities during their absence . They wished to meet and crush Conan before he could be joined by the rebellious forces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , but there had been no actual clash of arms , no attack on towns or fortresses . Conan had appeared and disappeared . Apparently he had turned westward through the wild , thinly settled hill country , and entered the Bossonian marches , gathering recruits as he went . Amalric and Valerius with their host , Nemedians , Aquilonian renegades , and ferocious mercenaries , moved through the land in baffled wrath , looking for a foe which did not appear.  |p176Amalric  found it impossible to obtain more than vague general tidings about Conan 's movements . Scouting ; parties had a way of riding out and never returning , and it was not uncommon to find a spy crucified to an oak . The countryside was up and striking as peasants and country-folk strike  --  savagely , murderously and secretly . All that Amalric knew certainly was that a large force of Gundermen and northern Bossonians was somewhere to the north of him , beyond the Shirki , and that Conan with a smaller force of Poitanians and southern Bossonians was somewhere to the southwestof him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fartherinto the wild country , Conan might elude them entirely , march around them and invade the central provinces behind them . Amalric fell back from the Shirki valley and camped in a plain a day 's ride from Tanasul . There he waited . Tarascus maintained his position at Galparan , for he feared that Conan 's maneuvers were intended to draw him southward , and so let the Gundermen into the kingdom at the northern crossing . To Amalric 's camp came Xaltotun in his chariot drawn by the uncanny horses that never tired , and he entered Amalric 's tent where the baron conferred with Valerius over a map spread on an ivory camp table . This map Xaltotun crumpled and flung aside . " What your scouts can not learn for you , " quoth he , " my spies tell me , though their information is strangely blurred and imperfect , as if unseen forces were working against me . " Conan is advancing the Shirki river with ten thousand Poitanians , three thousand southern Bossonians , and barons of the west and south with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty thousand Gundermen and northern Bossonians is pushing southward to join him . They have established contact by means of secret communications used by the cursed priests of Asura , who seem to be opposing me , and whom I will feed to a serpent when the battle is over  --  I swear it by Set ! " Both armies are headed for the crossing at Tanasul , but I do not believe that the Gundermen will cross the river . I believe that Conan will cross , instead , and join them . " " Why should Conan cross the river ? " " Because it is to his advantage to delay the battle . The longerp177he waits , the stronger he will become , the more precarious our position . The hills on the other side of the river swarm with people passionately loyal to his cause  --  broken men , refugees , fugitives from Valerius 's cruelty . From all over the kingdom men are hurryingto join his army , singly and by companies . Daily , parties from our armies are ambushed and cut to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will soon burst into open rebellion . The garrisons we left there are not sufficient , and we can hope for no reinforcements from Nemedia for the time being . I see the hand of Pallantides in this brawling on the Ophirean frontier . He has kin in Ophir . " If we do not catch and crush Conan quickly the provinces will be in blaze of revolt behind us . We shall have to fall back to Tarantia to defend what we have taken ; and we may have to fight our way through a country in rebellion , with Conan 's whole force at our heels , and then stand siege in the city itself , with enemies within as well as without . No , we can not wait . We must crush Conan before his army grows too great , before the central provincesrise . With his head hanging above the gate at Tarantia you will see how quickly the rebellion will fall apart . " " Why do you not put a spell on his army to slay them all ? " asked Valerius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he read the full extent of the mocking madness that lurked in those wayward eyes . " Do not worry , " he said at last . " My arts shall crush Conan finally like a lizard under the heel . But even sorcery is aided by pikes and swords . " " If he crosses the river and takes up his position in the Goralian hills he may be hard to dislodge , " said Amalric . " But if we catch him in the valley on this side of the river we can wipe him out . How far is Conan from Tanasul ? " " At the rate he is marching he should reach the crossing sometimetomorrow night . His men are rugged and he is pushing them hard . He should arrive there at least a day before the Gunder-men . " " Good ! " Amalric smote the table with his clenched fist . " I can reach Tanasul before he can . I 'll send a rider to Tarascus , bidding him follow me to Tanasul . By the time he arrives I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then our combinedforce can cross the river and deal with the Gundermen. "
