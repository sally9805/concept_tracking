U.S. Senators faced a dilemma last week : not a landmark decision on war or peace , but a last-minute decision on whether or not to vote themselves a salary increase . Simply by not acting by week 's end , members of Congress would have automatically assured themselves a raise approved by President Nixon , from $42,500 to $45,700 immediately and to $52,800 by 1976 . The pay package would also have given increases to Cabinet members , federal judges and about 5,000 federal officials . Considering that inflation has eaten up nearly 30% of the last increase that Congressmen allowed themselves five years ago , the raises seemed modest and justified . <P> But fearing complaints from disgruntled , inflation-weary voters , the legislators pondered long and hard . They were particularly worried about opinion polls showing that the public holds Congress in particularly low esteem , largely because Watergate has tarnished the image of almost all politicians . In the end , caution prevailed , and the Senate voted 71 to 26 against the pay increase .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
