n October 2 , Ruiz et al . v. Estelle , a broad-based prisoners ' rights suit challenging the administration of the Texas Department of tom , Corrections ( TDC ) , began its public phase in Houston before federal Judge William Wayne Justice . The trial is expected to last at least four months , and possibly much longer . Ruiz is the most important prison case since federal Judge J. Smith Henley declared the Arkansas prison system unconstitutional in Holt v. Sarver in 1970 . At issue in Holt was whether or not the federal government would take over a prison that everyone agreed was an abomination . Arkansas said conditions at Cummins and Tucker were none of the federal government 's business ; , Judge Henley disagreed , and for the first time a state prison system went under federal jurisdiction . His order effectively ended the brutality and squalor that- had for so many years characterized convict life in Arkansas . At issue in Ruiz is whether or not the federal government can take control of a prison system that many correctional experts think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts are convinced that JUdge Justice 's decision will pave the way for federal Control ; some prison officials fear exactly the same thing ; particularly after this month 's prison riot and strike , in ' which fifty people were injured . ' The case results from a seven-year-old group of ' separate lawsuits which Judge Justice combined in ' 1974 ' .4 At that time , he asked the Justice Department to investigate the charges ; he then allowed the department formally to join the plantiffs . The charges are that TDC has insufficient guards to keep inmates , safe , that the prisons are overcrowded , medical care and food are inadequate , work conditions are unsafe , prison officials read mail to and from lawyers and government officials , and that convict guards ? ' , building tenders " ? act as thugs for the prison administrators . ra Prison officials freely admit the overcrowding , but say they 're caught by forces over which they have no control . Texas is a law-and-order state in which few convicted felons are put on probation and few prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the state 's larger cities , to Houston , particularly , has produced a great deal of crime and , lot mf : convictions .

He began doing research in rea  --  as prisons in 1964. crept up to 17,000 and prison planners designed new construction to cope with what they were sure would be a gradual increase in the inmate population . But the social changes caught " them by surprise : the prison population is now almost 25,000 , up almost 50% in four years . Critics say the TDC officials should have known what was coming , but the officials were not the ' OnlY ' Ones caught by surprise ; no sociologist or journalist predicted the population increase . One-man cells have been converted to two-man cells , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattresses on cell floors . Conditions are not likely to improve in the-near future . One Houston judge told me that , though he now uses alternatives to prison far more often than he ever did before , " It does n't make any difference . There are so many of them now , I wind up sending more to Huntsville anyway . " Local critics complain that TDC focuses on security and wo n't put enough convicts in minimum- - security or work-release institutions in cities like Dallas or Houston or San Antonio . But few cities in Texas would tolerate such institutions , and TDC Director W.J. Estelle , Jr . is sensitive to public attitudes . The only kind of population control open to the TDC administrators has to do with good time , and Texas is currently more liberal with good time than almost any other state . Even without parole , a man who avoids trouble can work , off a ten-year sentence in six years , and many do . But that 's not enough to ease the ' density . TDC officials angrily contest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a lot of inmates complain of getting a bum rap , and it is odd to hear wardens and guards talking exactly the same way . They point to_the conditions in other states : California officials now openly negotiate policy with convict gangs ; a New York convict with money ' need never go without heroin for very long ; an Illinois warden resigned recently because half his employees were afraid to . go into the buildings and half his convicts were afraid to come out of their cells . TDC officials point out that Texas has the safest of any of the large prison systems . A staff member or person from outside can walk almost anywhere without fear . From 1973 to 1976 , sixty-six inmates were killed by other inmates . in California , thirty in Florida , twenty-six in Washington , twenty-three in Missouri . Texas , with a prison population greater than California 's and greater than those other three states combined , had only four convict deaths . he issues of medical care and food preparation will be decided on the basis of expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have each hired outside professionals . When I said to one group of inmates that the food seemed to me reasonable country Texas cafeteria style , one said , " That 's because whenever a visitor comes in they change the menu to impress you . " " For all visitors ? " " That 's right , " the inmate said . " That 's a bunch of crap , " a kitchen supervisor said . " The menus- are made up long in advance and anybody can check that . What they mind is n't the food but that it 's prison food . If I was a convict , I wuldn ' , t like anything about prison o either , " ' - , The most bitterly fought issue in the case will probably be over the use of inmates as building tenders . Inmates say ithey , g , et special privileges , sell food , pimp , beat up , w4ce , Afinmates who wo n't play their , games or submitrIto Jthpir hustles , and act as strong-arm men for the officials . Prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , years ago , " one warden said , " I catch one of these building tenders beating up on , ? 9inebody and he goes into isolation like anybody else , " Another warden said , " They might help an officer when he was having trouble with somebody who was getting violent . You do n't know , but there 's a lot of violent people in here . And it 's a law in Texas that a citizen is supposed to help an officer in trouble . I.do n't see anything wrong with that . " Another Varderi ' said , " If I could have four officers on every one of those tiers I would n't use building tenders for anything but mopping the floor . But I do n't have that many officers . And these guys give me information . Sometimes they 're onto something before we can get qhere and they stop somebody from hurtinesoMe'body else . " j udge Justice , who previously ordered integration in Texas public schools , sweeping changes in the administrationiof Texas state hospitals for , the criminallyiinsane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youth Council , does% not believe in simple injunctions . His orders are detailed , covering every aspect of the operation under scrutiny . TDC officials worry that his orders will shatter what they think is the most finely tuned prison , ? administration in the country . ) 1 ' - ' . : : , .. , " We admit to the- overcrowding , but we think we 've coped with it very well- so far , " one official said . " And we can argue some of the other charges . It 's hard , but we can . offer evidence and they can offer evidence and someone can look at both and make a reasonable decision . If he wants to . Some of those issues will be ' more cut and dried than they look now . But others  --  like the building tenders  --  we 're in the position of having to prove that something did n't go on . How do you prove something did n't happen ? " " Do n't they have to Prove the events did occur ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got statements saying we did some things and we 've got statements saying we'did n't : Our statements are no more proof than their statements are prOof , so it comes down to how Justice feels about us , and from what I 've seen , he doeS n't feel very good about us at all . And in the meantime all these charges and statements go in the ' newspapers and we look like a bunch of monsters . We 're not a buncfrof monsters . " The trial was originally scheduled , ? for Justice 's court in Tyler , in the northeastern - part of the state , but when the Justice Department artubunced that it planned to oall as - many ? as 200 inmate witnesses , TDC lawyers asked for a change of venue . There was no room to house the witnesses in Tyler 's little jail , they said , so having the trial there meant inmates and guards would have to spend up ? to six hours a day riding buses to and from the courtroom . Their complaint was legitimate , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern District a more conservative judge , based in Houston , would be assigned to the case , TDC hoped the trial would be shifted to Huntsville , the home base of the sprawling prison system , 75 miles north of HoUston . The moot courtroom at Huntsville 's Sam Houston State University 's Criminal Justice Center is one of the best court facilities in the state . Holding the trial there would mean that security problems would be minimized , TDC records would be easily accessible to either side , and the students in the criminal justice program could watch the proceedings . But the Sam Houston moot courtroom has a sour taste for Texas liberals : it was the site of the trial of three Texas policemen who last year beat and then drowned Joe Campos Torres ; the policemen escaped the murder charges in a trial even Texas conservatives think was a scandal . Though there is no jury in Ruiz , Judge Justice was n't willing to let TDC fight on its home ground . The trial was moved to Houston , and Justice announced that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not made TDC 's defense an easy matter . Rules of disclosure force the government to let Texas know what would be introduced at the trial ( TDC has let federal agents copy everything in its files that interested them ) , but so far the prosecutors have refused to say which inmates would be testifying about which charges . That means TDC can not prepare for specific testimony . Ed Idar , Jr. , the special assistant attorney general handling TDC 's case , asked Judge Justice to force the government agents to comply with the disclosure rules , but Justice declined . The government has also interfered on some occasions with TDC 's witnesses . Norman Carlson , currently director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons , had agreed to testify for TDC , but after his name appeared on a witness list the Justice Department ordered Carlson to stay home . The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice badly needs a victory in this case . It has been responsible for none of the other major prison suits ; it has won no case against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Torres case . A big Texas win would do much for CRD 's image . But why now , why this particular case ? Why should dozens of FBI agents , . a half-dozen federal prosecutors and a large support staff spend so much time and money on this particular prosecution ? In part , because Judge Justice invited them inb When a strong activist judge invites a prosecutor to join a civil suit , that 's a good indication that the judge already has in mind the direction the case will eventually take . In the Texas Youth Council case , much of the prosecution 's design was shaped by Judge Justice . There is another , perhaps more important , reason for the enormous Justice Department investment in Ruiz . Last June , the Department of Justice published a new Set of correctional standards . These standards currently have no legal meaning ; they are merely recommendations and no prison in the country now meets the standards . They differ in several important regards , from another new set of standards issued last year by the American Correctional Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious defects . Incorporation of those Justice Department standards in the TDC ruling would give them an immediate validation available in no other way . It would not be necessary to submit them to public scrutiny or legislative ratification ; it could all be accomplished by a stroke of Wayne Justice 's pen . " As a prison system , TDC probably r s the best around , " a New York prisoners ' rights lawyer said to me . " The government is n't arguing that . There 's no dope in there , there 's hardly ever any violence , and there 's no corruption at all . You ca n't even fault them on rehabilitation because nobody 's claiming they do rehabilitation any more . That 's not what Ruiz is about . It 's this : if they can get Texas , then all the others are dominoes . They can go into every other state and take over those prisons without a trial . We can say hello and they 'll sign a consent decree . New York , California , everybody . " ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
