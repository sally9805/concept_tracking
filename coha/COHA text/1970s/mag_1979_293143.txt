THE MAIN EVENT <P> Directed by Howard Zieff <P> Screenplay by Gail Parent and Andrew Smith <P> Barbra Streisand may be the only female star in films with the box-office power to do almost anything she wants . That being so , it passeth all understanding why she would want to star in and produce ( with her housemate , the distinguished hair stylist Jon Peters ) anything as misbegotten as The Main Event . <P> It is a throwback to the fighting love stories Hollywood used to do in the 1930s : hero and heroine take an instant dislike to each other , then find grounds for affection in the course of squabbling their way through the picture . In this case the premise involves a successful perfume manufacturer ( this ties in with Streisand 's famous proboscis-get it ? ) whose accountant has absconded with all her assets except an inactive prizefighter ( Ryan O'Neal ) . The boxer had been kept on the payroll as a tax loss , which suited him just fine since boxing was the sort of sport at which he imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his owner insists that he must pursue his pugilistic career in earnest . This leads to much yelling between them and much misunderstanding of the rules and traditions of boxing once she takes a hand in his training . The feuding is supposed to be funny , but the film is so repetitive that it is usually boring , when it is n't uncomfortable . <P> The fighter finally gets a big match mostly because he and his owner are so cute and publicizable when they scream at each other in the ring . This leads to the movie 's nadir , a training camp sequence in which we are asked to believe that a competent , liberated woman of our time would passively accept living quarters in an open dormitory populated entirely by the fighter 's all-male staff . Streisand is , if anything , less attractive when she goes all cute and kittenish than when she is being strident and pushy . <P> Were she not an unquestioned star , one would suspect The Main Event of being a vanity production-the sort of thing aging screen queens sometimes get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera may once again be permitted to adore them . In particular , this star seems to labor under the delusion that it is not so much her face as her bottom that is her fortune-so many low angles of it upturned and bouncing about are featured . It 's not a bad bottom , but you ca n't really make a movie of it . You can make a good movie that allows Streisand to employ fully her unquestioned gifts as singer and comedienne . But first , she 's got to stop mooning around .
