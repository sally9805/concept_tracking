Four years ago , Washington Correspondent Hays Gorey , who wrote most of this week 's major report on significant local elections , was covering the Republican National Committee and C.R.P. ( the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ) . John Dean , recently remarried , was staying silently behind the scenes at the White House as counsel to Richard Nixon . Watergate was still best known as an expensive apartment-office complex on the Potomac River . <P> This election year , John Dean , who helped make Watergate part of American speech and history , is a journalist himself , having revealed in a Rolling Stone article the scatological indiscretion that forced Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz to resign . Gorey , who had yet to cultivate Dean as a news source in 1972 , has since come to know him and his second wife better . He interviewed Dean extensively from the time of his firing by Nixon in April 1973 to his release from prison in January 1975 and collaborated with Mrs. Dean on a book , " Mo " : A Woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric to restore the faith of the people in our political system , " says Gorey . " But I think something like Watergate may never happen again . It forced those who gain public office to examine what they do . " <P> Gorey has reported on Capitol Hill , presidential candidates and the Justice , Labor and Treasury departments since coming to TIME 's Washington bureau from the Salt Lake City Tribune eleven years ago . <P> For the 1976 campaign , he has switched roles and helped to interpret the rush of each week 's events as a writer in New York for the NATION section . In his spare time , he is writing a volume about the political growth of Robert Kennedy , whom he covered in the Senate and during R.F.K. 's brief , tragic 1968 presidential campaign . <P> Also contributing to this week 's local election survey were New York Bureau Chief Laurence Barrett , who reported and wrote the articles on the lively New York and Pennsylvania Senate races , and Nation Writer Stephen Schlesinger , who focused on some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that most of these races have a common theme . " Watergate has definitely affected the elections this year , " he says . " Almost everyone has made integrity in government an issue . " <P> Barrett covered the Gold water and Johnson camps in 1964 but reports that he has a special affection for a state-level contest . " You see both the candidates and the citizenry in something approaching a natural state , " says Barrett . " You hear the voters ' concerns and you find out whether a politician talks to ordinary folks , or simply processes them through the handshaking-and-grin machine . "
