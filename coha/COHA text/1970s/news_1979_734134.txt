txt Menachem Begin , the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Cairo , arrived today to a polite but subdued reception . Minutes before his plane landed , Israeli flags were run up at the Cairo airport . As the airliner taxied to the red carpet flapping on the tarmac at 11:30 A.M. , Vice President Hosni Mubarak , Mrs. Mubarak and two Egyptian protocol officials waited to greet him . After brief formalities , Mr. Begin was ushered to a black limousine and whisked , amid tight security , to Tahra Palace , which is used for visiting dignitaries who are'not heads of state . The Israeli flags were lowered as he left . Policemen in black uniforms far outnumbered the occasional spectators on the streets along which the limousine sped . There were no banners , no portraits and none of the enthusiasm with which President Anwar el-Sadat was greeted in Jerusalem during his visit in November 1977 . President Sadat did not meet Mr. Begin Until evening , when the Egyptian leader gave a dinner in the Prime Minister 's honor in the lamplit garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ranking Just under Mr. Sadat in protocol , was the proper person to receive Mr. Begin at the airport . Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil , who headed the Egyptian delegation in the final stages of the peace treaty negotiations , was absent from the airport cere- mony . He said he had not felt well . The only diplomats present were the Norwe : gian ambassador and the United States charg ? d'af fairs . There was some speculation that the visit was being played down to avoid further angering Arab countries that voted economic and political sanctions against Egypt at a meeting in Baghdad , Iraq . Mr. Begin 's tough bargaining stand in negotiations also apparently played a part . Mr. Begin preferred to describe his reception as " very friendly . " At the state dinner , he toasted Mr. Sadat with a " hallelujah " for peace , and said he believed that " in God 's good time " the Arab nations opposing the treaty would join in a comprehensive Middle East settlement . The Prime Minister and President Sadat are scheduled to hold talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Missing Although Israeli officials stressed that Mr. Begin had come at Mr. Sadat 's invitation and had not solicited the invitation , the visit lacked the drama of Mr. Sadat 's visit to Jerusalem or the Israeli Prime Minister 's visit the following month to the Suez Canal city of Ismailia . It was also less lavish that the welcome given President Carter last month or , for that matter , the reception that the Shah of Iran received when he stopped in Aswan on his way into exile in January . Mr.Begin 's visit , Including a tour during the day of the pyramids , was broadcast for Egyptian viewers over Cairo television . Sahar Ismail , a 13-year-old who was walking to school near Tahra Palace with several friends , said : " I. welcome Begin only because he agreed with Sadat on a peace treaty . However , I 'd have preferred that he come after we get Sinai back . Then everyone would welcome Begin 's efforts . " A schoolmate , Mahe Omar , 15 , said , " When Carter came , every Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to cheer him . Carter is much closer to our hearts than Begin is . " Several Egyptians lounging about Tahra Square in the traditional peasant galabiyas , ankle-length robes , explained that they could not comment to the press because they were plainclothes security agents on duty . One of the few Egyptians allowed into the square was Zahran Agami , a street cleaner . " I 've swept this area hundreds of times for guests of Tahra but I can not do my job right today . I distrust this man , " Mr. Agami said . This afternoon , outside a synagogue that Mr. Begin visited on Adly Street in central Cairo , a crowd of Egyptians applauded when he emerged . They shouted " Shalom ! " and " Salaam ! " the Hebrew and Arabic words for peace . " Yes , I like him and I came to welcome him , " said Mahmoud Fahmy , a clerk at a nearby bank . " Is n't he here for peace ? Is n't he going to give us back our land ? Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we welcome him ? "
