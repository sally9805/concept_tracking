Indy 's Gasoline Alley , the row of machine shops that line the famed old oval , roared last week with the sound of 900-h.p. engines being pushed to their limit and bustled with mechanized frenzy , profanity and machismo as next Sunday 's 500-mile race drew nearer . The Alley is the ultimate in that American male sanctuary , the local garage . TIME 's Barrett Seaman reports how a woman was faring there last week : <P> The instant she saw the faces of the four veteran United States Auto Club drivers who had judged her in the U.S.A.C. 20-lap " rookie test " last Monday afternoon , Janet Guthrie feared the worst . Solemn , with eyes that avoided hers , Gary Bettenhausen , Al Loquasto Jr. , Tom Bigelow and Graham McCrae offered their critiques : " shaky , " " afraid to go to the wall , " " frightened . " Then Bettenhausen could contain himself no longer and began to laugh . <P> " You s.o.b.s ! " blurted Guthrie , 38 , the first female to break into the super-macho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed the Indianapolis 500 's rookie test with honors . " The smoothest rookie I 've ever seen , " proclaimed Bigelow . Added Loquasto : " Definitely a heads-up driver . " <P> This interim triumph in the face of agonizing pressure was one of precious few highlights in Janet Guthrie 's two-week introduction to Indy . From the first day , when American Airlines lost her luggage-driver 's suit , crash helmet and all-it had been an uphill battle . <P> Endlessly the butt of off-color jokes , harassed constantly by reporters , both legitimate and bogus , and jeered by frequently unsympathetic crowds at every stall or slip , Guthrie had persevered . So thick were the throngs outside her garage in Gasoline Alley that race cars were unable to get through to the track . Accused of entering just as a publicity stunt , mislabeled caustically as a women 's libber and once even asked outright if she was a lesbian , Guthrie calmly disclaimed all , except to say : " I 'm a driver , period . " <P> Impressive Wins . Her problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best woman race driver , Italy 's Leila Lombardi , 33 , who competes on the Grand Prix circuit , recalled last week that " only in the United States have I recently encountered real prejudice . Why do American men say , ' No , you 're out of it because you 're a woman . ' So many American race drivers behave like male chauvinists instead of men who practice a sport . " <P> The daughter of an Eastern Air Lines pilot , Guthrie grew up in Miami , Fla. , in a world of combustion engines , went on to log over 400 hours as a pilot herself , and has been driving fast cars since 1963 . Single , a resident of New York City and a physicist , she was one of four women considered for astronaut status by NASA in 1965 . She has competed in more than 120 recognized auto races ; her most impressive wins were in the " Under 2 Liter Prototype " class at Sebring , Fla. , in 1970 and in the " B Sedan " class in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
