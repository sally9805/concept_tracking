For 37 minutes on Saturday morning , it might have seemed that General Jack D. Ripper , the manic guardian of " precious bodily fluids " from Dr. Strangelove , was at the controls . From the Army 's civil defense warning center in Colorado 's Cheyenne Mountain , a signal was flashed directly onto the wires of the Associated Press and United Press International . It was a notification that the nation was in a state of emergency , confirmed by an appropriately sinister code " authenticator " - HATEFULNESS , HATEFULNESS . Scores of radio and television stations across the nation broadcast the emergency . <P> It turned out that the warning center , which regularly transmits a taped test message to the news-service wires , had inadvertently sent an actual warning tape . To unstick the panic button and resolve the confusion , the center finally got through the prearranged code signal canceling the alert . Quite unintentionally , it sounded a sardonically witty note : CANCEL MESSAGE SENT AT 09:33 EST . MESSAGE AUTHENTICATOR : IMPISH , IMPISH.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
