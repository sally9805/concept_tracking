SMOOTH , well-connected , brainy , successful in all that they had done , they reached enviable positions of power in American political life . By dint of hard work , some luck and fierce loyalty to Richard Nixon , they had earned the President 's trust . Yet last week they were a forlorn group , implicated in willfully or naively subverting the political process . The men involved in the Watergate scandal include several who are household names and others who may soon yearn for the obscurity that they once had . Among them : <P> JOHN MITCHELL , 59 , former director of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( C.R.P. ) and a onetime law partner of Richard Nixon 's in the Manhattan firm of Nixon Mudge Rose Guthrie and Mitchell . A dour , pipe-puffing municipal-bond lawyer , Mitchell was also Nixon 's closest political confidant . As Attorney General from 1969 until early 1972 , he was the exemplar of the tough law-and-order man , who claimed the authority to tap the telephone of anyone whom he considered a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 , to direct Nixon 's re-election campaign . His tenure at C.R.P. was brief . In a well-publicized yet ultimately unconvincing marital spat shortly after the Watergate breakin , Mitchell 's loquacious wife Martha threatened to leave him unless he got out of what she called the " dirty " business of politics . Mitchell left C.R.P. but remained close to the President . <P> JEB STUART MAGRUDER , 38 , formerly deputy campaign director of C.R.P. A Californian who looks as if he could pose for old Arrow-shirt ads , Magruder was president of a small cosmetics firm before he entered politics . He was coordinator of Nixon 's 1968 campaign in Los Angeles , went to Washington in 1969 as a special assistant to the President . He was a favorite of White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman . <P> Magruder joined C.R.P. early last year and hoped for a political career , aiming to run for Secretary of State of California next year and Governor or U.S. Senator in 1978 . But he was forced to abandon his plans after his involvement in political espionage came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a high Administration post after the election , but Haldeman told him that he would not be in line for a top position ( which would require Senate confirmation ) because he was too tainted by Watergate . Disappointed , he settled for a specially created but vague job as director of planning and evaluation at the Commerce Department . <P> JOHN WESLEY DEAN III , 34 , Counsel to the President and the man who conducted the investigation of the Watergate case that cleared all White House staffers . A lawyer who has hardly practiced privately , clean-cut Dean worked as minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee . He gained such a reputation as a Nixon loyalist that in 1969 he was hired by the Justice Department as its legislative liaison man . Highly recommended by almost every Administration official with whom he came into contact , Dean caught the eye of image-oriented people at the White House , and in 1970 moved over there to succeed John Ehrlichman as counsel . He has outlined the legal basis for Nixon 's decisions to impound funds voted by Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
