Whether genuinely baffled , simply supercautious or just plain ornery , U.S. primary voters continue to dangle the presidential nominations tantalizingly beyond the reach of all contenders . A victor 's smile and glowing predictions seem only to ensure a comeuppance seven days later . As the primary trail nears an apparently inconclusive end , a clutch of uncommitted delegates to both Democratic and Republican Conventions has been dealt a hot-and potentially decisive-hand . They may well determine the 1976 nominees . <P> Although many of the powerful uncommitted are political bosses and officeholders , a substantial number are mainly middle-class Americans with long records of hard-slogging service to their parties-ringing doorbells , running Xerox machines , driving voters to the polls on election days . They include an air-pollution technician from Virginia , a haberdasher from Kansas , a housewife from Oklahoma and a community antipoverty organizer from New York . Some Governors , big-city mayors and state chairmen head uncommitted groups , but their persuasive powers may be lost on the individual delegates ; many intend to vote their own consciences . <P> As of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those totals will grow in the final six primaries , and as fourteen states that choose delegates in caucuses complete that process . There will be some whittling away too as some uncommitted jump to a candidate . <P> Barring yet another surprise , President Ford and Ronald Reagan , each of whom won three primaries last week , will emerge from the delegate selection process just short of the 1,130 delegates required for the Republican nomination . Democrat Jimmy Carter is expected to be several hundred delegates short of the 1,505 needed to snare the prize . <P> If these figures hold , 100 to 150 uncommitted Republican delegates will have the power to do what 6 million G.O.P. primary voters apparently could not : choose between Ford and Reagan . From 200 to 300 Democratic uncommitted may open the door to Carter-or bring on a brokered convention that could outweigh eleven million votes cast in Democratic primaries . <P> The situations in both parties : <P> REPUBLICANS . Currently 67 Republican uncommitted are thought to be leaning to Reagan , 34 to Ford . The remaining 100 Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to choose ideologically between the two : both suit their conservative instincts just fine . Surprisingly few are holding out in hope of a job or other favor . A number miss in Ford the image of a decisive leader that they perceive in Reagan , and yet they are reluctant to discard an incumbent who they believe has performed passably well in difficult circumstances .
