One favorite Washington joke says that . a definition of an optimist is a woman who puts her shoes on when Hubert Humphrey says , " In conclusion ... " Today , people remembered that Senator Humphrey cared about men and women , not just humanity . J.B. Cardaro , one of his staff members , recalled that he was once hesitant to push an issue , fearing that he was overloading the Senator . " He said to me , took , we 're only doine about half of what we should be doing , Mr. Cardaro recalled . " He made you realize that there was no limit to what you could do . " Then there was his sense of humor , rare in such a public politician . Mr. Cardaro remembers walking across the Capitol one day with Mr. Humphrey and Senator Edward M.

A young woman who was there that day recalled today that Mr. Humphrey smiled and said , " Shush , do n't tell the President . " Perhaps the quality his friends remember most was his endless good cheer . Mrs. Humphrey told friends today that , right up until the end , Mr. Humphrey was hoping to return to Washington . He still had things to do ? strengthen his full employment bill , help the Arab-Israeli peace talks , revise the foreign aid program . Even last week , when his voice was cracking and weak , he said he was feeling better , " Mr. Muskie said . " I thought he might even lick this thing yet .
