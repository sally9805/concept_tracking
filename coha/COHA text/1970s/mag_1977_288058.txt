Canines may be the culprits carrying a slow virus <P> Researchers seeking the cause of multiple sclerosis , a disabling disease involving damage to the protective sheathing around nerve fibers , have long suspected that the answer might lie in a delayed reaction to a viral infection contracted years in the past . One suspect has been the measles virus , but 90% or more of all Americans in the prevaccination era got measles , while only a fraction of 1% developed MS . Now three New Jersey physicians have developed preliminary data suggesting that exposure to pet dogs may be related to MS . <P> Drs . Stuart D. Cook and Peter C. Dowling of the neurology service at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange knew that while MS is not a directly inherited disease , it often strikes two and sometimes more members of a single family . They sought out 29 such patients and examined their patterns of pet ownership and exposure . It turned out that the MS families differed from their MS-free neighbors in one relevant respect : a greater proportion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 25 lbs. , or 11.4 kg. ) that stayed indoors much of the time . And the MS patients were found to have been exposed to their pets most intensively during the ten years before the first symptoms of their disease appeared . ( In many cases , diagnosis is so difficult that MS can not be confirmed for many years after these first symptoms . ) <P> Especially striking was one family with four sisters , three of whom continued to live together in their childhood home and developed MS symptoms in 1974 ; the fourth sister , who had left home in 1971 , remains free of any sign of the disease . The three homebodies had had close contact with the family dog , which suffered a severe brain disease in 1973 . In ten other families , the mother and a child had the disease ; in two , the father and a child ; in 16 , siblings were affected . Another coincidence involved a woman and her nephew , who lived together and both developed MS in the same year . <P> One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is most common in northern states and decreases in incidence toward the Gulf states and the tropics . Since dogs are about equally popular in both the North and South of the U.S. , some questioners of the Cook-Dowling research have asked how dogs can have anything to do with the human disease . Bowling 's answer : In the warmer South , dogs are less often kept indoors as house pets , but are left to roam more freely outside than in the cooler North . <P> Cook and Dowling made their first report in the London medical journal the Lancet . Now they have additional data prepared for publication , and another physician , Dr. Seymour Jotkowitz of Hackensack , has described an " impressive incidence of contact with sick dogs " in MS patients . Perhaps it is significant that among the many viruses that dogs harbor , one that causes distemper is a first cousin to that of the long-suspected human measles . Whether household pet dogs can ever be proved guilty of carrying an MS-related virus and what that virus may be are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected so far is not strong enough for pet owners to become alarmed . Even so , MS virology researchers intend to follow up the new scent .
