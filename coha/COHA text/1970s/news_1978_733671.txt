txt Letters A Half-Hour ' Paid Advertisement ' on P.B.S. To the Editor : An advertisement you ran opposite the television page of the June 2 issue raises serious questions about the current state of our experiment in public broadcasting . The advertising in question , paid for by Mobil , invited the reader to watch " In Search of the Real America : Enemies of Growth , " a program which the reader was led to believe would show that " the twentieth century is good for your health , " and that the principal spokesman on the program believes that " some environmentalists are bad news . " Obviously that is a legitimate point of view for Mobil to have . Indeed , Mobil has been spending large amounts of money to bring it before To the Editor : Jones Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches on the East Coast . It boasts clean sand , relatively clean water and a dedicated park staff . However , on recent visits I was affronted by a most objectionable form of pollutions : blaring rock noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) sound systems . So prevalent is this nefarious practice that it is virtually impossible to find a peaceful spot on the ' beach . Requests to turn down the volume are usually met with indifference or worse : a spiteful volume increase . I find this noxious " music " with its primordial rhythm and orgiastic beat impossible to bear . The incessant , repetitious bass boom-boom-boom juxtaposed with shrill high-frequently synthetic wheezes makes one 's skin crawl . Words can not describe the inner rage kindled by this brutal assault on the senses . A move to another spot is to no avail ; soon another group comes by and wants everyone to share in the stertorous odium . A simple solution exists . I propose that the beaches follow the example of the airlines . Just as airplanes have a smoking and non-smoking section , let there be a radio and non-radio region An Architectural Peak To the Editor : I.M.

The marriage of sculpture and architecture has never been more complete . Spaces such as the David Smith gallery may be unsurpassable .

Then again , through its relative stillness , Calder may have been sending a message of his awe WALTER A. RUTES White Plains , June 2 , 1978 the public . And it is also a legitimate perspective for a public broadcasting service to put before the American people . When , however , the two merge ? a- when the public broadcasting service in effect permits Mobil to buy time to put forward a message so close to its corporate heart ? then the notion of a public broadcasting service has been ineradicably stained . Some have complained even that corporations such as Mobil are permitted to show their names before and after entertainment shows which they help to support on public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mobil gains good will in some diffuse way for its support of " Masterpiece Theater " that seems a // Frances letter on the beaches . Just as the clean , smooth sand is rock-free , let part of the air be rock-free too . Sol . WEINTRAUB Flushing , N.Y. , June 4 , 1978 The Believer To the Editor : Lately , amid the overuse of " like " and " ya know , " a new irritation has penetrated speech patterns . When I acquaint someone with a circumstance or impart an opinion , the individual agrees with me by advising , " You better believe it . " I would not have made a predication if I did n't believe it . If somebody wishes to impress me with acceptance of an assertion , all he has to do is to say so simply . This allusion to emphasize enthusiasm of concurrence is indeed most annoying . STANLEY EGELBERG Eastchester , N.Y. , May 30 , 1978 small price to pay . The program is not connected with Mobil 's immediate corporate interest , and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor can I fault Mobil for behaving in what it doubtless perceived as its own , immediate self-interest in underwriting this program , to whatever extent it did so . Here is a message which immediately forwards the corporation 's interests , and so from the perspective of its board of directors , the case for supporting it must have been all the more strong . Even seen in the perspective of a continuing series of programs " In Search of the Real America , " the opportunities for , in effect , proselytizing corporate views are substantial . But it is for just this reason inexcusable that the public broadcasting service did not exercise some self-discipline on the matter , and refuse Mobil 's sponsorship . Surely its officials ought to understand that , however much more advantageous sponsorship of such a program ( or series ) is to Mobil than " Masterpiece Theater , " it is at least that much worse for public broadcasting . Where corporate interests can be directly associated with the editorial content of the program to be presented , public broadcasting ought simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to be conveyed . For what we have here is not half a minute of silent advertisement of Mobil 's presumed civic virtues , but a half-hour of paid advertisement of its views , delivered straight from the heart . ( Prof. ) PETER STRAUSS Columbia University School of Law New York , June 5 , 1978 Erosion of a Freedom To the Editor : Many lay people are taking great satisfaction from the most recent decision of the Supreme Court which makes it possible for newsrooms to be searched by police who have obtained ? a warrant . These are the folks who decry the " power of the press to ruin people 's lives " or who ca n't understand why their club news does n't make headlines . It might be well for them to reflect on the fact that throughout history when free and open societies have fallen , the first freedom to be abolished has been most often the freedom to publish . Sometimes this freedom has been eroded so slowly that it is gone before it is missed . The Supreme Court decision is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the media . Regrettably , five of the Justices have overlooked the fact that no people have ever been enslaved by the lords of the press or television , but many a police agency has been rapidly turned into an armed force for ooDression and supression . ADELAIDE R. SNYDER Boca Raton , Fla. , June 1,1978 Rock on a Rock-Free Beach City Civil Service : A Veteran Reminisces Working Holiday ro the Editor : The curious affair of the double holiday apparently created confusion not only in the hearts and minds of the general citizenry but of The New York Times Editorial Board as well . Governor Carey 's New York City office did not , as you stated , remain " resolutely closed . " It remained resolutely open ? despite a festival lack of air-conditioning in a building that has windows that ca n't be opened , and non-state employees in charge of air circulation who had the day off . Despite it all , the state employees scheduled to work on Monday made it in and got through the day in tolerably good humor . ERIKA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , June 1 , 1978 To the Editor : I read your comment in a recent Topics column about Joseph Christian , who " started in city government in the 1930 's as an $840-a-year clerk . " You speak flatteringly of him as " one of the last members of the Civil Service generation that started in the Depression , when private job opportunities were limited , " and add that " the city 's current economic slump will have accomplished something if it attracts into public service a new generation of his caliber . " As one of those who came into Civil Service from that list , and I think I remember the name Joseph Christian , I feel a surge of nostalgia welling up in me . I 'm retired now from the Board of Education , but I often recall events associated with that list . For example , you might like to know that Murray Bergtraum , former president of the Board of Education , was first on that list . Of some 16,000 who took the test , the list consisted of over 4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ( male ) , as it was called , was a very exacting one , including questions on vocabulary , mathematics , general information , judgment in handling office problems , etc . It also required the ability to type about 30 words a minute . Most striking was the physical requirement . The candidate had to be able to chin five times , lift 35 pounds in one hand and 25 in the other , jump across a rope three feet high , handwalk a suspended ladder , etc . Our Mayor at that time was La Guardia . It seemed he would be Mayor forever . There was no Civil Service union as such . They were hard times and it was a struggle , but many careers developed with this list as a beginning , in the professions , in the Board of Eduction and elsewhere in government service . JEROME GREENBLATT Armonk , N.Y. , May 27 , 1978 Packwood-Moynihan Bill : An ' Invalid ' Analogy To the Editor : Your " no-fault " editorial May 30 Is misleading as to the true impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Michigan . The New York experience with " no-fault " has been double and triple insurance premiums in the past four years . In Michigan rates almost doubled . The denial of access to the courtroom except to those " seriously " injured , as is contemplated in national " no-fault , " will eliminate 99 percent of those injured from receiving compensation unless totally disabled for a sixmonth period . Your espousal of this system , which denies basic human rights , places greater importance on property rights of the insurance industry . In 1977 the insurance casualty industry reaped a $1.5 billion profit on underwriting and an increase of $6 billion in investment income from our casualty insurance dollars . National " no-fault " and New York " no-fault " are regressive taxes on the driving public , forcing them to purchase accident and health coverage which 85 percent of them already possess by virtue of union contracts or employer-funded programs . " No-fault " only generates more dollars for insurance companies , with higher rates and less coverage for the consumer . Polls in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit Free Press , indicate that the people resoundingly reject the " no-fault " concept . The continued use of outdated and improperly drawn Department of Transportation figures and the continued promise of premium reductions ( which have not occurred with the passage of New York " no-fault " ) will not deceive the voting public . We who must drive a car to earn a living have felt the tightening of the yoke of financial burden around our necks with skyrocketing rates , accompanied by the elimination of basic rights ? all for the insurance Industry 's benefit . Instead of making the trial lawyer a scapegoat , why not focus on the profits made from " nofault " by the insurance industry ? SHERIDAN ALBERT President-Elect , New York State Trial Lawyers Association New York , June 1 , 1978 To the Editor : . The Times is to be commended for granting space to a dialogue on the farreaching Moynihan-Packwood Bill . In Mr. Scanlon 's letter ( May 23 ) , he attempts to analogize the potential . consequences of the bill at the elementary and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attempted parallel is invalid . He argues that public institutions of higher learning have been increasing enrollments at a greater pace than private institutions . At least two basic reasons are readily apparent . First , the cost of tuition and board at private colleges is far greater than the relatively nominal cost at public institutions . Second , even with the disparity in cost , the private institutions ' can not accommodate more than a fraction of applicants.Surely this has no relevance to the potential consequences of Packwood-Moynihan at the elementary and secondary level . Mr. Scanlon points to the fact that public institutions of higher learning are not the resort of only the troubled and handicapped and poor . Institutions of higher learning set their own standards for admission and may expel the disruptive and the deficient . Private elementary and secondary schools have the same privileges . Only the public schools must accept anyone , including those rejected or expelled by non-public schools . Mr. Scanlon obliquely denies that , once the principle of tuition aid at the elementary and secondary level is adopted , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local level to increase the partial reimbursement to full reimbursement . The fact is that voucher plans which would give to parents of private school children the same amount as the ? school district spends on public school children have been supported by the same coalition which now is fighting for adoption of the Moynihan-Packwood Bill . Indeed , in the February issue of Church and State it is reported : " In the fall of 1977 the Michigan Catholic Conference launched a campaign to initiate an amendment to the State Constitution to provide full tax support for parochial and private schools under a voucher plan . " Mr. Scanlon 's final and fundamental thesis is that in order " to make feasible the First Amendment guarantee of free exercise of religion " it is required that the Moynihan-Packwood Bill be passed . If this argument is valid , then it is equally incumbent upon the Government to grant public aid to churches and synagogues which are in financial need in order to " guarantee the free exercise of religion .
