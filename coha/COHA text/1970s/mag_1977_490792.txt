THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IN an interview the other evening with Benjamin Bradlee , the executive editor of the Washington Post , Martin Agronsky , on the public-television program " Agronsky at Large , " remarked that the Post and the New York Times were generally thought to be the two most " powerful " newspapers in the United States , and went on to ask Bradlee whether the Post was " on a peer level " with the Times . Bradlee , forgoing any comment on the premise of Agronsky 's question  --  that the success of newspapers could be measured in terms of power  --  responded as though the question had concerned the excellence of the two publications , and graciously said that , although he liked to think that when the two newspapers were pitted against each other in the reporting of a major story his own would provide the superior coverage , he had to admit that he sometimes looked on a story in the Times with professional envy . At this point in the discussion , we felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we happen to have some strong views on the question of the relationship of journalism to power . In our opinion , power is the last thing that a newspaper should aim for . Certainly it is the last thing that a newspaper is ever likely to attain . News stories can , of course , have large political consequences . Bob Woodward 's and Carl Bernstein 's investigation of the Watergate break-in for the Post , for example , apparently had a good deal to do with President Nixon 's fall from office . But did this mean that Woodward and Bernstein had engaged in the exercise of great power ? To wield power is to exercise discretionary authority over events . It is to determine that ten billion dollars will be spent to create jobs rather than five billion dollars , that B-52s will or will not bomb a foreign country , that one 's political Opposition will or will not be thrown into jail . But Woodward and Bernstein exercised no such discre don , When they set to work on their story , they had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much Less were they in a position to actively seek those consequences . Rather , they had to pursue the trail of the evidence single-mindedly , wherever it might lead . It was not within their power to find that the trail led to anyone other than the chiefs of the Committee for the Re-Election of the President , then to the inner circle of the President 's White House staff , and , finally , to the President himself , and thus choose which powerful politicians would topple . They were not at liberty to discover the facts to be other than what they were . Although they , like most people , were bound to have their likes and dislikes among politicians , they could not let those preferences influence their findings without jeopardizing the value of the findings . In a free country , facts are powerful . But it is not reporters who wield that power . Indeed , when reporters begin to interest themselves in power , and begin to consider themselves the equals of people who really are powerful , like Presidents , senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their effectiveness altogether . To our mind , it is endlessly instructive in the ways of journalism that the Watergate story was broken by two metropolitan-desk reporters , who had no experience in covering national politics , while scores of White House reporters , who were close to the seat of power , were somehow paralyzed . If reporters are powerless , in the strict sense of the term , are editorial writers , then , the powerful ones at newspapers ? It is true that polemical writing can attempt to give the reader a push in one direction or another , and that in that sense an editorialist has a latitude of discretion which a reporter lacks . But if this discretion can be called power at all , it is the very palest sort of power . The editorialist has only the art of persuasion at his disposal , and persuasion is notoriously chancy , for ultimately it is up to the reader whether or not he will lend his sympathy to the argument . The so-called power of the editorialist is therefore a borrowed power . The reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw it as he reads the next , or he may withhold it altogether . The exercise of real power works in an entirely different way : if Congress passes and the President signs a law , it is not up to the citizen whether or not he will obey ; if the President orders a soldier into battle , it is not up to him whether or not he will go . Compared to facts , the opinions of editorialists are probably of small con-sequence . No number of editorials could have led to President Nixon 's resignation from office . Only a fact ? in this case , the one known as " the smoking gun , " which turned out to he President Nixon 's order to H. R. Haldeman , the White House chief of staff , to have the F.B.I . call off its investigation into certain areas of Wa-tergate  --  could have done that . The political weakness of opin-ion as opposed to fact points to a danger that is likely to arise when newspapers begin to regard them-selves as powerful . Politicians know very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fact , and therefore they would often like to persuade the public that all facts are mere opin-ions in disguise . Richard Nixon , for one , unquestionably wanted the public to be-lieve that . He knew that if the facts published in the Washington Post could somehow be misrepresented as expres-sions of someone 's low opinion of him , they could be brushed aside . Nor was it any accident that he and Vice-Presi-dent Agnew ceaselessly warned the public against the " power " of the press . For implicit in the idea that the press was powerful was the idea that the stories in the press were only a re-flection of prevailing opinion in certaro political circles , rather than a reflection of the truth . A corollary of this view was President Nixon 's idea that all Presidents had done what he had done , and that the press , in an unfair , malicious exercise of its power , was singling him out for special attention . He also certainly knew something about the press which newsmen should never forget : that when newspapers come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it easier to use instruments of real power instruments of intimidation , and even of force  --  against them . And in that sort of struggle even the most " powerful " newspaper in the country , whichever one that might he , would quickly discover just how little power it really had . ? ? Dough DURING the Aztec Festival held one recent Saturday at the Center for Inter-American Relations  --  a building , at Park Avenue and Sixty-eighth Street , that usually functions as a gathering place for thinkers and problem solvers who have a special interest in how the Americas ( North , Central , South ) get along together  --  anyone who did n't want to tour the Aztec stone-sculpture exhibition on the ground floor or watch films called " Viva Mexico " and " Pedro Linares : Folk Artist " on the third floor could make what were called dough sculptures in a kitchen on the second floor . In their heyday  --  the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  --  the Aztecs fashioned religious icons out of a mixture of cornmeal and a sacred grain made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion fashion , ate them . ( According to the orthodox Aztecs , an ideal dough sculpture was a facsimile of a god with goggle eyes and fangs or a goddess with a tassled headdress . ) Because of a local amaranth shortage , however , the organizers of the Aztec Festival had to substitute gingerbread for the sacred dough . Perhaps as a consequence , most of the dough sculptors proved to be children . " It 's a kind of dough that will remain intact for years , " said Diana Fane , a graduate student in art history at Columbia , who was supervising the dough-sculpture operation " For any of the children who are interested , I 've drawn a picture of an Aztec goddess holding ears of corn and wearing a headdress that represents a temple . They can copy that in gingerbread if they want to . But the Aztecs created images from their world , and I guess most of the children will create images from theirs . " As Mrs. Fane shuttled trays between the worktable and the oven , we saw gingerbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddesses holding ears of corn and wearing temple-shaped headdresses . A few of the sculptors , though , were making an effort to turn out designs that were reasonably Aztec-inspired . Robert Perlman , a nine-year-old who told us that his class at the Village Community School has been studying Aztec culture recently , shaped a circular piece of dough , topped it with a coiled serpent , and equipped the serpent 's mouth with two sunflower seeds that made a convincing-looking pair of fangs . " This serpent is important because it 's one of the main animals of Mexico , " said Robert . " I 've already seen the sculptures downstairs . The show mainly has a lot of gods and sacrificial vessels . " Nearby , Maren Handler carefully labored over a horse 's head flattened on a piece of waxed paper . Because it was so finely sculptured , she had trouble removing it from the paper without upsetting the details of the horse 's mane . " She decided to make the horse instead of just any design because she 's past the age for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberta Handler . She added that Maren was twelve . " Do n't you like abstract art ? " we asked Maren , but she was apparently too busy to answer . " Oh , no , " said Mrs. Handler . " She 's very fond of reality . " We wandered out of the kitchen and into a large room where two assembly lines  --  one for calendar-stone relief rubbings and the other for gods ' eyes  --  were heavily patronized . The first person we met was THE NEW YORKER Leslie Stone , aged eleven , whose father , Roger , is the president of the Center for Inter-American Relations . " And that 's my mother , " she said , pointing to a woman standing a few feet away . " She usually works at the Museum of Natural History , but today she 's the lady having frustrations with kids who ca n't do gods ' eyes . " Leslie explained that gods ' eyes are made by crossing two sticks perpendicularly and binding them with colored yarn or string . The string is wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are gods ' eyes something that anyone should he able to make ? " we asked . Leslie sighed impatiently and said , " Well , it 's just that they 're very easy . " She then led us to the gods ' - eyes station and , in a couple of minutes , wove colored thread around a pair of toothpicks until she had created the eye of a miniature deity . Whenever she reached the end of a piece of thread , she sealed it in place with a touch of Elmer 's glue . Looking around the table , we noticed that almost as much glue was inadvertently landing in children 's mouths and hair as was being properly applied to the gods ' eyes . This made us wonder how many of the gingerbread sculptures would survive across the years for ornamental purposes and how many would be eaten before dinner . Back in the kitchen , we sought to broach the subject with Dana Halperin , who is three years old and has long light-brown hair . She was busy decorating an odd-shaped piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits of artificially colored dried fruit . " What 's that supposed to he ? " we asked . " A cookie , " said liana . Beautiful White Swan " T WANT you to come downtown with me today , " the old curmud-geon said one Tuesday noon . " I want to enlist you in a cause . " Whereupon we set off for the Downtown Athletic Club , just north of the Battery , on the Hudson , and there reported for duty in the Governors Room , on the thirty-first floor , whose big windows afforded a magnificent view of the ( alas ! ) ship-free New York Harbor . There was a small bar and a table set for what was obviously to he a small and uncrowded luncheon . The old curmudgeon introduced us to , among others , Alfred Van Santvoorcl Olcott , Jr. , of the fifth generation of a family that was deeply invoked with steamhoating on the Hudson River for a matter of a hundred and twenty-three years ; Frank Braynard , who is one of the founders of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Operation Sail ; IVilliant H. Ewen , president of the Steamship Historical Society of America , down from Rhode Island for the day ; and Professor Stephen Jacobs , ( Architecture ) , a historic-preservation huff down from Cornell University for the day . The old curmudgeon began telling Frank Braynard that Op Sail was the greatest thing that had happened to New York City since the Hudson-Fulton Celebration . " That was 1909 , " said Mr. Brayna rd . " Yes , " said the curmudgeon . " With practically the entire United States Navy , and a reproduction of Robert Fulton 's steamboat , the first to ply the Hudson River . " " It was the North River Steam Boat , " Braynard said , " though today everybody thinks Fulton 's boat was named the Clermont . " Alfred Van Santvnord Olcott , Jr. , joining us , said , " One of the finest ships of my family 's Hudson River Day Line , which we finally had to sell , was named after Robert Fulton . She 's gone now , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship , the Washington Irving , one of the fastest vessels on this country 's inland waterways , and a gem . She was licensed to carry six thousand passengers . She went down within sight of this building when she was rammed in 1926 by an oil barge . We got all but three of the passengers off safely . My family 's heart was broken . " " Mine , too , " said the curmudgc . " I attended her launching , in Camden , New Jersey , in 1913 , when I was only fourteen years old , but my shrieks of excitement were drowned out by the ululations of a posse of redheads , an all-girl contingent from Washington Irving High School . " " Yes , " said Olcott . " We had planned to invite the entire student body of the high school , until we found out how large it was Then my grandfather said , ' Let 's just extend the invitation to all red-headed girl students . ' " " I thank your grandfather , " said the curmudgeon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've been doing it ever since . " He turned and looked out the window . " The loss of the Washington Irving was a turning point in steamboating on the Hudson . With her speed , with her daytime cabins amidships , each one opening on a private segment of deck space , with her splendid dining saloon abaft on the main deck , she offered something pretty grand in the way of inland travel . The Day Line could n't really afford to reproduce her , for even then people were seeking out the illusory pleasures of driving up the old Albany Post Road on weekends . " He peered intently at something across the river . " I think I see one of your surviving vessels tied up in the Morris Canal . The Chauncey M. Depew , is n't it , back from her later career in Bermuda as a ships ' tender ? " " Yes , " said Olcott . " She and the Peter Stuyvesant , up in Boston , are propeller-driven , but the only surviving sidewheeler is the Alexander Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the old curmudgeon said to us . " The Hamilton is the Last Hudson River sidewheel steamboat , " said 01-cott . " We handed together a couple of years ago and formed the Steamer Alexander Hamilton Society , whose purpose is to save her from extinction . " Another guest , who proved to be Dan Donovan , the . Alexander Hamilton purser , beamed at Mr. Olcott , and we all sat down to lunch . " This is not bad chicken , " the o.c. said . " I enjoy going to luncheons where there 's plenty of elbowroom for everybody . This is like New York back in 1909 . " " Ladies and gentlemen , " said 01- cott , " the Hamilton is in great danger . She 's sitting on a sandbank , with holes in her hull , down at Atlantic Highlands , near Sandy Hook . She continued in service after the family sold the Day Line , but she was retired on Labor Day in 1971 , and she 's been looking for a home ever since . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seaport . Then she was towed across the East River and put into storage at the old Navy Yard , in Brooklyn . Then a group of people who were going to make her into a floating restaurant bought her , but they found the cost of rebuilding her too great to handle . Now , as the salt water gets to work on her innards , her state of health grows a little bit worse every day . If something is n't done in a very short time , she 'll he beyond salvation . " " Something must he done , " said William Ewen . " She represents a hundred and fifty years of Hudson River steamboating , and she 's an impressive racing beauty . " " She 's a cathedral , " said Frank Braynard . " How many thousands of Americans have sent money to preserve Venice or Mont-Saint-Michell And here we have , right in our midst , another monument that must be saved . I ca n't think of anything more wonderful we could do than rescue this beautiful white swan of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's much easier in this country to preserve splendid old sailing ships than it is to preserve a slightly newer but magnificent old steamlina t . " Ann Bedell , an energetic worker on behalf of the Steamer Alexander Hamilton Society , spoke up to say that she had already got one bank , one foundation , and about two hundred and fifty individuals to promise financial support . " But we desperately need seventy-five thousand dollars in the next two months , and a total of three hundred and fifty thousand by mid-July , if we 're ever going to float her again , " she went on . " The Alexander Hamilton has been officially- listed by the State of New Jersey as a historic site , and the National Trust for Historic Preservation has come out in favor of our scheme . Thanks largely to the efforts of Senator Kennedy , the National Trust now has a Maritime Preservation Division , and we 've made an application to the people there . And I hope everyone in this room will do his hit . " Professor Jacobs said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , because he felt that it would make a superb mobile museum . Over dessert  --  vanilla ice cream and raspberry sherbet Mr. Olcott said , " After my family sold the Hudson River Day Line , we went straight off to Maine , because my father , who had a sailboat and a motorboat , said he wanted to live as near as possible to his boats , so he would n't have to use an automobile to get to them . My mother , whose name was Ruth , did n't like the idea of sailboats at all and would n't go near them . So when it came to the point of naming the sailboat , my father decided to call her Ruthless . " Neighborhood Story ABOUT three years ago , we first ABOU note of a sign , a plain square of white cardboard with black Magic Marker lettering , posted above and to the right of the doorway at 125 Sullivan Street , in an Italian neighborhood in the Village . It read : Piano Playing Not Mine . B. DeVito The sign has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Anthony , which occupies lower Sullivan Street in June . It is the only handwritten sign posted on the exterior of any building on this street . Until a year ago , we had no clue to the sign 's meaning or its author , although from time to time we heard some ragtime piano , and also some recorded Caruso arias , coming from 125 Sullivan Street . We asked several people in the neighborhood , including two men in hats whose office is the intersection of Prince and Sullivan Streets , and whose responses were " I do n't know " and " What do I know ? I do n't know nothin ' . " Later , we asked Louis Barre , the neighborhood carpenter . " You do n't want to know , " he said . Even Frankie Pierre , a regular at Vinnie 's Luncheonette , where the free-lance conversationalists drop in for espresso , did n't care to offer much more . " DeVito ? That 's Bobby De-Vito . You know , that 's that kid . " Having said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman sitting at the back end of the counter remarked that she had heard that Bobby DeVito played the piano we were in Willy DePauli 's grocery store , on Sul- " Would you please welcome Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Garfield ! " livan Street  --  a comfortable little shop that has been run since 1913 by the most congenial grocer in New York . As usual , Willy was being subjected to a monologue by a neighborhood resident ; this time it was a young man in his late twenties who was talking on the subject of taxicab-company procedures . The young man towered over the counter and had on a loose-fitting tan raincoat , which was buttoned , even though it was July . He wore his hair straight and long , parted low and swept across his forehead , and he had a patchy Vandyke beard , which looked like graffiti . In a tenor voice that had plenty of wind pushing it , he spoke about taxi procedures with unflagging enthusiasm , weaving and bobbing , signalling and directing non-stop . " But you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm trying to get a job with the company  --  maybe part-time , like one or two days a week , " the young man said . He paused , then said , " I 'm still waiting for them to fix my piano , you know . It 's over a year , Willy , and they still ca n't get it in tune . Over a year . I need to play , boy . All I do is listen to my Caruso records . " We introduced ourself and found that we were meeting Bobby DeVito . We very quickly learned these things : that the recorded Caruso music we heard occasionally coming from 125 Sullivan Street came from Bobby DeVito 's apartment ; that the homemade ragtime piano music we heard occasionally d'cl not , and had caused him to write the disclaimer " Piano Playing Not Mine ; " that he was a pianist ; that he had his reputation as a pianist to protect ; that he transcribed Caruso arias for the upper registers of the piano ; that he had once played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once played at the Kings-bridge Veterans Hospital , in the Bronx , near his sister 's house ; and that he had played other engagements around the city  --  at senior citizens ' homes , at private clubs , and so on . We learned by looking at Willy DePauli 's face that the neighborhood had not decided whether Bobby DeVito could or could not actually play the piano . " I 'll have a concert soon , " Bobby DeVito concluded . Then he bowed low and shook our hand with both of his , thanked us several times , and , on leaving , told us that Willy would know as soon as the concert date was set . After Bobby DeVito had gone , we asked Willy , " Can he play ? " Willy replied , " He says so , I know some people who said they heard he could play . I never heard him . And he does n't work . Who knows ? " In the next few months , we saw a lot of Bobby DeVito : on the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the walk  --  mostly girls , who let his best salutations die  --  or standing for long periods in the doorway of 125 Sullivan Street with his mother , a cheerful-looking woman called josie , and a hyperactive dog on a tight leash . Every now and then , in the early mornings , he would fly into Vinnie 's Luncheonette and holler " I 've got a car ! Anyone going to the airport ? Cheaper than a taxi ! " and then storm out . Once he had made our acquaintance , he was not shy about stopping us on the corner . " When can we hear you play ? " we always asked . " I 'm going to he on Joe Franklin , " he promised . Eventually , Louis Borre , the carpenter , told us that in fact DeVito had been on Joe Franklin 's television program . " I forgot who told me , " he said . Then , several weeks ago , Bobby DeVito approached us with a photocopied handbill announcing a concert at the Greenwich House Music School . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
