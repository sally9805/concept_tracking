Notes and Comment THE papers last week brought us news of the Loss of a piece of American history and the restoration of a piece of Russian history . The piece of American history  --  what President Nixon said to his chief of staff , H. R. Haldeman , on June 20 , 1972 , three days after the Watergate break-in -- was short , but it was crucial . The fate of an Administration seemed to hang on how it disappeared . For the moment , all we have left is an **26;4575;TOOLONG hum . The piece of Russian history what happened to tens of millions of people in forced-labor camps in the first several decades of Soviet ride  --  was long , and also crucial . In neither country did the authorities show any eagerness to hear any of this news . The Soviet authorities called Alexander Solzhenitsyn a " traitor " and suggested that he get out of the Soviet Union . A campaign of letter writing against Solzhenitsyn on the part of the " public " was organized by the authorities . Letters flooded into Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had experience with officially inspired letter campaigns to television stations . The difference is that in Russia the television commentators and the authorities are one and the same , whereas here the men on television still cling to a measure of independence . ) About the Watergate news the Soviet authorities have nothing to say . Like Solzhcnitsyn 's book , comment would hurt detente . Our authorities likewise blame the bearers of the news for the tidings they do n't like . They tell us that the Watergate news that has been inundating its for the last year is the work of television , the press , and political enemies . On Solzhenitsyn dill ? have no comment . But whereas Solzhenitsyn is all but suffocated in the totalitarian murk of the Soviet Union , and can be made to disappear at any moment , we still breathe the air of freedom , and can think and act without reprisal . Even Solzhenitsyn is in certain ways sustained by our freedom . His voice can be heard because there is a part of the world where independent voices are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated entirely by the well-amplified voices of the authorities sending themselves messages of support . And not only are we in the free countries the last forums for independent voices  --  we are the repository of the world 's culture and known history . lATe are the keepers of the record , ( In China last week , the authorities took out after Schubert and Beethoven . ) One of our obligations is not to let gaps appear . For the moment , the gap in this nation 's part of the record is only eighteen and a half minutes long . In the Soviet Union , the gap is decades long . There Solzhenitsyn , at the peril of his life , has rescued the memory of millions from darkness . Here , where the going is still easy and action is still possible , we let the erasers of the record continue with their work . If they are permitted to go all the way , there will he no record left , here or anywhere else . An American Solzhenitsyn , should we he lucky enough to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gap then would swallow us all , and the global hum could go on for centuries . Commissioner NOT long after Elinor Guggen- heimer took office as Mayor Beanie 's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs , we had breakfast with her at her apartment , on Park Avenue . It was a snowy morning ; she was wearing a bright-red pants suit with the bottoms tucked into knee-high black hoots . On our arrival , Mrs. Guggenheimer was in the kitchen glaring at an electric coffee percolator . " Something 's wrong with this pot , " she said . " Must he one I got at a hank . I 'm glad the State Legislature has finally limited the banks ' giveaway-premium programs . The best bank the consumer can have is a solid one that pays interest that does n't disappear if you take your money out a few days early . Excuse me while I put these English muffins in the oven . " After casting a baleful look at all her appliances , the Commissioner led us into her living room . " I 've been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the Commissioner , who has been married even longer than that to Randolph Guggenheimer , a partner in the law firm of Guggenheimer Untermyer . " I like city government , but I 'd never thought about holding this job , because it always looked to me like a ' woman 's job , ' and I never liked women 's jobs . ' But I was wrong . It 's a real job , and I 'm thrilled to be in it . It has its frustrations , though . I have power , but not enough to resolve many situations . One trouble is that consumer questions are spread across three levels of government  --  federal , state , and local  --  and a lot of them tend to fall between three stools . Another frustration is that to have a better complaint system than we do would cost more money than we have . I 'm hoping we can learn something from the Police Department 's 911 setup . Sure , we have phones  --  Pm planning to handle one of them myself one day soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls that come in  --  but we 're not yet organized for that quick a response . The best thing about my job is that our department is one that exists to serve people on every level  --  social , economic , ethnic , whatever . The common-denominator department , you could say . We 're the agency that represents the individual against the --  well , not exactly against the establishment . Against the organization . Oh , my God , I can ? ? fusion is by a Russian , and so on . I had an 8:45 A.M. staff meeting every day for three years . " We asked him how he felt . " I fed light-headed and light-shouldered , " he said . Milk Route N one-thirty on a cold Wednesday morning , a milk truck is parked outside a dairy in the northern Bronx . The truck , which belongs to one of the last remaining independent milk-route owners making deliveries to Manhattan homes , was loaded several hours earlier by a dairy employee . Now its driver checks to make sure that all the quart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and five cases of them , twelve bottles to a case  --  art aboard , and at the dairy 's platform loading area he picks up the so-called by-products that will also be needed on the route : four cases of quart bottles of orange juice ( also twelve bottles to a case ) , two and a half cases of quart bottles of skim milk , two cases of quart bottles of ninety-nine-per-cent milk , twenty-four quart cardboard containers of homogenized milk , and various amounts of chocolate milk , buttermilk , light cream , heavy cream , half-and-half , and eggs . He then drives the truck , an aging white-painted steel step-in van , south on the almost empty Major Deegan Expressway . The route 's boundaries are West 101st Street , West 115th Street , Central Park West , and Riverside Drive , and within that area there are eight hundred customers , in two hundred apartment buildings  --  half the customers receiving deliveries on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday mu rnin gs , and half on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturday mornings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Major Deegan and proceeds a few blocks to a nursery school , his only stop outside the route 's boundaries . It is two o'clock . He opens the back of the truck , removes the twenty-four containers of milk ( the school 's customary order ) , and carries them in a wire basket to the school 's front door . He opens the door with one of thirty or forty keys on a key chain , moves quickly down a linoleum-covered corridor to a kitchen , and opens the door of a refrigerator . Inside the refrigerator he finds a note reading " Please leave just twenty containers today . " He puts twenty containers of milk in the refrigerator and retraces his steps to the truck , carrying the four surplus containers . The driver , a retired teamster , who is fifty and looks older and graver than his years , appears uninterested in why four fewer containers than usual are wanted . He is n't a speculative man or a curious one . He has acknowledged that in all the months he has been delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the classrooms that lie along the corridor on his way to the kitchen . The truck sails down Broadway , past mostly darkened and shuttered stores , to I 1 1 th Street , where , at two-fifteen , the driver is joined by two helpers  --  a middle-aged Englishman and a young man from the Dominican Republic . On the truck 's dashboard is a stack of flash cards , one for every apartment building on the Monday-Wednesday-Friday run . The cards are arranged in route order , and THE NEW YORKER pay their hills reliably , but they do n't drink a great deal of milk . The second part of the route , starting at the housing project , is what the driver describes as " low-class " ? made up of welfare people and low-paid working people , who are billed biweekly and are given to moving without paying their last bills ( the route owner can lose over a thousand dollars a year when they skip ) ; most of them are Puerto Rican , and they drink a lot of milk . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings . The driver puts four plastic shells on a hand truck and wheels it into the elevator of one of the project buildings . ( This method is faster than transferring them to the metal carriers . ) He presses " 17 , " and the elevator , a temperamental machine , eventually carries him there . Each project-building card says " K.O.D. " ( knock on door ) ; if the people in the projects do n't take in their milk the moment it is deposited on their doorsteps , it may be stolen . The driver raps sharply on each door . Sleepy-looking women in nightgowns or housecoats come to the door promptly . Most of them gather up the bottles of milk wordlessly , but whenever one of them says hello to the driver he say 's , " Hello , darling , how are you this morning ? " The truck is parked at 109th Street and Amsterdam Avenue at 5:10 A.m . In the three blocks of 109th Street between Manhattan Avenue and Broadway the three men deliver over fifty cases of milk  --  almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West 109th Street are dilapidated . Almost all of them are walk-ups . Their front doors are open , their mailboxes are broken , their hallways are narrow and strewn with garbage and covered with graffiti , their staircases are steep , their tenants own a good number of barking dogs . In the walkups , the milkmen start their deliveries on the ground floor , to lighten their loads as they climb the stairs . In one five-story tenement on West 109th Street the driver drops off sixty-six bottles of milk , chocolate milk , and orange juice at seventeen apartments in five min utes . By six o'clock on this cold Wednesday morning , the milk has been delivered . The two helpers depart for day jobs in Riverdale , where the Englishman is a building superintendent and the young man from the Dominican Republic is a building porter . The driver sets out to collect a few hills for the route owner before returning to the dairy with the empties , the four containers of milk , and an extra case or two of milk , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Angelo Guagenti , who is a thirty-year-old bantv of a man with wavy hair , a mustache , a stutter , and fifteen years of experience in the milk business , sits in an all-night restaurant on Broadway drinking coffee and talking shop . At the age of fifteen , he went to work as a milkman 's helper . He dropped out of high school at eighteen and spent the next nine years as a salaried milk-route driver . A couple of years ago , he acquired a Milk and Milk Products Class B retail license for Manhattan , a second-hand truck , and a milk route ( that is , a list of established customers in an area ) of his own . He is proud that he has built up his business from forty-five cases a morning to over a hundred . " Everyone says the milk route is dying , but as far as I 'm concerned it 's not yet dead , " he says . " I 'll survive as long as there are still people who prefer to drink milk our of glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore  --  and people who are lazy about going to the supermarket to gut their milk and are willing to pay a few cents more to have it delivered to their doorsteps . I think milk tastes much better out of glass hotties than out of cardboard containers , and my customers agree .
