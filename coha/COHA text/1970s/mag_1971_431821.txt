 | A GUANIAMO DIAMOND MINER IS NOBODY 'S BEST FRIEND The Bad Life in theVenezuelan Jungle A Venezuelan diamond miner would do anything for a shiny piece of carbon . He would get up at six o'clock every morning seven days a week to dig holes and trenches for ten and twelve and fourteen hours a day under the hot tropical sun . He would sleep in a hammock ; tolerate the tropical jungle diseases and poisonous snakes and the lack of drinking water , the card sharps , the pool hustlers , the whores who pick pockets and have venereal disease . And after that he would pay sixtyfive cents for a Coke . For a diamond , a diamond miner will do anything . Some diamond miners have a bad reputation . Example : one day two miners went into the jungle to prospect . Shall we call them Sam and Frank ? Well , Sam returned with a fistful of diamonds and Frank .. . well , the way Sam tells it , Frank was walking by the river and he fell in and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river boa , or Frank got bitten by a tiger butterfly snake and died , bless his soul , or Frank got eaten by cannibals , or . . . A lot of things could have happened to Frank in the jungle . There is no doubt about that . But what is Sam 's credibility quotient the first time he returns without a Frank ? The second ? The third ? People get a bad reputation when their friends make a habit of meeting disaster in the jungle . Georges de Steinheil , the man who makes all the travel posters for the tourist bureau of Venezuela , used to mine diamonds in Brazil before he turned to professional photography for a living . He recalled a day in Brazil ? a hot day and no diamonds , and he was sitting at the bar in a makeshift mining camp . Two miners next to him were drunk and arguing . One bet the other that he could shoot a man in the ear with a pistol at fifty paces and make him spin around . A total stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet in the ear , spun halfway around , and fell down dead . The miner won his bet . It was the jungle . The Venezuelan government has a very relaxed philosophy about the tens of thousands of diamond miners spread through the hot , tropical jungles lying below the Orinoco River . Live and let live . Since World War II , Venezuela has had a boom economy . The huge oil reserves found below Lake Maracaibo in northwestern Venezuela brought in foreign capital ? Shell , Esso , BP , Texaco ? and assured the government of money . Taxes on the three million barrels of oil exported daily from Venezuela provide steady revenue . Diamonds ? The Ministry of Mines levies a 3 percent tax on diamonds from the jungle mines . The tax yields a pittance in comparison with the money oil brings in . The government 's revenues from the oil trade in 1969 amounted to $1.2 billion . Venezuela considers the diamond-trade revenue so negligible that official figures are not available ; calculations based on 1969 production and exchange figures show that Venezuela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lifeblood of the nation ; diamonds just have n't been that important . Yet there they are in the jungles of Venezuela , one of the few countries where an independent diamond miner can still take them legally . He can keep what he finds , and lately there seem to be a lot of diamonds to find in Venezuela . One handwritten ledger records the progress of diamond mining in Venezuela . It sits in the office of the Ministry of Mines in the new blue-glass government office building in the center of Caracas . For the first six months of 1969 the total diamond production for Venezuela was just over 42,000 carats . The second six months of 1969 showed a diamond production of more than 150,000 carats . The total diamond production for the year ( 193,784.14 carats ) was the  | highest ever recorded in Venezuela . ( In 1965 , ) .956 carats were produced . ) What happened ? What happened was a strike at San Salvador de Paul , once a tiny jungle village near the Caroni River . Since World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining in their own countries , have been drifting in through the jungles , the back door of Venezuela . During this time , various diamond strikes in Venezuela have attracted hundreds and sometimes several thousands of hopeful miners . But none of them ever came close to the strike at San Salvador de Paul . The jungle outpost of eight or ten people grew into a boomtown of 15,000 miners ? more than half of them Venezuelans , a sizable - umber of them Brazilians and Colombians , the rest a mixture of Lebanese , Mexicans , and French . It used to work this way : A Sam and a Frank go into the jungle , and then a long time later they reappear in style . They suddenly have some money . They put up at the Gran Hotel in Ciudad Bolivar and drink and whore and gamble and spend their money until they are broke , and then they go back into the jungle . But San Salvador de Paul was a bulla , diamond strike , and this time other miners followed . Production soared . Miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nowhere to buy diamonds with satchels full of , 500-bolivar* ( $100 ) notes . There were eight movie houses . Whores lined up at the airport in Ciudad Bolivar begging for a seat on a plane ; thousands of : hem made it to San Salvador de Paul . Americans with nicknames like Tex appeared out of nowhere with light planes , flying sides of beef to the mines . A profitable venture . Tex made as much as $2000 profit on each trip , and he sometimes made five trips a day . The boom continued through 1970 . For the first six months of that year more than 275,000 carats of diamonds were found in Venezuela , nearly one and a * The bolivar is approximately 4.4 to the dollar . half times the total production of 1969 . At that point the dry season made it impossible to mine diamonds at San Salvador de Paul , for the mining process requires water . Then news came of an even richer strike at Guaniamo , 250 miles to the southwest . All the miners , their women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Guaniamo . The diamond buyers agree that the diamonds there are of even higher quality than the diamonds at San Salvador de Paul . Guaniamo , the newest strike of all , is in a region of the jungle where diamonds have never been found before . Oscar Yanes , the director of Venezuela 's Televisora Nacional , sent a crew of cameramen into the jungle to film the new strike . A miner showed the camera a handful of diamonds belonging to him and his partner . They had found them in one week . The diamonds were worth $10,000 . Guaniamo lies in deep jungle at the source of the Cuchivero River , and is accessible only by helicopter ( or foot ) from Ciudad Bolivar , over 200 miles away . ( Ciudad Bolivar is an hour 's flight from Caracas . ) There is the possibility of more strikes in the Guaniamo region , and when the rainy season comes again , there will still be all those diamonds back at San Salvador de Paul . The boom continues . A few keep their wealth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of becoming rich overnight is an irresistible lure , and that is why there are more than 15,000 people in the jungle at Guaniamo , its whole economy supported by the small palmfuls of tiny crystalline diamonds taken from the earth . The miners , the whores , the airplane pilots , the shopkeepers are all supported by the diamonds . It is a rough life . The government prohibits alcohol in the mining camps on the grounds that it leads to fighting and to killing . The Guardia Nacional is there to keep order , and it tries to enforce the prohibition . But there is always some liquor around , and always some way to buy off the guard . And there is always the tropical heat  | as well , and the insects and the unsanitary conditions and the undrinkable water , but everyone stays on as long as there are diamonds to be found and money to be made . @# Johnny Volpe , a Venezuelan , the movie magnate of Venezuela 's diamond mines , was sitting on a wooden bench outside his canvas-ceilinged , canvas-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speaking , a Louis B. Mayer of the jungle , only precocious ? not yet thirty . Johnny twirls his Pancho Villa mustache and talks about the movie business . His best film ? Well , without a doubt it was a Chuck Connors special called Cowboy : Go Kill Them All and Come Back Alone . It really packed them in , two full shows . In the mines " action is number one over sex . " The worst ? The worst was drama , absolutely no good . The sex films were skin flicks , and they did well , but the action films were closer to the miners ' way of life . El Candado is the main mining camp of Guaniamo . Johnny Volpe had his movie theater , made of canvas and logs and log seats and gasoline-station tricolor plastic flags , set on a small hill overlooking the camp . " Wait until the evening . You 'll see what it is like then . Come and watch me pull the suckers in . A little before showtime , eight o'clock , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife were all crowded onto the platform in the back of the room , huddled over the Bell &; Howell , fiddling around , and all they could get out of the projector was an image that jumped . They gave up and set up the reserve projector . Then Johnny grabbed the mike , flipped on the switch , and began a sales pitch that blared from the speakers outside and could be heard all over camp : " FANTASTIC . INCREDIBLE . PLENTY OF ACTION . LOTS OF INDIANS . " It was hard to believe that he was describing The Oregon Trail , a 1936 movie about the Lewis and Clark Expedition starring Fred MacMurray . The house was almost full ? it seats about 100 ? and the man who sold peanuts and candy bars outside the door , producing his wares from a burlap sack , did a fine business . The miners , with the help of the Spanish subtitles , sensed that Fred MacMurray was not cut out to be an explorer , but whenever someone caught an arrow in the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled for more . At 5 bolivars a head , and 100 heads , Johnny had done all right , and tomorrow night there would be another film . There was a new film every night , and the only costs were the film and the electricity from the generator . Johnny and his wife were about $18,000 ahead for the year . @# Johnny twirls his black mustache some more : ye . it sure is an amazing world . Only two years ago he had been busted . The miners , yes , they were al : crazy , yes , completely crazy . They got skin infections from the water . After a while , the skin of the miners turned yellow . Their livers were bothering them . And at the Caracol camp nearby , six to eight to ten divers got the bends every year and became crippled . And the planes . Yes , the airlines were so greed. , for a profit that they kept the planes in the air all the time , and the planes were always overloaded , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were ready to fly . Every two weeks there was a plane landing in the jungle . Three weeks ago a Cherokee lost one of its engines only a few minutes after leaving Cuchiverito . They turned back and put the other engine on takeoff power . They were over the jungle and they could see the field and the airstrip , but the last engine went , and the whole plane exploded in the sky . " Six were killed . Five miners and one woman . She was a whore . " And the killing . Yes , last week there was a killing . Cigarron ( " Little Cigar " ) was drinking with his friend Harina Pan ( " Flour Bread " ) . They had been everywhere together and mined all over Venezuela together , but there were some words , and they were drinking rum . Because of what was said , Harina Pan stabbed his friend right through the heart , and Cigarron died . It was very sad , and the Guardia Nacional had no place to put Harina Pan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie house . He was here for two days . I felt so sorry for him . He looked so unhappy . I do n't know where he is now , probable somewhere in the jails in Ciudad Bolivar . Of course , there was the Brazilian . He did not know anything about helicopters . It was one of those jet helicopters , a Ranger . You know how much noise one of them makes , and you ca n't hear anything else . Well , he did n't hear them yelling when he tried to walk around the back . His head , completely chopped off . It went fifteen meters . He never saw the back propeller .. . It is not that Johnny has an especially lugubrious mind that fastens on every violent death that happens . It is just that life in the diamond mines is incredibly rugged . The miners of South America have a reputation . Professor Richard E. Schultes of Harvard spent a total of thirteen years in the Colombian jungles alone ? no guides , no party tours , just himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not fear the jungle , but he does not care for the miners . " The jungle is way overrated by people who have not been there ? just keep a level head and you will have no problem , " he says . Above all , " Do n't drink with the miners . " No one is close to Schultes in his understanding of the jungle and the Indians and their medicines and their drugs , and when Professor Schultes says not to drink with the miners , he means : DO N'T DRINK WITH THE MINERS .  | Quino Lorinez , twenty-six years old , son of a stationery-store owner in Caracas , was sitting on the side of his hammock , swinging slowly back and forth and puffing on a small cigar . The roof of his rancho ( " hut " ) was red plastic laid over a frame of saplings cut from the jungle . He was young , with light brown hair , and good-looking , and his skin was bronze from the sun . It was too hot in the day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open pit . He talked about the early days : Yes , before the planes came and the helicopters and the people , it was much different . These miners , they were animals . They were strong like mules . They got to the last town , Las Pavas , then they packed their shovel and their surruca and as much food as they could carry , and they started walking on foot through the jungle . Some of them even packed a : fifty-pound water pump besides the other forty Bounds of food and equipment . Those , they were Definitely crazy . Six days , seven days , eight days : hrough the jungle walking up mountains and down mountains . Then they dug for diamonds for a week , or two weeks , until the food ran out . Then back through the jungle , a week , maybe more , without good sometimes , back to Las Pavas . Miners who had ood would n't sell it to those who had run out . Forty bolivars $10 for a can of sardines . Never . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food ran out , I had to start back or I would die . It was before the Guardia Nacional even tried to keep order , and : here was sometimes drinking and fights ; miners killed each other . Yes , he had seen one miner rip out another miner 's throat with his teeth . It was nothing to talk about . Now life was easy . . . And as for the diamonds : the compradors ( " buyers " ) were all thieves . In San Salvador de Paul they paid 200 bolivars a carat , and . here they paid only 180 bolivars a carat . For a one-carat stone of good quality , perhaps they would pay 350 bolivars , and for the best-quality 4-carat stone they paid 4500 bolivars , and if you were very lucky and found a top-quality 10-carat stone , they might pay 20,000 bolivars . But those were good-quality diamonds . For a carat of dirty diamonds , industrial diamonds , nongem quality , maybe 10 bolivars a carat .. . Quino had seen one black diamond during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly half a carat . The comprador paid 1000 bolivars for it , and : t was a beautiful stone . Quino made the same complaints all miners made . All his money went for drink and putas and cards . He had planned to come to the mines and save money for a car , but when he made a score ( and one week he made 5000 bolivars for his half-share of the diamonds ) , he did what everyone else did . A week later he was broke , broke without leaving the mines . It used to be that the miners went : o Ciudad Bolivar to spend their money , but now the gamblers and the whores were right on hand . The whores were 150 bolivars for a night , 50 bolivars for an hour , and the gamblers got the rest . There was one rule of the mines : the miners never kept their money . Even if they left the mines , a month later , two months later , they always came back , broke . @# Night had fallen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no neon signs to light up the sky . The electric generator shut off at ten o'clock . Back in the jungle somewhere a panther yowled at a moon that was out of phase . Only little dots of stars sprinkled the sky . The miners who were still about carried their flashlights and aimed them down in their path so they would be sure not to tread on a snake . The beams of light could be seen moving up and down the sides of the hill to the camp . The canvas-covered hut on Main Street was a food store and a dining room . Johnny Volpe ate there , and his movie poster advertising the coming attraction was tacked to one wall . There was a store and a card game and a pool table on the other side of the street , a 4 ' by 8 ' bar pool table with a cue ball larger than any object ball . Five bolivars a rack of pool . The table had been airlifted into the jungle piece by piece . There were five tables in El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark , and a few miners were standing around the green-felted pool table in the store on the left , talking in low tones , with cues in their hands . Main Street was very narrow , a dirt path just wide enough for two . A diamond buyer turned off the light to his stand . He had been sorting the yellow diamonds from the jewels , the flawed stones from ones with perfect octagonal shape and no carbon in the middle . He had been weighing diamonds with his tiny cup scales and looking at them with his magnifier and moving them with his tweezers all day and all night . He crumpled up the sheet of white diamond paper that he had been sorting the stones on and tossed it into the corner . Then he retreated behind the black curtain in his stand , back to his open hammock and the hiding place for his diamonds and his gun . The other buyers on the street had closed . Main Street took a one-foot step down over a tree root and turned to the left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to bet the 5 y 6 for the horses at La Rinconada and the place to mail letters , was still open . Most of the street was dark . The shops with gold jewelry hanging in the front , or with pots and pans and soap and medicine , or with eggs and meat and loaves of bread had shut down for the night . The three red tanks perched in a tree ? shower , 2 Bs. ? and the three tin shower stalls were quiet and empty . But not everyone was asleep . A beautiful dark-skinned woman with a thin face , a professional gambler , was looking at her cards very carefully . Her feet were on a dirt floor , and she sat at a table of rough wood next to an Andean miner in a red shirt . The woman wore an expensive lace blouse and a gold necklace . There was not much  | light in the room for the card players ; the oil lamp flickered , and their eyes were in shadows . Money passed after every hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were five at the table : three miners , the woman , and another professional gambler . The man dealt the cards in an odd flicking motion off the front of the deck . The hand was quicker than the eye . Was he dealing the top card or the second one ? The miners were drinking , and they were sure to lose their money . Farther down the street , beyond the room hidden from view where the five played cards , there were more silent and dark ranchos , and then the street came to an end . The little river , five feet across , that rushed down a tiny ravine could not be seen . The chocolate water was there though , gurgling and bubbling and rushing by in the night . The log that was the bridge led to the red-light zone . The whores were there , and the miners who were rich for a week . There was a twelve-year-old whore in camp , and she could charge more because she was so young and everyone wanted her . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for one of the airlines unloading supplies and food from the planes and putting it on the helicopters , noticed two whores waiting at the table . He smiled at them and talked to them and told them that they . were his girls . The big fat man with the clipboard and the Italian loafers and the checkered shirt and the big belly yelled at Tony to get back to work , but the voice was drowned out by the roar from the helicopters . The girls wore patent-leather sandals and canary yellow and purple slacks , and one had gold earrings and long hair , and the other short hair and no earrings . They sat on the chairs made from the hide of mountain cows , brown and white hides with a little hair , and they listened to Tony and they stroked their hair and they smiled and giggled . Their hair was dark and their eyes were a dark brown and their skin bronze , and the whore with the gold earrings had a gold tooth and she smiled the most of all . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , and the whores had to get into the helicopter for the ride to the mines a few miles away . Tony put his arms around them and said good-bye , and then he spoke in English so they would not understand . " These are my girls . " Smile . And he squeezed them tighter , and continued . " Get a piece of ass at the mines , get the clap for sure . " There are no doctors at Guaniamo. @# The thing about diamond miners is that they are eternal optimists . Today is always the day that they will find the big stone that will make them rich . Every day is a day with new hope , and the minute the sun comes up , off they dash to their digs . The miners at El Candado stake out a claim as near a ravina ( " little river " ) as possible . Then they usually do an open-pit excavation , digging out a square plot about fifteen feet or so to a side . The earth is piled up to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , all the earth containing it is piled separately from the rest . Then , after a few days of digging , the miners stop . Either there is too much water in their pit and their gasoline-powered water pump is no longer effective , or they have come to the end of the blue clay . Or after digging for several days , they have found no blue clay and must try another spot .  | The ton or so of blue day is carried away ? from 20 feet to 100 yards ? down : o a ravina . Shovelful by shovelful the clay is washed in the surruca , which is three concentric sieves . The miner bends over , the water halfway up his calves . His back is the spring . With his arms and knees slightly bent and his hands grasping the wooden rims of the surruca , the miner turns the sieves in jerky quarter turns , ' ke the action of a washing machine , except the motion always in the same direction . Besides the turning motion , there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water and turns it half-submerged ; then he holds the surruca against one leg while he reaches in with a hand and crunches unwillg clods of clay so that the water will wash away the rt and leave the gravel . When there is only gravel left , the miner takes the : . bp sieve with the biggest screen holes and runs his hands over the stones left . Any diamond that size , 0 or 20 carats , is easy to spot . Then , on to the second sieve . Any medium-sized diamond of 4 to 10 carats will not be missed . The miners look with educated eyes . A wet , gleaming piece of quartz reflecting the bright tropical sun and sparkling in all directions looks very much like a diamond to the novice , but the miner does not even give it a second glance . More Likely he is pleased that there are a lot of small , round pebbles , some black and some red and orange , a the second surruca . These are indicaciones , indica:ions . Where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamonds were formed from carbon many ages ago , a lot of near diamonds were made . These are the indicaciones . The third sieve is where most of diamonds are found . There is a reason for that special surruca stroke . There is a reason that the three concentric sieves have screens that are cone-shaped rather than round-bottomed . Diamonds have a specific gravity of 3.5. 1 indicaciones have a specific gravity of around 3.0 . Other stones are less dense . Water , of course , has a specific gravity of 1.0 . The swirling and slightlychurning surruca motion helps wash away the dirt , . at is true , but much more important , it sifts the material into layers . In the third sieve , the lightest stones are on top , and at the very bottom of the cone is a concentration of stones with the greatest density . The miners poke about in the third sieve with their fingers for a little , and then they flip the sieve ewer on land , and carefully look in the top of the cone for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees the sparkle of a really perfect We-white gem . The diamonds do not sparkle like the diamonds in storefront displays since they have not yet been cut , but they sparkle all the same . The miner plucks the diamond from the gravel and puts it in his mouth and keeps looking . When he 's done , he takes the diamond from his mouth and puts it in a Vicks inhaler vial called a penetro . To make a penetro he takes the inhaler out of the plastic vial and bores a hole in the cap . He puts a piece of string through the hole and holds it in place by pouring in hot wax and cooling it . The miner ties the string to his belt and wears the penetro inside his belt next to his skin , or in the watch pocket of his blue jeans . The minute a miner gets a few good diamonds , off to the buyers , and if it is a good score , the miner will give a few of the diamonds to his favorite whore . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Then the miner will bribe the Guardia National to get some drink , and he will play poker or ajiley or pifi or truco ( gin rummy games ) , or he will throw the dados ( dice ) , or he will bet on a cockfight if there is one , or he will send out bets from the mines on the 5 y 6 at La Rinconada , and he will sleep with his whore in her hammock until all the money is gone . Then , back to digging , and turning and jiggling the surruca ; hungry nights , fever , and bad water . Someday they will find the big diamond , like Barabas , and then they will become famous . The newspapers say that Barabas got paid 40,000 bolivars for his diamond , but the miners know that that is only part of the story . The diamond buyers put Barabas up at the best hotel in Caracas and settled on a price of 120,000 bolivars ( at that time the bolivar was 3 to the dollar ) for the gem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hotel , and for the fine women and the clothes and the wild nights on the town , and gave Barabas the remainder , 40,000 bolivars . But soon he was broke again and back at the mines . Of course , the diamond buyers made a profit , but who can call them thieves ? The diamonds from the Barabas gem sold for a total of $200,000 . A neat profit of $160,000 . Barabas is still in the Venezulean diamond fields , poor and old and still looking for another big diamond . 61
