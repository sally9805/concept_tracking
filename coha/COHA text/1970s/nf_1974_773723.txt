To lose sixteen children almost at birth is something besides bad luck . Anne was never as healthy as she looked when she was young . " Gout in the stomach , " as she called it , gave her indigestion and " hysterical affections " and an occasional convulsive " Fitt . " She also complained of " gout in the bowels . " It may have been real gout , of course , in her knee and her foot which , later , made her need a stick or even two sticks for walking ? but this is a symptom of porphyria too .

Anne 's constant preg-nancies were a direct affront to Mary 's inability to conceive ; and any-way , long before Mary returned to England as queen , Anne had sought and found an intimate friend . She had a strong emotional need to look up to and adore someone . Her choice was Sarah Jennings , later Mrs. John Churchill and fi-nally , as her husband rose in rank as well as fame , the Duchess of Marl-borough . They had played together as children . Sarah had come to court at twelve , under the wing of her sister Frances , who was in the household of Anne 's young stepmother . Charles II was king then ? the year was 1673 ? and Mary of Modena still only Duchess of York , a kind , beautiful , and virtuous young woman . Princess Anne was eight .

Sarah , beautiful , intelligent , almost uneducated , and frighteningly ambitious , was born to rule and command . She began by ruling the Princess Anne and , when Princess Anne became queen , ruled , with the help of her husband , Queen Anne and all of England . The great period in English history called the reign of Queen Anne was not hers at all , but theirs . Anne 6 1 They made a remarkable quartet , Sarah and John , who would have been vividly outstanding characters in any company , against any back-ground ; dull , fat , ailing Anne ; poor little Est-il possible . To rid both couples of any stiffness which the acknowledgment of royalty might impose , Anne suggested that they call each other by play-names , Mr. and Mrs. Freeman and Mr. and Mrs. Morley . She thought of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Mrs. Freeman ) thought , and in privacy said to John . Mr. Freeman had to be often away from the fun and games . He was a soldier and there was a war on . Not because of his royal friends but because of real brilliance in the field ? and putting down the Monmouth Rebellion for King James ? he had made lieutenant-general . His de-serting James and going over to William of Orange was not the sort of thing a gentleman now would do , but it was like Churchill 's taking , when he was a young man and before he met Sarah ? he never looked at another woman after that ? money for a start in life from his rich mis-tress . It was the kind of thing that was perfectly all right to do then . Of course one had to have a thick skin .

( And with reason ? Churchill made advances to exiled King James while in the pay of the usurper William , whom he had helped bring to England . ) But when William died , his work un-finished , there was only one soldier he could recommend to his successor Anne . Under Anne , Churchill ? Marlborough ? achieved the victories William had dreamed of . Marlborough fought ten campaigns , " during which he had won four great battles and many secondary actions and combats , and had taken by siege thirty fortresses . In this process he had broken the military power of France . . . .

Sarah ? what seems to Marlborough 's biographer a " gracious , charming letter . " To me it seems a pathetic and ridiculous one : " It is very uneasy to your poor , unfortunate , faithful Morley to think that she has so very little in her power to show how truly sensible I am of all my lord Marlborough 's kindness , especially at a time when he de-serves all that a rich crown could give . But since there is nothing else at this time , I hope you will give me leave as soon as he comes to make him a duke .

Anne would never have noticed it herself . It had to be pointed out to her . Sarah had made the mistake of finding a place at court for a poor cousin of hers , Abigail Masham , and Abigail had gradually , subtly supplanted her in the Queen 's affections . The only wonder is that something of the kind had not happened sooner . Sarah 's " friendship " had always been abrasive . She had always quite openly shown her con-tempt of the Queen , and the Queen had always accepted it with smiling meekness as just Mrs. Freeman 's way . But finally Abigail and Sarah 's enemies ? she had many , and had earned them all ? convinced the Queen that the contempt was sincere and that all the biting words were in-tentional . She stripped Sarah of all her offices and emoluments , and removed her husband Marlborough from the command of the army . What this would do to the army did not worry her ? at least not enough . Louis XIV knew at once what the effect would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlborough , " he said , " will do all for us we desire . " Sarah was beside herself , of course , as furious as Marlborough was calm . But it was harder on Queen Anne than on the Marlboroughs when they left her court . They were retiring to much more than com-fort . They had grown rich in the service of the Queen , her father , and her brother-in-law . They had in the process of building ? Queen Anne could not halt this ? the palace of Blenheim , named in honor of Marl-borough 's greatest victory and voted him at public expense . And they had each other . John and Sarah Marlborough , each so full of flaws in character and in other relationships , had one of the great unflawed Anne 63 love stories in history , and they were allowed to live into old age together . Anne had lost her husband , whom she at least always took very seriously , and every one of her incredible brood of children . But in losing Sarah she had lost most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic friend had been the big thing in her life . Being a queen , seeing her armies conquer the Sun King 's , giving birth to her children and watching them die ? none of it had been as important to her as Sarah was . This is hard to believe , but if you hope to understand Queen Anne at all you must believe it . After the Marlboroughs left her court she gave herself up to unhappiness . Physically she had long been the most miserable of mortals . She is described in 1709 : " The poor lady ... was again under a severe fit of gout , ill-dressed , blotted in her countenance , and surrounded with plaisters , cataplaisma , and dirty-like rags . " M The Queen of England ! ? but all the descriptions agree : " Her Majesty was labouring under a fit of the Gout , and in extream pain and agony , and ... everything about her was in much the same disorder as about the meanest of her subjects . Her face , which was red and spotted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot affected was fixed up with a poultis and some nasty bandages . " t She was so wretched that she did not care how she looked , what she was doing to her subjects ' ideas of majesty ; and emotionally she was as distressed . As the end of her life neared , she was truly unhappy about the succession . She had always had a conflict about it . She had always known , really , that the child she had been told to think of as the warming-pan baby was her father 's true son and the heir to his throne ; she knew herself and her sister and brother-in-law to be usurpers . On the other hand , she knew as firmly as her fanatical Protestant upbringing could teach her that it was her duty to uphold the Church of England . " Was she to deliver her realm to civil war ? Above all , was she ... to give up her Crown ? No ? a thousand times no ! " $ James III made her decision easier for her .

Of course there was the Act of Settlement which gave it to the Hanover line , but that was a scrap of paper to these experienced double , triple , and quadruple dealers . James 64 Anne showed them how a gentleman , even in the wrong century to expect it , keeps his word . He indignantly refused . So Queen Anne 's leaving the crown to her half-brother would have been tantamount to dividing England again , and of course she did not do it . But she still remembered how George of Hanover had come to court , all those years ago , and had not stayed to propose to her . After his mother Sophia ? Anne did not like her either ? he would sit on her throne . And now it was being suggested that George even come to England early ? before she died ! ? and take his seat in the House of Lords as Duke of Cambridge .

She announced with vigor that none of that Hanoverian tribe would set foot in England while she lived . Her cousin the Electress Sophia was roused in her turn . On receipt of this message she stamped angrily back and forth the length of her garden , back and forth , her face getting redder all the time . Then she had a stroke and died , two months before Queen Anne . William 1650 ? 1702 AND Mary II 1662 ? 1694 Tnu succeeded to the throne in 1689 , upon the abdication of Mary 's father , James II . Or was it abdication ? Was it merely departure ? Had King James merely left , without forfeiting his rights ? This is what Alfonso XIII did when he left Spain in 1931 ; he did not sign away anything . Neither did James II . He considered himself King of England until he died , and his son considered himself and was called , by the Jacobites at least , James III . There was no question , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orange was . He had come over from Holland in 1688 and taken over . But it was a military dictatorship only . There was no lawful government , and many questions arose . Was the throne vacant ? Could the throne ever be vacant ? Was there a con-tract between the King and the people which James had broken ? Had he abdicated by flight , or merely deserted ? Could he be deposed by Parliament ? Arising from all this , should William become Regent , governing in the name of the absent James ? Should Mary become Queen in her own right ? Had she not , in view of the virtual demise of the Crown , in fact already become Queen ? Or should William be made sole King ; or should William and Mary reign jointly ; and if Mary died , should Anne forthwith succeed , or should William continue to reign alone as long as he lived ? Both Houses , both parties , and the Church applied themselves to these lively topics with zest and without haste. * 66 William III and Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what William decided . He was not willing to be any ruling wife 's consort ; he was not willing to step aside for her sister , if his wife predeceased him ; and in fact he would really have preferred to be king to Mary 's queen consort . It was much more tactful , however , to set up a joint reign , and there was nothing whatever for him to lose by it , for Mary was governed by him in all things . It was not ever thus . Eleven years before , Mary had married him under protest . She wept throughout the ceremony . Nobody could quite see why she minded so much . William was not handsome and he was said to be cold , hard , and stingy , but he was her own cousin , the son of her aunt , another Mary Stuart who had married another William of Orange , and anyway royal princesses might not expect to marry for love . Her uncle the king , Charles II , tried to cheer her up with a little joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' With all my worldly goods I thee endow , " several coins were spread out on the open Bible or prayer book , and the King whispered in the bride 's ear , " Gather it up and put it in your pocket while you 've got the chance . " But Mary did not think that was at all funny , and cried harder . So it was surprising when , after the wedding , Mary fell deeply and lastingly in love with her husband . He was no more attractive than he had ever been , but now everything he said she agreed with , everything he did was exactly right because he did it . When he decided to take over the throne of England , which by that time belonged to her father as King James II , she was with him heart and soul . Mary was evidently not a very sensitive young woman . Even her entourage ? usurpers too ? were shocked at her frank pleasure as she ran from room to room in Whitehall Palace , exclaiming over wellremembered things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so kind to both the little Stuart girls , had left behind in her hasty flight . Mary was not a very bright young woman , either . She would have ruled England through her husband even if he had not shared the throne with her . It was fortunate that William was very intelligent . It was perhaps not so fortunate for England that he was one of the best haters in history and that , like Richard Lion-Heart who considered England " the milch-cow of the Third Crusade , " he thought of England as a source of money and men and supplies with which to carry on his war with his enemy . William 's enemy ? now England 's ? was France . His particular , personal enemy was Louis XIV ? his first cousin once removed , and his // wife 's too . ( This relationship did not bother Mary either ; if William hated Louis that was enough for her . She would hate him too . ) He immediately moved to muster the resources of England against France . The fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryswick , and between 1702 and 1713 , when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed . In between there was an interval of uneasy peace . Several historians have compared these wars with the two World Wars in our century . They too were separated by an interval ; they too aimed at stopping the domination of Europe by one upsurging power . William III would have stopped Louis XIV more quickly and more successfully if he had not preferred to have the great Marlborough serve under lesser generals , instead of at the head of his armies ; but his reasons are understandable , and in any case the results were very good . By the Treaty of Ryswick , Louis recognized William as King of England . But then when James II died , an exile in France , Louis went to his cousin 's deathbed and recognized him again as King of England and his son as James III . This was in 1701 , and in 1702 war broke out again . Mary had died meantime . She was not much missed . She had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's adoring echo . The most strong-minded thing she ever did was collect the blue and white china which makes her remembered at Kensington Palace and Hampton Court . William was by no means an interim king while he ruled alone . He was a very forceful one . He had his limitations , his foibles , and his jealousies ( as of Marlborough ) , but he was an able man . And he really believed in his own cause . William was one of the extremely rare kings in whom personal ambition was not the motivating force ; he cared nothing for England , would have much preferred to go back to live in Holland , and stayed where he was only because he needed English resources to support the Protestant Cause . One of the attractive things about him was his affection for his wife 's nephew , the little Duke of Gloucester , Anne 's son . ( This is the child for whom the main streets in Annapolis and Williamsburg are named . ) In his portrait he looks hydrocephalic . But there was much hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1700 ( Burke says fever , others smallpox ) was a crushing blow . Two years later William died with his work unfinished . He had promoted in 1701 , after little Gloucester 's death , the Act of Settlement that would give the crown , after the death of Anne , to the Protestant 68 William III and Mary II branch of the family descended from her great-aunt , the daughter of James I. But it was all very unsatisfactory . To him , and to England . Winston Churchill puts it , as always , very well . " A queer , unnatural interlude in English history had reached its end . " * James II 1633 ? 1701 HE succeeded to the throne in 1685 , upon the death of his elder brother , Charles II . " Do n't worry , Jamie , " Charles had said to him once , when James had remonstrated about his lack of security precautions . " They 'll never kill me to make you king . " Nor did they ; and even after Charles had died in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody really believed that Charles 's son the dashing young Duke of Monmouth was legitimate ; Charles denied repeatedly the stories of a secret marriage . And Monmouth would not have made a very good king , but there were people who supported him because anyone , they felt , was better than James . James put down the Monmouth rebellion handily because he had , at the moment , the great soldier John Churchill fighting for him . Monmouth was captured and executed . But there was no great upsurging of loyalty when the crown came to rest where it belonged , on the head of King Charles I 's second surviving son . He had had , of course , a difficult childhood ? in civil war , in exile , in poverty and tragedy and uncertainty , and it affected him far more than the same things affected his very different brother Charles . Perhaps it was because he was younger ; the younger of the little French princes , Francis I 's sons , had been the one who showed the scars of their Spanish imprisonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looksblack-visaged Bourbons , both of them , and with the Bourbon sexual proclivities . And they both believed firmly in the divine right of kings . But where Charles was light-hearted and lax James was rigid and dour . Everybody liked the one ; many people respected , but hardly anybody liked , the other . Yet the war memoirs he left , written when he was a young soldier of fortune in other kings ' armies and before he felt him70 James II self burdened by the whole responsibility for the Holy Catholic Faith , show him as rather attractive ? and a good soldier , too . His mother had been strictly forbidden to bring him up a Catholic . But Queen Henrietta Maria , exiled , widowed , resigned to being a poor relation at the court of her nephew Louis XIV and never having regal power again , could not resist the chance to proselytize . She had succeeded openly with her young daughter Henrietta Anne ; rather well with her son Henry , who died , however , in the year of the Restoration ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was heir to the throne was duty bound to stay in the Anglican Church . Outwardly he did stay , and he had his daughters Mary and Anne brought up in it . But he himself was received into the Roman Catholic Church as early as 1668 or 1669 ? quietly , but it became more and more an open secret . He refused outright to take the Test Act oath , in 1673 , and his promoting King Charles 's deathbed conversion to Catholicism was boldness itself . Charles had been stricken suddenly , but he was , as he said himself , apologetically , " an unconscionable time a-dying . " James had time to make his arrangements , not only for preserving the kingdom as his brother wished , but for saving his soul . First he cleared the sickroom of all but two witnesses , and barred the door . Up the little private staircase which " Old Rowley " ( as a bawdy song called him , after a famous stud-horse ) had often found so convenient for his ladies , now came a disguised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same priest who had saved his life after the Battle of Worcester . " Now he comes to save your soul . " " He is very welcome , " Charles said weakly . And received by his own wish the rites of the Church which was his mother 's , his wife 's , his mistress Louise 's , and ( now that politics was behind him ) his own preference . But you would never get Englishmen to believe that . They preferred to call what James had done proselytizing , the taking advantage of the weakness of a dying man to force on him a conversion he did not want or intend . Arid , indeed , the way that James , now king , went about forcing the conversion of England lent support to this view . King James , greatly increasing the army , appointed Roman Catholic officers to the new regiments . Parliament , hitherto amiable , cooperative , and generous , quarreled with him over this and James prorogued it in November 1685 . It never convened again in his reign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again ; James II was making James II 7 1 precisely the same mistakes . In 1686 the judges of the King 's Bench ( James having made several replacements on it first ) ruled that the king had the power to dispense individuals from the Test Act oath . Roman Catholics were then admitted to high office again , and the King ? still , though a professed and practicing Roman Catholic , supreme governor of the Anglican Church ? suspended the less than pliable Bishop of London . All that was needed was a male heir to the throne , so that a Catholic succession could be assured . James 's two daughters by his first wife , the Earl of Clarendon 's daughter , had been brought up strictly as Protestants , and the heiress presumptive , Princess Mary , now married to Prince William of Orange who was himself fourth in line for the English throne , snubbed her father soundly when he tried to convert her . So did his younger daughter Princess Anne . But they were the last Protestant children King James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife Anne Hyde he had remarried , an Italian princess , Mary-Beatrice of Modena . She had been unlucky , so far , but she was not barren like the poor little Queen Dowager . She was pregnant again and , surely , the luck was due to change . It was confidently expected by James and those around him that the new baby would be a boy . It was indeed a boy , and it was indeed the son of King James and his young Queen . Later everyone realized and believed this . But at the time James himself did everything he could to put the issue in doubt . His procedure was unbelievably stupid , even for him . Required by law and custom to fill the delivery room with witnesses to the birth of his son , he chose Catholic witnesses . When they said they had seen a boy baby born to the Queen , Anglicans said they lied . They said a baby boy had been smuggled into the Queen 's bed in a warming-pan . James and the Roman Catholics had so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne , and the Anglicans and the friends of his daughters Mary and Anne had so much to lose , that the issue split cleanly along party lines . William of Orange , Mary 's husband , had long since been sounded out , and had indicated that he would , indeed , be available if a Protestant Champion was needed . Obviously a Protestant Champion was ? unless the Protestant heirs to the throne were to be tamely passed over in favor of this doubtfully warming-pan , but certainly Roman Catholic , baby boy . So a messenger was dispatched to William in Holland . Whigs as well as Tories , bishops as well as worldly peers , signed an invitation asking 72 . James II him to invade England , overthrow the government of James II , and ascend the throne . William accepted the invitation with the alacrity of one who has already worked out the details . In November 1688 he landed at Torbay . King James had planned to meet him on the field of battle ; he assembled a strong force at Salisbury ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , the key people he had thought were on his side began to desert him . His daughter Anne disappeared during the night . Her husband , little Est-il possible , left . The Duke of Grafton left . The Earl of Bath left . The Earl of Devonshire left . Sir Edward Seymour left . But the worst blow came with a letter from John Churchill , the Earl of Marlborough , not yet proven the greatest soldier of his time , because the big wars were still in the future , but certainly the general James had most depended upon . Marlborough , too , was casting his lot with the Protestant Champion . Marlborough , of course , was no more interested in Protestantism than were the rest of the turncoats . But he knew a rising from a setting sun . So James decided to flee instead of fight . He had been a good fighter once , when he was younger , but he too knew a rising sun when he saw one . Fleeing , he was captured by " a band of self-appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes at all . It was no part of his plan to have his wife 's father harmed physically . Permitted to escape , James could be counted on to solve the problem himself . So it was arranged for him to escape again , and this is what he did . France was the logical place for him to take refuge ; his first cousin Louis XIV , a good Catholic among other things , ruled there , and Louis was the bitter enemy of William of Orange . James 's wife and son had already made their way to France . Queen Mary of Modena had hidden behind a buttress of a parish church , waiting for dark and a small boat to take her and her baby to safety . Now James joined them there . En route in his own small boat , he dumped the Great Seal into the Thames .

Pathetically poor , burdened with responsibilities he could not fulfill , unable to trust either Anglicans or Catholics or Presbyterians , buffeted from one foreign country to another , defeated , betrayed , baffled , and unlucky , he was thirty years old before his luck changed . The comment he made when , finally , he came back to cheering , roistering , ecstatically happy London was Charles to the life .

If he rather preferred Roman Catholicism , on 74 1 Charles II the whole , it was for a very unreligious reason ? because " no creed matches so well with the absolute authority of kings .

Doctor Ken objected to having pretty , witty , but quite unrespectable Nell in his house . Another king would have got up on his high horse . Henry VIII , for instance , would have sent Doctor Ken to the Tower . Richard III would have had him beheaded on the nearest log . Charles 11 merely had other quarters found for Nell , and when the bishopric of Bath and Wells fell vacant , later , he remembered a good , conscientious Anglican who could fill it well .

Nor is the gallery of " Restoration Beauties " at Hampton Court complete . Charles had had a hard life before he came to the throne , and after he did , and Parliament granted him 1r,2oo,00o a year , he indulged himself in , among other things , all the expensive women he wanted . But though his mistresses were very expensive indeed ? Barbara , first Countess of Castlemaine and then Duchess of Cleveland , often wore jewels worth ? 40,000 , sometimes gambled away L25,000 of England 's money in one evening , and collected thousands every year from the post office , excise , and other revenues ? they emphatically did not influence him in matters of state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And though the legend persists that it was Nell Gwynn who influenced him to build the Royal Hospital ? for old soldiers ? in Chelsea , and no less an authority than Miss C.

He had seen how quickly cheering crowds could turn into murderous mobs . The happy Englishmen at his coronation would have , King Charles knew , come out as cheerfully to see him hanged . It ought to be remembered how little he was an Englishman , though England is so proud and quick to claim him , and the present Queen went back three hundred years to name her son after him .

He was a king ; his main business was kingship . His being an amateur otherwise is one of the things the English like about him , that and his casual , understated approach and his offhand brilliance which is the only kind of brilliance a gentleman should really have . His fifteen-year reign was prosperous and enjoyable ? the theater , the arts , the racetrack flourished ? but none too peaceful . The great dowry brought by his wife , the Portuguese Infanta Catherine of Braganza , opened up the horizons to English trade . She brought England Bombay , Tangier , the trading rights to China and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives the great change in English decoration , design , and tastes . A Charles II porringer , for instance , was apt to be " covered over with quaint little incised figures of a ... Chinese intention . " Silks and ivories , Chinese Chippendale and export porcelain , spices and the suddenly fashionable new drink tea ? when you think of them , think of homely , unhappy little Catherine of Braganza . Always a stranger in a strange land , outnumbered and outclassed by the " Restoration Beauties , " she brought her husband the king all this , but she brought him no child . And this he badly needed , for to think of his brother James as king after King Charles was to foresee trouble . But , true to his character and conscience , King Charles never considered repudiating his plain little Queen , and soundly snubbed the few people brave enough to suggest it . ( One courtier thought of having her kidnapped and transported to America , then divorced for desertion . ) Nor was it in character for him to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , and perhaps believe , that his mother Lucy Walters had been secretly married to King Charles . Charles loved Monmouth , loved all his illegitimate children by various mothers , but he was for the strictly regular and legal succession . This meant , unfortunately , his Catholic , tactless , and unattractive brother James , the Duke of York . He tried in every way he could to keep James 's abrasive personality from irritating the Parliament and the people , sending him out of the country at the time of the Titus Oates excitement , issuing a Declaration of InCharles II 1 77 dulgence repealing all acts against Nonconformists and Catholics including James . But Parliament rejected that and passed the Test Act instead , so that James had to resign his naval command . It was all very annoying to James , who kept on nagging his brother to be an absolute king . But King Charles was not that much of a gambler . He was not planning to risk the throne . It had been too hard to come by . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , " said King Charles . Charles I 1600 ? 1649 HE succeeded to the throne in 1625 , upon the death of his father , James I. He was a good , mild but stubborn , undistinguished young man , surprisingly short in stature . You would never have thought him the grandson of the six-foot Mary Queen of Scots and of the " long lad " Darnley she had ( perhaps therefore ) married . In every way , until it came to the very closing scenes when it was said of him that " Nothing in his life became him so well as losing it , " he seemed born to be overshadowed by somebody . First it was his elder brother Henry , who died in 1612 , clever , handsome , greatly lamented , even after death a source of unfavorable comparison with Charles . Later it would be his strong-willed French wife . Meantime it was the Duke of Buckingham . Charles had inherited the Duke of Buckingham from his father King James . James 's weakness for young men was well known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Charles needed the company and inspiration of someone more confident and dynamic than he was . Some of the things he and Buckingham did together were entirely out of character for Charles . For instance , in his father 's lifetime and with his father 's permission ( for James could refuse Buckingham nothing , and Buckingham wanted to go ) , the two young men made a trip to Spain , in disguise , so that Charles could meet the infanta there were plans for him to marry . They accomplished this Ruritanian journey in safety and the infanta was , indeed , charming ; but when Charles was romantically revealed as a prince she settled the whole affair by refusing to marry a heretic and move to a heathen land . She preferred to go into a convent , she said . So Charles returned without a bride and England 8o Charles I declared war on Spain . It had wanted to anyway , because of Spain 's invading the Protestant Palatinate . Pausing in France , though , Charles had met the young ? very young ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henrietta Maria was the daughter of the great Henry of Navarre , who had ruled as Henri IV , and of Marie de ' Medici , who now ruled France through her teen-aged son . This princess too , of course , was a Roman Catholic ? her Huguenot father had deemed " Paris worth a mass " and changed his religion to get his throne ? but the French were more reasonable than the Spanish . Henrietta Maria would have to have her own Catholic chapel and her own priests , unpopular as this would be in England , but there was no objection to her husband as a heretic or to England as a heathen land . Charles married Henrietta Maria soon after coming to the throne and they became a devoted couple , in spite of many bad auspices . The little Bourbon was always difficult ; she was subject to temper tantrums , and at times would even throw breakable things ; and she was accustomed to having her own way . She intended from the first to rule Charles . But though he was in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , because he had Buckingham for guidance ; so their married life was stormy indeed . Once after a violent quarrel he sent all her French attendants back where they came from . But then Buckingham was removed ? stabbed by an unhappy assassin named John Felton who thought he was striking a great blow for his country and would go down in history a famous man . He did indeed free his king from the domination of an arrogant , thievish , and highly incompetent favorite ; but he himself was hanged before he could also assassinate the Queen pro bono publico . For the King merely exchanged one autocratic mentor for another . Henrietta Maria openly rejoiced at Buckingham 's death . She had not been merely jealous of him ; he had had the arrogance to remind her that some queens of England , her predecessors , had got themselves beheaded . Now Buckingham himself had died violently , and she had no competition for the control of her husband the king . This was the king who thought it his duty to be " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a babe in arms himself , always . Though she became an accomplished intrigante later , Henrietta Maria , young and frivolous , was not at first interested in politics ? except , of course , as it touched her own wishes or interests . She was violently upset , for instance , when Charles broke his word ? he so often broke his Charles I 8 1 word ? about dispensing the Catholic penal laws . He had signed a document with his marriage treaty to this effect . The whole thing about Charles was that he would make a promise that seemed a good idea at the time and then , when circumstances changed , he thought that was reason enough to break the promise . He was utterly unreliable . He never kept his word in politics at all . This is hard to reconcile with his basic character , which was good and upright , except by considering how firmly he believed in the divine right of kings . God 's lieutenant , set by Him upon the throne , was obviously not bound by promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the King and his problems by our own standards and out of the context of his times and standards , that his reign should unroll like a classic tragedy . But we should consider it , of course , in seventeenth-century terms . Many people ? most people , at the outset of his reign ? also believed in the divine right of kings . It did not strain credulity any more than some of the still generally unquestioned Acts of God , like natural disasters , and it was not a disaster itself . Indeed it must have been rather comforting , to an intelligent man whose fate it was to serve a fool , to feel that this was God 's Will . Intelligent men are still serving , and serving under , or working for fools , and they have no such face-saving and ulcer-preventing conviction as this . But some of the things King Charles did , out of his well-meaning stubbornness and arrogance , were hard to take . Early in his reign he had a confrontation with Parliament , when the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed Parliament by way of stopping this . He was less successful in having Buckingham 's assassin tortured before his execution . Torture , the King had to be reminded , was now against the law . Sometimes Parliament made its point rather forcibly , the Speaker having actually been held in his chair while the Commons passed a resolution calling England 's enemies all innovators in religion and all those who levied or paid taxes not authorized by Parliament . They meant , of course , the King , who imposed taxes as he pleased , just the way his father had done . The Petition of Bight ( 1628 ) condemned martial law , billeting of soldiers , forced loans , and imprisonment without cause . Having dissolved his impudent Parliament , Charles ruled without it for eleven years , and the courts of Star Chamber and High Commission flourished , as they had in his father 's time . England was at peace with her outside enemies but not within herself . Trying to force an Anglican prayer book on the Scots ? almost anybody would have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belligerent Archbishop of Canterbury , precipitated the Bishops ' Wars of 1639-40 . Money was needed and Parliament had to be convened in the latter year . It was a disaster for Charles . He had to agree that he would not dissolve this Parliament against its will , and he could not keep it from passing the Grand Remonstrance ? a mere 201 objections to the way he , the Lord 's anointed , had been running the country . Charles could not take this , of course . Boldly going himself into the House of Commons , he tried to arrest several members of Parliament . They escaped , and he followed them into the City . He was certainly not a coward . But here he failed . He left London and gathered an army around him . England was in a state of civil war . It endured for four years . With Oxford as his capital , Charles 's Cavaliers met the Parliamentary Roundheads at Edgehill ( 1642 ) , at Marston Moor ( 1644 ) , at Naseby ( 1645 ) . At Edgehill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the charge of their tutor Dr. William Harvey to watch the battle from a safe height . It was like the First Battle of Bull Run when the congressmen and their wives and friends came out with picnic baskets to enjoy a victory and instead saw their army soundly beaten . It was fairly obvious , this soon in the King 's War , as it was called , how it was going and who would ultimately win , because the Parliamentarians had everything ? the money , the troops , the ships , and Oliver Cromwell . The King 's nephew , Prince Rupert of the Rhine , his sister Elizabeth 's son , arrived early to help and proved the most dashing of cavalry commanders , but it was not enough . Nothing was . The King 's wife , barely delivered of her last baby , escaped to France , taking a great part of the crown jewels with her ; there she put them to good use , and the generous allowance her French family made her too ; but these were not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scottish army ? his own people , and the army had been in his pay . They sold him to the English . He was a prisoner for two full years . There was only one final solution to this kind of thing . The Lancastrians had found it in the case of Richard II , the Yorkists had found it in the case of Henry VI , the Wicked Uncle in the case of the Little Princes in the Tower . Queen Elizabeth had found it in the case of Mary Queen of Scots . Oliver Cromwell found it in the case of Charles I. It is not practical to leave a nonruling ruler alive . Many of his subjects doubted , by this time , that Charles I had been King of England by divine right . But the manner of his death must have shaken even these . Every inch a king , perfectly sure that he had Charles I 83 done his duty and what was right , Charles established himself in his farce of a trial as a martyr and Cromwell as a murderer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 30 , 1649 , to show his people how a king ought to die . Jaynes I 1566 ? 1625 HE succeeded to the throne in 1603 , upon the death of his first cousin twice removed , Queen Elizabeth . When she was dying ? not before ? she had named him her successor . She hated to think of any successor at all , or of England without her . But James at least was a Protestant , and now that she had cut off the stubborn Catholic head of his mother Mary Queen of Scots he was next in line for the English throne . It was not a matter of either restitution or repentance . James I , as he became in England , was already James VI in Scotland . He was the great-grandson of that Margaret Tudor , Elizabeth 's aunt and the elder of Henry VIII 's sisters , who had married James IV of Scotland . King of Scotland he remained ; the two traditionally warring nations now had one ruler ; but he did not , as he promised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went " home " only once in twenty-two years . He was a middle-aged man when he came over to England to live , and his feelings must have been very mixed indeed . He built an impressive tomb for his predecessor in Westminster Abbey , making her share it , however , with her elder half-sister , and a separate but equal tomb for his mother Mary Queen of Scots . Her body , and presumably her head also , he had brought from Peterborough , and the effigies of the two royal ladies , the beheader Elizabeth and the beheaded Mary , lie in peaceful juxtaposition . Englishmen never knew quite what to make of James . Many of them had not expected much , but both Dissenters and Catholics had hoped that the new king , son of a Catholic mother , brought up in a Presbyterian country , might be tolerant of both their minority groups . Both were disappointed ? one to the extent of trying to blow him up . ( The 86 James I Gunpowder Plot was foiled November 5 , 1605 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-vaunted literary talents were a disappointment too , not up to the standards set in Elizabeth 's reign . In the year of his succession to the English throne a new edition of his 1597 Edinburgh publication , Daemonologie , was brought out for the edification of his new subjects ; they learned from this that their King believed in witches and in demoniacal possession and was interested in " unnatural diseases . " But he was indeed , in his peculiar way , clever . Bookish , certainly . " By nature he is a poor sleeper , " his physician 's notes say , " and often at night calls for the servant to read to him aloud . " These physician 's notes are fascinating . King James was not only interested in unnatural diseases , he had one . Without going into too many of the gruesome details ( as they do ) we should at least say that James I had , the researchers of George III 's famous madness believe , a flaming case of the " family disease , " porphyria ? was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal English line . It is conjectured that he had it from his mother Mary Queen of Scots , who was also a great invalid . He was a chronic invalid himself , certainly , all his life . He was subject to attacks of severe pain , but these did not manifest themselves except perhaps in irrationality . What did manifest themselves were some showy physical defects , decidedly unattractive ones . His tongue was too big for his mouth , so that he drooled , like a Great Dane . His legs were too weak to support his barrel-shaped body , so that even during " good " periods he had to lean on two courtiers , and in 1619 he lost the use of his legs entirely for four months , and had to be carried about " in a Neapolitan portative chair . " Later , to strengthen his legs , he bathed them " in every stag and buck 's belly on the place where he killed them . " This was no more ridiculous than many of the remedies currently prescribed , but King James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really a sick man . Not since King John , in fact , had there been an English king who had something so ludicrous about him . There was also the matter of his undignified manners . If he had not been able to write poetry , like his ancestor the other James I , King of Scotland , if he had not been master of Latin and French ( he could give the same kind of virtuoso public performances Queen Elizabeth could ) , if he had not sponsored ( and been sponsored by ) the splendid King James version of the Bible and the innovative palaces and masques of Inigo Jones , Englishmen could not have stood this newcomer . James I 87 As it was they had the greatest difficulty in standing his favorites , who were all of his own sex . Robert Can ( who succeeded Philip Herbert ) was the ruling one for eight years . Even Edward VII , whose friends went in for adultery and cheating at cards and who prostrated Queen Victoria by being called to testify in a divorce case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convicted of murdering Sir Thomas Over-bury . Can ( whom King James had created Earl of Somerset ) definitely involved him in the notorious Overbury case ; there were people then , and there are still historians now , who believe that James was actually implicated ; this belief was naturally strengthened when James pardoned his erstwhile favorite . For he had long since gone on to another one , George Villiers , the Earl , and later the Duke , of Buckingham . King James had a wife , Anne of Denmark , and a beautiful daughter Elizabeth and a promising son Henry and a delicate son Charles ; but , as he frankly said , " You may be sure that I love the Earl of Buckingham more than any one else ... . Christ had his John , I have my George . " This analogy was bad enough ; to make it worse , James , getting his saints mixed up , called his George Steenie , because he reminded him of a certain picture of St. Stephen . Nobody else could see any resemblance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money on these favorites , obviously . He was also very open-handed ? generous is hardly the word for him ? with less intimate friends and hangers-on at court . He gave presents of money , as well as titles and properties of every kind ; apparently he thought this was the only way to make his English subjects love him , and he may have been right . He also spent plenty of money on himself ? foolish though it may seem for him to have bothered with velvets and jewels when he never bothered to wash his hands . Coming from a poor , uncomfortable coun-try , he had the impression some of his " adventurers " had , when they went to Jamestown in 1607 and ( fleeing his bigotry ) to Plymouth Col-ony in 162o ? that the streets would be paved with gold . He acted as if the streets of London were . He was wildly extravagant . He also indulged the light-minded , idle Queen in her passion for the new " masques " ? expensively produced and costumed extravaganzas with scenery by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructively on a new palace for the Queen . The Queen 's House , at Greenwich , which is still one of the great London sights , was in the new classical or Italian style and it was a house , not a for-tress as palaces had always been . It revolutionized English architecture . 88 James I King James also had plans for Inigo Jones to replace the old Palace of Whitehall , now grown up into an indiscriminate cluster of buildings which did not , he thought , do him justice . Jones began with the new building we call the Banqueting House . The result of all this was James 's discovery that the streets of London were not , after all , paved with gold . He needed money . And the only way he could get it was to ask Parliament . This went against the grain , for James was an autocrat who reigned without a Parliament ( i614 ? 162r ) when it suited him . But he summoned Parliament this time because he had to have the money , and in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Parliament stronger . That body , which had not felt very powerful before , began now to realize the strength of the hand that holds the purse-strings . James also weakened the throne itself by his insistence upon its insuperable strength . Just as " It 's no good shutting your eyes and saying British is best ' three times a day after meals " ? so the present Duke of Edinburgh told an audience ? it was no good for King James to assert that " the state of the monarchy is the supremest thing on earth . " His subjects believed in the divine right of kings too , up to a point , but this was overstating it . James could have been more tactful ; but why should he , when he was answerable only to God ? He was never very curious about what was going on in his kingdom , or what people thought or felt . He imposed taxes on his own responsibility . Political prisoners were given no trial at all , just shut up in the Tower at the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Star Chamber and High Commission were in the hollow of his hand . Evidence was of less importance than the King 's wishes ? and his wishes could include the prisoner 's death . Sir Walter Raleigh was , of course , his most famous victim . This Elizabethan favorite , poet , scientist , seafarer , importer of both tobacco and the Irish potato , was no favorite of the King 's . Raleigh knew this ; it was not much less than a death-wish that brought this brilliant , morbid adventurer back to London and certain imprisonment when he could have sailed on , and on , and on . He was thirteen years in the Tower . There he had many privileges and amenities ? books , a garden , a laboratory , his family with him ? but his greatest privilege , as he saw it , was being allowed to tutor the heir to the throne . If it seems strange that a convicted " traitor " should be entrusted with this job , remember that King James I was a very strange man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Queen Anne . Perhaps she was not as light . minded and idle as she otherwise seems to be . She recognized genius James I 89 when she saw it , and she personally brought her son to the Tower to visit Raleigh . This was in 1607 or 16o8 , when Prince Henry was four-teen or fifteen years old , a highly promising boy . " He was frank , open , and manly , neither like nor liking his father , " Raleigh 's biographer says. * " No one but my father would keep such a bird in a cage , " the Prince said himself , of his new mentor . For him Raleigh wrote essays like " The Prerogatives of Parliament " and " The Cabinet Council , " and his monumental History of the World was , he says in the preface to the 1614 first edition , undertaken expressly " for the service of that in-estimable prince Henry , the successive hope ... " But in 1612 the successive hope had died . The heir to the throne became his younger brother Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a better king than his father . James I 's greatest fault as a king , the inability or unwillingness to work with Parliament , and his intolerance of the role of the House of Com-mons ? they should not even discuss " matters far above their reach and capacity , " he said ? redounded , however , to the advantage of England . It kept England out of war . War costs money , and Parliament would not vote money for so intransigent a king . So it was a peaceful reign until the breakup of the Spanish marriage negotiations , which canceled out the peace treaty of 1604 . Much may be forgiven a king who , however indirectly and for what-ever reasons , keeps his country in tranquillity . And much can be for-given a king with James 's stormy background . It is easier for us than for the Jacobeans ? Lady Raleigh , for instance ? to make allowances ; and it was not then customary to evaluate people in terms of broken homes and violent bereavements and traumatic episodes . Almost every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or assassination or beheading . James died in his bed . He is dis-tinguished for that , as for the King James version and for employing Inigo Jones and for introducing the game of golf . Elizabeth I 1533 ? 1603 HE succeeded to the throne in 1558 , upon the death of her elder half-sister , Mary I. Speaking of broken homes and violent bereavements and traumatic episodes , consider Queen Elizabeth , the most fascinating of case studies . Everyone knows her background . Tourists sigh with pleasure and relief when , in the long and obscure narrative of English history , the guide or the guidebook comes to this familiar part . Everyone knows how her father , King Henry VIII , divorced his first wife Catherine of Aragon so he could marry Elizabeth 's mother , Anne Boleyn ; how , angry because that black-eyed shrew also failed to give him a living son , he trumped up a charge of adultery against her and cut off her head ; how Elizabeth as a child was pushed from manor to castle and never knew from day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often did her father change his mind ; how following the brief security of her little half-brother 's reign she was on even shakier ground with Mary queen ; how the violently Catholic Mary actually sent her to the Tower and how only luck , and her enemies ' overplaying their hand , had kept her from being another bloody statistic ; and how she came to the throne brilliant , beautiful , victorious , happy , and glorious , long to reign , when she was only twenty-five years old . Beautiful she may not really have been , except as queens go . But she had the assurance and effect of beauty . Tall , pale , red-haired , with long , fine fingers and a fine hook to her slender nose , she was never quenched or outshone by the most fantastic and elaborate clothes a queen ever wore . That she was brilliant does not seem to be in doubt . It is hard to tell out of context , out of the framework of her own times ; girls like Elizabeth and her bluestocking cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drews to divert them , so all their read92 , Elizabeth I ing energy went into Latin and Greek and the Bible and other " improving " books . No wonder they were " learned . " Hampered by the long , stiff , complicated costumes which were replicas of adult clothes , girls even when small were channeled into the ladylike diversions of embroidery and lute-playing and stately dancing , rather than outdoor games . No wonder they were " accomplished . " And especially for girls who were princesses ( even part-time princesses like Elizabeth ) there was every incentive to apply oneself and no time to waste , for marriage would come very soon indeed . For Elizabeth it never came , and this was so unusual that she is , perhaps , more celebrated for being the Virgin Queen than for any of her other achievements . It was indeed an achievement , a continuing effort that lasted half a lifetime . Constantly there was pressure on the Queen to marry for the good of the realm , for the safety of the succession . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years past childbearing age she was flirting with this alliance or that one . The King of Spain , the Duke of Anjou , the Duke of Alencon , the Duke of Saxony , Prince Eric of Sweden , and the Archduke Charles were some of those she lingeringly considered ( or pretended to consider ) and dismissed . Queen Elizabeth remains an enigma in spite of proliferating biographies , so we are still not sure why she was both fascinated and repelled by the idea of marriage . One school of thought holds that she merely hated to give up her freedom and her identity , as indeed she would have done , to some extent , if she had submitted herself to a husband . If she knew or believed , as another school of thought has it , that she could not bear children , that would be an excellent reason . Some people said that she had a great unhealing sore on her leg , like her father 's . ( His has always been presumed syphilitic . ) Other contemporaries went further and said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable of man . " Later historians and biographers have speculated on how much she was injured emotionally by her father 's cutting off her mother 's head . That may have been her handicap , they believe , rather than any physical one . When she was young she appeared to be much in love with Lord Robert Dudley , whom she made Earl of Leicester , and preserved a great tenderness for him until he died . They were the same age and had been childhood friends . But it was an advantageous foreign marriage that was being considered for and by Elizabeth ? her dynasty needed more royal blood ? and anyway Robert was married himself , very young , to an heiress , Amy Robsart . It was one of the great scandals of Queen // Elizabeth 's reign when this inconvenient wife died by falling down a flight of stairs and breaking her neck . Did she fall or was she pushed ? It was the most famous instance of the classic question . Her husband was away at the time ? he left her often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further an ambition , to give himself a chance , perhaps , of marrying the Queen ? Or had the Queen herself ? ? It appears now that Amy Dudley 's death was no one 's fault. * But rumor and gossip would have turned to hue and cry if the Queen had married the widower . Probably she never wished to anyway . Even after she made him Earl of Leicester he was still beneath her , and Elizabeth was very conscious of her position . But she was absolutely beside herself when her Robert married , after his first wife 's death , somebody else . This was the first of the royal rages , or more plainly temper tantrums , she had over young men . All Elizabeth 's life , though she grew old and ugly , a painted , raddled old hag , there were always young men . They wrote her verses telling her how beautiful she was and perjured them-selves with professions of love and adoration ; and she rewarded them with money and titles and sinecures and fame . One after another these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Walter Raleigh , finally Leicester 's stepson the Earl of Essex , and only one of them , Raleigh , ever hated himself for it . It was simply a fact of life that buttering the old Queen was the way for a courtier to rise in the world . The Elizabeth-and-Essex business was the last romantic comedy in her life . Some historians , such as the Earl 's latest biographer , think she played it tongue-in-cheek , and certainly it contradicts her vaunted in-telligence to think she could have played it any other way . t She was in her fifties and Essex , at twenty , could have been her grandson . But they went through the high-flown , romantic routine . " Since I was first so happy as to know what love meant , I was never one day nor hour free from hope and jealousy , " Essex would write her , and " When I think how I have preferred your beauty to all things ... I wonder at myself what cause there could be to absent myself one day from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were emotional lovers ' quarrels , fre-quent and often severe . After one of them had been happily resolved the Queen gave Essex a ring of special significance . If everything else 94 Elizabeth I should fail , he should send it back to her and it would plead for him ; she would forgive him no matter what he did . But finally he did the unforgivable . He committed treason . He actually tried to " surprise the court and the Queen 's person , " planned to summon a Parliament " and alter the government . " Did he really think he could rebel against the Queen successfully in this way ? He really did . He counted on the masses of people who considered him a dashing young man ; he counted on his few drops of Plantagenet blood . But the fiasco was complete . Essex left his house with two hundred swordsmen and swaggered through the streets calling on other men to join him ; and not one single man did . The story is that from the Tower he sent his ring to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reply . But , as Elizabeth said , " I had put up with but too much disrespect to my person , but I warned him that he should not touch my sceptre . " There is a story , too , of course , that she never got the ring . Essex went to the block ; Mary Queen of Scots went to the block ; men who wrote or talked against the Queen had their right hands cut off or their tongues torn out . Elizabeth could and did take severe action . But the difference between her and some of her predecessors and some of her successors was that she minded doing it . Condemning Essex , whom she loved , brought her to the perilous edge of a nervous breakdown . Condemning Mary Queen of Scots , whom she never met in her life but who was a close relation and a queen ? to harm any royalty was to harm the mystique of royalty , and they all knew it ? was almost as devastating an experience . Queen Elizabeth had not the single-minded purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings to be mixed . She wavered , she contradicted herself , she changed her mind . She showed herself to them as a human thing , and it was one of the reasons her subjects loved her . But there were many reasons . One was that she was truly an English queen . Except for her father 's French great-grandmother 's her blood was English entirely , and she took the greatest pride in it . The speech she made as her fleet set out to catch the Spanish Armada has come down to us . Blazing with jewels , riding a spectacular white horse , she had come to Tilbury to share the fortunes of her subjects , she told them , to win or die with them as the case might be : " I know I have the body of a weak feeble woman but I have the heart and stomach of a king , and a King of England too , and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain or any prince in Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course the high point in Elizabeth 's reign . It announced to the world England 's coming of age as a world power . In the early Elizabethan years her seamen had been only im-pudent pirates and buccaneers , singeing the King of Spain 's beard over and over again and coming home with his gold , raiding not only his ships but the New World colonies which ( the Pope had said it ) be-longed only to Portugal and Spain . The current Pope had excommuni-cated Queen Elizabeth in 1570 and she was beautifully unconcerned about that , too . Early in her reign she and her great minister Cecil ( later Lord Burghley ) had settled upon a religious policy which , though satisfying neither the Roman Catholics nor the Presbyterians , worked very well for England as a whole and for its strictly secular Queen . Internal affairs remained at peace . " There was never any prince that in so long a reign was less troubled with civil dissension at home , " Clap-ham says. * Taxes were raised and raised again , for the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was no real outcry . To relieve actual destitution , Elizabeth 's reign pioneered in re-vising the Poor Laws . The great statute which passed in 16o l is substan-tially like welfare laws today ; in fact it is more intelligent in some ways , and what professionals have always considered its weak spot , its failure to respect the privacy and dignity of the poor , is coming into style again as the poor increasingly demand publicity . Children were differentiated from adults , and able-bodied adults from those physically or mentally unfit . It was a giant step forward that government now thought itself responsible , and tax money would be used , for at least the basic mainte-nance of people who could look to no one else ; and there was the corol-lary implication that their situation was not necessarily all their fault . At the same time that England was recognizing that some people would always have to be dependent on society , England was producing more vital , exuberant , achieving people than ever before . Talent and energy were in demand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the glorious age of the climber . A whole new aristocracy was springing up , looked on by the old with as jaundiced an eye as the new religionists were looked on by the old ? Roman Cath-olic ? religionists . Henry VIII , in despoiling the monasteries and making himself Supreme Head of the Church ( Queen Elizabeth thought Su-preme Governor was a better title ) , had bestowed upon upstart families some very rich properties and the wherewithal to build upon them . Secure under Elizabeth , they burgeoned out with fine , sometimes beau96 Elizabeth I tiful , and usually big new-rich houses . Houses in the form of an E , with or without the middle stem , were popular ? so popular that on into the next reign they were still being built , Hatfield House , for instance . The countryside was peaceful , so slits were out of style ; it seemed safe to experiment with large expanses of window-glass , as at Hardwick Hall . And money was no object , so gilding , painting , carving , and convoluted plastering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if a new-rich woman decked herself with every ring and brooch and necklace and bracelet she possessed . But Elizabethan women often did just that , copying the Queen who was a walking Christmas tree . And , really , the elaborate exuberance in architecture and dress suited the exuberant times . Literature was burgeoning as lushly as they . Shakespeare was not considered as preeminent then as now ; Beaumont and Fletcher , Marlowe , Jonson , Spenser , and Kyd were also of the first rank . Sir Walter Raleigh was too busy sailing his ships and spreading his cloak to have much time for writing ? that would come later , when in the Tower he undertook his History of the World ? but he and Sir Philip Sidney stood for the talented amateur who might have been in the front rank too . It was a glittering , cruel , effervescent age , and a glittering , cruel , effervescent Queen who can hardly be imagined , much less estimated , outside its context . Within it , she was a very fine one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation when she told her people , toward the end of her reign , " . . . though ye have had , and may have , many princes more mighty and wise sitting in this seat , yet you never had , or shall have , any that will be more careful and loving .... " Mary I 1516 ? 1558 SIm succeeded to the throne in 1553 , upon the death of her halfbrother , Edward VI . But it was not quite that simple . Edward had been influenced to will the crown away from both his half-sisters and leave it to his first cousin once removed , Lady Jane Grey . This was illegal ; only Parliament could change the succession ; but Edward even as a boy , even dying , was his terrible father 's son . He fixed them with a glittering eye , and the Council all signed the Letters Patent . He was quite capable of sending any of them to the block while life yet remained to him . Lady Jane Grey was the eldest daughter of the Duchess of Suffolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . She did not , frankly , have much claim to the throne . If Edward 's half-sisters were to be passed over ( and the question of their having been born out of wedlock certainly had been previously raised ) , the line of Henry VIII 's older sister , Margaret of Scotland , would have had precedence . If that line were to be passed over too ( because little Mary Queen of Scots was being brought up a Catholic ) then Lady Jane 's mother would still be the one in line for the throne , not Lady Jane . The thing was that Lady Jane was married to a son of the Duke of Northumberland , and it was Northumberland who had persuaded Edward to name her in his will . Poor Lady Jane knew she should not have the throne and she did not want it . But she was caught in the middle . She was only sixteen , a slight , pale , freckle-faced little girl with a very bright mind who had learned to obey her elders . She had been beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's son . In virtual custody out at Syon House , surrounded by her father-in-law and her own father and mother , 98 Mary I she was bullied now into a nine-days ' " reign " which ended in her imprisonment and death . So the reign of the queen who would be called Bloody Mary began with the bloodshed of this pathetic child who had not even wanted to be queen . Mary had , however , no option . What Lady Jane had done , however pushed into it by her relatives , was treason . They died for it too , and Queen Mary , the rightful heir , ascended to her throne with dignified calm . She was thirty-seven years old . She too was slight , pale , plain , and red-haired , with a very bright mind . She had had a miserable life . Her mother , whom she adored , had been put aside by the King when she herself was only fifteen , in 1531 ; and she had not been allowed to share her exile . The King specifically ordered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to say that she was always kept at court . Two years later , after the divorce and the King 's remarriage , she was indeed sent for ? but so that she could act as waiting-maid to her baby half-sister Elizabeth . Elizabeth 's mother , the usurper Anne Boleyn , hated her , of course . She behaved exactly like the wicked stepmother of Cinderella . Her own child 's legitimacy was predicated on the claim that Catherine of Aragon , the widow of his brother Arthur , had never therefore been legally married to the King ; and that meant , of course , that Mary was not legitimate . Anne Boleyn pushed this for all it was worth . But Mary was very sure that she was indeed legitimate . She knew that her mother Catherine had indeed been Queen . She knew that she was the Princess Mary , not a bastard , and from this position she did not retreat one inch . Her mother died ? not allowed to see her again ? when she was twenty , her father when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marriage for her ? not since she was young , before the question of her legitimacy had been raised . She grew into the classic image of the old maid , a stiff , sour , plain , hostile , unwanted woman . Actually she was not merely bitter but frightened and wary . At any minute something disastrous could happen , her father could turn on her even more viciously than he had before . Her stepmothers after Anne Boleyn would have liked to make things easier for her ; Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr actually did , Anne of Cleves was kind in the brief time allotted to her , even light-minded little Catherine Howard must have tried . But there was a limit to how hard anyone could press the King , and no one knew it better than his daughter Mary . When he died , and Edward VI came to the throne , Mary was still Mary I 99 wary and insecure . Her little half-brother had no hatred for her , but he was a child , under the domination of determined and unscrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no idea of letting one come to the throne . Mary 's Catholicism was the one thing nobody had been able to take away from her . Naturally she felt intensely about it . Whether she would have been a fanatical Catholic in other circumstances we do not know . Probably she would . She was after all the granddaughter of Their Most Catholic Majesties Ferdinand and Isabella , who had promoted the Spanish Inquisition and burned heretics without number in the calm certainty that they were doing it to the glory of God . This certainty was Mary 's also . Basically she was a kind rather than a vindictive woman ; she gave heretics every opportunity to recant and save themselves from the flames ; but if they stubbornly refused they left her no choice . The fires that were lighted at Smithfield burned far fewer victims than the fires in Spain and the Spanish Netherlands , but there were perhaps two hundred in three years , quite enough to fix on the English Catholic Queen the enduring name of " Bloody Mary . " Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with her burning of heretics . She married him for personal reasons . Mary had always had a tendresse for this first cousin once removed ? her mother 's greatnephew ? and in the face of much opposition from her Council and her people pushed through the marriage in the year following her accession , 1554 ? Philip for his part was polite and willing . He had already buried one wife , and , as it turned out , would bury three more . He already had an heir , if an unsatisfactory one ; with him there was no urgency , as there was with Mary at thirty-eight . He accepted with his usual grave courtesy the title of King of England ? a title which set English teeth on edge ? but he never showed any tendency to take over and to try to rule instead of or through his wife . Though he too was a firm believer in burning heretics ? he burned many in his own country ? and though the English disliked him very much , they were not unfair enough to hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact spent very little time in England . Politely , gravely , he made it plain through his actions that though he was the light and center of Mary 's life , she was only an incident in his . Nevertheless , in due course Mary 's pregnancy was announced . It came to nothing . Some subsequent authorities have thought that what seemed to be the symptoms of pregnancy were those of ovarian loo Mary I dropsy instead . There is also the possibility of tumor ? not the malignant kind that caused the Lady Flora Hastings scandal in Victoria 's reign , but a fibroid which , untreated , may later shrink away . This seems less likely , for Queen Mary had two separate and distinct " pregnancies . " And rather unlikely , too , seems the diagnosis of false pregnancy which historians so long and so confidently endorsed . There certainly is such a thing , complete with abdominal distention and even lactation , but such patients are psychotic . Queen Mary was a rather peculiar woman who had led a very peculiar life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; both for herself and for the future of her Catholic dynasty she needed a child . And her unhappiness over her husband 's long absences was intense . And both circumstances were embarrassing . But she dissembled them both . If her heart were opened after her death , she said , the word that would be found written on it was Calais . This last of England 's strongholds on the continent was lost in the year of her death ? England at war on the side of Spain against France ? and England was an island again . Edward VI 1537 ? 1553 HE succeeded to the throne in 1547 , upon the death of his father , Henry VIII . His was a short life and a short reign . Nine at his accession , he was only fifteen when he died . Most royal children who die prematurely are said to be full of promise , but Edward really was . His mother Jane Seymour 's only achievement had been to give the King a living son , but she came from a markedly intelligent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Duke of Somerset was Lord Protector for the young King , and Thomas who had quickly married the Queen Dowager , Catherine Parr ( three wives on from poor little Jane ) , unfortunately pitted their intelligence against each other , their power struggle being one of the chief features of Edward 's reign . In this they were ably seconded by their wives , the Duchess of Somerset losing no chance to try to precede and outshine and insult the Queen Dowager ( refusing to carry her train , and so on ) , and that lady , though a very nice woman indeed , refusing in her turn to be pushed around . Nor would Edward permit her to be . For five years , until her death in 1548 , when the young King was ten , she had been an admirable mother to him . Immediately after her marriage she had brought her stepchildren together with their father and given all three a pleasant home life , for the first time , under one roof . She played no favorites and , though a Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary 's religion . Her tact interposed itself between all the children and the King , whose painful leg made him increasingly violent in his tempers and whose experience with her predecessor , Catherine Howard , had left him with an even sorer wound . She made the least impression , of course , on the Princess Mary , who was in her late twenties when this latest stepmother came into the family , her unhapI o2 Edward VI piness and bitterness reflecting the ups and downs of a wretched life , her character firmly set . But the Princess Elizabeth was only ten , and though a sharp child who at the age of four had already noticed there were ups and downs in her life too ( " Why , Governor , " she tackled Sir Thomas Bryan , " how hap it yesterday Lady Princess , and today but Lady Elizabeth ? " ) was also a very affectionate one . She stayed with Queen Catherine Parr after her father 's death and even after her remar-riage to a man Elizabeth emphatically did not like . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's sixth wife had the greatest influence . Edward did not like his stepmother 's new husband very much either , though Thomas Seymour was his own uncle . When Seymour com-plained to him that the other uncle , his brother Somerset , would not let the Queen Dowager keep the jewels Henry VIII had given her on her marriage , Edward replied saying surely not , but he would attend to it , and to any future problem " I shall be a sufficient succour . . . . " And this letter , the first extant which he ever wrote all by himself ( in most of his letters , certainly the ones which have been called " priggish , " the hand is the hand of Esau but the voice is the voice of Jacob ) , he sent not to the complaining Seymour but to Catherine herself . As Edward 's biographer says , after he succeeded his father " the King was much more dependent on Catherine than he had been when his father required all her attention " as he did during his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his palaces , and he was in the habit of walking unaccompanied through galleries and ante-chambers to see her privately . " * This was truly remarkable in the light of the stiff court etiquette , which dictated , for instance , that his sisters sit on benches and cushions , not in armchairs , when they visited his apartments . " I have seen the Lady Elizabeth kneel before her brother five times before she sat down , " one foreign visitor said . Edward had come to the throne a very promising little boy , even a healthy one . Since he died young , hindsight has made him " always delicate , " but this biographer denies it . It was not until he had measles and/or smallpox in the last year of his life that his constitution was weakened , leaving him open to " consumption " and surely , from the har-rowing symptoms described , another disease as well . He had an excel-lent mind , and under the direction of highly competent tutors , Sir John Cheke and Roger Ascham , his knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emotional thing with him , was one of his intellectual interests . You will see , in the British Museum , the prayer book that Lady Jane Grey carried to the scaffold . This prayer book was a landmark of King Edward 's reign . In recent years , in their desperate flounderings to at-tract youth , Church authorities have tinkered with the Book of Com-mon Prayer ; but for over four hundred years this piece of literature has deservedly stood alongside the works of the great sixteenth-century poets and dramatists . Young Edward VI did not merely sponsor it , he was actively engaged in its composition . This sort of thing ? pomp and circumstance ? fascinated him . He himself wrote the order of service for the Knights of the Garter . Incidentally , he made three drafts , one in Latin and two in English . Latin was his second language ; he spoke as well as wrote it quickly and correctly . He wrote also ( age thirteen ) " A Discourse about the Reformation of Many Abuses , " detailing the abuses at great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured with these medicines or plasters. 1 . Good education . 2 . Devising of good laws . 3 . Executing the laws justly , with-out respect of persons . 4 . Example of rulers . 5 . Punishing of vagabonds and idle persons . 6 . Encouraging the good . 7 . Ordering well the cus-tomers. 8 . Engendering friendship in all parts of the commonwealth . " And he thought it best that all the great noblemen , " except a few that should be with me , went to their countries " ? their home counties ? " and there should see the statutes fully and duly executed . . . . " But the great noblemen continued the power game at court . In the course of it , both the King 's warring Seymour uncles lost their lives . Thomas , the Lord Admiral , caught red-handed in what must have been an attempt to kidnap the King , was executed in 1549 . The Duke of Somerset , losing his influence over Edward to the Duke of Northumber-land , was on less evidence convicted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to the execution of this uncle as well . One member of Somerset 's household burst out rashly with what many people must have thought ? then as now ? about " this unnatural nephew ? I wish I had the jerking of him , " she cried . It is hard indeed to reconcile Edward the nice little boy , the one who stopped his corona-tion procession to watch an acrobat sliding down a rope , who loved his stepmother and kept his little dog in a basket in his bedroom , with the Edward who , when he hit a target and Northumberland praised him , " Well aimed , my liege ! " answered coolly , " But you aimed 104 Edward VI better when you cut off the head of my uncle Somerset . " The thing is that Edward was not , or not merely , a nice little boy . He was a cold , intelligent , calculating Tudor . Like his half-sister Elizabeth ? like everyone ? he can not be fairly judged out of the context of his cold , intelligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have made , perhaps , the greatest of all England 's kings . Unfortunately , he died young . Henry VIII 1491 ? 1547 HE succeeded to the throne in 1509 , upon the death of his father Henry VII . The death of his elder brother , Prince Arthur , had made him the heir apparent . And thereby hangs the tale . Like Charles II , who is chiefly remembered for his mistresses when much about him , very worthy of mention , is forgotten , Henry VIII is chiefly remembered for his wives . The first wife was his brother Arthur 's widow , Catherine of Aragon . Though she was a very Spanish princess , the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella , it must be remembered also that she had English blood . Her mother was a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt , Edward III 's son , and it was from this branch of the family that Catherine , usually depicted on stage and screen as very dark , with flashing black eyes , inherited the china-blue eyes and reddish-blond hair that made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless as a stranger and a foreigner , learning English with a strong accent which she never lost , and when her young husband soon died her position was uncomfortable and unhappy . Shunted to one side , she was treated very badly by her penurious father-in-law , who kept her in England only because he could not bear to send back her dowry ? not that all of it had been paid ; her own father was penurious too . The theory was that she would be married next to the next heir to the throne , young Prince Henry , but nothing happened . Years passed , and Catherine was bitterly poor , bitterly humiliated , and desperate . From this situation she was rescued by a kind , handsome young man , and she never ceased to be grateful to him . Ascending the throne at seventeen , Henry VIII made it one of his first acts to marry his brother 's widow . io6 Henry VIII With her he lived happily enough for ten or fifteen years . He was not altogether faithful , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or tried to bear , him many children . Unfortunately , sometimes she miscarried and sometimes her babies died at birth or in infancy . Only one , the Princess Mary , survived . She was given the title of Princess of Wales . By the time Mary was eight years old the King seems to have de-spaired of Catherine 's giving him a male heir . He hurt her feelings then by bringing to court his strong , beautiful , six-year-old illegitimate son Henry Fitzroy , creating him Duke of Richmond amid great pomp and circumstance . The fact that Richmond had been King Henry 's own title , when he was a cadet , and also that of his father before Bosworth Field , did not escape notice ; but in every way he treated little Richmond like an heir . This was bluster , though . The Tudor dynasty was not so firmly seated that Henry could expect an illegitimate successor to be well re-ceived ? or accepted at all . Similarly , he knew there would be no ready acceptance for a girl , even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legitimate heir ? In his desperation , this thought oc-curred to the King . There was a passage in the Bible ? in Leviticus ? that specifically for-bade marrying one 's brother 's widow.t To take the curse off this , there had been a dispensation from the Pope ( Julius II , then ) at the time Henry had married Catherine . But was the curse really off ? Apparently not ? though Leviticus did say " they shall be childless , " and Henry and Catherine did have children , one of whom , Princess Mary , was still living . Having a child who was only a girl was , however , practically the same as having no child at all . Henry was a very religious young man , and his conscience began to hurt him badly . By a strange coincidence , there had appeared at court a black-eyed maid of honor named Anne Boleyn . She was twenty-two years younger than Queen Catherine ( at forty-one , approaching the end of her dynastic potentialities ) , and though she was not beautiful she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the King 's // mistress , and anyway what he needed was not another mistress but an-other wife . One who would give him a legitimate son . This was in 1526 . Within a year after he first noticed Anne , Henry had set in motion " the King 's great matter , " the divorce from Catherine which would overturn his English and Roman Catholic world . But it was a long and bitter business . Catherine fought him every step of the way . He sent an emissary to the Pope , but the Pope ( Clem-ent VII , by now ) had Catherine 's side of the story too . And Catherine was the aunt of Emperor Charles V , who had held the Pope as prisoner since the sack of Rome in 1527 . Obviously Clement , " cowering in Cas-tel ' Sant ' Angelo , " * needed the goodwill of the Emperor more than he needed the goodwill of the King of faraway England . Back to England , therefore , the emissary came with a noncommittal , worthless document . Two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the promise that a papal legate , Cardinal Campeggio , would come to England and join Cardinal Wolsey , the English primate , in a court hearing touching a divorce . But many months passed before he procrastinatingly got there , and when he did , Catherine , called into court , beat Henry at his own game . This was in 1529 . Speaking eloquently in her Spanish accent , she appealed directly to the King . She challenged him to deny that she had been still a virgin at her second marriage . This was a debatable point ; Catherine and fifteen-year-old Prince Arthur had occupied the same bedroom for several months , and many people thought it logical that the first marriage had indeed been consummated ; but it was hard to disbelieve what the Queen was saying , and the King himself was visibly abashed . Catherine finished , curtsied , swept out of court , and refused to return . The court adjourned without a decison . Cardinal Wolsey , under pres-sure from Henry to act without Cardinal Campeggio and defy Rome , under pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic now because of his slowness , was suddenly stripped of his offices and riches . He would have gone to the Tower if he had not opportunely died . Better men than he did go to the Tower because they would not rubberstamp Anne Boleyn as the mother of lawful heirs , and later Sir Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher were beheaded for it . Six years had passed . Six years ! Incredibly , Henry , whose attention span had been short before , never ceased to want his Anne . Cleverly , Anne kept him on the string . But she knew , too , when the string was io8 Henry VIII about played out . When she became pregnant , the new Archbishop of Canterbury , the King 's faithful man Thomas Cranmer who had re-placed Wolsey , by his legal authority divorced Queen Catherine ( now called the Princess Dowager ) from King Henry VIII . For some reason Henry and Anne 's secret ceremony of marriage was not publicly repeated . But in May 1533 there was a ceremony of coro-nation for Queen Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was not the longed-for boy . It was a girl , Princess Elizabeth . She was the only royal princess , for of course the Princess Mary was a bastard now . And , since Richmond had always been a bastard , she remained the only royal child of either sex . Eventually there was a still-born boy , but this time the blame could not be laid upon Leviticus . And even before this the King had begun to notice Jane Seymour . It was history repeating itself , because Jane like Anne before her was a maid of honor to the Queen . And it was history repeating itself that there were no real grounds for divorce ? much less for execution . Of course Anne was not the model of circumspection Catherine had been , and undoubtedly she batted her eyes at this or that young man , and it was a well-known fact that she had once wanted to marry young Thomas Percy . But that was long before her marriage to the King , and there was no shred of evidence that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musician Mark Smeaton ? or with Henry Norris or Francis Weston or William Brereton ? or with her own brother George . This charge of incest was based solely on her having spent several hours with her brother alone . The King 's men , making up their case against the Queen , did not do things by halves . All five of the routinely convicted young men were beheaded under Anne 's window , where she was imprisoned in the Tower . The next day she herself was beheaded on Tower Green . One biographer ( Henry VIII 's dazzling Hackett ) points out that legally as well as ethically there was a flaw in the proceedings . Two days after her trial the Archbishop of Canterbury ( the same unholy man , Cranmer , who had declared Queen Catherine 's marriage null and void ) proclaimed Queen Anne 's marriage null and void also . If she had never been married to the King , as Cranmer now ruled , she could never have cuckolded him . This is true . The point is well taken . But Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an incestuous relationship with her brother , which had no bearing on whether or not she was legally married to the King , and of plotting the King 's death , which also had no bearing . So she was executed quite legally , if most disgracefully. // And the King 's second daughter , in her turn , was demoted from princess to bastard . The King waited until he heard the cannon fired on Tower Green . At nine o'clock in the morning , May 19 , 1536 , the sound came . Anne Boleyn was dead . Her widower set out promptly on a now familiar trip ? down river to Jane Seymour 's father 's house . He married her there next day . Queen Jane , undoubtedly much prettier than her Holbein portrait , made Henry an excellent wife . She produced promptly , but not too promptly , the wanted heir . Then she died " of childbed fever , Before her looks or his heart could leave her . " Little Prince Edward was a sturdy , handsome child . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Nobody planned only one . A Duke of York , to make the succession doubly sure , was needed too . But succession or not , King Henry was not especially eager to remarry this time . The loss of good little Jane had been sobering . He would never forget her , and when he died he would be buried by her . The wife who followed this perfect wife might have suffered the comparison in any case . But Anne of Cleves , the sister of a powerful Flemish duke , was hardly Henry 's type . A mail-order bride , she had been accepted on the strength of her portrait by Holbein . Most female Holbeins are , to say the least , understated , but this one flattered Anne of Cleves . Henry simply could not " stomach " her ; she was , he went on to say , " a great Flanders mare " ? and if you go to the Low Countries today you can see exactly what he meant . There are painfully few pretty women , and even those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a handsome horse ? thick , sturdy bodies , utilitarian legs . Henry liked racehorses , and he frankly and simply refused to live with Anne of Cleves . Anne of Cleves did not seem to mind . She was as stolid as she looked . Her proxy marriage had had no emotional impact , and though she did not want to go back to Cleves , she was very willing to be bought off with a nice castle ( Hever Castle , Anne Boleyn 's family 's seat , which seems unnecessarily crude ) , plenty of money , plenty of obeisances , and the title of " the King 's good sister . " She was the luckiest of all Henry VIII 's wives . Henry chose his next wife himself , not from a picture . There was a charming little girl at court named Catherine Howard . She was a first cousin of Anne Boleyn , which like Hever Castle would have bothered a more sensitive man , and there was nothing whatever to be said for her ho Henry VIII except that she was young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically brainless , had been badly brought up , and had a repu-tation for lightness and laxity which nobody dared to mention to the King . He found out about it later . He also learned that , in addition to the several young men ( one in particular ) whom she had " lain with " be-fore her marriage , there were several young men ( one in particular ) who were still admitted to her room when everything was quiet , and either the King was away or Catherine herself was on a " progress . " This had required the connivance of her lady-in-waiting , so Lady Rock-ford was sentenced to be beheaded too . Her name is on the marker on Tower Green along with Queen Catherine Howard 's . On the block , Catherine said , hysterically , " I die a Queen , but I would rather die the wife of Culpepper . " Culpepper was the young man ? he was executed too , after torture at Tyburn ? whom she had loved both before and after her marriage to the King . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Catherine told the little crowd around the scaffold , " that long before the King took me , I loved Culpepper and ... he urged me to say that I was pledged to him . . . but sin blinded me and greed of grandeur . . . . Pray hasten with thy office , " she said to the executioner . " Good people , I beg you pray for me . " King Henry was never the same after Catherine Howard . He had really believed her what he called her , his " rose without a thorn . " As if he had never seen in the mirror the enormously gross , diseased , preda-tory monster of his later portraits , he really believed that this beautiful young girl had married him for love . His Council , spreading the evi-dence of her infidelity before him , had been shocked and abashed by his tears . But the King 's resilience was one of the remarkable things about him . His eye fell on Catherine Parr . This lady , who would become the sixth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsion to marry and remarry that he did . Though only thirty when she came to his attention , she had already been widowed twice , and she would marry again ( very promptly ) when he died . After his sensational previous marriages ? imagine the talk in the courts of Europe ? the happy marriage Henry had with this serene and pleasant woman was anticlimax . Other things besides his personal life had Henry 's attention during his thirty-eight-year reign . But the very nature of his reign was shaped by his famous divorce . It changed England 's economic , political , and social structure as well as its religion . Henry VIII I I I When he was younger Henry had been a truly dutiful son of Mother Church . He more than his people , more even than some of his clerics , was inclined to make very sweeping statements about the power and authority of the Papacy . Sir Thomas More , of all people , thought the King was overstating it when he said , ' We will set forth that authority to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial . " But when the matter of his own divorce came up it was easy for Henry to see that the Pope was not judging his case on its merits . He knew the Pope was not inexorably opposed to divorce , having just ( 1527 ) granted one to Henry 's sister Margaret in Scotland . And he knew the situation of the Pope , actually the prisoner of Queen Catherine 's own nephew . His break with Rome over this personal matter was much more of an emotional thing for England 's King than it was for England . England was pious enough but not , on the whole , fervently religious . England did not altogether like its clerics , their rapacity , their conduct , or their numerosity . In Henry VIII 's time there were ten thousand people in York , for instance , and five hundred clergy to " serve " them . In practice it turned out that the people were serving the clergy , who in such numbers were burdensome to support . Some of the clergy lived high , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unadmirable . Royalty was expected to make a show , but houses like Wolsey 's Hampton Court were nobody 's idea of how men of God should indulge themselves . Also it seemed to the English ridiculous that they should have to seek permission for this and that from a Pope who was a stranger in a far-off land , waiting for months and perhaps years for his answer and then finding that he had not really comprehended the distant circumstances on which he had based it . This last objection was a matter of national temperament . The English have an independent habit of thought . In I765 Englishmen would object , again , to being told by someone many miles and weeks away how to regulate their local affairs . So while there will always be people to say that Henry VIII 's divorce caused the English Church to splinter off from Rome , it seems more reasonable that the divorce was the impetus , not the cause . It was like a personal tragedy that " causes " a person to lose his mind ; this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark that sets off dynamite already piled up and waiting . The consequences of Henry 's break with Rome were tremendous . First , the power and importance of the sovereign were increased . He 112 Henry VIII was responsible now to no one . He himself was the Head of the Church as well as State . Also , he had much more wealth at his disposal . The rich trappings and appurtenances of the old religion ? the gold altar vessels , the silver reliquaries and statues ? could now be melted down and the jewels picked out . The wide monastery lands were now royal lands . The King kept some of the property he confiscated ? the London parks , for instance , are old monastery acreage ? but much of it went cheaply , or as outright gifts , to the King 's friends and supporters . Such tourist attractions as Woburn Abbey , which went to an ancestor of the Duke of Bedford , and Newstead Abbey , which went to an ancestor of Lord Byron , still reflect their origin in their names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived among pointed arches and flying buttresses . Sometimes they tore the abbeys entirely down and used the materials for domestic architecture . The old Establishment , the old nobility , looked on glumly ? and helplessly . Some of them still kept their old religion and rode out the storm ; but they did it quietly . The noise you heard all over England was the new landed gentry celebrating . It was rather like our twentieth century , when the saying is that the English gentry are no longer landed and the present landholders are certainly not gentry . But in the sixteenth century they became a very reasonable facsimile . They learned fast . What are now the fine old families of England were hard-headed career people and social climbers , who with their new lands , their new money , and often their new titles soon acquired the habit of command . They acquired Oxford and Cambridge educations for their sons . They learned the ways of the court , but they learned also that it is good to keep one foot on the land . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew more about the facts of life than the old entrenched Catholic nobility and gentry had known . They were the King 's men for life , and on down from father to son . In giving his friends and supporters the confiscated monastery lands , the King had gained even more committed friends and supporters . Without divesting themselves of their new possessions , these men could never turn back , could never decide to return to the old religion , decide that the Pope was , after all , the true Head of the Church and holder of the only keys to heaven , decide that the King 's divorce was therefore worthless . Henry 's dynasty was assured of the future , as well as the present , backing of this whole new powerful block . To be on the safe side , however , the King proceeded to wipe out any // remaining Plantagenets whom any disaffected old families might be tempted to get behind . He even beheaded the poor old Countess of Salisbury , Margaret Pole , who in her seventies was likely neither to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He also cut down some of the more powerful or popular old nobility . The Earl of Surrey , the Duke of Norfolk 's son , was beheaded ; Norfolk himself was saved only by the King 's death the day before the day appointed for his own . Enemies as well as fancied enemies , whole towns as well as individuals , were dealt with savagely . The commander of the King 's army invading Scotland ( 1544 ) was ordered to " sack Leith and burn and subvert it and all the rest , putting man woman and child to fire and sword , without exception . . . turn upside down the Cardinal 's town of St. Andrews , as the upper stone may be the nether , and not one stick stand by another , sparing no creature alive within the same . . . . " It sounds very modern ; more properly it was timeless ; it was simply war . But the King Henry who gave these orders had come a long way . He was changed as much as he had changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kind , gay , studious young one who had married the first Catherine . This enormous , repulsive , bloated hulk could not be the beautiful , spectacular athlete his oldest subjects remembered ? " St. George in person , " someone had said , watching him jousting in a tournament . For some time it had been necessary to get him up and down the stairs with a " hoisting device . " His leg was a solid flaming sore . It was the unbearable pain in his leg that caused the blackfaced , murderous rages ; his court knew that , tried to believe that . But it was awful to see him , in the last few days , trying to sign the old Duke of Norfolk 's death-warrant . He could not do it . He simply could not move his hand . 1 lB ascended the throne in 1485 , having defeated and killed King Richard III in battle at Bosworth Field . Kings wore their crowns into battle in those days , and when Richard was killed the crown of England fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new King was crowned then and there ? Henry , by the grace of God .. . God that day was on the side of the strongest battalions . Henry VII had a family claim to the throne too , but of itself it would not have put him there . He was the **26;427;TOOLONG of Edward III . Six generations removed ? more than a hundred years since Edward III had sat on the English throne ; ' and not only was Henry 's a female line of descent , it was a born-out-of-wedlock line . It was true that his great-great-grandfather ( John of Gaunt ) had belatedly married his mistress and Parliament had legitimated all the children ; but at the same time Parliament had expressly excluded them and their descendants from inheriting the throne . Also , there were eight or ten people ? literally ? who had much better claims than Henry . One was the Princess Elizabeth of York , the eldest daughter of Edward IV , the sister of the Little Princes of the Tower , and the niece of the Richard III dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that took care of that . Elizabeth 's motivations and sentiments are not recorded . Another person with a good claim to the throne ( assuming a woman was not acceptable ) was the Earl of Warwick , Edward Plantagenet . King Henry had him imprisoned and finally executed . There remained other persons with claims ( all better than the new King 's ) , but Henry had made his point at Bosworth Field and they did not trouble him . He did have trouble with various imposters ; Lambert 1 16 Henry VII Simnel appeared promptly after his coronation , and there were several other " feigned boys " ; but after he hanged Perkin Warbeck the pretenders got the point too . Henry settled down then to make England a very good king indeed . He had wanted the throne and ? this is not always the case ? knew exactly what to do with it when he got it . He was a cautious , prudent , constructive man ? the circumstances of his accession make him sound dashing , but he was not ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent businessman would . Its finances were his first concern . He was a penny-watching , pound-pinching sovereign . Some contemporaries and historians have sneered at him for this but it was exactly what England needed . The country was heavily in debt . In very few years Henry got it out . He doubled the revenues from crown lands and customs and tripled his own . Soon he was saving money and was able to buy ? as an investment , of course , not to indulge himself or anybody else ? over ? 1oo,000 worth of jewels . Some of his business practices were commendably sound , some merely sharp , but they all contributed toward making England solvent and the King rich . Henry encouraged trade , taking a cut . An absolutely great taxcollector , he believed in strict courts to back him up . They soon became strict in every way , and his Star Chamber ? part of his Council sitting as a court ? was hated and feared and respected . People were fined for some very strange things , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-mighty subject , " and one may imagine the Earl of Oxford 's rage when , after entertaining the King , he was fined ? 1o,000 for doing the thing too splendidly . Another way the King helped the economy was by staying out of war . In the matter of courage as well as ancestry , he had made his point at Bosworth Field . Nobody accused him of cowardice because he stayed at home and built up his country . When it was absolutely necessary to fight ? the Scots along the border were troublesome ? he did it on half the money that had been voted for his military expenses , and pocketed the rest . But his finest hour came when ( 1492 ) he got money from Parliament to fight France and then not only did not fight France at all but blackmailed the French king into paying him not to . He was too clever by half , as the English say . But he knew how to get along in the world . He was a wise and far-seeing executive . With solvency he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and in this atmosphere the arts and trades and crafts flourished . Henry VII z z 7 He also was carefully building up his dynasty , the great Tudor dynasty , making his bricks with a minimum of straw . Tudor was a Welsh name , virtually unknown in England . ( It was not even very important in Wales . ) Henry 's father , Edmund Tudor , whom Henry VI had created Earl of Richmond , had married Lady Margaret Beaufort , and Beaufort was the family name of the out-ofwedlock pseudo-Plantagenets whom Parliament had legitimated but expressly excluded from the succession . This line was Henry VIPs only shadow of a claim to the English throne . He did have another royal line , but it was French , not English . Edmund Tudor 's father , Owen Tudor , had married the Queen Dowager of England , the widow of Henry V. She had been born a Valois , the French King Charles VI 's daughter . So King Henry VII of England , the first royal Tudor , was King Charles of France 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King of England , Henry VI , who had been the son of Henry V and Catherine of Valois . His father was , as contemporary genealogists delicately put it , uterine brother to Henry VI ? half-brother on the mother 's side . This was why , of course , Henry VI had made Edmund Tudor Earl of Richmond . All this was irrelevant and immaterial , in a way , because it certainly had no bearing on Henry VIPs claim to the English throne . As to that , the Beaufort line was all he had . But by crediting him with more royal blood it did take some of the curse off the upstart Tudor blood . It gave him dignity and prestige . The Tudors claimed to be descended from King Arthur , though , and King Henry and Queen Elizabeth emphasized this creditable connection by giving his name to their oldest son and heir . Prince Arthur 's death , at fifteen , affords us one of few glimpses into his parents ' relationship . It could have been anything , for obviously they had married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen when Arthur died , and part of what she said , comforting in her turn , was written down . She reminded him " that God had left him yet a fair Prince , two fair Princesses , and that God is where He was , and that we are both young enough . " If that was her philosophy , " that God is where he was , " Elizabeth of York had remarkably surmounted a tragic early life . She looks , indeed , beautifully serene as she lies in bronze beside her husband , in the Henry VII Chapel which he soon built in Westminster Abbey to receive her body . She proved not , after all , young enough to recover from bearing another child . Many historians have thought that her widower 's promptness in putting himself back into matrimonial circulation , very soon after Elizabeth 118 Henry VII died , showed he cared nothing about her . But this is not true . It is not necessarily true even of a private citizen , and in Henry VII 's case it was a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he intended to use young Henry and Margaret and Mary , to strengthen his Tudor dynasty by useful foreign alliances ; being now available , he would use himself too . But fortunately his plans came to nothing ? fortunately , because the queen he really wanted to marry , the greatest heiress in Europe , Joanna of Castile , was quite insane . Crazy Jane ? the name still survives . Passionately in love with her handsome , unfaithful husband , Philip of Austria , Joanna had never recovered from his death . ( Here is a prime example of a personal tragedy that was a trigger rather than a cause . Insanity ran ? galloped ? in Joanna 's family . ) For a long time King Henry persisted , his mouth still watering for " la Loca " ' s money , that a kind new husband was all she needed to make her well again ; but even he wavered from his purpose when he realized that Queen Joanna really would not be separated from the embalmed body of her first husband , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . So Henry VII died still a widower . But Joanna was just about the only opportunity to enrich and establish England that he had let go by , and his imprint would be on England always . Study if you can the face of Henry VII ? not the stylized bronze on his beautiful tomb , or the young picture holding the gillyflower , or the older picture with the Tudor rose . In the crypt of Westminster Abbey is the effigy that was carried in his funeral procession , made unquestionably from his death-mask . Look at this . You are looking at England 's first modem king . Richard III 1452 ? 1485 Hu usurped the throne in 1483 , upon the death of his elder brother , Edward IV , and the mysterious disappearance of Edward 's two little boys . Yes , these were the Little Princes of the Tower , and Richard III , formerly Richard Duke of Gloucester , was the Wicked Uncle of history and legend . He was the last member of the Plantagenet family to reign in England , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to be tall , blond , godlike , with blazing blue eyes ; Richard was small , dark , unprepossessing . He may or may not have been slightly deformed , with one shoulder higher than the other ; the controversy which rages over his character extends to this physical " flaw . Shakespeare , of course , is played with Richard looking like the Hunchback of Notre Dame and exuding waves of pure evil , but historically one must pay no attention to Shakespeare . Unfortunately the so-called serious historians have written less than objectively , too , the earlier ones as Tudor propagandists , some later ones as zealous unblackeners of Richard III . Did Richard III really have the Little Princes in the Tower , his nephews , put to death ? Everyone will have to make up his own mind . King Edward IV , his elder brother , left seven children , all technically capable of inheriting the throne , though five of them were girls . There was no law in England forbidding female succession . But it was one of those theoretical female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for all practical purposes the heirs to the throne were Edward 's two boys . The elder , Edward also , automatically became Edward V. The younger , Richard the Duke of York , automatically became next in line . The new King , aged twelve , had as Prince of Wales been living in Ludlow Castle up near the Welsh border . Some of his mother 's rel-
