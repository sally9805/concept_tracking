The city of Juneau ( pop . 6,050 ) has been the capital of Alaska since 1900 , and its site in the Panhandle of the state made it one of the Alaskan cities closest to the lower 48 states . But the modern era has made Juneau 's once enviable position uncomfortably awkward . <P> Most of the 300,000 Alaskans now live in the northern portion of the state , the bulk of them around the two largest cities , Anchorage and Fairbanks . What is more , Juneau remains inaccessible over land to the rest of the state-it can only be reached by plane or boat . <P> If that were not enough , it is a full two time zones away from the area of the state where most of the population lives . Twice , in 1960 and 1962 , an initiative has been offered to the voters to move the capital farther north , and both times it was rejected . But last week Alaskans , by a vote of 40,865 to 29,429 , decided that the time had come to change capitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site can not be closer than 30 miles to either Anchorage ( pop . 48,029 ) or Fairbanks ( pop . 14,771 ) and will have to be carved out of the wilderness between those two cities . Governor William A. Egan will now appoint a commission to propose sites , and its three likeliest choices will be put before the voters in 1976 . Among the more exotic possibilities already suggested are Nenana , Talkeenta and Wasilla . Whatever the electorate 's decision , the new capital will bring up to date the state motto : " North to the Future . "
