" All men are equal before God , but all men are not equal before men because the differences are obvious . " <P> So says James Thomas Kruger , South Africa 's Minister of Justice , Police and Prisons , and thus the man in charge of trying to control the rioting that is racking the nation . He has strong opinions on the cause of that rioting . Blaming it on " the black-power movement based in America , " he recently told a friendly audience of National Party followers in his native Orange Free State : " They sing We Shall Overcome . Well , they are wrong . We shall overcome . . . The black knows his place , and if not , I 'll tell him his place . " Several days later , after his words had been widely quoted , Kruger complained that there had been a misunderstanding . What he had said , Kruger claimed , was that there were " people seeking confrontation , and they will be put in their place . " <P> A deceptively cherubic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puritan , the product of a farming family and a correspondence-course college education . As Justice Minister , he seems to enjoy the diversion of cracking down on Sunday movies , which are technically illegal under South Africa 's blue laws . Himself the father of two sons ( his wife Susanna is the author of a book of essays ) , he often speaks of his country 's race problems in unabashedly paternalistic tones . " Anarchy-that 's what the children of Soweto want , " he told a local newspaper . " And if their parents ca n't control them , I will . " <P> Kruger has from time to time advocated a new deal for his country 's African population and has helped to desegregate some of the country 's best hotels and restaurants . He is far better known , however , for his kragdadigheid ( iron-fistedness ) . He has defended the actions of his police to the hilt , declaring them to be " in the forefront of the fight to combat Communism which is infiltrating the country . " Asked why the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soweto in which 176 were killed , Kruger replied : " Rubber bullets give the impression the police have rubber guns . They can not protect life and property with rubber guns , and I have no intention of asking them to do so . " <P> In May , Kruger guided through Parliament an omnibus security bill , known as the Internal Security Act , that provides for the indefinite detention without trial of any person whom the police deem to be a security risk . As his police continued a nationwide crackdown on black militants last week , Kruger confirmed that 77 people were being detained under the Internal Security Act ; some sources say that the number is at least twice as high . The minister added that 744 others , most of them black , had been arrested on such charges as rioting , arson and " causing a disturbance . " <P> One of Kruger 's complaints about South African society today is that the English-language press is too free . He advocates a law that would prevent publication of the names of people detained without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kruger 's proposal , they fear , could transform South Africa from a police state into a secret police state .
