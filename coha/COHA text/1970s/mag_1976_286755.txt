Teddy DeVita , 13 , seems like a normal teenager . Darkly handsome with brown hair and twinkling eyes , he sings folk songs , plays the guitar , performs card tricks and is fascinated by the Old West . But Teddy is no ordinary youngster . His world consists largely of a small ( 8% ft. by 10 ft. ) , near-sterile chamber at the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) in Bethesda , Md. , where he has lived in isolation for the past 31/2 years . <P> The youngster is the victim of severe aplastic anemia , a rare , puzzling disease in which the bone marrow loses its ability to produce three essential components of blood : the white cells that fight infection , the red cells that transport oxygen to the tissues , and platelets for clotting . Only by confining Teddy to the superclean room and giving him repeated transfusions have doctors managed to keep him alive . <P> Teddy 's living quarters-one of eight " laminar air flow rooms " set up by the NCI for infection-prone patients - is kept free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces clean air into the room through filters and out through an open doorway ; germs can not make their way past the outward-flowing air . Only people dressed in specially designed sterile outfits are allowed into the room . <P> The young patient talks to his visitors-including his parents and a teacher who comes to help him with school-work every afternoon-through the open doorway or a transparent plastic barrier ; this wall has two sleeve-and-glove arrangements that allow people to reach into the room and play checkers or cards with Teddy without contaminating him . Books , magazines and games-sterilized by steam or gases - are passed into the room through the doorway . Food , too , must be specially prepared . Even Teddy 's favorite fare , pizza , is so thoroughly baked that it is practically unrecognizable . <P> Aplastic anemia strikes about 1,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills 50% to 80% of them within a matter of months . Doctors do not know the ailment 's causes ; genetic factors , radiation , viruses and such chemicals as benzines have all been implicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone marrow suddenly-and mysteriously-begins working again . Teddy , who is the son of a prominent cancer specialist , Dr. Vincent DeVita Jr. , director of the division of cancer treatment at NCI , has shown little improvement . His marrow remains almost as inactive today as it was on Sept. 15 , 1972 , when he first entered his cubicle .
