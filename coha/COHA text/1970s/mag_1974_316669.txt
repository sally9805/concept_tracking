After a dozen highly publicized " summit " meetings , innumerable agitated sessions with his official advisers and countless private talks with old friends , President Ford said that he was ready at last to " bite the bullet " on the economy . But the program that he presented last week to a nationally televised joint session of Congress was more balm than bite , and not a great deal of either . <P> The basic policy was essentially unchanged from that which Ford inherited from Richard Nixon last August-a federal budget with spending held at or below $300 billion and a fairly tight monetary policy . <P> To his credit , the President did not try to deal with the economy 's incredibly complex problems in a demagogic fashion by promising simple solutions where none exist . As expected ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) , he called on Congress to pass a modest 5% tax surcharge on some individuals and all corporations , and he asked for additional tax credits to stimulate investment and industrial expansion . But there was much less tax relief for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative instincts , he turned aside insistent advice for direct Government intervention and appealed instead for voluntary action to cut demand-and prices-for food and fuel . <P> Recruiting Effort . " Grow more and waste less , " he urged . " Drive less , heat less . " Wearing a red-and-white lapel button reading " WIN " - for Whip Inflation Now-he called " upon every American to join in this massive mobilization and stick with it until we do win as a nation and as a people . " At White House request , newspapers the next day printed an enlistment form for " inflation fighters " ; the first 100,000 people to fill out the form and mail it to the White House will get a free WIN button . <P> At every turn , Ford found himself fighting a two-front war . Clamping down hard to restrain the inflation threatening the financial fabric of the nation could tip the economy into a deep recession . <P> Doing battle with the recession that now grips the nation could doom the fight against inflation . A gasoline tax could limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the tax would boost retail prices and make inflation even worse . <P> Curtailing oil imports directly by imposing quotas would help pressure the oil-exporting nations to lower their prices , but that move could also send economic activity downward . <P> Congress , which had welcomed the President warmly to the House chamber he knows so well , greeted his proposals with a cool skepticism . Legislators wondered if the suggestions , in the eyes of the American people , would constitute much of the " leadership " and " action " that the President rightly said they yearn for . Even within the Administration , some officials found it hard to muster more than faint praise for the end product of so much public and private soul searching . Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns , who favored more wage-price jawboning and a bigger public service employment program than Ford proposed , said , " It is a well-balanced program . Whether it goes far enough as a whole or in individual directions is a complicated question that members of Congress may well answer differently . But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
