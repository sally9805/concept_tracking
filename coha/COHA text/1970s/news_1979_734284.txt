txt Take coal , America 's most abundant fossil fuel , and put it at the focus of a solar furnace . Add steam and , behold , you have a gaseous fuel that may be upgraded to pipeline quality or converted into a liquid fuel to replace oil . This fundamentally new approach to America 's energy woes was first successfully tested last month by scientist David W. Gregg of Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California . The test was made at White Sands , New Mexico . Dr. Gregg 's experiment does not mean a cheap replacement for current fuels . Although solar coal gasification may have a promising future , all forms of such gasification and liquefaction are much costlier than current prices for natural gas and oil . Still , the novelty in his method comes from combining coal and solar technologies . Up to now , these have been pursued independently . In fact , at the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) and elsewhere , a great deal of hostility has sprung up between technologists of the two camps . Conventional coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat needed to turn into gas . In the Gregg process , not only is this percentage saved but the process actually converts solar energy into chemical energy , says the chemist . // From page 1 New strides for solar energy " It looks as if 20 percent of the energy in product gas is stored solar , " he says . As a result , such a process should be able to produce fuels using half the coal consumption of conventional methods . The solar furnace at White Sands focused the equivalent of 1,800 suns through a fused quartz window into an L-shaped chamber . The tests were small- scale and used about 50 pounds of coal each . The coal was stacked into the vertical leg of the chamber with the window at the bottom . High-pressure jets around the window provided the steam . As the coal at the focus turned to gas , more coal fell into place like pellets in a rabbit feeder . The gas produced is known as " medium-btu . " It carries about one-third the energy content per unit volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by conventional means or converted to hydrogen , which is needed to process coal into liquid fuel . " I 've been doing experiments for 17 years and never come across something that worked this well , " says Dr. Gregg , who has worked previously on laser fusion and underground coal gasification . " I keep looking forthe hidden flaw , but so far I have n't been able to find it . " What impressed the scientist most was the " tolerant nature " of the process . After a critical temperature was reached , the quality of the gas produced was uniform even with vibrations in the sunlight through the quartz window ? with temperature changes caused by clouds acting overhead and wandering of the focus due to wind . In addition , the process appears to have considerable flexibility . Municipal wastes can be mixed with the coal and it also can be used to retort , or cook the oil out of , oil shale . Before undertaking these DOE-funded experiments , Dr. Gregg did a rough calculation of the economics of such a process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar coal gasification would be slightly lower than for conventional methods . " What this says is that we may be talking about a price of $2 per gallon for synthetic gasoline . But we certainly are not talking about $10 per gallon , " says Dr. Gregg . " Either I 'm crazy or this is a significant breakthrough , " the scientist thinks .
