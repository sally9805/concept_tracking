FOR several months now , " cabled TIME 'S Saigon Bureau Chief Jonathan Larsen , " relations between the press corps and the military command in Saigon have grown chillier and chillier . With little combat reporting to be done , journalists have begun scrounging around base camps and rear areas , asking questions about drugs , fragging , phony decorations and morale . The Army has retaliated by refusing interviews , bird-dogging correspondents in the field , and generally administering the news with an eyedropper . " <P> For Larsen and his colleagues-both in Indochina and Washington - even an eyedropper 's worth of information would have been greeted with heartfelt cheers during much of last week . Seeking to report a cover story on General Creighton Abrams and the biggest allied operation since the thrust into Cambodia , TIME 'S correspondents ran up against a news blackout so complete that it seemed almost laughable . As Dewey Canyon II got under way , Saigon newsmen were briefed ( in the truest sense of the word ) , told that all news was embargoed and then informed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by picking up a stray fact here , a veiled hint there and by sifting through previous information Larsen &; Co. had arrived at a sketchy idea of what was going on . <P> Meanwhile in Washington , the most dramatic blackout since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis saw , in the words of Diplomatic Correspondent William Mader , the same " intense expenditure of shoe leather , seemingly endless knocking on doors , convoluted probing and painstaking mosaic work .

" At one point a three-star Army general said rather plaintively , ' I was left out of Son Tay the U.S. raid on the North Vietnamese prison camp , and I am embarrassed to say I seem to have been left out of this one , too . ' " <P> Nevertheless , by the time the embargo was finally lifted midweek , considerable detail was already flowing into New York , where Timothy James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own knowledge from a previous trip to South Viet Nam . On-the-scene reportage came from James Willwerth , who hitched a plane ride from Saigon to I Corps , where he viewed the situation at Khe Sanh and Lang Vei , a point about three miles from the Laotian border . By now the final elements were falling into place as cables arrived from Stanley Cloud , who had flown from Bangkok to Vientiane for the story from inside Laos . " Vientiane is a kind of convention center for those who wage war and intrigue in Southeast Asia , " Cloud reported , " and Russians . Chinese and North Vietnamese diplomats are as busy as Americans , Indians and British in the furious race for information and , if one is lucky , facts . "
