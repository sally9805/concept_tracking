Once a year , deep down in Texas , comes green-up time and the blooming of the yellow rose . Also , once a year , a lady of some eighty summers mounts her pickup truck and drives out of the holler where she lives , making tracks for a hill some miles distant . That hill is not Pike 's Peak nor is it Mt . McKinley or Mt . Marcy . But it will do . Because when she unfurls the fantastic sky-scratching aerial she has rigged up for her truck radio , she will hear the voice of a man in Indiana who will tell her what she wants to know . He will tell her about what is happening in a 500-mile race of horseless carriages . And she will listen , enthralled , for a full four and one-half hours . Once a year , also , in Indiana , a crowd variously estimated at from 300,000 to 500,000 souls will congregate on a tract of 539 acres to witness the same race . They are probably more informed about automobiles as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are there to witness the famed " 500 " which may well be the most exciting sports event in the world . They may have driven for many days to get there . Perhaps they have found only somebody 's lawn to park on , because the city of Indianapolis , where the race is run , suddenly swells its population to a bursting point ; and perhaps the family has had to sleep in their car and find meals where they could , so as to be on hand for the start . Well , they are there , right on the spot . And what do they do ? Chances are that , as they watch the race from their coveted seats ( the grandstands are sold out months in advance and even general admission tickets are regarded as prized possessions ) they will not only have the advantage of seeing what is going on before their eyes in this big racing event , they may also be advised throughout by their immediate neighbors  --  who are bound to be racing buffs  --  and also by the loudspeaker system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening down there on the track . But the odds are that with all of this inside dope , they also will come equipped with transistor radios to hear the broadcast of the race , and to listen to the same voice which the little old lady in Texas is straining her ears to catch at the same time . The voice is that of Sid Collins , the man who has for twenty-five years now  --  with a staff he calls " the greatest in the world " ? broadcast the news of the race , over more than 1200 stations this year to over one hundred million listeners . And the plain fact is , whether you are two thousand miles away or just a few yards from the track , until you see the race through his eyes and hear him tell it like it is , you just ai n't in on the big 500 . Because something about this man , something in his knowledge of racing , in his love for the sport , in his insatiable search for the pertinent fact about driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has through the years convinced untold hordes of listeners that you ca n't experience this fantastic event without Sid , whether you 're right there next to the checkered flag or half the globe removed from it . Everywhere in the world where U.S. service personnel are deployed , Sid 's voice will be heard describing the race as only he can . In South America and Central America , his broadcast will be translated into Spanish and Portuguese ; in other areas , into French and Italian . In Canada , fifty stations will relay his words . The director of the network , an ex-race driver himself , Elmer George , arranges with AT &T; for approximately 50,000 miles of telephone lines over which the race and the four time-trial broadcasts are carried . One of TV 's highest-paid stars recently chortled that he had reached forty million viewers on a special broadcast , highly advertised and promoted with fantastic hoopla . Well , bully for him . Sid Collins can double it and still walk away with twenty million to the good . Because the 500 is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event in terms of human suspense that I 've ever known . " What has really happened here is that a uniquely engrossing sports event has found a man who is an artist in his own way at making it come alive to others who share the same deep-seated affection for the spectacle . It gets down to the right man at the right place at the right time , and now this has happened for twen ty-fiVe years running . And since Sid is a big , powerful man in his prime , and the sport of racing and the 500 in particular are booming like never before , we are witnessing in his performance the creation of an institution which seems to get better every year , and which everybody who has ever heard it devoutly hopes will go on into the infinite . If you are one of those wretched wights who has never listened to Sid 's broadcasts or watched the brave blur of the racing monsters streaking around the Speedway , you may still ponder the causes of it all and seek to know the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much to be proud of  --  its natural resources , the vision of its founding fathers , the flow of lifeblood from other nations into its strength  --  that it takes conquering for granted and wastes little emotion on it . It builds cities , conquers prairies , bridges rivers , even penetrates the universe without so much as a backward glance . Americans are usually divided in their loves as well as their opinions , but in all the clash of their personalities and beliefs , they have held unanimously and firmly to one fundamental love  --  they have been carrying on an affair with the automobile since the first puny little pretender puffed its smoky challenge to the horse , and their affection for the fuel-driven pony gets more intense by the year . Oddly enough , the love affair is not necessarily a passion for speed in itself . Mr. An ton Hulman , known as Tony to everyone who knows him and to millions who do not , is the patrician owner of the Indianapolis Speedway , and even he has to wonder a bit what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a laugh the year of 1945 when he bought the " brick-yard " from Eddie Rickenbacker . " The war was over , aircraft were flying four and five hundred miles an hour , and people were saying that no one would bother to come and see cars running around a track at a hundred or so . They said that automobile racing was through . We were n't sure we were even going to sell a seat . " He laughs with understandable relish as he says this . The 500 was more jammed in 1972 than ever before . Why ? . . . well , no one has told me , not even Tony Hulman , but I think that it is because racing an automobile has something to do with man 's fate and the brief moment he can  --  or thinks he can  --  direct it here on earth . Sid Collins points out that driving a racing car is a solitary test of a man 's heart , stamina , and " the fear that is sometimes known as courage . " The driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly refined abilities , men he will joust with at over 200 miles per hour in the straightaways , in traffic jams only a few inches away from the death whirling in the car 's wheels , on turns lashed at by centrifugal force that shakes a pulverization of man and machine against the wall down to a matter of a slight pressure of the fingers on the steering wheel . It is man 's will and skill against fantastic odds , and the penalty of a mistake is often death or injury . Somehow or other , that test of the man alone has clung to racing while aircraft at their higher speeds , and the technical marvels of computers , even war itself as a sad science have become mere mechanical equations . Every kid yearns to tinker with a car engine and turn it into a masterpiece of screaming power that will skim his buggy faster across mother earth than that of his best friend and rival . On the other end of the scale , Sid Collins has an interesting observation to make : " Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But almost all of the astronauts have come around to the track at some time or another . And the funny thing is that the astronauts , fascinated as they are by the cars , nearly all say the same thing ? " you could n't get me into one of those ... they 're too dangerous ! " That 's part of it , then . The enduring love affair between Americans and the automobile . It would not be wholly fair to say that the efforts of Sid Collins alone complete the picture at the Indianapolis Speedway , since there are hundreds of others involved who contribute to that enormous accomplishment . Yet he plays a key role , and it would be hard to talk about the 500 ? after these twenty-five years in which he has been its official voice all over the globe  --  and not say that Sid has played a real part in its development . For instance , he has become a celebrity in his own right and enjoyed some of the usual privileges accorded such public recognition : he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Admiral of the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska , an Honorary Mayor of Helena , Montana , a Texas Ranger , Variety 's " Man of the Year . " And out in the farm country where they take such things as animal husbandry seriously , a champion hog is named after him ( who it must be presumed will perpetuate the name through generations of piglets to come ) . He has had his picture taken with practically every famous racing driver since 1948 , with Cyd Charisse among a bevy of other beauties , and there is always the chance that he may someday be kissed by Andy Granatelli , the tough car builder who becomes ecstatic in victory . Sid wears these and a dozen more similar honors lightly , but there are a couple of other accolades which are perhaps more meaningful to him and to us here . In 1962 , on Sid 's fifteenth anniversary as the 500 " voice , " he was surprised by a trophy which now rests in his study , donated by the thirty-three drivers starting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing the hat from garage to garage , with 1960 winner Jim Ratlunann doing the collecting . It is a handsome one indeed . . . but not more handsome than the inscription which says in part , " In appreciation for his valued service to the racing fraternity as the voice of the 500 . " Racing drivers do n't usually take that kindly to specialists in another craft . This was the only time , before or since , that the drivers have so honored anybody . Sid also owns a similar award given by the National Car Owners Association , stimulated by his pal J.C . Agajanian , the veteran car owner . Sid too has received the Edenbum Trophy . A good five feet in height , it stands in the Speedway Museum , flanked by such marvels as the Marmon Wasp which won the 500 in 191 I and the big , wide-wheeled sinister powerhouses of later years . Sid 's name was added in 1969 to a long list of racing greats including Tony Hulman , Raymond Firestone and Wilbur Shaw . Only one name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much given to praise of others in the reporting game , whether vocal or otherwise . But Jim Murray , one of the best , whose syndicated column emanates from the Los Angeles Times , has this to say about Sid : " I guess the toughest athletic event ... to call by radio or TV is the Indianapolis 500 . . . I t is widely believed that more people know the Einstein Theory than were able to figure out who was leading the 500 for the last twenty laps this year ( 1966 ) . In the first place ( for the second year in the past three ) the field had been shriveled by two-thirds . Even before the race was really started , the air was full of flying rivets , wheels , axles , and cars and drivers were scaling fences and heading for the Ohio border on the double . They even had a traffic jam in Victory Lane at the end . Two cars showed up to claim the win . One of the guys out of the 300,000 on hand who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man known as the voice of the 500 ' . " And Jim went on to praise Sid for a full column . So it becomes pretty clear that our man has a lot more going for him than just being out there on his own in front of the biggest sports crowd gathered in any one year at one place . One thing may be his experience , of course . Sid is a well set-up guy who wears his middle years well . But just the same he started out with and survived many great names in announcing that were similarly connected with one particular sport  --  men like Bill Stern , Bill Corum , Clem McCarthy , Ted Husing  --  the Curt Gowdys and Chris Schenkels of another era . No other announcer 's voice has been so integral to and identified with any one sport as Sid Collins 's has with auto racing . Some of Sid 's assets hark back to those years . He talks with a kind of old-fashioned authority in his somewhat courtly manner , and it sits well today , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed by a tendency to speak for himself when he wants to , or believes that the broadcast will gain by it . One of the jokes Sid has to field as gracefully as he can several million times between races is that he has the softest job in the world since he works only one day a year . This is not precisely the case . Sid is the sports director of station WI BC in Indianapolis and has been for over two decades . He has broadcast over 9000 consecutive nightly sports programs on the station , including calling Big Ten football and basketball games and Olympic swimming and ice-skating trials , not to mention Indiana 's high-school basketball tournament , where one misplaced word in that hoop-oriented Hoosier state could well earn him a ride out of town on a rail . He has shared the TV mike with people like Garry Moore and Steve Allen . Sid is also Director of Auto Racing for radio station KLAC in Los Angeles , hotbed of the sport . Besides this , Sid has served as anchor man for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network in New York . He makes talks all over America and is much sought after as an MC and banquet toastmaster . What it all comes down to is that Collins is a freelance sports announcer with a number of clients , and his heart given completely to one of them , the 500 . Tony Hulman praises Sid not only for his accomplished delivery and poise but for the mass of in-formation the announcer has stashed away somewhere in his mind . This is probably true , but Sid denies being a walking com-puter . " I really do n't need to be , do I , when I can call on the greatest drivers and mechanics and track historians to help me out at a minute 's notice , right there on the track ? " Just the same , Sid comes to the track every 500 day with a two-suiter crammed with his homework  --  histories of all the drivers , mechanical breakdowns of the cars , dope on the mechanics , owners , the pit crews themselves , and anything else that experience has taught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swirl of events and accidents beyond his power to control or manipulate . " Happily " ( Sid 's word ) , he does not need to call on his stashaway library very often . To begin with , he has a team of experts right at his elbow . For the past fourteen years , it has included Freddie Agabashian-and currently Len Sutton-both racing drivers of yore . In addition , a young Englishman named Donald Davidson came all the way from London at his own expense to prove that he had memorized everything there was to know about the 500 since its inception . He had , too , to the astonishment of 500 regulars who are no slouches themselves at that game . So he stayed on as a member of Sid 's team . John de Camp , Purdue engineering graduate , handles statistics . Sid Collins can use a team , despite the fact that in the long four-and-one-half-hour broadcast he does about 80 percent of the talking himself . But what makes his accomplishment border virtually on the miraculous is that he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Speedway ) . If you are oriented to the sight of a football stadium holding say , 100,000 spectators and thinking of this as being something pretty big . the Indianapolis Speedway will set your sights agoggling . The stands hold 200,000 , and the sections on the backstretch are merely a blur as seen from the finish line , more than a couple of miles away . The straightaways are each a mile long , and the turns at the ends each a quarter of a mile , which puts the action across two and a half miles , not a hundred yards . There are thirty-three racers out there at the start and it is not long , what with engine trouble , cars passing and or making pit stops , and possibly a tangle or two , before to the neophyte the track is just one long parade of snarling cars , with no recognizable leader and no tail runner . Well , Sid stands high in the tower right above the finish line ( " hanging on the clouds by my thumbs " ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full run of the cars . He can see perhaps seventy-five yards up the straightaway to his right- where the cars come slamming down towards the main stands-about 100 yards to his left as far as the first turn , and only about 15 percent of the pit action . Naturally he knows the track like the palm of his hand . In fact he drove me around it in solitary splendor in his Caddy , not trying for speed ( " Yellow is my racing color , " he says with a grin ) but still putting across the sight and sense of the racing driver taking those banked ( 9 degrees and 12 minutes ) turns and then heavy-footing it down the chute of the grandstands on the straightaways at better than 200 miles an hour . It is an eerie sensation and it can not help but tighten up the stomach muscles a bit on the first time around , just at the very thought of what these men go through for 200 laps , if they make it to the finish . ( They might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pack they are : the last man usually earns at least $10,000 in the above-a-million given out to the winner and those who are back there eating his exhaust . ) So what Sid must do is to orchestrate a barrage of reports from his team of spotters out there at various vantage points on the track . He has binoculars , but he needs their eyes more . Sid 's stand-in eyes and ears out there are Mike Ahearn , turn one ; Howdy Bell , turn two ; Doug Zink , middle backstretch ; Ron Carrell , turn three ; Jim Shelton , turn four . He handles the start and finish straightaway himself . Chuck Marlowe patrols the north pit , Luke Walton the center pit , and Lou Palmer the south pit and Victory Lane the minute the winner comes in . Sid used to cover Victory Lane himself , but in 1950 , when the race was stopped early at 345 miles by rain , he had to blast his way down there in a surprise dash . " Like a horse , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , remembering that he approached winner Johnny Parsons from the side where the white-hot exhaust pipe was . The crowd forced him against it until his trousers smoked . He got out of that by bracing both feet against the side of the car and pushing back against the crowd with all he had . Sid has a producer , Jack Morrow , but the orchestration on the broadcast is a duet of timing-including even when to slide in a commercial . He is not the one to permit a break in any action even for the sake of a paid announcement ( a situation the sponsors respect and condone , by the way ) . Collins has a couple of runners constantly checking the thirty-three track " spotters " on the tower deck below , to make sure that the time and order of the race are known to him continuously . He also has two men just to keep an eye on the lead car , whatever that one is , as well as another standing by in the hospital area in case news takes a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers thirty-five members , every last man dedicated to getting the right news to Sid as it happens . The decisions are entirely up to him . Even as he is broadcasting his topic of the moment-he can not talk about the lead car for the entire four hours of therace , of course , and must take side excursions into interviews , racing anecdotes , personal sides of the drivers , and the like-he must keep flicking his eyes at communiques coming in from all of his field men : a tangle of cars here , an unexpected pit stop there , a quick change of places on the straightaway two and a half miles away from him across the Speedway , and much , much more . All this makes tremendous demands on the stamina , brains , reflexes , and judgment of the man in the tower . ( Old-timers still call it the " pagoda " after the Oriental-styled wooden tower erected by the first owner of the Speedway , Carl G. Fisher , The pagoda went down in 1958 , the victim of old age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that year , in a losing race with its vast colony of termites . ) Sid is up to all this or he would n't be there year after year , getting better all the time . Not long out of Indiana University ( where he graduated as an officer of his senior class in 1944 just in time to hop into a U.S. Army truck and go on to K.P . that evening at Fort Benjamin Harrison and the European theater somewhat later ) Sid got his first chance at track announcing in 1948 when they set him to working the south turn , under Bill Slater in the pagoda . Sid 's big break came in 1950. when Slater took ill and Sid moved into the top spot under emergency pressures . He did n't crack , and that 's how the sorcerer 's apprentice first got the magic wand in his hand . Tony Hulman 's faith in Sid has never wavered . Hulman shows a gentleman sportsman 's reti-cence in comparing Sid to other race-track announcers , but his inner message is clear . Says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at tracks all over the world , and I would say that Sid is easily . . . er , ... one of the best . " Freely translated : Sid is It . Collins started out wanting to be a doctor , during his boyhood in Indianapolis . He hustled in his father 's store , deliv- ered newspapers , and attended college with that in view . But three years in the Army broke up the pre-med pattern of study , and he became a broadcaster in Kokomo , on then WKMO , now WIOJ . What makes Sid tick today in his specialty is a gift for dramatizing racing , which he loves wholeheartedly , without overdoing it . He sees the color of it all : the pageant of 50,000 parked cars in the infield under the banners of the fifty states and all the nations of the world , the huge democracy of the 500-millionaires and farmers , businessmen and carhops , straining their eyes and ears at the same spectacle-the drama of the race drivers , such as one who came to the track first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sid talks to all these drivers and the crews . In the month preceding the big day , he strolls around the garages and workpits , passing a casual word here and there to a friend , making new contacts and learning hisjob from the inside . People take to Sid . He is free and easy , with no " side " to him at all . He has played golf with President Eisenhower , but he does n't change his manner when he 's swapping remarks with a lad who 's a specialist at changing a left rear wheel , and learning how to buy seconds of time which could mean a race won or lost . That same manner gets into his broadcasting , and perhaps that may be his greatest strength . Many announcers pontificate to the world at large , or mumble away to themselves . But something about Sid 's special delivery in that easy baritone , with just a touch of a soft down-home-in-Indiana accent , is one-to-one . The listener gets the idea that Sid is talking only to him , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what glues GI 's in North African stations to the radios in their tents when the temperature is 106 in the shade , and sailors on Bering S traits icebreakers to their earphones , when Sid is giving out with the 500 dope . One hundred million listeners . The postmarks of the mail received include one from a submerged submarine , and range to Dennis Hulme , a fan listening in Australia . And all in the palm of his hand . Most of us can tell our entire life history in five minutes and the rest of what we know in about eight to ten minutes more . It 's surprising how much you can say in sixty seconds , and how long just a twenty-minute spiel on any subject can be . But four and one-half hours of it ! Perhaps Sid 's greatest test came in 1964 . To begin with , he had developed a temperature of 102 and a sore throat the day before the race . He lost his voice , in fact , and had to walk around with a card asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeak out the first few minutes of the race . Which is in itself not easy . Sid confesses that every time Tony Hulman intones that heart-stirring command ? " Gentlemen , start your engines ! " ? he is so greatly moved he has all he can do to announce the start and then quickly throw the switch to Ahearn on the first turn . " Then professionalism takes over , " and he rolls through the rest of the race in stride . 1964 demanded his all , however . Sick and shaky already from his illness , and just hoping to get through the day . And then it happened . On the second lap there was a gigantic pile up coining out of the Number 4 turn . One by one the cars emerged to tool down the track . The cries went up in the grandstand : " There 's Foyt ! ? There 's Unser ! ? They 're OK ! They made it .. . " But two were missing . Driver Eddie Sachs and Dave McDonald were fatally injured in the accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , a man everyone loved . the so-called " clown prince of racing . " The race was halted . After the announcement there was not a sound in the stands . Men took off their hats . People were weeping . Sid closed his eyes , picked up his mike , and spoke softly into it . This is what he ad libbed , in part . " Some men try to conquer life in a number of ways . In these days of our outer-space attempts , some men try to conquer the universe . Race drivers are courageous men who try to conquer life and death . They calculate their risks and in our talking with them over the years , I think we know their inner thoughts . In regard to racing , they take it as a part of living . " The race driver who leaves this earth mentally when he straps himself into the cockpit , to try for what is to him the biggest conquest he can make , is aware of the odds- and Eddie Sachs played the odds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he was a wonderful gentleman . He took much needling and gave much needling and just as the astronauts do perhaps , these boys on the race track ask no quarter and they give none . If they succeed they 're heroes , and if they fail , they have tried , and it was Eddie 's desire , I am sure , and his will to try with everything he had , which he always did . " So the only healthy way perhaps we can approach the tragedy of the loss of a friend like Eddie Sachs is to know that he would have wanted us to face it as he did . . . as it has happened ... not as we wish it would have happened . . . We 're all speeding toward death at the rate of sixty minutes every hour  --  only difference is that we do n't know how to speed and Eddie Sachs did . And so , since death has a thousand or more doors , Eddie Sachs exits this earth in a race car , and knowing Eddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Byron said , ' Whom the Gods love die young ' . . . . Eddie was thirty-seven . To his widow Nancy and to his two children , we extend our extreme sympathy and regret . This boy won the pole in 1961 and 1962 ... and was a proud race driver . " Well , as we do at Indianapolis and in racing , the race continues . unfortunately today without Eddie Sachs . " After the race 30,000 letters poured in to Sid acclaiming his eulogy and/or asking for a copy . Some wondered how he had been able to find a minister so quickly to speak those words  --  they could hardly credit a broadcaster with such spiritual eloquence . One hardbitten curmudgeon accused Sid of having prepared thirty-three such eulogies in advance , one for each driver , to produce at such a moment ! But Sid needs no preparation to speak from the heart . He does it all the time , on and off the track . That day he and his staff had to talk for six hours straight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a hushed halt for the first time in the 500 's history . After six hours of steady broadcasting , they wrapped up the marathon broadcast at last at 4:27 . Sid had been on since 10:30 . Psychologists please note : at 4:30 , his sore throat was gone . He smiles often and easily . One time the joke was on him ( or perhaps not ) , having to do with his little habit of dreaming the winner of the 500 and placing the name in a sealed envelope before the race . He correctly dreamed Wallard in ' 51 , Ward in ' 59 , and Andretti in ' 69 . Sid psyched the Andretti prediction a bit and broke his rule of secrecy by announcing at a dinner two weeks before the race that he had dreamed of Andretti as the winner . Mario himself was in the audience that evening . That gave Sid something of a name as a dreamboat . And so the next year he was besieged by drivers asking him to divulge who it was he had dreamed about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Raquel Welch . " Unlike other sportscasters , Sid always signs off quoting a serious thought or a bit of poetry , dedicating it to the Indianapolis 500 winner . Among many he has used over the years was this by Henry David Thoreau : " If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined , he will meet with a success unexpected . " It would appear that those words can be applied to Sid Collins . 2,7 ample seat of the tractor , rolling along the road into the woods behind the house . By this time , Gloriana , being young and basically healthy , had completely revived . She thanked us for our rescue efforts , and began prattling along enthusiastically about how much she was enjoying what she considered a great adventure , and how much she admired the woods , the mountains , the beautiful white snow , and the entire State of Vermont . Meanwhile , I was congratulating myself on this extraordinary piece of good luck . Monkeyface had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objecting . So Gadget and I had a clear field to pour on the syrup . And we did a wonderful job . We agreed with everything Gloriana said . We suggested gently that we were all three of us a group of nature lovers , and that Monkeyface , although a bit gruff and tough on the outside , was inwardly more of a true nature lover than anybody . We told the thrilling story of how , many years ago , as a young and dedicated pioneer environmentalist , he had engineered a sanitary landfill on the lake front in Chicago . We explained his plans for developing his property , and we explained everything so pleasantly and so convincingly that Gloriana agreed with everything we said . By the time we reached the stalled camper , everything was sweetness and light . We then used the same system on the ladies in the camper . And it was absurdly easy . By this time we had the highly intelligent Gloriana on our side . She explained that Mr. Mulligan 's plans for developing his property were ecologically sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenery , enjoying themselves , and agreeing that they had no objections to the plans for improving the area . They admitted they had been wrong , and they were sorry they had instructed Gloriana to send Mr. Mulligan such a discourteous letter . There was only one moment of doubt . One of the ladies had noticed a small dam which had flooded a few acres of forest and killed a number of trees . " Is this , " she asked sarcastically , " the way to preserve the natural beauty of the wilderness ? " I was just on the point of starting a big argument when Gadget nudged me . I promptly changed my attitude . I smiled . " That is a good question , " I said . " I am glad you asked . It gives me a chance to explain what you and I already know , but what some of the others may not have noticed . This dam was not built by Mr. Mulligan . It was built by a group of such enthusiastic nature lovers that they may be justly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , beavers . They should be encouraged rather than criticized . " This tactful remark gave all the ladies a chance to pretend that they had known all about it all the time . And it caused them to withdraw all criticism of this dam . Note : It seems to be part of the creed of most ecological true believers that a dam built by people is artificial and thus very bad , whereas a dam built by beavers is part of nature and is thus very good . Incidentally , I discovered later that this particular dam had actually been built by old Monkeyface himself to provide a water supply for his house . Beavers had nothing to do with it . But this minor error on my part was of no importance . None of the ladies knew any more about it than 1 did . Having cleared up this final ob-
