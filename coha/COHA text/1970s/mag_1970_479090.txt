Vor most of us who were burnbefore World War I- II , America was a place to be discovered : it was imperfect , perhaps ? needed some reform , some shaping up ? but it did not need to he reinvented . It was all given , like a genetic code , waiting to unfold . We all wanted to learn the style , the proper accent , agreed on its validity , and while our interpretations and our heroes varied , they were all cut from the same stock . Cowboys , pioneers , athletes , entrepreneurs , men of letters : whatever we were offered we took pretty much as our own . Whether we were small-town boys or the children of urban immigrants . we shared an eagerness to become apprentices in the great open democracy , were ready to join up , wanting only to be accepted according to the terms that history and tradition had already established . It never occurred to us to think otherwise . What held that world together was not just a belief in some standardized version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular class of people and institutions that we identified with our vision of the country . The people were white and Protestant : the institutions were English : American culture was WASP . We paid lip service to the melting pot , but if , for instance , one 's grandmother asked , " Is it good for the Jews ? " there was n't any quesi ion in her mind about who was running the country . The critics , the novelists , the poets , the social theorists , the men who articulated and analyzed American ideas , who governed our institutions , who embodied what we were or hoped to be ? nearly all of them were WASPs : Hemingway , Fitzgerald , Eliot , MacLeish , Sanclburg. , Lewis , Steinbeck , Dewey . Santavana. the Jameses , Beard , Parrington .

Of all the major figures discussed by Henry Steele Cornmager in The American Mind , not one is a Jew . a Catholic , or a Negro . The American mind was the WASP mind . We grew up with them : they surrounded us : they were the heroes of the history we studied and of the fantasy life we sought in those Monday ? through-Friday radio serials . Even Hollywood , after all the creation of Jewish producers , never did much for pluralism . The stars were often ethnics ? show business and sports constituting two major avenues for " outsiders " to make it into the mainstream ? but their names and the roles they played rarely , if ever , acknowledged the existence of anything beyond that mainstream . The Hyman Kaplans were lovable jerks , immigrant Sao-thus ; Rochester said , " Yassuh , Mr. Benny " ( did we realize that Benny was a Jew ? ) and anything beginning with Mike , Pat . or Able was set up for a laugh . Hollywood 's Jews sold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WASPs ? never thought of themselves as anything but Americans , nor did it occur to others to label them as anything special until , about twenty-five years ago , their influence began to decline and they started to lose their cultural initiative and preeminence . There were , to be sure , regional distinctions , but whatever was " American " was WASP . Indeed , there was no " other " ? was , that is , no domestic base of social commentary , no voice except their voice , for the discussion of " American " problems . The ethnics had their place and their strong loyalties , but insofar as that place was American it was defined by WASPs . We could distinguish Jews , Irishmen , Italians , Catholics , Poles , Negroes , Indians , Mexican-Americans . Japanese-Americans , but not WASPs . When WASPs were alienated it was because , as in the case of Henry Adams , the country had moved away from them , not because , as with the others , they regarded themselves as alien in heritage or tradition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? in that respect ? alien , ethnically WASPs but also in some sense unwilling immigrants : they were among the first to be out of place in their own country . ) For most WASPs , their complaints were proprietary . That is , the old place was going down because the tenants were n't keeping it up properly . They were the landlords of our culture , and their values , with rare exceptions , were those that defined it : hard work , perseverance , self-reliance , puritanism , the missionary spirit , and the abstract rule of law . They are , of course , still with us ? in corporations and clubs , in foundations and universities , in government and the military . maintaining the interlocking directorates that make sociologists salivate and that give the Establishment its ugly name : the Power Structure , the Military-Industrial Complex ; the rulers of America . But while they still hold power , they hold it with less assurance and with less legitimacy than at any time in history . They are hanging on . men living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create more . One can almost define their domains by locating the people and institutions that are chronically on the defensive : university presidents and trustees ; the large foundations ; the corporations : government ; the military . They grew great as initiators and entrepreneurs . They invented the country , its culture and its values ; they shaped the institutions and organizations . Then they drew the institutions around themselves , moved to the suburbs , and became org-men . WY ho and what has replaced them , then , in the invention and production of our culture ? Jews and Negroes , Catholics and immigrants . " Of the Americans who have come into notice during the past fifty years as poets , as novelists , as critics , as painters , as sculptors , and in the minor arts , " wrote Henry Mencken in 1924. , " less than half bear Anglo-Saxon names .... So in the sciences , so in the higher reaches of engineering and technology .... " Mencken 's declaration was premature then ; it is an understatement now : Mailer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Teller and Robert Oppenheimer and Wernher von Braun : Ralph Nader and Cesar Chavez : Noam Chomsky and Allen Ginsberg ; John Rock and Jonas Salk : Paul Goodman and Herbert Marcuse ; Bruno Bettelheim and Erik Erikson ; Eldridge Cleaver and Malcolm X and Martin Luther King . The 1969 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction was divided between a Jew from Brooklyn ( Mailer ) and a French immigrant ( Rene Duhos ) ; the Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded to an American Indian ( Scott Momadayl . The spokesmen of American literature and culture tend increasingly to represent the pluralistic residues of a melting pot thai ? for better or worse ? never worked as well as some Americans had hoped . It is not simply that many of the major postwar journals of criticism ? Commentary . The New York Review of Books , The New American Review ? are edited by Jews . or that Time is edited by a Jewish refugee from Hitler , or that The Saturday Evening Post is dead , or that the function of radical muckraking was revitalized by Ramparts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buckley , a Catholic , is the most articulate conservative in America ; we do , after all , still have WASP writers and journals ? Foreign . Affairs , for example , and The Atlantic ( not to mention Life or Reader 's Digest ) . It is , rather , that the style , ideas , traumas , perplexities , and passions tend to reflect other backgrounds and interests , and that the integrative capabilities of the WASP style have plunged into precipitous decline . The cultural issues of the 1960s enjoying the greatest cachet were not only ethnic and pluralistic , but also **27;2609;TOOLONG the Identity Crisis , Black Power , Doing Your Own Thing , Dropping Out , the White Negro ? and it seemed that any kind of material was acceptable as long as it was distinguishable from the old WASP mainstream : the life of the black ? ghetto. rock music and long hair and pot , Hindu gurus and Zen philosophers , Cuban guerrillas and Catholic radicals , black hustlers and Jewish anarchists . ( The first thing I learned , coming from Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I3ullsliit " when you disagreed with someone , even your roommate . You said " Yes , but ... " Now bullshit is back in style . ) For the young , the chief villainy of the age is to be uptight , and who seems to them more uptight than WASPs , or the Jews and Irishmen trying to be like them ? The 1960s was the decade of gaps ? missile gaps , credibility gaps , generation gaps ? when we became . in many respects , a nation of outsiders , a country in which the mainstream , however mythic , lost its compelling energy and its magnetic attraction . Now that the New Frontier and the Great Society have failed ( not only as programs but as verbal rituals ) so , at least for the moment . has the possibility of integration and , with it , traditional Americanism . The Average Man has become the Silent Majority . Both of these , of course , are merely convenient political fiction , but the change in labels points to a far deeper crisis of belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or numbers ? but that the once-unquestioned assumptions on which that power was based have begun to lose their hold . The foundation of WASP dominance in national polities and culture rested on the supposition that WASPdom was the true America , no subculture or special group . Now WASPs are beset by the need to enforce allegiance to something that their very place in power is supposed to take for granted . The problem is then compounded : government can become increasingly gray , trying to represent ( or not to offend ) " all the people , " or it can begin to act as the voice of a distinctive group ( the Forgotten Man , the Silent Majority ) ? in other words , to represent the majority as if it were a minority . iThere is a third alternative , which I 'll discuss later . ) Nixon , characteristically , is trying to do both . When he was first elected in 1968 he brought to Washington a Cabinet of nonentities selected , it seemed . to illustrate the fix we were in : Winton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the old Agnew . ( The exceptions ? neither was then a regular Cabinet member ? were Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 86 an Irishman , and Henry Kissinger , a Central European immigrant . ' They were men without visible personality , class , or place . Something of the same was true in Washington under Eisenhower , but then the Eisenhower atmosphere was tempered by an older lingering sense of independence , of region , a sense ? finaliy ? of principle . John Foster Dulles may have been a dangerous moralist , a stubborn Puritan , but he was not plastic . Nixon brought with him no John McCloy , no John Gardner , no Nelson Rockefeller ( let alone a George C. Marshall or a Henry Stimson from an even earlier era of WASP assertion ) nor does he carry Eisenhower 's aura of small ? town decency . ( Eisenhower 's men , like Nixon's. were or are institutional men , but many of them came from a tradition of " service " in which the social purposes of institutions tended to be more important than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " low profiles , " gray men who represent no identifiable place , no region , no program . The security of the historic WASP position made regional roots and styles attractive ; you were n't just an American but an American from a specific place , with a personality , with foibles and prejudices and altitudes . You did n't have to prove you were a WASP . But where is Nixon from ? In what accent does he speak ? What is his style , what are his convictions , even his hobbies ? Nixon 's campaign , his public conduct , and his tastes reflect not only the **26;2638;TOOLONG residue of WASPishness ; they also symbolize the new insecurity of the mainstream culture . There are advantages in all this : gray men are not crusaders ; they do n't speak about massive retaliation or final solutions I or . on the other hand , to he sure , the Great Society ) . But they are likely to regard any sort of noise as offensive and possibly dangerous . For a moment this afforded us some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the offices of Agnew and Mitchell , turned this quality of his Administration into a serious matter . The noise ( of students , of Black Power , of protest ) was , and is , searing them . And for the firs ( time in history ? certainly for the first time since the 1920s ? the majority has begun to act like a minority . like an ethnic group . The powerful are paranoid about the weak . ( And needless to say . many ethnic groups are acting more like ethnic groups than they have at any time since the melting pot was pronounced a success . ) This is what makes Agnew potentially more dangerous than Joe McCarthy . - McCarthy 's quarrels , finally , were those of an outsider attacking the Establishment , and the Establishment , which was still running the country , despite a bad case of nerves , ultimately put him down . But Agnew , Mitchell , and Nixon are the government , and among their most important targets are people who have no money , little organization , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nixon 's targets is not that of a foreign power . lint that of a culture . or cultures at odds with the mainstream . Inquisitions and witch-hunts generally mark the end , or the beginning of the end , of an age . O ne of the major attributes of the WASP idiom was its self-confidence in its own Americanism . In following the ethic of the small town , in trying to make it , the WASP was operating in a system designed by his people , operated by his people , and responsive to his people . He was n't trying to stand somebody else 's ground or beat somebody else 's game . But what is there for a nation that is urban ( or suburban ) , in which the majority has ( presumably ) already made it , and where size and technology are rendering much of the system impersonal and unresponsive ? It is no longer possible for anyone to control the country ( or the world ) as we once believed we could . With the exception of the balanced ticket ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so somewhere the self-confidence froze : what in the national spirit and imagery was expansive became conservative and restrictive , enterprise turned to management , ebullience to caution . Most of all , it tended to become dull . One of the most graphic illustrations of these differences hi spirit is to be found in a book by John McPhee , Levels ol the Came , an account of a tennis match between the Negro Arthur Ashe ( then the highest-ranking American ) and the WASP Clark Craehner ( Shaker Heights suburban , ehurchy , the son of a dentist ) . Graehner speaks : I 've never been a flashy stylist , like Arthur . I 'm a fundamentalist . Arthur is a bachelor . I am married and a conservative . I 'm interested in business , in the market , in children 's clothes . It affects the way you play the game . He 's not a steady player . He 's a wristy skipper . Sometimes he does n't even know where the ball is going .... I 've never seen Arthur really discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haphazard mannerisms of a liberal . He 's an underprivileged type who worked his way up .... There is something about him that is swashbuckling , loose . He plays the way he thinks . My style is playntaking ? consistent , percentage tennis ? and his style is shotmaking . Ashe speaks : There is not much variety in Clark 's game . It is steady , accurate , and conservative . He makes few errors . He plays stiff , compact Republican tennis . Blacks , of course , can be disciplined grubbers as much as anyone else , and WASPs certainly never used to lack for swashbuckling types ? soldiers , tycoons , ball players , frontiersmen , outlaws . Ashe , obviously , had to grub a lot harder than any white man to break into the big time , or to become a player at all , but he now manages his games with an aristocratic flair , not with what seems to be bourgeois lack of grace . But Graebner 's description is otherwise right : he plays percentage tennis . Ashe takes chances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as Ashe says ) , " accurate , stiff , compact . " A little uptight . In taking risks there is more to lose than to gain . A lot of people , needless to say , have only barely made it , or have n't made it at all : prominent among them Negroes , Puerto Ricans , Poles , Irishmen , Italians , and a good number of underclass WASPs . For them the decline in confidence tends to he traumatic . At the very moment that they are persuaded , or forced to believe , that the system will work for them ? that they can make it , that their children must go to college , and all the rest ? the signals from headquarters become confused and indistinct , and the rules seem to change . The children of the affluent march in the streets ; lung hair and at least the outward signals of sexual freedom are acceptable ; hard work , stoicism , and perseverance are n't the ultimate values ; individual initiative is not sufficient ; the schools are " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernization " ( the supermarket , urban renewal . automated equipment , Vatican II ) in abandon their own styles of life ? the hierarchical family , ward politics , closed unions , old neighborhoods , religion , language , food ? become witnesses to behavior indicating that the ( perhaps mythic ) mainstream has begun to stagnate , that a lot of people no longer believe in it , or no longer believe in the old ways of getting there . Those on the move upward and outward have , in other words , no attractive place to go . Which is to say that the underclass tenants have discovered the neglect of the landlord . Blacks are alienated because they have been kept out of the running . The white ethnics are frustrated because public attention , in defiance of the rhetoric of individual initiative and equality , has gone to blacks . ( And because affluent WASPS , who had discriminated against all minorities , are trying to shift the burden of blame on the white underclass . ) All of them , sensing the decline of WASP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order ( meaning militant normalcy , the old ethic , a return to their own cultural and political resources , or exotic combinations of the two . Following the lead , and to their eyes , success , of Black Power and Black Studies , a lot of minorities are trying to redevelop or to invent some exactly corresponding form of ethnic consciousness for themselves . Most of the whites , however , are or in the end will be content to cheer on the cops . For the first time we have Polish vigilantes and a Hebrew posse ( the Jewish Defense League ) . Blacks and honkies , talking like frontiersmen , are buying guns . If the old WASP ethic was the ethic of making it , it is n't surprising that the most militant contemporary exponents of that ethic ? those inclined to take its legends of force and action literally ? should be among people outside the system trying to break in . A measure of the decline of the WASP style ? perhaps the best measure we have ? is the conquest of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Neil Armstrong ) from the man who was still a conqueror trusting his own bets and his own skills . and therefore an underdog no dry runs , no simulators , no mission control ) to the org-man , programmed and computerized to the last 324-billion step and the last televised statement . betting his life on the competence and devotion of anonymous technicians : courageous yes , underdog never . A symbol of modern man , to be sure ( what if the trains stop or the electricity fails , what if the water becomes polluted and poisonous ? ) but also a sign of the decline of the great old WASP virtues of self-reliance , initiative , irreverence . Lindbergh was free enterprise ; Apollo was the work of a crowd . No ape could have flown the Spirit of St. Louis from New York to Paris . But we could have sent an ape to the moon . Or a robot . With a fake flag artificially distended for a dead place where there is no wind . It was a WASP enterprise all the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Jew ? or a woman ? Muhammad Ali perhaps ? Joe Namath ? Norman Mailer ( who wanted to go ) ? Can one conceive of an astronaut who does not fit absolutely congruously into the background , like Muzak in a supermarket or Spiro Agnew at a picnic of Legionnaires ? Can one conceive of an astronaut 's wife living in a Jewish section of the Bronx , or expressing an opinion critical of the Vietnam war , or not taking the children to church on Sunday , or having a career of her own ? Was it not inevitable that one of the wires would get down on her knees in front of the television set to pray for a safe reentry ? ( One can imagine , in that setting , that Walter Cronkite is God.1 Can one expect Richard Nixon not to say that the mission was the greatest thing since the Creation ? or Billy Graham not to suggest , in reply , that perhaps the Resurrection was more important ? What made the moonshot interesting was its unbelievably bad taste , the taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs and corporation offices , network television and the electric toothbrush , airline pilots and airline hostesses , " the whole mechanical consolidation of force , " as Henry Adams wrote in the Education , " which ruthlessly stamped out the life of the class into which Adams was born , but created monopolies capable of controlling the new energies that America adored . " Clearly space travel is technologically impossible except as a collective enterprise . But that is precisely the point . There is no role for the American ( i.e. WASP ) hero . Heroes presumably defy great odds alone . Gary Cooper has been replaced by Dustin Hoffman . You ask yourself : Does the Establishment live ? And the answer , clearly . is Yes . And yet it does not live in the style to which it was accustomed . Ever since the development of large bureaucracies and tenure systems there has been a tendency among outside intellectuals to overestimate the influence of elites . Not that corporations and institutions are going out of style ( and they may , in case of a recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they offer security ) , but that they have become so large , so stiff , and so beset by critics and complexity as to have lost considerable influence and all the romance of their former connection to success . ( In Nixon 's Republican party there arc disparaging references to " The Eastern Establishment " which suggest that there might now be more than one ? meaning , of course , that there is none at all . ) Here is Francis T. P. Plimpton. the former Deputy U. S. Ambassador to the U. N. , and one of the finest representatives of the old style of WASP culture in America . A gentleman . a man of parts . From Who 's Who in America ( 1964.1965 ) : The style is responsible , worldly involvement , directing institutions which nourished and arbitrated the culture ; schools , universities , hospitals , the Council on Foreign Relations , the United Nations , the Church Peace Union . the missionary college in China , the Philharmonic . They were good institutions all , and many of them still do their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal courts , most of them are no longer sanctified as sources of social and cultural initiative , or even as mediators of conflict . There must have been a time when it was fun to he a university trustee . The interest and action tend to come from others . George Plimpton. the son of Francis T. P. and probably the best-known WASP dealer in living culture , operates like a Paris salonist among Interesting People ( Capote , Mailer , the Kennedys ) , writing brilliantly of his amateur involvement in The Real Stuff : fighting Archie Moore , playing quarterback for the Detroit Lions , pitching to the Yankees . ( All sports are now saturated with ethnics . ) It is a new role for the children of privilege . Is there a redeem . ing social utility in this work ? Had Plimpton been Jewish he might have played schlemiel in a jockstrap , but as an upper-class WASP perhaps all he can do is represent the man whose dreams of command have turned to fantasy and whose greatest moments of glory come from watching other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger to find out how it feels to be upward bound . Does the aspiring WASP hero have a choice other than that between Apollo and Paper Lion ? T he enervation of WASP culture may derive , more than anything , from a loss of place . The geographic and psychic worlds of the old mainstream become less distinct , but certain special neighborhoods , even if they are a generation away . survive as regions of the mind . The sense of place : Salem and Boston and Concord : Zenith and Winesburg ; Yoknapatawpha County . It produced people with accents and fashions and biases ? personalities ? that they carried around as overtly as parasols and walking sticks . And because they knew who they were . they were quite willing to he eccentric and crazy . Now much of that material is gone . The black ghetto still remains as a real place , and so does the memory , if not the fact , of South Boston , of Brooklyn , of rural Mississippi and small-town Texas . But how much of a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner sense of Bronxville or Winnetka ? Because WASPs regarded themselves as the proprietors of history and the managers of destiny , there was a double displacement . While they were losing their regions they also began to lose their special role as the intrinsic Americans . When we discovered that the country and the world were no longer easily manageable ? when we lost our innocence ? it was the WASP role which was most affected . No matter how enthusiastically the ethnics waved the flag , they had always been partial outsiders . ( Or perhaps better to say that they enjoyed dual citizenship . ) In any case , their culture never depended on the assurance that they were running the show . They were tenants , had learned to survive as minorities . Obviously this produced problems . but it also created the tensions and identities of which modern literature ( fur example ) is made . And these conditions of tenancy have n't yet been destroyed , may , indeed , have been strengthened through the mass media , which have nationalized isolated pockets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities , new constituencies : students , for example , and women . What kids or blacks du in one town is now immediately communicated to others . Normalcy does n't make good television , happenings do . The greatest effect of the melting pot , ironically . may not have been on immigrants and minorities , but on the mainstream . The vacuum left by the old arbiters of the single standard ? Establishment intellectuals , literary crit ics , English professors , museum directors , and all the rest ? has produced a sort of cultural prison break . And not only by ethnics , by blacks and Indians , or by kids , but by a lot of others , including all sorts of WASPs themselves . who behave as if they have been waiting for this freedom all their lives . That a lot of what results from this new breakout is had ( and who , these days , can get away with saying that ? ) , and that a lot will be transitory is hardly surprising . In a decade hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million amateurs entered the culture biz , and God knows how many gurus , cultists , swamis , and T-group trainers hung out their shingles . No one could expect most of them to be good , or perhaps even to be serious . The wildcatters are working new territory and a lot are going to go bust . But for the moment they 're thriving : the Stones and the Beatles , the groups and groupies , Polish Power and Black Studies , liberation schools and free universities , Norman Mailer 's ego and Alexander Portnoy 's mother . The Graduate and Alice 's Restaurant , rebellious nuns and protesting priests . Rat and Screw and a hundred other under . ground papers , mixed-media shows and the Living Theater , bookstores of the occult , Taro cards anc freaks and hipsters , miniskirts and maxi coats heads and joss sticks ... all coexisting ( barely , on easily ) with Lyndon Johnson 's cornpone . Normal Vincent Peale 's sermons , I Love Lucy . Reader ' , Digest . and Apollo 12 . If the 1960s produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eharaeteris tic instruments are the hand-held movie camera , th , electric guitar , and the mimeograph machine . am if its efforts survive in nothing else , they will un doubtedly be remembered by the greatest outpour ing of poster art in all history : peace doves and pa test proclamations , the face of John Lennon , th pregnant Girl Scout over the . motto " Be Prepared . and the pregnant black woman over the 1968 can paign slogan , " Nixon 's The One . " This is a con nte culture ? not high , not low or middle ? but eclecti . Until recently , when encounter groups , publi therapy , and other psychic ceremonies beeam fashionable , reason had been more or less sucecs fully keeping the dark night of the soul within ti hidden closets of the mind . And WASPs were tl most reasonable people of all . There were , obv ously , advantages in that .

Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we kept hot ma from taking charge . But their style did n't do mu ( for cultural enrichment . Now everything that graying , nervous civilization kept jammed in the closets is coining out , whether it deserves to not : sex in all forms , feelings , emotions . self-reve ' tion , and forms of religion and ritual long cc demned as superstition . " Honesty " replaces st , eism. and " love , " however understood , overwheli " work . " It may well be that the kids are mini McLuhan 's non-linear culture , that print and em reason ( and WASPsF will go under together . far there is no way of knowing . What is certain is that the old media ? books , newspapers , magazines ? can no longer claim a monopoly on urgent cultural articulation , and that people who work ihe new territories have moved a long way from the old mainstream . WASPs seem to have been crippled by their own sanity . They have become too levelheaded . Having confused their particular social order with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have defaulted on their birthright of cussedness and irreverence . " This took courage , this took prudence , this took stoutheartedness , " thinks Arthur Winner , Jr. , James Gould Cozzens ' hero , at the end of By Love Possessed . ( He has just covered up ? to his and Cozzens ' satisfaction ? some $200.000 worth of ledger-de-main perpetrated by one of his partners . ) " In this life we can not have everything for ourselves we might like to have .... Victory is not in reaching certainties or solving mysteries : victory is making do with uncertainties , in supporting mysteries . " WASPs are willing to be " sick " ? meaning that they can have their neuroses and their " reason " too ? but never crazy . People who are willing to be crazy are almost invariably Something Else . We no longer have , or seem to have the possibility of having , a figure like Bertrand Russell ; we no longer even have an Everett Dirkscn or a John L. Lewis . WASP crimes these days are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud ? which is why we are =o fascinated by Jimmy Hoffa . Roy Cohn , and the Mafia , why we need the Mafia , would have to invent it were we ever to suspect ( as has Daniel Bell ) that it does n't really exist . Heyoncl the formal institutions of business and IP government ? the banks . the corporations . the State Department , and Congress ? the unique provinces of WASP domination tend to be conservative ( in the pure sense ) and mediating , WASPS , I think , still regard themselves as the principal heirs of an estate in which the streams flowed clear . the air was clean , and the language pure . In the growing number of conservation societies , and in their almost exclusive dominion over libraries , dictionary-making , and I surprising as it may seem to those familiar with only the current " celebrities " in the profession I the teaching of English , they are trying to preserve some of that estate . But as " the environment " becomes a national issue , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) even as conservationists . There are going to be new men ? technicians , population planners , engineers ? who will move in on the Audubon Society , the Sierra Club , and the Izaak Walton League . The urban environment ( John Lindsay vs. the New York legislature and Nelson Rockefeller ) will demand parity with the environment of Daniel Boone and the bald eagle . On some issues urban and rural conservationists can make common cause , but on others ( mass transit , housing , street cleaning , and garbage collection ) they can not . But it would be unfortunate , perhaps even fatal , if the WASP 's mediating function I through courts and oilier institutions ) were also to be seriously eroded . It is inconceivable that America could ever be integrated on ethnic terms . Can one imagine this country as essentially Negro or Italian or Polish ; or believe that the Republican party would nominate anyone named Spiro Agnopopoulos for Vice President : or visualize a trial in which the defendant is white and all the other participants judge , jurors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , happen ? in the preliminary proceedings against the Klansmen charged with plotting to mur ? der Charles Evers , the black mayor of Fayette . Mississippi-1111t it may never happen again . ) For if the minorities no longer accept the new style of the mainstream , they are even further from accepting each other . And somebody is going to have to help keep them from tearing each other apart : cops and kids , blacks and blue-collar whites , freaks and squares . Robert Kennedy . I think , recognized this need before he was killed ( significantly by a crazy ethnic resenting Kennedy 's sympathy with other ethnics ) . This is also what made the reelection of John Lindsay possible ? and significant . The Jews and Negroes of New York may have distrusted him , but they trusted the Italians even less . Even mediation , however , is no longer feasible on the old standard rigid WASP terms . For the first time , any sort of settlement among competing group interests is going to have to do more than pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beliefs . and cultures . The various commissions on violence and urban riots struggled with that problem but could n't see beyond their assumptions to the logical conclusion . America is not on the verge of becoming two separate societies , one rich and white . the other poor and black . It is becoming , in all its dreams and anxieties . a nation of outsiders for whom no single style or ethic re ? mains possible . The Constitutional prohibition against an established state religion was adopted because the jeffersorlians understood the destructive consequences of imposing a single set of cultural beliefs beyond the guarantees of freedom and due process . The Establishment in America has . in part , lost its grip because it devoted itself too much to the management of its game . rather than to the necessary objective of making it possible for everyone to play his own . Minorities ? cultural , ethnic . even minorities of one ? are fighting over the wreck . age of the WASP-abandoned cities and the WASP-forsaken culture . If the WASP Establishment is to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a police state ? it will have to recognize the legitimacy of the contenders . One of the reasons that growing up in America is absurd and chaotic is that the current version of Americanization ? what the school people call socializing children ? has lost its appeal . We will now have to devise ways of recognizing and assessing the alternatives . The mainstream is running thin .
