THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IA:T Saturday , at seven o'clock in the evening , the nation , led by President Nixon , marked the end of the war in Indo-China with bell ringings , church services , and a moment of silence . The talk from official quarters was not merely of peace but of a generation of peace , as though we were ushering in a new golden age . But while we were ringing bells , and praying in silence , bombs were being loaded onto American planes on bases in Asia , and before the first twenty-four hours of the " peace " was over , we had flown over a hundred air strikes against targets in Laos and Camhodia . Far from there being a generation of peace , there was n't even ten minutes of peace . It left us wondering how many times the United States was to celebrate the end of the Indo-China war before the war ended . IN Vietnam , fighting also continued , J. but our troops and planes were mercifully nut of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generation of peace , an end to the American combat role is all that most of us ever really expected or asked for from this peace . This much has come  --  at least to Vietnam and it has come for the best of reasons . It has not come because of great-power diplomatic triumphs , nor has it come because the United States has attained its objectives in South Vietnam , and it has not conic , either , because the United States was defeated in Vietnam . It has come because the American people as a whole rejected this war and wanted it over . Millions of Americans simply loathed the war . They were of all ages and from all walks of life , and were by no means restricted to members of the peace movement . There were very few bellicose or enthusiastic supporters of the war . Most Americans , perhaps , tolerated it uneasily for a while , but many of them did so not because they believed in the war but because they believed in the government and the government said it knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the President . These people were put in the position of having to unlearn their trust in their leaders in order to learn the truth about the war . Millions learned that lesson . ? Vben it is all far behind us , it mar finally be decided that this was a war started by the government and ended by the people . But for the moment this fact is disguised . One reason is that the government took so many years to respond to the public 's signal . The public mood of disillusion with the war crystallized sometime around the spring of 1968 . Its political manifestation was President Johnson 's decision to limit the bombing , start the negotiations , and not run again for the Presidency . The stage seemed set for an end to the war Then the four-year delay began , and the strain it placed on our political system and on the public 's confidence in that system was so great as to constitute an entire fresh tragedy for the country . The public 's mood moved from disillusion with the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , one of the most striking signs of the general disillusion has been the refusal of a large portion of the public to believe that the war is ending even now . The willingness of these people to believe the announcement of the end of the war  --  or , probably , to believe any large piece of news  --  is one more casualty of the war . The people 's central role in ending the war has also been disguised by another unexpected peculiarity in the events of the last week : the President 's manner of presenting the peace to us . The people 's will was that we leave Vietnam . The President , when all is said and done , is the people 's instrument . In leaving Vietnam , he was doing the country 's bidding , and this is all as it should have been . But even as the President responded to the popular will in his actions , he seemed in his words to deny it and to he ashamed of it . He refused to acknowledge our rejection of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting the war , and assured us we were leaving now only because our aims had been achieved  --  because we had attained peace " with honor . " That is to hide our country 's light under a bushel . The American people were not steadfast in this cause , and it is a fine thing . We are actually leaving the war without attaining our war aims , and this is to our credit . It is too late for jubilation and congratulations- But hope is reborn with this peace . It lies not in the fact that we fought the war but in the fact that we are , finally , putting an end to it . THE thirty  --  sixth President , the late Lyndon Baines Johnson , was an absorbing study in contradictions large and often unbelievable ones . Those who lived through his Presidency still dwell almost entirely on his flaws , which were grave and numerous . He was sly  --  sometimes transparently , so . He seemed to lack all scruples against prevarication . He cared  --  genuinely and sometimes passionately  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a handful of them , whose number grew smaller over the years . He was an authentic patriot who also knew that patriotism is often the last refuge of a scoundrel , and his world was populated largely by scoundrels , some of whom he cared for deeply . He was a man of much hard-won knowledge but of slight formal education , and an awareness of this lack seemed to lie at the root of many of his feelings of inadequacy and also of his many misplaced feelings of awe for those whose heads were full of hook learning expensively acquired . He was a man of great shrewdness . He was a superb judge of the strengths and weaknesses of men who served with him and under him . It will someday come to light that his judgments were for the most part not only accurate but expressed in words uncannily appropriate to their subject , and sometimes very funny . He was a superb mime and anecdotalist . If there was ever a sounder judge of character in the White House , the biographers have yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , because Johnson himself went to some lengths to conceal it . His public pronouncements were , as a rule , banal , and this was probably just as well , because those that were natural to him were acidulous and at times tuu cruel to he transmitted to a world that could not be expected to savor his language or grasp the odd spirit behind it . Lyndon Johnson was undone , as was fitting , by the awful war in Vietnam . At least four Presidents can he held responsible for that disaster , but the judgment of history seems likely to be that he must bear the largest burden of guilt . A case could be made for having him share the honors with his successor , who carried the war to Cambodia and Laos , thus going beyond the limits that Johnson set . On the other hand , Richard Nixon extricated a half-million American men , and pursued a negotiated settlement that exceeded Johnson 's best efforts and is now apparently a success . It will be argued for years why this was so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire-builder , no gun-toting Texan . ( During a fierce hour in the battle , in 1967 , he said in a speech at Williamsburg , Virginia , " Shame on the world , and shame on its leaders .... We can take no pride in the fact that we have fought each other like animals , which ) is really an insult to the animals , who live- together in more harmony than human beings seem to be able to do . " ) The simplest explanation seems at present to be that he just moved in the direction that he thought John Kennedy wanted to take and that most of the hig-brain specialists told him he ought to take . This may be too simple , though ; the future may tell more . At any rate , he escalated with a vengeance , and , on that account , lost the confidence of most of his country and came to feel that he could no longer he of service to it . Yet this was when he had already been of immense service to his people  --  particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , while conducting the horrid business in Vietnam , put through the Congress more humane legislation than any other President in history , with the possible exception of the hero of his earlier days , Franklin D. Roosevelt . Cease-Fire N the United Nations , an organization that has consistently been pushed to the sidelines of the Indo-China conflict , delegates reacted to news of the cease-fire with a mixture of caution , detachment , and apathy . The figures who had dominated the last session of the General Assembly were either hack in their own capitals or holed up in their missions conferring with each other by telephone ; nearly all the ambassadors had sent second- or third-ranking colleagues to represent them in routine committee work . On the day the peace terms were announced , a Security Council committee discussed Resolution 253 on the Quesdon of Southern Rhodesia ( closed ) , a Working Group considered the International Sale of Goods ( open ) , and the Governing Economic and Social Council of the U.N . Development Programme looked over individual-country programs ( very closed ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular noon press conference , which permitted the U.N . ' s two press officers  --  William Powell and Andre . Lewin  --  to extract a suitable statement from the Secretary-General . Promptly at I P.M. , before a room overflowing with correspondents , Mr. Powell read a brief communique from Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim : " I am very gratified that this long and agonizing war , which has brought so much human suffering and destruction , is now at an end . .. " The assembled correspondents greeted it with a short period of silence . A man in the first row then asked if the U.N . had made any plans for the reconstruction of Vietnam . " We do not have any plans , " Mr. Powell replied . " So far , the U.N . has not been asked to take a role . Both sides have indicated , however , that they wish to have the S.-G. at the peace conference . " " Has there been a formal invitation to the S.-G. ? " another reporter asked . " Both North Vietnam and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend , " replied Mr. Powell . " This is a political conference , " said a lady with a French accent . " Does it encompass reconstruction ? And what could be expected at a political conference from the S.-G. ? " " I think this is a perfectly legitimate question that I ca n't answer , " said Mr. Powell , and the briefing broke up in a burst of well-mannered laughter . We walked down the boulevard-size second-floor corridor to the Delegates Lounge . Its big , curving bar was virtually deserted . A few groups of U.N . staff members were scattered about the enormous , high-ceilinged room , sipping ap  --  ritifs and engaging in low-voiced pre-leincheon conversation . A second secretary from one of the F'rench-speaking African countries passed by carrying two cups of steaming cappucino , and observed that the best news he 'd heard all day was that the espresso machine was back in operation . A Secretariat economist paused to greet us and remarked that Americans had been so brainwashed by heavy doses of Vietnam news that they tended to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vietnam as a political problem has always been outside the U.N. , which is why everybody here feels so helpless about it , " he said . " The relief problem is something else again ; they 're probably coming to grips with that on the thirty-eighth floor . But the one thing that we all noticed immediately is that the observer team is hardly neutral . The Canadians are kind of neo-Swedes , who want a great-power position without actually being a great power . The Poles and the Hungarians will parrot the Russian line . And the Indonesians , God knows , are the world 's most fir , t-ihie people . " We chatted briefly with Vergiliu Ionesco , of Rumania ( " We would be happy so see Indo-China as one country . As you know , we have supported the People 's Republic of Vietnam diplomatically and materially every step of the way " ) ; Kenneth Jamieson , of Great Britain ( " Oh , we 're all very pleased with this agreement , and I assume that it will lead to peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nip and tuck , has n't it ? " ) ; and Sinan Korle , United Nations Chief of Protocol ( " I hope it will be a lasting peace this time " ) . Then we sat down at one of the round teak coffee tables and " I do n't recall anyone asking me where I might prefer to sit . " shared a sandwich lunch with Kaj Sundhcrg , the No. 2 man at the Swedish Mission . " Of course , we are extremely happy about the cease-fire , because Vietnam is a subject that has exercised Swedish opinion to an unprecedented degree , " said Mr. Sundherg , a tall , aristocratic-looking man who speaks impeccable English . " I 'm sure you know that Prime Minister Palme made a speech that was widely misinterpreted in the United States , because of inadequate press reports . What he meant to do was paint a picture of the torture that human beings can be subject to in time of war . Ho was not comparing the United States to Nazi Germany . Sweden was very lucky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did experience the feeling of being a small and vulnerable nation . This has made us , perhaps , more understanding of the Vietnamese situation . We have had diplomatic relations with Hanoi for more than two years , we have sent them a good deal of humanitarian aid , and , of course , we expect to help with the reconstruction of the country after hostilities have ceased . The big question is : Will it be a lasting peace ? " ? WHEN the news came of the cease-fire agreement , we thought of David McReynolds . For a long time , since the days when few Americans knew there was a war in Indo-China ( and those who did know about it thought of it not as a war but as a " policy " ) , McReynolds had been working to bring it to an end . In 1961 , the year of the first American casualties in Vietnam , he joined the staff of the War Resisters League as field secretary , and he has since opposed the war every way but violently . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous opponents , and opponents who spent more time in jail or on television , but there were few who worked so hard and so consistently or who earned so much respect from all segments of an anti-war movement that was often bitterly divided . The night after the cease-fire was announced , we had dinner with McReynolds and Igal Roodenko , a past chairman of the War Resisters League , at Casey 's , in the Village . Roodenko , who went to prison during the Second World War as a conscientious objector , is tall and stout and has an enormous gray beard and gray eyes . McReynolds , who is in his early forties , is even taller and thin , and his heard is neatly trimmed . True to his heritage ( four of his ancestors came over on the Mayflower ) , he is dour- - as incurably dour as Roodenko is incurably jolly . Food and wine were ordered , and McReynolds announced , " I 'm hung over , but I 'm hungry all the same . I watched Nixon 's speech on television last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and much more besides . I 'm sorry , hut , damn it , it has been twelve years . " Roodenko smiled beatifically . McReynolds frowned . " If you had told me in 1961 or 1962 that we would still be fighting in ' 72 , I would never have believed it , because the war was so cruel and so pointless even then , " McReynolds said . " In a purely political , pragmatic sense , it 's astonishing how wrong the experts  --  the supposed best minds in the country  --  turned out to be . Back in 1964 , A J. Muste and I wrote a memo pointing out that Vietnam was a genuine analogue of Yugoslavia  --  that the regime of Ho was a natural counterpoint to China , an independent buffer . The experts were locked into a kind of unexamined ideology that prevented them from seeing this . What bothers me more , though , is that none of them ever publicly resigned over the war  --  not McGeorge Bundy , not Robert McNamara , not even Adlai Stevenson . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Cabinet officer but an official of the Rand Corporation , none of them stood up and said , ' This war is morally wrong . ' " We asked McReynolds what he thought would become of the peace movement , and he said , " I think the Vietnam groups will collapse very quickly , the way smeF  --  the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy  --  did after the test-ban treaty was signed . But the League will continue , and it may even grow , as it did after the Korean war ended . Amnesty will be a major project for us , and though Americans , thank God , wo n't he fighting in Vietnam , the underlying problems of an unrestrained Presidency and a huge military establishment remain . Because the Vietnam war went on longer than it was supposed to , it educated us  --  it showed millions of people what American foreign policy was all about . The interventions in Lebanon and the Dominican Republic ended so quickly that it was easy to dismiss them as aberrations , but Vietnam did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind of people  --  a people whose courage could n't be programmed into a computer ! ' " What concerns me now , though , is the vast bulk of people who will be caught between the two sides , " Roodenko said . " Hanoi will take care of its people and Saigon will take care . of its people . But the little people in the middle , the ones who do n't care about . Communism or capitalism  --  there is no one to take care of them . It 's true that the war in Vietnam was an outgrowth of American history and character , but so is the anti-war movement . There is a great tradition in America of independence of judgment and resistance to tyranny . The peace movement 's problem was that it did n't really know how to address itself to it . " " The problem that we pacifists have to face is that the war is ending less because of our nonviolent activities than because of the armed resistance of the Vietnamese , " McReynolds said . " All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face arrest repeatedly . If we do n't recognize that , then we have missed our lesson from this war . " Roodenko smiled fondly at McReynolds . " Dave , " he said , " you have an almost congenital Waspish habit of selling yourself short . " McReynolds smiled , and frowned , and shook his head . ? THE clay after the President 's speech , the guys in Kilroy 's Cafe , on Sixth Avenue , were watching Lyndon Johnson 's funeral procession on the TV and talking about things . Kilroy 's is the kind of place where the ) post the prices of the drinks over the bar . Steam tables up front , but not very many people go there to eat , Beer on tap : Rhcingold , Schaefer , Ballantine , Piels . Also Ballantine Ale . A guy named Jimmy was talking to a barkeep named Tommy about the retirement of Gump Vorsley , star goalie of the Minnesota North Stars and ex-New York Ranger star goalie . " You could always count on Gump , " said Jimmy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Brooklyn . He wore a three-piece gray plaid suit , short in the sleeves . Jimmy glanced up at the TV . " I appreciated where the President mentioned Johnson in his speech last night , " he said . " What did you think of that treaty ? " Tomm ) asked him . " I can live with it , " Jimmy said . " A lot of these people do n't realize how hard it is to get out of a war . You ca n't just pull out . Say you got a milk bottle . Now , if I asked you to fill that milk bottle with cotton , you could do that in ten minutes . But , now , if I asked you to take that cotton out , you 'd need some time . " Tommy nodded . A man wearing a blue quilted work jacket and Levi 's approached the bar . " Hey , what about the market ? " he said . Jimmy and Tommy looked blank . " The stock market , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thumb first up , then down . " It dropped fourteen points , " Tommy said . " I win my bet , " said the man in Levi 's . Jimmy ordered a ham-and-cheddar , FEBRUARY 3 , 19 7 3 and Tommy walked off . " How do you figure ? " Jimmy asked the man . " It 's this peace treaty . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm all for peace , but it 's had for business . Even a rag is worth more in wartime . " " Oh , yeah , right , " said Jimmy . " Sure . " They both started watching the TV . Two men at the far end of the bar were talking about the weather . " I was wearing a light jacket down at the Battery yesterday , " said one . " The wind damn near killed me . " Tommy returned with Jimmy 's sandwich . A man in a beige car coat entered and took a stool next to Jimmy . " Hi , Jimmy , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , Fred ? " he said . Fred grinned . " Lemme have a peace with honor to go , " he said . " Hold the honor . " Hundredth . Anniversary IE , TTER from a friend , a working journalist in Boston : " The Harvard Crimson celebrated its hundredth anniversary this past weekend with a cocktail party , a panel discussion , and a big dinner party at the Harvard Club of Boston , and I went to the dinner , because this was the first reunion I 've ever felt like attending . I was at Harvard in the early sixties , and did n't like it all that much , so I spent all my time at the Crimson . If I 'd gone to Harvard a few years later , maybe I would have just left school , but in my day no one had the imagination to think of dropping out . The result was that I enjoyed my years in Cambridge and graduated from college actually equipped to earn a living , because the Crimson , although entirely an extracurricular activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm still in the business , and when I sat down to dinner , I was n't very surprised to find out that of the nine other people at the table six were working journalists like myself and only two were lawyers ( and neither one was digging being a lawyer all that much ) . Crimson training is that good . The ninth guy , Bob Wagner , Jr. , ' 65 , is running for the City Council in your town . " The dinner was on Saturday night , and Saturday afternoon I went out to Cambridge and stopped in at the Crimson building , at 14 Plympton Street -- the first time I had done that in a long time . It 's the same building I remember  --  mock-Georgian , two-story-plusbasement . The A.P . machine was in the THE NEW YORKER same spot , still clanking out stories about the day 's potato prices , and there was still the rack of black-hound ledgers called ' comment hooks , ' in which Crimson staffers were still subjecting their paper and their world to rigorous examiiiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to be called by his initials and to write in the comment books and sign his initials , and the initialled comments I saw reflected the same convictions I used to feel  --  that putting out the Crimson is a very serious business , and that the buck stops on the managing editor 's desk . " The main change in the Crimson as a social institution , I was told , is that there arc no more all-night stands . This is the result of ( I ) the paper 's having gone offset , meaning early deadlines and a printing press in Arlington , far enough away not to exert any romantic and irresistible charm ; and ( 2 ) the total triumph of coeducation , meaning that people have better things to do after midnight . Maybe they even get better grades . " At the dinner , there were tributes to Miss Fickett ( Eunice Fickett ) , the lovely woman who has been the paper 's bookkeeper and secretary for at least a dozen years , God help her , and to Caldwell Titconah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music scholar and who lives in the area and has written in the comment hooks regularly ever since with the aim of trying to instill the difference between ' that ' and ' which . ' He is the only person in Greater Boston who in the final third of the twentieth century maintains this ancient knowledge . " The scene of the dinner was the great hall of the Harvard Club , a vast room that for some reason looks more weather-beaten on the inside than the club does on the outside . The room was entirely filled . Four hundred and fifty-five people were there . The food was reminiscently collegiate  --  there was an argument at our table as to whether the soup was lobster bisque or cream of mushroom . The atmosphere was just very good . There were seven speakers  --  one representing each of the last seven decades of the paper  --  and although their speeches were , of course , too long , you got the feeling that all seven decades had found the Crimson a memorable and a shaping experience . David Halberstam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , the biggest name . He spoke quite nicely about how the Crimson had taught his generation not to have too much awe of people in high places . The speeches that stuck in my mind , though , were speeches by Linda J. Greenhouse , ' 68 , and James M. Fallows , ' 70 , executives of the paper during Harvard 's great period of unrest  --  a time when the Crimson was subjected to the most bitter kind of criticism by elements of the faculty and alumni who thought the- paper was siding with the students who were occupying buildings , at the expense of the administration who had called in the cops to throw them out . " Greenhouse said that it was probably hard for the old grads who had criticized the Crimson for a lack of objectivity in its reporting of the events of the late sixties to realize that , for the first time , students were being perceived as enemies by a large part of the country , and even by a large part of the university administration . In those circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were covering a session of the Cambridge City Council or a change in course requirements in the Philosophy Department . " Fallows said that now , when he thought about it , he had to admit that the paper had been an irritant at that time  --  but only because the truth of what had been happening was very upsetting . ' Mr. Halberstam spoke a few minutes ago about learning a lack of awe , ' Fallows said . ' Well , saying we learned a lack of awe is like saying Spiro Agnew overcame shyness in the White House . It was like a sense of awe was not the biggest trouble we had to overcome . We did keep the Crimson strong , and were not afraid of being an irritant . I think the only thing I regret is that we were occasionally excessively cautious , and inclined to think that if those who were rtinning the institution were upset , this was a sign that something was wrong , I hate to end this succession of seven generations or seven decades as the voice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I am almost uniquely qualified , since , as far as I can tell , I am the only member of my class who is not in law school or medical school or graduate school but is simply trying to earn a living by working as a journalist . And , if any of you are upset , the Crimson is still basically as it was when you were here , and still doing as well as it did . ' "
