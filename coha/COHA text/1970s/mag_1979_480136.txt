ON JUNE 26 , America 's top arms-trade official , Lt. Gen. Ernest Graves of the Defense Security Assistance Agency , met with industry representatives in Washington , D.C. , to discuss the Middle East . The breakfast , sponsored by the American Defense Preparedness Association ( a lobby for U.S. defense contractors ) , was billed as a dialogue on " the latest issues and problems in the foreign military sales arena . " Obviously this topic commanded a following in the defense community , because by 7:15 A.M. the Georgetown Room of Marriott 's Key Bridge Motel was filled with executives representing the nation 's largest arms producers . After thanking these officials for braving long gas lines ( then at their peak in Washington ) , Graves told his audience what it most wanted to hear : that despite the debacle in Iran , Washington had no intention of cutting back on arms exports to the Middle East . " The theme I have to convey to you , " Graves told the attentive executives , " is that today arms transfers continue to constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is easy to understand why so many industry officials turned up for Graves 's presentation . For six years Iran had proved a bonanza for American arms producers In his haste to create the Middle East 's most powerful arsenal , Shah Muhammad Riza Pahlevi had ordered $19 billion worth of U.S. arms between 1973 and 1978 , and had brought in American defense contractors to help modernize his military forces . And this was to be just the beginning : in August , 1978. the Michael T. Klare is a Fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington , D.C. , and author of War Without End : American Planning for the Next Vietnams . He is currently completing a book on the international arms trade . shah gave the White House a new shopping list with an additional $15 billion in arms requests , and began negotiating for the purchase of still other weapons not yet off the drawing boards . It all must have seemed like an arms merchant 's dream conic true ? but the euphoria died abruptly . On January 16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran 's new rulers announced that all outstanding arms orders would be canceled . The shah 's departure , and the subsequent cancellation of $12 billion in Iranian arms purchases , obviously shocked the U.S. defense industry . Not only were American firms left holding billions of dollars worth of half-completed weapons , but they faced the loss of many more billions in future sales . Moreover , sales to other countries were jeopardized because the discount prices once permitted by large Iranian orders had to be abandoned . And added to this there was the frightening spectacle of 10,000 U.S. military technicians ? employed as advisers on Iranian arms projects ? being forced to leave the country on mass-evacuation flights . I F THE SHAH 'S DEPARTURE produced only gloom in the U.S. defense community , it should have provided at least some relief for President Carter . As a candidate , Mr. Carter had criticized the Iranian arms program and pledged to reduce U.S. military sales abroad . At one point , he condemned those U.S. officials ? no names were mentioned , but the reference to Henry Kissinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business on the cynical ground that by rationing out the means of violence we can somehow control the world 's violence . " Upon entering the White House , he proclaimed a " policy of arms restraint " to reduce U.S. military exports to non-NATO nations . Scarcely had the new policy been announced , however , when Mr. Carter felt compelled to override his own restrictions in order to push through several major arms deals negotiated by Presidents Nixon and Ford . Under pressure from the State and Defense departments , Carter authorized the sale of seven sophisticated radar patrol planes to Iran , and of 200 jet fighters to Israel , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia . Because of these and other controversial transactions , U.S. arms exports rose by 20 percent during the first two years of the Carter Administration ? leading some critics to denounce the President in much the same language that Carter once used to denounce Kissinger . The Iranian cancellations offered Mr. Carter a chance to recover his If arms restraint " policy . But Mr. Carter as President discovered something that had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming arms sales have created special interests in both government and industry that can close ranks to block any reduction in military exports . This bloc can enlist the support of Congressmen representing districts with major defense industries , as well as economic officials worried about the growing decline in America 's overseas trade balance . Added to these concerns was the fear voiced by some diplomatists that developments in Iran , Ethiopia , and Afghanistan have created an " arc of instability " in the Middle East that invites Soviet intervention unless Washington takes action to strengthen pro-U.S. governments . Unable to counter these pressures , Mr. Carter overlooked his earlier promises and agreed to seek new buyers to compensate for the loss of the market in Iran . Mr. Carter acted expeditiously to offset any risk of decline in military exports . First , he ordered the Pentagon to buy back some of the arms already in production for Iran . Next , he sent General Graves and Defense Secretary Harold Brown to the Middle East to find new customers for the remaining equipment on the order books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package for Egypt and Israel that began a new boom in the defense industry . Thus , by the time Graves met with U.S. arms executives in June , he could assure them that military exports would remain at record levels despite the Iranian cancellations . Any hope of salvaging Carter 's arms restraint policy has apparently disappeared forever . " What we are seeing , " Sen. William Proxmire ( D.-Wisc. ) said recently , " is a return to that old state of mind . In peace or during periods of tension , weapons are the answer . " Even critics like Senator Proxmire agree , however , that President Carter was sincere in his commitment to reduced arms sales . How , then , was this commitment shattered ? To answer this question . it is necessary to review the consequences of arms sales to Iran . p RIOR TO 1972 , U.S. sales to Iran under the Pentagon 's Foreign Military Sales program rarely exceeded $100 million per year . Then in 1973 the shah presented the first of what became a series of billion-dollar " shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped from $473 million in 1972 to $2.2 billion in 1973 , and then soared to $4.3 billion a year later . Iranian spending remained at the $2-billion level over the next two years , then shot up again in 1977 to a record $5.7 billion . All told , the shah ordered $19.5 billion worth of U.S. arms between 1972 and 1978 . One U.S. Congressman has called it " the most rapid buildup of military power under peacetime conditions of any nation in the history of the world . " Not only did the shah order large quantities of U.S. arms , but he also selected America 's most sophisticated weapons . The shah 's preference for technical and expensive equipment was evident in his aircraft purchases . ( " Some men take Playboy to bed , " an American familiar with the Imperial Palace once observed . " The shah takes Aviation Week &; Space Technol. ogy . " ) In 1972 , he ordered 169 Northrop F-5E supersonic fighters and 108 McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers at a combined cost of more than $1 billion . Next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters armed with Phoenix guided missiles , jointly considered the deadliest airborne weapon in the U.S. arsenal . Deliveries of these aircraft had scarcely begun when , in 1977 , he ordered 160 General Dynamics F-16 air combat planes ? a weapon specifically designed for NATO forces ? plus the seven surveillance planes . And even these prodigious orders did not sate the shah 's appetite for advanced jets : in 1978 he presented the White House with still more orders , which reportedly included 70 F-14s , 140 more F-16s , 31 late-model F-4s armed with Strike guided missiles , and 15 Boeing 707 and 747 transports for use as aerial tankers . These orders . if fulfilled , would have given the shah the fourth or fifth most powerful air force in the world . T HIS SPECTACULAR INCREASE in the quantity and quality of arms sold to the shah was the result of a decision made by President Nixon in 1969 to convert Iran into a surrogate police power in the Persian Gulf . Britain , which had previously served as the guardian of Western interests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer perform this mission ; and since the United States was too encumbered in Vietnam to assume this role itself , Nixon decided , on the basis of a study submitted by Henry Kissinger , that a local power would have to du the job . At this point the shah ? who had always hoped to establish Iranian dominion in the Gulf ? volunteered his country for the necessary peace-keeping roles . In return for steady infusions of U.S. arms , Iran would henceforth serve as the - guardian and protector " of the West 's oil supplies . The U.S.-Iranian partnership was confirmed in May , 1972 , when Nixon and Kissinger flew to Teheran and offered the shah his choice of America 's advanced weaponry . In approvingthese arms sales , Nixon was motivated largely by strategic considerations : If Teheran was to serve as the American surrogate in the Persian Gulf , it obviously needed modern weapons . But then came the OPEC price increase of 1974 , and Washington discovered new motives for boosting U.S. sales to Iran : to reduce deficits in U.S. balance-of-payments accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to generate income for the depressed aerospace industry . Nixon rapidly lifted remaining restraints on military exports to Iran , and encouraged American arms firms to sell their wares to the shah . The stampede to Teheran was on , as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee noted in a 1976 report on military sales to Iran : The 1972 sales derision , coupled with the increase in Iranian revenues following the quadrupling of oil prices , created a situation nut unlike that bees swarming around a pot of honey . De . fense industries . both US and foreign , rushed to Iran to persuade the government to procure their products . The resulting hoom in arms transfers to Iran had unforeseen consequences . To begin with , the shah lacked sufficient trained personnel to operate and maintain the lavish gear he was importing from the West , and so had to recruit thousands of foreign technicians to manage the Iranian war machine ? thus arousing the hostility of Iranians , both military and civilian , who felt that their culture was being subverted by Western values . In their rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " cut corners " by providing substantial bribes to Iranian procurement officials ? thereby fostering corruption and undermining the royal family , which was directly implicated in some of the more conspicuous " kickback " schemes . Finally , by failing to curb his passion for expensive weapons once Iranian oil revenues began to drop in 1975 , the shah boosted inflation and reduced social spending ? thus antagonizing those lower- and middle-class Iranians who suffered a decline in their standard of living . This economic resentment combined with religious animosities to spark the revolution of 1978-79 . If the shah can be said to have become addicted to the import of arms , then it is no less true that his suppliTHE ARMS OVERSTOCK ers became addicted to the export of arms . Sustained by steadily rising Iranian orders , U.S. arms exports rose from $500 million per year in the Fifties and Sixties to an average of $15 billion in the late Seventies . As a result , many firms that once worked exclusively for the Department of Defense ? like Northrop ? now find that 50 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , in turn , means that jobs ? an estimated 350,000 of them ? and thus the economic well-being of many American communities , have become dependent on military exports . At the same time , other camp followers have become attracted to the arms caravan : the Treasury Department naturally seeks to recover as many petrodollars as possible from Middle Eastern uil producers ; the Commerce Department seeks to improve the U.S. economy through increased export sales ; the State Department seeks to improve relations with emerging military powers abroad ; and the Defense Department seeks to lower its own weapons costs by shifting some of the expense for research and development to foreign buyers . Having grown accustomed to yearly export sales of $15 billion , it became almost impossible for these interests to contemplate any reduction in U.S. military sales . As Rep. Gerry Studds ( D.-Mass. ) observed in 1978 : " The forces arrayed against any effort by any President to turn around a policy of such force gild such long standing as U.S. armssales policy are truly awesome . " ' When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House was not how far U.S. exports could be reduced , but how to fill the enormous vacuum created by the loss of America 's number one arms customer . The problem divided into three parts : first , what to do with the weapons in production ; second , where to find buyers for all the other weapons ordered by Iran ; and third , how to compensate for the loss of future sales to Iran . A fourth , somewhat conflicting aspect of the problem arose later : what to do with the advanced arms delivered to Iran prior to 1979 and now , lacking spare parts and skilled maintenance , rusting away in Iranian arsenals . The first of these problems proved relatively simple to solve . The Iranian government had made substantial pitgress payments on all work underway as of December , 1978 , so no company was actually holding the hag for money spent on half-completed weapons . In accordance with U.S. sales procedures , the Iranians had deposited $500 million in the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund to cover such contingencies . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , " one Pentagon official said in Felltuary , " no American company is going to go under " as a result of the Iranian revolution . As originally conceived , the purpose of the trust fund is to assure an orderly stopping of work on canceled arms programs . Rather than cancel the Iranian programs , however , the White House decided to use these funds to continue work on some projects in the expectation of finding other buyers for the completed items . In February , President Carter asked Congress to approve a supplemental defense appropriation of $765 million to permit the military to buy some of the Iranian merchandise for its own use . In particular , Mr. Carter proposed that the Navy purchase two of the four Spruance-class destroyers under construction at Litton 's Pascagoula , Mississippi , shipyards for a total cost of $750 million ? far less than it would cost to build new ones from scratch . Although some Congressional leaders hailed the move as an opportunity to acquire additional warships at what appeared to be bargain-basement prices , others doubted the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shah 's specifications and would thus need extensive ? and expensive ? modifications to meet U.S. standards . Having resolved the immediate problem of disposing of the ships already in production , the Administration turned its attention to the problem of lining up new customers for all the other equipment ordered by Iran . This task coalesced with the Administration 's third objective : finding customers for all the future orders no longer forthcoming from Iran . Rather than write these orders off the books altogether , which would have resulted in a substantial and prolonged decline in U.S. military exports . Mr. Carter ordered the Defense Department to find substitute buyers . As the first step in this campaign , Secretary Brown and General Graves were sentto the Middle East in February with orders to dispose of as much of the canceled Iranian merchandise as possible . B Row/Y 's TRIP ? the first ever undertaken by a U.S. Secretary of Defense to the Middle East ? was nut officially described as an arms-trade mission . Ostensibly , his task was to reassure pro-Western governments that the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shah . But in each of the four countries ( Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Israel . and Egypt ) they visited , Brown and Graves met with military officials to discuss future arms transactions . This aspect of their travels was rarely mentioned in public , but on one iiotable occasion Brown delivered an unabashed advertisement for U.S. arms : speaking before Saudi air and military cadets , he proclaimed that " we can provide the best training and eqinipment in the world . We will do so . " Brown followed up on this offer in meetings with Saudi defense officials . Saudi Arabia already has some $15 billion in outstanding orders ? mostly for construction work on air and naval facilities and for sixty E-15 fighters ordered in 1978 ? and its capacity to absorb additional weaponry is considered limited ; nevertheless , Brown reportedly negotiated sales of additional guided missiles ( to arm the E-15s and other U.S. aircraft in the Saudi inventory ) and of infantry supplies and technical support for the fast-growing Saudi Arabian National Guard , the kingdom 's principal internal security force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting that total Saudi orders in 1979 should equal or surpass the $4.1 billion recorded in 1978 . While in Riyadh , Brown also worked out details of the U.S.-Saudi plan to provide North Yemen with U.S. arms . The North Yemenis , who are closely allied with Saudi Arabia , have periodically been attacked by South Yemen , whose Marxist leaders are allied with Moscow ( both Yemens border Saudi Arabia on the south ) . Under the agreement worked out by Brown , the Saudis will provide $390 million to cover the transfer to North Yemen of twelve Northrop E-5E fighters , two Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo planes , sixty-four Chrysler M-60 tanks , and 100 armored carriers . Brown also agreed to preivide technical assistance to the inexperienced Yemenis in operating this material . In accordance with the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 , the Yemen package should have been submitted to Congress for review , and possible veto . In late February , however , South Yemen forces invaded and occupied several North Yemen towns along the two countries ' disputed border , prompting Mr. Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to bypass Congressional review . The President 's tactics were praised by some in Congress who thought that a " show of force " was needed to demonstrate U.S. determination to block any Soviet attempt to exploit the instabilities created by the Iranian revolution , but were criticized by others who argued that the Yemen crisis did not warrant such preemptory action ? particularly since the two Yemens had agreed , on the eve of Mr. Carter 's action , to respect a cease-fire negotiated by the Arab League . On March 15 , Rep. Leon Panetta of California introduced a concurrent resolution protesting the President 's plan on the grounds that " this action denies to the Congress an opportunity to examine all relevant facts in the Yemen war and to determine whether making this kind of major new commitment to North Yemen is in the best interests of the nation . " The Yemen deal was not the only new commitment Brown made while in Riyadh . In another package to he funded by the Saudis , he agreed to supply Sudan with twelve F-5E fighters and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting in neighboring Ethiopia and worried about possible interference by Libya , which has been implicated in two recent coup attempts , had long requested U.S. military assistance . Presumably the $140-million F-5E package will be followed by other Saudi-financed arms transfers . Brown also agreed to provide additional arms to Oman , which lies astride the strategic Strait of Hormuz , through which most oil tankers pass on their way to the West . Like other conservative Arab monarchs , Oman 's Sultan Qaboos was deeply shaken by the revolution in Iran ( which faces Oman from across the narrow strait ) , and he reportedly requested from U.S. officials small arms and internal security material . Neither Yemen , the Sudan , nor Oman is likely to grow into a major military market on the scale of Iran , but each is confronted with domestic and international threats and thus will have an escalating need for modern weapons . And while none of these countries has traditionally been considered a close ally of the United States , U.S. determination to export weapons to the Middle East will probably result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pro-U.S. leaders in all three could be replaced by radical Muslim forces . F OLLOWINC HIS VISIT to Saudi Arabia , Brown flew to Jordan , Israel , and Egypt --  each of which requested additional U.S. arms . Brown reportedly told leaders of these countries that any action on these requests would have to await completion of the thenpending Mideast peace treaty , but suggested that Washington would be sympathetic to all reasonable requests . While in Jerusalem , however , he solved one of the remaining problems from the Iranian crisis : what to do with the fifty-five General Dynamics F-16 fighters that had already entered production when the shah fled in January . Since the Israelis are also scheduled to receive F-16s ? but not , under the original production plan , until 1983 ? Brown worked out a deal whereby Israel will receive the first installment on its order from the Iranian batch of fifty-five . ( By canceling its F-16 order , Iran 's revolutionary government , which has come out strongly in support of the PLO and the hard-line Arab states , will , ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of Brown 's conversations in Jerusalem and Cairo focused , however , on how these countries will spend the money they would receive in conjunction with the peace accord . Although the treaty itself had not been fully written yet , Brown indicated which weapons the United States would make available once the treaty was signed and ratified . As finally announced in April , the deal includes $2.2 billion in arms credits for Israeland another $1.5 billion worth for Egypt , plus a grant of $800 million to Israel to help finance the relocation of two air bases from the Sinai to the Negev . ( These funds , it should be noted , are in addition to the $1 ? $2 billion per year in military aid already committed to these countries . ) Although most Congressional leaders applauded Mr. Carter 's negotiation of the peace treaty , support for the arms sales was less than unanimous . Some critics said that the transfer of still more weapons to the Middle East would only encourage a new arms race ( fears that were given added credibility in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compensate for the latest Israeli acquisitions ) , and thus increase the killing in any future wars . " This is not like throwing a lighted match into a gasoline tank , " Senator Proxmire observed in May , " but it is like adding more gasoline to a tank that has exploded in flaming destruction over and over in the past few years . " However welcome the treaty , he added , " the payment should not include a new round of the arms race in the Middle East dressed as the dove of peace . " D ESPITE SUCH CRITICISM , the arms sales easily won Congressional approval when submitted to a vote in May . Neither Israel nor Egypt has fully indicated how they will spend these additional credits , but their general pref. erences are well known . Israel seeks seventy-five more F-16s , advanced air-to-air missiles , tanks and armored carriers , and surveillance gear to warn of any impending Arab attack . Egypt wants combat gear ? including tanks , supersonic fighters , armored carriers , submarines , and destroyers . ( In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first treaty funds to buy 800 armored personnel carriers , 200 M-60 tanks , and 200 self-propelled 155-mm howitzers , and Egypt will receive 35 F-4E Phantom fighter-bombers , 750 armored carriers , and other military vehicles . ) The $4.5-billion treaty package represents just the beginning of what are expected to be multimillion-dollar arms-modernization programs by Israel and Egypt . Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman last year gave Brown a $12-billion arms request known as Matmon-C Woman is the Hebrew word for " treasure " ) . President Sadat requested weapons costing $8 billion when Brown visited Egypt in February . Neither country is likely to get everything it wants ( Egypt , for instance , is not likely to receive any offensive arms that will threaten Israel ) , but both will prove steady customers of U.S. weapons suppliers . There is also talk in Washington of converting Egypt into a " substitute surrogate " in the Middle East , to perform the peacekeeping duties once assumed by Iran . ( According to reporters who accompanied Brown on his Middle East journey , President Sadat himself proposed such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while U.S. officials deny that any such plan is under consideration , the White House reportedly has agreed to provide Sadat with counterinsurgency gear and other equipment suitable for police operations in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula . The Egypt-Israeli arms agreements , coupled with promises of future deals , pulled the U.S. arms industry out of its post-Iran depression . Most producers report that despite the loss of their Iranian programs , business is as brisk as ever . " When you look at the $25 billion E-161 program we have now , " a spokesman for General Dynamics remarked , the canceled sale to Iran " is not a very significant matter . " And some analysts have suggested that Egypt 's requirement for U.S. arms may eventually outstrip Iran 's . As one aerospace official told Dan Morgan of the Washington Post in April : " The beauty of this is that Iran is a drop in the bucket " compared to the Middle East market as a whole . All this is not to suggest that Mr. Carter rushed through the peace treaty solely to rescue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling reasons for pushing the accords to completion ? not the least of which was a desire to restore some peace and security to the Middle East following the upheaval in Iran . But it is also clear that U.S. plans to enlist both Israel and Egypt in future efforts to stabilize the region will require a continuing supply of American arms , assuring steady business for U.S. producers . With the task of finding alternative markets for all the weapons once des tined for Iran now largely completed , U.S. officials could turn to the remaining problem : what to do with all the arms sold to the shah prior to his departure in January . LTHOUGH THE SHAH 'S successors have attempted to keep their less sophisticated arms in working condition , many of the elaborate weapons are rusting in Iranian hangars and depots . Deputy Premier Abbas Amir Entezam reported in March , for instance , that 95 percent of Iran 's 900 helicopters are permanently grounded . Lacking the spare parts and trained personnel to put these machines back into operation , Iran 's new leaders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of F-14 fighters ? back to the United States . But while some U.S. officials have suggested that the Department of Defense use this opportunity to augment its own arsenals at discount prices , the weapons industry has resisted the scheme because it would reduce the Pentagon 's future needs for these items and thus undermine the companies ' long-term profitability . Given the political clout of these arms firms , it- is doubtful that the buy-back scheme will ever be implemented . If the Iranian government fails to find foreign customers for its surplus arms , it will have only two choices : either turn the arsenal into scrap metal , or recruit a new corps of foreign technicians to help put them back in working condition . The import of foreigners will clearly provoke hostility from Iran 's conservative Muslim leaders , who had attacked the shah for opening up their country to Western values and influence . But it now appears that the military is willing to risk such opposition to rescue their " American weapons from the scrap heap . Aviation Week reported in July that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eighty technicians to Iran to supervise the repair of RF-53 and SH-3D helicopters in the Iranian inventory . If this plan succeeds , it is likely that the Iranian military will negotiate such arrangements with other U.S. companies once involved in Iranian arms programs . ( Recent fighting between the pro-government forces and the autonomy-seeking Kurds has ap parently strengthened the position of those Iranian officials who believe that some sort of continuing arms relationship with the United States is essential . ) The arrival of U.S. technicians in Iran , if and when such a plan is approved , will represent a new chapter in the U.S.-Iranian arms relationship . But while it is doubtful that Iran will again become a major customer for U.S. arms , such arrangements demonstrate how hard it is to completely sever ties once a country has become accustomed to receiving a steady supply of modern arms . ( The Egyptians , who broke their ties with the Soviet Union in 1974 , have encountered much the same problem . ) The only way out of this dependency is to purchase arms from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inefficiency ? or to break the " arms habit " altogether . Such action naturally contradicts all the imperatives of " national security " as we have been taught to know them , but on the other hand , Iran demonstrates how the steady accumulation of modern arms diminished , rather than enhanced , the stability of the imperial government . As one U.S. official who witnessed the Iranian upheaval said in February , F-145 and F.-15s wo n't solve the social , political . and economic problems " that constitute the greatest threat to regional stability in the Middle East . And if America 's overseas military customers might benefit from a reduction in arms spending , the United States might also ask whether it stands to gain from such a change . True , any significant cutbacks in military exports will probably cause dislocations in the arms industry , but this would force these companies to produce other , non-military goods that can attract a more stable market . Furthermore , by restricting the export of arms to shaky governments in the Middle East , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , all countries stand to gain from . a slackening of the Middle East arms race . if , as Senator Proxmire has suggested . sending more U.S. arms is akin to " adding more gasoline " to that volatile tank , common sense counsels us to begin emptying the tank rather than flooding it even further .
