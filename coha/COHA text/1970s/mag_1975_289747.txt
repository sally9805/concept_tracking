While the debate over antirecession policy will continue , the Administration has all but decided on its basic approach to a closely related problem : reducing the U.S. 's dependence on costly imported oil . At Vail , Colo. , President Ford and his advisers just about buried two widely discussed options . Though many of the advisers favor an increase in gasoline taxes because of its simplicity , none have been able to sell it to Ford , who is apparently opposed to measures that would affect a huge group of consumers-in this case , motorists . Partly for that reason , Ford has also ruled out World War II-style gas rationing . <P> Another apparent casualty of the Colorado talks was an arbitrary ceiling on imports of foreign oil , which is now flowing into the U.S. at a rate of 7.3 million bbl. a day . The experts found that such a limit not only would bring back the long lines at the gas pumps but would worsen the current economic downturn . Administration predictions show that a " cap " holding oil imports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25 billion out of the gross national product and add upward of 400,000 to the unemployment rolls within a year . <P> Basically , what emerged from Vail was a general agreement within the Administration to deal with the imports problem through a market approach . In essence , that means reliance on higher oil prices to encourage both a reduction in consumption and a sharp step-up in efforts to develop new domestic sources of crude oil . A rise in prices would be achieved in part through a removal of controls on the cost of domestic crude oil . But the main tool of the emerging Ford program would be excise taxes paid by oil companies on all natural gas and crude oil refined in the U.S. White House advocates of such a tax are persuaded that it would not actually discourage production , since companies would pass most of the increase in their costs on to consumers in the form of higher retail fuel costs . The assumption is that those higher prices would encourage users to conserve energy . <P> The political difficulty is that an excise tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could decide to debate the matter into 1976 . Thus the White House is considering kicking off its energy-conservation program with a stop-gap tariff on oil imports that Ford could impose by Executive order . The Administration 's program would unfold in three stages : <P> IMPORT TARIFF . Citing a national security clause in the 1962 Trade Expansion Act , Ford could slap a tariff of $1 to $3 per bbl. on already costly foreign oil . Most of that oil goes to the Northeastern states , where it heats 30% of the homes and fuels 90% of the oil-fired generating plants . To ease the economic impact on those states , the Administration would spread the higher crude-oil costs around the country through the current equalization program . In effect , Western refineries with easy access to " old " domestic oil , selling at a controlled price of $5.25 per bbl. , would subsidize Eastern refineries that are dependent on uncontrolled oil from foreign sources or " new " domestic oil-production in excess of a 1972 base period that is allowed to sell at the world price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a nationwide rise in gas prices of 3 or 4 per gal . at the pump .
