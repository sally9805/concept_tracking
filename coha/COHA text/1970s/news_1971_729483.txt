txt The impression grows among war critics that North Vietnam may be less obdurate on peace terms in Southeast Asia . If this indeed is so , it is still communicating its views to the wrong parties , according to White House officials . That a new Hanoi peace propaganda offensive is under way is indisputable . It is undoubtedly timed to have maximum impact on congressional debate on setting a date for complete United States withdrawal from Vietnam . In one 24-hour period , the capital heard . ? Former Defense Secretary Clark M. Clifford say he had " reason to believe " that if the U.S. named a withdrawal date the North Vietnamese would reciprocate by releasing American POWs within 30 days . ? Rep. Robert L. Leggett ( D ) of California insists that Viet Cong negotiators in Paris had promised him that if such a date were set they would release all their American prisoners " before that date . " ? Chalmers M. Roberts , veteran Washington Post foreign-affairs specialist , reports that the top North Vietnamese representative in Paris said in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American withdrawal , could be settled even if the Thieu-Ky regime stays in power , though Hanoi would object to continued U.S. arms support for such a government . December date resisted The first reaction of the administration was that the above stories were not what the North Vietnamese were riling the American negotiators in Paris . Even if the Hanoi delegation at Paris does communicate some combination of the Clifford-Leggett-Roberts formulas to U.S. representatives , there is little expectation President Nixon will soon budge from his refusal to set any withdrawal date . White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler characterizes the Dec. 31 date set in the Hatfield-McGovern amendment as " precipitous . " From the administration 's standpoint , the Vietnamese Government is not yet stable enough to stand on its own feet . The October elections in South Vietnam , the administration hopes , will result in both a strong and popular government in Saigon . // *Hanoi 's peace offensive // The administration sees progress in its Vietnamization program , but is fearful of risking a pullout of all U.S. military support before 1972 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement " in Vietnam that frustrates the Democratic opposition . i The 1972 schedule for bringing U.S. forces at least down to a 50,000 level is felt by most Democrats to be dictated by presidential-year politics . Amendment modified For months , many Democrats have conceded that if U.S. casualties are drastically reduced by election time , the war ( for which both parties have shared a responsibility in three presidential administrations ) would not be a large issue . Many Democrats , and some liberal Republicans , however , are convinced also that American lives will be needlessly lost between now and late 1972 . They do not expect the Saigon government to be in more attractive form or militarily secure beyond what it is today . Then comes the Washington Post interview with Xuan Thuy , chief of the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris . Though Xuan Thuy stepped back from earlier insistence that the Thieu-Key regime be ousted , he nevertheless indicated Hanoi would not go along with continued U.S. arms support of Saigon after U.S. forces are withdrawn . The Nixon administration would not go along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. keeping military forces in Thailand and for the U.S. Navy to stay offshore , as long as there were no further attacks against Vietnam .
