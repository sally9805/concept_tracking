txt The Senate , by a one-vote margin , gave final Congressional approval today to legislation aimed at saving the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation from bankruptcy . The bill , passed by the Senate by a vote of 49 to 48 , was identical to the one passed by the House on , Friday night by a three-vote margin , 192 to 189 . The measure thus goes directly to President Nixon , who hailed the Senate action today as one that was " in the best interests of all the people . " The legislation would permit the Government to guarantee up to $250-million in bank loans to any corporation whose failure would " seriously and adversely " affect the national economy or that of any ' region . Throughout the long debate on the issue , Administration spokesmen made clear their expectation that the entire $250-million would bt used to shore up Lockheea . Any other corporation that wanted similar help from the Government would have to go to Congress for specific approval of an additional loanguarantee authority . Mechanically , guarantees of the loans to Lockheed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is created under the legislation . The members of the board are the Secretary of the Treasury , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Cornmission . The Senate roll-call on the bill was dramatic and the outcome was in doubt until almost the last minute . The tally stood at 48 to 48 at the end of the normal call , first of the full list of Senators and then of all those present in the chamber who had not voted on the first round . Vice President Agnew was in the presiding officer 's chair , ready to cast the tie-breaking vote if needed . But then Senator Marlow W. Cook , Republican of Kentucky , entered the chamber and asked for recognition . When he voted " aye , " it was all over . ? Senate Democrats split 31 to 22 against the Lockheed loan guarantee and Senate . Republicans split 27 to 17 in ? favot . The Republican showing was not a very strong one for a bill urgently sought by a Republican Administration . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liberals and conservatives from both parties voted on both sides . All of the announced and presumed candidates for the 1972 Democratic Presidential nomination voted against the // Lockheed loan guarantee with one exception  --  Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota . When he cast his " aye " vote , there were some hisses from one section of the public galleries that contained a group of tourists of mixed ages . Vice President Agnew had to warn those in the galleries that " expressions of approval or disapproval " were not permitted . Three Senators did not vote . Senator Karl E. Mundt , Republican of South Dakota , is still seriously ill following a stroke . Senator Lloyd M. Bentson , Democrat of Texas , in an unusual action for a member of Congress , disqualified himself on the ground that he was a former director of Lockheed . The absence of Senator Henry M. Jackson , Democrat of Washington , was unexplained . " He had strongly supported an earlier version of the bill , which ' would have authorized a total ' of $2-billion in loan guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerospace contractor , the Boeing Company , is located in Washington State . Enactment ' of ? the , legislation means that the consortium of 24 large banks that have previously gotten together to make loans to Lockheed will shortly begin supplying the company with additional funds it needs to meet its payroll and other costs . Lockheed has said that it needs the money to stay in business until it starts taking in some cash from the sale of its new 400 - passenger jet transport , the L-1011 Tristan Those who opposed the loan guarantees had contended , among other things , that Lockheed would probably never sell enough of these planes to break even on them and that the company might be back asking for still further Government assistance at some future date . The argument was also widely made that the company had such a bad record as a defense contractor ? producing planes and weapons only at costs greatly exceeding its original bids  --  that it ought to be allowed to die . The majority in the Senate took the other side of the arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as many as 60,000 persons employed by Lockheed and its subcontractors would be thrown out of work if the company went bankrupt . The one pattern in the rollcall was that Senators with Lockheed installations or the plants of subcontractors in their states voted for the legislation . Those with plants in their states of the Douglas Corporation , makers of the DC-1D , which would be the principal competitor of the Tristar , voted against the Lockheed bill , as did those with plants in their state of the General Electric Company , which makes the engines for the DC-10.
