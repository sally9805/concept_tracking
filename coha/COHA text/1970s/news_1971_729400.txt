txt The 1972 presidential election , as seen from inside the White House , may not hinge so much on spectacular issues as on broad confidence , or lack of it , in Richard M. Nixon as a leader . Will the public like the " direction " Mr. Nixon has moved in the Vietnam war , the Supreme Court , the economy , the kinds and qualities of people appointed ? This election-day criterion is forecast in at least one influential segment of the Nixon entourage . Here is how the reasoning goes : The question of presidential leadership can not be answered in terms of what legislation was passed or not . It has to be measured in terms of direction that the President takes the country in its thinking about fundamental problems . For example , the whole national dpbate about problems in the cities , about the federal and state and local relationships , has shifted from a sort of vague discontent and ailnless groping to a very focused debate on Mr. Nixon 's revenue-sharing proposals . A rather remarkable consensus has developed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooked ? and that is that the federal programs relating to localities do n't work very well . // *Nixon in ' 72 : Tone may upstage issues // This has now been admitted by all kinds of people who would not ordinarily have been expected to come forward with that sort of admission . It 's an admission against interest , ellect , because you get a lot of people from the late Johnson days and the late Kennedy days who were **25;370;TOOLONG people who are coming forward and saying yes , I guess some of these do n't work too well , maybe we ought to have block qrants , maybe we ought to hive something else . It is of great significance that the debate is on the President 's ground . It is not a debate on somebody else 's ground to which he has been brought . This is evidence of leadership that is generally overlooked , Difficult days ahead The foregoing view from the White House is , of course , to a degree a recognition of the extremely difficult days ahead for the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress is trying to wrest the initiative from Mr. Nixon in almost every area where he has recommended reform . If they are united , they have the votes to do it , and in that sense they could steal a march on Mr. Nixon . It is recognition of this that leads some in the White House , both for pragmatic and strategic reasons , to start to think in terms of overall leadership image rather than legislative monuments . There is , however , no giving up at this point on Mr. ' Nixon 's more cherished legislative endeavors . In fact , there is more confidence than one would expect . Revenue-sharing prospects The thinking of this one White House source continues : Revenue sharing has a good chance either this yeaV or at least before the life of the present Cpgress expires next year . Some of the special revenue-sharing programs have received a better reception than others . Manpower revenue sharing has been temporarily dumped by parliamentary maneuver . Law-enforcement and rural revenue sharing ( once the Appalachian item is passed ) will go ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Education is very complex . It is probably the slowest in the bunch . And general revenue sharing is not as dead as the newspapers indicate . A strong heart beat is detected . Continuing the White House view : The Nixon health-insurance program is going to get early hearings . The cUrrent hunch is that nothing will happen in Congress this year . Next year , though . . . But next year , maybe in the middle of the session , some results may be seen . Congress may not end up precisely with the Nixon solution . In the debate , however , the United Automobile Workers-Kennedy approach has been put in context . Its very fundamental shortcomings have been pointed out and the Nixon-initiated debate has made strong contribution to getting a solution Welfare-reform legislation will bated in the House shortly . The should have welfare reform in five or months . Reorganization of the Cabinet departments will be approved , in part . The long-run implications are enormous . The above is the mood and judgment in one area of the White House in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informational aid to both friends and foes of the administration .
