txt ON MONDAY night , the Des Plaines City Council probably will approve an ordinance banning carryout purchasing of alcoholic beverages by persons under 21 . Sum an action follows in the wake of almost identical legislation recently passed overwhelmingly by the Chicago City Council . The Cook County Board is considering even more stringent legislation that would hike the legal drinking age in the county 's unincorporated areas to 21 . " The tide is clearly turning , " says State Sen. Frank Ozinga R. , Evergreen Park , whose most recent legislation to hike the drinking age statewide to 21 was narrowly defeated in the state Senate . " All the momentum is with us now . " INDEED , THE once firm conviction that a youth who is old enough to fight and die for his country is old enough to drink has gone flabby . Since legislation was passed five years ago permitting 19- and 20-year-olds to drink beer and wine , more than a dozen area suburbs have exercised their home rule option and either eliminated or restricted the drinking rights of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance was proposed because many teen-age problems  --  traffic accidents , vandalism , rowdyism and public drunkenness  --  appear to be exacerbated by area youths having legal access to beer and wine . In addition , he said , schools report a tremendous increase in problems related to alcohol on the high school and junior high school levels . " WHAT SEEMS to be happening is the 19-year-olds are passing it on to the 18- and 17-year-olds who ace in turn passing it on to the 16- and15-year-olds and , in turn , it 's down in the junior high schools , " Kisslinger said . Ald. Fred Roti 1st , chairman of the Chicago City Council 's license committee , said early reports indicate that the city 's new ordinance has curbed some of the more obvious problems connected with teen-age drinking , particularly in the parks . But Roti said that the option to consid // Rampant abuse perils teens ' drinking rights . // er a complete ban on drinking by persons under 21 will be examined in six months , and " if it 's needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Calumet City , which opposed the lowering of the drinking age from the start and went to court ' to defend their home rule option not to lower the age , Des Plaines did n't contemplate action until recently . " WE FELT that such a step by one isolated conuntutity does n't have much effect , " Kisslinger said . ' , , But after Chicago moved , we decided maybe it was time to get after the problem . " Still , we 're taking it one step at the time . If it were really meaningful , we might go the whole way . But if it just means kids jumping in their car and going to Mt . Prospect or Arlington Heights , as it does now , it 's meaningless . " However , it 's hardly meaningless for communities unable ' to exercise the home rule option adjacent ' to ones that have . Sgt. John Murray of the Alsip Police Dept. says there has been a steady stream of teen-agers flocking from Chicago into the tiny community on weekend nights to buy liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , juveniles are loitering around liquor stores and keeping order is taxing the 27-man police force . " Sure we 've been able to keep It under control so far , but I do n't know how long we 'll be able to donate the manpower and put in the overtime to keep it so , " Murray said One suburban official complained that with so many communities taking some action , teenagers need a " liquor map " to determine where they can drink and buy , where they can just drink , and where they can do neither . " What we have now just does n't make sense , " says Roll . " We need uniformity instead of having this piecemeal , town by town , city by city approach . " - STATE SEN . Dawn Clark Netsch ID. , , Chicago ) ; who.has supported the current drinking age , concedes that uniformity of drinking laws in an an area should be ? a high priority . Despite some claims and expert testimony that there have been 33 per cent more traffic accidents involving teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sure a correlation can be proved . ? : " But I would like to look at the whole problem again since if there 's any demonstrated relationship ; we ought ' to rethink the whole thing , " she said . " Still , nobody has ever proved to me that raising the age to 21 is going to keep people under 21 from drinking or keep them from drinking and driving . " It just produces more devious ways of going about it . " NEVERTHELESS . Netsch agrees with strong proponents of the change like Ozinga that the current messy situation will exert additional pressure on the General Assembly during the next session . Ozinga , whose last bill failed in the Senate by two votes a similar bill in the House did not get out of casnmitteel is convinced the grass robts activity to hike the drinking age will force the General Assembly to reassess its position . " Once you 've got the big cities recognizing the problem , you 've got the ballgame , " he said . " I plan to prefile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up support on both sides of the aisle . " I think this time we 'll pass it pretty much unanimously . "
