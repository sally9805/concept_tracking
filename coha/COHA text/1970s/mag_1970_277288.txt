Come June 1 , 1971 , that familiar friend , The Saturday Evening Post , will be back on the newsstands . Or so says Beurt SerVaas , an Indiana publisher who has bought up most of the stock of the old Curtis Publishing Co . The new magazine will even look like the old Post , carrying the original logo . And just as before , it will be published in Philadelphia 's Independence Square . <P> SerVaas , now president of Curtis , points out that the Post still gets so much mail that three employees are needed to take care of it ; he believes that it " never really died in the minds of the public . " The new-old Post , he says , " will be a patriotic magazine , as I consider Benjamin Franklin* to have been a patriot . We will advocate change by evolution . " <P> SerVaas adds : " The Post will represent Middle America , but not in the Agnew sense . It will be neither sophisticated nor blase . " In other words , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Norman Rockwell put it , " kindness , sympathy , nostalgia and optimism . " Rockwell , 76 , has been enlisted to do the first cover of the revived Post . What the subject will be is still undecided . <P> Age of Specialization . The Post will be quarterly , and Curtis will publish 500,000 copies , to be sold only at newsstands . Then , if all goes well , it will go bimonthly , then monthly . The estimated cost per run is " several hundred thousand dollars . " It will sell for " not less than a dollar , and probably not too much more . " SerVaas figures that the price will cover production costs ; advertising revenue will be gravy . <P> The editor is still to be chosen , but of those being considered , none was connected with the old Post . Many of the contributors will be former Post writers , but according to SerVaas , articles will also be written by college students " and perhaps some drop-outs . " Reaction to the Post 's rebirth has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until its demise , Otto Friedrich , declared : " A quarterly dedicated to the past with covers by Norman Rockwell does n't seem very promising . " Pete Martin , one of the old Post 's most popular mainstays , took another tack . " In an age of specialization , I see a place for the Post-as a specialized magazine appealing to people between 40 and 70 . " <P> <P> * Who founded the Post , sort of .
