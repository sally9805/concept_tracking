txt Jimmy Zwicker , carrying the scars of combat , has come home from the war , in shackles . When he came in on Flight 103 of Pan American World Airways to Kennedy Airport in New York at 4:20 P.M. on Dec. 15 , James K. Zwicker , 25 years old , was completing an agonizing five-year journey of disillusionment , fear , anger and despair that has trapped him and thousands of other young men like him today . It was ? a journey that led from a quiet town in New Hampshire into war and a military hospital and , finally , into exile half a world away from home . A Familiar Story Jimmy Zwicker , Navy hospital corpsman , is a deserter . Now he has voluntarily returned to the United States to look for the broken thread of his life . Although it may differ in detail , his story is cut from a pattern made familiar by years of involvement in an unpopular war . Desertion has reached epidemic proportions in the later years of the war , and some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad for . ever or coming home to jail . Since 1967 , when 40,227 men deserted from the military , the number has steadily grown . During the fiscal year of 1971 , which ended last June 30 , a , total of 98,324 men at some time were listed as absent without permission for more than 30 days and were classified as deserters . Through that fiveyear period , a total of 354,112 young men had deserted from the service . Many of them , as the military explains , eventually returned to service , but as of this week 10 per cent of them , or 35,259 , were still at large . The rate of desertion surpasses that of any recent war . At the peak year of World War 11 , 72.9 men per 1,000 in uniform were deserting . Last year the number of deserters per 1,000 men in service had reached 142.2 . The year Jimmy Zwicker 's name was added to that list1968-53,351 other young men made the same decision . Each of those decisions , like the vibrations of a tuning fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service buddies , friends back home and the family . Amnesty Issue Growing And as the hopes for an end to the war rise , pressure increases on the Government to decide how it will deal with the thousands of young men who now face criminal charges , or are serving sentences , for refusing to take part in this war . Amnesty , or repatriation for the exiles , appears likely to become a major political issue in the months to come , with some Presidential contenders already urging some form of amnesty . Because his case is still unclear  --  desertion is an administrative matter and may or may not lead to actual prosecution in a military court-martial  --  and because he is confused and uncertain , Corpsman Zwicker will not talk about his experience as he waits in the Navy brig at the Brooklyn Navy Base . But his family agreed to tell his story , in part because his father , Kenneth F. Zwicker , is assistant publisher of The Keene ( N.H , ) Sentinel , and instinctively reacts to the news value of the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll help him , and help us , and help a lot of other families who have gone through the same thing . " Kenneth Zwicker , 51 , has gone through a number of changes in attitude in recent years , A veteran of combat with United States Marines in World War II , lie began to doubt , and then oppose , the war in Vietnam after a visit there in 1967 . " It seems , " he says now , " a stupid , senseless and wasteful war . " Through the experiences of his son , he has come to relexamine the attitude toward deIserters taught him by the Marines , " From my Marine days . my instinct is that a deserter is a person who bugs out , lets his buddies down , " Mr. Zwicker explains . " I guess it would be , harder if Jimmy had n't enlisted , if he had n't seen combat , if lie had n't been wounded . He 's been there . He 's seen it . He deserted from a hospital bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , Marilyn , his brother and four sisters  --  argued with him about volunteering for service . He had graduated from Keene High School and spent an unsatisfying semester in college , when , in January , 1966 , he enlisted . " He had always been a loner , artistic , " his father said , " He wrote poetry and such and always opposed the war , but he could n't stand the thought of waiting around for the draft , " Traces Change In Son Leafing through a folder of pictures and letters , Mr. Zwicker traced the transformation of his son . At the top of the pile is the high school annual . The picture looks like Robert Wagner from a nineteen-fifties movie ; slacks , loafers , sweater , close-trimmed hair and a flashing smile . Pictures accompanying letters from boot camp at Great Lakes , Ill. ; in corpsman school at Camp Lejeune , N.C. ; embarkation station at Camp Pendleton , Calif. , and the combat zone near Penang , South Vietnam , record the change . Jimmy 's unit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in an operation called Allen Brook . Two weeks later the family received a letter from Triples General Hospital in Honolulu . On May 17 , it said , Jimmy had been hit in the face and legs by shrapnel in an action that had decimated his outfit . " It 's plainly inhumane , senseless , valueless , pointless and , ridiculous seeing 18-year-old guys turned into chopped , unidentifiable meat , " he wrote from the hospital , " And the crying and the echo of confusion , the mortally wounded crying to be taken out of there , screaming and pleading for the bird to land , asking you when the choppers will get there and begging you to somehow land when they ca n't . " And you , lying to them as they die , telling them the choppers are on their way when they 're not ; telling him he 's going to make it and to hang on , when you know he is n't " Then , in a telephone conversation , Jimmy told his father the doctors said he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost touch for three weeks , until one night some college friends of Jimmy 's dropped by the house and , inadvertently , mentioned something called the " Jimmy Freedom Fund . " " I pressed them about it , " Mr. Zwicker said , " and they told me a lot of Jimmy 's friends had been in touch with bins and were helping raise money so he could split . He had gotten to Alaska and was going to Sweden . He would have nothing more to do with the war , " Last Contact With Son His last contact with his son was a phone conversation in June , 1968 , from Alaska . " I told him he was at the point of an important decision , a turning point , " Mr. Zwicker recalls , " I sent him some money and told him he could take it and go back , or go to Sweden . I No one could make the decision for him . But , whatever he did I would sympathize and undertend . God , my heart was bleeding for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Later , Mr. Zwicker learned how close to home the " Jimmy Freedom Fund " had come . Through that time , he recalled later , his 13-year-old daughter , Susan , was always busy on a " school project . " " She pestered me for files from the newspaper on the United Nations , Federal , state and county laws , and , finally , my passport , " he remembers . Much later he learned that Susan had been researching the laws on desertion and exile for her brother . All the children , some high school and college friends , and some strangers had become involved in his flight . Periodic contact during his years In exile painted a picture for the family of a young man alternately excited about the future or depressed with loneliness . Though he mastered the language in Sweden , Jimmy could never land a permanent , satisfying job . He apparently developed no close relationships and avoided the growing community of politically active American exiles . From those who knew young Zwicker in Sweden a picture emerges of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beliefs , but who was unable to create a life for himself in a strange , alien setting , " That feeling that you have just struck a blow for conscience gets knocked out of you pretty quick here , and there are a lot , like Jimmy , who would like to go back if they were n't afraid of what they 'd have to face back home , " said one deserter with whom Jimmy lived in his final days in exile . The deserter , who does not want his name used , discussed Jimmy 's existence in Sweden over the telephone . Shuns Other Exiles Except for a girl friend , with whom he lived for about a year , Jimmy Zwicker had never seemed able to relate to others . He avoided the political group of exiles except to attend meet . ings on Wednesdays to discuss common problems . All the while , his friend said , Jimmy became more and more lonely and depressed . He never talked about the future or even his past . " He was getting into the mystic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never messed around with drugs or alcohol , but he was always talking about Dante 's Inferno , Hindu religion , spells and such . He kept turning in on himself . When he and his girl split up he became very depressed ? she seemed to be the only real and stable thing for him here and when they broke up it really got to him , " Jimmy 's spiral ' down inside himself and away from any contact with his friends kept getting worse , his friend said , and lie had attempted suicide just over a month ago . " Then one day he said he was going home , " his friend recalled . " He said living alone , In a strange place , was like living in prison and if he was going to be locked up It might las well be back home . And then , he said , ' Then , I can go back up into the woods at home and just find something to hang onto . ' " Struggles With Decision For the last three weeks Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exile meetings on Wednesday to rap about it , " his friend said , " and the guys there would put the political argument on him . They would condemn him for thinking only of himself and not of the others who were in the same boat . That he was copping out . That he had no right to give up . Then lie would come back and brood and talk about his loneliness . " Finally , Jimmy called his father and told him he was coming home . The day he left , he was all " psyched up , " Jimmy 's friend said . " He was like a cat , Really afraid of what he would face when he got home . But I told him nothing could be worse than what he was going through . He had given up on life . The war and the pressure of his decision not to go back , the running , the strangeness and loneliness in a new country and his inability to relate to other people were ' just too much . He needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , I told him , go home . He deserves a hell of a lot better of his country . " Mr. Zwicker said of his son 's exile : " He just never seemed to find himself . He was lonely and the country remained strange to him . Then , without warning , two weeks ago he called and said he was coming home . " We checked with the em4 bassy and learned that he had been in no legal trouble . He just walked in and said he wanted to come home . He seemed awfully depressed , confused and bothered by his experience . " Now they all wait for the Navy 's decision whether to prosecute or to process Corpsman Zwicker for an administrative discharge  --  a route increasingly followed by all branches of the service with the growing number of deserters , Father Is Hopeful Mr. Zwicker , who has been Impressed by the Navy 's expressed concern for the family 's feelings , is hopeful : " It would be an awful waste to put him in jail , He imposed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a sensitive and tal- : ented person who 's been through a lot . It would be a shame to lock him up and not have the benefit of his talent and energy and experience on the outside . " As Mr. Zwicker talked of . these years of anxiety , he glanced across the room at his : other son , Kurt , 20 , and shook his head slowly , " When we got back from the visit with Jimmy last Friday , " he said , " we found a letter for : Kurt ? he 'd just been classified 1-A for the draft , "
