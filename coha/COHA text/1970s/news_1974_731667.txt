txt The House Rules Committee today blocked , for the rest of the Congressional session , floor . consideration of omnibus legislation intended to restructure the securities market , to end fixed brokerage commission rates and to strengthen the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission . The . 8-to-6 vote against send . ing file measure to the flobr virtually foreclosed the possibility of action at the current ' session . ? Clearance and passage of the bill at this session had been requested by the White House , the Treasury Department and the Justice Department , as well as the S.E.C. It was apparent before the vote refusing a rule on the bill that a majority of the panel resented being called upon to act on the complex legislation so late in the session . It was also evident that the lobbying efforts of the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities Industry Association had been effective , Both organizations concentrated their fire on the bill 's provisions calling for an end of fixed commission rates next May I. Committee members said they had been urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure from going to the floor and warned by letter and personal contact that passage of the bill would mean an end ' of the auction market and stock exchange trading . Representative John E. Moss Following today 's vote , two alternative courses remain . ' One would circumvent the ' rules panel and take the bill before the House under a ' suspension of the rules  --  a risky procedure requiring a two-thirds vote . The other would require , the intervention . of the Speaker . to request the rules , panel ' to reconsider its action  --  a course usually reserved for " emergency " legislation . In the vote on the rule , five of the committee 's 10 Democratic members joined , with three Republicans to provide , a majority against ' cletfring the bill for floor action . One Democratic member , Representative John Young of Texas , voted present . " Bombshell Exploded Recorded in favor of giving the House a chance to vote on the omnibus reform measure were four Democrats and two Republicans . Most members of the rules group appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not work any hardship on small broker-dealers operating outside Netv York City and it seemed the majority would give it a green light on the way to the floor . But just before the voting , Representative Richard Bolling , Democrat of Missouri and a senior member of the panel , exploded his bombshell . After remaining silent during the discussion of the measure , Mr. Bolling suddenly announced with some agitation that it would be a mistake to'send the House such major legislation so late in the session . It was " time for this oommittee to close up shop ' and refuse clearance rules on all bills " except those that the leadership of the House ' clearly labels as emergency bills , " Mr. Bolling said . The current lameduck session was losing more members daily and it had been his experience that more mistakes were made in the last tWo weeks of a legislative session than at any other time , he said . Chairman Ray J. Madden of Indiana tried to quell the ensuing shouts of " I 'm hungry " and " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had talked only this morning with . Speaker Carl Albert , wile " said he wanted the Securities ? bill and others of this list considered and cleared . " Mr.-Bolling had held his fire until , almost ** after the lunch break for most committeemen , and they seemed in a mood to kick over the traces . Clearance Refused How much of the impatience was due to the 11th-hour request for . action and how much was a pretext for sustaining the lobbying efforts of the S.LA. and the Big Board was conjectural , but the result was the same as if the-merits were entirely on the side ' of the lobbyist . While observers for the White House and the S.E.C. looked on , the committee voted , 9 to 6 , to refuse a rule clearing the proposed Surface Transportation Act ' of 1974 that would have provided $2-billion in federally guaranteed loans for the nation 's railroads to increase trackage and increase ' their freight car fleet . The Securities Reform Bill Went the same route after Mr. Madden ruled that the " Ayes have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rolling 's ' demand for a record tally . The American Stock Exchange , meanwhile , was carrying its fight against the scheduled switch to fully negotiated brokerage rates to a hearing before the S.E.C. The chairman , Paul Kolton , warned that ending fixed rates under present conditions of the securities industry could cause the stock exchanges to atrphy and bring an end to the : duction market process . If the exchange system falters under the impact of negotiated rates , Mr. Kolton said , " we will have turned away from the most uniquely successful securities market mechanism that has ever been developed . " But to judge from the tenor of questions from S.E.C. members , there is no present ? intention to deviate from the May 1 deadline on ending fixed rates . Rate-Fixing ' Outmoded ' Commissioner John Evans suggested that the rate-fixing mechanism long applied to the securities industry was " outmoded , " especially in regard to institutional traders who have been able to use their economic power to force lower rates . Commissioner Philip Loomis similarly remarked that he believed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breached by institutions to the point where it was ne longer effective . Another witness , Raymond J. Saulnier , said competitive or negotiated rates would be costly to individual , investors . Dr. Saulnier is professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University and a public governor of the Amex. // of , California , chairman of the Subcommittee on antmerce and Finance , which originated the bill , sought to defuse this opposition by reminding mernbers that the S.E.C. ' was determined to end fixed commission rates next May 1 whitever disposition was made of the bill by the committee .. Opposition Acknowledged In response to Representative James J. Delaney , Demotrat of New York , Mr. Moss , acknowledged that the bill was opposed by many members of the 131g Board , In. a voice : trembling with emotion , the subcommittee chairman charged that the exchange had opposed the bill , with the rules panel , " in violation of a solemn pledge:by its chairman James J. Needham that he would not try to-bldck clearance of the bill in this committee . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
