txt Does NASA mean it ? Mercury is breathing down the necks of Western Europe 's space scientists . They will have to be as quick as the legendary Olympic messenger if they want to put instruments on board America 's first spacecraft to Mercury , the planet . NASA plans to send this Mariner craft to Mercury by swinging it past Venus in 1973 . But last month it gave would-be scientific hitchhikers only until May 25 to submit proposals . While European planetary experts are hard at work on these , they despair of making the . deadline . They remember a similar short notice last summer for proposals for equipment to be carried to the surface of Mars by Viking soft-landing craft . Those proposals were so hurriedly conceived and prepared that none of them were accepted . Intrigued by overtures from Washington to share in American space efforts , European scientists wonder if NASA really means it when it gives such short notice on its stringent deadlines . Decades work in weeks British biochemists are compressing 10 years ' work into a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going after enzymes  --  natural catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions hundreds of thousands , even millions of times . You may have met them in new enzyme detergents . Here , certain enzymes help get out stains by breaking down protein in the stains into more soluble materials . But these particular ' enzymes are fairly cheap and easy to produce . Drs . Peter Dunnill and Malcolm Lilly at University College , London , are after certain enzymes in microbial cells which aid protein build-up . There are 20 of them and they are hard to separate from hundreds of other enzymes microbes make and use . Laboratory workers can get such enzymes one at a time in small amounts . But when a research team wanted to study all 20 , it figured it would take 10 years just to extract them one at a time . Drs . Dunnill and Lilly thought they could devise a process to get out all 20 at once . Industrial chemists said this kind of thing could n't be done . Nevertheless , Drs . Dunnill and Lilly now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints at future processes which may make a wide range of enzyme catalysts available for industrial uses . Grass ' research push The Nixon administration is more than doubling money for research into whether " grass " ? marijuana  --  really is greener on the other side of the psychedelic fence . An extra $1 million is being allotted to the National Institutes of Mental Health for hurry-up research contracts on marijuana 's effects and dangers . That brings the total for fiscal year ending June 30 to $1.75 million . There are four major objectives : ? To determine the consequences of long-range human use of marijuana . ? To learn the effects on driving and other skilled acts . ? To accelerate pharmacological studies on the drug 's properties , toxicity , and biological effects . ? To accelerate production of marijuana of known genetic background and purity for research purposes . Foreign countries where marijuana and hashish have long been in use will be prime sites for studies of chronic use effects . About $260,000 is being allocated and possible locales are Latin America , Greece , India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boosts maize Improving yield and protein content of common grains such as wheat and maize is a major worldwide project . CIMMYT ( Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo ) , located in Mexico City , is the center for this work . CIMMYT does basic research to develop improved strains , and sends the new seeds to other countries . There further development takes place to meet local conditions . In Mexico the program boosted wheat yields from about 1,000 kilograms per hectare in 1950 to more than 2,700 today . In Pakistan the yield improved from 750 kilograms per hectare in 1956 to nearly 1,400 today . Now CIMMYT expects to produce even greater improvements in protein yield of maize under a new program made possible by a United Nations grant . Aim is to develop a high lysine ( important amino acid food constituent ) content in maize for use globally . Over three years the program is expected to increase protein content from 8 percent to 14 percent , and the lysine content from a present 0.8 percent to 2.5 percent .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
