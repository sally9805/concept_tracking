LOSS OF MEMORY IS ONLY TEMPORARY NLY A STONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT up the wait- ing room of a psychiatric clinic as a place to meet for lunch . To make sure , at least , that nobody would think she was a patient , Naomi 's aunt wore a certain blue flowered outfit with velvet trim , which , from years before , she was used to taking out only for the High Holidays or sometimes funerals . These clothes turned out to be not a good idea : sitting by herself in the empty light of a fall day , they brought back the beginnings of years that looked no better backwards than forwards . Luckily , there was nobody watching . At the Reception Desk , the two Puerto Rican secretaries did not once look up , but went on drinking coffee from big paper cups . With their curly heads close together , they typed and giggled , giggled and typed , so that between the quick bells of their typewriters and the ringings of different phones , all they seemed to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical bird calls . Aside from them . there was only one person who passed through the empty waiting room  --  a tall woman in a tan pantsuit and a beauty-parlor face , she wrapped a scarf around her head as if there were a mirror in front of her , and with this easy look , went right out to get a taxi . Finally , from the far end of the long hallway , came a thin girl who did look like someone getting out of a psychiatrist 's office . Her walk was slow and distracted , and a loose smock or raincoat that was weighted down in the pocket kept waving out around her legs . One sloppy blondish braid was swinging on her shoulders , and with her head down , glasses kept slipping from her face . It was no surprise that she wore no makeup and , worse , had a long black pin clipped crookedly to the upper pocket of this odd raincoat that did not begin to fit . The thin girl got herself into the middle of the small waiting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white coat was no raincoat , and that on the crookedblack pin it said , N. Dubin M.D. Psychiatry . " Naomi ' . " the aunt said , jumping up from a green plastic chair that could easily have come from the office of a dentist with no eye for the future . " I know , " Naomi said . " My pantie-hose are crooked . I 'll go into the Ladies ' room and fix them . " " When did I ? " " All right , then . Ill go into the Men 's room and fix them , " Naomi said , and pulling out a bunch of keys from the weighted down pocket , she locked herself into a room that was only marked Staff . There were no years in between : who but Naomi could so quickly , immediately , lock herself into a room , any room , and without any notice , just disappear ? She even looked the same  --  the same sleepy eyes and sharp features that always made her look like a girl you could n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messy hair and glasses were the same . People always said : she must have been golden-blond as a child , but this was not true . The same dirty-blond braids hung down Naomi 's back in a picture from when she was five years old . In this picture , she was sitting on a llama in the Bronx Zoo and , wearing a dress that had once been perfect on Toby , Naomi , with her braids and her glasses , sat making faces in the sun . Right in front of the llama , sweating and holding onto a bag  --  probably popcorn that Naomi never finished  --  was her father . His sleepy eyes and round glasses passed from his face to her face exactly , arid what else could have come from him was hard to tell . Despite the calm , sleepy blondness that ran all through his family  --  stringing out nn his side a line of anemic , whispering , dirty-blond children  --  it was his maniac brother-in-law who managed , in his off-duty calm on a Sunday , also in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parkway . Left in this cab was a new bed for Naomi and three dead people : both of her parents and the maniac brother-in-law himself . Not in the cab were Naomi and Michael , Bluma 's two children , one twelve , the other seven , both alive , both impossible , one a stone , the other a boy who in seven years had learned how to do one thing : kick . " Look , " their uncle tried to explain to them at the time , to try to make them feel a little better . " Look , you 're not the first ones this happened to . When I was a little boy in Europe , my mother died at the same time that I was born so that I never even knew her , and my father died when I was five . " But all the kicker did was kirk the refrigerator right through the wall so that complaints came from the neighbors and the landlord , and he had to go and Live with an aunt on his father 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , already on her way out , already disappearing to a friend 's house , slammed a door and said , " In Europe , that 's supposed to happen . That 's the whole point of not being there . " People also said , she looks so quiet , she looks so ; erious , but these were not people who ever had to rear her open a mouth or slam a door , and did not clop to think that this was what , for twelve years , ler own mother had had to put up with , and did not lave the energy or inclination to ever try to stop . " Naomi , are you the only one who feels bad ? " he aunt had said on that day , having to run all the vay out to the elevator , just to catch up with her . ' After all , she was my only sister . And what about our cousin Toby ? The only aunts she has left now re on her father 's side , and both of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the table , you 'll ust have to keep on sponging it up , " and there , on to day of the funeral , ran off to have supper at her - lend Lenore 's . OU 'RE WEARING YOUR TASELICit DRESS , " said N. I Dubin M.D. , who had fixed up her braid and put is some lipstick and still looked no more than six-en . " What sins were you planning to get rid of ? " he twirled past the bathroom in her white coat , alked toward a new door , and was ready again to disappearing . " Naomi , do you really remember that ? When e went to the Reservoir and threw in the bread umbs ? " It was the one thing she would remember : e used to sit in the high , coarse grass near the ? , servoir , getting her holiday clothes grass-stained id filthy , staring and staring for no reason at the gin blue water and the white concrete banks .

" A rich language . To whom she ) ke this rich language was anyone 's guess . In-e , Naomi sat stone-silent like all the Dubins , king out at people from her round , cloudy glasses , if she happened to be standing in the sun , squinting up at them with the crookedness of a beggar . Not like her father 's family , whose pale , blurry quietness sat in her simply for the look  --  a disguise ? finally , when you least expected it and when there was absolutely no reason , her whiny voice would sneak out like a mimic 's  --  that was the " reicheh shprach . " As it turned out , there was one way in which Bluma may have been right : Naomi was very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records and French teachers gave awards . " Do you remember how you and Toby used to run ahead sometimes and come back nagging for ice cream even though you knew you could n't have it ? " She was paying no attention : despite her sleepy eyes and slow walk , Naomi pulled out a black notebook and looked at her watch . " The elevator is n't quicker . " she said , and taking out her keys again , unlocked a different door that turned out to be a stairway . Once , a few years before , when Mark Turkel , a neighbor 's son , had finally gotten a part in an off-Broadway play , the aunt had gone backstage with his mother . Strange doors had opened and closed , pieces of staircases jumped out of the woodwork , and rushing people in costumes humped into each other without apologies . it was this same feeling she had now , walking behind Naomi , through shiny corridors that did not end . Arrows and signs flashed through the hallways. oxygen tanks gut raced over tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assembly , passed beside bodies on stretchers ; sometimes they nodded . " Naomi , how do you know where you 're going ? You  --  who could gel lost on your way to the corner to get a loaf of bread . It drove your mother crazy . Remember ? " Nearly running  --  heavy in her mistake dress  --  the aunt was trying to catch up with Naomi , who would not stop looking as if she had something else on her mind , something that had to be done in a hurry . " This is the Coffee Shop , " was all she finally said , and pushing open a door that said Exit , nodded in her colorless , distant way at a Chinese boy in a white suit and a stethoscope . " T heard that they have a lot of foreign doctors working in hospitals . " - " He 's not foreign , he 's from San Francisco . " Naomi grabbed onto a table that was still loaded down with somebody else 's leftover lunch and said , " Decide what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't get the tuna fish . " " I 'm not really that hungry , " the aunt said , still not even sure of the round plastic chair she was trying not to slide out of . " That was n't my idea of this altogether . Anyway , since when do you eat lunch ? The only thing you ever liked was French toast , and even that you threw away half of . Remember ? " " BLT on toast and black coffee . " said Naomi to a waitress in a yellow dress who was there suddenly , and before the aunt could even say , " I think I 'll have an egg , " a redheaded girl , even younger than Naomi , was standing at the table , saying , " Dr. Dubin , there was a message for you . Dr. Fortgang wants you to prepare Mrs. Grosshard for ECT . " Naomi looked up at the girl as if she had just put down a newspaper . " Fortgang ? " she said , a smile slipping into her voice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was it a phone message , Miss Perry ? Or did Fortgang rumple his two-hundredfifty-dollar suit and actually pass through the building ? " The girl , Miss Perry , not only had red hair , but freckles all over her face , and looked as if she belonged in jeans and a plaid shirt , sitting on a fence with a fishing pole or a lunch box , waving at an orange school bus . Instead , with a nurse 's uniform and a slightly buck-toothed , summery smile , she said , " He was here , but it 's even funnier . He actually made a note on the chart . " " That is funny , " Naomi said . " He must be getting ready to send out bills , " and there in their uniforms , the two of them began laughing as if they were walking down the street together and had just seen something ridiculous in the window of a store . " Naomi , " the aunt said . " What 's ECT ? " " Electro-shock therapy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toby 's baby present is upstairs . I 'll have to go up again and get it later . " " I did n't come here to collect presents . I was just thinking of Mrs. Lippman and what happened with her son . " " What ? " " She was a very fat old woman with fat red cheeks . She lived on the ground floor . You would n't remember her . " " You were n't thinking of her cheeks . What hap-pened ? " " To her ? She 's been dead for years . She was a very old woman . " " What happened to her son ? What 's the tragedy you want to tell me ? " " Her son ? " the aunt said , remembering suddenly his similar fat cheeks and doughy , rumbling body , terrible for a boy . " Her son ? He was perfect till he was seventeen . Not only perfect , but brilliant , very mechanical . All of a sudden , when he was seventeen , he started something new . No school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers were staring at him , people were monkeying with his walkie-talkie . Even his mother could see that something was wrong , so she took him to a doctor who put him in a hospital , and instead of getting better , he got worse . " " How did he get worse ? " " He started getting very violent , so that every time she went up there to visit hint and took the special bus , she saw red marks on his face and bruises all over his arms and she never knew whether he did it to himself or else whether he got it from when they had to hold him down- " Naomi picked up her head , but it was only to wave at a boy in another kind of white suit at a different table , and swallowing some water , she gulped out , " Before phenothiazines . You know  --  tranquilizers . " Before lots of things you would hear about , you were never good in science anyway . Also , do n't forget  --  these were people who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother ? A simple old Jewish woman . She did n't know anything , but she always read the Yiddish papers very carefully , and one day she found an article about a new kind of brain operation that was a brilliant cure for craziness . Naturally it gave her hope for her son . so the next time she went to the hospital she quick ran to the doctors , and they said if she would sign the papers , it was fine with them . Why would she hesitate over a signature ? Naturally , she signed the papers , the brilliant brain operation was done , anc Mrs. Lippman was left with a vegetable . " " Lobotomies are n't done anymore , " Naomi said " and you 'd have a hard time finding anyone to de fend them . " " What about Mrs. Grossbard ? " the aunt said watching Naomi pick up her bacon sandwich tha was stuck together with blue and yellow plasti , toothpicks as if it were a wedding . " What abou Mrs. Grossbard who you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny that you any Suzy Q. Redhead could n't stop yourselves from ha% ing laughing fits about ? " Naomi could have been a girl glancing up nol and then for her subway stop . " Mrs. Grossbard ha a fancy Park Avenue doctor , " she said . " He 's tit one who makes the decisions , I 'm only the residen And anyway , you do n't have to worry . She wo n't b a vegetable . " But she 'll forget things . I know what happene to Schreihman 's sister-in-law . She woke up in ti morning and did n't know what day it was , she wet to the bakery and could n't remember a single sale girl . " " Loss of memory is only temporary , " the stoi said . " There are conditions in which ECT is ind cated . Involutional depression , for instance . " The Romans built reservoirs , only they call/ them aqueducts  --  how was this different ? " How r you know if that 's what she had ? You do n't evi know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with mcnopam You know what that is  --  change of life . " The egg the aunt was putting her fork into w cold . " Whoever expected that you would becorra. doctor ? Your mother would never have predicted She knew you were never good in science . You we good in languages like people on your father 's sit Remember that uncle of yours who had a cleani store downtown ? The one who called himself Fren Cleaner ? Some Frenchman ! " the aunt said , reel ing his squeezed-in , monkey 's face : on the way America , his boat had docked for a few days Cherbourg . " He could speak any language anyt came in with . You must remember that , Naoi You used to hang around there so much . " It v probably how she had managed to get thror medical school  --  anyone who could stand the sn of a cleaning store for hours on end would have trouble wading through four years of ether bloodstains . " You were very close with his older s Azriel . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naomi said , " I got a letter from Azriel last week . He 's in Japan . " " What 's he doing in Japan ? " " He 's studying Japanese . Azriel 's very good in languages . " " He 's not still in school . I thought he was married and had a child . " " He 's leaching at Stanford , he 's on leave for a semester , his son is four years old . " " Four ? He 'll be ready for school soon . " " He goes to a Japanese school . He 's very good in languages , too . " " I do n't see what 's funny about it , Naomi . It 's the one thing you were ever really good in . Remember that French teacher you had , Mrs. Gelfand , who could n't stop raving about you when you translated those French poems ? And that Israeli engineer who was staying across the hall who said he could have sworn you were a sabre the few times you bothered to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but all she said was , " Hi . Steve , " to a tall , sun-tanned boy whose giant circus-clown 's tie bobbed out from underneath his white jacket together with his Adam 's apple . " Nan , " said S. Sonnenborn M.D. Psychiatry . " You were beautiful this morning . No shit . First presentation I have n't slept through in months . " The tall clown 's eyes seemed to follow the glow of his tie the way Naomi 's did a windowed distance . " Thanks , " Naomi said . She was trying to fix an earring and in one minute her long white sleeve would be soaking up coffee . " Naomi , you give more to the floor than you put in your mouth , " her uncle used to say to her . But it was easy for him to have patience , he was not the one who cleaned the floor . A buzz from S. Sonnenborn 's pocket forced him : o pull out a walkie-talkie . " I 'm on Call , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the iottoms of his sideburns , his tie pulled him out to he door , and the aunt said , " Naomi , why did that joy call you Nao ? It 's not a name , it sounds like a leodorant . " " For short , " she said . " For a nickname . " " But no one in your life ever called you Nao. ( our parents never called you that , your uncle and never called you that . It is n't even your real name - Naomi ? it 's only your English name . Your real lame , the name that your mother gave you is icehama . " " I know what my name is . Let 's go upstairs , I 'll et you Toby 's baby present . " " Look how you call it ' baby present ' ! You do n't yen know the names of Toby 's children . They ould n't know You if they saw you on the street and ou 're practically an aunt to them . And what about our brother ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt so close to you . " " We were hardly even brought up together . Any-ay , I saw him when I was in California , and if he zeds money for bail , he knows my phone number . " " Money for bail ? " the aunt said . " Who do you ink you are that you can talk that way ? What will m have from all this but years of debts ? " " Just like all other medical students . I 'll pay it back . " " But you 're not like all other medical students . How could you turn out this way ? How could Michael ? What could he possibly have in common with all those boys rebelling against their parents ' swimming pools ? He practically had no parents . let alone swimming pools . " " Why do n't you ask him ? He 's the one with theories . I was only good in languages . " " But why did be have to get tear-gassed ? What happened to him ? " " You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as everyone else . " " But Naomi , he 's your brother . Do you think he resented us ? " " I 'm not Michael . How do I know ? " " You 're a psychiatrist . That 's why I 'm asking you . " " Thai 's right . I 'm a psychiatrist and Michael is a dropout , and those arc both categories that everyone can understand . " " I 'm not concerned with everyone . For you , spilling your coffee and monkeying around with other people 's memories are all the same thing , because to you it does n't matter what you forget . " But already , Naomi had gotten up and in her distant , disappearing way , was floating past the cash register . " That 's a cute hat , " she said to a foreign-looking girl who had just tumbled through the door in a blue raincoat . The girl pulled the hat off her head as if she had n't known she were wearing it , and in a fuzzy , foreign voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister . In many colors . I can give you one if you want . " " Since when are you interested in hats ? " the aunt said , but the girl  --  delicate . fair-skinned , and dazed , continued to look as if she had just been pulled out of an avalanche . " Na-o-mi , " she said . " You wo n't believe what I have been through . Do you know what his wife said ? ' That lovely Danish girl in your department ? why do n't we invite her for dinner ? ' " " He told you that ? " Naomi said . " What a bastard . " The girl seemed about to cry . She took off her raincoat and said , " I do n't even have many cigarettes . " " Listen , Inga . " Naomi said . " Let 's have dinner tonight . Just come over to my apartment . " " I ca n't do it . I 'm on First Call . It 's better , I think , it 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the aunt said , " She 's so pretty . Why is she a doctor ? " Naomi looked at her watch , and fussing again with her little black notebook , shuffled straight into an elevator where a man in a sheet lay stretched out on a table . His face was the color of worn-out underwear , and tubes and bottles hung down on all sides . " This elevator ? " " You 're not at a bus stop , " Naomi said . " This is a hospital , " and seeing her face  --  thin , distant and
