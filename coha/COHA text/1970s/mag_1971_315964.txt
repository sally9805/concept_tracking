" I 'VE encouraged her to elope , " White House Press Aide Connie Stuart confided two months back . No such luck . The announcement was leaked in advance , but when President Nixon went before the St. Patrick 's Eve crowd of 300 in the East Room he insisted : " Until I say it , it 's not official . " So he said it : " Mrs. Nixon and I are very honored to announce the engagement of our daughter Tricia to Edward Cox of New York . " Petite and elegant in a low-cut white gown bordered with ostrich feathers , Tricia led her fianc onto the stage to warm applause . She outshone everybody that evening-the guest of honor , Ireland 's Prime Minister John Lynch : her mother , whose 59th birthday was part of the celebration ; and her prospective in-laws , whom Nixon failed to introduce . It will be a White House wedding , the eighth for a daughter of an incumbent President , some time in June .

She has visited Cox frequently in Cambridge , Mass. , where they customarily dine-surrounded by Secret Service agents-at small , inexpensive restaurants or at Lincoln 's Inn , a law-school social club .

" Since just before Christmas , Tricia has been sporting a diamond-and-sapphire ring , an heirloom first given to Cox 's maternal grandmother . Eddie is 24 , Tricia 25-only seven months apart .
