For three uninterrupted hours , the little blue Chevrolet Vega cruised steadily around the Michigan International Speedway southwest of Detroit at a constant 50 m.p.h . That performance fell far short of setting any endurance or speed records . But when the car finally pulled into the pits , the joy at trackside was unconfined . Toasts were drunk and the engineer who had prepared the Vega for its run was doused with beer . The small knot of men had every reason to celebrate . Their little car had just traveled some 150 miles at a respectable highway speed , although under its hood there was nothing more than a 40-horsepower electric motor . <P> For years , the principal obstacle in the way of practical electric-powered highway vehicles has been the power supply . Familiar lead-acid storage batteries , while adequate as a supplemental source of electricity in conventional cars , suffer from what engineers call a " low energy density " ; they need frequent recharging and deliver relatively little energy for their size and weight . Enough of them to power an electric car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , there is little room for improvement ; lead-acid batteries have already been developed close to their theoretical peak . Other batteries using different materials-nickel and cadmium , zinc and silver , or sodium and sulfur-have greater energy density , but they have not yet proved practical either , largely because of high costs . <P> Looking for alternatives . Chemist Philip C. Symons , director of the Udylite Co. ' s energy development lab , turned to a combination of inexpensive and readily available substances : zinc and chlorine . Other experimenters-notably General Motors ' Allison Division - have also built batteries using chlorine and are confident that such batteries , when refined , will have an energy density high enough to make them practical for powering electric automobiles . But chlorine has two serious drawbacks . It is a poisonous gas that could endanger the occupants of a car if it seeped into the passenger compartment and under ordinary conditions it occupies a very large volume , making it difficult to store . To overcome the problems of free chlorine , Symons devised a system using a solid called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorine and water molecules that looks like gold-tinted ice and is safe and easily handled . <P> When Symons ' battery is in use , the heat produced by its electrochemical reactions breaks the chlorine hydrate apart into its separate components . The freed chlorine is released directly into the battery 's electrolytic solution , where it helps sustain the electricity-producing chemical reactions . Because the chlorine remains dissolved , it is no more of a threat to driver or passengers than the acid in an ordinary battery . <P> The Udylite system is hardly ready for the road . Together with its supporting gear , the Vega 's experimental battery alone weighed some 2,000 lbs. , almost as much as the full weight of a conventional Vega . But now that the troublesome chlorine is under control , the weight problem seems relatively minor . Symons foresees the day when zinc chloride batteries will be small enough and powerful enough to push small two-to four-passenger cars-if not at turnpike speeds , at least fast enough and far enough to meet the less strenuous demands of city and suburban driving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
