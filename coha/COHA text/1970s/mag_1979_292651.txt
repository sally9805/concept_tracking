Dtente should not become a tranquilizer <P> Henry Kissinger , in or out of power , is a judicious analyst of geopolitics . Last week the former Secretary of State discussed the global dimensions of the Iran crisis with TIME State Department Correspondent Christopher Ogden . Excerpts from the interview : <P> Q. How will the turbulence in Iran affect the surrounding area ? <P> A. It is bound to magnify an already enormous unreadiness . Even before , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were re-examining their policies . Turkey was in a state of turmoil or , at any rate , in a state of reappraising its policy . Clearly , Saudi Arabia has shown at the Baghdad conference of rejectionists and with respect to the rise in the price of oil that it has opted for a more autonomous course from us . I think all of these tendencies will be magnified by the turbulence in Iran . Geopolitically , this area has been a barrier to Soviet expansion , and it has defined the limits of Soviet influence . Such countries as Turkey , Iran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation . There is now a great danger that this will become much more ambiguous and therefore an area of enormous uncertainty . <P> Q. What is the Soviet role in this area ? <P> A. The Soviet role is twofold : one , geopolitical . During all of the postwar period , the countries bordering the Indian Ocean believed that the United States was strategically predominant in that area and that , therefore , that friendship with the United States assured their security , both internationally and , to some extent , domestically . The Soviet march through Africa , with Cuban troops , from Angola to Ethiopia , and the Soviet moves through Afghanistan and South Yemen , or at least the moves of Soviet clients , altered that perception . That inevitably decreased the importance of friendship with the United States and emboldened our opponents We simply did not understand that what happened in the Horn of Africa had a geopolitical design , independent of any specific action that the Soviet Union might have undertaken to foment any particular upheaval . <P> Secondly , I believe that sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran and run so effectively that even when people go back to work they do not increase production could not have taken place without central organization . Whether they were organized in the Soviet Union or organized by people trained by the Soviet Union in other countries is really a secondary question . I think it is certainly the result of Soviet support of radical movements on a global basis , which has also now reached Iran . <P> Of course , there are other factors . I do not think that the mullahs were triggered by the Soviet Union . However , some trained agitators probably helped fan the flames that already existed even there . No doubt there existed objective reasons for discontent , but the margin between unrest and revolution came at least in part from the outside . <P> Q. Can we expect more from the Soviets along this arc ? <P> A. The more that the United States looks out of control of events , the more it appears as if our friends are going down without effective American support or even effective American understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will seem self-started and , in effect , spontaneous . <P> Q. What should we be doing ?
