ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY , far from the rotting row houses of the black ghetto with its dropouts and junkies , safe in the sanctuary of the neat , white , working-class neighborhood , there is a grimy poolroom that is lit too brightly . The white kids with long , matted hair squint as they drift in from the night , forming knots around the two ratty little pool tables , their shrill laughter spilling out from under the iealding fluorescent lights onto darkened Bloom5eld Avenue . Dropouts . A few junkies . Most are Ln dungarees , some in Levi jackets , as if it were 1 uniform . Only two girls are in the crowd , both . xpertly- shooting pool , chewing gum seriously , . ough girls in tight sweaters . On the sidewalk , ids flick glowing cigarette butts into the gutter is they lean against the poolroom 's two huge storefront windows where the faded red letters rom another time can still be seen spelling , J &; J Confectionery . " Most come here after spending their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of their own kind of ghetto . The wenty-two-year-old with the trimmed beard and he pleading . liquid eyes , who calls himself " J.B. " nd says he shoots heroin a couple of times a reek , but gets turned away by methadone pro- ; rams that are looking for harder addicts , espeially blacks . The self-confident eighteen-yearId , Gerard Furrule , who works his way easily-asil aroun around a pool table , quit school in ninth grade , worked in a print shop for a dollar an hour , and now gets $1.90 in the mail room of a big company . In this candy store turned poolroom , he is considered a success . He is going to classes in the evening , trying to get his high-school diploma . College ? " Only niggers go to college , " one of his buddies says morosely . Gerard smiles . These kids are part of a dwindling white minority in Newark , New Jersey , where blacks arc 54 per cent and Puerto Ricans 13 per cent of the 382,000 people and where , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result has been a new set of angry lines between whites and blacks , drawn as never before in an American city . Black power has been converted into reality with such headiness , and the outside white establishment has applauded the turnabout so vigorously , that many whites in Newark have been left with a corrosive sense of invisibility . Colleges that send recruiters to Newark do so in search of blacks , not working-class whites . Federal programs designed to help youngsters get jobs , keep them off drugs , provide them with recreation , and improve their schooling are aimed at blacks , staffed by blacks , and located in black neighborhoods . They do not reach the white kids who hang out at the J J Confectionery . But simple neglect fails to explain completely the difficulties of Newark 's poor and working-class whites , just as it never fully summed up the black experience in America . The whites , especially the Italians , are deeply distrusted by many blacks who have attained power , including the city 's first black mayor , Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized crime , corruption , and white racism that gripped the city government under his predecessor , Hugh J. Addonizio . Just before the 1970 election , Addonizio was indicted on sixty-four counts of extortion and conspiracy , along with several city councilmen , former public works directors , and reputed Mafia figures . The indictment , which led to a ten-year federal prison sentence for Addonizio and contributed to his defeat by Gibson , also contaminated all the city 's Italians , even those who were disgusted by the corruption , for it reinforced ? both to the blacks and to outsiders ? a sinister stereotype . Now , after all the shifts of power , going to Newark is like stepping into a hall of mirrors where familiar images are inverted and twisted into remarkable , confusing shapes that destroy any sense of equilibrium . The familiar American patterns of racism and exploitation dissolve into a mad array of reversals and contradictions . Gibson is widely regarded by whites as a moderate , undramatic , conscientious man who has n't the strength to resist the pressure of some militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New Ark , " a romantic vision of black nationalism and black pride . The major architect of this vision ? and of Gibson 's election ? is the poet and playwright LeH.oi Jones , who has adopted the African name of Imamu Baraka. his brilliant pursuit of political power and cultural strength for blacks has frightened many whites , who see in the dashikis of the black councilmen , the clenched-fist salutes of the Board of Education members , and the black-liberation flags in the schools the symbols of a new racism . The institution most sensitive to this surge of black pride is the Board of Education , always in the past a crucial instrument of white power . Gibson 's black appointees have proved more militant than the mayor , and since they constitute the majority of the board , some of them at public meetings sneer and laugh at the white members . Many white citizens say they no longer dare enter the board 's hearing room with its dark-stained wood and curved , polished wooden dais . The few whites who do go to monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black audiences , and their testimony is ignored by the predominantly black board . In the spring of 1971 , at the height of an emotional teachers ' strike , a black physician , Dr. E. Wyman Garrett , rose at a public hearing . pointed to a white board member , John Cervase , and said : " Cervase. we know where you live . Were going to get you . We 're really going to get you . " Then lie allegedly ordered several black men to beat up a white reporter who had written down his threat . Amateur racism E 'RE THE NIGGERS NOW , that 's what 's hap- pened , " said Stephen N. Aduhato . " It just is who 's on top . The group that 's second 's gon na catch shit ? they 're gon na be niggers . This is what this country 's really all about . " Aduhato hunched intently over his desk . " The blacks are n't so sophisticated with their racism . They 're just learning what power is about , what America 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? we 're not sophisticated about our racism as . Italians . We 're amateurs too . " Once a school . teacher , Adubato is emerging as a political leadei in Newark 's North Ward , the stronghold of the city 's remaining working-class Italian-Ameri cans , who make up most of the city 's white pope lation . He spent his younger years fighting fru the rights of blacks , and he campaigned for Gib son . But as the power of the blacks grew in city , and as he discovered that nobody was tryI ing to help the Italians , he turned his attentior to his own people . Ile left teaching and won elec tion as Democratic leader in the North Ward . " Let me give you this analogy , " he said . " see the Italian community in Newark and th , 78 black community in Newark face to face , really in a crowd , lined up in a crowd . And the pressure , the momentum , is with the blacks , and they 're pushing us backward , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're fighting back , you know , clawing and punching and kicking in the balls and all the rest . But if you reach up and look beyond that line , that black line , you 'll see all of the white liberals and do-gooders and the people who really wo n't meet the problem , pushing , encouraging , you know , and putting on more pressure . It 's a nice picture , you can almost see it . D' ya see it ? " He laughed . " And of course we look bad because we 're cursin ' and swearin' ' , and we say ' nigger ' all the time , and the people in the back always said Negro ' when that was right and now ' black . ' They talk the right way , and they 're actually assisting . Someone 's got to be hurt , that 's what I hear , someone 's got to be hurt . " Adubato is full of statistics that show the extent of the hurt : a study by the Board of Education , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates going to college dropped from 50 per cent in 1969 to 45 per cent in 1970 , while the proportion of blacks rose from 49 to 52 per cent . " There 's a great need in the black area for the things that are being done , and they 're only scratching the surface , " Adubato said . " But take two cases of terminal cancer . The black cancer is more acute , in six months it 's terminal ; the white cancer is less acute , it would take eighteen months before it 's terminal . Now some asshole liberal by looking at that analogy , you know what he says ? Well , the whites are three times better off . So what does he do ? He goes on the black street exclusively . Nobody attends to the white cancer . " N BARRINGER HIGH SCHOOT. , white teenagers ? who make up about one-fourth of the stulent body ? find themselves engulfed by a whirlvind of blackness : black history , black litcraure , black culture , black pride , all the compoicnts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a people enslaved and ieaten down and brutalized over the centuries . t is not so healthy for the whites . Every morn-rig , " Swahili music " is played over the school 's arlrlic address system , and some white students ind it as offensive and threatening as blacks you 'd find " Dixie . " The day after the Board of : duration voted to hang the black , red , and Teen flag of black liberation in every classroom bith a majority of black students ( a move ulti-lately barred by the courts ) , someone got on le PA system and said , " Brothers be cool , sisters e sweet , and others well , just others . " Whites stay out of the cafeteria , which is lack turf : they do n't go to basketball games , since the team is black . And just as blacks used to avoid dances at school in Adubato 's day , now whites avoid them , taking the cue from the dance posters in the hallways with pictures of black couples cut out of black magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a social event that applied to me , " said Stephen Mustacchio , an eighteenyear-old senior . " The same thing with the school chorus : ' Brothers and sisters , if you want to find yourself , join the chorus . ' I mean , you know , the white people ca n't join the chorus if they want to ? " One boy ventured into a college recruiter 's meeting where it had been announced , as usual , that " a representative will be here today to recruit black and Puerto Rican students , " and found talk only of black clubs and black studies , " like I did n't belong there , " he said . He did n't apply . In English class , " you have to read black literature , " Steve said . " They never give you any white literature to read . You have to read Black Voices , there 's a book out called Black Voices , then we had to read Malcolm X , then there 's another one about a black child . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the teachers at Barringer are white , but they are fearful of the black students declaring them " insensitive , " which Adubato noted means insensitive not to Italians or to whites ? just to blacks . The sense of worthlessness and inferiority that has so long afflicted blacks now seems to threaten these white youngsters , many of whom are struggling to get to college , something their parents could not do . They and their parents see themselves in double jeopardy , a minority in their own city , yet too urban and too Italian to be part of the American mainstream . which they characterize as suburban and WASP . " When you really feel this is like when you get into college , " said Lucille Poet , a bright-eyed college sophomore whose father is a foreman in a factory . " You ca n't get a scholarship because you 're not quite poor enough ? well , really , you 're not black . And you get into college and they look at you , you come from Newark , and you 're caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really a white person , but you 're not poor enough to be a colored person . " When she finished , a roomful of North Ward kids let the silence hang for a long moment . B HT THE . KIDS FAIL TO SEE the parallels between their experience and the complaints of blacks about predominantly white schools where no black literature is read and no blacks appear as characters in American history . When the similarity was suggested , Lucille 's brother Maurice snapped , " Why should that affect us ? " And Steve Mustacchio explained , " When I reached high school my whole attitude changed toward them , ' cause I was n't really in too much contact with them . I went to a private white grammar school , I hardly spoke about them or anything , but when I got to high school , I had to go to school with them , I grew to hate them . When I got to school , and I saw who they were , I came to hate them . " In their candor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newark teenagers , who go to Vailsburg High School , the last high school in the city in which whites still con ? stitute the majority , and only 30 per cent of the students are black . Sitting in a circle one evening on the floor of a room belonging to a young divinity student who is trying to help organize the white community , about a dozen white Vailsburg students were asked if they had black friends . " Of course ! " they shouted in an annoyed chorus . Pressed for specifics , the kids got tense . Only one girl could name a friend who was black , and her friend went to another school . The Vailsburg kids have the luxury of fighting very hard to be , or at least to appear , open-minded . The same is often true of North Ward youngsters who have gone to mostly white private high schools . Everyone in that room could list clear differences between his own and his parents ' attitudes toward blacks . Always the parents were bigots or racists . By contrast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Steve Mustacchio even disputes his mother 's liberal attitude that " I work with them and I gel along with them . " " She works in a candy factory with the older type of people , " Steve said . " She do n't have to put up with everything . " Some kids try to resist black pressure . btr others succumb . The Rev. John R. Sharp , Presbyterian minister in the mostly white Vails burg section , describes an effort his church made to organize a summer basketball team s ( white neighborhood youngsters would have chance to take part in the downtown recreatior programs , which are run mostly for blacks . " Our kids would go down and get on the tour and they would freeze , they could n't play , " Shari said . " They 'd lose their cool , they would get s ( uptight playing in an all-black neighborhood and the blacks would continue to take adyantagi of that and just keep up a running commentary You better go on back to white town ' and laugl at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids woul ( be on best behavior ? they would n't respond And they would n't go back next time . " Sharp counts himself among the few liberal in Newark . lie resembles the young , moderat black leaders of a previous generation , strivim to show the majority that his constituents ar . human beings who defy easy stereotypes , wh. present no threat . He is even hanging on in th face of open hostility , living in a mostly him neighborhood and suffering the telephone call of some black parents who tell him , " Keep you honky kids away from our kids . " Sharp plained that the blacks are worried about th white youngsters eroding the black identity o their children . In response to the dominance of the city ' black power structure , especially in the pohli schools , Sharp and other white leaders hay tried to do what black leaders in many common ties managed years ago ? unite the diverse ele ments in their neighborhood to speak with on voice on selected issues . The result is an umbrell organization known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals be John Birchers and Wallace supporters as wel " One of the conservatives said , We could pro ' ably be more moderate , Reverend , but if we die they 'd walk over us , and so what we do is go a the way to the right . We take a position . and v$ wo n't move , and we let you guys do all ti negotiation . ' " This role as white organizer leads Sharp inn some remarkable statements , the kind of stat ments that were not at all remarkable when bla ( leaders used to make them about their own pe pie . " If they felt they had a voice , " Sharp sa : wistfully of his white constituency . " The gre victory is to get the Board of Education to de with the people and not deal with the stereoty ? it 's awful hard . Now it 's a problem of trying convince the black majority to be humane at just toward the white minority . " BO T HE SYMMETRY OF BLACK AND WHITE response to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real political questions . " It 's the same way as white pride has gotten bad , " said Frank DonDiego , who grew up in Newark and now goes to college at Rutgers . " The blacks have gotten their pride , and it started in the beginning really beautiful , but now they 've gone into the same while hang-ups ; pride has become a superiority trip . " Adubato 's response to the dominance of the blacks is considerably different from Sharp 's , but no less pragmatic . Ile reaches back for his own roots as an Italian , arguing that as a minority ethnic group , Italians should be given the same kind of representation on public bodies , in City Hall , and in federal programs that blacks have won for themselves in cities where they are the minority . He scorns Gibson 's two major Italian appointees one a deputy mayor , one a school board member ? as " Uncle Marius " who " think black . " Even though most teachers , policemen , and firemen are still white , the alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional , hate-filled topic of conversation at the Italian social clubs in the North Ward , where men gather in the evenings to watch ball games on television or shoot pool or drink or play cards or eat huge meals they cook themselves in ancient kitchens laden with enormous pots and greasy stoves . The rhetoric swirls back and forth between fact and myth . " What about Newark Airport ? The construction of the new airport ? They held up construction for a year already , they stopped all construction on it , being that it 's being built in Newark they want 50 per cent of the working force minorities , if they 're qualified or not , because they 're black or Puerto Rican . That means if I 'm a qualified man , a bricklayer , I 'm gon na lose a fuckin ' job because I 'm gon na be replaced by a shine that has no qualifications . But being it 's being built in Newark , it 's supposedly a majority of fuckin ' shines , they want the shines to do the bricklayin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Cannestro , a young truck driver for Sears , shakes his head in disbelief . Then he repeats the complaint that many Italians voice in Newark . that the federal government and private lending institutions give blacks preference when it comes to mortgages or business loans . " They would turn me down and back the shine , " Cannestro says . " I know about five people that had experiences like that . " Whether or not such tales are true , they exist with fiery credibility around the card tables in the Italian clubs . These are working men who generally make under $10,000 , own $2,000 brick or wooden row houses on dingy streets , can not get fire insurance because of the 1967 riots in the city 's ghettos , pay one of the nation 's highest property tax rates ( nearly $10 per $100 ) , and submit to what some of them bitterly term a " double tax , " the tuition for the parochial schools they feel they owe their children . They are racists , sure , and they like George Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader who is now a state assemblyman from the North Ward . But simply to dismiss them as racists and thereby discard their anger and their hurt is to make a sad mistake , one for which they hate the news media and the Establishment in Washington and the suburban exec- utives who crowd downtown Newark during daylight to run the businesses that exclude Italians at least as efficiently as they exclude blacks . " The liberals are so good at understanding every other group , why do n't they want to understand us ? " Adubato asks . " Our mothers work in factories ? we 're the white pigs , " The urge to flee NI ANY WHITES WHO HAVE DECIDED to stay in Newark have begun to see themselves as victims not only of the new black power but also of the larger greed and indifference of outside white America . Many understand that they and the blacks are equal victims of the rampant block-busting being attempted in white neighborhoods of their city , where they are barraged by letters and phone calls from real estate agents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses can be resold at inflated levels to black families . Signs painted with the word " SOH ) " in electric red or orange have been nailed up by real estate agents so that they stick out horizontally from houses , flagging the points of panic on an otherwise peaceful residential block . Some residents of Vailsburg , which has a lovely , more suburban look than the North Ward , have even begun countering with signs declaring , " This House Is NOT For Sale . " The whites who stay expose themselves to the pain of seeing their old neighborhoods , where they and their fathers and grandfathers once lived , ravaged by poverty and decay . They see it every time they drive into downtown Newark , past the old streets , the old corners , past the Boys ' Clubs and the YMCAs where they spent hours as children , but where their children can not go . Sticking it out in Newark , stopping the trend that saw 10,000 whites leave in the 1960s , is a political strategy in Adubato 's terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . It is also a matter of pride to some , and it stirs sharp debate within families . In one of the shabby brick row houses on a narrow street in the North Ward , a forty-six-year-old man who works the nightshift in a Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery , his wife , and their twenty-two-year-old son talked through the question of leaving . They have lived all their lives in Newark , their parents having arrived there from Italy- , but their block has become mostly Puerto Rican , and crime has increased in recent years . The father , a serious , well-read man although he had only two years of high school , was adamant about staying . The mother and the son , a college student who lives at home , wanted to leave . They asked that their names not be used . " There 's no magic in black skin , and sume of us are beginning to realize you can not run , " the father said , " because if you run from Wakeman Avenue today , you 're going to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's from Mt . Prospect Avenue tomorrow , you 're gon na run from Llewellyn Park , which is an exclusive suburban residential area , the following day . When do you stop running ? " He asked his daughter to get him the Scotch , and he poured some into a shot glass . The bottle in one hand , the glass in the other , he drank and gestured as he talked . his wife , lighting a cold , rubbed her raw nose with a handkerchief . " I happen to be here all day , " she said . " My husband is away at work , so I 'm stuck with all the trials that go on , whether they he black or Spanish , so I have the inclination to run . I can cope with the winters , but the summer ? it seems as if the warm weather sets everybody off . I do n't enjoy the summers here at all . The winters , we close the door , it gets dark early and I 'm glad . " " Pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the sense of staying in a city , any city , right ? Now Newark is just about the worst city in the country . I 'm only living in Newark right now because I have to . I 'm not running from Newark ; I 'm running from a hunch of garbage , which is alien to my nature and I do n't want to be part of it . " " For you , son , this is okay , " his father answered with a tone of finality . " I 'm staying in Newark because I simply do not want someone pushing me out . I do not want the idea that I am running away . " Not all young Italians in Newark want to flee . Jim Cundari , for one , a handsome , twenty-sevenyear-old lawyer whose family moved from the city a few years ago , found the suburbs barren and Caine back . " If you go to a shopping center community , you lose that little corner grocery store where you-go and get your Italian cheeses and your sausage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the close row houses and the stoops and the kind of social activity . You just lose the closeness with your whole sense of your history and your traditions . " When Newark was authorized by the federal government to expand its Model Cities program to include not just the central ghetto but the entire city , Cundari , with Adubato 's help , tried to get a job in the Newark Model Cities agency to represent the Italians . He was refused ; the agency remains virtually all black , and Model Cities funds are still not getting into white neighborhoods . Cundari found a post in the office of the city 's Business Administrator , but the morning he showed up for work , he was met on the steps of City Hall by an aide to Mayor Gibson : and informed that there was no job for him . Dur. ing the months that followed , he was told repeatedly that the budget could n't support him . " I was pretty well convinced that the reason I was n't getting in was because I was Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulders being in a position of responsibility . " through Gibson 's personal intervention , ' , undari was hired and put in charge of the city 's obbying efforts in Trenton , the state capital . ! ARSON HAS TRIED HARD to integrate his staff OF and limit patronage to the less crucial antiloverty-type programs , but an acute apprehenion seems to run through his efforts . He corndains that white civil servants who can not be red subvert his policies by a kind of passive esistance , refusing to do anything they are not irectly ordered to do . He has named whites to nportant posts , such as police director , fire di , vtor , and business administrator . But they are of Italians . Gibson 's nervousness is not exactly surprising . he City Council , stiff mostly Italians , opposes im at every turn . It insisted op retaining as city aditor an accountant who in twenty-four years ad never found a problem with Newark 's books id who , for the same length of time , had done le auditing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law enforcement offials as the Mafia head in Newark . In addition , e most venomous hatred of blacks and of Gib-m himself during his campaign came from alians the former police director , Dominick firm , for example , and Anthony Imperiale , who Irned of rapists and insurrectionists taking over e city if Gibson became mayor . When Gibson came into office in July of 1970 , found city government a shambles , mangled make corruption easy . There was almost no iddle management to dilute the power of the lop city officials , with the result that there was not much management at all . The city had not a single licensed engineer to check for error or fraud in work done by private firms on millions of dollars ' worth of sewer and road projects . Virtually every city contract had been let with a 10 per cent kickback to city officials . Some sewers were built to nowhere , simply ending underground . Cur ruplion heightened the special viciousness about Newark , the rawness in the racism of both whites and blacks . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real concept of brotherhood in this city , " Cudari said . " We all have our own agendas , fur the simple reason that we all have such real problems . The consciousness of who you are and what you are is so rampant in the city , as soon as something becomes identified as yours , that 's it . There 's no one going into an Italian barbershop and trying to challenge whether they 'll cut a black man 's hair . There 's no one trying to implement busing to bring whites and blacks into closer community . It just does n't work that way . No one wants it . In a city like this , people would be content with separate but equal facilities , and no one would challenge it . " Newark may be the real truth about America , the nation 's subconscious finally stripped of its rationalizations and platitudes . The city wallows in the swath of stinking factories that belch filth 11:0/11 the Jersey flats into the shadow of the Statue of Liberty . It has also tarnished the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making old dreams laughable .
