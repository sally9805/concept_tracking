T HANK GOD I got to save Elvis Presley in time . When I think , Armok what might have happened if I had n't gotten to him ... well , it makes me sick to think of it . Yes , sick , so sick and desperate that I feel I might lose my mind . If anything ever happened to Elvis I 'd die  --  I mean my life would be over . The best part would be over , that 's for sure . That 's why when I heard what bad shape he was in I knew it was my mission to get to him , to reach that sweet shy soul underneath that beautiful face and beautiful body , it was my divine purpose to save him . I was God it makes me sick to think about infinity . I 'm not going to then . Why should I face things that will drive me insane ? We must all get on with the business of life , must n't we ? Eat , sleep , buy groceries , ride buses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is all about anyway , is n't it ? Just let me say one or two things though about the beginnings of Elvis Presley . They will be redeemed by their slight humor . A thuggish girl named Karen from my sixth-grade class was visiting me one afternoon with a silly , giggling , chubby girl named Elinor . This tough , thuggish girl who had just moved to Long Island from a tough part of Brooklyn knew all about rock and roll . Her older brother had black wavy hair and blue eyes , was a poor student , and dressed to look like a hood . Instead of trying to be Ivy League , as was done in our little suburb , he wore tight black pegged pants and a black leather jacket . In no time he became all the rage . Karen was bored at my house and kept asking where my records were and I told her that all I had in rock and roll were Seventeen and Rock Around the Clock . " Come on , " she said , " What about Heartbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come on , you 've heard of Heartbreak Hotel . It 's the big thing . It 's number one . " " I never have heard of it and I do n't even know what it is . " " What ? And you 're supposed to be so popular . " " Come on , do n't tell me you never heard of Elvis Presley ? E111111vis ? " " What is it ? " " WHAT IS IT ? What is it ? " Karen was screaming and Elinor was giggling . " It 's him , not it ! " " You mean it 's the name of a person ? " " Yes , stupid , it 's the name of a gorgeous handsome singer ! Everyone has his record in Brooklyn ! You 're gon na faint when you see him ! " Karen got her loose-leaf book and opened it up , and inside , instead of having notes and assignments , she had pictures of this person Elvis Presley . I did n't expect that a girl like Karen would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got Cs in spelling and Ds in reading and conduct , she had a pool table in her finished basement and her parents owned a beauty parlor . But when I saw the picture I was stunned , and I immediately admitted that Elvis Presley really was the cutest I had ever seen . It was the clearest truth , he was the cutest , although maybe too much of a hood for me . I was n't sure what that hood look meant and I thought it might mean something bad . When we went back with Karen to her house so we could hear the record I was surprised to see that it was not a real record . " It 's a forty-five , dopey ! " she said . It was a tiny , thin record with a big hole in the middle and it had to be played with a big red plastic cylinder on the phonograph spindle . " Rock Around the Clock is on a normal record , " I said . " Seventy-eights are out now , " Karen said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really understand Heartbreak Hotel . I thought it must be about a sleazy rooming house in some slummy part of town down South or somewhere . And I did n't know why such an adorable-looking boy would sing about such a thing . It frightened me to picture the hotel , dark and gloomy , with peeling yellowed wallpaper and bare light bulbs swinging in the long hallways on the way to the public bathroom . But then there was something about that special voice and the way it went down to those low gasps , crying , " lonely , lonely " all of a sudden from the high sweet voice of pure youth on the " heartbreak hotel , " and the way he breathed those heavy deep breaths , moaning , " be so lonely , baby , make you so lonely , baby , be so lonely , baby . " There was something frightening and exciting in that line but I did n't know what it was . I guess we listened to the record over and over that day about ten or fifteen times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing , and to hear the song was another , but to watch him sing that song was something else . I now know that it was sex . I did n't know what sex was at the time ; I 'd heard of it and knew the facts , but I did n't know the feeling . It was when I got to see Elvis Presley on television that I learned the feeling . I 'm afraid I thought it was love . But it was love . Elvis Presley was the first male I loved and Yll never love anybody the way I love him . I 'm intelligent , I 'm high class , I have degrees in higher learning , I have a trained mind , I 'm an original thinker , I wear horn-rimmed glasses ( for driving and movies ) , I buy designer clothes from Bloomingdale 's and antique clothes from all over . I 'm thin and flat-chested , I 'm a modern young woman , and I love Elvis Presley , I always have . I love him harder than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I Iove him so hard it makes me sick to think of him , makes me cry to hear him sing . It was Do n't Be Cruel that pushed my excitement to an unbearable pitch . It was the , what they call " the beat , " the beat , the voice and the way he said , " Baby , I really love you , baby . Baby , it 's still you I 'm thinking of . " I wanted to hear him sing it again and again but instead there was a commercial and some stupid comedy act that was n't a bit funny . When I heard I Want You , I Need You , I Love You I left the world of reality . I could feel myself slipping on the " Ho-ho-hold " of the " Hold me close hold me tight , " slipping and drifting quickly under his spell . When he sang , " I thought I could live without romance uh-uh-un-til you came to me , " I knew that he was just kidding around on the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , so serious that as soon as I 'd hear the few bars of guitar that preceded it , the excitement would sweep over me  --  a soft dark velvet wave in my brain rolling over everything else that had ever been there . " You 're like Pavlov 's dog , " my sister said . ? y ES . THE MEMBERS of my family were harsh with Elvis , they were cruel . My father had never had patience for any kind of emotional singing , or any emotion . for that matter . When he 'd come into the room and a female singer was emoting and moving and twisting intensely out of feeling for some love song , usually pretty bad , I have to admit , he would jt , stand there holding his pipe and say to , C.Z5e , TV , " Is something wrong with you , Mil ' . , xt-s . A T NIGHT IN OUR ROOM at our summer house my sister and I would occasionally talk before we fell asleep . We had very narrow beds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was between the beds so that I could n't see her face , just the shape of her body in the dark under the white summer blanket . There were two bookshelves over our heads , and I had pasted some color pictures of Elvis to the bottom shelf on my side so I could look at his face at any time before I fell asleep or when I woke up . My sister liked to tease me about these pictures . " He 's just a cheap , vulgar , greasy hood , " she 'd say . " He 's ignorant and low class and cheap . " " I bet he 's sweet and kind and he 's just kidding about being a hood . " " I 'm sure he 's lacking in intelligence also . " " I read in a fan magazine that there 's a contest to win a date with him . You write an essay on why you want a date with him and the best essay wins . You know , in school I always win for the best composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a twenty-two-year-old . " " Why not ? I look fourteen . I could wear make-up . " " I 'd tell them your age . " " Why ? Why could n't I have one date with him ? " " Look , even if you did , by some chance , win , out of all the millions of girls , mostly mature teenagers , millions all over America , which is very unlikely with all that competition , you could n't go . Daddy would forbid you . " " Why ? " I cried . " Because Elvis Presley is just a low cheap hood . You know what ? If I were walking down a dark street alone at night , and I saw him , without knowing it was Elvis Presley , coming toward me , I 'd have to cross to the other side . " " Why ? " " I 'd be afraid of him , that 's why . I 'm afraid of hoods and so are you ! " " I 'm going to enter in secret . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you talk about to a twenty-two-year-old low-class hood ? " " I ca n't think of anything right now . " " Oh , this is just so stupid , there 'll probably be a chaperone anyway . They 're not letting any young innocent girls be alone with a sex fiend like that . He 's not your type , you know . He likes cheap slutty girls like those stupid baton-twirlers and he would n't understand you . You 'd have to cut off your long blond hair and get a pageboy fluff . You 'd have to wear lipstick , pink lipstick . " " Do n't you have any man you admire from afar ? " " Yes , I do . Senator Kennedy . But you 've never heard of him . I 'm saving his picture in a book . He 's being carried out of the hospital on a stretcher and he 's so cute . " She switched on the light and took out her book with the newspaper clippings . " Who 's the beautiful woman ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . And here 's a picture of them with their newborn baby , Caroline . See , he 's more our type . " " He is really cute but in a different way . " " It 's more subtle , it 's not just raw sex . " W HEN Love Me Tender came to town my friends and I decided to be first on line . We got there at 10 A.M. for the twelve o'clock show and we planned to stay all day . Actually the movie did not come to our town but to Far Rockaway , a shabby town near our richer , cleaner suburb . As it turned out we were second in line . Some tough older girls , natives of Far Rockaway , were ahead of us . It was winter , January 11th , and my mother kept saying to take hot soup . more sweaters , more food , more of all those kinds of things . We knew that food intake was not possible on such an occasion . My mother also said we were going much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . Take turns , let Daddy wait with you in the car until the time . " That was out of the question . What would one want with a father at a time like that ? By eleven the line was long , going all the way around the block , and we were cold and tired . I was surprised to see my father drive up in his dark green Buick . " Oh God , what does he want ? " I said . " Mommy sent this blanket , " he said . He had with him a small dark-blue plaid blanket with a fringe around the edge . It was the blanket that covered my baby carriage in my baby pictures in our album . I could n't bear to see it there at the opening of Love Me Tender . I just looked at it in revulsion , although it was a beautiful thing and I wish my mother would let me have it now , and I could n't believe what a stupid bungling thing it was to do , to send that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From age one to twelve is a whole lifetime , I thought . and I was right because it was my whole life . But now , twelve years ago I was twenty . At twenty , almost two twelves had gone by . Twelve years is not so long ago now , I was almost the same as I am today . I guess my parents thought they had just gotten the blanket twelve years ago and had been using it for this or that purpose ever since . Too bad I did n't understand anything then . " Oh , Daddy , " I said , " I do n't want that . " " Mommy says you 'll catch cold . " " I 'm not cold . Nobody here has a blanket . " " They take blankets to football games , do n't they ? " ' , This is n't like a football game . " " Just take it , so I can say I gave it to you . You do n't have to use it . " " Oh . Daddy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fold it up and hold it , " he said . I took it and watched him walk off in his brown felt hat and his black-and-green-checked reversible lumber jacket . I thought he was some alien being . When he had driven away , Karen and Elinor did some stupid things with the blanket . They put it over their heads , they wrapped it around their hips , they did a bullfight with it . After a while we sat down on the sidewalk and when we got cold we covered our legs with it . We sat in the first row and we could hardly see his face . Then we moved to the fifth row and finally to the tenth . Too bad it was a Western . Was n't everything a Western in those days ? Or half the things anyway ? He did n't fit into a Western and I did n't see why they could n't make a movie of him as his own self . The movie was really disappointing . The song , though , was so beautiful , to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always cry . What am 1 crying for , for him or for me ? For my childhood or his youth , I ca n't be sure . I guess they go together . There was something so frustrating about that movie . We got to see him and stare at him up close and in detail but it was n't enough . It just made me want more of him , the real Elvis in flesh and blood . " Would you be one of those girls who tears his clothes and touches his skin ? " my sister asked when I got home . " I do n't like to be in big wild crowds , " I said . " Then you 'll never get close enough to meet him . " " Fan , " my father said , " comes from the word fanatic . Do you realize that ? " " How could you sit through it for eight hours ? " my mother asked . " That 's how people get sick , breathing in all those germs in dark movies . Go drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank juice only for breakfast . The whole day was gone , it was so dark when we came out of the theater . It was a lost empty day of my life . I saw him and I saw him but I did n't really see him . f OR MY THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY my sister gave me an album called " Elvis . " One thing about her is that she always gets people exactly what they want even if she hates it herself . It was the best present I 've ever gotten and I still have it . He looked beautiful on the cover , in profile  --  in color  --  mouth opened , head back singing , and wearing a lavender shirt . He was holding his guitar and his forehead was wrinkled so earnestly . " My God , " my sister said , examining the picture . " He has light-brown hair , not black ! See for yourself . He must dye his hair black . " My sister always knows the inside story about people before everyone figures it out , but nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " Jacqueline Kennedy has naturally kinky hair . She has it straightened . I can see it always growing out frizzy , like a Negro 's . " Next she told me that John Kennedy had many girl friends , some of them college age , and one of them Marilyn Monroe . I did n't believe any of these things . When my sister was in college I read a page in her college humor magazine with a long list of awards to famous people . " To Elvis , Presley : The Most Odious Bellow of Puberty . " " What does pooberty mean ? " I asked . " Pewberty , silly . Pewberty . I ca n't wait to tell everybody how you pronounced it . It means age of sexual maturity . Adolescence . Teenage . " " Oh , how disgusting . " The next summer at night in our bedroom , she said , " I have a confession to make to you . " " Yeah , what ? " " Remember you used to tell me how sexy Elvis Presley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But it 's what you meant . " " I did not . " " Well , ' cute ' , ' adorable ' , ' beautiful ' , ' handsome ' , how you thought he was just so great ? " " Yeah , so ? " " Well , I 've thought it over and I 've listened to a lot of his records and I 've come to the conclusion that you were right . Some kids at school got me to rethink my position and now I understand . " " What ? They like him in colleges ? " " The best colleges have a group of intellectuals and beats who understand him in a way . " " Not the real way though , I bet . " " I do . I really am getting to love him . " Who needed her to love him ? was what I thought . Who needed all these intellectual college kids adding themselves to his first true fans ? I tried to talk her out of it , but just for spite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my friends . She knew I did n't like it and she persisted . There was something I did n't understand in the way she was talking about him ; it was a kind of secret private savoring of his qualities in a way that seemed ? too enjoyable and even bad . She and her intellectual college friends must have all done some sex by then and talked about how sexy he was and how he just exuuuuuded sex from every pore , every note , every expression , everything , sex , sex , sex . That 's what they did in those best colleges at the end of the Fifties I guess . When Elvis got married , in 1967 , my sister 's roommate , an intellectual filmmaker , said to me , " Have you seen his wife ? I ca n't believe it . She looks exactly like him . " She said this in a mean way , although by then I was advanced far enough along in life not to be bothered . What did it matter to me anyway whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was old enough to get married myself by then and did marry a few years after he did . I knew he was in another world , wore white satin suits , jeweled capes , black leather suits , ate thick steaks and drank Coca-Cola . There was no future for us together , I was sure . I had read the year before that when asked why he did n't marry , he had said , " Why buy the cow if you can get milk through the fence ? " Now I 'm sure he did n't say that , but at the time I thought it was true . I was going through a cynical and bitter phase I guess . I 'd already met John Kennedy by 1960 and that was keeping Elvis off my mind . Not just met , but met and exchanged pleasantries with . " Pleasantries indeed , " said my sister 's boyfriend . " Everyone in Cambridge tells me what he 's like . I want you to see it was more exciting than you thought . " It was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around anymore , old and gray , divorced and scandalized , to compare the golden moment with . The John F. Kennedy moment . I spent one of his half dollars today . I had to use all my change to buy an Elvis Presley record , what could I do ? That 's right ! We 're not to dwell morbidly on those days , are we ? People are simply marching forward with the 1970s now , expecting the very worst . Though they can not imagine them because their imaginations fall far short of the task , as things happen they take them in stride , knowing our present times are composed of a series of dreadful events . Go forth , men of the world , lead your own little lives ; work , fail , succeed , buy a Harris tweed sports jacket , discover new restaurants , grow your hair long , cut it short , and come home , sit back , and watch the news . I WAS LUCKY , though , because I listen to the news so much and so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of Elvis Presley 's health problems . From time to time we hear of this or that famous person being hospitalized for an " undisclosed ailment , " and we have learned to expect that soon it will be announced that that person is dead . Of course if it were a harmless ailment it would be disclosed . Yes , there is only one ailment that is not disclosed , but no one need worry for fear it will be mentioned here . No. we have gotten together for a good time , for an old-fashioned tale with a happy ending . That 's why when I heard Elvis Presley was in trouble I moved fast . I was lying on the Oriental rug doing my exercises when I heard that he was " hospitalized with intestinal difficulties . " I quickly got up . I looked at the announcer 's face to see if he knew more than he was saying , but it was Rolland Smith on CBS and he did n't even care . The next time I heard a report they said something even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enough of these news stories to know that one or two things follow that  --  one is surgery , and the other is death . In this case they said nothing about surgery , only that he 'd be released the next day . That is always a bad sign , as we all know . I wondered whether someone like Elvis Presley did not have people around him who were smart enough to keep the hospital from giving out such information . How dare they discuss his digestive system on national TV ? I thought that perhaps since Elvis is such a completely honest and innocent boy he might have just said , " Tell ' em the truth . " He might not be sophisticated enough to be thinking of how things sound and how they will he interpreted . This is an ugly world , Elvis , I wanted to tell him , especially the world of newscasters . But he must have known all about that , must n't he ? After these two health reports I heard a critic give a review of an Elvis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how awful he looked and how he did n't look himself , and then he topped it all with . " Come on , Elvis , YOU ARE FAT . Shape up , be the idol you once were , you 're just fat now . " Does anyone ever wonder how Elvis Presley might feel hearing something like that , that particular thing , YOU ARE FAT , announced to him over the airwaves for millions of people to hear ? Is n't there any compassion for him anywhere , and does n't it occur to anybody that he needs help ? The next night a movie was on television showing him on tour in 1970 . What could I have been doing in 1970 that was so important that I had missed this film ? I never even knew he looked like that , that he 'd let his thick straight hair fall forward into his face and that he was so thin the dimples in his cheeks had become huge deep dents . I did n't know his lean hard body slipped around underneath his white jumpsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened bare down to his waist . Why did I give up on him just because he wore white jeweled jumpsuits and capes that were n't 100-percent cotton or probably any part cotton at all ? Surely his underwear was cotton , but it looked as if he was n't wearing any . He was a scared sweet boy who was nervous and breathless before he went on stage . He took songs that I hated , songs from Tom Jones and junk like You Do n't Have to Say You Love Me , he took these songs and put them through himself , through his mind and through his body and through his voice , and they came out beautiful . He was magic . He was a god , not just a king . What could ever have been more important to me than Elvis Presley ? I do n't know why I wasted my time in cols* lege reading existentialism when there was Elvis . I should have put all my energy into meeting him . Why did n't I ? I ca n't be blamed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible movies , and neither can he . But it 's no wonder I had to take some brief respite from my adoration of him . I ca n't help it if at age fifteen I did n't know what to do about Elvis Presley . Could n't I have learned ? ... no , all was forbidden to teenagers in 1960 . I believed it was anyway . Believing and truth-telling are the bad habits of youth , they lead nowhere . They 've led me here , sitting in an old flannel nightgown with a crocheted blanket around me as I stare at him in black-and-white TV when I 'm just two years over thirty . The time was here and now it 's gone . You see , that 's the trick of life , is n't it cruel ? The Time Is Past . Touch them while you can , Elvis Presley and John Kennedy too . I went into the bedroom when the film was over and I said to my husband , " I have to help get Elvis on a better diet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snoring too . My husband watches football and drinks beer , I went to Radcliffe and I love Elvis Presley . We come from Alabama and we sell apples . He did n't apply to Harvard but he went to Yale . What good does any of it do us , if I can not get to Elvis ? That he might die and John Denver should live ; why should a rat , a snail , a roach have life and he no breath at all ? The next day ' I said to my husband , " I have got to meet Elvis Presley now . " " Do n't you think you 're going too far ? " " John Davidson is healthy but Elvis Presley is ailing in Tennessee . " " I thought it was John Denver you hated . " " Are n't they the same person ? " " Your wit is intact anyway . " " They might as well be the same person . No , one is a natural ass and the other works at it . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sister wishes so hard she had met John Kennedy . " " So you 're both nuts . The doom and gloom sisters . " I WANTED ELVIS to take me seriously , 1 wanted him to respect my mind . I did n't want to be just some annoying crazy fan . Even though I knew those fans were treated well by him . I saw cheap slutty women , young and old , being touched and kissed by him at his concert tours . That meant he did n't have such high standards , he 'd kiss anyone . These girls and women with their breasts pushed up high out the tops and sides of their dresses would tell reporters how they had seen every concert , how they had traveled thousands of miles , how they had met him twice or three times , and how it was the most exciting moment of their lives . Perhaps these cheap low-class women knew something I did n't know . " You have plenty of time to meet Elvis , " my husband said . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying in bed in the style known as glued to the television , and he did n't even look away from his sports event as he spoke . " Look , I 'm in a hurry , " I said . " It sounds as if he 's really in trouble . " " Someone else can get to him . " " Who ? I can get him a juicer , he 'll go on a juice fast , I 'll convert him to vegetarianism and exercise . Who else can save him ? " " Well , certainly not you . How could you get to him ? " " I could get famous . Fast . " " Fine . Co write pornography . I 've been telling you that for six years . " " I 'm sure he does n't read pornography . " " Sure he does . Everybody does now . " " We do n't . " " I have to get around to it . " " That 's not how people feel about pornography . " " I want to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I write the way I write ? " " It 'll take too long to get famous that way . You have to be shocking . Be mean . Be the goddess of meanness . " " That would n't appeal to Elvis Presley . " " No , but you 'd get on TV . " " But he would n't know how much I love him . " " Johnny Carson could introduce you . " " Elvis probably would n't want to meet me because he 's so kind . " " He would n't want to meet you because you 're not cheap . He likes his women cheap . " " He would have a different compartment for me . " " Why should he ? What 's in it for him ? " " Curiosity . He likes to know what 's going on in the world . " " Not your kind of world . " " Well , maybe I could get cheap . " " You could never be cheap enough . " " I could wear a gold bikini . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wearing it go to your desk and write some pornography . " " Why wo n't you take this seriously ? " " Shhh . This is the most exciting moment of the game . " " Well ? " " Well what ? " " Why wo n't you take this seriously ? " " Hmmm ? What ? Take what seriously ? Oh , Elvis ? Because it 's not really serious . " OME Nu-atm after my husband falls asleep I creep out of bed and float into the living room so I can hear Elvis sing . I 'm wearing my long flannel nightgown that 's soft and faded light blue and I sink down into the wicker armchair at the end of the big room where the sound from the speakers is intended to be best . I sit , just sit and listen . Sometimes I put my head back and I can feel the hard wicker edge digging into my head , but I do n't care . It does n't bother me . There 's a window right behind me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with junkies and drunks and loonies of every kind . I never used to sit in that chair because I know that at any moment one of these hotel guests might take a shotgun and begin blowing out the windows of my apartment building . But I do n't worry anymore . It would n't be a bad way to go , to get my head blown off listening to Elvis Presley sing . Why sleep when I can hear his voice , deep and hoarse and wild with energy , calling to me , One Night With You ? Why sleep when I can hear that voice , and how can I sleep if I hear it when it is n't even playing ? Until recently I had never heard Are You Lonesome Tonight . I had never been to King Karol Records or Discorama or Discomania. and I made sure to cross to the other side of the street when I got near Crazy Eddie 's . But now I 've been everywhere and bought everything . I have all his songs . I 've talked to the salespersons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet , and I 've bought a new needle from someone who had n't even been born when I first heard Elvis sing in 1956 . She did n't exist in 1956 and I had to ask her when they 'd be getting Live From Las Vegas . I was stunned when I heard Are You Lone ' some Tonight and I had to cry as I listened . I had lived all these years without hearing him sing Are You Lonesome Tonight . My husband has dared to dance around and snap his fingers to Elvis singing while I am listening alone in my room . I just look away quickly , but I 've felt a terrible hatred for him and even a desire to stab him . I must control my anger for I know I am a crazy bitch with a violent temper to boot .

We had to proceed , and go to our vacation house because it was costing so much to rent . I could have wasted the money . I could have stopped everything  --  gone to my room with my records and gone insane right then . But it was summer , and we owe it to ourselves to get the most out of summer . Fall too . In spring we may all flip out . In winter deep depressions are permitted for everyone . But not in August . I had to buy corn . Slice tomatoes . Cut basil . Bake peach pie . Ride a bike .

It was the feeling in his voice , in his sweet voice , the combination of sexiness and sweetness and fun  --  it was all in good fun . Except when he sang Love Me Tender  --  then he was sincere , sweetly sincere , but his deep sweet voice still had the promise of fun and sex . Sex , not as we all know it today , but as we imagined it at age twelve in 1956 . That 's ? the beauty of Elvis Presley , when I tried at age twelve to have a fantasy about him it was too confusing .

There had never been a voice like that . I did n't know what came after the kiss , it went on forever . I think I was wearing a long white chiffon nightgown that blew in the breeze , but what was he wearing ? Black chino pants , and that lavender shirt , I think . The collar was not turned up . HAVE TRIED TO LIVE a normal life . I 've tried , I 've tried to blot it out , shut it away , but something pulls me to him . He pulls me to him , his voice , his face , his eyes , his hands , his legs , his body , his sweet smile . I 'm his . He 's mine . He 's ours and he 's no one 's . He 's here and he 's gone . But I live in the real world . Who are the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are they connected to the brain ? The brain , in part , is composed of metal spokes , and immediately upon arising the spokes begin whirling . None of the things they said about Elvis Presley were true . I mean none of the bad things were true , not true at all . He did not dye his hair . It was light brown but he did not dye it ; it just photographed black . He was very tall and not fat , but weighed a trifle more than he should have . Those pictures of a bloated puffy person were not him , they were not even a person at all , they were those inflatable dummies that you pump up , it was a cruel trick of his many rivals and detractors . Elvis Presley is alive . I did save his life . He did get a juicer and he juiced organically grown apples and carrots and spinach and wheat grass and he got thin and healthy . He grew his own vegetables , went jogging and bike-riding and swimming . He remarried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with his long lean body , down to the green grass , and lifted up his little girl into the blue sky and swung her around as they all three laughed and jumped for joy . They had two more babies , a boy and a girl . Priscilla went to art school and became a great primitive painter , and they lived happily ever after . It 's a wonderful world . My wish came true . I did get to touch him . I touched his hands , I touched his face , we hugged . we kissed , I kissed his hands . I kissed his face , I touched his face , I touched his arms , I touched his eyes , I touched his hair , I saw his smile , I heard his voice , I saw him move , I heard him laugh , l heard him sing . We 're the best of friends now and he sometimes tells me that I saved his life , but I know it was n't just me . It was all of us , alI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one of millions . We wanted to save him , we needed him , we loved him so much . I was just a little crazier than most , smarter too , and because I understood his greatness I knew he had to live , to last , to be happy , to thrill millions , and I could n't let anything stop me. ?
