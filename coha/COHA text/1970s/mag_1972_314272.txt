It has long been believed-especially in France-that the French more or less invented sex and even enjoy a monopoly on it , or at least on some of its more exquisite nuances . But now , 24 years after Alfred C. Kinsey published the first of his pioneering reports on the sexual habits of Americans , a team of French scholars has actually got around to studying sex in the land of I'amour . The result , published this week , is a massive 922-page Report on the Sexual Behavior of the French , whose findings are as surprising as were Kinsey 's disclosures in 1948 . Judging by the sample of 2,625 men and women , both married and single , who were interviewed for the report , the French are in fact far more conservative and less imaginative in their lovemaking than they hitherto suspected . <P> Although every true Frenchman is popularly supposed to have a mistress , some 70% of the husbands polled and 90% of the wives asserted that they had never been unfaithful to their spouses . Moreover , 50% of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , the French women declared that they had been to bed with no more than two men in their lives , while men admitted to intercourse with less than a dozen women , including prostitutes . The myth of the widespread cinq -- sept or cocktail-hour dalliance was also exploded ; 82% of both sexes said that they make love at night before going to sleep , 11% choose the morning and only 7% indulge in the afternoon . More than 95% of men and women who participated in the interview overwhelmingly favor intercourse in the classic position , with the male on top of the supine female . But they scarcely ever do it , in any position , on Mondays and Tuesdays , which for some unfathomable reason are erotic deserts . <P> Still , couples in their 20s reported that they make love on an average of five times a week , apparently excluding Mondays and Tuesdays , while those in their 50s have intercourse nine times a month . For 24% the sexual act itself lasts 15 to 44 minutes , far longer than the five to nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . About 45% of the women ( but only 19% of the men ) said that they prefer to make love in total darkness . According to the report , the volubility of Frenchmen extends even to lovemaking . The majority of men talk during intercourse , while their partners are more silent-so much so that 64% of the men expressed the wish that the women would speak up more .
