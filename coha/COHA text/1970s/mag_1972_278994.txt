A True Happening <P> Sir / The Democratic Convention , as reported and illustrated in TIME July 24 , appeared to be nothing less than a true happening . All advance signs of the forthcoming Republican Convention indicate it will probably be one long dental appointment . <P> <P> SID SKOLNIK <P> Encino , Calif . <P> <P> Sir / At least George McGovern would n't think he had been elected President of the whole world . <P> Spending our resources to make this country what it should be will export more democracy , if that is our goal , than continuous foreign intervention and involvement . <P> <P> DANIEL EAST <P> Peoria , Ill . <P> <P> Sir / As a first-time voter and a McGovern volunteer , I am really becoming fed up with political analysts telling the world that I am going to become disillusioned with Senator McGovern for modifying his position on some issues between now and November . <P> I am not trying to elect some self-righteous dictator who scorns any change or ideas different from his own . That is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a good and decent man become President of this country , and I trust McGovern 's judgment in any necessary compromise with different factions of our nation . <P> <P> ELIZABETH DALY <P> Hartford , Conn . <P> <P> Sir / TIME describes George McGovern 's triumph in Miami Beach as a miracle . <P> In a way , it is as much so as the miracle of the volcanic eruption on Krakatoa , or the miracle of Hurricane Agnes , or the miracles of the many other disasters that have devastated numerous areas of the world at various times throughout history . <P> <P> ROBERT E. WALTERS <P> Columbus <P> Sir / George McGovern must be stupidly naive if he honestly expects Hanoi to give us back our P.O.W.s . No amount of begging will do it . Two reasons : first . North Viet Nam 's wish to humiliate the U.S. ; and second , its desire to obtain reparations , which I 'd call ransom . The price will come high . <P> If McGovern wins , our nation will have turned full circle . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent for defense . " <P> <P> N.B. DISMUKES <P> Dallas <P> Sir / Someone should tell Senator " Share the Wealth and Emasculate the Commonwealth " McGovern that we no longer live in Sherwood Forest . <P> <P> MRS . M.L. BILSBOROUGH <P> West Lafayette , Ind . <P> <P> Sir / Your coverage of the Democratic Convention suggests that history is once more repeating itself , this time after 760 years . <P> The McGovern campaign is another Children 's Crusade , as foolish as the first and equally destined to fail . <P> <P> HERMAN W. LIEBERT <P> New Haven , Conn . <P> <P> Sir / In reading your account of the sources of several of the phrases in Candidate McGovern 's acceptance speech , I was curious about the inspiration for the " Come home . America " theme . As a Methodist P.K. ( preacher 's kid ) of McGovern 's generation , I recall singing many times the gospel-hymn chorus that goes : <P> Come home , come home , <P> Ye who are weary , come home ; <P> Earnestly , tenderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home . <P> <P> JOANNAS . BURRIS <P> Pemberton , N.J. <P> <P> Nobel for Nixon ? <P>
