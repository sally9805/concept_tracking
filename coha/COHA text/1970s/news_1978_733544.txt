txt A Federal court today ordered Bert Lance , the former Budget Director , and nine of his associates to clarify their subterranean relationship with Financial General Bankshares Inc . In addition , four of the associates are to make restitution to former stockholders in the company . The order settles a suit filed late yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which charged Mr. Lance and his associates , four of them wealthy Arabs , with violating Federal securities laws in allegedly seeking to secretly obtain a controlling interest in the $2.2 billion bank holding company . The suit contained the first allegation by a Federal agency that Mr. Lance might have violated his pledge to a Senate committee last year that he would not become involved in private banking or banking policy , issues while he was director of the Office of Management and Budget .. Aided Takeover Effort The S.E.C. said that while in office Mr. Lance aided a successful previous effort to ' acquire control of the Washington-based , holding company , although there was no sign in the suit that Mr. Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He resigned last September because of controversy surrounding his banking practices before his appointment and is still a close friend and adviser of President Carter . Under the settlement , which was accepted by both the S.E.C. and the 10 defendants , the four Arab associates and any others who wish to participate must either purchase all shares in the company at an above-market price within a year or sell all their stock . This provision and the sweeping relief that was provided for Financial General stockholders who sold shares to the associates were considered unusually stringent penalties for a case involving alleged violation of the disclosure provisions of the securities laws , The charge was failure to disclose the group 's purchase of about 20 percent of the company 's stock ; Federal law requires that purchases of 5 percent or more of the shares in a publicly traded company be reported within 10 days to stock exchanges and the S.E.C. J. W. Middendorf 2d. the president of Financial General , who is a former Secretary of the Navy , also agreed to a settlement of S.E.C. charges that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with the purchase of the company by a group which he headed and which , according the S.E.C. , Mr. Lance helped form . The S.E.C. complaint said that in spring of 1977 ? within weeks of his confirmation hearings and his pledge to stay out of banking matters  --  Mr. Lance held the first of several meetings with Mr. Middendorf and retired Army Gen. George Almsted . The S.E.C. said the discussions centered on Mr. Olmsted 's intention to sell his controlling interest in Financial General . " Olmsted introduced Lance to Middendorf in order that Lance might assist Middendorf in assembling a group to purchase the FG.B. stock , " the complaint said . The sale was completed April 29 . As a result of today 's settlement , Mr. Lance 's assets in Financial General , which controls 13 banks in four states and the District of Columbia , will be frozen ; he will not be permitted to sell or transfer any of his shares in the company to any of his associates unless the formal offer to take control of the company make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altman , attorney for Mr. Lance , described the settlement as " fair and reasonable . " He said that he filed today the requisite disclosures about the stock purchases with the S.E.C. for Mr. Lance and seven of his codefendants , including the four Arabs . Mr. Altman denied that Mr. Lance and the other investors were acting as a group . He emphasized , however , that the settlement did not preclude Mr. Lance 's participation in a tender offer to purchase the outstanding shares of Financial General , although he was not specifically named in that portion of the settlement . Mr. Lance and his associates neither confirmed nor denied the S.E.C. charges ; this is standard practice in S.E.C. settlements . However . they agreed to several actions designed to provide restitution to Finanial General stockholders who sold their shares to the Lance group earlier this year . Aaree to Make Cash Offer Specifically , three Arab defendants and the International Credit and Investment Company ( Overseas ) Ltd. have agreed to make a cash tender offer " as promptly as practicable " for " any and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $15 a share . The stock closed at $11% on the American Stock Exchange last Friday , but the minimum offer was set at $15 because the Lance group offered a Financial General stockholder , $15 for his shares while they were allegedly seeking to gain control . International Credit and Investment , a Grand Cayman Island corporation , controls the Bank of Credit and Commerce International , a codefendant in the suit . The bank and the corporation are controlled by Agha Hasan Abedi. a Pakistaniborn banker who is also a defendant . The S.E.C. complaint also sheds new lieht on Mr. Lance 's relationship with Mr. Abedi and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International . The complaint states that in October 1977. the month after Mr. lance resigned . " Lance and Abedi agreed upon an arrangement whereby . for a substantial fee , Lance would render advice on securities and other investments . including investments in banks , to B.C.C.I. and-or its affiliates . " The complaint added . " Since the fall of 1977 , Lance has obtained substantial personal leans that were arranged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender offer or sell their shares are Sheikh Karnal Adham , the former chief of intelligence of Saudi Arabia , Faisal Saud al Fulaij , a Kuwaiti businessman , and Abdullah Darwaish , an adviser to the royal family in Abu Dhabi . These three and Sheikh Sultan Bin Zaid al Nahyan , the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi , who is. a codefendant , have agreed to establish a $1 million fund from which Financial General stockholders who sold their shares to the so-called " Lance group " can file claims for reparations . A stockholder who sold his shares on the open market to members of the Lance group could seek to obtain the cash difference between the price he obtained and the $15 court-approved minimum offer . If ? a cash offer to take control of the company is not made within a year , the defendants must " utilize their best efforts " to sell their stock within the following year . If anyone else makes a takeover offer in excess of $15 a share , the defendants must exceed the bid or sell to the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Mr. Lance . who owns 13,000 shares of Financial General in his wife 's name , have agreed not to sell or transfer their shares to any . other defendant until a tender offer has been successfully made , or an agreement to sell the group 's 20 percent interest in the company has been reached . Reserve Not Notified It is unclear whether the Arab investors would actually be able to obtain approval from Federal banking authorities for the takeover bid stipulated in the settlement . Mr. Lance . and his associates now control 28 percent of Financial General 's stock . According to the Bank Holding Company Act , any group seeking to acquire control ( generally regarded as more than 25 percent ) of a hank holding company must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board . None of the defendants had notified the Federal Reserve of the stock purchases . The order signed today by Judge Oliver Gasch also bars the defendants from further violations of the securitieh laws . Those consenting to the settlement today were Mr. Lance : Jackson T. Stephens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heads : Mr. Abedi and the Rank of Credit and Commerce International , which he heads : Sheikh Adham : Mr. al Fulaij : Mr. Darwaish : . Sheikh al Nahyan ; Eugene J.
