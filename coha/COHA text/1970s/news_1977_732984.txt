txt Letters : Readers Rise To Defense of Cancun pg . 345 Letters : Readers Rise To Defense of Cancun To the Editor : As hundreds of us were fighting our way to Kennedy Airport through the snow for our departure to Hotel Cancun Caribe recently , news of Ralph Blumenthal 's article , " The Hostelries and Beaches of Modern Cancun " ( Travel Section , Feb. 20 ) , spread among us , raising some serious doubts as to whether we should proceed to our destination . But now , having completed a week 's stay , I can report for the Cancun Caribe group that our high expectations were not disappointed , that we think Mr. Blumenthal wrong . How , then , account for his report ? For one thing , he went to Cancun out of season , when the weather is less reliable . For another , he contracted turista , and with turista , nothing comes up to expectations . The article , then , was Ralph Blumenthal 's revenge on Montezuma . I am sure Cancun will recover . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. REESE To the Editor : We recently returned from a week in Cancun and we were unable to recognize the Cancun we had visited in reading the article by Ralph Blumenthal . He found Cancun , despite its perfect beaches , clear surf , strong sun and hotels with good service , to be " disappointingly prosaic  --  haphazard and sterile . " We found it to be " an island of unspoiled beaches , " just as our brochures promised  --  and so much more . The miles of beach stretching from the last hotel , the Garza Blanca , to the Club Med , are practically uninhabited . The only populated parts of the island from the Convention Center to the Club Med were in front of Mr. Blumenthal 's hotel , the Aristos , and the Caribe . Mr. Blumenthal failed to mention the wildlife which proliferates on the island . Iguanas climb the rocks outside the hotel rooms , as do the salamanders . The pelicans are a never-ending wonder as they swoop down to catch fish . We even saw a pet anteater a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to mention the wealth of tropical plants , such as one with strange leaves which are magenta on one side and green on the other . Nor did he make note of the tropical fish , just inches below the water surface . All the beauties are right there to be seen . Mr. Blumenthal further complained that the jungle ( around the airport ) has been denuded by the construction . The island itself is more like a desert ? naturall , quite fascinating and beautiful , and not spoiled at all . He said that the hotels block views and easy access to the ocean ; only a person with a car mentality would need a view of the ocean from the road . Having the road on the lagoon side , I think , preserves the purity of the ocean view . Mr. Blumenthal also found most of the souvenirs eminently forgettable . If he could only put himself into a Cancun mode of thinking , he would wonder why he was looking for souvenirs at all . Wilton , Conn . MARIE HODGES Ross To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-day stay similar to that described by Ralph Blumenthal in his story of Cancun , and I would like to make a few additional observations . We also stayed at the Hotel Aristos and noted that the hotel does not have elevators  --  which might be important for the elderly or disabled . To go to Cancun and not visit the principal Mayan ruins is undoubtedly blasphemous , but we would make a compromise suggestion if time is short . Chichen Itza is an awesome experience , but , it is possible to eliminate a tiresome six-hour ride and still see another excellent and most beautiful example of the Mayan culture . We rented a Volkswagen ( approximately $11 a day plus nine cents a mile ) and took the road south to Tulum , spectacular ancient walled Mayan city which looks over the cliffs to the Caribbean . On the return trip we recommend snorkeling or swimming in the lagoons at Xhel-Ha and stopping to see the beach at Akumal , one of the most beautiful we have seen anywhere . Locust , N.J. FRANK A. CONTEY 3D ZOO STORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family Trek Across Asia " ( Travel Section , Jan. 2 ) // that the Delhi zoo was empty when she and her family visited it . A possible reason for this , she noted , was that Indians might not want to look at animals who are better fed than people . Mrs. Zorn should know that we went to that same zoo last Dec. 2 , which happened to be a holiday in India , and found it extremely crowded . Hundreds of families were there for the day with picnic lunches , and there was a long wait for space on the train which takes passengers around the zoo . In visiting zoos around the world , we have found that most of them are empty on work days , which are also school days , and well-populated with humans on holidays . This makes them more interesting to visit on holidays if you want to see how people enjoy their spare time in other lands . SHIRLEY WEISS Stony Brook , N.Y . BETTY HUNTER A NEW EQUATION To the Editor : Hall T. Sprague 's formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jan. 16 ) prompts me to submit mine based on what I call the Interest Distance Factor . It is my thesis that the Pleasure Value of a sightseeing objective is the dividend of its intrinsic Interest divided by its Distance from the would-be sightseer . ( PV = I D ) Thus , while Iguassu Falls , on the border between Argentina and Brazil , are higher , wider and more beautiful than Niagara Falls , the latter 's proximity makes it a better value for anyone in the United States . Employing this formula when we lived in Mexico City , we often took visitors to Cuicuilco , the oldest pyramid in the region , near the university , rather than make the three-hour trip to see the pyramids of the Sun and the Moon . Except to a confirmed archeologist , a pyramid is a pyramid , is a pyramid . The converse of the formula is that sights which have extraordinary interest will draw visitors even if they require long , expensive trips . This explains why Europe with its architectural , artistic and hereditary interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURKE San Diego , Calif . MACHU PICCHU To the Editor : In his otherwise comprehensive story on Machu Picchu , " Where Time Stands Still " ( Travel Section , Jan. 30 ) , Roger Ahrens mentions that Lima , Peru , the starting point for a journey to Machu Picchu , can be reached by air from Miami on Aero Peru . He neglected to mention that the Louts J. GARCIA New York Braniff International TUNISIA To the Editor : Regarding the article by Robert J. Dunphy " What 's Doing in Tunisia ( Travel Section , Jan. 30. ) , we also found car travel in Tunisia to be pleasant and trouble free . The roads were good and the gasoline stations strategically located . The people are friendly and helpful ? in French , English or Arabic . The highlight of our holiday in Tunisia was a day in Kairouan , which is about 40 miles from Sousse . The walls of this holy city date from the 11th century and the great mosque dates from 826 A.D.
