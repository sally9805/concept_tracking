txt White House officials view Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin 's coming visit to Washington for a hastily arranged meeting with President Carter as a positive development . The sudden announcement of Mr. Begin 's trip to the United States has been accompanied , in the meantime , by a rise in optimism among Carter administration officials over the possible results of the current Egyptian and Israeli peace initiatives . " Basically , what Begin is coming to talk about is something that 's positive , " said a White House official , who declined to go into further details before Mr. Begin 's arrival here for talks beginning Dec. 16 . " It 's good news . " // From page 1 Washington outlook on Begin American officials are pleased , for one thing , because the Begin visit reaffirms the importance of the United States to the Middle East peacemaking process . Now that Egypt 's President Anwar al-Sadat and Mr. Begin are the ones who are taking the initiative , the American role may not be as central as it once was . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being placed completely on the sidelines : For example : ? During his meetings with President Carter , Prime Minister Begin is expected to lobby for U.S. support for the positions which the Israelis will take at the meetings with the Egyptians which opened in Cairo on Dec. 14 . ? In the long run , both Egypt and Israel are likely to look to the U.S. to underwrite with political , economic , and possibly even military guarantees any agreements which may eventually emerge . ? Both sides also see a continuing need for the United States to use its superpower status to offset Soviet moves directed against their peace initiatives . ? And Egypt and Israel are expected to call on the United States , as President Sadat put it in an interview with the magazine U.S. News and World Report , " to step in whenever a hitch develops . " Mr. Sadat said in the interview that the Americans " made the difference " in the negotiations for a disengagement agreement with the Israelis in 1973 and that they are in the same way bound to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelis and the Arabs in the current situation . U.S. officials are also pleased that both Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin put so much stress on their personal contacts with President Carter . " One thing which people have underestimated in this whole process is how deeply all of these guys are impressed with Carter , " said one administration official . " Even Assad , " he said , referring to Syria 's President Hafez al-Assad , " is making no bones about that . " But Mr. Assad is being less than accommodating to American wishes at the moment . The Syrian President was reported to have told U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance on Dec. 13 that Syria not only will not attend the preliminary Egyptian-sponsored Middle East peace talks now under way in Cairo but also might not attend any reconvened Geneva peace conference , if that stemmed from the Cairo talks . The United States has been urging the Syrians , despite their disagreements with Egypt . to keep their options open so that they can eventually enter full-scale peace negotiations with Israel . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of Syrian participation at any time in the near future . Some diplomats have become convinced , in the meantime , that it will not be possible to bring Syria into the negotiating process unless Israel demonstrates a willingness to make concessions to the Arabs in return for the bold risk President Sadat has already taken through his precedent-shattering trip to Israel . Mr. Assad is apparently convinced that there is little real " give " in the Israeli positions on the key questions of occupied territory and Palestinian rights . But Mr. Vance is reported to have found a new " flexibility " in Israel on his current Middle East tour . Some diplomats think Mr. Begin will offer the Arabs , among other things , some kind of " autonomy " for the Palestinian Arabs on the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River ? but under Israeli military control . This seemed to be confirmed by the state-controlled Israeli Radio on Dec. 14 when it reported that Israeli concessions would include the granting of " semiautonomous status " to the West Bank .
