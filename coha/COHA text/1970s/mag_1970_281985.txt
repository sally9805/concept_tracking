While the victorious Allies have marked V-E day each year with parades and speeches , the enormity of Germany 's guilt and shame has imposed an anguished silence upon that country . Last week , 25 years after the Zusam-menbruch ( collapse ) of the Third Reich , West Germany 's first Social Democrat Chancellor broke with tradition . In a 21-minute speech to the Bundestag , Brandt declared that " no one is free from the history he has inherited . " <P> An anti-Nazi who fled Germany in 1933 , Brandt said that , while West Germany has become a respected and envied member of the family of nations , " we must not forget that the wounds of war have not vanished everywhere , that mistrust has not vanished everywhere , but indeed can be evoked in some people at the slightest cause . " Recalling that the war unleashed by Adolf Hitler cost the lives of " millions of children , women and men of many nations , " Brandt said : " We remember them all with reverence . The suffering resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past and to regard the securing of peace as the supreme aim of our political actions . " <P> Toward that end , Brandt said that West Germans must recognize that " facts have come into being during the past 25 years that we simply can not reverse . " Thus Brandt emphasized that he would be willing to sacrifice German claims to the lands east of the Oder-Neisse Line , which has demarcated the Polish-German border since the war 's end , in return for better relations with Poland . Brandt 's words were also intended for the East German Communist regime . Next week East German Premier Willi Stoph is scheduled to meet with Brandt in the West German city of Kassel in the second summit between the two Germanys .
