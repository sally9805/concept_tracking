txt WASHINGTON ? Four years ago the affluent society began to discover ; incredulously , widespread hunger amidst its plenty . Senators Joseph Clark and Robert Kennedy bore personal ? and angry ? witness to this fact after a trip through the hovels of the Mississippi Delta . Soon there arose a national demand for Federal action . The Government 's response , grudging at first , has accelerated . But a central question Ms persisted : Is it enough ? Three public panels have recently reviewed Federal programs to help the , hungry , and all have rendered similar answers . In the words of Mrs. Patricia Young , a leading national churchwoman from Scranton , Pa. : " Half-way to the moon would not be considered success and neither should feeding half our hungry . citizens . " President Nixon won considerable credit from all three studies ? a White House panel , a citizens ' board and the Senate Nutrition Committee ? for increasing Federal anti-hunger spending dramatically . President Johnson 's last budget provided $900-million to finance food programs for six million hungry people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 million people . An additional $500-million proposed for fiscal 1972 would enlarge the total number helped to near ? ly 16 million . But , as witnesses before the review panels pointed out , there are 24 million people living below the Federal poverty standard . At least eight million , therefore , would still go hungry at the end of fiscal 1972 . And so the witnesses asked , what has happened to the spirit of urgency , to President Nixon 's " national commitment to put an end to hunger and malnutrition due to poverty " ? That was one of two pledges made by the President in December , 1969 , at his massive White House Conference on Food , Nutrition and Health . The other was to hold a conference a year later . It was this followup conference Feb. 5 that triggered the current wave of attention to the hunger issue . The location , however , seemed more calculated to keep the lid on . " It was a candlelit closet in which to hide hunger , " one participant said of the foilow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in colonial Williamsburg for some 80 select participants . Many were sorrowed by the isolation , and at the end of the one-day session more than 20 joined in a rump meeting . The tenor of the formal and the rump sessions was severe : While the Administration deserves credit for what it has done , it must be more forthright ? and less frugal ? M recognizing how much remains to be done . These unexpectedly stern noises took some of the edge off the second review of the original ' White House ' conference . This was a meeting of the Citizens Board of Inquiry into Hunger , a broadly based body which helped generate the original attention to the issue . It ! net in Washington Feb. 15 . Where the Williamsburg conferees emphasized the need for more Federal funds , witnesses before the citizens board rise peatedly assailed the callowness of state and local food pro* ' gram administrators . The third round of reviewk came before George 's Senate Nutrition Committee , the papillae . But then the slide projector flickered and the gallery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a color picture of a bloated baby , with matchstick arms and legs , named Jesus . " He had maresmus calorie deficiency is bad as anything ever seen in Af. rica , " , Dr. Chase continued calmly . " He had scurvy , rickets , pneumonia and no detectable Vitamin C in this , blood . He was still at his birth weight after four and a half months . " , It was an extreme case , Dr. Chase acknowledged . But malnutrition serious enough to stunt growth and jeopardize mental development is widespread among migrant children . The hunger emergency sensed by the country four years ago , said Senator soberly , is far from over . ? JACK ** leading liberal forum for stronger action against hunger . Hearings to review the program concluded last week with Administration witnesses describing their record as one of " dramatic achievement . " What the committee found most dramatic , however , . was the largely technical testimony of Dr. H.
