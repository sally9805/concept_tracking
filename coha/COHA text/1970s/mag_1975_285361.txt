<P> Cairo and Jerusalem have often been on the same diplomatic wave length , but the words emanating from the two capitals have usually been bellicose or scornful . Last week their moods meshed again but , for a change , the tone was optimistic . Israeli leaders praised Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for the way he has switched home-front priorities from war planning to such economic goals as the reopening of the Suez Canal this spring . " If this tendency grows , " promised a key Israeli Cabinet minister , " we will concede a lot , although we will not be squeezed . " <P> In Cairo , Egyptian leaders who in December had damned Israeli proposals for further disengagement in Sinai were having kinder thoughts in January . They surmised that Israeli Premier Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Yigal Allon had initially put together an unacceptable package in order to mollify Israeli hawks and were now ready for serious bargaining . " The time is ripe for continued diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the area , " said Egyptian Information Minister Ahmad Kamal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Bird Calls . After the warlike words that have ricocheted through the Middle East in recent months , such hopeful statements were like bird calls on a battlefield . The optimism was underscored last week by an unusual series of high-level conferences in the area . Soviet Party Leader Leonid Brezhnev may have canceled his Middle Eastern trip for real or diplomatic reasons of health ( see story page 35 ) , but he was scarcely missed . The Shah of Iran , intent on reinforcing Arab ties , flew to Amman for two days with Jordan 's King Hussein and on to Cairo for five more days with President Sadat . <P> Syria 's President Hafez Assad and Lebanon 's President Suleiman Franjieh met briefly in the Lebanese town of Chtoura , a honeymoon resort that is the local equivalent of Niagara Falls . The setting was significant : though their discussions concerned the situation with Israel , the meeting was the first formal summit between leaders of the two often contentious neighbors since 1947 . Franjieh reportedly refused to allow Syrian troops inside his country short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military coordination " with Damascus . Even Israeli diplomats decided that the meeting had temporarily lessened tension along the northern border . <P> Raise Funds . Saudi Arabia 's King Faisal , a key figure in Middle East peace moves ( TIME MAN OF THE YEAR , Jan. 6 ) , was also scheduled to visit Damascus , Amman and probably also Cairo this week . In advance of his trip , the Saudi state radio announced a $756 million contract with the U.S. in which the King will buy 60 U.S. jets . The deal presumably would reinforce U.S.-Saudi relations , which are essential for peacemaking in the area . Israeli Foreign Minister Allon flew off once more to the U.S. , ostensibly to raise funds for Israel , but mainly to check with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about ways to turn all this hopeful talk into specific action .
