txt The Federal Reserve System is a mighty institution . Its chairman is one of Washington 's most powerful individuals and its impact on the economy , through the manipulation of credit and interest rates is immediate and far-reaching . It is surprising , therefore , to find that some people are deeply worried about the Fed 's abiding strength . In the the oast eight years . 430 small and medium-sized banks have left the Fed System to become state-chartered banks . To put its finger in the dike before too many more of the remaining 5,668 banks slip away , the Fed has proposed a profound change in the way the national banking system operates . It wants to pay member banks interest on the $38 billion of reserves they must hold and to charge these members for services now provided free . The basic proposal makes sense ? though the Fed 's rationale is somewhat flawed . The payment of interest and the sale of services would reduce the cost of Fed membership for some banks and improve the equity and efficiency of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep a portion of their deposits as reserves . The rest can be loaned Out . To influence the amount of credit in the economy , which is a key element of monetary policy ? the Fed alters the reserve requirement from time , to time . Instead of paying interest on these reserves , the Fed has provided services like check clearing , coin and currency , and electronic fund transfers to member banks . State banks , by contrast , may invest their reserves in safe , interest-bearing securities . For a fee , they can purchase Fed services from member banks . As interest rates have climbed , the cost of holding idle reserves has mounted and the attractiveness of Fed membership , especially for smaller , banks , has eroded . This situation should be remedied . It is unfair for financial institutions that compete against each other in the same marketplace to operate under such different reserve regulations- . It is also inefficient . The bundling of services provided free by the Fed tends to lead to less frugal use . Banks should pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drain on Fed membership is not very important . There is no proof for the claim that the Fed must maintain its ranks better to run monetary policy . That can be adequately managed through the large banks alone and they have shown no inclination to leave the system . They depend on Fed services for their.banking business . Others argue that the Fed must be protected also for its peculiar symbolic role in the fight against inflation . Somehow , this argument goes , the national economy is safer if the Fed chairman sits atop a large and stable rank of national banks . But the Fed 's role in policy debate has more to do with particular chairmen and their style than with the size of the system 's membership . ( It does need more complete and timely data on deposits in non-member institutions ? a need that several bills before the House Banking Committee would meet ) . Congress , in sum , should give the Fed what it wants , but not for the reasons the Fed offers . The survival of the Fed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . But equity and efficiency are at stake ? and they are reason enough .
