running away , then ? In the name of what ? More Arthurian legends and Icelandic sagas ? Look , if I were to empty my pockets of Elisabeth 's letters and Elisabeth 's photographs  --  and empty my imagination of Elisabeth 's father  --  if I were to give myself completely over to what I have , to whom I am with , to what may actually be my nature  --  " Do n't be ridiculous , " I say , " where can you find a room at this hour ? Oh , damn it , Gittan , I have to go to California alone ! I 've got to go back to school ! " In response , no tears , no anger , and no real scorn to speak of . Though not too much admiration for me as a shameless carnal force . She says from the door , " Why did I like you so much ? You are such a boy , " and that is all there is to the discussion of my character , all , apparently , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of mistresses and whores , not the precocious dramatist of the satyric and the lewd , and something of a fledgling rapist too  --  no , merely " a boy . " And then gently , so very gently ( for despite being a girl who moans when her hair is pulled and cries for more when her flesh is made to smart with a little pain , despite her Amazonian confidence in the darkest dives and the nerves of iron that she can display in the chancy hitchhiking world , aside from the stunning sense of inalienableright with which she does whatever she likes , that total immunity from remorse or self-doubt that mesmerizes me as much as anything , she is also courteous , respectful , and friendly , the perfectly broughtupchild of a Stockholm physician and his wife ) , she closes the door after her so as not to awaken the family from whom we have rented our room . Yes , easily as that do young Birgitta Svanstrom andp51young David Kepesh rid themselves of each other . Ridding himself of what he is by nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Kepesh does not appear to be that clear , quite yet , as to what his nature is , exactly . He is awake all night wondering what he will do if Birgitta should steal back into the room before dawn ; he wondersif he ought n't to get up and lock the door . Then when dawn arrives , when noon arrives , and she is nowhere to be found , neither in the town of Les Andelys nor in Rouen  --  not at the Grosse Horloge ; not at the Cathedral ; not at the birthplace of Flaubert or the spot where Joan of Arc went up in flames  --  he wonders if he will ever see the likes of her and their adventure again . Helen Baird appears some years later , when I am in the final stretch of graduate studies in comparative literature and feeling triumphant about the determination I have mustered to complete the job . Out of boredom , restlessness , impatience , and a growing embarrassment that nagginglyinforms me I am too old to be sitting at a desk still being tested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program just about every semester along the way . But now , with the end in sight , I utter my praises aloud while showering at the end of the day , thrilling myself with simple statements like " I did it " and " I stuck it out , " as though it is the Matterhorn I have had to climb in order to qualify for my orals . Following the year with Birgitta , I have come to realize that in order to achieve anythinglasting , I am going to have to restrain a side of myselfstrongly susceptible to the most bewildering and debilitatingsort of temptations , temptations that as long ago as that night outside Rouen I already recognized as inimi/cal to my overall interests . For , far as I had gone with Birgitta , I knew how very easy it would have been for me to have gone further still  --  more than once , I remember the thrill it had given me imagining her with men other than myself , imagining her taking money to bring home in her pocket . . . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually have become Birgitta 's pimp ? Well , whatevermy talent may have been for that profession , graduateschool has not exactly encouraged its development . . . Yes , when the battle appears to have been won , I am truly relieved by my ability to harness my good sense in behalf of a serious vocation  --  and not a little touched by my virtue . Then Helen appears to tell me , by example and in so many words , that I am sadly deluded and mistaken . Is it so as never to forget the charge that I marry her ? Hers is a different brand of heroism from what , at that time , I take mine to be  --  indeed , it strikes me as its antithesis . A year of U.S.C. at eighteen , and then she had run off with a journalist twice her age to Hong Kong , where he was already living with a wife and three children . Armed with startling good looks , a brave front , and a strongly romantic temperament , she had walked away from her homework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a word of apology or explanation to her stunned and mortified family ( who thought for a week she had been kidnapped or killed ) , taken off after a destiny more exhilarating than sophomore year in the sorority house . A destiny that she had found  --  and only recently abandoned . Just six months earlier , I learn , she had given up everyone and everything that she had gone in search ofp53eight years before  --  all the pleasure and excitement of roaming among the antiquities and imbibing the exotica of gorgeous places alluringly unknown  --  to come back to California and begin life anew . " I hope I never again have to live through a year like this last one " is nearly the first thing she says to me the night we meet at a party given by the wealthy young sponsors of a new San Franciscomagazine " of the arts . " I find Helen ready to tell her story without a trace of shyness ; but then I had not been shy myself , once we 'd been introduced , about meandering away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down through the hundreds of people milling around in the town house . " Why ? " I ask her  --  the first of the whys and whens and hows she will be obliged to answer for me  --  " What 's the year been like for you ? What went wrong ? " " Well , for one thing , I have n't been anywhere for six months at a stretch since I did my time as a coed . " " Why did you come back , then ? " " Men . Love . It all got out of hand . " Instantly I am ready to attribute her " candor " to a popular-magazine mentality  --  and a predilectionfor promiscuity , pure and simple . Oh , God , I think , so beautiful , and so corny . It seems from the stories she goes on to tell me that she has been in fifty passionate affairs already  --  aboard fifty schooners already , sailing the China Sea with men who ply her with antique jewelry and are married to somebody else . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have sized up such an existence , " what do you have against passion anyway ? Why the studied detachment , Mr. Kepesh ? You want to know who I am  --  well , I 'm telling you . " " It 's quite a saga , " I say . She asks , with a smile , " Why should n't it be ? Better a saga ' than a lot of other things I can think of . Comep54now , what do you have against passion anyway ? What harm has it ever done you ? Or should I ask , what good ? " " The question right now is what it has or has n't done for you . " " Fine things . Wonderful things . God knows , nothing I 'm ashamed of . " " Then why are you here and not there , being impassioned ? " " Because , " Helen answers , and without any irony at all for protection  --  which may be what makes me begin to surrender some of my own , and to see that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with me , and maybe even mine if I should want her  --  " Because , " she tells me , " I 'm getting on . " At twenty-six , getting on . Whereas the twenty-fouryear-oldPh.D. candidate who is my date for the evening  --  and who eventually leaves the party in a huff , without me  --  had been saying on the way over that , sorting her index cards in the library just that afternoon , she had been wondering if and when her life would ever get underway . I ask Helen what it was like to come back . We have left the party by now and are across from one another in a nearby bar . Less passively than I , she has given the slip to the companion with whom she started the evening . If I want her . . . but do I ? Should I ? Let me hear first what it had been like coming back from running away . For me , of course , there had been far more relief than letdown , and I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed an armistice with my poor mother , and my kid sisters followed me around like a movie star . The rest of the family gaped . Nice Republican girls did n't do what I did . Except that seems to be all I ever met everywhere I went , from Nepal to Singapore . There 's a small army of us out there , you know . I 'd say half the girls who fly out of Rangoonp55on that crate that goes to Mandalay are generally from Shaker Heights . " " And now what do you do ? " " Well , first I have to figure out some way to stop crying . I cried every day I was back for the first few months . Now that seems to be over , but , frankly , from the way I feel when I wake up in the morning I might as well be in tears . It 's that it was all so beautiful . Living in all that loveliness  --  it was overwhelming . I never stopped being thrilled . I got to Angkor every single spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chiengmai with a prince who owned elephants . You should have seen him with all his elephants . A nut-colored little old man moving like a spider in a herd of the most enormous animals . You could have wrapped him twice around in one of their ears . They were all screaming at one another , but he just walked along , unfazed . You probably think seeing that is , well , seeing only that . Well , that is n't what I thought . I thought , This is what it is . ' I used to go down in the sailboat  --  thisis in Hong Kong  --  to get my friend from work at the end of the day . He sailed with the boat boy to work in the morning and then at night we sailed home together , right down between the junks and the U.S. destroyers . " " The good colonial life . It is n't for nothing they hate giving up those empires . But I still do n't understand precisely why you gave up yours . " And in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe  --  despite the tiny ivory Buddhas , the jade carvings , and the row of rooster-shaped opium weights that are arranged by her bedside table  --  that this way of life ever really was hers . Chiengmai , Rangoon , Singapore , Mandalay . . . why not Jupiter , why not Mars ? To be sure , I know these places exist beyond the Rand McNallyp56map on which I trace the course of her adventures ( as once I traced down an adventure of Birgitta 's in the Londonphone directory ) , and the novels of Conrad where I first encountered them  --  and so , of course , do I know that " characters " live and breathe who choose to make their destiny in the stranger cities of the world . . . What then fails to persuade me completely that living , breathing Helen is one of them ? My being with her ? Is the unbelievable character Helen in her diamond-stud earrings or is it the dutiful graduate teaching assistant in his wash-and-dry seersucker suit ? I even become somewhat suspicious and critical of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard in which she seems to hold her eyes , her nose , her throat , her breasts , her hips , her legs  --  why , even her feet would seem to her to have charming little glories to be extolled . How does she come by this regal bearing anyway , this aristocraticsense of herself that seems to derive almost entirelyfrom the smoothness of skin , the length of limb , the breadth of mouth and span of eyes , and the fluting at the very tip of what she describes , without batting an eyelid ( shadowed in the subtlest green ) , as her " Flemish " nose ? I am not at all accustomed to someone who bears her beauty with such a sense of attainment and self-worth . My experience  --  running from the Syracuse undergraduateswho did not want to " relate " to me " on that level , " to Birgitta Svanstrom , for whom flesh was very much there to be investigated for every last thrill  --  has been of young women who make no great fuss about their looks , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do . True , Birgitta knew well enough that her hair cut short and carelessly nicely enhanced her charming fur/tiveness , but otherwise how she framed her unpainted face was not a subject to which she appeared to give much thought from one morning to the next . And Elisabeth , with an abundance of hair no less praiseworthy than Helen 's , simply brushed it straight down her back , letting it hang there as it had since she was six . To Helen , however , all that marvelous hair  --  closest in shading to the Irish setter  --  seems to be in the nature of a crown , or a spire , or a halo , there not simply to adorn or embellish but to express , to symbolize . Perhaps it is only a measure of how narrow and cloistered my life has become  --  or perhaps it is in fact the true measure of a courtesanlike power that emanates from Helen 's sense of herself as an idolized object that might just as well have been carved of one hundred pounds of jade  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of her head , and draws a black line above her lashes  --  above eyes in themselves no larger and no bluer than Elisabeth 's  --  when she dons a dozen bracelets and ties a fringed silk scarf around her hips like Carmen to go out to buy some oranges for breakfast , the effect is not lost upon me . Far from it . I have from the start been overcome by physical beauty in women , but by Helen I am not just intrigued and aroused , I am also alarmed , and made deeply , deeply uncertain  --  utterly subjugated by the authority with which she claims and confirms and makes singular her loveliness , yet as suspicious as I can be of the prerogatives , of the place , thereby bestowed upon her in her own imagination . Hers seems to me sometimes such a banalized conception of self and experience , and yet , all the same , enthralling and full of fascination . For all I know , maybe she is right . " How come , " I ask  --  still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction in this fabulous character she calls herself and in the Asiatic romance she claims for a past  --  " how come you gave up the good colonial life , Helen ? " " I had to . " " Because the inheritance money had made you independent ? " " It 's six thousand lousy dollars a year , David . Why , I believe even ascetic college teachers make that much . " " I only meant that you might have decided youth and beauty were n't going to get you through indefinitely . " " Look , I was a kid , and school meant nothing to me , and my family was just like everyone else 's  --  sweet and boring and proper , and living lo these many years under a sheet of ice at 18 Fern Hill Manor Road . The only excitement came at mealtime . Every night when we got to dessert my father said , Is that it ? ' and my mother burst into tears . And so at the age of eighteenI met a grown man , and he was marvelous-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could teach me plenty , and he knew what I was all about , which nobody else seemed to know at all , and he had wonderful elegant ways , and was n't really a brutal tyrant , as tyrants go ; and I fell in love with him  --  yes , in two weeks ; it happens and not just to schoolgirls , either  --  and he said , Why do n't you come back with me ? ' and I said yes  --  and I went . " " In a crate ' ? " " Not that time . Pate over the Pacific and fellatio in the first-class john . Let me tell you , the first six months were n't a picnic . I 'm not in mourning over that . You see , I was just a nicely brought-up kid from Pasadena , that 's all , really , in her tartan skirt and her loafers  --  my friend 's children were nearly as old as I was . Oh , splendidly neurotic , but practically my age . I could n't even learn to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , my first big opium party , I somehowp59wound up in a limousine with four of the wildest pansies  --  four Englishmen , dressed in gowns and gold slippers . I could n't stop laughing . It 's surreal , ' I kept saying , it 's surreal , ' until the plumpest of them looked down his lorgnette at me and said , Of course it 's surreal , dear , you 're nineteen . ' " " But you came back . Why ? " " I ca n't go into that . " " Who was the man ? " " Oh , you are becoming a cum laude student of real life , David . " " Wrong . Learned it all at Tolstoy 's feet . " I give her Anna Karenina to read . She says , " Not bad  --  only it was n't a Vronsky , thank God . Vronskys are a dime a dozen , friend , and bore you to tears . It was a man  --  very much a Karenin , in fact . Though not at all pathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment : what an original way to see the famous triangle ! " Another husband , " I say . " Only the half of it . " " Sounds mysterious ; sounds like high drama . Maybe you ought to write it all down . " " And perhaps you ought to lay off reading what all has been written down . " " And do what instead with my spare time ? " " Dip a foot back into the stuff itself . " " And there 's a book about that , you know . Called The Ambassadors . " I think : And there 's also a book about you . It 's called The Sun Also Rises and her name is Brett and she 's about as shallow . So is her whole crew  --  so , it seems , was yours . " I 'll bet there 's a book about it , " says Helen , gladly rising , with her confident smile , to the bait . " I 'll bet there are thousands of books about it . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library . Look , so there is no confusion , let me only mildly overstatethe case : I hate libraries , I hate books , and I hate schools . As I remember , they tend to turn everything about life into something slightly other than it isp60slightly ' at best . It 's those poor innocent theoretical bookwormswho do the teaching who turn it all into something worse . Something ghastly , when you think about it . " " What do you see in me , then ? " " Oh , you really hate them a little too . For what they 've done to you . " " Which is ? " " Turned you into something  --  " " Ghastly ? " I say , laughing ( for we are having this little duel beneath a sheet in the bed beside the little bronze opium weights ) . " No , not quite . Into something slightly other , slightly .. . wrong . Everything about you is just a little bit of a lie  --  except your eyes . They 're still you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like trying to put your hand into a bowl of hot water to pull out the plug . " " You put things vividly . You 're a vivid creature . I 've noticed your eyes too . " " You 're misusing yourself , David . You 're hopelessly intent on being what you 're not . I get the sense that you may be riding for a very bad fall . Your first mistake was to give up that spunky Swede with the knapsack . She sounds a little like a guttersnipe , and  --  I have to say it  --  from the snapshot looks to me a little squirrely around the mouth , but at least she was fun to be with . But of course that 's a word you just despise , correct ? Like crate ' for beat-up airplane . Every time I say fun ' I see you positively wincing with pain . God , they 've really done a job on you . You 're so damn smug , and yet I think secretly you know you lost your nerve . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't romanticize my nerve ' either  --  okay ? I like to have a good time now and then . I have a good time sleeping with you by the way . " " By the way , you have more than a good time sleeping with me . You have the best time you 've ever had with anybody . And , dear friend , " she adds , " do n't simplify me either . "  | " Oh , God , " says Helen , stretching languorously when morning comes , " fucking is such a lovely thing to do . " True , true , true , true , true . The passion is frenzied , inexhaustible , and in my experience , singularly replenishing . Looking back to Birgitta , it seems to me , from my new vantage point , that we were , among other things , helping each other at age twenty-two to turn into something faintly corrupt , each the other 's slave and slaveholder , each the arsonist and the inflamed . Exercisingsuch strong sexual power over each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly hypnotic atmosphere , but one which permeated the inexperienced mind first of all : I was intrigued and exhilarated at least as much by the idea of what we were engaged in as by the sensations , what I felt and what I saw . Not so with Helen . To be sure , I must first accustom myself to what strikes me at the height of my skepticism as so much theatrical display ; but soon , as understanding grows , as familiarity grows , and feeling with it , I begin at last to relinquish some of my suspiciousness , to lay off a little with my interrogations , and to see these passionate performancesas arising out of the very fearlessness that so draws me to her , out of that determined abandon with which she will give herself to whatever strongly beckons , and regardless of how likely it is to bring in the end as much pain as pleasure . I have been dead wrong , I tell myself , trying to dismiss hers as a corny and banalized mentality deriving from Screen Romance  --  rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fantasy , so total is her concentration , and the ingenuity with which she sounds her desire . Now , in the aftermath of orgasm , I find myself weak with gratitude and the profoundest feelingsp62of self-surrender . I am the least guarded , if not the simplest , organism on earth . I do n't even know what to say at such moments . Helen does , however . Yes , there are the things that this girl knows and knows and knows . " I love you , " she tells me . Well , if something has to be said , what makes more sense ? So we begin to tell each other that we are lovers who are in love , even while my conviction that we are on widely divergent paths is revived from one conversation to the next . Convinced as I would like to be that a kinship , rare and valuable , underlies and nourishes our passionate rapport , I still can not wish away the grand uneasiness Helen continues to arouse . Why else ca n't we stop  --  ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees to tell me why she gave up all she 'd had in the Far East : tells me either to address my suspiciousnessdirectly or to enrich the mystique I can not seem to resist . Her lover , the last of her Karenins , had begun to talk about arranging for his wife to be killed in an " accident . " " Who was he ? " " A very well-known and important man " is all she is willing to say . I swallow that as best I can and ask : " Where is he now ? " " Still there . " " Has n't he tried to see you ? " " He came here for a week . " " And did you sleep with him ? " " Of course I slept with him . How could I resist sleeping with him ? But in the end I sent him back . It nearly did me in . It was hideous , seeing him go for good . " " Well , maybe he 'll go ahead and have his wife killed anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fun of him ? Is it so impossible for you to understand that he 's as human as you ? " " Helen , there are ways of dealing with a mate you want to be rid of , short of homicide . Youp63just walk out the door , for one thing . " " Can you , just ' ? k that the way they do it in the Comparative Literature Department ? I wonder what it will be like , " she says , when you ca n't have something you want . " " Will I blow somebody 's brains out to get it ? Will I push somebody down the elevator shaft ? What do you think ? " " Look , I 'm the one who gave up everything and nearly died of it  --  because I could n't bear to hear the idea even spoken . It terrifiedme to know that he could even have such a thought . Or maybe it was so excrutiatingly tempting that that 's why I went running . Because all I had to say was yes ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David , and he was serious . And do you know how easy it would have been to say what he wanted to hear ? It 's only a word , it takes just a split second : yes . " " Only maybe he asked because he was so sure you 'd say no . " " He could n't be sure . 1 was n't sure . " " But such a well-known and important man could certainly have gone ahead then and had the thing clone on his own , could he not  --  and without your knowing he was behind it ? Surely such a well-known and importantman has all kinds of means at his disposal to get a measly wife out of the way : limousines that crash , boats that sink , airplanes that explode in mid-air . Had he done it on his own to begin with , what you thought about it all would never even have come up . If he asked your opinion , maybe it was to hear no . " " Oh , this is interesting . Go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What he has : the wife and you . He gets to keep it all , and to cut a very grand figure into the bargain . That you ran , that the whole idea took on reality for you , had moral consequences for you  --  well , he probably had n't figured on getting that kind of rise out of a beautiful , adventurous , American runaway . "  | " Very clever , indeed . A plus , especially the part about moral consequences . ' All that 's wrong is that you have n't the faintest understanding of what there was between us . Just because he 's someone with power , you think he has no feelings . But there are men , you know , who have both . We met two times a week for two years . Sometimesmore  --  but never less . And it never changed . It was never anything but perfect . You do n't believe such things happen , do you ? Or even if they do , you do n't want to believethey matter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered more than anything . " " But so has coming back happened . So did sending him away happen . So did your terror happen and your revulsion . This guy 's machinationsare beside the point . It mattered to you , Helen , that your limit had been reached . " " Maybe I was mistaken and that was only so much sentimentality about myself . Or some childish kind of hope . Maybe I should have stayed , gone beyond my limit  --  and learned that it was n't beyond me at all . " " You could n't , " I say , " and you did n't . " And who , oh , who is being the sentimentalist now ? It appears then that the capacity for pain-filled renunciationjoined to the gift for sensual abandon is what makes her appeal inescapable . That we never entirely get along , that I am never entirely sure , that she somehow lacks depth , that her vanity is so enormous , well , all that is nothing  --  is n't it ?  --  beside the esteem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroine , who has risked and won and lost so much already , squarely facing up to appetite . And then there is the beauty itself . Is she not the single most desirable creature I have ever known ? With a woman so physically captivating , a woman whom I can not take my eyes from even if she is only drinkingp65her coffee or dialing the phone , surely with someone whose smallest bodily movement has such a powerful sensuous hold upon me , I need hardly worry ever again about imaginationtempting me to renewed adventures in the base and the bewildering . Is not Helen the enchantress whom I had already begun searching for in college , when Silky Walsh 's lower lip stirred me to pursue her from the universitycafeteria to the university gymnasium and on to the dormitory laundry room  --  that creature to me so beautiful that upon her , and her alone , I can focus all my yearning , all my adoration , all my curiosity , all my lust ? If not Helen , who then ? Who ever will intrigue me more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be intrigued . Only if we marry . . . well , the contentious side of the affair will simply dwindle away of itself , will it not , an ever-deepening intimacy , the assurance of permanence , dissolving whatever impulse remains , on either side , for smugness and self-defense ? Of course it would not be quite such a gamble if Helen were just a little more like this and a little less like that ; but , as I am quick to remind myself  --  imagining that I am taking the mature position  --  that is not how we are bestowed upon each other in the world this side of dreams . Besides , what I call her " vanity " and her " lack of depth " is just what makes her so interesting ! So then , I can only hope that mere differences of " opinion " ( which , I readily admit  --  if that will help  --  I am often the first to point up and to dramatize ) will come to be altogether beside the point of the passionate attachment that has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather evangelical dialogues . I can only hope that just as I have been mistaken about her motives before , I am wrong again when I sus/pect that what she secretly hopes to gain by marriage is an end to her love affair with that unpathetic Karenin in Hong Kong . I can only hope that it is in fact I whom she will marry and not the barrier I may seem to be against the past whose loss had very nearly killed her . I can only hope ( for I can never know ) that it is I with whom she goes to bed , and not with memories of the mouth and the hands and the member of that most perfect of all lovers , he who would murder his wife in order to make his mistresshis own . Doubting and hoping then , wanting and fearing ( anticipatingthe pleasantest sort of lively future one moment , the worst in the next ) , I marry Helen Baird  --  after , that is , nearly three full years devoted to **34;4109;TOOLONG . There are some , like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing over a piano singing " Amapola " to decide in a flash , " There  --  there is my wife , " and there are others who sigh , " Yes , it is she , " only after an interminable drama of vacillation that has led them to the ineluctable conclusion that they ought never to see the woman again . I marry Helen when the weight of experience required to reach the monumental decision to give her up for good turns out to be so enormousand so moving that I can not possibly imagine life without her . Only when I finally know for sure that this must end now , do I discover how deeply wed I already am by my thousand days of indecision , by all the scrutinizing appraisal of possibilities that has somehow made an affair of three years ' duration seem as dense with human event as a marriage half a century long .

Why , I wonder , ca n't the toast go in while the eggs are cooking , rather than before ? This way we can get to eat our bread warm rather than cold . " I do n't believe I am having this discussion , " she says . " Life is n't toast ! " she finally screams . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you sit down to eat toast , life is toast . And when you take out the garbage , life is garbage . You ca n't leave the garbage halfway down the stairs , Helen . It belongsin the can in the yard . Covered . " " I forgot it . " " How can you forget it when it 's already in your hand ? " " Perhaps , dear , because it 's garbage  --  and what difference does it make anyway ! " She forgets to affix her signature to the checks she writes and to stamp the letters shep69mails , while the letters I give her to mail for me and the household turn up with a certain regularity in the pockets of raincoats and slacks months after she has gone off to deposit them in the mailbox . " What do you think about between Here and There ? What makes you so forgetful , Helen ? Yearnings for old Mandalay ? Memories of the crate ' and the lagoons and the elephants , of the dawn coming up like thunder  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every inch of the way . " " But why is it you think you 've gone outside with the letter in your hand to begin with ? " " For some air , that 's why ! To see some sky ! To breathe ! " Soon enough , instead of pointing out her errors and oversights , or retracing her steps , or picking up the pieces , or restraining myself ( and then going off to curse her out behind the bathroom door ) , I make the toast , I make the eggs , I take out the garbage , I pay the bills , and I mail the letters . Even when she says , graciously ( trying , at her end , to bridge the awful gap ) , " I 'm going out shopping , want me to drop these  --  " experience , if not wisdom , directs me to say , " No  --  no , thanks . " The day she loses her wallet after making a withdrawal from the savings account , I take over the transactions at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the car 's front seat after going out in the morning to get the salmon steaks for dinner , I take over the marketing . The day she has the wool shirt that was to have been dry-cleaned laundered by mistake , I take over going to the cleaners . With the result that before a year is out I am occupied  --  and glad of it  --  some sixteen hours a day with teaching my classes and rewriting into a book my thesis on romantic disillusionment in thep70stories of Anton Chekhov ( a subject I 'd chosen before even meeting my wife ) , and Helen has taken increasingly to drink and to dope . Her days begin in jasmine-scented waters . With olive oil in her hair to make it glossy after washing , and her face anointed with vitamin creams , she reclines in the tub for twenty minutes each morning , eyes closed and the precious skull at rest against a small inflated pillow ; the woman moves only to rub gently with her pumice stone the rough skin on her feet . Three times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her midnight-blue silk kimono , embroidered with pink and red poppies and yellowbirds never seen on land or sea , she sits at the counter of our tiny kitchenette , her turbaned head tilted over a bowl of steaming water sprinkled with rosemary and camomileand elder flower . Then , steamed and painted and coiffed , she is ready to dress for her exercise class  --  and wherever else it is she goes while I am at school : a closefittingChinese dress of navy-blue silk , high at the collar and slit to the thigh ; the diamond-stud earrings ; bracelets of jade and of gold ; her jade ring ; her sandals ; her straw bag . When she returns later in the day  --  after Yoga , she decided to go into San Francisco " to look around " : she talks ( has talked for years ) of plans to open a Far East antique shop there  --  she is already a little high , and by dinnertime she is all smiles : mellow , blotto , wry . " Life is toast , " she observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops . " Life is leftovers . Life is leather soles and rubberheels . Life is carrying forward the balance into the new checkbook . Life is writing the correct amount to be paid out onto each of the stubs . And the correct day ,  |p71month  , and year . " " That is all true , " I say . " Ah , " she says , watching me as I go about setting the table , " if only his wife did n't forget what she puts in to broil and leave everything to burn ; if only his wife could remember that when David had dinner in Arcadia , his mother always set the fork on the left and the spoon on the right and never never both on the same side . Oh , if only his wife could bake and butter his potato the way Mamma did in the wintertime . " By the time we are into our thirties we have so exacerbatedour antipathies that each of us has been reduced to precisely what the other had been so leery of at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which Helen detests me with all her heart  --  " You 've actually done it , David  --  you are a full-fledged young fogy "  --  no less in evidence than her " utter mindlessness , " " idiotic wastefulness , " " adolescent dreaminess , " etc . Yet I can never leave her , nor she me , not , that is , until outright disaster makes it simply ludicrous to go on waiting for the miraculous conversion of the other . As much to our wondermentas to everyone else 's , we remain married nearly as long as we had been together as lovers , perhaps becauseof the opportunity this marriage now provides for each of us to assault head-on what each takes to be his demon ( and had seemed at first to be the other 's salvation ! ) . The months go by and we remain together , wondering if a child would somehow resolve this crazy deadlock . . . or an antique shop of her own for Helen . . . or a jewelry shop . . . or psychotherapy for us both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly " attractive " couple : well dressed , traveled , intelligent , worldly ( especially as young academic couples go ) ,  |p72a  combined income of twelve thousand dollars a year .. . and life is simply awful . What little spirit smolders on in me during the last months of the marriage is visible only in class ; otherwise , I am so affectless and withdrawn that a rumor among the junior faculty members has me " under sedation . " Ever since the approval of my dissertation I have been teaching , it along with the freshman course " Introduction to Fiction , " two sections of the sophomore survey in " general " literature . During the weeks near the end of the term when we study Chekhov 's stories , I find , while reading aloud to my students passages which I particularly want them to take note of , that each and every sentence seems to me to alludeto my own plight above all , as though by now every single syllable I think or utter must first trickle down through my troubles . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are irrepressible , li and so obviously inspired by longings for miraculous salvation  --  reentryinto lives I lost long ago , reincarnation as a being wholly unlike myself  --  that I am even somewhat grateful to be depressed and without anything like the will power to set even the mildest fantasy in motion . " I realized that when you love you must either , in your reasoning about that love , start from what is higher , more important than happiness or unhappiness , sin or virtue in their usual meaning , or you must not reason at all . " I ask my students what 's meant by these lines , and while they tell me , notice that in a far corner of the room the poised , soft-spoken girl who is my most intelligent , my prettiest  --  and my most bored and arrogant  --  student is finishing off a candy bar and a Coke for lunch . " Oh , do n't eat junk , " I say to her , silently , and see the two of us onp73the terrace of the Gritti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ocher facade of the perfect little palazzo where we have taken a shuttered room . . . we are having our midday meal , creamy pasta followed by tender bits of lemoned veal . . . and at the very table where Birgitta and I , arrogant , nervy youngsters not much older than these boys and girls , sat down to eat on the afternoon we pooled much of our wealth to celebrateour arrival in Byron 's Italy . . . Meanwhile , my other bright student is explaining what the landowner Alyohin means at the conclusion of " About Love " when he speaks of " what is higher . . . than happinessor unhappiness , sin or virtue in their usual meaning . " The boy says , " He regrets that he did n't yield to his feeling and run off with the woman he fell in love with . Now that she 's going away , he 's miserable for havingallowed conscience and scruples , and his own timidity , to forbid him confessing his love to her just because she is already married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withoutcomprehension , and the clever boy looks dismayed . " Am I wrong ? " he asks , turning scarlet . " No , no , " I say , but all the while I am thinking , " What are you doing , Miss Rodgers , dining on Peanut Chews ? We should be sipping white wine . . . " And then it occurs to me that , as an undergraduate at U.S.C. , Helen probably looked rather like my bored Miss Rodgers in the months before that older man  --  a man of about my age !  --  plucked her out of the classroom and into a life of romantic adven-tureLater in the hour , I look up from reading aloud out of " Lady with a Lapdog " directly into the innocent and uncorruptedgaze of the plump , earnest , tenderhearted Jew/ish girl from Beverly Hills who has sat in the front row all year long writing down everything I say . I read to the class the story 's final paragraph , in which the adulterous couple , shaken to find how deeply they love one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wife and she a husband . " " And it seemed to them that in only a few more minutes a solution would be found and a new , beautifullife would begin ; but both of them knew very well that the end was still a long , long way away and that the most complicated and difficult part was only just beginning . " I hear myself speaking of the moving transparency of the ending  --  no false mysteries , only the harsh facts directly stated . I speak of the amount of human history that Chekhov can incorporate in fifteen pages , of how ridicule and irony gradually give way , even within so short a space , to sorrow and pathos , of his feel for the disillusioningmoment and for those processes wherein actuality seemingly pounces upon even our most harmless illusions , not to mention the grand dreams of fulfillment and adventure . I speak of his pessimism about what he calls " this business of personal happiness , " and all the while I want to ask the chubby girl in the front row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become my daughter . I want to look after her and see that she is safe and happy . I want to pay for her clothes and her doctor bills and for her to come and put her arms around me when she is feeling lonely or sad . If only it were Helen and I who had raised her to be so sweet ! But how could we two raise anything ? And later that day , when I happen to run into her walkingtoward me on the campus , I feel impelled yet again to say to someone who is probably no more than ten orp75twelve years my junior that I want to adopt her , want her to forget her own parents , about whom I know nothing , and let me father and protect her . " Hi , Mr. Kepesh , " she says , with a little wave of the hand , and that affectionate gesture does it , apparently . I feel as though I am growing lighter and lighter , I sense an emotion coming my way that will pick me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where . Am I going to have my nervous collapse right here on the walk in front of the library ? I take one of her hands in mine  --  I am saying , through a throat clogged with feeling , " You 're a good girl , Kathie . " She ducks her head , her forehead colors . " Well , " she says , " I 'm glad somebody around here likes me . " " You 're a good girl , " I repeat , and release the soft hand I am holding and go home to see if childless Helen is sober enough to prepare dinner for two . About this time we are visited by an English investment banker named Donald Garland , the first of Helen 's Hong Kong friends ever to be invited to dine with us in our apartment . To be sure , she has on occasion made herself spectacularly beautiful so as to go into San Francisco to have lunch with somebody or other out of paradise lost , but never before have I seen her approach such a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , in the past there have been times when , having spent hours getting made up for the luncheon engagement , she would emerge from the bathroom in her drabbest robe , announcing herself unable to leave the house to see anyone . " I look hideous . " " You do n't at all . " " I do , " and with that she returns to bed for the day . Donald Garland , she tells me now , is " the kindest man " she has ever known . " I was taken to lunch at his house myp76first week in Hong Kong , and we were the best of friends from then on . We just adored each other . The center of the table was strewn with orchids he 'd picked from his garden  --  in my honor , he said  --  and the patio where we ate looked out over the crescent of Repulse Bay . I was eighteen years old . He must have been about fifty-five . My God . Donald is probably seventy ! I could never believe he was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so thrilled with everything . He lived with the most easygoingand good-natured American boy . Chips must have been about twenty-six or - seven then . On the phone this afternoon Donald told the most terrible news  --  one morningtwo months ago Chips died of an aneurysm at breakfast ; just keeled over dead . Donald took the body back to Wilmington , Delaware , and buried it , and then he could n't leave . He kept booking plane tickets and canceling . Now , finally , he 's on his way home . " Chips , Donald , Edgar , Brian , Colin . . . I have no response to make , no interrogations or cross-examination , nothing faintly resembling sympathy , curiosity , or interest . Or patience . I had long ago heard all I could stand about the doings of the wealthy Hong Kong circle of Englishhomosexuals who had " adored " her . I exhibit only a churlish sort of surprise to find that I am to be a party to this very special reunion . She shuts her eyes tightly , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive . " Do n't talk to me like that . Do n't take that terrible tone . He was my dearest friend . He saved my life a hundred times . " And why did you risk it a hundred times ? But the interrogatory accusation , and the terribletone that goes with it , I manage to squelch , for by now even I know that I am being diminished far more byp77my anger at everything she does and did than by those ways of hers I ought to have learned to disregard , or to have accepted with a certain grace , long , long ago . . . Only as the evening wears on , and Garland becomes increasinglyspirited in his reminiscences , do I wonder if she has invited him to the apartment so that I might learn at first hand just how very far from the apex she has fallen by insanely joining her fate to this fogy 's . Whether or not that is her intention , it is something like the result . In their company I am no easygoing , good-natured Chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crack of the whip and the swish of the cane . In a vain attempt to force this pious , sour , censorious little prig out of my skin , I try hard to believe that Helen is simplyshowing this man who has meant so much to her and been so kind to her , and who has himself just suffered a terrible blow , that all is well in her life , that she and her husband live comfortably and amicably , and that her protectorhas n't to worry about her any longer . Yes , Helen is only acting as would any devoted daughter who wished to spare a doting father some harsh truth . . . In short : simple as the explanation for Garland 's presence might have seemed to someone else , it is wholly beyond my grasp , as though now that living with Helen has ceased to make the least bit of sense , I can not discover the truth about anything . At seventy , delicate , small-boned Garland still does have a youthful sort of charm , and a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so fragile-looking it seems it could be cracked with the tap of a spoon , and his cheeks are the small , round , glazed cheeks of an alabaster Cupid . Above the open shirt a pale silk scarf is tied aroundp78his neck , almost completely hiding from view the throat whose creases are the only sign of his age . In that strangely youthful face all there is to speak of sorrow are the eyes , soft , brown , and awash with feeling even while his crisp accent refuses to betray the faintest hint of grief . " Poor Derek was killed , you know . " Helen did not know . She puts her hand to her mouth . " But how ? Derek , " she says , turning to me , " was an associate in Donald 's firm . A very silly man sometimes , very muddled and so on , but such a good heart , really  --  " My dead expression sends her quickly back to Garland . " Yes , " he says , " he was a very kind person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could talk and go on , but then you just had to tell him , Derek , that 's enough now , ' and he 'd shut up . Well , two Chinese boys thought that he had n't given them enough money , so they kicked him down a flight of stairs . Broke Derek 's neck . " " How terrible . How awful . Poor , poor man . And what , " asks Helen , " has happened to all his animals ? " " The birds are gone . Some sort of virus wiped them out the week after he was killed . The rest Madge adopted . Madge adopted them and Patricia looks after them . Otherwise , those two wo n't have anything to do with each other . " " Again ? " " Oh yes . She can be a good bitch , that Madge , when she wants to be . Chips did her house over for her a year ago . She nearly drove the poor boy crazy with her upstairs bath . " Helen tries yet again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains that Madge and Patricia , who own houses down along the bay from Donald , were stars of the British cinema in the forties . Donald rattles off the names of the movies they made . I nod and nod , just like an agreeable person , but the smile I make ap79stab at presenting him does not begin to come off . The look Helen has for me does , however , quite effectively . " And how does Madge look ? " Helen asks him . " Well , when she makes up , she still looks wonderful . She ought never to wear a bikini , of course . " I say , " Why ? " but no one seems to hear me . The evening ends with Garland , by now a little drunk , holding Helen 's hand and telling me about a famous masquerade party held in a jungle clearing on a small island in the Gulf of Siam owned by a Thai friend of his , half a mile out to sea from the southern finger of Thailand . Chips , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , like Prince Ivan in The Firebird . " She was ravishing . A silk Cossack shirt and full silk trousers gathered into soft silver kid boots , and a silver turban with a diamond clasp . And around her waist a jeweled belt of emeralds . " Emeralds ? Bought by whom ? Obviouslyby Karenin . Where 's the belt now , I wonder ? What do you have to return and what do you get to keep ? You certainly get to keep the memories , that 's for sure . " A little Thai princess burst into tears at the very sight of her . Poor little thing . She 'd come wearing everything but the kitchen stove and expected people to swoon . But the one who looked like royalty that night was this dear girl . Oh , it was quite a to-do . Has n't Helen ever shown you the photographs ? Do n't you have photographs , dear ? " " No , " she says , " not any more . " " Oh , I wish I 'd brought mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even know who I was when I left home . And remember the little boys ? " he says , after a long sip from his brandy glass . " Chips , of course , got all the little native boys stripped down , with just a little coconut shell around their how-dee-dos , and Christmastinsel streaming down around their necks . What ap80sight they were when the wind blew ! Well , the boat landed , and there were these little chaps to greet the guests and to lead us up a torch-lined path to the clearing where we had the banquet . Oh , my goodness , yes  --  Madge came in the dress that Derek wore for his fortieth birthday party . Never would spend money , if she could help it . Always angry about something , but mostly it 's the money everyone'sstealing from her . She said , You ca n't just go to one of these things , you have to have something wonderful to Wear . ' So I said to her , only as a joke , mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's white chiffon covered with Diamonte and with a long train . And cut very low in the back . You 'll look lovely in it , darling . ' And Madge said , How could it be cut low in the back , Donald ? How in the world could Derek have worn it ? What about the hair on his back , and all that disgusting rubbish ? ' And I said , Oh , darling , he only shaves once every three years . ' ' You see , " Garland says to me , " Derek was rather the old Guards officer type  --  slim , elegant , very pink-complexioned , altogether the most extraordinarily hairless person . Oh , there 's a photograph of Helen you must see , David . I must send it to you . It 's Helen being led from the boat by these enchanting little native boys streaming Christmas tinsel . With her long legs and all that silk clinging to her , oh , she was absolute perfection . And her face  --  her face in that photograph is classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it . She was the most ravishing thing . Patricia Said about Helen , the first moment she laid eyes on her  --  that was at lunch at my house , and the darling girl still had the most ordinary little clothes  --  but Patricia said then she had star quality , that without a doubt she could be a film star . And she could have been . She still has it.  |p81She  always will . " " I know , " replies the schoolmaster , silently swishing his cane . After he leaves , Helen says , " Well , there 's no need to ask what you thought of him , is there ? " " It 's as you said : he adores you . " " Really , just what has empowered you to sit in judgment of other people 's passions ? Have n't you heard ? It 's a wide , wide world ; room for everybody to do whatever he likes . Even you once did what you liked , David . Or so the legend goes . " " I sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , you would n't believe . " " Ah , yourself . Hardest on yourself . Momentarily I forgot . " " I sat , Helen , and I listened and I do n't remembersaying anything about the passions or preferencesor private parts of anybody from here to Nepal . " " Donald Garland is probably the kindest man alive . " " Fine with me . " " He was always there when I needed someone . There were weeks when I went to live in his house . He protected me from some terrible people . " Why did n't you just protect yourself by staying away from them ? " Good , " I say ; " you were lucky and that was great . " " He likes to gossip and to tell tales , and of course he got a little maudlin tonight  --  look what he 's just been through . But he happens to know what people are , just how much and just how little  --  and he is devoted to his friends , even the fools . The loyalty of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disparaged by anyone . And do n't you be misled . When he is feeling himself he can be like iron . He can be unmovable , and marvelous . " " I am sure he was a wonderful friend to you . " " He still is ! " " Look , what are you trying to tell me ? I do n't always get the gist of things these days . Rumor has it my students are going to give me the final exam , to see if they 've been able top82get anything through my skull . What are we talking about now ? " " About the fact that I am still a person of consequenceto quite a few people , even if to you and the learned professors and their peppy , dowdy little wives I am beneath contempt . It 's true I 'm not clever enough to bake banana bread and carrot bread and raise my own bean sprouts and audit ' seminars and head up ' committeesto outlaw war for all time , but people still look at me , David , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men who run the world ! I would n't have had to look far , either . I hate to have to say such a vulgar , trashy thing about myself , but it 's what you 're reduced to saying to someone who finds you repulsive . " " I do n't find you repulsive . I 'm still awestruck ' that you chose me over the president of ITT . How can someone unable even to finish a little pamphlet on Anton Chekhov feel anything but gratitude to be living with the runner-up for Queen of Tibet ? I 'm honored to have been chosen to be your hair shirt . " " It 's debatable who is the hair shirt around here . I am repugnant to you , Donald is repugnant to you  --  " " Helen , I neither liked the man nor disliked the man . I did my level fucking best . Look , my best friend as long ago as college was practically the only queer there . I had a queer for a friend in 1950  --  before they even existed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one . I do n't care who wears whose dress  --  oh , fuck it , forget it , I quit . " Then on a Saturday morning late in the spring , just as I have sat down at my desk to begin marking exams , I hear the front door of our apartment open and shut  --  and finally the dissolution of this hopeless misalliance has begun . Helen is gone . Several days pass  --  hideous days , involving two visits to the San Francisco morgue ,  |p83one  with Helen 's demure , bewildered mother , who insists on flying up from Pasadena and bravely coming along with me to look at the broken body of a drowned " Caucasian " woman , age thirty to thirty-five  --  before I learn her whereabouts . The first telephone call  --  informing me that my mate is in a Hong Kong jail  --  is from the State Department . The second call is from Garland , who adds certain lurid and clarifying details : she had gone from the Hong Kong airport directly by taxi to the well-known ex-lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am told , son and heir of the founder of the MacDonald-Metcalf Line , and king of the cargo routes from the Cape of Good Hope to Manila Bay . At Jimmy Metcalf 's home , she had not even been allowed past the servant posted at the door , not after her name had been announced to Metcalf 's wife . And when , some hours later , she left her hotel to tell the police of the plan made some years earlier by the president of MacDonald-Metcalf to have this wife run down by a car , the officer on duty at the police station made a telephone call and subsequently a packet of cocaine was found in her purse . " What happens now ? " I ask him . " My God , Donald , now what ? " " I get her out , " says Garland . " Can that be done ? " " It can . " " How ? " " How would you think ? " Money ? Blackmail ? Girls ? Boys ? I do n't know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever works , do it . " The question is , " says Garland , " what happens whenp84Helen is free ? I can , of course , make her quite comfortableright here . I can provide her with all she needs to pull herself together again , and to go on . I want to know what you think is for the best . She can not afford to be caught in between again . " " In between what ? Donald , this is all a little confusing . I have no idea what 's best , frankly . Tell me , please , why did n't she go to you when she got there ? " " Because she got it in her head to see Jimmy . She knew that if she 'd come first to me I would never have let her go anywhere near him . I know the man , better than she does . " " And you knew she was coming ? " " Yes , of course . " " The night you were here for dinner . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . But she was to have cabled . I would have been at the airport to meet her . But she did it Helen 's way . " " She should n't have , " I say dumbly . " The question is , does she come back to you or stay with me ? I 'd like you to tell me which you think is best . " " You 're sure she 's getting out of jail , you 're sure the charges will be dropped  --  " " I would n't have phoned to say what I 'm saying other-wise . " " What happens then . . . well , it 's up to Helen , is n't it ? That is , I 'd have to talk to her . " " But you ca n't . I 'm lucky I could . We 're lucky she is n't in irons already and halfway to Malaysia . Our police chief is not the most charitable of men , except on his own behalf . And your rival is not Albert Schweitzer . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , It 's so difficult to go shopping with Jimmy . If I see something I like , he buys me twelve . ' She used to say to him , But , Jimmy , I can only wear one at a time . ' But Jimmy never understood , Mr. Kepesh . He does everything by twelves . " " Okay , I believe that . " " I do n't want anything further to go wrong for Helen  --  ever , " says Garland . " I want to know exactly where Helen stands , and I want to know now . She has been through years of hell . She was a marvelous , dazzling creature , and life has treated her hideously . I wo n't allow either one of you to torture her again . " But I ca n't tell him where she stands  --  I do n't know where I stand . First , I say , I- must reach Helen 's family and calm their fears . He will hear from me . Will he ? Why ? As though I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club meeting after school , Helen 's mother says , politely , " And when will she be home ? " " I do n't know . " But this does not appear to faze the adventuress 's mother . " I do hope you 'll keep me informed , " she says , brightly . " I will . " " Well , thank you for calling , David . " What else can the mother of an adventuress do but thank people for calling and keeping her informed ? And what does the husband of an adventuress do while his wife is in jail in the Far East ? Well , at dinnertime I prepare an omelette , make it very carefully , at just the right heat , and serve it to myself with a little chopped parsley , a glass of wine , and a slice of buttered toast . Thenp86I take a long hot shower . He does n't want me to torture her ; all right , I wo n't torture her  --  but best of all , I wo n't torture myself . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do my night 's reading in bed , all by myself . No girls , not yet . That will come in its own sweet time . Everything will . Can it be ? I am back where I was six years ago , the night before I ditched my sensible date and took Hong Kong Helen home from that party . Except that now I have my job , I have my book to complete , and I seem to have this comfortable apartment , so charmingly and tastefully decorated , all to myself . What is Mauriac'sphrase ? " To revel in the pleasures of the unshared bed . " For some hours my happiness is complete . Have I ever heard or read of something like this happening , of a personbeing catapulted out of his misery directly into bliss ? The common wisdom has it that it works the other way around . Well , I am here to say that on rare occasions it seems to work this way too . My God , I do feel good . I will not torture her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two hundred and forty minutes of this , more or less . With a loan from Arthur Schonbrunn , a colleague who had been my thesis adviser , I buy a round-trip ticket and fly off to Asia the next day . ( At the bank I discover that the entire balance in our savings account had been withdrawnby Helen the week before , for her one-way air ticket , and to start her new life . ) On the plane there is time to think  --  and to think and to think and to think . It must be that I want her back , that I ca n't give her up , that I am in love with her whether I 've known it or not , that she is my destinyNot one word of this stuff convinces me .

Nor am I Acting Responsibly , or out of shame , or masochism , or vindictive glee . . . Then that leaves love . Love ! At this late date ! Love ! After all that 's been done to destroy it ! More love , suddenly , than there was anywhere along the way ! I spend the rest of my waking hours on that flight rememberingevery single charming , sweet , beguiling word she has ever spoken . Accompanied by Garland  --  grim , courteous , impeccablynow the banker and businessman  --  a Hong Kong police detective , and the clean-cut young man from the American consulate who is also there to meet my airplane , I am taken to a jail to see my wife . As we leave the terminal for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was to be out by now . " " The negotiations , " he says , " seem to involve more interests than we had imagined . " " Hong Kong , " the young consulate officer informs me wryly , " is the birthplace of collective bargaining . " Everybody in the car seems to know the score , except me . I am searched and then allowed to sit with her in a tiny room whose door is dramatically locked behind us . The sound of the lock catching makes her reach wildly for my hand . Her face is blotchy , her lips are blistered , her eyes . . . her eyes I can not look into without my innardsp88crumbling . And Helen smells . And as for all that I felt for her up in the air , well , I simply can not bring myself to love her like that down here on the ground . I have never loved her quite like that down on the ground before , and I 'm not going to start in a jail . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other kind of idiot . . . but that I will have to determine later . " They planted cocaine on me . " " I know . " " He ca n't get away with that , " she says . " He wo n't . Donald is going to get you out of here . " " He has to ! " " He is , he 's doing it . So you do n't have to worry . You 'll be out very soon now . " " I have to tell you something terrible . All our cash is gone . The police stole it . He told them what to do to me  --  and they did it . They laughed at me . They touched me . " " Helen , tell me the truth now . I have to know . We all have to know . When you get out of here , do you want to stay on with Donald in his house ? He says he will look after you , he  --  " " But I ca n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please ! Jimmy will kill me ! " On the return flight Helen drinks until the stewardess says she can not serve her another . " I 'll bet you were even faithful to me , " she says , oddly " chatty " suddenly . " Yes , I 'll bet you were , " she says , serene in a dopey sort of way now that the whiskey has somewhat dimmed the horrors of incarceration and she is beyond the nightmare of Jimmy Metcalf 's revenge . I do n't bother to answer one way or the other . Of the two meaningless copulations of the last year there is nothing to say ; she would only laugh if I were to tell her who her rivals had been . Nor could I expect much sympathy were I to try to explain to her how unsatisfying it had been to deceive her with women who had n't a hundredth of her appeal to me  --  who hadn'tp89a hundredth of her character , let alone her loveliness  --  and whose faces I could have spit into when I realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her place . Quickly enough  --  almost quickly enough  --  I had seen that deceiving a wife as disliked as Helen was by other women just was n't going to be possiblewithout humiliating myself in the process . I had n't a Jimmy Metcalf 's gift for coldly rearing back and deliveringthe grand and fatal blow to my opponent ; no , vengeancewas his style and contentious melancholia was mine . . . Helen 's speech is badly slurred by liquor and fatigue , but now that she has had a bath , and a meal , and a change of clothes , and a chance to make up her face , she intends to have a conversation , her first in days and days . She intends now to resume her place in the world , and not as the vanquished , but as herself . " Well , " she says , " you did n't have to be such a good boy , you know . You could have had your affairs , if that would have made you any happier . I could have taken it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's you , David , who would n't have survived in one piece . You see , I 've been faithful to you , whether you believe it or not . The only man I 've been faithful to in my life . " Do I believe that ? Can I ? And if I should ? Where does that leave me ? I say nothing . " You do n't know yet where I used to go sometimes after my exercise class . " " No , I do n't . " " You do n't know why I went out in the morning wearing my favorite dress . " " I had my ideas . " " Well , they were wrong . I had no lover . Never , never with you . Because it would have been too hideous . You could n't have taken it  --  and so I did n't do it . You would have been crushed , you would have forgiven me , and you would never have been yourself again . Youp90would have gone around bleeding forever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around bleeding . Where did you go all dressed up ? " " I went out to the airport . " " And ? " " And I sat in the Pan Am waiting room . I had my passport in my handbag . And my jewelry . I sat there reading the paper until somebody asked if I wanted to have a drink in the first-class lounge . " " And I 'll bet somebody always did . " " Always  --  that 's right . And I 'd go there and have a drink . We would talk . . . and then they would ask me to go away with them . To South America , to Africa , everywhere . A man even asked me to come with him on a business trip to Hong Kong . But I never did it . Never . Instead , I came back home and you started in on me about the checkbook stubs . " " You did this how often ? " " Often enough , " she replies . " Enough for what  --  to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you idiot , to see if you still had the power . " She begins to sob . " Will it startle you , " she asks , " to hear that I think we should have had that baby ? " " I would n't have risked it , not with you . " My words knock the wind out of her , what wind is left . " Oh , you shit , that was unnecessary , there are less cruel ways . . . " she says . " Oh , why did n't I let Jimmy kill her when he wanted to ! " she cries . " Quiet down , Helen . " " You should see her now  --  she stood there , ten feet inside the hallway , glaring out at me . You should see her  --  she looks like a whale ! That beautiful man goes to bed with a whale . " " I said quiet down . " " He told them to plant cocaine on me  --  on me , the person he loves ! He let them take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved that man ! I only left him to save him from committing a murder ! And now he hates me for being too decent , and you despise me for being indecent , and the truth of it is thatp91I 'm better and stronger and braver than both of you . At least I was  --  and I was when I was only twenty years old ! You would n't risk a baby with me ? What about someone like you ? Did it ever occur to you that about a baby it may have been the other way around ? No ? Yes ? Answer me ! Oh , I ca n't wait to see the little sparrow you do take the risk with . If only you had taken it into your hands long ago , years ago  --  at the beginning ! I should have had nothing to say about it ! " " Helen , you 're exhausted and you 're loaded and you do n't know what you 're saying . A lot you cared about having a baby . " " A lot I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did I come on this airplane with you ! I could have stayed with Donald ! He needs someone as much as I do . I should have stayed with him in his house , and told you to go on home . Oh , why did I lose my nerve in that jail ! " " You lost it because of your Jimmy . You thought when you got out he 'd kill you . " " But he would n't  --  that was crazy ! He only did what he did because he loves me so , and I loved him ! Oh , I waited and I waited and I waited  --  I 've waited for you for six years ! Why did n't you take me into your world like a man ! " " Maybe you mean why did n't I take you out of yours . I could n't . The only kind to take you out is the kind who took you in . Sure , I know about my terrible tone , and the scornful looks I can give , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . Next time you want to be saved from a tyrant , find another tyrant to do the job . I admit defeat . " " Oh , God , oh , Jesus God , why must they be either brutes or choirboys ? Stewardess , " she says , grabbingthe girl 's arm as she passes in the aisle , " I do n't want a drink , I 've had enough . I only want to ask a question of you . Do n't be frightened . Why are they either brutes orp92choirboys , do you know ? " " Who , madam ? " " Do n't you find that in your travels from one continent to the other ? They 're even afraid , you know , of a sweet little thing like you . That 's why you have to go around grinning like that . Just look the bastards right in the eye and they 're either at your knees or at your throat . " When at last Helen has fallen asleep  --  her face rolling familiarly on my shoulder  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin where I had had to leave off a hundred or so hours ago . Yes , I have taken my schoolworkwith me  --  and a good thing too . I can not imagine how I could get through the million remaining hours of the flight without these examination papers to hang on to . " Without this . . . " and see myself strangling Helen with the coil of her waist-long hair . Who strangles his lover with her hair ? Is n't it somebody somewhere in Browning ? Oh , who cares ! " The search for intimacy , not because it necessarily makes for happiness , but because it is necessary , is one of Chekhov 's recurrent themes . " The paper I have chosen to begin with  --  to begin again with  --  is by Kathie Steiner , the girl I had dreamed of adopting . " Good , " I write in the margin alongside her opening sentence ; then I reread it and after " necessary " make an insertion mark and write , " for survival ( ? ) . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below are the beaches of Polynesia . Well , dear , dazzling creature , a lot of good that does us ! Hong Kong ! The whole damn thing could have taken place in Cincinnati ! A hotel room , a police station , an airport . A vengeful megalomaniac and some crooked cops ! And a would-be Cleopatra ! Our savingsgone on this trashy Grade-B thriller ! Oh , this voyagep93is the marriage itself  --  traversing four thousand miles of the exotic globe twice over , and for no good reason at all ! " Struggling to fix my attention once again on the task at hand  --  and not on whether Helen and I should have had a child , or who is to blame because we did n't ; refusing to charge myself yet again with all I could have done that I did n't do , and all I did that I should n't have  --  I return to Kathie Steiner 's final exam . Jimmy Metcalf instructs the police : " Kick her ass a little , gentlemen , it 'll do the whore some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of Kathie 's pages , correcting every last comma fault , reminding her about her dangling-modifier problem , and dutifully filling the margin with my commentaryand questions . Me and my " finals " ; my marking pen and my paper clips . How the Emperor Metcalf would enjoy the spectacle  --  likewise Donald Garland and his uncharitable chief of police . I suppose I ought to laugh a little myself ; but as I am a literature professor and not a policeman , as I am someone who long ago squeezed out what little of the tyrant was ever in him  --  from the look of things , maybe squeezed out just a bit too much  --  instead of laughing it all off , I come to Kathie 's concluding sentence , and am undone . The hold I have had on myself since Helen 's disappearance dissolves like that , and I must turn my face and press it into the darkened window of the humming airship that is carrying us back home to complete , in orderly and legal fashion , the disentanglementof our two wrecked lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finally I seem to cry hardest of all with the realization that somehow not every last thing has been destroyed , that despite my consuming obsessionwith my marital unhappiness and my dreamyp94desire to call out to my young students for their help , I have somehow gotten a sweet , chubby , unharmed and as yet unhorrified daughter of Beverly Hills to end her sophomoreyear of college by composing this grim and beautiful lament summarizing what she calls " Anton Chekhov 's overall philosophy of life . " But can Professor Kepesh have taught her this ? How ? How ? I am only just beginning to learn it on this flight ! " We are born innocent , " the girl has written , " we suffer terrible disillusionment before we can gain knowledge , and then we fear death  --  and we are granted only fragmentary happiness to offset the pain . "  |p95am  finally extracted from the rubble of my divorce by a job offer from Arthur Schonbrunn , who has left Stanfordto become chairman of the comparative literature program at the State University of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyst in San Francisco  --  only shortly after I began seeing the lawyer  --  and it is he who recommends that when I return East to teach I continue therapy with a Dr. Frederick Klinger , whom he knows and can recommend as someone who is not afraid to speak up with his patients , " a solid , reasonable man , " as he is described to me , " a specialist , " I am told , " in common sense . " But are reason and common sense what I need ? Some would say that I have ruined things by far too narrow a devotion to exactlythese attributes . Frederick Klinger is solid , all right : a hearty , roundfacedfellow , full of life , who , with my permission , smokes cigars throughout the sessions . I do n't much like the aroma myself , but allow it because smoking seems even further to concentrate the keenness with which Klingerp96attends to my despair . Not many years older than me , and sporting fewer gray hairs than I have lately begun to show , he exudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle years . I gather from the phone calls which , to my distress , he takes during my hour , that he is already a key figure in psychoanalytic circles , a member of the governing bodies of schools , publications , and research institutes , not to mention the last source of hope for any number of souls in disrepair . At first I find myself somewhat put off by the sheer relish with which the doctor seems to devour his responsibilities  --  put off , to be truthful , by nearly everything about him : the double-breasted chalk-stripe suit and the floppy bow tie , the frayed Chesterfield coat growing tight over the plumpening middle , the two bursting briefcases at the coat rack , the photos of the smiling healthy children on the book-laden desk , the tennis racket in the umbrella stand  --  put off even by the gym bag pushed behind the big worn Eames chair from which , cigar in hand , he addresses himself to my confusion . Can this snazzy , energeticconquistador possibly understand that there are mornings when on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent myself from dropping down and curling up on the living-room floor ? I do n't entirelyunderstand the depth of this plunge myself . Havingfailed at being a husband to Helen  --  having failed at figuring out how to make Helen a wife  --  it seems I would rather sleep through my life now than live it . How , for instance , have I come to be on such terrible terms with sensuality ? " You , " he replies , " who married a femme fatale ? " " But only to de-fatalize her , to de-fang her , along the way . All that nagging at her , at Helen ,  |p97about  the garbage and the laundry and the toast . My mother could n't have done a better job . About every last detail ! " " Too divine for details , was she ? Look , she is n't the Helen born of Leda and Zeus , you know . She 's of the earth , Mr. Kepesh  --  a middle-class Gentile girl from Pasadena , California , pretty enough to get herself a free trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , in the way of supernatural achievement . And cold toast is cold toast , no matter how much jewelry the cook may have accumulated over the years from rich married men with a taste for young girls . " " I was frightened of her . " " Sure you were . " His phone rings . No , he can not possibly be at the hospitalbefore noon . Yes , he has seen the husband . No , the gentleman does not seem willing to cooperate . Yes , that is most unfortunate . Now back to this uncooperative gentleman . " Sure you were frightened , " he says , " you could n't trust her . " " I would n't trust her . And she was faithful to me . I believe that . " " Neither here nor there . Some game she was playing with herself , that 's all . What value did it have when the fact is that the two of you had no real business together ever ? From the sound of it the only thing each of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I was frightened of Birgitta , too . " " My God , " he exclaims , " who would n't have been ? " " Look , either I 'm not making myself clear or you do n't even want to begin to understand me . I 'm saying that these were special creatures , full of daring and curiosity  --  and freedom . They were not ordinary young women . " " Oh , I understand that . " " Do you ? I think sometimes that you 'd prefer to assign them both to some very tawdry category of humankind . But what made them special is that they were n't tawdry , not to me , neither one of them.  |p98They  were exceptional . " " Granted . " The phone rings . Yes , what is it ? I am in session , yes . No , no , go ahead . Yes . Yes . Of course he understands . No , no , he 's pretending , pay no attention . All right , increase the dosage to four a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues crying . Call me anyway . Goodbye . " Granted , " he says , " but what were you supposed to do , having married one of these special creatures ' ? Spend days as well as nights fondling her perfect breasts ? Join her opium den ? The other day you said the only thing you learned from six years with Helen was how to roll a joint . " " I think saying that is what is known as courting the analyst 's favor . I learned plenty . " " The fact remains  --  you had your work to do . " " The work is just a habit , " I say , without disguising my irritation with his dogged " demythologizing . " " Perhaps , " I wearily suggest , " reading books is the opiate of the educatedclasses . " " Is it ? Are you thinking of becoming a flower child ? " he says , lighting up a new cigar . " Once Helen and I were sunbathing in the nude on a beach in Oregon . We were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted a guy watching us from off in some brush . We started to cover up , but he came toward us anyway and asked if we were nudists . When I said no he gave us a copy of his nudist newspaper in case we wanted to subscribe . " Klinger laughs loudly . " Helen said to me that God Himself must have sent him because it had been , by that time , fully ninety minutes since I 'd read anything . " Again Klinger laughs with genuine amusement . " Look , " I tell him , " you just do n't know what it was like when I first met her . It 's not to be so easily disparaged . You do n't know what I was like , nor can you  --  nor can I , any more  --  seeing me in this shape.  |p99But  I was a fearless sort of boy back in my early twenties . More daring than most , especially for that woebegone era in the history of pleasure . I actually did what the jerk-off artists dreamed about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , I was , if I may say so , something of a sexual prodigy . " " And you want to be one again , in your thirties ? " I do n't even bother to answer , so narrow and wrongheaded does the common sense he 's mastered strike me . " Why allow Helen , " Klinger continues , " who has disfigured herself so in the frantic effort to be the high priestess of Eros  --  who very nearly destroyedyou with her pronouncements and insinuations  --  why allow her judgment power over you still ? How long do you intend to let her go on rebuking you where you feel weakest ? How long do you intend to go on feeling weak over such utter foolishness ? What was this daring ' search of hers  --  ? " The telephone . " Excuse me , " he says . Yes , this is he . Yes , go ahead . Hello  --  yes , I can hear you very well . How is Madrid ? What ? Well , of course he 's suspicious , what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is behaving stupidly and then forget it . No , of course you do n't want to get into a fight . I understand . Just say it , and then try to have some courage . You can stand up to him . Go back up to the room and tell him . Come on now , you know very well you can . All right . Good luck . Have a good time . I said , then go out and have a good time . Goodbye . " What was this search of hers , " he says , " but so much evasion , a childish flight from the real attainable projects of a life ? " " Then , on the other hand , " I say , " maybe the projects ' are so much evasionof the search . " " Please , you like to read and write about books . That , by your own testimony , gives youp100enormous satisfaction  --  did , at any rate , and will again , I assure you . Right now you 're fed up with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from what I gather you are not uninspired at it . I still do n't know what alternative you have in mind . You want to move to the South Seas and teach great books to the girls in sarongs at the University of Tahiti ? You want to have a go at a harem again ? To be a fearless prodigy again , playing at Jack and Jill with your little Swedish daredevil in the working-class bars of Paris ? You want a hammer over your head again  --  though maybe this time one that finds the mark ? " " Burlesquing what I 'm talking about does n't do me any good , you know . It 's obviously not goingback to Birgitta that 's on my mind . It 's going ahead . I ca n't go ahead . " " Perhaps going ahead , on that road anyway , is a delusion . " " Dr. Klinger , I assure you that I am sufficiently imbued by now with the Chekhovian bias to suspect as much myself . I know what there is to know from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libidinous fallacy . I too have read and studied the great Western wisdom on the subject . I have even taught it . I have even practiced it . But , if I may , as Chekhov also had the ordinary good sense to write : in psychological matters , God preserve us from generalizations . ' " " Thank you for the literature lesson . Tell me this , Mr. Kepesh : can you really be in the doldrums about what has befallen her  --  over what you seem to think you have done ' to her  --  or are you just trying to prove to us that you are a man of feeling and conscience ? If so , do n't overdo it . Because this Helen was bound to spend a night in jail , sooner or later . Destined for it long before she met you . From the sound of it , it 's how shep101landed on you  --  in the hope of being saved from the hoosegow , and the other inevitable humiliations . And that you know , as well as I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , burlesque , or even try a smidgen of charm in order to get me to put the marriage and divorce behind me , I am , whether he believes it or not , never altogether immune from selfrecriminationwhen stories reach me of the ailments that are said to be transforming the one-time Occidentalprincess of the Orient into a bitter hag . I learn of a debilitating case of rhinitis that can not seem to be checked by drugs and necessitates that she live with a tissue continuously rubbing away at her nose  --  at the fluted nostrils that flare as though catching the wind when she achieves her pleasure . I hear tell of extensive skin eruptions , on the cunning fingers ( " You like this ? . . . this ? . . . oh , you do like it , my darling ! " ) , and on her wide , lovely lips ( " What do you see first in a face ? The eyes or the mouth ? I like that you discovered my mouth first " ) . But then Helen 's is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance , or losing heart , or removing itselffrom the fray . Eating hardly anything , I have dropped since the divorce to scarecrow weight , and for the second time in my life I am bereft of my potency , even for an entertainment as unambitious as self-love . " I should never have come home from Europe , " I tell Klinger , who has at my request put me on an anti-depressant drug , which pries me out of bed in the morning but then leaves me for the rest of the day with vague , otherworldlyfeelings of encapsulation , of vast unpassable reaches between myself and the flourishing hordes . " I should have One all the way and become Birgitta 's pimp.  |p102I  'd be a happier , healthier member of society . Somebody else could teach the great masterworks of disillusionment and renunciation . " " Yes ? You would rather be a pimp than an associate professor ? " " That 's one way of putting it . " " Put it your own way . " " This something in me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessness , " before I even understood it , or let it have a life . . . I throttled it to death . . . killed it , practically overnight . And why ? Why on earth was murder required ? " In the weeks that follow I attempt , between phone calls , to describe and chronicle the history of this something that , in my hopeless and de-energized state , I continue to think of as " murdered . " I speak at length now not just of Helen but of Birgitta as well . I go back to Louis Jelinek , even to Herbie Bratasky , speak of all that each meant to me , what each excited and alarmed , and of how each was dealt with , in my way . " Your rogues ' gallery , " Klinger calls them one day in the twentieth or thirtieth week of our debate . " Moral delinquency , " he observes , " has its fascination for you . " " Also , " I say , " for the authors of Macbeth and Crime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of art , Doctor . " " Quite all right . I hear all sorts of things here . I 'm used to it . " " I do seem to get the feeling that it 's somehow against house rules for me to call upon my literary reserves in these skirmishes of ours , but the only point I 'm trying to make is that moral delinquency ' has been on the minds of serious people for a long time now . And why delinquents , ' anyway ? Wo n't independent spirits ' do ? It 's no less accurate . " " I only mean to suggest that they are n't wholly harmless types . " " Wholly harmless types probably lead rather constricted lives , do n't you think ?

I can not maintain a smile , for that matter . " Whereupon his phone rings . Fastened to no one and to nothing , drifting , drifting , sometimes , frighteningly , sinking ; and , with the relentlesslyclever and commonsensical doctor , quarreling , bickering , and debating , arguing yet again the subject which had been the source of so much marital bitterness  --  only when I am supine it is generally I who wind up taking Helen 's part , while he who sits up takes mine . Each winter my parents come down to New York City to spend three or four days visiting family , friends , and favorite guests . In times gone by , we all used to stay on West End Avenue with my father 's younger brother , Larry , a successful kosher caterer , and his wife , Sylvia , the Benvenuto Cellini of strudel , and , in childhood , my favorite aunt . Until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put to bed there in the same room with my cousin Lorraine . Sleeping beside a bed with a live girl in it  --  a " developing " girl , at that  --  going out to dine at Moskowitz and Lupowitz ( on food described by my father as nearly as good as what is prepared in the kitchen of the Hungarian Royale ) , waiting in subfreezingtemperatures to get in to see the Rockettes , sipping cocoa amid the thick draperies and the imposing furnituresets of haberdashery wholesalers and produce mer/chants whom I have known only in their voluminous half-sleeve shirts and their drooping swim trunks , and who are called by my father the Apple King and the Herring King and the Pajama King  --  everything about these New York visits hold a secret thrill for me , and invariably from " overexcitement " I develop a " strep throat " on the drive home , and back on our mountaintop have to spend at least two or three days in bed recovering . " We did n't visit Herbie , " I say sullenly , only seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A summer is n't enough with him ? We have to travel to Brooklyn to make a special trip ? " " Belle , he 's teasing you , " my father says , but on the sly shakes a fist in my direction , as though for mentioning the Fart King to my mother I deserve no less than a blow to the head . Now that I am back East and my uncle and aunt live in Cedarhurst , Long Island , I respond by phone to a letter from my father and invite my parents to stay in my apartmentrather than at a hotel when they come down for their annual winter visit . The two rooms on West Seventy-fifthStreet are not actually mine but , through an ad in the Times , have been sublet , furnished , from a young actor who has gone to try his luck in Hollywood . There is a crimson damask on the bedroom walls , perfumes lined up on a bathroom shelf , and , in boxes that I discoverat the rear of the linen closet , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my curiosity and try a couple on . I look like my mother 's sister . Near the beginning of my occupancy , the phone rings one night and a man asks , " Where 's Mark ? " " He 's in California . He 'll be there for two years . " " Yeah , sure . Look ,  |p105you  just tell him Wally 's in town . " " But he 's not here . I have an address for him out there . " I begin to recite it , but the voice , grown gruff and agitated now , interrupts : " Then who are you ? " " His tenant . " " Is that what they call it in the thee-yater ? What do you look like , sweetpants ? You got big blue eyes too ? " When the calls persist , I have the telephone number changed , but then it is through the intercom that connects my apartment to the downstairshallway of the brownstone that the repartee continues . " You just tell your little pal  --  " " Mark is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ha ha  --  that 's a good one . What 's your name , honey ? Come to the doorway and we 'll see whether I can reach you .

" So the flirtation goes . Nights when I am at my loneliest , nights when I start talking to myself and to people who are not present , I sometimes have to suppress a powerful urge to call for help into the intercom . What holds me back is n't that it makes no sense but , rather , the fear that one of my neighbors or , what is worse , Patient Wally will be standing in the entryway just as my strident cry comes through ; what I fear is the kind of help I might get  --  if not my homosexual suitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom instead , close the door behind me , and leaning over the mirror to look at my own drawn face , I let it out . " I want somebody ! I want somebody ! I want somebody ! " Sometimes I can go on like this for minutes at a time in an attempt to bring on a fit of weeping that will leave me limp and , for a while atp106least , empty of longing for another . I of course am not so far gone as to believe that screaming aloud in a closedoffroom will make the somebody I want appear . Besides , who is it ? If I knew I would n't have to holler into the mirror  --  I could write or phone . I want somebody , I cry  --  and it is my parents who arrive . I carry their suitcases upstairs while my father lugs the Scotch cooler in which are packed some two-dozen round plastic containers of cabbage soup , matzoh-ball soup , kugel , and flanken , all frozen and neatly labeled . Inside the apartment my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typed exactly at the center and underlined in red . The envelope contains instructions for me typewritten on hotel stationery : time required for the defrosting and heating of each dish , details as to seasoning . " Read it , " she says , " and see if you have any questions . " My father says , " How about if he reads it after you get out of your coat and sit down ? " " I 'm fine , " she says . " You 're tired , " he tells her . " David , you have enough room in your freezer ? I did n't know how big a freezer you had here . " " Mamma , room to spare , " I say lightly . But when I open the refrigerator she groans as though her throat has just been slit . " One this and one that , and that 's it ? " she cries . " Look at that lemon , it looks older than I do . How do you eat ? " " Out , mostly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " You 've been tired , " he says to her , " and you were overdoing . " " I knew he was n't taking care of himself , " she says . " You 're the one who has to take care of herself , " he says . " What is it ? " I ask , " what 's the matter with you , Ma ? " " I had a little pleurisy , and your father is making it into a production . I get a lit/tle pain when I knit for too long . That 's the whole outcome of all the money thrown away on doctors and tests . " She does not know  --  nor do I , until my father comes with me the next morning to buy a paper and some things for breakfast and then to walk me gravely up toward where Larry and Sylvia used to put us all up on West End Avenue  --  that she is dying of cancer that has spread from the pancreas . This then explains his letter saying , " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Does it also explain her request to visit landmarks she has not been to in decades ? I almost believe she knows just what is happening and this display of exuberance is to spare him from knowing she knows . Each protecting the other from the horrible truth  --  my parents like two brave and helpless children . . . And what can I do about it ? " But dying  --  when ? " I ask him as we turn back , the two of us in tears , to my apartment . For several momentshe can not answer . " That 's the worst of it , " he manages finally to say . " Five weeks , five months , five years  --  five minutes . Every doctor tells me something different ! " And back at the apartment she asks me again , " Will you take us to Greenwich Village ? Will you take us to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ? When I worked for Mr. Clark one of the girls used to eat the most delicious green noodles at an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name . It could n't be Tony 's , could it , Abe ? " " Honeybunch , " my father says , his voice already tinged with grief , " it would n't even be there after all this time . " " We could look  --  and what if it was ! " she says , turning with excitement to me . " Oh , David , howp108Mr . Clark loved the Museum of Art ! Every Sunday when his sons were growing up he took them there to see the paintings . " I accompany them everywhere , to see the famous Rembrandts at the Metropolitan , to look for a Tony 's that serves green noodles , to visit their oldest and dearest friends , some of whom I have n't seen in over fifteen years but who kiss and embrace me as though I were still a child , and then , because I am a professor , ask me seriousquestions about the world situation ; we go , as of old , to the zoo and to the planetarium , and finally on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following lunch in Chinatown , we stand at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets on a chilly Sunday afternoon , and , as always , with perfect innocence , she reminisces about her days with the firm . And how different for her it would have been , I think , had she stayed on to be one of Mr. Clark 's girls for life , one of those virgin spinsters who adore the fatherly boss and play auntie on holidays to the boss 's children . Without the interminable demands of a family-run resort hotel , she might actually have known some serenity , have lived in accordance with her simple gifts for tidiness and order rather than at their mercy . On the other hand , she would never have known my father and me  --  we would never have been . If only , if only . . . If only what ? She has cancer . They sleep in the double bed in the bedroom while I lie awake under a blanket on the living-room sofa . My mother is about to vanish  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of her only child will be of his meager , rootlessexistence  --  her last memory will be of this lemon Ip109live with ! Oh , with what disgust and remorse do I recall the series of mistakes  --  no , the one habitual and recurrentmistake  --  that has made these two rooms my home . Instead of being enemies , of providing one another with the ideal enemy , why could n't Helen and I have put that effort into satisfying each other , into steady , dedicated living ? Would that have been so hard for two such strong-willed people ? Should I have said at the very outset , " Look , we 're having a child " ? Lying there listening to my mother breathing her last , I try to infuse myself with new resolve : I must , I will , end this purposeless , pointless . . . and into my thoughts comes Elisabeth , of all people , with the locket around her neck and her broken arm healed . How sweet , how welcoming she would be to my widowed father ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? How ever will he survive up there on his own ? Oh , why must it be Helen and Birgitta at one extreme or life with a lemon at the other ? As the sleepless minutes pass  --  or , rather , do not seem to pass at all  --  all the thoughts that can possibly distress me seem to coalesce into an unidentifiable nonsense word that will not let me be . To free myself from its insipid thralldom , I begin to toss angrily from one side of the couch to the other . I feel half in , half out of deep anesthesia  --  immersedback in the claustrophobic agonies of the recovery room , which I last saw at the age of twelve , following my appendectomy  --  until the word resolves itselfat last into nothing other than the line of keys , read from left to right , on which my mother taught me to rest the tips of my fingers when I learned typing from her on the hotel 's Remington Noiseless . But now that I know the origin of this commonplace alphabetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is a word after all , and the one that holds within its unutterable syllablesall the pain of her baffled energies and her frenetic life . And the pain of my own . I suddenly see myself strugglingwith my father over her epitaph , the two of us are hurling each other against enormous pieces of rock , while I insist to the stonecutter that ASDFGHJKL be carved beneath her name on the tombstone . I can not sleep . I wonder if it is possible that I will never be able to sleep again . All my thoughts are either simple or crazy , and after a while I can not distinguish which is which . I want to go into the bedroom and get into their bed . I rehearse in my mind how I will do it . To ease them out of their initial timidity , I will just sit first at the edge of the bed and quietly talk to them about the best of the past . Looking down at their familiar faces side by side on the fresh pillowcases , at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up to their chins , I will remind them of how very long it 's been since last we all snuggled up together under a single blanket . Was n't it in a tourist cabin just outside Lake Placid ? Remember that little box of a room ? Was it 1940 or ' 41 ? And , am I right , did n't it cost Dad just one dollar for the night ? Mother thought that it would be good for me to see the Thousand Islands and Niagara Falls during my Easter vacation . That 's where we were headed , in the Dodge . Remember , you told us how Mr. Clark took his little boys each summerto see the sights of Europe ; remember all those things you told me that I had never heard before ; God , remember me and the two of you and the little Dodge back before the war . . . and then , when they are smiling , I will take off my robe and crawl into the bed betweenp111them . And before she dies , we will all hold each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever know , aside from Klinger , and why should I care what he or anyone makes of it ? Near midnight the doorbell rings . At the intercom in the kitchenette I depress the lever and ask , " Who is it ? " " The plumber , sweetpants . Last time you were out . How 's your leak , fixed yet ? " I do n't respond . My father has come into the living room in his robe . " Somebody you know ? At this hour ? " " Just some clown , " I say , as the bell rings now to the rhythm of " Shave and a Haircut . " " What is it ? " my mother calls from the bedroom . " Nothing , Ma . Go to sleep . " I decide to speak into the intercom one more time . " Cut it out or I 'm going to call the cops . " " Call ' em . Nothing I 'm doing is actionable , kiddo . Why do n't you just let me up ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . " My father , standing now at my elbow and listening , has gone a little white . " Dad , " I say , " go back to bed . It 's just one of those things that happen in New York . It 's nothing . " " He knows you ? " " No . " " Then how does he know to come here ? Why does he talk like that ? " A pause , and the bell is ringing again . Thoroughly irritated now , I say , " Because the fellow I sublet from is a homosexual  --  and , as best I can gather , this was a friend of his . " " A Jewish fellow ? "  | " Who I rented from ? Yes . " " Jesus , " snaps my father , " what the hell is the matter with a guy like that ? " " I think I 'm going to have to go downstairs . " " By yourself ? " " I 'll be all right . " " Do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with you . " " Dad , that 's not necessary . " From the bedroom my mother calls , " Now what ? " " Nothing , " my father says . " The bell is stuck . We 're going downstairs to fix it . " " At this hour ? " she calls . " We 'll be right back , " my father says to her . " Stay in bed . " To me he whispers , " You got some kind of stick , a bat or something ? " " No , no  --  " " What if he 's armed ? You got an umbrella , at least ? " In the meantime , the ringing has stopped . " Maybe he 's gone , " I say . My father listens . " He 's gone , " I say . " He left . " My father , however , has no intention of going back to bed now . Closing the door to the bedroom  --  " Shhhh , " he whispers to my mother , " everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit across from the sofa . I can hear how heavily he is breathing as he prepares himself to speak . I am not all that relaxed myself . Propped stiffly up against the pillow , I wait for the bell to start ringing again . " You 're not involved "  --  he clears his throat  --  " with something you want to tell me about . . . " " Do n't be silly . "  | " Because you left us , Davey , when you were seventeen years old and since then there has been no interfering with the kind of influences you let yourself under . " " Dad , I 'm not under any influences . ' " " I want to ask you a question . Outright . " " Go ahead . " " It 's not about Helen . I never asked you about that , and I do n't want to start now . I always treated her like a daughter-in-law . Did n't I , did n't your mother , always with respect  --  ? " " Yes , absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want her to turn against us . She can have nothing against us to this day . All things considered , I think we did excellent . I am a liberal person , son  --  and in my politics even more than liberal . Do you know that in 1924 I voted for Norman Thomas for the governor of New York with the first vote I ever cast ? And in ' 48 I voted for Henry Wallace  --  which maybe was meaningless and a mistake , but the point is that I was probably the only hotel owner in the whole country who voted for somebody that everybody was calling a Communist . Which he was n't  --  but the point is , I have never been a narrow man , never . You know  --  and if you do n't , you should  --  it was never that the woman was a shiksa that bothered me . Shiksas are a fact of life , and they are not going to go away just because Jewish parents might like it better that way . And why should they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in harmony , and that you married a Gentile girl was never the point to your mother and me . I think we did excellent on that score . But that does n't mean I could stomach the rest of her and her attitudes . The truth of the matter , ifp114you want to know , is that I did n't have a good night 's sleep in the three years you were married . " " Well , neither did I. " " Is that true ? Then why the hell did n't you get out right off the bat ? Why did you get in that damn mess to begin with ? " " You want me to go over that territory , do you ? " " No , no  --  you 're right  --  the hell with it . As far as I 'm concerned , if I never hear her name again , that wo n't be too soon . You are all I care about . " " What do you want to ask ? " " David , what is Tofrinal , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle full ? What are you taking this drug for ? " " It 's an anti-depressant . Tofranil . " He hisses . Disgust , frustration , disbelief , contempt . I must first have heard that sound out of him a hundred years ago , when he had to fire a waiter who wet his bed and stank up the attic where the help slept . " And why do you need that ? Who told you to take a thing like that and put it in your bloodstream ? " " A psychiatrist . " " You go to a psychiatrist ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " he cries . " To keep me afloat . To figure things out . To have someone to talk to . . . confidentially . " " Why not a wife to talk to ? That 's what a wife is for ! I mean this time a real wife , not somebody who it must have cost you your whole school salary just to pay the beauty parlors . All this is all wrong , son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being on strong drugs , and peoplep115showing up at all hours  --  people who are n't even peo-ple  --  " " There is nothing to get worked up about . " " There is everything to get worked up about . " " No , no , " I say , lowering my voice . " Dad , there is only Mother . . . " He puts a hand over his eyes and quietly begins to cry . With his other hand he makes a fist which he waves at me . " This is what I have had to be all my life ! Without psychiatrists , without happy pills ! I am a man who has never said die ! " And once again , the downstairs doorbell . " Forget it . Let it ring . Dad , he 'll go away . " " And then come back ? I 'll crack his head open , and , believe me , then he 'll go away for good ! " Here the bedroom door opens and my mother appears in her nightgown . " Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stinking fairy who wo n't leave him alone ! " The bell again : two shorts , a long ; two shorts , a long . Wally is drunk . Her eyes tearful now , my tiny mother says , " And how often does this go on ? " " Not often . " " But  --  why do n't you report him ? " " Because by the time the police come he 'd be gone . You do n't want the police for something like this . " " And you swear to me , " says my father , " this is nobody you know ? " " I swear to you . " My mother comes into the living room and sits beside me . She takes my hand and clutches it . The three of us listen to the bell  --  mother , father , and son.  | " You know what would fix the son of a bitch once and for all ? " my father says . " Boiling water . " " Abe ! " cries my mother . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad , you must n't make too much of it . " " And do n't you make so little ! Why do you hang around with such people ? " " But I do n't . " " Then why do you live in a place like this , where they show up and make trouble for you ? Do you need more trouble still ? " " Calm down , please , " says my mother . " It is n't his fault some maniac rings his doorbell . This is New York . He told you . This is what happens . " " That does n't mean you leave yourself unprotected , Belle ! " Jumping up from his chair , he rushes to the intercom . " Hey ! You ! " he shouts . " Cut it out ! This is David 's father  --  ! " Stroking her arm  --  already skeletal  --  I whisper , " It 's okay , it 's all right , he 's not working the thing right anyway . Do n't worry , Ma , please  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want third-degree burns , we 'll give them to you ! Do what you want to do in some gutter somewhere , but if you know what 's good for you , do n't come near my son ! " Two months later , in the hospital in Kingston , my mother dies . After the funeral guests have all left , my father urges me to take the food she has frozen for me only the month before , the last things cooked by her on this earth . I say , " And what are you going to eat ? " " I was a short-order man before you were even born . Take it . Take what she made for you . " " Dad , how are you going top117live here by yourself ? How are you possibly going to managethe season ? Why did you shoo everybody away ? Do n't be so brave . You ca n't stay up here alone . " " I can look after myself fine . Her going is not something we did n't expect . Please , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said whenever she remembered the inside of your refrigerator , she saw red . She cooked for you , " he says , his voice trembling , " and then she went away . " He begins to sob . I put my arms around him . " Nobody understood her , " he says , " the guests , never , never . She was a good person , Davey . When she was young , everything thrilled her , the littlest things even . She had a nervous nature only when the summer got hectic and out of control . So they made fun of her . But do you remember the winter ? The peace and the quiet ? The fun we had ? Remember the letters at night ? " Those words do it : for the first time since her death the morning before , I break down completely . " Of course I do , sure I do . " " Oh , sonny , that 's when she was herself . Only who knew it ? " " We did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry sob , " And who knew it ! " He carries the frozen food in a shopping bag out to my car . " Here , please , in her memory . " And so I return to New York with the half-dozen containers each bearing the same typewritten label : " Tongue with Grandma 's famous raisin sauce  --  2 portions . " Within a week , I am driving back up to the country again , this time with my Uncle Larry , to take my father to Cedarhurst , where he will move in with his brother and sister-in-law . Though only temporarily , he says while we pack his suitcase in the car ; just till he is over the shock . In a few days he is sure he will be himself . He has to be , that 's all there is to it . " I 've been working since I'mp118fourteen years old . You do n't give in to a thing like this , " he says . " You tighten your belt and you go on . " Besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there of fire . Yes , the handyman and his wife will be living on the grounds , but that is no guarantee against the possibility of the hotel burning down in his absence . It is true , of course , that dozens of mysterious fires have broken out in abandoned hotels and boardinghouses ever since the region began to pass out of fashion as a Jewish summer resort at about the time I was going off to college , but as he and my mother have been able , even in recent years , to hang on to a remnant of their aging clientele and to keep the main house open and the grounds respectablelooking , the arsonists had never before seemed to him a real threat . But now on the drive down the Thruway they are all he can think about . He names for my uncle and me the local hoodlums  --  " Men , thirty- and forty-year-old men ! "  --  whom he has always suspected of setting the fires . " No , no , " he says to my uncle , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " not even anti-Semites . Too stupid even for that ! Just plain dementedno-good idiots , fit for the lunatic asylum . Just people who like to see flames ! And when it is in ashes , you know who they will accuse ? I 've seen it a dozen times . Me ! That I did it for the insurance money ! Because my wife is gone and I want to get out ! The blame will fall on my good name ! And half the time you know who else I sometimesthink that does it ? The volunteer fire fighters themselves ! Yes  --  so they can rush out in the fire engines in the middle of the night and ride up and down the mountain in their helmets and boots ! " Even after he is comfortably installed in what used top119be Lorraine 's bedroom , there is no calming his fears for the empire built of his sweat and his blood . Every night I call him on the phone and he tells me he can not get to sleep for worrying about a fire . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That fairy never came back , did he ? " " No , " I say , knowing it best to lie . " See  --  it paid to threaten him . Unfortunately that 's all some people understand , is the fist , " says my father , who has never struck another person in his life . " And how are Uncle Larry and Aunt Sylvia ? " I ask . " Wonderful . They could n't be kinder . Every other word is Stay . ' " " Well , that sounds reassuring , " I say . But no , another ten days , he tells me , and the worst of being without her will be over . Has to be . He has to get back up there while the damn place is still in one piece ! And then it is another five days , and then another , untilat last , following an emotional Sunday car ride alone with me , he agrees to put the Hungarian Royale up for sale . His face in his hands , he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 's no shame in it , Dad . Things have just changed . " " But I do n't give up , " he cries . " Nobody is going to see it that way , " I say , and drive him back to his brother 's . And during this time hardly a night passes when I do not think about the girl I knew for barely two months back when I was a twenty-two-year-old sexual prodigy , the girl who wore a locket around her neck with her father 's picture in it . I even think of writing to her , in care of her parents . I even get up out of bed and search through my papers , looking for the Stockholm address . But by now Elisabeth must certainly be married and a mother two or three times over , and assuredly she doesp120not think of me . No woman alive thinks of me , certainly not with love . Though my department chairman Arthur Schonbrunn is a handsome and exquisitely groomed middle-aged man of unflagging charm and punctiliousness  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in action  --  his wife , Deborah , is someone for whom I have never been able to work up much enthusiasm , even when I was Arthur 's favorite graduate student and she was frequently my affectionate and hospitable hostess . In those first years at Stanford , I used to spend a certain amount of my time , in fact , trying to figure out what bound a man so scrupulous about the amenities , so tirelessly concerned to oppose , from the highest principles , the burgeoning politicalassaults upon university curriculum  --  what bound such a man of conscience to a woman whose very favorite public performance was in the role of the dizzy dame whose beguiling charm is her reckless and impudent " candor " ? The very first time I was invited by Arthur to have dinner with the two of them , I remember thinking at the end of the evening 's conversation  --  conversation consisting largely of Deborah 's coquettishly " outrageous " chatter  --  " This is surely the loneliest man alive . " How pained and disenchanted I was at twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . . . only to be told by Arthur the following day about his wife 's " wonderful powers of observation " and her " gift " for " getting right to the heart of the problem . " And , along these lines , I remember another night , years later , when Arthur and I were working late in our offices  --  that is , Arthur was at work , while I was immobile at my desk ,  |p121ho|peless  as usual about the loveless impasse Helen and I had reached and had n't the strength or the courage to resolve . When Arthur saw me apparently looking even more benumbed than usual , he came in and , until 3 a.m. , tried his best to protect me from the crazier sort of solutions that might enter the head of a dreadfully unhappy husband having trouble getting himself to go home . Time and again he reminded me of the fine piece of work my thesis had been . The important thing now was to get back to revising it for book publication . Indeed , much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Klinger was eventually to say to me about me , my work , and Helen . And I , in turn , poured out my grievances , and at one point lowered my face to my desk and wept . " I figured it was that bad , " said Arthur . " We both did . But much as we care for you , we never felt it was our business to say anything . We 've had enough experience by now to know that always comes between friends , sooner or later . But still there were days when I wanted to shake you for being such a fool . You do n't know how many times I talked to Debbie about what could be done to get you to save yourself from all this unhappiness . Nothing was more upsetting for us than remembering what you 'd been like when you first got here , and then seeing what was happening to you with her . But I could n't do a thing , David , unless you came to me  --  and that 's not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far with people , and no further , and the result is that you 're rather more alone with yourself than many people are . I 'm not so unlike that myself . " Near the end of his vigil  --  and for the first time everp122Arthur spoke about his own personal life almost as though we were men of the same age and rank . In his twenties , when he was an instructor at Minnesota , he too had been involved with " a wildly neurotic and destructivewoman . " Scandalous public quarrels , two harrowingabortions , despair so enormous that he had actually come to think that suicide was the only way he might ever be able to extricate himself from his confusion and pain . He showed me a small scar on his hand , where this mad , pathetic little librarian , whom he could not stand and yet could not leave , had once stabbed him with a table fork at breakfast . . . And while Arthur tried to give me hope ( and guidance ) by associating his own early misfortune  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only wanted to say , " But how dare you ? What do you call what you have now ? Debbie is so common ; her spontaneity so much guile-filled playacting ; her candor so much tactless showing-off ; capriciousfor the company ; devilish for Daddy  --  Arthur , none of it means a thing , audacious behavior with nothing at stake ! While Helen  --  my God , Helen is a hundred times , Helen is a thousand times . . . " But of course I rose to no such heights of virtuous indignation , uttered no words so foolish as these about the falsity and shallowness of his wife as against the integrity , intelligence , charm , beauty , and bravery of mine  --  uxoriousness , after all , being his line , and certainly that night , dreams of uxoricide being somewhat more like mine . Is this chivalry of Arthur 's to be pitied or envied ? Is my former mentor and current benefactor a little bit of a liar , a little bit of a masochist , or is he just in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kittenishness and vaguely slatternly good looks , is the touch of the disreputable that makes bearable an otherwise stiflingly decorous life ? " Vizzied " is the diagnosis rendered by our resident poet , Ralph Baumgarten : " vizzied " or " vizzified "  --  both adjectives deriving from " vizzy , " an uncommon noun of Baumgarten 's strewn throughout his verse , rhyming with " fizzy " and " tizzy , " closely related to " fuzzy " and " buzz , " and referring , of course , to the pudenda . The vizz-ridden  --  to this class of husbands is Arthur Schonbrunnconsigned by the unmarried poet  --  are those who slavishly conform to standards of propriety and respectabilitywhich , as Baumgarten sees it , have been laid down by generations of women to disarm and domesticate men . Of which domestication the poet himself is clearly having none . I tend to agree with Baumgarten that it is in part because of his own decidedly undeferential attitude toward the other gender  --  and his sexual predilections generally  --  that the young literary roughneck is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he has , by his manner , earned the disdain of certain of our colleagues and their wives , it has not caused him to be any less flagrant about what he likes and how he likes it . For him flagrancy appears to be much of the fun . " Picked up a girl at the Modern Museum , and on our way out we ran into your pals , Kepesh . Debbie hustled the girl off to the ladies ' room to get the latest lowdown on me , and Arthur , in the course of his pleasantries , asked how long Rita and I had been friends . I told him about an hour and a half . I said we were leaving because the museum seemed to afford no comfortable corner where we mightp124go down on each other . But what , I wondered , did Arthur make of her plump little behind ? Well , he would n't tell me . Gave me a lecture on compassion , instead . " No arguing that Baumgarten throws a rather large net out to catch his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets of Manhattan , hardly a woman under fifty or a girl over fifteen passes by from whom he does not attempt to extract information that he managesto intimate is absolutely vital to his survival . " Gee , what a nice coat ! " he says , flashing his grin at a young woman in a ratty fur pushing a baby carriage . " Oh , thanks . " " May I ask what it 's made of ? What kind of an animal was that ? I never saw a coat quite like that before . " " This ? It 's a fake . " " Really ? " Within minutes he is barely this side of stupefaction ( not all of it feigned , either ) at learning that this young woman in the fake fur is already divorced , the mother of three small children , and a dropout from the University of Two Thousand Miles Away . To me , standing self-consciously off to the side , he calls , " Did you hear that , Dave ? This is Alice . Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby carriagein New York . " And no less than Baumgarten , the young mother herself now seems a little wonderstruck to have been transported such a distance in a mere twentyfouryears . Success with strangers , Baumgarten informs me , residesin never asking a question of them that ca n't be answered without thinking , and then being wholly attentive to the reply , no matter how pedestrian . " You remember your James , Kepesh  --  ' Dramatize , dramatize . ' Get these people to understand that who they are and where they 're from and what they wear is interesting . In a man/ner of speaking , momentous . That 's compassion . And , please , display no irony , will you ? Your problem is you scare ' em off with your wonderful feel for the complexity of things .

" During my first months at the university I discover that when Baumgarten 's name comes up at faculty gatheringsthere is always someone around who can not stand the sight of him , and is more than willing to say why . Debbie Schonbrunn holds that the " abomination-in-residence " would be comical were he not so  --  the word is a favorite of hers and Arthur 's  --  " destructive . " Of course in response I need say nothing : just drink my drink and start back to New York . " Oh , he 's not so bad , " I tell her . " In fact , " I add , " I sort of like him . " " And what is there to like ' so ? " Go home , Kepesh . That empty apartment is where you belong ; between this predictable discussion and that faggy apartment , there is no doubt where you will be better off . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where do I begin ? " asks Deborah ; " his contempt for women , for one thing . He is a murderous , conscienceless womanizer . He hates women . " " Looks to me as though he rather likes them . " " David , you are being contrary and disingenuous , and just a little hostile , and I 'm really not sure why . Ralph Baumgarten is an abomination and so is his poetry . I have never read anything so dehumanized in my life . Read that first book of his and see for yourselfp126just how much he likes girls . " " Well , I have n't read him yet "  --  a lie  --  " but we 've had lunch a few times . He is n't so reprehensible , as far as I can see . Could be , Deborah , that the poetry is n't exactly the man . " " Ah , but it is : mean and smug and overbearing and actually quite stupid . And what about the man ' ? That walk of his , that glide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually he has n't got a face , has he ? Just mean , flat eyes and that surly grin . The mystery is how any girl can even go near him . " " Well , he must have something . " " Or they lack something . Really , you have such innate elegance and he is a carrion vulture right down to his claws , and why you would want even to associate with him . . . " " I get along with him , " I say , shrugging my shoulders , and now put down my drink and go on home . Soon enough , news reaches me as to what Debbie 's powers of observation have uncovered in our conversation . It is what I should have expected , certainly , and probably what I deserve . The only surprise , really , is my surprise  --  that , and the vulnerability . It seems that at a dinner party at the Schonbrunns ' the hostess had announced to all in attendance that Baumgartenhas become David Kepesh 's " alter ego , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a consequence of his marriage and its " mortifying " ending . The mortifying ending in Hong Kong  --  the cocaine , the cops , the works  --  as well as mortifying tidbits from the beginning and the middle were then narrated for the edification of all . I am given these details by a nice enough man , a guest at the Schonbrunns ' , who is no part of this story , and who thought he was doing me a good turn.  |p127A  correspondence ensues . Initiated by me and , alas , perpetuatedby me too . Dear Debbie : Word has reached me that at a dinner party last week you were talking a little freely about my private affairs  --  namely , my marriage , my " mortifications , " and what you are said to have described as my " aggressive fantasies against women . " How would you know about my fantasies , if I may ask ? And why should Helen and I be the subject for dinner conversation among people most of whom I have never even met ? For the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and which we have only just had the chance to rekindle , I hope that you will refrain in the future from discussing with perfect strangers my aggressive fantasies and my mortifying history . Otherwise , it is going to be difficult for me to be myself with Arthur , and , of course , with you . Sincerely , DavidDear David : I do apologize for blabbing to people who do n't know you , and wo n't do it again . Although I would do anything if you 'll tell me the name of the s.o.b . who spilled his and/or her guts . Just so they do n't set their teeth in my rack of lamb again ! To salve your wounds , I want to add , first , that your name only came up in passing  --  alas , you were n't the subject of a whole night 's conversation  --  and , second , I think you have every justification for resenting Helen as much as you do , and , third , it is n't really so strange or shameful that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an association with a young man who punishes women the way that vulturep128does . But , if you view your friendship with him one way , and I see it another , that 's certainly all right with me  --  as I think it should be with you . Lastly , if I spoke thoughtlessly about Helen to my dinner guests , it is probably because back at Stanford she was , as you well know , rather ostentatious about herself , and consequentlya prime topic of conversation among any number of people , including your friends . And you yourself were not averse to talking about her with us , whenever you came home with Arthur . But , dear David , enough of this is enough . Will you come to have dinner with us  --  how is this Friday night ? Come , by yourself or with somebody ( other than the Visigoth ) if you like . If you bring a girl I promise I wo n't breathe a word about your misogyny all the time you 're here . Love , DebbieP.S . I 'd give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in . Dear Debbie : I ca n't say that your reply strikes me as satisfactory . You seem not at all to grasp how indiscreet you were with what you know , and think you know , about me . Surely that I shared certain confidences with Arthur , and he in turn shared them with you , can not be offered to me as a mitigating factor . Do you understand why ? Nor do I see how you can fail to realize that my marriage is still painful to me , and the pain is not lessened when I learn that it is being discussed like so much soap opera by people to whom I once unburdened myself of some of my troubles . The spirit in which your letter was written only seems to have worsened the situation for me , and I do n't see any way to accept your invitation . Davidp129Dear David : I 'm sorry you found my note unsatisfactory . Actually it was purposely superficial in tone  --  I rather thought it suited what you considered my crime . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotless reputation or invading your privacy by vicious , hurtful innuendo ? Obviously you do , and that 's monstrous , of course , but simply because you believe it to be so , does n't make it so . I apologized for speaking carelessly about you to strangers , because I know I do that sometimes . I assumed that what came back to you was just that  --  foolish and careless . I know I never said anything so awful it would cause you any pain . Remembering back to your own judgments of yourself with the ladies  --  stories of your student days , remember ?  --  I never dreamt you saw yourself as being beyond reproach . I will admit I never saw you as a perfect angel in relation to women , but neither did I think that summed you up as a person . I did enjoy you and care for you as a friend . I must say I would be very sorry to hear that you had flailed out at any of those others who were your friends in California just because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to mention you not out of unkindness , or viciousness or malice , but only because they happen to know all you have been through . I am afraid that your letter tells me more about you than I care to know . DebbieDear David : Debbie is replying to your last letter , but now I feel compelled to mix in too . It seems to me that Debbie made an effort , stopping short of abject prostration before you , to apologize for what she considered a just complaint . At the same time she tried to in/dicate by her joking tone that what she did was not as serious as you seem to feel . I agree with her from what I know about the situation , and it strikes me that your last letter , with its aggressive , exasperated , self-righteous tone , is more seriously hurtful than anything Deborah may have been guilty of . I have no idea , by the way , what you think Deborah may have said about you ( a little documentation would have helped here ) , but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lasted a few minutes and maligned you in no way . I suspect that you may have said a lot worse about her in passing conversations ( though presumablynot before strangers ) . It seems to me that friends ought to be more willing to forgive each other their occasionalfrailties . Sincerely , ArthurDear Arthur : You ca n't have it both ways : that Debbie took " a joking tone " or , as she put it , a " purposely superficial . . . tone " because that best expressed her attitude toward what was botheringme , and that simultaneously she " made an effort short of abject prostration " before me . Debbie 's indiscretion was of course forgivable , and I indicated as much in my first letter . But that she should continue , not only to be so obtuse , but to be so casual about all this , leads me to view her lapse as something other than an example of " occasional frailty " displayedby a friend . DavidDear David : I have hesitated about replying to your last letter because it left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible you could even imagine Deborah ever meant you any harm.  |p131It  is also somewhat incredible that you fail to see that in blowingup this situation as you have , you are arguing only too well for the truth of Deborah 's observation about the aggressivenature of your attitude toward women these days . Rather than pressing on with the attack , why do n't you stop and think for a moment why it was you refused to accept the apology she made for her tactlessness at the outset  --  why did you prefer instead to jeopardize our friendship in order to beat her over the head with her alleged misconduct ? Short of divorcing Debbie and sending her out in the street in rags , I do n't know what I can do that would prove sufficient to restore friendly relations between you . I 'd be grateful to hear any suggestions . Sincerely , ArthurIt is Klinger who mercifully utters the magic formula that puts an end to all this . I tell him what I intend to say in my next message to Arthur  --  already half typed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now like to tighten around my neck . And I am still a little wild about his request , two letters back ( and tucked betweenparentheses ) , for " a little documentation . " What does he think we are , student and teacher , still Ph.D . candidate and dissertation adviser ? Those letters were n't sent him for a grade ! I do n't care how beholden I am supposed to be  --  I wo n't have them saying I am something I am not ! I will not be maligned and belittled by her reckless neurotic slander ! Nor will I let Helen be slandered either ! " Aggressive fantasies " ! All that means is 1 ca n't stand her ! And why the hell does n't he throw her out into the street in rags ? It 's a marvelous idea ! I 'd respect him for it ! The whole community would !  |p132When  my day 's tirade has run its course , Klinger says , " So she gossips about you  --  who the hell pays any atten-tion ? " Eleven words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see myself for the neurotic fool . So peevish ! So purposelessstill ! Without focus , without meaning  --  without a single friend ! And making only enemies ! My angry letters to the Devoted Couple constitute the whole of my criticalwriting since my return to the East , all I have been able to marshal sufficient concentration , stamina , and wisdom to get down on paper . Why , I spend entire eveningsrewriting them for brevity and tone . . . while my Chekhov book has all but been abandoned . Imagine  --  drafts and drafts , and of what ? Nothing ! Oh , something about the drift of things does n't look right to me , Doctor . Fending off Wally , fighting with Debbie , hanging on for dear life to your apron strings  --  oh , where is the way of living that will make all this nothingness truly nothing , instead of being all I have and all I do ? Strangely , my run-in with the Schonbrunns serves to enlivena friendship with Baumgarten that had n't really amounted to much before  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old vested interests contending for a say in my new and barely lived-in life . Following what I take to be doctor 's orders , I abandon the Schonbrunn correspondence  --  thoughindignant rejoinders , clinching rejoinders , continue to provide lively company as I drive along the Expressway to school each morning  --  and then late one afternoon , acting on what I assume at the time to be a harmless impulse , I stop at Baumgarten 's office and ask him to join me for coffee . And the following Sun/day evening , when I return from a visit to my father and find that back in my apartment I am , on the scale of loneliness , hovering near a hundred  --  right up there with my own dad  --  I turn down the flame under the soup I am warming in my little spinster 's saucepan , and telephone Baumgarten to invite him to come share the very last containerof food prepared and frozen by my mother . Soon we are meeting once a week for dinner at a small Hungarian restaurant on upper Broadway , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wally is Baumgarten the someone for whom I used to cry out before the bathroommirror during my first months of mourning in New York ( the mourning that preceded the mourning for the only one of us who actually died ) . But then that longedforsomeone may very likely never turn up  --  because in fact she already did : was here , was mine , and has been lost , destroyed because of some terrible mechanism that causes me to challenge and challenge  --  finally to challengeto the death  --  what once I thought I wanted most . Yes , I miss Helen ! Suddenly I want Helen ! How meaninglessand ridiculous all those arguments seem now ! What a gorgeous , lively , passionate creature ! Bright , funny , mysterious  --  and gone ! Oh , why on earth did I do what I did ? It all should have been so different ! And when , if ever , will there be another ? So  --  little more than a decade of adult life behind me , and already I have the sense that all my chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over that patheticlittle enameled saucepan , I invariably feel as though I have not simply been through a bad marriage but in fact through all the female sex , and that I am so constructed as to live harmoniously with no one.  |p134Over  cucumber salad and stuffed cabbage ( not bad , but nothing to compare , I inform Baumgarten  --  and sounding not so unlike my father  --  to the Hungarian Royale in its heyday ) , I show him an old picture of Helen , as inviting and seductive a passport photo as may ever have passed through customs . I have unstapled it from her InternationalDriver 's License , which turned up only recently  --  to each his own discordances and incongruities  --  in a carton of Stanford papers , among my lecture notes on Francois Mauriac . I bring Helen 's photograph to dinner with me , then wonder for half the meal whether to take it out of my wallet or , rather , wonder why I would . Some ten days earlier I had brought the picture to his office to show to Klinger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been to certain dire consequences , I was by no means blind to everything . " A real beauty , " says Baumgarten when , with some of the anxiety of a student handing in a plagiarized paper , I pass the picture across the table . And then I am hanging on to his every word ! " A queen bee , all right , " he says . " Yes , sir , and followed aloft by the drones . " He is a long time savoring it . Too long . " Makes me jealous , " he informs me , and not to be polite either . He is reporting a genuine emotion . Well , I think , at least he wo n't disparage her , or me . . . yet I am reluctant to go ahead now and try to puzzle out anything truly personal in Baumgarten 's presence , as though any challenge he might offer to Klinger 's perspective  --  andthe willingness with which I now try to yield to it  --  might actually send me reeling , perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would start off the day on my knees . It hardly pleases me , of course , to feel so sus/ceptible still to this sort of confusion , or to feel so very thinly protected from the elements by my therapy , or to find that , at this moment , I seem to share Debbie Schonbrunn'ssense of Baumgarten as a source of contamination . The fact is that I do look forward to our evening out together , that I am interested in listening to the stories he tells , stories , as with Helen , of someone on the friendliestof terms with the sources of his excitement , and confidently opposed to  --  in fact , rather amused by  --  all that stands in opposition . Yet it is also a fact that my attachment to Baumgarten is increasingly marked by uncertainty , by what amount at times almost to seizures of doubt , the stronger our friendship grows . Baumgarten 's family story is pretty much a story of pain and little else . The father , a baker , died only recently , destitute and alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted his family sometime during Baumgarten 's adolescence ( " later rather than sooner " ) , and only after years of horrific depressions that had all but turned family life into one long tearful wake . Baumgarten 's mother had worked for thirty years stitching gloves in a loft near Penn Station , fearful of the boss , of the shop steward , of the subway platform and the third rail , then at home afraid of the cellar stairs , the gas oven , the fuse box , even of a hammer and a nail . She had suffered a disabling stroke when Ralph was at college , and since has been staring at the wall in a Jewish home for the aged and infirm in Woodside . Every Sunday morning when her youngest child pays his visit  --  wearing that cocky grin on his face , bearingthe Sunday News under his arm , and in his hand carrying a little paper bag from the delicatessen with her bagel in it  --  the nurse precedes him into the room with ap136perky introduction intended to give a lift to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safe at last from all the world 's weaponry : " Guess who 's here with the goodies , Mildred . Your professor ! " Aside from those expenses of the mother 's care which are not covered by the government and which Baumgarten pays out of his university salary , there has also fallen to him a father 's responsibilities to his older sister , who lives in New Jersey with three children and a husband who haplessly runs a dry-cleaning store there . The three kids Uncle Baumgarten describes as " dummies " ; the sisterhe describes as " lost , " raised from infancy on the mother 's terrors and the father 's gloom , and now , at about my age , alive to nothing but a welter of superstitions which , says Baumgarten , have come through untouched from the shtetl . Because of her looks , and her clothes , and the odd things she says to her children 's schoolmates , she is known as the " gypsy lady " in the Paramus housing development where the family lives . It surprises me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inextinguishable survivor , that Baumgarten has never , to my knowledge , written a single line about the way in which his unhappy family is unlike any other , or about why he can not turn his back on the wreckage , despite the disgust aroused in him by memories of his upbringing in this household of the dead . No , not a single word on that subject in his two books of verse , the first impudently titled , at twenty-four , Baumgarten 's Anatomy , and the most recent , called after a line from an erotic poem of Donne 's , Behind , Before , Above , Between , Below . I must admit to myself  --  if not to a Schonbrunnthatafter a week of Baumgarten as bedtime reading , thep137interest I have long had in the fittings and fixtures of the other sex seems to me just about sated . Yet , narrow as his subject strikes me  --  or , rather , his means of exploration  --  Ifind in the blend of shameless erotomania , microscopicfetishism , and rather dazzling imperiousness a character at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity . But then at first even watching him eat his dinner arouses my curiosity  --  it is as hard at times for me to watch as it is to look away . Is it really the untamed animal in him that causes this carnivore to tear at the meat between his teeth with such stupendous muscle power , or does he not masticate his food genteelly simply because the rest of us agree to do it that way ? Where did he first eat flesh , in Queens or in a cave ? One night the sight of Baumgarten 's incisors severing the meat from the bone of his breaded veal chop sends me home later to my bookshelves to take down the collection of Kafka 's stories and to reread the final paragraphof " A Hunger Artist , " the description of the young panther who is put into the sideshow cage to replace the professional abstinent after he expires of starvation . " The food he liked was brought without hesitation by the attendants , he seemed not even to miss his freedom ; his noble body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , seemed to carry freedom around with it too ; somewhere in its jaws it seemed to lurk . . . " Yes , and what " it " lurks in these strong jaws ? Freedom also ? Or something more like the rapacity of one once very nearly buried alive ? Are his the jaws of the noble panther or of the starved rat ? I ask him , " How come you 've never written about your family , Ralph ? " " Them ? " he says , giving me his indulgentp138look . " Them , " I say , " and you . " " Why ? So I can read to a full house at the Y ? Oh , Kepesh "  --  five years my junior , he nonetheless enjoys talking to me as though I am the kid and , too , something of an unredeemable square  --  " spare me the subject of the Jewish family and its travails . Can you actually get worked up over another son and another daughter and another mother and another father driving each other nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those meals . And do n't forget the nzenschlichkeit . And the baffled quest for dignity . Oh , and the goodness . You ca n't write that stuff and leave out the goodness . I understand somebody has just published a whole book on our Jewish literature of goodness . I expectany day to read that an Irish critic has come out with a work on conviviality in Joyce , Yeats , and Synge . Or an article by some good old boy from Vanderbilt on hospitalityin the Southern novel : Make Yourself at Home : The Theme of Hospitality in Faulkner 's " A Rose for Emily . " ' " " I just wondered if it might not give you access to other feelings . " He smiles . " Let the other guys have the other feelings , okay ? They 're used to having them . They like having them . But virtue is n't my bag . Too bo-ring . " A favorite word , sung by Baumgarten with the interval of a third between the two syllables . " Look , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chekhov , that holy of holies . Why is n't he ever implicated in the shit ? You 're an authority . Why is the brute never Anton but some other slob ? " " That 's a strange way to go at Chekhov , you know , expectingCeline . Or Genet . Or you . But then maybe the brute is n't always Baumgarten , either . It does n't soundp139that way when you tell me about those visits to Paramus , or to the old-age home . Sounds more like Chekhov , actually . The family serf . " " Do n't be too sure . Besides , besides , why bother to write that kind of stuff down ? Has it not been done  --  and done ? Do they need me too to scratch my name on the Wailing Wall ? For me the books count  --  my own included  --  wherethe writer incriminates himself . Otherwise , why bother ? To incriminate the other guy ? Best leave that to our betters , do n't you think , and that cunningYiddish theater they 've evolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , with their rituals of rebellion and atonement ! Ever read them on the front of the Sunday Times ? All the closet cunt hunters coming on like old man Tolstoy . All that sympathy for the humble of the earth , all that guarding of the sacred flame , which , by the way , do n't cost them a fucking dime . Look , all those deeply suffering Jewish culture-bearersneed a fallen Jewish ass to atone for their sins on in public  --  so why not mine ? Keeps their wives in the dark ; gives their girl friends someone sensitive to suffering to suck off ; and goes a very long way with the Brandeis Kollege of Musical Knowledge . Every year I read in the papers about the powers-that-be up there awarding them merit badges for their neckerchiefs . Virtue , virtue , who 's got the virtue ? Biggest Jewish racket since Meyer Lansky in his prime . " Yes , he is steamed up now , and with no regard for the loudness of his voice or the windmilling of his arms  --  and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the lasciviousness ( well known to all Manhattan , Baumgarten claims ) of the " esteemed professor " whop140demolished his second book of poems in an omnibus reviewin the Times . " No culture , ' no heart , ' and what is worse , no historical perspective . ' As if the esteemed professorhas historical perspective when he is sticking it into some graduate assistant ! No , they do n't like it too much when you get down in there and burrow away just for the sake of the fishy little vizzy in your face . No , no , if you 're a real man of letters in the humanist tradition you have historical perspective while you 're doing it . " Not till we down our tea and strudel does he finish ( for the night ) with his investigation into the hypocrisies , pieties , and bo-ring-ness generally of the literary world and the humanist tradition ( largely as it is embodied in the reviewers of his books and the members of his department ) , and begin to speak , with a different sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like so many of his stories of the pleasant surprises that the hunt turns up , what he narrates over the dregs of dessert touches upon certain old but vivid recollections of my own . Indeed , there are times when , listening to him speak with such shamelessness of the wide range of his satisfactions , I feel that I am in the presence of a parodied projection of myself . A parody  --  a possibility . Maybe Baumgarten feels somewhat the same about me , and this explains the curiosity at either end . I am a Baumgarten locked in the Big House , caged in the kennels , a Baumgarten Klingered and Schonbrunned into submission  --  while he is a Kepesh , oh , what a Kepesh ! with his mouth frothing and his long tongue lolling , leash slipped and running wild . Why am I here with him ? Passing time , sure , sure  --  and meanwhile , what is passing in and out of me ? In thep141presence of the appetitious Baumgarten , am I looking to be exposed ever so mildly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or am I half hoping to be reinfected ? Have I taken the healing of myself into my own hands at last , or is it rather that the convalescence is over , and I am just about ready to begin to conspire against the doctor and his bo-ring admonitions ? " One night last winter , " he says , eyeing the round rear end of the largish Hungarian waitress who is trundlingin carpet slippers back to the kitchen to make us some more tea , " I was browsing in Marboro 's  --  " And I can see him browsing already ; I have seen it , a dozen times at least . BAUMGARTEN : Hardy ? GIRL : Why  --  yes . BAUMGARTEN : Tess of the d'Urbervilles , is that what you 've got there ? GIRL ( looking at the book jacket ) : That 's right , it is  --  "  --  and I started talking to this nice red-cheeked girl who told me she had just come down on the train from visiting her family in Westchester . Sitting a couple of seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and tie and an overcoat who kept looking back at her over his shoulder and jacking off under the coat . I asked her what she did about it . What do you think I did ? ' she said . I looked him right in the eye , and when we got into Grand Central , I went up to him , and I said , " Hey , I think we should meet , I 'd like to meet you . " ' Well , he took off , started running out of the station , but the girl kept right on him , trying to explain to him that she was serious  --  she liked the way he looked , she admired his courage , she was terrifically flattered by what he had done , but the guy disappeared into a taxi before she could convincehim that he was in for a good time . Anyway , we struck it off , you might say , and went back to her apart/ment . It was over on the East River , in one of those hirisevillages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , and the kitchen with all the cookbooks , and then she wanted me to take off her clothes and tie her to the bed . Well , I have n't played with a rope since Troop 35 , but I managed . Did it with dental floss , Kepesh , twelve yards of it  --  got her spread-eagled , arms and legs , just the way she wanted . Took me forty-five minutes . And you should have heard the sounds coming out of that girl . You should have seen what she looked like , excited like that . Very stirring image . Makes you understand the creeps more . Anyway , she told me to go and get the poppers out of the medicine chest . Well , there were n't any , they were all gone . It seems one of her friends had stolen them . So I told her I had some coke at home , and I 'd get it if she wanted me to . Go , get it , get it , ' she said . So I went .

Kepesh , I was stymied , " he says , and reaching across the table with a thumb and forefinger to get the strudel crumbs off my plate , manages to sweep my water glass into my lap with the cuff of his army coat . For some reason Baumgarten always eats in his coat . Maybe Jesse James did , too . " Oops , " he cries , seeing the glass go down , but of course this is n't the first time ; indeed , " oops " may be the four-letter word that most frequently falls from Baumgarten 's lips , certainly while he is turning the table into his trough . " Sorry , " he says ; " you all right ? " " It 'll dry , " I say , " it always does . Go on . What did you do ?

I told him I must be in the wrong building , but when I went out he followed me into the portico area there , and so I hung around for about a minute or two , looking up and admiring the moon . And then I went home . And after that I bought the Daily News on the way to school every day . I looked in there for weeks to see if the cops had found a skeleton tied to a bed with dental floss over on the decadent East Side . Finally I just gave up .

I 've gotten you your fifteen-year-old ( eighteen , actually , but fleshwise I 'll swear you 'd never know the difference , and anyway , fifteen is jail )  --  a succulent sophomore , and not just young but a real beauty besides , a sweet girl and worldly both , and altogether I ca n't see how you could improve on her . I found her for you all by myself , her name is Rona and we are having lunch next week , so if you meant it ( assuming you do remember mentioning this fancy ) , I will open negotiations at this time . I feel reasonably confident of success . Kindly semaphore your intentions next time you 're in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I should go ahead . So there 's my half of the bargain  --  I 'm procuring for you , as desired and with my heart somewhere up near my mouth  --  now please put me in touch with the orgiasts . The only good reasons for no that I can think of are ( a ) you are involved there yourself  --  and in that case I would simply abstain from those soirees , if you prefer  --  or ( b ) you 're afraid of being compromised by somebody at the heart of the Kremlin  --  then just give me the name and I 'll say I heard about it elsewhere than you . Otherwise , why not give your ( slightly atrophied ) faculty of humanp145sympathy a little workout ( I 've read somewhere it was once believed to be an essential quality for a poet ) as long as it wo n't cost you anything , and bring a little ray of sunshine into the dim life of a ( rapidly ) fading spinster . Your chum , T.And who is " T , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistantto the provost or the director of student health ? And who  --  on another piece of paper  --  is " L " ? Her words crossed out and rewritten on every line ; her felt-tipped pen on the brink of anemia  --  what does she want of the poet with the slightly atrophied heart ? Is " L " ' s the pleading voice Baumgarten is so patiently listening to in the telephone booth ? Or is that " M , " or " N " or " 0 " or " P "  --  ? Ralph , I refuse to be sorry about last night unless you can point out in a believable way there was something twisted or mean about my wanting to see you . I had thought that if I could only sit in the same room with a man who was n't trying to push me or convince me or confuse me , someone whom I liked and respected , that I might get closer to something in myself that matters and is real . I was under the impression that you did n't live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby whether I do . I did n't want to make love . Sometimes you act like someone who is adept at removinga lady 's drawers and that 's all . I certainly wo n't make any more spontaneous visits after to p.m . It is just that wanting and needing to talk to someone with whom I am not involved , I chose you , when , I admit , in some way I want to be involved , some part wanting to be in your arms , when the other part insists that what I really need is your friendship , yourp146advice  --  and distance . I guess I do n't quite want to admit that you move me . But that does n't mean I do n't think there is something crazy about youInside the booth , Baumgarten hangs up the phone and so I stop reading his fan mail . We pay Eva , Baumgarten collects his property , and together  --  his " pal " on the phone is best left to herself this evening , he informs me  --  we head toward the nearest Bookmasters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us will lay out five dollars for five remaindered books he most likely will never get around to reading . " Inebriate of cunt and print ! " as my secret sharer exclaims somewhere in the song of himself behind , before , above , between , below . It takes two full weeks , six whole sessions , before I am able to tell the psychoanalyst to whom I am supposed to tell everything that only a little later that evening we had met a high school girl shopping for a paperback for her English class . ( BAUMGARTEN : Emily or Charlotte ? GIRL : Charlotte . BAUMGARTEN : Villette or Jane Eyre ? GIRL : I never heard of the first one . Jane Eyre . ) Breezy , streetwise , and just a little terrified , she had accompanied us back to Baumgarten 's one room , and there , on his Mexicanrug , amid several piles of his own two erotic books of verse , she had auditioned for a modeling job for the new erotic picture magazine being started on the West Coast by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Schonbrunns , " he explains , " are sick and tired of pulling their punches . " A lanky strawberry blonde in fringed leather jacketp147and jeans , the girl had told us straight out , while being interviewed in the bookstore , that she would not be at all shy about taking off her clothes for a photographer  --  so , at Baumgarten 's , she is given one of his Danish magazines to look at , for the inspiration in it . " Could you do this , Wendy ? " he asks her earnestly as she sits on the sofa leafing through the magazines with one hand and , with the other , holding the Baskin-Robbins ice cream cone that Baumgarten ( the impeccable scenarist ) could n't resist buying for her on the way home . ( " What 's your favorite flavor , Wendy ? Go ahead , please , have a double dip , have sprinkles , have everything . How about you , Dave ? Want some Chocolate Ribbon , too ? " ) Clearing her throat , she closes the magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone , and casually as she can manage , says , " That 's a little far for me . " " What is n't ? " he asks her ; " just tell me what is n't . " " Maybe something more along the lines of Playboy , " she says . Working together then , something like teammates movingthe ball across the midcourt line against a tight defense , something like two methodical day laborers driving a post into the ground with alternating blows of their mallets  --  something like Birgitta and myself back on the continent of Europe during the Age of Exploration  --  we manage , by bringing her through a series of provocative postures in progressive stages of undress , to get her flat on her back in her bikini underpants and her boots . And that , says the seventeen-year-old senior from Washington IrvingHigh  --  trembling ever so slightly as she gazes up at our four eyes looking down  --  that is as far as she will go . What next ? That her limit is to be the limit is understood by Baumgarten and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klinger  --  also point out that no tears were shed , no force used , not so much as a fingertiptouched her flesh . " And this happened when ? " Klinger asks me . " Two weeks ago , " I say , and rise from the couch to get my coat . And leave . I have withheld my confession for two full weeks , and even now , until the end of the hour . Consequently , I am able just to walk out the door , and do not have to add  --  and never will  --  that it was not a recidivist 's shame that deterred me from narrating the incident earlier , but rather the small color snapshot of Klinger 's teenage daughter , in faded dungarees and school T-shirt , taken on a beach somewhere and displayed in a triptych frame on his desk between photographs of his two sons.  |p149And  then the summer after I return East I meet a young woman altogether unlike this small band of consolers , counselors , tempters , and provocateurs  --  the " influences , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsexed carcass has been careening since I 've been a womanless , pleasureless , passionless man on his own . I am invited for a weekend on Cape Cod by a faculty couple I have just gotten to know , and there I am introduced to Claire Ovington , their young neighbor , who is renting a tiny shingled bungalow in a wild-rose patch near the Orleans beach for herself and her golden Labrador . Some ten days after the morning we spend talking together on the beach  --  after I have sent her a painfully charming letter from New York , and consulted for several clammy hours with Klinger  --  I take the impulse by the horns and return to Orleans , where I move into the local inn . I am drawn at first by the same look of soft voluptuousnessthat had ( against all seemingly reasonable reservations ) done so much to draw me to Helen , and which has touched off , for the first time in over a year , a spon/taneous surge of warm feeling . Back in New York after my brief weekend visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renewal of desire , of confidence , of capacity ? Not quite yet . During my week at the inn , I can not stop behaving like an overzealous child at dancing class , unable to go through a door or to raise a fork without the starchiest display of good manners . And after the selfdisplayof that letter , that bravura show of wit and selfassurance ! Why did I listen to Klinger ? " Of course , go  --  what can you lose ? " But what does he have to lose if I fail ? Where 's his tragic view of life , damn it ? Impotenceis no joke  --  it 's a plague ! People kill themselves ! And alone in my bed at the inn , after yet another evening of keeping my distance from Claire , I can understand why . In the morning , just before I am to leave for New York once again , I arrive at her bungalow for an early breakfast , and midway through the fresh blueberry pancakes try to redeem myself a little by admitting to my shame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this with at least some self-esteem intact , though why I will ever have to care about self-esteem again I can not imagine . " I seem to have come all the way up here  --  after writing to you like that , and then arriving out of nowhere  --  well , after all that fanfare , I seem to have come upon the scene and . . . disappeared . " And now moving over me  --  moving right up to the roots of my hair  --  I feel something very like the shame that I must have imagined I could avoid by disappearing . " I must seem odd to you . At this point I seem odd to myself . I 've seemed odd to myselffor some time now . I 'm only trying to say that it 's nothing you 've done or said that 's made me behave so coldly . " " But , " she says , before I can begin another roundp151of apology about this " oddity " that I am , " it 's been so pleasant . In a way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I say , fearful that I am about to be humbled in some unforeseenway . " What has ? " " Seeing somebody shy for a change . It 's nice to know it still exists in the Age of Utter Abandon . " God , as tender within as without ! The tact ! The calm ! The wisdom ! As physically alluring to me as Helen  --  but there the resemblance ends . Poise and confidence and determination , but , in Claire , all of it marshaled in behalf of something more than high sybaritic adventure . At twenty-four , she has earned a degree from Cornell in experimental psychology , a master 's from Columbia in education , and is on the faculty of a private school in Manhattan , where she teaches eleven- and twelve-year-olds , and , as of the coming semester , will be in charge of the curriculum-review committee . Yet , for someone who , as I come to learn , emanates in her professional role a strong aura of reserve , a placid , coolheaded , and seemingly unassailablepresence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life , and , as regardsher friends , her plants , her herb garden , her dog , her cooking , her sister Olivia , who summers on Martha 's Vineyard , and Olivia 's three children , she has about as much reserve as a healthy ten-year-old girl . In all , this translucent mix of sober social aplomb and domestic ' enthusiasmsand youthful susceptibility is simply irresistible . What I mean is no resistance is necessary . A tempter of a kind to whom I can at last succumb . Now it is as if a gong has been struck in my stomach when I recall  --  and I do , daily  --  that I had written Claire my clever , flirtatious letter , and then had very nearly beenp152content to leave it at that . Had even told Klinger that writing out of the blue to a voluptuous young woman I had spoken with casually on a beach for two hours was a measure of just how hopeless my prospects had become . I had almost decided against showing up for breakfast that last morning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convalescent desire might have in store for me were I , with a suitcase in one hand and my plane ticket in the other , to try to put it to a crazy last-minute test . How ever did I manage to make it past my shameful secret ? Do I owe it to sheer luck , to ebullient , optimistic Klinger , or do I owe everything I now have to those breasts of hers in that bathing suit ? Oh , if so , then bless each breast a thousand times ! For now , now I am positively exultant , thrilled , astonished  --  grateful for everything about her , for the executive dispatch with which she orders her life as for the patience that she brings to our lovemaking , that canniness of hers that seems to sense exactly how much raw carnality and how much tender solicitude it is going to require to subdue my tenacious anxiety and renew my faith in coupling and all that may come in its wake . All the pedagogic expertise bestowed upon those sixth-graders is now bestowed upon me after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my apartment each day , and yet always the hungry woman with her ! And those breasts , those breasts  --  large and soft and vulnerable , each as heavy as an udder upon my face , as warm and heavy in my hand as some fat little animal fast asleep . Oh , the look of this large girl above me when she is still half stripped ! And , mind you , an assiduous keeper of records as well ! Yes , the history of each passing day in calendar books going back through college , her life'sp153history in the photographs she has been taking since childhood , first with a Brownie , now with the best equipmentfrom Japan . And those lists ! Those wonderful , orderly lists ! I too write out on a yellow pad what I plan to accomplish each day , but by bedtime I seem never to find a soothing little check mark beside each item , confirmingthat the letter has been dispatched , the money withdrawn , the article xeroxed , the call made . Despite my own strong penchant for orderliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still mornings when I ca n't even locate the list I drew up the night before , and , usually , what I do n't feel like doing one day , I am able to put off to the next without too many qualms . Not so with Mistress Ovington  --  to every task that presents itself , regardless of how difficult or dreary , she gives her complete attention , taking each up in its turn and steadfastly followingit through to its conclusion . And , to my great good luck , reconstituting my life is apparently just such a task . It is as though at the top of one of her yellow pads she has spelled out my name and then , beneath , in her open sphericalhand , written instructions to herself , as follows : " ProvideDK with  --  1 . Loving kindness . 2 . Impassioned embraces. 3 . Sane surroundings . " For within a year the job is somehow done , a big check mark beside each life-saving item . I give up the anti-depressants , and no abyss opens beneath me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much by memories of the handsome rugs , tables , dishes , and chairs once jointly owned by Helen and me and now hers alone , I furnish a new place of my own . I even accept an invitation to a dinner party at the Schonbrunns ' , and at the end of the evening politely kiss Debbie 's cheek while Arthur paternally kissesp154Claire 's . Easy as that . Meaningless as that . At the door , while Arthur and Claire conclude the conversation they 'd been having at dinner  --  about the curriculum that Claire is now devising for the upper grades  --  Debbie and I have a moment to chat privately . For some reason  --  alcoholic intake on both sides , I think  --  we are holding hands ! " Another of your tall blondes , " says Debbie , " but this one seems a bit more sympathetic . We both find her very sweet . And very bright . Where did you meet ? " " In a brothel in Marrakesh . Look , Debbie , is n't it about time you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall blondes ' ? " " It 's a fact . " " No , it is not even a fact . Helen 's hair was auburn . But suppose it was cut from the same bolt as Claire 's  --  the fact is that blondes , ' in that context , and that tone , is , as you may even know , a derogatory term used by intellectualsand other serious people to put down pretty women . I also believe it is dense with unsavory implicationwhen addressed to men of my origin and complexion . I remember how fond you used to be at Stanford of pointingout to people the anomaly of a literate chap like myselfcoming from the Borscht Belt . ' That too used to strike me as a bit reductive . " " Oh , you take yourself too seriously . Why do n't you just admit you have a penchant for these big blondes and leave it at that ? It 's nothing to be ashamed of . They do look lovely up on water skis with all that hair streaming . I bet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a deal with you . I 'll admit I know nothing about you , if you 'll admit you know nothing about me . I 'm sure you have a whole wondrous being and inner life that I know nothing about . " " Nope , " she says , " this is it . This is the whole thing . Take it or leave it . " Both of us begin to laugh . I say , " Tell me , what doesp155Arthur see in you ? It 's really one of the mysteries of life . What do you have that I 'm blind to ? " " Everything , " she replies . Out in the car , I give Claire an abridged version of the conversation . " The woman is warped , " I say . " Oh , no , " says Claire , " just silly , that 's all . " " She tricked you , Clarissa . Silly is the cover  --  assassination is the game . " " Ah , sweetie , " says Claire , " it 's you she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into society . As for my father and his awesome loneliness , well , now he takes the train from Cedarhurst to have dinner in Manhattanonce a month ; he ca n't be coaxed in any more often , but in truth , before there was the new apartment , and Claire to help with the conversation and the cooking , I did n't work at coaxing him that hard , no , not so each of us could sit and peer sadly at the other picking at his spareribs , two orphans in Chinatown . . . not so I could wait to hear him ask over the lichee nuts , " And that guy , he has n't come back to bother you , has he ? " And , to be sure , from the maw of that maelstrom called Baumgarten I withdraw my toes a little . We still have lunch together from time to time , but the grander feasts I leave him to partake of on his own . And I do not introduce him to Claire . My , how easy life is when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ! One night , after dinner at my apartment , while Claire is preparing her next day 's lessons at the cleared dining table , I finally get up the nerve , or no longer seem to need " nerve , " to reread what there is of my Chekhov book , shelved now for more than two years . In the midst of the laborious and deadly competence of those fragmentary chapters intended to focus upon the subject of **27;4145;TOOLONG , I find five pages that are somewhat readable  --  reflectionsgrowing out of Chekhov 's comic little story , " Man in a Shell , " about the tyrannical rise and celebratedfall  --  " I confess , " says the goodhearted narrator after the tyrant 's funeral , " it is a great pleasure to bury people like Belikov "  --  the rise and fall of a provincial high school official whose love of prohibitions and hatred of all deviations from the rules manages to hold a whole town of " thoughtful , decent people " under his thumb for fifteen years . I go back to reread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About Love , " written in sequence with it and forming a series of anecdotal ruminations upon the varieties of pain engendered by spiritual imprisonment  --  by petty despotism , by ordinary human complacency , and finally , even by the inhibitions upon feeling necessary to support a scrupulous man 's sense of decency . For the next month , with a notebook on my lap , and some tentative observations in mind , I return to Chekhov 's fiction nightly , listening for the anguished cry of the trapped and miserablesocialized being , the well-bred wives who during dinner with the guests wonder " Why do I smile and lie ? " , and the husbands , seemingly settled and secure , who are " full of conventional truth and conventional deception . " Simultaneously I am watching how Chekhov , simply and clearly , though not quite so pitilessly as Flaubert , reveals the humiliations and failures  --  worst of all , the destructivepower  --  of those who seek a way out of the shell of restrictions and convention , out of the pervasive boredom and the stifling despair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into what they take to be a vibrant and desirable life . There is the agitated young wife in " Misfortune " who looks for " a bit of excite/ment " against the grain of her own offended respectability ; there is the lovesick landowner in " Ariadne , " confessingwith Herzogian helplessness to a romantic misadventurewith a vulgar trampy tigress who gradually transforms him into a hopeless misogynist , but whom he nonetheless waits on hand and foot ; there is the young actress in " A Boring Story , " whose bright , hopeful enthusiasm for a life on the stage , and a life with men , turns bitter with her first experiences of the stage and of men , and of her own lack of talent  --  " I have no talent , you see , I have no talent and . . . and lots of vanity . " And there is " The Duel . " Every night for a week ( with Claire only footsteps away ) I reread Chekhov 's masterpieceabout the weaseling , slovenly , intelligent , literarymindedseducer Layevsky , immersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonist , the ruthless punitive conscience who all but murders him , the voluble scientist Von Koren . Or so it is that I come to view the story : with Von Koren as the ferociously rational and merciless prosecutor called forth to challenge the sense of shame and sinfulness that is nearly all that Layevsky has become , and from which , alas , he no longer can flee . It is this immersion in " The Duel " that finally gets me writing , and within four months the five pages extracted from the old unfinished rehash of my thesis on romantic disillusionmentare transformed into some forty thousand words entitled Man in a Shell , an essay on license and restraint in Chekhov 's world  --  longings fulfilled , pleasures denied , and the pain occasioned by both ; a study , at bottom , of what makes for Chekhov 's pervasive pessimism about the methods  --  scrupulous , odious , noble , dubious  --  by which the men and women of his time try in vain to achieve " that sense of personal freedom " to which Chekhov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedication page that reads " To C.O. " " She is to steadiness , " I tell Klinger ( and Kepesh , who must never , never , never forget ) , " what Helen was to impetuosity . She is to common sense what Birgitta was to indiscretion . I have never seen such devotion to the ordinarybusiness of daily life . It 's awesome , really , the way she deals with each day as it comes , the attention she pays minute by minute . There 's no dreaming going on there  --  just steady , dedicated living . I trust her , that 's the point I 'm making . That 's what 's done it , " I announce triumphantly , " trust . " To all of which Klinger eventually replies goodbye then and good luck . At the door of his office on the spring afternoonof our parting , I have to wonder if it can really be that I no longer need bucking up and holding down and hearing out , warning , encouragement , consent , consolation , applause , and opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple friendship three times a week for an hour . Can it be that I 've come through ? Just like that ? Just because of Claire ? What if I awaken tomorrow morning once again a man with a crater instead of a heart , once again without a man 's capacity and appetite and strength and judgment , withoutthe least bit of mastery over my flesh or my intelligenceor my feelings . . . " Stay in touch , " says Klinger , shaking my hand . Just as I could not look squarely at him the day I neglected to mention the impact on my conscience of his daughter 's snapshot  --  as though suppressing that fact I might bep159spared his unuttered judgment , or my own  --  so I can not let his eyes engage mine when we say farewell . But now it is because I would prefer not to give vent to my feelings of elation and indebtedness in an outburst of tears . Sniffing all sentiment back up my nose  --  and firmly , for the moment , suppressing all doubt  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " but once out on the street by myself , I repeat the incredible words aloud , only now to the accompaniment of the appropriate emotions : " I 've come through ! " The following June , when the teaching year is over for the two of us , Claire and I fly to the north of Italy , my first time back in Europe since I 'd gone prowling there with Birgitta a decade earlier . In Venice we spend five days at a quiet pensione near the Accademia . Each morning we eat breakfast in the pensione 's aromatic garden and then , in our walking shoes , weave back and forth across the bridges and alleyways that lead to the landmarksClaire has marked on the map for us to visit that day . Whenever she takes her pictures of these palazzos and piazzas and churches and fountains I wander off aways , but always looking back to get a picture of her and her unadorned beauty . Each evening after dinner under the arbor in the garden , we treat ourselves to a little gondola ride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " the softest , most luxurious , most relaxing seat in the world , " I ask myself yet again if this serenity truly exists , if this contentment , this wonderful accord is real . Is the worst over ? Have I no more terrible mistakes to make ? And no more to pay on those behind me ? Was all that only sop160much Getting Started , a longish and misguided youth out of which I have finally aged ? " Are you sure we did n't die , " I say , " and go to heaven ? " " I would n't know , " she replies ; " you 'll have to ask the gondolier . " Our last afternoon I blow us to lunch at the Gritti . On the terrace I tip the headwaiter and point to the very table where I had imagined myself sitting with the pretty studentwho used to lunch on Peanut Chews in my classroom ; I order exactly what I ate that day back in Palo Alto when we were studying Chekhov 's stories about love and I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time I am not imagining the delicious meal with the fresh , untaintedmate , this time both are real and I am well . Settlingback  --  I with a cold glass of wine ; Claire , the teetotalingdaughter of parents who overimbibed , with her acqua minerale  --  I look out across the gleaming waters of this indescribably beautiful toy town and I say to her , " Do you think Venice is really sinking ? The place seems in vaguely the same position as last time I was here . " " Who were you with then ? Your wife ? " " No . It was my Fulbright year . I was with a girl . " " Who was that ? " Now , how endangered or troubled would she feel , what , if anything , do I risk awakening if I go ahead and tell her all ? Oh , how dramatically put ! What did " all " consist of  --  any more , really , than a young sailor goes out to find in his first foreign port ? A sailor 's taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things turned out , neither a sailor 's stomach nor strength . . . Still , to someone so measured and orderly , someone who has turned all her considerable energyto making normal and ordinary what had for her been heartbreakingly irregular in her childhood home , Ip161think it best to answer , " Oh , nobody , really , " and let the matter drop . Whereupon the nobody who has been no part of my life for over ten years is all I can think of . In that Chekhov class the mismatched husband had recalled sunnier days on the terrace of the Gritti , an unbruised , audacious , young Kepesh still running around Europe scot-free ; now on the terrace of the Gritti , where I have come to celebrate the triumphant foundation of a sweet and stable new life , to celebrate the astonishing renewal of health and happiness , I am recalling the earliest , headiest hours of my sheikdom , the night in our London basement when it is my turn to ask Birgitta what it is she most wants . What I most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most wants we are leaving for last  --  she does not know . . . for in her heart , as we are to discover when the truck knocks her down , she wants none of it . But Birgitta has desires about which she is not afraid to speak , and which we proceed to satisfy . Yes , sitting across from Claire , who has said that my semen filling her mouth makes her feel that she is drowning , that this is something she just does n't care to do , I am remembering the sight of Birgitta kneeling before me , her face upturned to receive the strands of flowing semen that fall upon her hair , her forehead , her nose . " Har ! " she cries , " ha.r ! " , while Elisabeth , wearing her pink woolen robe , and reclining on the bed , looks on in frozen fascination at the naked masturbator and his half-clothed suppliant . As if such a thing matters ! As if Claire is withholding anything that matters ! But admonish myself as I will for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunatic and suicidal loss of all perspective , the rush of greedyp162lust I feel is not for this lovely young woman with whom I have only recently emerged into a life promising the most profound sort of fulfillment , but for the smallish buck-toothed comrade I last saw leaving my room at midnightsome thirty kilometers outside Rouen over ten years ago , desire for my own lewd , lost soul mate , who , back before my sense of the permissible began its inward collapse , welcomed as feverishly and gamely as did I the uncommon act and the alien thought . Oh , Birgitta , go away ! But this time we are in our room right here in Venice , a hotel on a narrow alleyway off the Zattere , not very far from the little bridge where Claire had taken my picture earlier in the day . I tie a kerchief around her eyes , careful to knot it tightly at the back , and then I am standingover the blindfolded girl and  --  ever so lightly to begin with  --  whipping her between her parted legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the bite of each stroke of my belt on her genital crease . I watch this as I have never watched anything before in my life . " Say all the things , " Birgitta whispers , and I do , in a low , subdued growl such as I have never used before to address anyone or anything . For Birgitta then  --  for what I would now prefer to dismissas a " longish and misguided youth "  --  a surging sense of lascivious kinship . . . and for Claire , for this truly passionate and loving rescuer of mine ? Anger ; disappointment ; disgust  --  contempt for all she does so marvelously , resentment over that little thing she will not deign to do . I see how very easily I could have no use for her . The snapshots . The lists . The mouth that will not drink my come . The curriculum-review committee . Everything.  |p163The  impulse to fly up from the table and telephone Dr. Klinger I suppress . I will not be one of those hysterical patients at the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eat the meal when it is served , and sure enough , by the time the dessert is to be ordered , yearnings for Birgitta begging me and Birgitta beneath me and Birgitta below me , all such yearnings have begun to subside , as left to themselves those yearnings will . And the anger disappears too , to be replaced by shame-filled sadness . If Claire senses the rising and ebbing of all this distress  --  and how can she not ? how else understand my silent , icy gloom ?  --  she decides to pretend ignorance , to talk on about her plans for the curriculum-review committee until whatever has cast us apart has simply passed away . From Venice we drive a rented car to Padua to look at the Giottos . Claire takes more pictures . She will have them developed when we get home and then , sitting cross-legged on the floor  --  the posture of tranquillity , of concentration , the posture of a very good girl indeed  --  paste them , in their proper sequence , into the album for this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the bed where her volumes of photographs are stored , now northern Italy will be forever hers , along with Schenectady , where she was born and raised , Ithaca , where she went to college , and New York City , where she lives and works and lately has fallen in love . And I will be there at the foot of the bed , along with her places , her family , and her friends . Though so many of her twenty-five years have been blighted by the squabbling of contentious parents  --  argumentsabetted , as often as not , by too many tumblers ofp164Scotch  --  she regards the past as worth recording and remembering , if only because she has outlasted the pain and disorder to establish a decent life of her own . As she likes to say , it is the only past she has got to remember , hard as it may have been when the bombs were bursting around her and she was trying her best to grow up in one piece . And then , of course , that Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the comforters of their children does not mean that their daughter must deny herself the ordinary pleasures that ordinary families ( if such there be ) take as a matter of course . To all the pleasant amenities of family life  --  the exchanging of photographs , the giving of gifts , the celebrationof holidays , the regular phone calls  --  both Claire and her older sister are passionately devoted , as though in fact she and Olivia are the thoughtful parents and their parents the callow offspring . From a hotel in a small mountain town where we find a room with a terrace and a bed and an Arcadian view , we make day trips to Verona and Vicenza . Pictures , pictures , pictures . What is the opposite of a nail being driven into a coffin ? Well , that is what I hear as Claire 's camera clicks away . Once again I feel I am being sealed up into somethingwonderful . One day we just walk with a picnic lunch up along the cowpaths and through the flowering fields , whole nations of minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can walk silently with Claire for hours on end . I am content just to lie on the ground propped up on one elbow and watch her pick wild flowers to take back to our room and arrange in a water glass to place beside my pillow . I feel no need for anythingp165more . " More " has no meaning . Nor does Birgitta appear to have meaning any longer , as though " Birgitta " and " more " are just different ways of saying the same thing . Following the performance at the Gritti , she has failed to put in anything like such a sensational appearance again . For the next few nights she does come by to pay me a visit each time Claire and I make love  --  kneeling , always kneeling , and begging for what thrills her most  --  but then she is gone , and I am above the body I am above , and with that alone partake of all the " more " I now could want , or want to want . Yes , I just hold tight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy once again the awesome fact of my great good luck . On our last afternoon , we carry our lunch to the crest of a field that looks across high green hills to the splendid white tips of the Dolomites . Claire lies stretched out beside where I am sitting , her ample figure gently swelling and subsiding with each breath she draws . Looking steadily down at this large , green-eyed girl in her thin summer clothes , at her pale , smallish , oval , unmarred face , her scrubbed , unworldly prettiness  --  the beauty , I realize , of a young Amish or Shaker woman  --  I say to myself , " Claire is enough . Yes , Claire ' and enough '  --  they , too , are one word . " From Venice we fly by way of Vienna  --  and the house of Sigmund Freud  --  to Prague . During this last year I have been teaching the Kafka course at the university  --  the paper that I am to read a few days from now in Bruges has Kafka 's preoccupations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet seen his city , other than in books of photographs . Just prior to our de/parture I had graded the final examinations written by my fifteen students in the seminar , who had read all of the fiction , Max Brod 's biography , and Kafka 's diaries and his letters to Milena and to his father . One of the questions I had asked on the examination was thisIn his " Letter to His Father " Kafka writes , " My writing is all about you ; all I did there , after all , was to bemoan what I could not bemoan upon your breast . It was an intentionally long-drawn-out leave-taking from you , yet , although it was enforced by you , it did take its course in the direction determined by me . . . " What does Kafka mean when he says to his father , " My writing is all about you , " and adds , " yet it did take its course in the direction determined by me " ? If you like , imagine yourself to be Max Brod writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining what it is your friend has in mind . . . I had been pleased by the number of students who had taken my suggestion and decided to pretend to be the writer 's friend and biographer  --  and , in describing the inner workings of a most unusual son to a most conventionalfather , had demonstrated a mature sensitivity to Kafka 's moral isolation , to his peculiarities of perspective and temperament , and to those imaginative processes by which a fantasist as entangled as Kafka was in daily existence transforms into fable his everyday struggles . Hardly a single benighted literature major straying into ingenious metaphysical exegesis ! Oh , I am pleased , all right , with the Kafka seminar and with myself for what I 've done there . But these first months with Claire , what has n't been a source of pleasure ?  |p167Before  leaving home I had been given the name and telephone number of an American spending the year teaching in Prague , and , happily , as it turns out ( and what does n't these days ? ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the afternoon free and are able to give us a tour of old Prague . From a bench in the Old Town Square we gaze across at the palatial building where Franz Kafka attended Gymnasium . To the right of the columned entryway is the ground-floor site of Hermann Kafka 's business . " He could n't even get away from him at school , " I say . " All the worse for him , " the Czech professor replies , " and all the better for the fiction . " In the imposing Gothic church nearby , high on one wall of the nave , a small square window faces an apartment next door where , I am informed , Kafka 's family had once lived . So Kafka , I say , could have sat there furtively looking down on the sinner confessing and the faithful at prayer . . . and the interior of this church , might it not have furnished , if not every last detail , at least the atmosphere for the Cathedral of The Trial ? And those steep angular streets across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must have served as inspiration for him too . . . Perhaps so , says the Czech professor , but a small castle village in northern Bohemia that Kafka knew from his visits to his grandfatheris thought to have been the principal model for the topography of The Castle . Then there is the little country village where his sister had spent a year managing a farm and where Kafka had gone to stay with her during a spell of illness . Had we time , says the Czech professor , Claire and I might benefit from an overnight visit to the country/side . " Visit one of those xenophobic little towns , with its smoky taverna and its buxom barmaid , and you will see what a thoroughgoing realist this Kafka was . " For the first time I sense something other than geniality in this smallish , bespectacled , neatly attired academic  --  I sense all that the geniality is working to suppress . Near the wall of the castle , on cobbled Alchemist Street  --  and looking like a dwelling out of a child 's bedtimestory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny house that his youngest sister had rented one winter for Kafka to live in , another of her efforts to help separate the bachelor son from father and family . The little place is now a souvenir shop . Picture postcards and Prague mementos are being sold on the spot where Kafka had meticulously scribbled variants of the same paragraph ten times over in his diary , and where he had drawn his sardonicstick figures of himself , the " private ideograms " he hid , along with practically everything else , in a drawer . Claire takes a picture of the three literature professors in front of the perfectionist writer 's torture chamber . Soon it will be in its place in one of the albums at the foot of her bed . While Claire goes off with the American professor , and her camera , for a tour of the castle grounds , I sit over tea with Professor Soska , our Czech guide . When the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia and put an end to the Prague Spring reform movement , Soska was fired from his universitypost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minuscule pension . His wife , a research scientist , also was relieved of her position for political reasons and , in order to support the family of four , has been working for a year now as a typist in a meat-packing plant . Howp169has the retired professor managed to keep up his morale , I wonder . His three-piece suit is impeccable , his gait quick , his speech snappy and precise  --  how does he do it ? What gets him up in the morning and to sleep at night ? What gets him through each day ? " Kafka , of course , " he says , showing me that smile again . " Yes , this is true ; many of us survive almost solely on Kafka . Including people in the street who have never read a word of his . They look at one another when somethinghappens , and they say , It 's Kafka . ' Meaning , That 's the way it goes here now . ' Meaning , What else did you expect ? ' " " And anger ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , It 's Kafka ' ? " " For the first six months after the Russians came to stay with us I was myself in a continuous state of agitation . I went every night to secret meetings with my friends . Every other day at least I circulated another illegal petition . And in the time remaining I wrote , in my most preciseand lucid prose , in my most elegant and thoughtful sentences , encyclopedic analyses of the situation which then circulated in samizdat among my colleagues . Then one day I keeled over and they sent me to the hospital with bleeding ulcers . I thought at first , all right , I will lie here on my back for a month , I will take my medicine and eat my slops , and then  --  well , then what ? What will I do when I stop bleeding ? Return to playing K. to their Castle and their Court ? This can all go on interminably , as Kafka and his readers so well know . Those pathetic , hopeful , striving K. 's of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their solution , feverishly traversing the city contemplating the new developmentp170that will lead to , of all things , their success . Beginnings , middles , and , most fantastical of all , endings  --  that is how they believe they can force events to unfold . " " But , Kakfa and his readers aside , will things change if there is no opposition ? " The smile , disguising God only knows the kind of expressionhe would like to show to the world . " Sir , I have made my position known . The entire country has made its position known . This way we live now is not what we had in mind . For myself , I can not burn away what remains of my digestive tract by continuing to make this clear to our authorities seven days a week . " " And so what do you do instead ? " " I translate Moby Dick into Czech . Of course , a translationhappens already to exist , a very fine one indeed . There is absolutely no need for another . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing else pressing to be accomplished , well , why not ? " " Why that book ? Why Melville ? " I ask him . " In the fifties I spent a year on an exchange program , living in New York City . Walking the streets , it looked to me as if the place was aswarm with the crew of Ahab 's ship . And at the helm of everything , big or small , I saw yet another roaring Ahab . The appetite to set things right , to emerge at the top , to be declared a champ . ' And by dint , not just of energy and will , but of enormous rage . And that , the rage , that is what I should like to translate into Czech . . . if "  --  smiling  --  " that can be translated into Czech . " Now , as you might imagine , this ambitious project , when completed , will be utterly useless for two reasons . First , there is no need for another translation , particularlyp171one likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and second , no translation of mine can be published in this country . In this way , you see , I am able to undertake what I would not otherwise have dared to do , without having to bother myself any longer worrying whether it is sensible or not . Indeed , some nights when I am working late , the futility of what I am doing would appear to be my deepest source of satisfaction . To you perhaps this may appear to be nothing but a pretentious form of capitulation , of self-mockery . It may even appear that way to me on occasion . Nonetheless , it remains the most serious thing I can think to do in my retirement . And you , " he asks , so very genially , " what draws you so to Kafka ? " " It 's a long story too . " " Dealing with ? " " Not with political hopelessness . " " I would think not . " " Rather , " I say , " in large part , with sexual despair , with vows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me behind my back , and which I lived with against my will . Either I turned against my flesh , or it turned against me  --  I still do n't know quite how to put it . " From the look of things , you do n't seem to have suppressedits urgings entirely . That is a very attractive young woman you are traveling with . " " Well , the worst is over . May be over . At least is over for now . But while it lasted , while I could n't be what I had always just assumed I was , well , it was n't quite like anything I had ever known before . Of course you are the one on intimate terms with totalitarianism  --  but if you'llp172permit me , I can only compare the body 's utter singlemindedness , its cold indifference and absolute contempt for the well-being of the spirit , to some unyielding , authoritarianregime . And you can petition it all you like , offer up the most heartfelt and dignified and logical sort of appeal  --  and get no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh is what you get . I submitted my petitions through a psychoanalyst ; went to his office every other day for an hour to make my case for the restoration of a robust libido . And , I tell you , with arguments and perorations no less involuted and tedious and cunning and abstruse than the kind of thing you find in The Castle . You think poor K. is clever  --  you should have heard me trying to outfoximpotence . " " I can imagine . That 's not a pleasant business . " " Of course , measured against what you  --  " " Please , you need n't say things like that . It is not a pleasant business , and the right to vote provides , in this matter , little in the way of compensation . " " That is true . I did vote during this period , and found it made me no happier . What I started to say about Kafka , about reading Kafka , is that stories of obstructed , thwarted K. 's banging their heads against invisible walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . It was all a little less remote , suddenly , than the Kafka I 'd read in college . In my own way , you see , I had come to know that sense of having been summoned  --  or of imagining yourself summoned  --  to a calling that turns out to be beyond you , yet in the face of every compromisingor farcical consequence , being unable to wise up and relinquish the goal . You see , I once went about living as though sex were sacred ground . "  | " So to be chaste ' . . . " he says , sympathetically . " Most unpleasant . " " I sometimes wonder if The Castle is n't in fact linked to Kafka 's own erotic blockage  --  a book engaged at every level with not reaching a climax . " He laughs at my speculation , but as before , gently and with that unrelenting amiability . Yes , just so profoundly compromised is the retired professor , caught , as in a mangle , between conscience and the regime  --  between conscience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting a hand on my arm in a kind and fatherly way , " to each obstructed citizen his own Kafka . " " And to each angry man his own Melville , " I reply . " But then what are bookish people to do with all the great prose they read  --  " "  --  but sink their teeth into it . Exactly . Into the books , instead of into the hand that throttles them . " Late that afternoon , we board the streetcar whose number Professor Soska had written in pencil on the back of a packet of postcards ceremoniously presented to Claire at the door of our hotel . The postcards are illustratedwith photographs of Kafka , his family , and Prague landmarks associated with his life and his work . The handsome little set is no longer in circulation , Soska explained to us , now that the Russians occupy Czechoslovakiaand Kafka is an outlawed writer , the outlawed writer . " But you do have another set , I hope , " said Claire , " for yourself  --  ? " " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I have Prague . Please , permit me . I am sure that everyone who meets you wants to give you a gift . " And here he suggested the visit to Kafka 's grave , to which it would not , however , be advisable for him to ac/company us . . . and motioning with his hand , he drew our attention to a man standing with his back to a parked taxicab some fifty feet up the boulevard from the door of the hotel : the plainclothesman , he informs us , who used to follow him and Mrs. Soska around in the months after the Russian invasion , back when the professor was helping to organize the clandestine opposition to the new puppet regime and his duodenum was still intact . " Are you sure that 's him , here ? " I had asked . " Sufficiently sure , " said Soska , and stooping quickly to kiss Claire 's hand , he moved with a rapid , comic stride , rather like a man in a walking race , into the crowd descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My God , " said Claire , " it 's too awful . All that terrible smiling . And that getaway ! " We are both a little stunned , not least of all , in my case , for feeling myself so safe and inviolable , what with the passport in my jacket and the young woman at my side . The streetcar carries us from the center of Prague to the outlying district where Kafka is buried . Enclosed within a high wall , the Jewish graveyard is bounded on one side by a more extensive Christian cemetery  --  through the fence we see visitors tending the graves there , kneeling and weeding like patient gardeners  --  and on the other by a wide bleak thoroughfare bearing truck traffic to and from the city . The gate to the Jewish cemetery is chained shut . I rattle the chain and call toward what seems a watchman 's house . In time a woman with a little boy appears from somewhere inside . I say in German that we have flown all the way from New York to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but saysp175no , not today . Come back Tuesday , she says . But I am a professor of literature and a Jew , I explain , and pass a handful of crowns across to her between the bars . A key appears , the gate is opened , and inside the little boy is assigned to accompany us as we follow the sign that points the way . The sign is in five different tongues  --  so many peoples fascinated by the fearful inventions of this tormented ascetic , so many fearful millions : Khrobu/ IC MorRne/Zum Grabe/To the Grave of/a la tombe de/ FRANZE KAFKY . Of all things , marking Kafka 's remains  --  and unlike anything else in sight  --  a stout , elongated , whitish rock , tapering upward to its pointed glans , a tombstone phallus . That is the first surprise . The second is that the familyhauntedson is buried forever  --  still !  --  between the mother and the father who outlived him . I take a pebble from the gravel walk and place it on one of the little mounds of pebbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never done so much for my own grandparents , buried with ten thousand others alongside an expressway twenty minutes from my New York apartment , nor have I made such a visit to my mother 's tree-shaded Catskill grave site since I accompanied my father to the unveiling of her stone . The dark rectangular slabs beyond Kafka 's grave bear familiar Jewish names . I might be thumbing through my own address book , or at the front desk looking over my mother 's shoulder at the roster of registered guests at the Hungarian Royale : Levy , Goldschmidt , Schneider , Hirsch . . . The graves go on and on , but only Kafka 's appears to be properly looked after . The other dead are without survivors hereabouts to chop away the undergrowth and to cut back the ivy that twists throughp176the limbs of the trees and forms a heavy canopy joining the plot of one extinct Jew to the next . Only the childless bachelor appears to have living progeny . Where better for irony to abound than a la tombe de Franze Kafky ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone inscribedwith the name of his great friend Brod . Here too I place a small pebble . Then for the first time I notice the plaques affixed to the length of cemetery wall , inscribed to the memory of Jewish citizens of Prague exterminated in Terezin , Auschwitz , Belsen , and Dachau . There are not pebbles enough to go around . With the silent child trailing behind , Claire and I head back to the gate . When we get there Claire snaps a picture of the shy little boy and , using sign language , instructs him to write down his name and address on a piece of paper . Pantomiming with broad gestures and stagy facial expressions that make me wonder suddenly just how childish a young woman she is  --  just how childlike and needy a man I have become  --  she is able to inform the little boy that when the photograph is ready she will send a copy to him . In two or three weeks Professor Soska is also to receive a photograph from Claire , this one taken earlier in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter . Now why do I want to call what joins me to her childish ? Why do I want to call this happiness names ? Let it happen ! Let it be ! Stop the challenging before it even starts ! You need what you need ! Make peace with it ! The woman has come from the house to open the gate . Again we exchange some remarks in German . " There are many visitors to Kafka 's grave ? " I ask . " Not so many . But always distinguished people , Pro/fessor , like yourself . Or serious young students . He was a very great man . We had many great Jewish writers in Prague . Franz Werfel . Max Brod . Oskar Baum . Franz Kafka . But now , " she says , casting her first glance , and a sidelong , abbreviated one at that , toward my companion , " they are all gone . " " Maybe your little boy will grow up to be a great Jewish writer . " She repeats my words in Czech . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down at his shoes . " He wants to be an aviator . " " Tell him people do n't always come from all over the world to visit an aviator 's grave . " Again words are exchanged with the boy , and , smiling pleasantly at me  --  yes , it is only to the Jewish professor that she will address herself with a gracious smile  --  she says , " He does n't mind that so much . And , sir , what is the name of your university ? " I tell her . " If you would like , I will take you to the grave of the man who was Dr. Kafka 's barber . He is buried here too . " " Thank you , that is very kind . " " He was also the barber of Dr. Kafka 's father . " I explain to Claire what the woman has offered . Claire says , " If you want , go ahead . " " Better not to , " I say . " Start with Kafka 's barber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his candlestickmaker . " To the graveyard attendant I say , " I 'm afraid that 's not possible right now . " " Of course your wife may come too , " she starchily informsme.  | " Thank you . But we have to get back to our hotel . " Now she looks me over with undisguised suspiciousness , as though it well may be that I am not from a distinguishedAmerican university at all . She has gone out of her way to unlock the gate on a day other than the one prescribed for tourists , and I have turned out to be less than serious , probably nothing but a curiosity seeker , a Jew perhaps , but in the company of a woman quite clearly Aryan . At the streetcar stop I say to Claire , " Do you know what Kafka said to the man he shared an office with at the insurance company ? At lunchtime he saw the fellow eating his sausage and Kafka is supposed to have shuddered and said , The only fit food for a man is half a lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Poor dope , " finding in the great writer 's dietary injunction a disdain for harmless appetites that is just plain silly to a healthy girl from Schenectady , New York . That is all  --  yet , when we board the streetcar and sit down beside each other , I take her hand and feel suddenlypurged of yet another ghost , as de-Kafkafied by my pilgrimage to the cemetery as I would appear to have been de-Birgittized once and for all by that visitation on the terrace restaurant in Venice . My obstructed days are behind me  --  along with the unobstructed ones : no more " more , " and no more nothing , either ! " Oh , Clarissa , " I say , bringing her hand to my lips , " it 's as though the past ca n't do me any more harm . I just do n't have any more regrets . And my fears are gone , too . And it 's all from finding you . I 'd thought the god of women , who doles them out to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the hell with him . ' And then he sends me Claire . " That evening , after dinner in our hotel , we go up to the room to prepare for our early departure the next day . While I pack a suitcase with my clothes and with the books I have been reading on the airplanes and in bed at night , Claire falls asleep amid the clothing she has laid out on the comforter . Aside from the Kafka diaries and Brod 's biography  --  my supplemental guidebooks to old Prague  --  I have with me paperbacks by Mishima , Gombrowicz , and Genet , novels for next year 's comparative literature class . I have decided to organize the first semester'sreading around the subject of erotic desire , beginning with these disquieting contemporary novels dealing with prurient and iniquitous sexuality ( disquieting to students because they are the sort of books admired most by a reader like Baumgarten , novels in which the author is himself pointedly implicated in what is morally most alarming ) and ending the term 's work with three masterworksconcerned with illicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means : Madame Bovary , Anna Karenina , and " Death in Venice . " Without awakening her , I pick Claire 's clothes off the bed and pack them in her suitcase . Handling her things , I feel overwhelmingly in love . Then I leave her a note saying that I have gone for a walk and will be back in an hour . Passing through the lobby I notice that there are now some fifteen or twenty pretty young prostitutes seated singly , and in pairs , beyond the glass doorway of the hotel 's spacious cafe . Earlier in the day there had been just three of them , at a single table , gaily chatting to/gether . When I asked Professor Soska how all this is organizedunder socialism , he had explained that most of Prague 's whores are secretaries and shopgirls moonlightingwith tacit government approval ; a few are employed full-time by the Ministry of the Interior to get what information they can out of the various delegations from East and West that pass through the big hotels . The covey of miniskirted girls I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Bulgarian trade mission who occupy most of the floor beneath ours . One of them , who is stroking the belly of a brown dachshund puppy that lies cuddled in her arms , smiles my way . I smile back ( costs nothing ) and then am off to the Old Town Square , where Kafka and Brod used to take their evening stroll . When I get there it is after nine and the spacious melancholyplaza is empty of everything except the shadows of the aged facades enclosing it . Where the tourist buses had been parked earlier in the day there is now only the smooth , worn , cobblestone basin . The place is empty  --  of all , that is , except mystery and enigma . I sit alone on a bench beneath a street lamp and , through the thin film of mist , look past the looming figure of Jan Hus to the church whose most sequestered proceedings the Jewishauthor could observe by peering through his secret aperture . It is here that I begin to compose in my head what at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whimsy , the first lines of an introductory lecture to my comparative literatureclass inspired by Kafka 's " Report to an Academy , " the story in which an ape addresses a scientific gathering . It is only a little story of a few thousand words , but onep181that I love , particularly its opening , which seems to me one of the most enchanting and startling in literature : " Honored Members of the Academy ! You have done me the honor of inviting me to give your Academy an account of the life I formerly led as an ape . " " Honored Members of Literature 341 , " I begin . . . but by the time I am back at the hotel and have seated myself , with pen in hand , at an empty table in a corner of the cafe , I have penetrated the veneer of donnish satire with which I began , and on hotel stationery am writing out in longhand a formal introductory lecture ( not uninfluencedby the ape 's impeccable , professorial prose ) that I want with all my heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very moment ! Seated two tables away is the prostitute with the little dachshund ; she has been joined by a friend , whose favoritepet seems to be her own hair . She strokes away at it as though it is somebody else 's . Looking up from my work , I tell the waiter to bring a cognac to each of these petite and pretty working girls , neither of them as old as Claire , and order a cognac for myself . " Cheers , " says the prostitute pleasing her puppy , and after the three of us smile at one another for a brief , enticingmoment , I go back to writing what seem to me then and there somehow to be sentences of the most enormous consequence for my happy new life . Rather than spend the first day of class talking about the reading list and the general idea behind this course , I would like to tell you some things about myself that I have never before divulged to any of my students . I have no business doing this , and until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sure I would go through with it . And I may change my mind yet . For how do I justify disclosing to you the most intimatefacts of my personal life ? True , we will be meeting to discuss books for three hours a week during the coming two semesters , and from experience I know , as you do , that under such conditions a strong bond of affection can develop . However , we also know that this does not give me license to indulge what may only be so much impertinence and bad taste . As you may already have surmised  --  by my style of dress , as easily as from the style of my opening remarks  --  the conventions traditionally governing the relationship between student and teacher are more or less those by which I have always operated , even during the turbulence of recent years . I have been told that I am one of the few remaining professorswho address students in the classroom as " Mr. " and " Miss , " rather than by their given names . And however you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage mechanic , panhandler , tearoom gypsy , or cattle rustler  --  I still prefer to appear before you to teach wearing a jacket and a tie . . . though , as the observant will record , generallyit will be the same jacket and the same tie . And when women students come to my office to confer , they will see , if they should even bother to look , that throughout the meeting I will dutifully leave open to the outside corridor the door to the room where we sit side by side . Some of you may be furtheramused when I remove my watch from my wrist , as I did only a moment ago , and place it beside my notes at the beginning of each class session . By now I no longer rememberwhich of my own professors used to keep careful track of the passing hour in this way , but it would seem to have made its impression on me , signaling a professionalism with which I like still to associate myself . All of which is not to say that I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am flesh and blood  --  or that I understand that you are . By the end of the year you may even havep183grown a little weary of my insistence upon the connections between the novels you read for this class , even the most eccentricand off-putting of novels , and what you know so far of life . You will discover ( and not all will approve ) that I do not hold with certain of my colleagues who tell us that literature , in its most valuable and intriguing moments , is " **28;4174;TOOLONG . " I may come before you in my jacket and my tie , I may address you as madam and sir , but I am going to request nonetheless that you restrain yourselvesfrom talking about " structure , " " form , " and " symbols " in my presence . It seems to me that many of you have been intimidated sufficiently by your junior year of college and should be allowed to recover and restore to respectability those interests and enthusiasms that more than likely drew you to reading fiction to begin with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an experiment you might even want during the course of this year to try living without any classroom terminology at all , to relinquish " plot " and " character " right along with those very exalted words with which not a few of you like to solemnize your observations , such as " epiphany , " " persona , " and , of course , " existential " as a modifier of everything existing under the sun . I suggest this in the hope that if you talk about Madame Bovary in more or less the same tongue you use with the grocer , or your lover , you may be placed in a more intimate , a more interesting , in what might even be called a more referential relationship with Flaubert and his heroine . In fact , one reason the novels to be read during the first semester are all concerned , to a greater or lesser degree of obsessiveness , with erotic desire is that I thought that readingsorganized around a subject with which you all have some sort of familiarity might help you even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and further to discouragethe temptation to consign them to that manageable netherworld of narrative devices , metaphorical motifs , and mythical archetypes . Above all , I hope that by reading thesep184books you will come to learn something of value about life in one of its most puzzling and maddening aspects . I hope to learn something myself . All right . This much said by way of stalling , the time has come to begin to disclose the undisclosable  --  the story of the professor 's desire . Only I ca n't , not quite yet , not until I have explained to my own satisfaction , if not to your parents ' , why I would even think to cast you as my voyeurs and my jurors and my confidants , why I would expose my secrets to people half my age , almost all of whom I have never previously known even as students . Why for me an audience , when most men and women prefer either to keep such matters entirely to themselves or to reveal them only to their most trusted confessors , secular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all appropriate , that I present myself to you young strangers in the guise not of your teacher but as the first of this semester 's texts ? Permit me to reply with an appeal to the heart . I love teaching literature . I am rarely ever so contented as when I am here with my pages of notes , and my marked-up texts , and with people like yourselves . To my mind there is nothing quite like the classroom in all of life . Sometimes when we are in the midst of talking  --  when one of you , say , has pierced with a single phrase right to the heart of the book at hand  --  I want to cry out , " Dear friends , cherish this ! " Why ? Because once you have left here people are rarely , if ever , going to talk to you or listen to you the way you talk and listen to one another and to me in this bright and barren little room . Nor is it likely that you will easily find opportunitieselsewhere to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attuned to life 's struggles as were Tolstoy , Mann , and Flaubert . I doubt that you know how very affecting it is to hear you speak thoughtfully and in all earnestness about solitude , illness , longing , loss , suffering , delusion , hope , passion , love , terror , corruption , calamity , and death . . . moving because you are nineteen and twenty years old , from comfortable middle-class homes most of you ,  |p185and  without much debilitating experience in your dossiers yet  --  but also because , oddly and sadly , this may be the last occasion you will ever have to reflect in any sustained and serious way upon the unrelenting forces with which in time you will all contend , like it or not . Have I made any clearer why I should find our classroom to be , in fact , the most suitable setting for me to make an accounting of my erotic history ? Does what I have just said render any more legitimate the claim I should like to make upon your time and patience and tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a church is to the true believer , a classroom is to me . Some kneel at Sunday prayer , others don phylacteries each dawn . . . and I appear three times each week , my tie around my neck and my watch on my desk , to teach the great stories to you . Class , oh , students , I have been riding the swell of a very large emotion this year . I 'll get to that too . In the meantime , if possible , bear with my mood of capaciousness . Really , I only wish to present you with my credentials for teaching Literature 341 . Indiscreet , unprofessional , unsavory as portionsof these disclosures will surely strike some of you , I nonetheless would like , with your permission , to go ahead now and give an open account to you of the life I formerly led as a human being . I am devoted to fiction , and I assure you that in time I will tell you whatever I may know about it , but in truth nothing lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still unattended , still sitting across from me in their white angora sweaters , pastel miniskirts , dark net stockings , and elevating highheelshoes  --  rather like children who have ransacked Mamma 's closet to dress as usherettes for a pornographic movie house  --  when I rise with my sheaf of stationery to leave the cafe . " A letter to your wife ? " says the one who strokes the dog and speaks some English.  |p186I  can not resist the slow curve she has thrown me . " To the children , " I say . She nods to the friend who is stroking her hair : yes , they know my type . At eighteen they know all the types . Her friend says something in Czech and they have a good laugh . " Goodbye , sir ; nighty-night , " says the knowing one , offeringa harmless enough smirk for me to carry away from the encounter . I am thought to have gotten my kick by buying two whores a drink . Maybe I did . Fair enough . In our room I find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the blankets . A note for me on the pillow : " Dear One  --  I loved you so much today . I will make you happy . C. " Oh , I have come through  --  on my pillow is the proof ! And the sentences in my hands ? They hardly seem now to be so laden with implication for my future as they did when I was hurrying back to the hotel from the Old Town Square , dying to get my hands on a piece of paper so as to make my report to my academy . Folding the pages in two , I put them with the paperbacks at the bottom of my suitcase , there along with Claire 's note that promises to make her dear one happy . I feel absolutely triumphant : capacious indeed . When I am awakened in the early morning by a door slamming beneath our room  --  down where the Bulgariansare sleeping , one of them no doubt with a little Czech whore and a dachshund puppy  --  I find I can not begin to reconstruct the meandering maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I had expected I would sleep marvelously , yet I awakenp187perspiring and , for those first timeless seconds , with no sense at all of where I am in bed or with whom . Then , blessedly , I find Claire , a big warm animal of my own species , my very own mate of the other gender , and encirclingher with my arms  --  drawing her sheer creaturelinessup against the length of my body  --  I begin to recall the long , abusive episode that had unfolded more or less along these lines : I am met at the train by a Czech guide . He is called X , " as in the alphabet , " he explains . I am sure he is really Herbie Bratasky , our master of ceremonies , but I do nothing to tip my hand . " And what have you seen so far ? " asks X as I disembark . " Why , nothing . I am just arriving . " " Then I have just the thing to start you off . How would you like to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such a person ? And she is still alive ? " " How would you like to be taken to talk with her ? " I speak only after I have looked to be sure that no oneis eavesdropping . " It is everything I ever hoped for . " " And how was Venice without the Swede ? " X asks aswe step aboard the cemetery streetcar . " Dead . " The apartment is four flights up , in a decrepit building by the river . The woman we have come to see is nearly eighty : arthritic hands , slack jowls , white hair , clear and sweet blue eyes . Lives in a rocking chair on the pension of her late husband , an anarchist . I ask myself , " An anarchist 's widow receiving a government pension ? " " Was he an anarchist all his life ? " I ask . " From the time he was twelve , " X replies . " That wasp188when his father died . He once explained to me how it happened . He saw his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who smiles at me and loves me is no more . Never again will any man smile at me and love me as he did . Wherever I go I will be a stranger and an enemy all my life . ' That 's how anarchists are made , apparently . I take it you are not an anarchist . " " No . My father and I love each other to this day . I believe in the rule of law . " From the window of the apartment I can see the gliding force of the famous Moldau . " Why , there , boys and girls , at the edge of the river "  --  I am addressing my class  --  " is the piscine where Kafka and Brod would go swimmingtogether . See , it is as I told you : Franz Kafka was real , Brod was not making him up . And so am I real , nobodyis making me up , other than myself . " X and the old woman converse in Czech . X says to me , " I told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Kafka . You can ask her whatever you want . " " What did she make of him ? " I ask . " How old was he when she knew him ? How old was she ? When exactly was all this taking place ? " X ( interpreting ) : " She says , He came to me and I took a look at him and I thought , " What is this Jewish boy so depressed about ? " ' She thinks it was in 1916 . She says she was twenty-five . Kafka was in his thirties . " " Thirty-three , " I say . " Born , class , in 1883 . And as we know from all our years of schooling , three from six is three , eight from one does n't go , so we must borrow one from the preceding digit ; eight from eleven is three ,  |p189eight  from eight is zero , and one from one is zero  --  and that is why thirty-three is the correct answer to the question : How old was Kafka when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What , if any , is the relationshipbetween Kafka 's whore and today 's story , The Hunger Artist ' ? " X says , " And what else would you like to know ? " " Was he regularly able to have an erection ? Could he usually reach orgasm ? I find the diaries inconclusive . " Her eyes are expressive when she answers , though the crippled hands lie inert in her lap . In the midst of the indecipherableCzech I catch a word that makes my flesh run : Franz ! X nods gravely . " She says that was no problem . She knew what to do with a boy like him . " Shall I ask ? Why not ? I have come not just from America , after all , but out of oblivion , to which I shall shortly return . " What was that ? " Matter-of-fact still , she tells X what she did to arouse the author of  --  " Name Kafka 's major works in the order of their composition . Grades will be posted on the departmentbulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies will please line up outside my office to be whipped to within an inch of their lives . " X says , " She wants money . American money , not crowns . Give her ten dollars . " I give over the money . What use will it be in oblivion ? " No , that will not be on the final . " X waits until she is finished , then translates : " She blew him . " Probably for less than it cost me to find out . There isp190such a thing as oblivion , and there is such a thing as fraud , which I am also against . Of course ! This woman is nobody , and Bratasky gets half . " And what did Kafka talk about ? " I ask , and yawn to show just how seriously I now take these proceedings . X translates the old woman 's reply word for word : " I do n't remember any more . I did n't remember the next day probably . Look , these Jewish boys would sometimes say nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll tell you one thing , though  --  they never hit me . And they were clean boys . Clean underwear . Clean collars . They would never dream to come here with so much as a soiled handkerchief . Of course everybody I always would wash with a rag . I was always hygienic . But they did n't even need it . They were clean and they were gentlemen . As God is my witness , they never beat on my backside . Even in bed they had manners . " " But is there anything about Kafka in particular that she remembers ? I did n't come here , to her , to Prague , to talk about nice Jewish boys . " She gives some thought to the question ; or , more likely , no thought . Just sits there trying out being dead . " You see , he was n't so special , " she finally says . " I do n't mean he was n't a gentleman . They were all gentlemen . " I say to Herbie ( refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , " Well , I do n't really know what to ask next , Herb . I have the feeling she may have Kafka confused with somebody else . " " The woman 's mind is razor-sharp , " Herbie replies . " Still , she 's not exactly Brod on the subject . " The aged whore , sensing perhaps that I have had it , speaks again.  |p191Herbie  says , " She wants to know if you would like to inspect her pussy . " " To what possible end ? " I reply . " Shall I inquire ? " " Oh , please do . " Eva ( for this , Herbie claims , is the lady 's name ) repliesat length . " She submits that it might hold some literary interest for you . Others like yourself , who have come to her because of her relationship with Kafka , have been most anxious to see it , and , providing of course that their credentials established them as serious , she has been willing to show it to them . She says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted to allow you to have a quick look . " " I thought she only blew him . Really , Herb , of what possibleinterest could her pussy be to me ? You know I am not in Prague alone . " Translation : " Again , she frankly admits she does n't know of what interest anything about her is to anyone . She says she is grateful for the little money she is able to make from her friendship with young Franz , and she is flattered that her callers are themselves distinguished and learned men . Of course , if the gentleman does not care to examine it  --  " But why not ? Why come to the battered heart of Europeif not to examine just this ? Why come into the world at all ? " Students of literature , you must conquer your squeamishness once and for all ! You must face the unseemlything itself ! You must come off your high horse ! There , there is your final exam . " It would cost me five more American dollars . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say.  | " First of all , given your field of interest , the money is tax-deductible . Second , for only a fiver , you are striking a decisive blow against the Bolsheviks . She is one of the last in Prague still in business for herself . Third , you are helping preserve a national literary monument  --  you are doing a service for our suffering writers . And last but not least , think of the money you have given to Klinger . What 's five more to the cause ? " " I beg your pardon . What cause ? " " Your happiness . We only want to make you happy , to make you finally you , David dear . You have denied yourselftoo much as it is . " Despite her arthritic hands Eva is able on her own to tug her dress up until it is bunched in her lap . Herbie , however , has to hold her around with one arm , shift her on her buttocks , and draw down her underpants for her . I reluctantly help by steadying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shanks , and , astonishingly , a triangular black patch , pasted on like a mustache . I find myself rather doubting the authenticity of the pubic hair . " She would like to know , " says Herbie , " if the gentleman would care to touch it . " " And how much does that go for ? " Herbie repeats my question in Czech . Then to me , with a courtly bow , " Her treat . " " Thanks , no . " But again she assures the gentleman that it will costhim nothing . Again the gentleman courteously declines . Now Eva smiles  --  between her parted lips , her tongue , still red . The pulp of the fruit , still red ! " Herb , what did she say just then ? "  | " Do n't think I ought to repeat it , not to you . " " What was it , Herbie ? I demand to know ! " " Something indecent , " he says , chuckling , " about what Kafka liked the most . His big thrill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think your dad would want you to hear that , Dave . Or your dad 's dad , and so on , all the way back to the Father of the Faithful and the Friend of God . Besides , it may just have been a malicious remark , gratuitouslymade , with no foundation in fact . She may only have said it because you insulted her . You see , by refusing to touch a finger to her famous vizz you have cast doubt  --  perhaps not entirely inadvertently either  --  on the very meaning of her life . Moreover , she is afraid you will go back to America now and tell your colleagues that she is a fraud . And then serious scholars will no longer come to pay their respects  --  which , of course , would mark the end for her , and if I may say so , the end too for private enterprise in our country . It would constitute nothing less than the final victory of the Bolsheviks over free men . " " Well , except for this new Czech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could have fooled just about anybodybut me  --  you have n't changed , Bratasky , not a bit . " " Too bad I ca n't say the same about you . " Here Herbie approaches the old woman , her face now sadly tear-streaked , and cupping his fingers as though to catch the trickle of a stream , he places his hands betweenher bare legs . " Coo , " she gurgles . " Coo . Coo . " And closing her blue eyes , she rubs her cheek against Herbie 's shoulder . The tip of her tongue I see protruding from her mouth . The pulp of the fruit , still red.  |p195U|pon  returning from our travels through the beautifulcities  --  after I dreamed in Prague of visiting Kafka 's whore , we flew the next morning to Paris , and three days later to Bruges , where at a conference on modern Europeanliterature I read the paper entitled " Hunger Art "  --  we decide to split the rent on a small house in the country for July and August . How better to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I can think about is the time I last lived in daily proximity to a woman , the tomb-like months just before the Hong Kong fiasco , when neither of us could so much as bear the sight of the other 's shoes on the floor of the closet . Consequently , before I sign the lease for the perfect little house that we 've found , I suggest that probably it would be best not to sublet either of our apartments in the city for the two months  --  a small financial sacrifice , true , but this way there will always be a place to retreat to if anything untoward should happen . I actually say " untoward . " Claire  --  prudent , patient , tender Claire  --  understands well enough what I mean as I jabber on in this vein , the pen in my hand , and thep196agent who drew up the lease casting unamused glances from the other end of his office . Raised by heavyweight battlers from the day she was born until she was able to leave for school and a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of seventeen , she has no argument against having a nest to fly off to , as well as the nest that is to be shared , for so long as the sharing is good . No , we wo n't rent our apartments , she agrees . Whereupon , with the solemnity of the Japanese **25;4204;TOOLONG down aboard MacArthur 's battleshipto surrender an empire , I affix my signature to the lease . A small , two-storied white clapboard farmhouse , then , set halfway up a hillside of dandelions and daisies from a silent , untraveled rural road , and twenty miles north of the Catskill village where I was raised . I have chosen Sullivan County over Cape Cod , and that too is fine with Claire  --  proximity to the Vineyard and to Olivia seems not to matter to her quite the way it did just the year before . And for me the gentle green hills and distant green mountains beyond the dormer windows take me back to the bedroom vista of my childhood  --  exactly my view from the room at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already have with her that I am living at last in accordance with my true spirit , that , indeed , I am " home . " And for the spirit what a summer it is ! From the daily regimen of swimming in the morning and hiking in the afternoon we each grow more and more fit , while within , day by day , we grow fat as our farmer neighbor 's hogs . How the spirit feasts on just getting up in the morning ! on coming to in a whitewashed sunlit room with my arms en/circling her large , substantial form . Oh , how I do love the size of her in bed ! That tangibility of hers ! And the weight of those breasts in my hands ! Oh , very different , this , from all the months and months of waking up with nothing to hold on to but my pillow ! Later  --  is it not yet eleven ? really ? we have eaten our cinnamon toast , taken our dip , stopped in town to buy food for dinner , brooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ten-fifteen ?  --  later , from the rocker on the porch where I do my morning writing , I watch her toil in the garden . Two spiral notebooks are arranged beside me . In one I work at planning the projected book on Kafka , to be called , after my Bruges lecture , Hunger Art , while in the other , whose pages I approach with far greater eagerness  --  andwhere I am having somewhat more success  --  I move on to the substance of the lecture whose prologue I had begun composing in the hotel cafe in Prague , the story of my life in its most puzzling and maddening aspects , my chronicle of the iniquitous , the ungovernable and the thrilling . . . or ( by way of a working title ) , " How David Kepesh comes to be sitting in a wicker rocker on a screened-in porch in the Catskill Mountains , watching with contentment while a teetotaling twenty-five-year-old sixth-grade teacher from Schenectady , New York , creeps about her flower garden in what appear to be overalls handed down from Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of green twister seal cut from the coil with which she stakes the swooning begonias , her delicate , innocent Mennonite face , small and intelligent as a raccoon 's , and soil-smudged as though in preparation for Indian night at the Girl Scout jamboree  --  and his happinessin her hands . "  | " Why do n't you come out and help with the weeds ? " she calls  --  " Tolstoy would have . " " He was a big-time novelist , " I say ; " they have to do that sort of thing , to gain Experience . Not me . For me it 's enough to see you crawling on your knees . " " Well , whatever pleases , " she says . Ah , Clarissa , let me tell you , all that is pleases . The pond where we swim . Our apple orchard . The thunderstorms . The barbecue . The music playing . Talking in bed . Your grandmother 's iced tea . Deliberating on which walk to take in the morning and which at dusk . Watching you lower your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , nothing , really , is what pleases . But what nothing ! Nations go to war for this kind of nothing , and in the absence of such nothing , people shrivel up and die . Of course by now the passion between us is no longer quite what it was on those Sundays when we would cling together in my bed until three in the afternoon  --  " the primrose path to madness , " as Claire once described those rapacious exertions which end finally with the two of us rising on the legs of weary travelers to change the bed linens , to stand embracing beneath the shower , and then to go out of doors to get some air before the winter sun goes down . That , once begun , our lovemaking should have continued with undiminished intensity for almost a year  --  that two industrious , responsible , idealistic schoolteachers should have adhered to one another like dumb sea creatures , and , at the moment of overbrimming , have come to the very brink of tearing flesh with cannibalizedjaws  --  well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself , having already served beyond the call of duty  --  having already stakedp199so much and lost so much  --  under the tattered scarlet standard of His Royal Highness , my lust . Leveling off . Overheated frenzy subsiding into quiet physical affection . That is how I choose to describe what is happening to our passion during this blissful summer . Can I think otherwise  --  can I possibly believe that , rather than coming to rest on some warm plateau of sweet cozinessand intimacy , I am being eased down a precipitous incline and as yet am nowhere near the cold and lonely cavern where I finally will touch down ? To be sure , the faintly brutal element has taken it on the lam ; gone is the admixture of the merciless with the tender , those intimationsof utter subjugation that one sees in the purplish bruise , the wantonness one thrills to in the coarse word breathed at the peak of pleasure . We no longer succumb to desire , nor do we touch each other everywhere , paw and knead and handle with that unquenchable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . True , I am no longer a little bit of a beast , she is no longer a little bit of a tramp , neither any longer is quite the greedy lunatic , the depraved child , the steely violator , the helplessly impaled . Teeth , once blades and pincers , the pain-inflicting teeth of little cats and dogs , are simply teeth again , and tongues are tongues , and limbs are limbs . Which is , as we all know , how it must be . And I for one will not quarrel , or sulk , or yearn , or despair . I will not make a religion of what is fading away  --  of my craving for that bowl into which I dip my face as though to extract the last dram of a syrup I can not guzzle down fast enough . . . of the harsh excitement of that pumping grip so strong , so rapid , so unyielding ,  |p200that  if I do not moan that there is nothing left of me , that I am stupefied and numb , she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , continue until she has milked the very life from my body . I will not make a religion of the marvelous sight of her half-stripped . No , I intend to nurse no illusions about the chance for a great revival of the drama we would seem very nearly to have played out , this clandestine , uncensored , underground theater of four furtive selves  --  the two who pant in performance , the two who pantingly watch  --  wherein regardfor the hygienic , the temperate , and the time of day or night is all so much ridiculous intrusion . I tell you , I am a new man  --  that is , I am a new man no longer  --  and I know when my number is up : now just stroking the soft , long hair will do , just resting side by side in our bed each morning will do , awakening folded together , mated , in love . Yes , I am willing to settle on these terms . This will suffice . No more more . And before whom am I on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide how far from Claire I am going to slide ? Honored members of Literature 341 , you would think , as I do , that it would , it should , it must , be me . Late in the afternoon of one of the loveliest days of August , with nearly fifty such days already stored away in memory and the deep contentment of knowing that there are still a couple dozen more to come , on an afternoon when my feeling of well-being is boundless and I can not imagine anyone happier or luckier than myself , I receive a visit from my former wife . I will think about itp201for days afterward , imagining each time the phone rings or I hear the sound of a car turning up the steep drive to the house that it is Helen returning . I will expect to find a letter from her every morning , or rather a letter about her , informing me that she has run off again to Hong Kong , or that she is dead . When I awaken in the middle of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  and this still happens to me , too regularly  --  I will cling to my sleeping partner as though it is she who is ten years my senior  --  twenty , thirty years my senior  --  rather than the other way around . I am out by the orchard in a canvas lounge chair , my legs in the sun and my head in the shade , when I hear the phone ringing inside the house , where Claire is getting ready to go swimming . I have not yet decided  --  of such decisions are my days composed  --  whether I 'll go along with her to the pond , or just stay on quietly doing my work until it is time to water the marigolds and open the wine . Since lunch I have been out here  --  just myself , the bumblebees , and the butterflies , and , from time to time , Claire 's old Labrador , Dazzle  --  reading Colette and taking notes for the course known by now around the house as Desire 341 . Leafing through a pile of her books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America a novelist with a point of view toward the taking and giving of pleasure even vaguely resembling Colette 's , an Americanwriter , man or woman , stirred as deeply as she is by scent and warmth and color , someone as sympathetic to the range of the body 's urgings , as attuned to the world 's every sensuous offering , a connoisseur of the finest gradationsof amorous feeling , who is nonetheless immune top202fanaticism of any sort , except , as with Colette , a fanatical devotion to the self 's honorable survival . Hers seems to have been a nature exquisitely susceptible to all that desirelongs for and promises  --  " these pleasures which are lightly called physical "  --  yet wholly untainted by puritan conscience , or murderous impulse , or megalomania , or sinister ambitions , or the score-settling rage of class or social grievance . One thinks of her as egotistic , in the sharpest , crispest sense of the word , the most pragmatic of sensualists , her capacity for protective self-scrutiny in perfect balance with the capacity to be carried awayThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragmentary beginnings of a lecture outline  --  running down one margin is a long list of modern novelists , European as well as American , among whom Colette 's decent , robust , bourgeois paganism still seems to me unique  --  when Claire comes out of the kitchen 's screen door , wearing her bathing suit and carryingher white terry-cloth robe over her arm . The book in her hand is Musil 's Young Torless , the copy I 'd just finished marking up the night before . How delighted I am with her curiosity about these books I will be teaching ! And to look up at the swell of her breasts above the bikini 's halter , well , that is yet another of this wonderful day 's satisfactions . " Tell me , " I say , taking hold of the calf of her nearest leg , " why is there no American Colette ? Or could it be Updike who comes the closest ? It 's surely not Henry Miller . It 's surely not Hawthorne . " " A phone call for you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " I look at my watch , for all the help thatp203will give . " What time would it be in California ? What can she want ? How did she find me ? " " It 's a local call . " " Is it ? " " I think so , yes . " I have n't yet moved from the chair . " And that 's what she said , Helen Kepesh ? " " Yes . " " But I thought she 'd taken her own name back . " Claire shrugs . " You told her I was here ? " " Do you want me to tell her you are n't ? " " What can she want ? " " You 'll have to ask her , " says Claire . " Or maybe you wo n't . " " Would it be so very wrong of me just to go in there and put the phone back on the hook ? " " Not wrong , " says Claire . " Only unduly anxious . " " But I feel unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . " I spread ten fingers across the soft swellof flesh above her halter . " Oh , my dear , dear pal . " " I 'll wait out here , " she says . " And I will go swimming with you . " " Okay . Good . " " So wait ! " It would be neither cruel nor cowardly , I tell myself , looking down at the phone on the kitchen table  --  it would just be the most sensible thing I could do . Except , of the half-dozen people closest to my life , Helen happens still to be one . " Hello , " I say . " Hello . Oh , hello . Look , I feel odd about phoning you ,  |p204David  . I almost did n't . Except I seem to be in your town . We 're at the Texaco station ; across from a real-estate office . " " I see . " " I 'm afraid it was just too hard driving off without even calling . How are you ? " " How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried you in New York a few days ago . I called the college , and the department secretary said she was n't authorizedto give out your summer address . I said I was a former student and I was sure you would n't mind .

" " My , my " " But stopping off here for gas is really just accidental . Strange , I know , but true . And not as strange , after all , as the truly strange things that happen . " She is lying and I 'm not charmed . Through the window I can see Claire holding the unopened book in her hand . We could already be in the car on the way down to the pond . " What do you want , Helen ? " " You mean from you ? Nothing ; nothing at all . I 'm married now . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in New York . We were visiting my husband 's family . We 're on our way to Vermont . They have a summer house there . " She laughs ; a very appealing laugh . It makes me remember her in bed . " Can you believe I 've never been to New England ? "  | " Well , " I say , " it 's not exactly Rangoon . " " Neither is Rangoon any more . " " How is your health ? I heard that you were pretty sick . " " I 'm better now . I had a hard time for a while . But it 's over . How are you ? " " My hard time is over too . " " I 'd like to see you , if I could . Are we that far from your house ? I 'd like to talk to you , just for a little  --  " " About what ? " " I owe you some explanations . " " You do n't . No more than I owe you any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late date without the explana-tions . " " I was mad , David , I was going crazy  --  David , these are difficult things to say surrounded by cans of motor oil . " " Then do n't say them . " " I have to . " Out on my chair , Claire is now leafing through the Times . " You better go swimming without me , " I say . " Helen 's coming here ; with her husband . " " She 's married ? " " So she says . " " Why was it Helen Kepesh ' then ? " " Probably to identify herself to you . To me . " " Or to herself , " says Claire . " Would you rather I were n't here ? " " Of course not . I meant I thought you 'd prefer going . swimming . " " Only if you prefer  --  "  | " No , absolutely not . " " Where are they now ? " " Down in town . " " She came all this way  --  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at home ? " " She says they 're on their way to his family 's house in Vermont . " " They did n't take the Thruway ? " " Honey , what 's happened to you ? No , they did n't take the Thruway . Maybe they 're taking the back roads for the scenery . What 's the difference ? They 'll come and they 'll go . You were the one who told me not to be unduly anxious . " " But I would n't want you to be hurt . " " Do n't worry . If that 's why you 're staying  --  " Here suddenly she stands , and at the edge of tears ( where I have never before seen her ! ) she says , " Look , you so obviously want me out of the way  --  " Quickly she starts toward where our car is parked on the other side of the house , in the dust bowl by the old collapsing barn . And I run after her , just behind the dog , who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn , waiting together , when the Lowerys arrive . As their car makes its way up the long dirt drive to the house , Claire slips her terry-cloth robe on over her bathing suit . I am wearing a pair of corduroyshorts , a faded old T-shirt , battered sneakers , an outfit I 've probably had since Syracuse . Helen will have no trouble recognizing me . But will I recognize her ? Can I explain to Claire  --  should I have ?  --  that really , all I want is to see . . . I had heard that , on top of all her debilitating ailments ,  |p207she  had gained some twenty pounds . If so , she has by now lost all that weight , and a bit more . She emerges from the car looking exactly like herself . She is paler-complexioned than I remember  --  or rather , she is not pale in the cleansed , Quakerish way to which I am now accustomed . Helen 's pallor is luminous , transparent . Only in the thinnessof her arms and neck is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her health , and , what is more , is now a woman in her mid-thirties . Otherwise , she is the Stunning Creature once again . Her husband shakes my hand . I had been expecting someone taller and older  --  I suppose one usually does . Lowery has a close-cropped black beard , round tortoiseshellglasses , and a compact , powerful , athletic build . Both are dressed in jeans and sandals and colored polo shirts and have their hair cut in the Prince Valiant style . The only jewelry either wears is a wedding ring . All of which tells me practically nothing . Maybe the emeralds are home in the vault . We walk around as though they are prospective buyers who have been sent up by the real-estate agent to look at the house ; as though they are the new couple from down the road who have stopped by to introduce themselves ; as though they are what they are  --  ex-wife with new husband , someone now meaning nothing , artifact of relatively little remaining historical interest uncovered during an ordinary day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our so perfect lair turns out to have been neither a foolish nor , God knows , a dangerous mistake . Otherwise , how would I have known that I have been wholly de-Helenized too , that the woman can neither harm me nor charm me , that I am unbewitchable by all but thep208most loving and benign of feminine spirits . How right Claire was to caution me against being unduly anxious ; before , of course , she went ahead and  --  doubtless because of my own confusion upon hanging up the phone  --  becameunduly anxious herself . Claire is up ahead now with Les Lowery . They are headed toward the blackened , ruined oak tree at the edge of the woods . Early in the summer , during a dramatic daylong storm , the tree was struck by lightning and severed in two . While we all walked together around the house and through the garden , Claire had been talking , just a little feverishly , about the wild thunderstorms of early July ; a little feverishly , and a little childishly . I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , given the tales of her troublemaking that I have told ; I suppose I had not realized how often I must have told them to her in the first months we were together . No wonder she has latched on to the quiet husband , who does in fact seem closer to her in age and spirit , and who , it turns out , is also a subscriber to Natural History and the Audubon Magazine . Some minutesearlier , on the porch , she had identified for the Lowerys the unusual Cape Cod seashells arranged in a wicker tray in the center of the dining table , between the antique pewter candlesticks that were her grandmother'sgift upon her graduation from college . While my mate and her mate are examining the burnedouttrunk of the oak tree , Helen and I drift back to the porch . She is telling me all about him , still . He is a lawyer , a mountain climber , a skier , he is divorced , has two adolescentdaughters ; in partnership with an architect he hasp209already made a small fortune as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the work he has been doing as investigating counsel for a California State Legislaturecommittee unraveling connections between organizedcrime and the Marin County Police . . . Outside I see that Lowery has moved past the oak tree and onto the path that cuts up through the woods to the steep rock formations that Claire has been photographing all summer . Claire and Dazzle appear to be headed back down to the house . I say to Helen , " He looks a bit young to be such a Karenin . " " I 'm sure I 'd be sardonic too , " she replies , " if I were you and thought I was still me . I was surprised you even came to the phone . But that 's because you are a nice man . You always were , actually . " " Oh , Helen , what 's going on here ? Save the nice man ' stuff for my tombstone . You may have a new life , but this lingo . . . ' " I had a lot of time to think when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to know . " Tell me , " I say , interruptingher , " how was your conversation with the Schon-brunns ? " " I spoke to Arthur . She was n't home . " " And how did he take hearing from you after all this time ? " " Oh , he took it quite well . " " Frankly I 'm surprised he offered assistance . I 'm surprised you asked him for it . As I remember , he was never a great fan of yours  --  nor you of theirs . "  | " Arthur and I have changed our minds about each other . " " Since when ? You used to be very funny about him . " " I 'm not any more . I do n't ridicule people who admitwhat they want . Or at least admit to what they do n't have . " " And what does Arthur want ? Are you telling me thatall along Arthur wanted you ? " " I do n't know about all along . " " Oh , Helen , I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything easier to believe . " " And what exactly is it I 'm supposed to be believing , again ? " " When we two got back from Hong Kong , when you moved out and I was alone , he telephoned one night and asked if he could come over to talk . He was very concerned about you . So he came from his office  --  it was about nine  --  and he talked about your unhappiness for nearly an hour . I said finally that I did n't know what any of it had to do with me any more , and then he asked if he and I might meet in San Francisco for lunch one day . I said I did n't know , I was feeling pretty miserable myself , and he kissed me . And then he made me sit down and he sat down and he explained to me in detail that he had n't expected to do that , and that it did n't mean what I thought it meant . He was happily married still , and after all these years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact he owed her his whole life . And then he told me a harrowing story about some crazy girl , some librarian he had almost married in Minnesota , and how she had once gone after him with a fork at breakfast and stabbed his hand . He 'd never gotten over what might have happened to him if he had caved in and married her  --  he thinks it actually might have ended in a murder . He showed me the scar from the fork . He said his salvation was meeting Debbie , and that he owes everything he 's accomplishedto her devotion and love . Then he tried to kiss me again , and when I said I did n't think it was a good idea , he told me I was perfectly right and that he had misjudged me completely and he still wanted to have lunch with me . I really could n't take any more confusion , so I said yes . He arranged for us to eat at a place in Chinatownwhere , I assure you , nobody he knew or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that was it . But then that summer , when they moved East , he began writing letters . I still get them , every few months or so . " " Go on . What do they say ? " " Oh , they 're awfully well-written , " she says , smiling . " He must write some of those sentences ten times over before he 's completely satisfied . I think they may be the kind of letters the poetry editor of the college magazine writes late at night to his girl friend at Smith . The weather , as clear and as sharp as a fish spine , ' and so on . And sometimes he includes lines from great poems about Venus , Cleopatra , and Helen of Troy . " " Lo , this is she that was the world 's desire . ' " " That 's right  --  that 's one of them . I thought it was a bit insulting , actually . Except I suppose it ca n't be because it 's so great . ' Anyway , he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to answer ; so I do n't . Why are you smiling ? It 's really rather sweet . Well , it 's something . Who'da thunk it ? " " I smile , " I say , " because I 've had my own Schonbrunn letters  --  from her . "  | " Now , that 's hard to believe . " " No , not if you saw them . No great lines of poetry for me . " Claire is still some fifty or so feet away , yet both of us stop speaking as she makes her way back to the house . Why ? Who knows why ! And if only we had n't ! Why did n't I just talk nonsense , tell a joke , recite a poem , anything so that Claire had n't to come through the screen door into this conspiratorial silence . Had n't to come in to see me sitting across from Helen , charmed in spite of myself . Immediately she becomes stony  --  and reaches a decision . " I 'm going swimming . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Took a walk . " " You sure you do n't want some iced tea ? " I ask Claire . " Why do n't we all have some iced tea ? " " No . Bye . " That single adolescent syllable of farewell for the guest , then she 's gone . From where I am sitting I am able to watch our car pass down the hill to the road . What does Claire think we are plotting ? What are we plotting ? Says Helen , when the car is out of sight , " She 's terribly sweet . " " And I 'm a nice man , ' " I say . " I 'm sorry if I upset your friend by coming here . I did n't mean to . " " She 'll be all right . She 's a strong girl . " " And I mean you no harm . That is n't why I wanted to see you . " I am silent.  | " I did mean you harm once , that 's true , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What you did to me you did without wanting to ; you did because you were provoked . But I think now that I actually set out to torture you . " " You 're rewriting history , Helen . It 's not necessary . We tormented each other , all right , but it was n't out of malice . It was we would n't have been together for very long . " " I used to burn that fucking toast on purpose . " " As I remember , it was the fucking eggs that were burned . The fucking toast never got put in . " " I used to not mail your letters on purpose . " " Why are you saying these things ? To castigate yourself , to somehow absolve yourself , or just to try to get a rise out of me ? Even if it 's true , I do n't want to know it . That 's all dead . " " I just always hated so the ways that people killed their time . I had this grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . " " Well , that 's all dead too . Now I take what I can get , and I 'm grateful to have it . " " Oh , do n't overdo the chastened ' bit , if that 's what this is . Mr. Lowery does n't sound like the scrapings to me . He does n't look it , either . He looks like a very forcefulperson who knows what he 's about . He sounds like somebody to conjure with , taking on the Mafia and the police . He sounds like a rather courageous man of the world . Just right for you . It certainly looks like he agrees with you . "  | " Does it ? " " You look terrific , " I say  --  and am sorry I said it . So why then do I add , " You look marvelous . " For the first time since Claire came onto the porch , we fall silent again . We look unflinchingly at one another , as though we are strangers who dare , finally , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the most shameless and exciting copulation . I suppose there is no way we can avoid a little  --  if not a little more than a little  --  flirtation . Maybe I ought to say that . And then again , maybe I ought not . Maybe I ought just to look away . " What were you sick with ? " I ask . " Sick with ? It seemed like everything . I must have seen fifty doctors . All I did was sit in waiting rooms and have X-rays taken and blood taken and have cortisone injectionsand wait around drugstores to have prescriptions filled , and then bolt down the pills , hoping they 'd save me on the spot . You should have seen my medicine chest . Instead of Countess Olga 's lovely creams and lotions , vials and vials of hideous little pills  --  and none of them did a thing , except to ruin my stomach . My nose would n't stop running for over a year . I sneezed for hours on end , I could n't breathe , my face puffed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began breaking out in horrible rashes . I 'd pray when I went to sleep that they 'd just go away the way they came , that they 'd be gone for good in the morning . One allergist told me to move to Arizona , another told me it would n't help because it was all in my head , and another explained in great detail to me how I was allergic to myself , or something very like that ,  |p215and  so I went home and got into bed and pulled the covers over my face and daydreamed about having all the blood drawn out of me and replaced by somebody else 's blood , blood I could get through the rest of my life with . I nearly went crazy . Some mornings I wanted to throw myself out the window . " " But you did get better . " " I began seeing Les , " Helen says . " That 's how it seems to have happened . The ailments all began to subside , one by one . I did n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably not so hideous as you thought . It sounds as though he fell in love with you . " " After I got well I got frightened . I thought that withouthim I 'd start getting sick again . And start drinking again  --  because somehow he even got me to stop that . I said to him the night he first came to pick me up , lookingso strong and cocky and butch , I said , Look , Mr. Lowery , I 'm thirty-four years old , and I 'm sick as a dog , and I do n't like to be buggered . ' And he said , I know how old you are , and everybody gets sick some time , and buggeringdoes n't interest me . ' And so we went out , and he was so marvelously sure of himself , and he fell in love with me  --  and of course in love with rescuing me . But I did n't love him . And I wanted time and again to be finished with him . Only when it was over , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . So we were married . " I do n't reply . I look away . " I 'm going to have a baby , " she says . " Congratulations . When ? "
