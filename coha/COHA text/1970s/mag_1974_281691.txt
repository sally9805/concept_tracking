As he prepared to return to private law practice in Houston , Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski last week talked with TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey about the accomplishments of eleven months spent investigating the Watergate scandal . Highlights of the interview : <P> <P> Will the American people ever know the full story of Watergate ? <P> <P> As to the cover-up itself , yes . The full story is contained in grand jury material sent to the House Judiciary Committee and in cumulative evidence from White House tapes . This will all become public , and the American people will have the full story . <P> <P> Including Nixon 's involvement ? <P> <P> The tapes show that President Nixon knew about and participated in the cover-up within days after the Watergate breakin . <P> <P> What about the Ford-Nixon agreement concerning custody of White House tapes and other material not already obtained by your office ? <P> <P> I was never satisfied with the original agreement . Now there is an understanding to hold the tapes and docu ments here , and that 's fine . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lawyers on a new agreement . <P> <P> Do you need more White House material ? <P> <P> We have subpoenaed some original documents today Thursday for use both in the trial and in continuing investigations . <P> <P> Is it true that you approve of the pardon of Richard Nixon , including the timing ? <P> <P> I find no basis for attacking the pardon legally . It would be improper for me to comment one way or the other as to whether I approve or disapprove of it from a personal standpoint . <P> <P> What do you think would have happened had you challenged the pardon in court ? <P> <P> Eventually , the challenge would have become a farce . The pardoning power has no limitations whatsoever . <P> <P> Why should Nixon and some of the other principals be spared prison ? <P> <P> You have to ask yourself about each individual case , and the circumstances are always different . What is to be ac complished by having certain people sitting in the slammer ? <P> <P> Do you regret advising the grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give the grand jury the same advice today . There is serious legal doubt that a grand jury can indict a sitting President . I believe that the Supreme Court would have so ruled . Besides , the impeachment process was already under way . Suppose Nixon had been indicted and the Supreme Court ruled that he could not be ? Those responsible for bringing the indictment would have gravely injured the country domestically and internationally . <P> <P> But if the court did not rule that way ? <P> <P> How long would it have been before that man could have been tried ? Probably months and months . All that time he would have been the President , handling matters of gravest importance while he was under a criminal indictment . <P> <P> Are you glad that you took this job ? <P> <P> I feel better inwardly than if I had feared to undertake it . I wish it had not been tendered . It has been burdensome . It brought drastic changes in my lifestyle . But I 'm at peace with myself .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
