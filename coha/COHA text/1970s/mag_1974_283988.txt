THE CONVERSATION Directed and Written by FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA <P> Harry Caul , an electronic eavesdropper , for once lets someone listen to him . In the confessional he says to the priest , " Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . I have taken newspapers from their racks without paying . I 've deliberately taken pleasure in impure thoughts . " Then , in a great , garbled rush of feeling , he admits that he is involved in " some work " - work that may bring harm to a couple of young people . He does not wait for the priest to absolve him , however . He just mutters that he will be " in no way responsible . " <P> Harry Caul ( Gene Hackman ) has a pathological passion for his own privacy . That has its vocational advantages , of course- " the best bugger on the West Coast " ought to be as anonymous as possible . Beyond this , though , Caul 's insulation is a way of sealing himself off from his own guilt . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance operation resulted in the murder of an accountant , his wife and kids . Harry begins to see their specters in his new assignment : to record an apparently innocuous conversation between a young woman ( Cindy Williams ) and a man ( Frederic Forrest ) in a busy San Francisco park . As Caul plays and replays the conversation , he hears intimations of threat , nuances of violence , and he starts to fear for the couple 's safety . <P> The Conversation is a film of enormous enterprise and tension . It also gains , because of Watergate , an added timeliness , but it does not depend on it . More than anything , it is a film about moral paralysis , a subject that does not need headlines to lend it importance . <P> On its simplest level , The Conversation works as a subtle psychological thriller to which Coppola has given a musical construction . The conversation in the park is replayed at intervals throughout the movie-like a theme that gains color and resonance from what has preceded and surrounds it . The conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the careful distance that he preserves between his profession and his conscience . Harry 's misgivings are refracted in a series of visual metaphors : the confessional , for instance , becomes not only a tentative purging but also another ritual of ruptured privacy , of secrets overheard . Outside Harry 's apartment window , a power shovel digs , an image that will be deepened and expanded at the film 's end when Caul becomes the victim of his own technological virtuosity . <P> With The Godfather , Coppola became a superb film craftsman . Here , as before , he has had some excellent assistance-most notably that of Production Designer Dean Tavoularis and Editor Walter Murch , who worked not only on structuring the film but also on its disquieting sound track . Noises-odd and ominous , never quite real-become progressively more unsettling . <P> The film is meticulously cast . Special note should be taken of John Cazale , who is so subtle and adept as Caul 's foggy assistant that he seems once again ( he was the brother Fredo in The Godfather ) to be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents a substantial challenge . It is a largely interiorized role in contrast to the action parts on which he has recently built his career . He responds with the most sustained screen performance he has done .
