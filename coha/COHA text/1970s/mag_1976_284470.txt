KINFLICKS <P> by LISA ALTHER 503 pages . Knopf. $8.95 . <P> <P> First novels are the stepchildren of the book family . Publishers-when they agree to print one at all-seem to run off only enough copies for the author and his immediate family . Which is just as well , since none but the most cavernous bookstores bother much about making shelf space for debuts . The self-fulfilling prophecy is then in full operation : the books fail to sell , and no one is surprised . <P> Twitching Ganglia . Exceptions to this procrustean rule are rare enough to be newsworthy . Lisa Alther 's Kinflicks is enjoying a first printing of 30,000 copies , is a forthcoming alternate selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and the subject of considerable prepublication hyperbole . When the ganglia of the New York literary world begin to twitch in this manner , it is a sure sign that something more than literary merit is at work . First books by unknowns do not become events simply because they are good . Frequently , as Mae West once observed in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Kinflicks , in fact , is soaring in the slip stream of Fear of Flying , Erica Jong 's bestselling hymn to the body electric . The novel proves again-if any doubters still remain-that women can write about physical functions just as frankly and , when the genes move them , as raunchily as men . It strikes a blow for the picara by putting a heroine through the same paces that once animated a Tom Jones or a Holden Caulfield . And it suggests that life seen from what was once called the distaff side suspiciously resembles the genitalia-centered existence that male novelists have so long monopolized . The organs are different ; the scoring is the same . <P> Kinflicks is also an abundantly entertaining progress through the unsettled 60s . Virginia Hull Babcock , 27 , comes home to Tennessee to care for her ailing mother . The act is not exactly unselfish , since Ginny has nowhere else to go ; her Vermont husband has just thrown her out for practicing sexual yoga with a Viet Nam War resister . The home-town setting reminds Ginny of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them-that her parents lavished on the events of her childhood . She begins mentally unreeling the X-rated scenes the old folks never saw . <P> Ginny first replays her gropings with Joe Bob Sparks , the imbecile high-school star athlete whose lettered jacket " looked like the rear window of a Winnebago with stickers from every state . " From there she moves on to kinky sex with Clem Cloyd , the town hoodlum , and then to a proper Boston women 's college , " alma mater of vast battalions of female overachievers . " When her prim devotion to the rationalism of Descartes collapses under the onslaught of Nietzsche , she drops out of school and into a lesbian affair with a leathery radical . A communal farm in Vermont claims Ginny next , and ultimately she sinks into a mindless marriage with the local snowmobile salesman . " The incidents in her life to date , " Ginny fatuously decides , " resembled the Stations of the Cross more than anything else . If this was adulthood , the only improvement she could detect in her situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vegetables . "
