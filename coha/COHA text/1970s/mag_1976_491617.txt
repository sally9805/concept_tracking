By Frederic A. Birzytinghana hi one sense , kidnapping is the ultimate crime . It has the simple , indecent clarity of a knife held over the jugular vein . We are holding someone you value . Pay up or we kill . This is worse in some ways than many murders . Sometimes murder is a crime of passion , of sudden impulse , or even drunken or drugged incomprehension . But kidnapping is premeditated , pre-planned , and ruthless . And when plans go awry , quite often the only way out , it would seem to the criminals involved , is to murder the victim . Clearly , no one with a well-balanced mentality would approach such a crime when there are banks to be robbed , or extortion and blackmail possible without involving the death penalty directed at the protection of the innocent . But kidnapping is on the increase in our time , and this fact may be the most deplorable trend of all . The Patty Hearst abduction has caught the attention of the world , because it brings a new element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign behavior pattern . The mere seizure of a victim for the extortion of a healthy price slides back deep into history . Yet strangely enough , the old kidnappings had a certain sense of style and chivalry about them . A king or a noble might be unhorsed in medieval battle , held to the ground by the very weight of his armor which was to protect him . Good common sense indicated that instead of chopping off his head , which could terminate a lot of difficulties as well as the hostility of the incumbent , it just might be a good idea to cart him off somewhere , entertain him according to his rank with good food and the company ofcomplaisant ladies , and leave it to his countrymen and allies to ransom their liege and overlord . A lot of jewels and gold had to be coughed up by his underlings to accomplish this , and the peasants of his nation might have to lose the fruits of their labors , cut up a lot of faggots and raise a lot of pigs before their lord was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of killing him was carried out . It was part of the leisurely warfare of the time , a game that would be a shame to bring to any kind of conclusion too soon . King Richard the Lionhearted of England languished under such a strain in the land of the Austrians in the time of the Crusades , but he suffered few ill effects from his stay there , except some mismanagement at home in his absence on the part of his rascally brother John . But that was par for the course , and fully balanced by providing first-rate plot material for future epics of poetry , and much later on , motion pictures of magnificent pageantry and some outstandingly inaccurate historical research . When those good-natured romantic flurries of battlefield kidnapping had subsided , however , kidnapping descended to its present frightening level of criminals living off society like wolves slashing down on the innocent lambs in the fold , so that we find ourselves up against quite another thing entirely . In a number of cases , which we shall review here for the examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , stating that the abduction of four-year-old Charley Brewster Ross of Philadelphia " became the focal point of a great and dramatic search which in some way involved every man , woman and child in the United States . " Over the years , more than five thousand men came forward to swear they were the long-lost Charley Ross . " He became a nation 's obsession . " But in truth little Charley was never seen again . And now , it would seem , kidnapping has become an obsession of the underworld . The chief of police in Milan recently stated , " I am afraid kidnapping is the crime of the future . " Corporation actually paid Argentine extortionists $14.2 million in order to rescue a refinery manager in Argentina from his captors . And the practice is on the increase in Venezuela , Mexico , Colombia , Sardinia and Sicily , where the business of kidnapping has been virtually raised to an art form . A summing up in 1974 revealed that in the preceding five years twenty-five American officials had been kidnapped abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pay ransom to kidnappers . ) In a later check , the State Department listed twenty-five " significant " terrorist kidnap road , the innocent victim has been killed , mindlessly and mercilessly , sometimes in spite of the efforts on the part of the victim 's family or friends to produce the ransom money demanded . But what is even more alarming in our time has been an outcropping of kidnapping for reasons more complex than the simple extortion contained in " your money , or this life . " Kidnapping has become a political and social weapon as well as a pure crime of violence and intimidation . Kidnapping was once a rare crime . America 's first kidnapping for ransom occurred in 1874 and was so much a cause c  --  l ? bre that it involved the emotions and efforts of the entire nation . Little Charley Ross was kidnapped , and a ransom of $20,000 demanded  --  an enormous sum for the time . The uproar was so great that as recently as 1967 a book was written It certainly is in South America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant U.S. corporation and ask an exorbitant ransom in exchange for his life . The First National Bank of Boston paid $750,000 for the release of a branch manager . The British-American Tobacco Company paid $1.8 million for the release of its Argentine Board Chairman . Ford Motor Company was forced to produce over $1 million in cash , ambulances , food and books to the " People 's Revolutionary Army " of Argentina in exchange for the life of its top local executive . Kodak , Coca-Cola and ITT were other victims . The Otis Elevator Company was threatened with the execution of a company official , unless Otis coughed up $500,000 in cash and granted all of the firm 's Argentine employees a 100 percent pay increase . Believe it or not , Exxonattacks since 1968 involving U.S. officials serving abroad . Nine , including two ambassadors , have been slain . The armies of " liberation " are on the march  --  for dollars . Historically , almost the most unthinkable attempted kidnapping of all was that directed against Britain 's Princess Anne , by twenty-six-year-old Ian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to attack that most sacred institution of all , the British royal family . In France , a wealthy automobile executive was kidnapped in order to gain some leverage in a dispute at his company over the firing of some workers and their demand to be rehired . In Canada , kidnappers made the price of abducting government officials a safe passage out of the country . There comes to mind the grisly reminder mailed by the kidnappers of Eugene Paul Getty II -- a severed ear along with a lock of the fifteen-year-old 's reddish hair . Telling his story later , the grandson of oil billionaire J. Paul Getty said : " I kept thinking about them threatening to cut me if they did n't get the money and I thought , ' Oh , Christ , they 're really gon na do it . ' I thought they 'd cut one of my fingers off and I remember looking at my hands a lot that night .... About eight or nine of them came in and one of them said , ' Put on your blindfold . ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a block of wood in the room , what you might call a chopping block . They gave me a handkerand it destroyed me to think I could n't use sunglasses because . . . . how would I hook them on me ? " Kidnapped in Rome July 9 , 1973 , the Getty youth was held five months and five days in huts and caves in the wilder , remoter areas of the Italian back country . The ransom asked was huge , and the family and police hesitated  --  suspecting for a time that the boy had staged his own disappearance as a way to get money . The arrival of the ear  --  and subsequent photos of the mutilated youth  --  changed all that , and the family paid $2,890,000 ( most was later recovered ) for the boy 's release . In our own country , that most predict- Some have the " almost " quality , in which the victim comes through alive and well after a harrowing experience . Brooklyn businessman Jack Teich was kidnapped from the driveway of his home by two armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Teich was held captive by four men , chained in the closet of a New York City apartment . On November 19 , after $750,000 in ransom money had been delivered to the kidnappers at Penn Station , Teich was released to his family .

" I kept thinking that I would n't be able to wear sunglasses again . I love sunglassesable of all human motives  --  greed  --  seems to be at the bottom of our kidnappings . At least thirty kidnappings were reported in the United States within five months of Patty Hearst 's abduction . It could be done , the criminals saw . Some of the crimes followed the Hearst pattern in that the kidnappers emerge as a bunch of kook hoods who have clothed a natural tendency toward crime and violence with a weird framework of anti-establishment jargon in order to justify a contemptible crime . But the danger is always there . It is money versus murder . And sometimes , it would appear , even criminals capable of kidnapping crack in the middle of the operation and kill their victim out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The case histories are ghoulishly instructive . Jaffray &; Hopwood , Inc. , Mrs. Piper had been abducted from her home in Minneapolis two days earlier , on July 27 , 1972 . Her husband paid $1 million ransom and an anonymous telephone tip led rescuers to her in time to save her life . While the typical kidnapping victim is young , white and wealthy , no one is immune . In January , an eighty-threeyear-old black businessman , A. G. Gaston , was beaten and kidnapped ; his wife was knocked unconscious and left handcuffed on her bed in the family home . The police , alerted after Mrs. Gaston regained consciousness and managed to reach the telephone , picked up Gaston 's car and found him , handcuffed and wrapped in a blanket , on the rear seat . Earlier , two boys from a black Detroit neighborhood , aged six and eight , were found slain after their abductors failed to get ransom . Pathetic in its aspect of " what could have been " is the case of Mrs. Charles Marter , wife of the vice-president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother of two young children , just thirty-six years old herself . She was kidnapped on the afternoon of January 12 , 1976 . Mrs. Marter was at home at the time , with her three-year-old son ; her nine-year-old was at a catechism class at their Catholic Church . The kidnapper had apparently selected the bank at random , and called in to ask for the name of the senior commercial officer . Given the name of Charles Marter , the alleged abductor , Richard Gerald Jordan , the victim , shot in the back of the head . Jordan 's story : Mrs. Marter had broken free from him and run to escape . He tried to fire his pistol over her head , according to his story , but hit her fatally in the back of the head . It could have happened the day of the kidnapping , possibly on Tuesday . But the alleged abductor asked for the ransom money after he killed the woman . He was caught by the law officers after he picked up the ransom money  --  they had watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cache the ransom funds beneath a house in the area , abandoning his car as he did so . The money was recovered . An almost unbearone morning there was a knock at the door . Mrs. Mackle opened up , and was forced aside by an armed couple who used chloroform to subdue her and then left her bound when they carried away the nightgown-clad brunette heiress . Back home in Miami the father was contacted by telephone . Two days after the abduction he lowered a suitcase packed with 25,000 old twenty-dollar bills over the seawall to the kidnappers who chugged off in a stolen motorboat . They beached the boat a mile away and were walking across the beach , carrying the suitcase of money toward their parked car , when things began to go wrong . simply looked up the home address of the Marters in a local telephone directory . The family lived on Southern Circle in a pleasant residential area of Mississippi City . The man simply entered there and abducted Mrs. Marter , abandoning the three-year-old boy alone in the house . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happened then is unaccountably tragic . On the following day , Mr. Marter received a telephone call demanding $25,000 for the release of his wife . He was told to leave it at a point on the Gulf interstate highway , about 180 miles south of Jackson , Mississippi . He did so . He never heard from the abductor again . There was good enough reason for that . State officials picked up Jordan on suspicion , and he led them to the body ofable footnote to the tragedy : ironically , Charles Marter had only a year previously taken an FBI-sponsored course in what one should do if someone tried to extort money from him . But life , both the good and the bad , does not always work out for us the way we expect it . No kidnap victim survived a more harrowing experience than Barbara Jane Mackie , who was literally buried alive for eighty hours in a wooded area outside Atlanta . The daughter of multimillionaire Florida land developer Robert F. Mackie , Barbara was twenty years old and a student at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransom in December , 1968 . Because the girl was ill with influenza , her mother had come to Atlanta and moved her to an off-campus motel . Early A sheriff 's deputy who knew nothing of the ransom pickup approached in a marked car . The two kidnappers panicked and fired at him . The sheriff 's deputy pulled his gun and fired back . The men fled on foot , dropping the suitcase which was subsequently returned to Mr. Mackie . Fearing the worst , Mackie published a plea to the kidnappers : " Please contact me through any channel . " They did telephone again , and a successful drop was carried out the next day . Meanwhile , the FBI received a tip that led them to Barbara 's " tomb . " In a remote , wooded area twenty miles outside Atlanta she lay in a buried wooden box . The kidnappers had left her food and water , and an arrangement of two pipes and a battery-operated fan provided an air supply for a short time only . A few more days , and Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The registration on the abandoned car and serial numbers on twenty-dollar bills used to buy another boat pointed to Gary Steven Krist , captured a few days later on swampy , snake-infested Hog Island off the west coast of Florida . His accomplice , Ruth Eisemann Schier , was apprehended later . All but a few dollars of the ransom money was recovered . The hard news goes on and on . The partially decomposed body of Emanuel Gambino was found in a grave in Colts Neck , New Jersey , on January 26 , 1973 , eight months after the family paid $350,000 ransom . He was a nephew of reputed Mafia boss C. Gambino . The New Jersey State Police broadcast a seventeen-state alarm on March 22 , 1975 for elevenyear-old Esli Hall and her six-year-old brother Robert , who were apparently abducted on their way to school . Eyewitnesses reported that they saw the children approached in a parking lot near their school . They were report . edly dragged into a car and driven away . Two weeks later , Esli Hall 's body was found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey . The coroner 's exam revealed that the death was the result of strangulation and that the girl had been sexually molested . Her brother 's body was found in a marsh nearby . The sad records are never more deplorable than when they personify the original meaning of the word " kidnap " ? which literally designates the seizing of a child . Ten-year-old Charles Mattson , of Tacoma , Washington , disappeared in 1936 . Peter Levine , twelve , was kidnapped in New Rochelle , New York , in 1938 . Both boys were murdered . The most celebrated kidnapping of our century reads like a Greek tragedy , wherein the hero reaches the pinnacle of achievement only to have what he holds dearest to him snatched away in the cruelest way . The scene is the village of Hopewell , fourteen miles from Trenton , New Jersey . The time is 8:30 p.m. , March 1 , 1932 . Outside , it is a cold and damp evening but inside the new Lindbergh home , so new that draperies have nol been fitted to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - old Charles has had his supper and is being readied for bed by Betty Gow , the Scottish nursemaid , and by his mother Anne . ( Betty has quickly stitched a flannel nightshirt to go next to his skin as the boy is recovering from a cold . ) Snuggled up in a fresh woolen sleeping suit , with sheets and blankets fastened to the mattress with two large safety pins , Charles , Jr. , is soon sound asleep upstairs . His famous father returns after a day in New York visiting the offices of Pan American Airways and Transcontinental Air Transport , Inc. , where he serves as consultant . Five years have elapsed since his historic flight over the Atlantic in the flimsy Spirit of St. Louis , but the modest , gangling Colonel is still the idol of the world . After supper , the young husband and wife sit chatting in the living room . There is a sound of breaking wood heard above the howl of the wind , but little attention is paid to it . Eventually , Charles goes to the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is n't feeling too well ; she might have caught the baby 's cold . Betty meanwhile is entering the child 's room to make a final check . Oddly , she does not hear the child 's breathing . The blankets are bundled as if he were still there ... but he is not . Without too much alarm , she calls for the parents . One must surely have him . They all return to the bedroom , empty-handed . The light is switched on and the full horror of the moment hits them . Only the impression of his head on the pillow . And over by the window , an envelope . The rest is history  --  the world taking over the private grief of the family . Not only was the aftermath to be stranger than fiction but , as Mrs. Lindbergh points out in her book of diaries and letters , Hour of Gold , Hour of Lead , it brought out the full jumble of human emotion : " As in war , the case , like a great bubbling cauldron of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greed , madness , cruelty and indifference were countered by goodness , devotion , self-sacrifice and courage . There were people who fluttered around the flame of publicity , politicians who came and posed for pictures next to the kidnapper 's ladder . There was one city official , acting as self-appointed investigator , who woke me in the middle of the night and asked me to reenact his theory of the crime , which ended with the imaginary throwing of a baby into the furnace . " At first there was hope . One of the baby 's thumb guards had been found on the grounds . The kidnapper had left his makeshift ladder beneath the bedroom window ; surely Arthur Koehler , the wood-identification expert , would lead them to the criminal . The ransom note was crudely written , the work of an amateur . Weeks passed by with no word of the child . There was , however , another tragedy . Violet Sharpe , a maidservant at the Englewood estate of Mrs. Lindbergh 's mother , was repeatedly questioned by the police on the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as events turned out , the girl poisoned herself . Meanwhile , by a series of odd coincidences , Dr. John F. Condon , a retired seventy-one-year-old educator , was acting as go-between with an exchange of messages in the Bronx Home News over the ransom . The Colonel had raised $70,000 by selling $350,000 worth of stock at a bargain price . Then followed those doleful nocturnal meetings in cemeteries between Condon and the kidnapper , and the latter 's fateful words : " Would I burn if the baby is dead ? " Events seemed to be reaching a conclusion . Both Lindbergh and the police were off on a promising lead  --  actually an elaborate hoax by a person with nothing to do with the crime  --  which took them out to sea in search of a nonexistent Mary .8 . Moss . With all the suddenness of tragedy , on the seventy-second day of the investigation , a passerby stumbled on the shallow grave of the young Lindbergh , close to his father 's estate . He had been dead all the time of the negotiations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lives  --  those of children of the Thirties who were , like the victim , rich and the bearers of famous names . Fearful parents erected high walls around their estates , barred the windows of the rooms where their children slept , hired extra nursemaids and chauffeurs ix ? maintain round-the-clock surveillance . " My so-called childhood was ghastly , " says the heir to a Midwest industrial fortune . " I was never allowed to walk to school , or to go to a friend 's house to play . When I got a bike I could ride it only inside our fenced-in yard , round and round till I 'd worn a track just inside the fence . My folks received some kind of telephoned threat once  --  most wealthy people with children did , I guess  --  and they were terrified of kidnappers . I was watched , protected . for a lively , lonely kid it was hell ! " Another gruesome kidnapping of a boy occurred in Kansas City the early part of October , 1953 . Sixyear-old Robert Greenlease , son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cold blood by a couple of callous whiskey swillers . Life went by pleasantly in the mansions of the Mission Hills district . Bobby was an alert youngster who knew what he wanted and usually got it . His kiddie car was a battery-powered jeep scaled to his size ; his pets included a green parrot and a French poodle . One morning , a woman with red-tinted hair called at Bobby 's school , the exclusive French Institute of Notre Dame de Sion , and asked if the boy could be released to be taken to see his mother who had just been rushed to the hospital . The nuns agreed and the taxi drove away . Soon after , the Greenlease home was contacted  --  and the mother answered the phone . Obviously , Bobby had been kidnapped . His father immediately offered a " blank check " for his son 's safe return . Eventually , he had to pay $600,000 ( it took eighty clerks at the Commerce Trust Bank to count the money and record the serial numbers ) . Seven days of parleying had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call was made to the house that the boy would soon be released . Hopes ran high . But instead of the expected telephone call , the ransom money began to show up two days after " the drop . " Meanwhile , 120,000 members of the AFL National Association of Letter Carriers and half a million members of the AFL Teamsters Union , mainly delivery drivers , began a nationwide lookout for the missing boy . No luck . Things had reached a stalemate . It was left to the kidnappers to betray themselves . The case suddenly broke with a telephone call to police from a taxi driver in West St. Louis . He reported a suspicious free-spending customer . Police Lieutenant Louis Shoulders called at the cheap apartment where the driver had taken his client . Not until he opened a suitcase brimming with money did he even suspect that he had stumbled upon the Greenlease kidnapper . The man was Carl Austin Hall , thirty-four , a thief , an alcoholic and a morphine addict ( one-half grain every six hours ) . He had wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to petty crime and while imprisoned in 1952 had worked on how to get even with the Greenleases  --  as he had envied the wealth of one member of the family who had been his schoolmate years before . His accomplice was soon tracked down and her character proved little better . Bonnie Brown Heady had been happily married to a livestock broker , but a year previously her personality had begun to change . Her marriage broke up ; she became a prostitute and lived in a drunken stupor on a quart of liquor a day . She had met Hall , and together they plotted the Greenlease kidnap . The confession to the crime poured out , almost proudly ; but the ending was grisly . They had dug the grave near the kitchen door of Heady 's house in St. Joseph , Missouri , and had bought quicklime  --  before the abduction . Police went to the spot and found the body of Bobby Greenlease . In the woman 's car were bloodstains and a .38 slug embedded in the floor . Hall admitted shooting the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of road twelve miles east of Kansas City ... while his accomplice walked away to stroll with her dog , Doc . The puzzling affinity for kidnapping by the worst criminal element in the United States is in some ways a reflection  --  and not necessarily a very bad one  --  of certain attitudes Americans share as a whole . We are not averse , as a nation and as individuals , to the pleasures of the limelight : center stage has never made the typical American uncomfortable . In fact , he feels comfortable there , as part of the heritage of freedom . And so , in the mixed motives behind our peculiar fascination with kidnapping may well be the desire on the part of certain individuals ( fated never to make the headlines any other way ) to break into the " big time " of the underworld with a shocklingly sensational crime , keyed to an enormous sum of money , which somehow or other in the minds of the abductor seems to minimize the huge actual economic gap between the kidnapper and the well-to-do family he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlines with celebrities , the top families of the nation . Another peculiarly American aspect of kidnapping has been voiced by Dr. Kenneth Modlin , director of preventive psychiatry at the Henninger Institute in Topeka , Kansas in a UPI interview : " There is some thought that Americans are particularly easy marks for kidnappers because of the value they place on life . In many parts of the world , life is very cheap .. . But Americans value it so highly we are willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to get it back . We are softies , and are being taken advantage of . Other parts of the world must think that peculiar . " The Patty Hearst case , however , was so unpredictable and bizarre in all of its aspects that it followed none of the generalizations which had been applied to previous kidnappings . The Hearst abduction was a witches ' cauldron of violence , delusions of military grandeur , sexual perversion and racist hatred on the part of its perpetrators . But more than that , it was probably the firsttime that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim to break down her will to resist , and in the end , build up a self-identification with the very people who were imprisoning and degrading her . Patty was abducted by the so-called Symbionese Liberation Army , led by one Donald DeFreeze , a Black male motivated by delusions of grandeur linked with a consistent dedication to crime for its own sake . He was a high school dropout who graduated into criminal pursuits with such devotion that by the time he was sixteen he had a police record which included raps for burglary and grand larceny and no less than fourteen felony arrests in New Jersey , New York and California . He found a convenient way out of responsibility for these by becoming a police informant in 1967 . The police soon discovered that DeFreeze was an accomplished underground informant . He led police to his crime partner 's hideout and used a secret code word so that his partner opened the door into the waiting arms of the police . The partner was arrested and De-Freeze got off . DeFreeze became a steady informant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime in a string of felonies and misdemeanors which included making bombs , dealing in stolen weapons and pimping for prostitutes . The charges were dropped when he implicated an associate for another crime . When he was arrested for stealing a motorcycle and again for carrying a 9-millimeter semi-automatic rifle and ammunition , he was able to get off both times by informing on his comrades in crime . In the spring of 1969 , he traveled to New Jersey , to escape not only the California police , but also his fellow criminals on whom he had ratted . In Newark , New Jersey , he kidnapped at gunpoint the caretaker of the Temple B'Nai Abraham and demanded $5,000 ransom from the temple coffers . He did n't collect the money , was arrested , but became a free man when the charges were mysteriously dropped . Heading west again , DeFreeze struck in Cleveland and was arrested for attempted robbery . He posted bond and returned to California where he was arrested after a shoot-out in a bank and was sentenced to fifteen years . He was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was transferred to Sole-dad . Officials at the prison allowed DeFreeze to work in an unguarded area and he escaped easily in 1973 . Then DeFreeze went underground in San Francisco and gave vent to his dreams of military glory by adopting the grandiloquent title of " General Field Marshal Cinque , " and placing himself at the head of a small group of die-hards , out to fight the rest of the world under the name of the Symbionese Liberation Army . There were eighteen in the ranks . There is no need to visualize this group as a gathering of happy idealists attempting to nudge our world toward better things . When the group first surfaced in November 1973 it claimed full responsibility for the slaying of the black superintendent of schools in Oakland , California and the wounding of his aide , ambushing their victims in military style . The SLA then informed the other school board members that if student ID 's and campus police were not withdrawn from the campus scene in Oakland , they would be executed . The SLA drew up formal papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black , Brown , White , Women 's , Grey and Gay Liberation Movements . " They have a lot to say in their pronunciamentos , but you can get the underlying message when they state their purpose of banding together as " The Liquidation of the Common Enemy " ? which includes everyone else . This is the group which on February 4 , 1974 sent three of its members to Berkeley to abduct Patty Hearst , which they accomplished after beating up her fiance , Steven Weed , in the process . The thing that makes the Hearst kidnapping different from the others we have here reviewed is that DeFreeze and the others of his sordid SLA group had been thoroughly schooled in the art of behavior modification ( popularly called " brainwashing " ) . As alumni of a class conducted by an expert on the techniques at the Vacaville Prison Medical Facility , they considered this as important a part of their anti-society campaign as their high-powered weapons . DeFreeze , with his long ruthless criminal record , was hardly the type of individual who without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression on Patty Hearst . Young and helpless Patty was presumably given the full brainwashing treatment after her abduction . In typical modus operandi for this kind of procedure , she was locked in a small coat closet and left to wallow in her own excrement . She was threatened with bodily mutilation and death , until identification with the SLA would appear to be the only way out for her . This same procedure was used successfully by the communists against United States POW 's in both Korea and Vietnam . The victim is deprived of all human dignity , light , water , air , until total submission to his captors ' commands is the only course of action other than death . It is a sad and horrifying tale . One doubts if at any time the full story will be understood . One thing is sure , however  --  for Patty Hearst , as for all kidnapping victims and the members of their families , life would never be the same .               @ @ @ @ @ @
