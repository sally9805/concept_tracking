txt Grasping a new weapon handed them recently by the Supreme Court of the United States , Boston and a number of other cities are cracking down on one form of obscenity that has burgeoned in the last few years : nude dancing and " sex shows " in bars and nightclubs . Though courts in the past have rebuffed such crackdowns on grounds of First Amendment free-speech rights , the high court 's latest ruling opened the way for local regulations that seem to have a better chance of survival . In Boston , New York , San Francisco , and elsewhere , the Supreme Court 's guidelines are being carefully followed . Those guide lines were provided last month in a landmark decision on a California case . The court said those who issue and control liquor licenses have the power to regulate conduct " contrary to public welfare or morals . " The decision was based on the 21st Amendment of 1933 , which repealed Prohibition and has usually been used in cases dealing with the transportation and taxing of liquor . Boston Licensing Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California case since 1968 , moved quicky to establish regulations regarding " attire and conduct of employees , entertainers , and other persons " ? that is , sex shows , nude dancing , and other displays of " gross sexuality . " The regulations went into effect Jan. 1 . The rules leave club owners no doubt about what is allowed and apply to films , slides , photos , or any other reproduction of the acts , real or simulated . They also regulate employee ( and customer ) attire , making illegal " topless " and or " bottomless " waitresses , At a public hearing last week , board members heard testimony on the new regulations from law-enforcement officers , city officials , neighborhood groups , and the Civil Liberties Union . Capt . Daniel J. MacDonald , commander of the Boston vice squad , described examples of sexual acts observed in clubs in the city 's infamous " combat zone , " an area of bars , movie houses , and pornography vendors a block from Boston Common . Prostitution has increased 40 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and off-duty entertainers often solicit customers for prostitution purposes , Captain MacDonald testified . // *Boston cues entertainers to cover up // In the name of the Boston Police Department , I enthusiastically endorse the regulations , " he said . " The new set of rules will be good for everybody concerned . " Speaking for the Back Bay Federation for Community Development and the Back Bay Association , Daniel Ahern said it is " Fraudulent nonsense " and " economically very destructive " to assume a city needs such entertainment to attract convention and tourist trade . " There is economic deterioration going on week by week in the combat zone , " he said . " These areas eventually become urban-renewal areas at great expense to everyone . " The only person to testify in opposition to the new regulations was John Reinstein , an attorney for the Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts . Mr. Reinstein suggested Boston 's regulations " go much beyond " the Supreme Court ruling in attempting " to establish dress codes for those who enter bars . " California code copied John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , countered that the city 's regulations follow " word for word " California 's rules as approved by the Supreme Court . Expressing frustration at past attempts to control pornography , Mr. Fiske said , " So far any attempts by the city to be a censor or enforce the obscentiy laws of Massachusetts have been unsuccessful . " I defy anybody to get a conviction that will stick on anything in this day and age , " he said . " It 's almost hopeless in America in 1973 to define what 's obscene and what is n't . " Mr. Fiske said he hopes that regulations will " become self-enforcing , " but added that the board has the power to modify , suspend , revoke , or cancel violators ' liquor licenses . Violations reported Captain MacDonald told the Monitor two violations have been reported by undercover policemen since Jan. 1 and these will come before the board soon . In a telephone interview before the hearing , Mr Ahern said Boston has suffered from a " lack of planning and scattered regulatory agencies " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " everything from an opera house to a roller skating rink , " he said . Mr. Ahern expressed optimism at the " progress coming after a long frustrating period . " " A lot of progress can be made in 1973 , but it depends upon how much initiative is taken by the city administration . "
