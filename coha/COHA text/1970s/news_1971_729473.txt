txt Day after day , the controversial American labor leader wrestled with the problem . He badly wanted to return to power as head of the free world 's largest labor union , but . . . . James R. Hoffa was in a prison cell , and finally it came down to whether or not his candidacy would cause serious schisms in the union ? the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . Indications were that it might . And so , despite his unwillingness to turn from a fight , and despite his fierce loyalty to the truck drivers in the union that for many years he ran with unquestioned authority , Hoffa reluctantly decided he had reached the end of the road . Some legal aides , some pressures from outside the union , and the urgings of associates all helped push him along , until on June 3 he announced he would not seek the presidency at the Teamsters Union convention in Miami Beach next month . Hoffa , now serving a 13-year sentence in the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg , Pa. , endorsed Frank E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past four years , as his successor . The executive board backed him unanimously . Mr. Fitzsimmons ' election is considered certain . // *Hoffa drops out of race // From a personal standpoint , Hoffa is and has been deeply concerned about the health of his wife , Josephine , who suffered a heart attack in San Francisco earlier this year . He wanted to be free to be with her  --  and there were " suggestions " from government attorneys , never anything official , but straws in the legal and judicial wind , that his freedom would depend on giving up the important base of his labor power , the teamsters presidency . On Wednesday , Hoffa 's son , James P. Hoffa , a Teamsters Union lawyer in Detroit , conferred at length with his father in Lewisburg , remaining there overnight . He returned to Washington with a signed message to the Teamsters Union board from his father : He would not run again . Five years ago , at the teamsters ' last convention , Hoffa chose Mr. Fitzsimmons , a Detroit associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he fail in efforts to escape serving a jury-tampering sentence . In less than a year Mr. Fitzsimmons was president of the union in all but name . This week , Hoffa acted differently . He had said , not long ago , that he would be a candidate for reelection if he felt that he would be able to serve even half of a new five-year term in office . Legal difficulties cited However , in his letter to the board , he said that the teamsters must have a president willing and able to give " all of his time " to the arduous duties of his office . He would not be able to do so , he said , because he is still " unable to say how legal difficulties will be resolved . " He thanked " the many thousands " of union members who have urged that he seeks reelection  --  and then he urged unanimous support for Mr. Fitzsimmons . By doing so , Hoffa may be soon free , but not until after the union 's convention . It would take only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " movement that almost certainly would sweep him to reelection . It is n't that Mr. Fitzsimmons is opposed , but simply that there is and can be only one Jimmy Hoffa for those who will be in the majority of the teamster delegates . With Hoffa jailed , Mr. Fitzsimmons loosened the power reins , and the lower-level leaders regained a substantial part of their autonomy . The Hoffa stand-in won his first support in that way , a weaker leader who let the men below him handle business in their own way . But subsequently Mr. Fitzsimmons demonstrated strength of his own , and today he is respected as a competent leader for a strong and still growing union . Close watch expected Mr. Fitzsimmons , however , has been under the Hoffa shadow . Whatever he did , he was considered to be doing it in Hoffa 's name and with his cachet of approval . He consulted with others more , and he was opposed often , but he was never seriously challenged in top-level ranks . The question is : Will he be more so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will he veer farther away from Hoffa policies than he has already ? Meanwhile , there are questions , too , about Hoffa 's future in the Teamsters Union . Will he retain a power base ? He continues , so far , as head of the 30,000-member Local 229 in Detroit , and as head of the teamsters organization in Michigan . Unless he bows out of these , he can continue to have strong influence in the union . And while the teamsters executive board welcomed Hoffa 's decision to retire , it is unlikely that Hoffa 's partisans in Detroit and the state would let him go as willingly : He is a source of power for them within a union of potentially contesting power blocs . Hoffa may be gone from the top  --  but not very far down
