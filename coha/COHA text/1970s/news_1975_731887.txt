txt Letters to the Editor pg . 21 Letters to the Editor Electric Rate Increases and Customers To the Editor : Today 's Times carried a front-page story reporting Con Edison 's request for a two-step 21.7 per cent increase in electric rates estimated to produce $456 million in additional income . This proposed increase comes only a few months after the Public Service Commission 's approval of a prior electric rate increase for the company designed to yield $300 million annually . Aside from the serious question ( not considered herein ) which exists as to the propriety of the proposed rate increase and which was so promptly and justifiably raised in challenges by both Mayor Beame and Consumer Affairs Commissioner Guggenheimer , there is another important aspect which seems to have been overlooked . It surfaced during the news conference at which Mr. Luce , Con Edison 's chairman , outlined the company 's case for its current request , which included the need to " obtain enough ( new ) capital to finance new projects . " But consider what then results : If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those needed to offset Increased operating costs become part of the net income of the company . This in turn increases retained earnings and likewise Taxpayer Inequities To the Editor : The tax relief bill recently passed by Congress contains a major inequity in its treatment of taxpayers who itemize deductions vs. those who take the standard deduction . While an increase is provided in the maximum allowable standard deduction which , for a middleincome family in the 25 per cent bracket would amount to $150 annual tax savings , no comparable relief is provided for families who do itemize . Many families Itemize deductions because they are homeowners and can apply their interest and taxes to their deductions . These homeowners have been burdened with a doubling of the cost of heating their homes in the last two years . Many apartment dwellers , on the other hand , have not had the cost of these fuel increases passed on to them due to rent control or lease terms . Further fuel-oil price increases will add to this burden , as additional taxes or import restrictions are imposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent in the same period , could absorb these increases without exceeding double their previous levels . Congress should make an effort , in writing the energy bill , to grant homeowners a tax offset equivalent to that given to those who take the standard deduction . The proposed tax credit for insulation is not the answer , since it is a one-time item , and of no help to homeowners like myself who have alOf Affirmative Action To the Editor : Mordeca Jane Pollock is right : There is discrimination against women in academics . It is unjust . Positions should be made available without regard to race or sex . Op-Ed March 4 . But she Is wrong about other things . Not only women are injured by " old boys " networks . They are not so much sexist as clubby , and all of us ? boys and girls  --  are excluded who are not " old boys . " Hiring is often done this way , but it is also often done by merit . How else to explain the truly outstanding departments found at many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given equal opportunities because everybody should be given equal opportunities . But they should not be given more than equal opportunities . If discrimination against them was wrong , so is discrimination against others . " Affirmative action " should mean a determined effort to find the best candidates . The proper function of government is to require such effort . Neither government nor university should define the result by requiring a specific number to be hired . This is not just . No one knows what percentage of women or minorities would have been academics if not for discrimination . augments capital . The corresponding funds thus remaining unspent are now available for investment in new plant and equipment . Unless regulated , such acquisitions automatically increase the company 's base for future rate-making computations . It is submitted that to the extent that such funds as are utilized for plant expansion represent retained earnings which are neither contributed or borrowed capital , nor the ordinary accumulations of earnings resulting from prudent managerial policy , but are rather the outcome of special windfalls produced by rate increases specifically designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of plant so acquired should be separately ascertained and excluded in all future determinations from the rate base as a form of contribution by consumers in aid of construction of plant and equipment . While it is true that any such increase must necessarily result in an increment in the value of the holdings of shareholders , insult is added to injury if it gives them a future return on capital contributed not by them but by the company 's unwilling customers .

An attractive solution would be to allow an itemized deduction for fuel used to heat the home . For the average homeowner , that would result in a tax saving roughly equal to that granted those who take the standard deduction . It could also provide relief to landlords and thus remove the inflationary pressure of increased fuel costs on rents . ALEX E. FRIEDLANDER Brooklyn , April 2 , 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 1972 , I was mugged at the front door of my house in Hollis Hills , Queens . The mugger was caught within three hours of my report to the police . I pressed charges and six hearings over a span of six months ensued . When my father and I walked into the sixth hearing , the defendant , his wife , and his brother-in-law were overly friendly , waving , smiling , and bidding us good luck . All the evidence which helped catch the mugger was offered : ( 1 ) description of car  --  year , type , color ; ( 2 ) license plate number ? one number off , M instead of W ; ( 3 ) $40 in the mugger 's pocket in the exact bills I reported missing ; ( 4 ) an autoharp pick ? he did not even know what an autoharp is ; ( 5 ) an almost exact approximation of his height and weight ; ( 6 ) accurate description of his clothing , etc . Other evidence was also given . The mugger was freed after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policeman . Last night on Channel 5 news , there was an item about the $1 rapist , who was finally caught after raping about 25 women in Queens . His name , Leroy Hamlin , the same man who had mugged me . I feel that if the judicial system were improved , my experience could have saved many women from being raped . Mr. Hamlin had several previous arrests , prior to mugging me . BETH SOFER Jamaica , N.Y. , April 1 , 1975 It is absurd to say they would have been represented in percentages approximating their percentage of the population . This is not so generally for ethnic , racial or social groups . Not all sorts of goals are quotas , but these are . The Berkeley Plan requires that university to hire 97 women , 20 blacks , 42 Asians , 10 Chicanos , 0 " native Americans " and 9 " others . " If these are not quotas , what are ? If a specific number of positions must be given to members of a restricted pool , then members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discrimination . It is illegal and immoral ; history shows that it is also dangerous . The proper remedy for unjust discrimination is equal application of the laws . Unfortunately H.E.W . pressure stampedes administrators who , trying to avoid the accusation of one sort of discrimination , practice another . Some who oppose quotas and reverse discrimination are not the very same tenured professors who were originally responsible for discrimination . Some of us do n't want a return to the status quo ante . Some of us want the end of discrimination . Some of us think that principle is at least as important as result . Some of us do n't want to take an eye for an eye . ( Assoc . Prof. ) BARRY R. GROSS York College , C.U.N.Y. New York , March 25 , 1975 The U.S. in Vietnam To the Editor : The sickening plan to salve our national guilt for the holocaust we visited on Vietnam by rapidly bringing war orphans to these shores has failed . Instead , American " superior technology " has murdered Vietnamese babies one last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash of the C-5A orphan jet . If we were really a humane people with a humane Government we would have aided Vietnam 's hundreds of thousands of orphans much earlier . We might have helped North Vietnam rebuild its hospitals , orphanages and schools , giving the aid we pledged to them in the peace agreement and then never gave . But we are not that kind of people . As the monk in the film " Hearts and Minds " said : " The Americans come here and say we are slant-eyed savages : But the Vietnamese have 2,000 years of history . It is not we who are savages . . . " The United States has refused to answer the NLF request for humanitarian aid of clothing , food , canned milk for the refugees in their areas . We will not help them put their ravaged country back together , help them feed the people caught in the chaos . We accede to the NLF 's hardwon right to govern the country , for we see we have lost the war . But the refugees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lost to Communism " are no longer important to us . Camn Ranh Bay is now " Communist " and so we will not make arrangements with the NLF to unload food and medicine there . How can we aid people whom we spent a decade killing , making freefire zones out of the areas controlled by the people who are soon to form the Government of . South Vietnam ? Exactly how phony our concern is for the Vietnamese people whose suffering we now witness daily will become clear when the PRG forms a new national administration in Saigon . That will be the , end , of the humanitarian aid , for the business of America is not to aid Communists , but to kill them . ROGER NEVILLE WILLIAMS New York , April 4 , 1975 Federal Funds and Abortion To the Editor : Paul Strohl Jr . approves Senator Bartlett 's proposal ( defeated today in the Senate 54 to 36 ) to ban Federal funds for abortion as implementing " the freedom of those Federal taxpayers who have no taste for subsidizing feticide " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not generalize the Bartlett proposal , and ban Federal funds for ( 1 ) blood transfusions , since Jehovah 's Witnesses have no taste for subsidizing them , and ( 2 ) all medical and hospital treatment , inasmuch as Christian Scientists have no taste for subsidizing them ? . Followed to its logical conclusion , the Bartlett approach would substitute , for the individual patient 's freedom of choice of treatment where Federal funds are needed to pay for it , a power to veto such choice by any religious group that objected to that form of treatment . By limiting this veto power to a single religious group  --  those within the Roman Catholic Church and their fellow travelers on this issue outside it who believe that a human person begins at conception ( a metaphysical fantasy rejected , in express terms , by the United States Supreme Court in 1973 and by the Italian Constitutional Court in 1975 ) ? Senator Bartlett betrays a profound misunderstanding of the value which the **29;710;TOOLONG clause of the First Amendment seeks to protect . To him , while all religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others . ( Prof. ) CYRIL C. MEANS Jr . New York Law School New York , April 10 , 1975 ? Pressure on Israel To the Editor : Is current United States pressure on Israel to make further concessions to an Egypt that is unwilling to renounce belligerency an example of what President Ford means by his press conference pledge that " We will stand by our allies . . . . " ? Many of us who opposed U.S. military intervention in Indochina recognize , nonetheless , that the political and military debacle there is a blow to American prestige and credibility . If it should be followed by cutting Israel adrift , what nation , indeed , will continue to place its faith in American pledges ? JOSEPH P. LASH New York , April 3 , 1975 ? The Liberal Mind To the Editor : Your editorial of March 28 on " The Tide of History " is a masterpiece of self-deceit and . wishful thinking  --  typical , alas , of the American liberal mind . I am not defending the Administration 's policies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patchwork , " they do not seem to exist . What amazes me , however , is your systematic failure to see that since World War II , Communist totalitarianism , whether monolithic or not , has been progressing in all parts of the world and this constitutes today the only discernible " tide of history " ; that once in power , Communism has never been dislodged , In spite of the innumerable voices reaching the West , in spite of all " Gulag Archipelagos , " the Western intelligentsia seem to remain unshakably faithful to the motto : " no enemies on the left .
