txt The Ford administration has moved another step forward in its two-pronged post-IndoChina policy of shoring up faltering alliances and of simultaneously warning potential foes or =troublemakers-not to underestimate U.S. tolerance of being pushed around . The next piece expected to fall into place in the shoring up of alliances is the Senate vote in Washington reversing the ban on U.S. aid to Turkey imposed by Congress last February in defiance of White House and State Department wishes . For the ban - to be lifted , the House would have to join the Senate in reversing itself . This may not come immediately , but the Senate vote alone could prove enough to sweeten the meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Turkish Government leaders at the Central Treaty Organization ( CENTO ) meeting in Ankara later this week . The latest tough warning from the administration came in an interview with Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger in the current edition of U.S. News &; World Report . In it two of the Secretary 's main thrusts were on : Korea : If North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the North Koreans " would have to conclude that the U.S. would take more vigorous action than we were inclined to take during much of the Vietnamese war . " One of the lessons of that war " is that rather than simply counter your . // *Ford aides try to hold U.S. alliance flanks // opponent 's thrusts , it is necessary to go for the heart of the opponent 's power . . . destroy his military forces . " A renewed Arab oil embargo : " I think , " Secretary Schlesinger said , " that we are less likely to be tolerant of a renewed embargo than we were in the initial one in 1973 . . . . I 'm not going to indicate any prospective reaction other than to point out there are economic , political , or conceivably military measures in response . " John Cooley reports from Beirut : Cairo and Beirut commentators led accounts of the Schlesinger remarks with lines like " new threat from the United States . " Some commentators here spoke of the U.S. advocating " piracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war brings a new oil embargo . I Diplomats here believe the Schlesinger statement may have especially serious consequences for the U.S. position in Saudi Arabia . Two months ago , before King Faisal 's murder , Secretary of State Kissinger publicly assured King Faisal and Oil Minister Zaki Yamani that talks of U.S. military intervention was only " irresponsible " newspaper speculation . I Simultaneously with the publication of ate Schlesinger interview , the North Korean radio put out a blistering attack on the U.S. , accusing it of " twaddling that it would observe and maintain " its military commitments to South Korea , or " penly making aggressive outbursts , " and of threatening " the use of nuclear weapons . " In his interview , incidentally , Mr. Schlesin ' ger spoke of the U.S. commitments to Japan and Taiwan ( so long as the U.S.-Taiwan security treaty was operative ) as well as to Korea as ones " perceived as something no one should challenge . " As for Secretary Kissinger 's mission to Ankara this week , it has been preceded by meetings in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss their disagreements on Cyrpus and underwater resources in the Aegean . They resolved nothing but did agree that their Prime Ministers should meet for further . talks during the NATO gathering in Brussels at the end of the month . On June 5 , talks are due to be resumed in Vienna between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot .. : ornmunity representatives . What Secretary Kissinger hopes is that Senate action on lifting the ban on U.S. aid to Turkey will be token enough for the Turkish Government to tell him in Ankara it will : ( 1 ) postpone if not drop any decision on the closing of U.S. bases in Turkey ; and ( 2 ) be more conciliatory towards Greeks and Greek Cypriots in the search for a Cyprus settlement .
