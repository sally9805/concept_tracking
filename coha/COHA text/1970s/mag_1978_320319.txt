Before setting off for the Crusades seven centuries ago , Louis IX of France ordered the kingdom 's bordellos closed . Uprooted but unfazed , many French prostitutes proceeded to join the Crusaders , traipsing along to the Holy Land as camp followers . Modern rulers have not had much better luck . When the French government cracked down on prostitution three years ago , the ladies of the night took sanctuary in churches . <P> Other European countries have learned to live more or less equably with the oldest profession . But in such matters the New World is less tolerant and straightforward than the Old . Although prostitution is officially a crime , the U.S. supports an estimated half-million hookers , while trying to put them out of business with an incredible hodgepodge of laws . Both in letter and spirit the laws entangle the states in ambiguous moral and constitutional questions , often with confusing results . <P> Just this month , for instance , New York began to apply its new " anti-john " law , imposing stiffer penalties for prostitutes ' clients ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equivalent of a traffic ticket . Early hauls have included a 69-year-old man from New Jersey , let off in deference to his age . Other offenders will not get off so lightly . For patronizing a prostitute under age 11 , the term can run as high as seven years . <P> The anti-john law is only the latest effort by New York to cut off the most baneful aspect of the trade-traffic in minors - and to get prostitutes off the street . The city is still trying to enforce , with some success , the stiff , two-year-old antiloitering law ( not coincidentally passed on the eve of the 1976 Democratic National Convention in New York City ) . Prostitution is somewhat less visible now . But the wording of the antiloitering law , which allows arrests for " repeated beckoning , " is claimed to be unconstitutional . Once upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals , the law is being tested again by the New York Civil Liberties Union . <P> Police trying to enforce it , at any rate , have swept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home from the movies and a church worker counseling prostitutes . Meanwhile , pimps , the most noxious corner of the prostitution triangle , often go untouched . Convicting them is difficult because prostitutes are frequently afraid to testify against them . The Manhattan district attorney 's office will use most of $200,000 it just received from the state for combating pimps to change the prostitutes ' minds and lives with protection and " travel home " money . <P> Chicago has also been zeroing in on pimps this year . Last year the emphasis was on customers , who were picked up at the rate of 40 a night . That campaign has been taken up by local volunteers who have formed the Broadway Hookers Patrol , roaming Chicago 's northeast side streets and shining flashlights in the faces of embarrassed johns and copying down their license plate numbers . Out in Joliet , Ill. , the local paper hopes to cut down on the trade by printing the names of arrested johns . Included thus far on the Joliet list : a priest and a judge .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
