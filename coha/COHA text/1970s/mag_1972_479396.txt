IF I WERE A VISITOR from another planet , I I would say things like this about the people of the United States in 1972 : " These are ferocious creatures who imagine that they are gentle . They have experimented in very recent times with slavery and genocide . " I would call the robbing and killing of American Indians genocide . I would say , " The two real political parties in America are the Winners and the Losers . The people do not acknowledge this . They claim membership in two imaginary parties , the Republicans and the Democrats , instead . " Both imaginary parties are bossed by Winners . When Republicans battle Democrats , this much is certain : Winners will win . " The Democrats have been the larger party in the past ? because their leaders have not been as openly contemptuous of Losers as the Republicans have been . " Losers can join imaginary parties . Losers can vote . " LUSERS HAVE THOUSANDS of religions , often of the bleeding heart variety , " I would go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of Darwinism , which argues that it is the will of the universe that only the fittest should survive . " The most pitiless Darwinists are attracted to the ReptilIfican party , which regularly purges itself of suspected bleeding hearts . it is in the process now of isolating and ejecting Representative Paul N. McCloskey , for instance , who has openly raged and even wept about the killing and maiming of Vietnamese . " The Vietnamese are impoverished farmers , far , far away . The Winners in America have had them bombed and shot day in and day out , for years on end . This is not madness or foolishness , as some people have suggested . It is a way for the Winners to learn how to be pitiless . They under stand that the material resources of the plane arc almost exhausted , and that pity will soon b , a form of suicide . " The Winners are rehearsing for Things t ( Come . " HERE IS A WITTY WINNER , a millionaire I named William F. Buckley , Jr. , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am on television . He bickers amusingly with peopl , who think that Winners should help the Loser more than they do . " He has a nearly permanent and always pa tronizing rictus when debating . " As a visitor from another planet . I would hay , nothing to lose socially in supposing that Buck ley himself did not know the secret message o his smile . I would then guess at the message " Yes , oh yes , my dear man I understand wha you have said so clumsily . But you must know your heart what every Winner knows : that on must behave heartlessly toward Losers , if on hopes to survive . " That may not really be the message in th Buckley smile . But I guarantee you that it wa the monolithic belief that underlay the Repuk Bean National Convention in Miami Beach Florida , in 1972 . All the rest was hokum . L ISTEN : I went to a private luncheon for Winner in Miami Beach , while the convention was far ing around several miles away . Nelson Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . William F. Buckley , Jr. , was there . Artlit , 0 . Sulzberger was there . Jacob Javits was then Claire Booth Luce was there . Art Buchwald wa there . Barbara Walters was there . Everybod was there . Whether one was a Republican or a Democrat was a hilarious accident , which nobody was required to explain . I asked Dr. Galbraith what he was doing at a Republican Convention . He replied that he had been offered an indecent amount of money to banter with Buckley in the morning on NBC . Barbara Walters invited me to appear on the Today show . I told her that I had nothing to say . The convention had left me speechless . It was so heavily guarded , spiritually and physically , that I had n't been able to see or bear anything that was n't already available in an official press release " It 's Disneyland under martial law , " said . " You do n't have to say much , " she said . " I 'd have to say something , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Hello . Art Buchwald said he came to the convention in order to see his pals , mostly other news people . He told our table about a column he had just written . The comical premise was that the Republican party had attracted so many campaign : : ontributions that it found itself with two billion dollars it could n't spend . It decided to buy some.hing nice for the American people . Here was the rift : a free week 's bombing of Vietnam . I asked Claire Booth Luce what she thought of ; ome young people 's efforts to stimulate pity for : he people of Vietnam . They had been dressing is Vietnamese there in Miami Beach , and carryng dolls that were painted to look as though hey had been disemboweled and burned alive and so on . Mrs. Luce wished the young people would take in automobile and till it with something resemding blood . She said she had lost two members of ier family in automobile accidents . Automobiles vere easily the most terrible killers of our times , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Nixon versus McGovern thing : , everybody was sure that Nixon would win . Me ; overn , I gathered , though nobody said so out oud , was the butt of a rather elegant practical oke . He was a Winner who had been encouraged . y other Winners to identify himself with Losers , o bury himself up to his neck in the horseshit of ' opulism , so to speak . Losers hate to vote for Losers . They know hat Losers are . So Nixon would win . W HAT REMAINED to be discovered at the convention was , among other things , how inch pity Republicans as individuals felt for le Vietnamese . and for Americans who were adly housed and badly nourished and so on . The scientific conclusion is that there was a itisfactory level of pity when the delegates wereordinary social creatures , more or less in isolation and at rest , when majestic policies were not being promulgated in thundering meetings , when the delegates were not threatened by hostile crowds . But there was a Pavlovian thing going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now : the wishes of the hostile crowds were invariably humanitarian , and the crowds were n't even hostile most of the time . But wherever they went , armies of policemen went too ? to protect nice people from them . So a Pavlovian connection has been made in the minds of people who are really awfully nice : when more than two people show up with a humanitarian idea , the police should be called . F THE POLICE DO N'T ACT immediately , and if I the humanitarians behave in a manner that is dignified or beautiful or heartbreaking , there is still something nice people can do . They can ignore the humanitarians . This is what the nice people did when one of the most honorable military reviews in American history took place on the afternoon of August 22 , 1972 , in front of the Hotel Fontainebleau . This date will not go down in history , because nice people do not want it there . Several hundred American gunfighters , killers from the war in Vietnam , formed themselves into platoons , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spooky rags of modern jungle warfare . They marched silently , in the slope-shouldered route step of tired , hungry veterans ? which they were . Their hair was often long , which gave them the cavalier beauty of Indian killers from another time . Some were in wheelchairs . Many had wounds . John Wayne , the gunfighter 's gunfighter , was in Miami Beach somewhere . But he was nowhere to he seen when these real gunfighters came to town . Here was Billy the Kid , multiplied by a thousand ? not even whispering , and formed into platoons before the Fontainebleau . They sat down silently , which was a crime . They were blocking a public thoroughfare . Some sighed . Some scratched themselves . Their message was this : " Let the killing stop . " They went home again . How many nice people came out of the hotel or came to hotel windows to watch them ? None ? almost none . It was a police affair . A FOR THE NONSENSICAL BUSINESS to be per-formed by run-of-the-mill delegates : it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to eminent theologians pray , of getting autographs , of recoiling from hostile crowds . Saul Steinberg , the most intelligent artist of our time , should have covered it for The New Y other , along with Renata Adler and Richard Rovere . It was all clouds and curlicues . As for the prayers : I heard a lot of famous Republicans and eminent theologians pray at a Worship Service on the Sunday before the convention began . That is another date I would like to see go into American history books : August 20 , 1972 . In a moment , I will explain why it belongs there . I listened closely to all the preaching and praying . I wanted to learn , if I could . what the Republican God was shaped like . I came away with this impression : lie was about the size of Mount Washington , and very slow to anger . There were a lot of little sermons , but the main one was delivered , at the request of Richard M. Nixon himself , by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Richmond , Indiana . Earlharn , like Whittier College where Mr. Nixon went to school , is a Quaker school . Dr. Trueblood 's sermon surprised me at one point , because I thought I heard him say that the sovereignty exercised by American politicians came directly from God . Some other reporters there got the same impression . He was speaking extemporaneously , so no copies of the sermon were made available for a detailed check . But I interviewed him afterwards , and recorded our conversation , which went like this : " After your sermon this morning , " I said , " I heard someone say that you had traced sovereignty from the President directly to God . We are usually taught that the sovereignty of the President resides in the people . I was wondering since you are a theologian " I said nothing about the President , " sai ' Trueblood . " I said the sovereignty is God 's , no ours , that all we do is under Judgment . This is way to have a non-idolatrous patriotism . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if we were to lay it out like a wiring diagram the President draws his sovereignty from th people , and the people draw it from God . Is tha it ? " " No , " he said . " I would put it another way that God alone is sovereign . I accept Luther ' doctrine of the two kingdoms of the Church an State , both under God . So that everything we d , as a state is under Judgment , therefore deriya tive . " " So the President is simultaneously respor sible to the people and to God ? " " But even more to God than to the people , 43 course , " Dr. Trueblood replied . I set this down so meticulously and withou elisions because I think it proves my claim tha on August 20 , 1972 , the Republican Natiom Convention was opened with a sermon on th Divine Right of Presidents . Of water commissioners too . TOLD DR. ratiEntmou that I thought Quake " I were pacifists and that I was startled by th energy with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecute a war . He said I had a simplistic notion about win-Quakerism was , that a lot of Americans die " Why , " lie said , " when I go around on speakin engagements , they all expect me to look like th man on the box of Quaker Oats . " " So , at this stage of American history , Qual ers are an awful lot like everybody else ? " I sill gested . Dr. Trueblood agreed heartily . " And we an just as mixed up as everybody else , " he assure me . " And anybody that believes in a single pa tern of Quaker , he is just plain stupid . " I said to him that many peace-loving peop ' must know that he had the ear of the Preside ' and that they must have told him , " My God , D Trueblood , tell him to stop the war , " " Yes , " he said , " and often in a most ' last mood , very judgmental sometimes . And I say I them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Don hinder him in your self-righteousness . ' I don take any lip off them , you understand . " And this Quaker philosopher had even heavii news than that for the bleeding hearts . He wi about to send to the President a little-know quotation from Abraham Lincoln , with who Mr. Nixon in his wartime anguish identifies . This was it : We are indeed going through a great trial , a fiery trial . In the very responsible position in which I happen to be placed , being an humble instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father , as I am and as we all are , to work out His great purposes I have decided that all my works and acts may be according to His Will . And , that it might be so , I have sought His aid . But if , after endeavoring to do my best in the life which He affords me , I find my efforts jail , I must believe that , for some purpose unknown to me , He wills it otherwise . I f I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced . I f I had been allowed my way , this war would have ended before this . But we find that it still continues , and we must believe that He permits it for some wise purpose of His Own , mysterious and unknown to us ; and though , with our limited understanding , we are not able to comprehend it , yet we can not but believe that He Who made the world still governs it . I hate to think of this document 's falling into the President 's hands . I am persuaded that Mr. Nixon , in his splendid humorlessness , does not understand that he is implementing the harsh , long-term survival plans of the Winners as opposed to the Losers , of the fat people versus the thin . It seems entirely possible to me , now that I have learned for sure that his spiritual advisers are so appallingly commonplace , that he honestly believes that he is serving God , no matter what he does . Iv- I WERE A VISITOR from another planet , by I the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice toward Losers : I would say that it was because his family was poor during the Great Depression and it was a humiliation to them to be lumped with other poor people . ft was as though the Nixons had all been locked up in a dog pound by mistake . The President nuw demonstrates that he ca n't stand anything about the poor people with whom he was so unjustly associated so long ago . +T MEE REPUBLICANS WERE AS HIGH as kites at their convention , of course , since victory was a certainty . The enemy candidate was buried up to his neck in Populism , whereas their own candidate was buried up to his neck in God . Nothing remained to he done , so autographing parties starring the President 's wife and daughters loomed large on the official schedules for every lay . These pleasant , pretty women were modest ind shy . They seemed to say with body fan ; uage : " You should be getting the autographs of iome of the really famous movie stars around . " Who were some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ethel Merman was one . CO I STEPPED OUT OF an elevator at the Fon- tainebleau on the third day of the convention . I myself was now giving out autographs . I had actually given one to a rioter while a riot was going on . I was also building a respectable collection of prayers and sermons . I had just picked up a mimeographed copy of what George G. Seibels , Jr. , the mayor of Birmingham , Alabama , had said on the same program with Dr. Trueblood on Sunday . Mayor Seibels himself had just handed it to me , and it was all written in capital letters . " I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU ACCORD ME THIS SIGNAL HONOR IN BRINGINC YOU A MESSAGE ' ONE NATION UNDER COD , ' " it began , " A SUBJECT VERY DEAR TO ME AND MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS OF ALL CREEDS , COLORS . AND RACES . SO APPROPRIATE IT IS THAT ON THIS SABBATH DAY WE COMMENCE OUR CONVENTION ACTIVITIES WITH THIS WORSHIP SERVICE . " I now accosted one of the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . They were living proof that young people were crazy about Mr. Nixon . I had heard them cry out their admiration for Ethel Merman at a party for celebrities and youth urn the afternoon before . " 1 am from Harper 's Magazine , " I said , " and I would like to ask you if you think an atheist could possibly he a good President of the United States . " " I do n't see how , " she said . " Why not ? " I said . " Well ? " she said , this whole country is founded on God . " " Could a Jew be a good President ? " I asked . " I do n't know enough about that to say , " she replied . This was a white child . I tore my eyes away from her reluctantly , and what did I see ? I saw ten American Indians sitting all by themselves on overstuffed furniture in the lobby . Nine were big male Indians . One was an Indian boy . Those Indians seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not swivel their heads around to see who was who . They had a coffee table all to themselves . On it were mimeographed copies of a message they had come great distances to deliver . They were from many tribes . As I would later discover , the message was addressed as follows : " Att'n : Richard M. Nixon , President U.S.A. " The message said this in part : " We come today in such a manner that must shame God himself . For a country which allows a complete body of people to exist in conditions which are at variance with the ideals of this country , conditions which daily commit injustices and inhumanity , must surely be filled with hate , greed , and unconcern . " DID NOT co DIRECTLY to the Indians . I chatted I first with a reporter friend . He told me a thing that Dr. Daniel Ellsberg , who had made the Pentagon Papers public , had said about Dr. Henry Kissinger , the President 's strikingly happy adviser on foreign affairs . This was it : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought that was a ravishing remark . Ells-berg was at the convention , incidentally . Nobody seemed to notice him , even though he stood for everything good Republicans considered treacherous and vile . This was because he looked so much like just another security man . I told my friend that I had watched Dr. Kissinger on television , while he made gifts of Dutch uncle smiles and autographs to a pair of little girls in white organdy . I was glad that Ellsberg brought up the subject of Mephistopheles , because the scene had seemed definitely evil to me . Little girls represent life at its most playful and promising , I said , And anybody in Dr. Kissinger 's job had a lot to do with random , pointless deaths in Vietnam these days ? even deaths of little girls in white on our side . So evil came with the job . Under the circumstances , I found it ugly that a man in such a job would give out Dutch uncle smiles and autographs . NOW GLIMPSED ABM ; HOFFMAN , the clowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozenth time that day by security men , who looked just like Dr. Ellsberg . He was a weary clown by now . His press credentials were in order . He was gathering material for a book . " Who you representing ? " he was asked . " Field and Stream , " he said . I had the feeling he was n't going to be clowning much more . A lot of naturally funny people who want to help Losers are n't going to clown anymore . They have caught on that clowning does n't throw off the timing or slow down cruel social machinery . In fact , it usually serves as a lubricant . Every so often somebody tells me that it is a delicious fact of history that clowns have often been the most effective revolutionaries . That is n't true . Cruel social machines in the past have needed clowns for lubrication so much that they have often manufactured them . Consider the Spanish Inquisition . When the inquisition was about to burn somebody alive in a public square , it shaved that person from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of babbling idiocy , fitted him out with a conical hat and a lurid paper cloak . His or her face was painted or masked . I ley presto ! A clown ! The idea , of course , was to make the victim comical rather than pitiful . Pity is like rust to a cruel social machine . DO NOT SAY THAT America 's Winners are I about to burn America 's Losers in public squares ? although , if they did , it would be nothing new . I say that the Winners are avid to neglect the Losers , which is cruelty too . And neglecting becomes easier , if only the victims or people who seem to represent them will look like clowns . If clownish-looking people had n't conic to Miami Beach to raise hell with the convention , there still would have been plenty of clowns in the cartoons and prose in campaign literature floating around ? jackbooted lesbians , mincing male homosexuals , drug crazed hippies , prostitutes on their way to the unemployment office in Cadillacs , big fat black mamas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Monday , an official party publication : " Yippie leader Jerry Rubin , a backer of Sen. George McGovern , ' no longer ' believes that people should kill their parents to demonstrate their dedication to change . " And so on . And those Indians in the lobby of the Fontainebleau were moving so little , were saying too little because their people were dying of neglect . and they knew damn well that even if they sneezed , this would allow some people to dismiss them as clowning redskins . So now they were in danger of becoming comical because of their petrified dignity . rilHESE INDIANS HAD BEEN harrowingly de- ' feated by white men in greedy . unjust wars . They had been offered death or unconditional surrender ? death , or life under hideous conditions . Those who had chosen life , which some people think is a holy thing , asked for mercy now . Their average life expectancy was only forty-six years . Their babies died with sickening regularity . Their water rights had been stolen . Some of their best men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools were indifferent to Indian ideas of holiness , and so were the white man 's laws of the land . One of the things the Indians had come to beg from President Nixon , who never hegged anything from anybody , was that their religions be recognized as respectable religions under law . As the law now stands , they told me , their religions are negligible superstitions deserving no respect . I 'll say this : their religions could n't possibly be more chaotic than the Christianity reinvented every day by Dr. I ) . Elton Trueblood , Professor at Large . rr HE INDIAN I TALKED TO MOST was Ron I Petite , a Chippewa . He said that he and the others had come from all over the country to Flamingo Park in Miami Beach , where Losers and friends of Losers had caused a tent city to be built . They moved right out again , disgusted and frightened by clowns . They went to the Hollywood Indian Reservation , a few miles north of Miami , where Indian notions of sacredness and dignity were respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white youth who was willing to set a flag on fire and piss on it as a surrogate for oppressed people everywhere . R ON PETITE TOLD a very funny Indian story without cracking a smile . He and the others came into the Fontainebleau with their message to Mr. Nixon , and nobody of any importance would take it from them . They were ignored . But then they saw people forming into lines . The President 's daughters were going to give out autographs . So the Indians got into line too , and patiently waited their turn . Indians are legendary for patience . When they arrived at last before Patricia or Julie ? they were n't sure which they gave her a message for Dad . ND HER DAD WOULD SAY in his acceptance speech that night , among other things , " We covet no one else 's territory . We seek no dominion over any other people . We seek peace not only for ourselves but for all the peoples in the world . " This was what he had said on Russian television in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to say that this was only kind of true . I think of all the Winners at that private party for Winners I went to , and how they like to live , and what good care they take of their financial affairs . They want to go anywhere on the planet and live however they please , buy whatever they please . What could be more human than that ? They want to be planetary aristocrats , welcomed everywhere . Again : what could be more human than that ? What seems to charm them as much as anything about the rapprochement with China is that they may soon be able to travel there again . That charms me too . If we really liked some part of China , we might want to put up a little house there , or a motel ? or a Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise . We do n't covet anybody 's territory . We would just like to buy or rent some of it , if we can ? and then everybody can get rich . If I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would n't call Americans Americans . I would give them a name that told a lot about them immediately : I would call them Regltors . WOULD CALL the Republicans Super-Realtors . I I would call the Democrats Inferior Realtors . And one thing that fascinated me about the Super-Realtors ' Worship Service on Sunday was that Colonel Frank Borman was on the bill . He looked as tired of space opera as Abbie Hoffman was of clowning . He did his bit , which was to read about the Creation from Genesis , and that was that . At no point in the Super-Realtors ' Convention was there any Kennedy-style boosterism about the glorious opportunities for Americans in outer space . Since there were plenty of Republicans at the convention who were dumb enough to believe that McGovern was really an enthusiast for acid , amnesty , and abortion , I am free to think that they were dumb enough at one point to hope that nice properties might be had for a song on the Moon . They had sent some good Republicans up there to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray and hit a few golf balls , and they knew better now . Not even Losers , with all their lazy resourcefulness , could survive on the Moon . So it was time to think hardheaded thoughts about efficient use of the surface of the Earth again . And why not make friends again with our old friends , the Chinese ? 66 IT WAS PERHAPS UNKIND OF ME to associate Dr. Kissinger with evil . That is no casual thing to do in a country as deeply religious as ours is . As the mayor of Birmingham told us about Our nation on Sunday , - WITH ALL OUR LABORS . SUCCESS OR FAILURE , NOW AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD IT WILT ? GOD WILLING , ALWAYS BE ONE NATION UNDER GOD . ' " Dr. Kissinger , after all , has been a healer of terrible wounds between the mightiest nations of all . But the Administration he serves is bad news for those nations that are feeble , or what the King James version of the Bible calls " the meek . " The Super-Realtors. with Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the few other truly terrifying powers of the planet as to what can be done and what must not he done with the real estate of the meek . The Nixon-Kissinger scheme , the Winners ' scheme , the neo-Metternichian scheme for lasting world peace is simple . Its basic axiom is to he followed by individuals as well as great nations , by Losers and Winners alike . We have demonstrated the workability of the axiom in Vietnam , in Bangladesh , in Biafra , in Palestinian refugee camps , in our own ghettos , in our migrant labor camps , on our Indian reservations , in our institutions for the defective and the deformed and the aged . This is it : ignore agony . M Y CLOSE FRIEND Dexter Leen , who is a shoe merchant in Hyannis on Cape Cod , used to read the New York Times every Sunday , and then come over to my house and tell me that , on the basis of what lie had read in there , things were slowly but surely getting better all the time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile drivers we had known . He knew one woman , back in the days when all ears had radiator ornaments , who never took her eyes off her radiator ornament , he said . And looking at one day 's news or a few days ' news or a few years ' news is a lot like staring at the radiator ornament of a Stutz Bearcat , it seems to me . Which is why so many of us would love to have a visitor from another planet , who might have a larger view of our day-to-day enterprises , who might be able to give us some clue as to what is really going on . He would tell us , I think , that no real Winner fears God or believes in a punitive afterlife . He might say that Earthlings put such emphasis on truthfulness in order to be believed when they lie . President Nixon , for instance , was free to lie during his acceptance speech at the convention , if he wanted to , because of his famous love for the truth . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything else was hokum . HE MIGHT CONGRATUT.ATE US for learning so much about healing the planet , and warn us against wounding the planet so horribly during our real estate dealings , that it might never heal . The visitor might say by way of farewell what Charles Darwin seemed to say to us , and we might write his words in stone , all in capital letters , Iike the words of the mayor of Birming-ham :
