It is Saturday evening of a hard campaign week , and the candidate is tired . His expressive hands play with thick budgetary studies by the Brookings Institution that lie on the coffee table before him . Scattered at his feet are books that he has had little time for recently : Thomas Merton on Zen , Arnold Toynbee on the future , Idries Shah on Sufi parables . As the twilight fades , the soothing voice of Judy Collins drifts through the room from the hi-fi in the corner : " ' Cause she 's touched your perfect body with her mind . " <P> But the candidate is tense . He is not getting his point across to a listener . Finally he interrupts the questions . " Is it a liberal program ? Is it a conservative program ? It 's my program . I 'm consistent with myself . I do n't have to fit some predetermined mold . " <P> Largely because he has refused to fit someone else 's predetermined mold , Edmund G. ( " Jerry " ) Brown Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorite to win the Nov. 5 election and succeed Ronald Reagan as Governor of California . In any circumstances , Brown would be a strikingly unusual candidate , points out TIME Correspondent Richard Duncan . A tense and introverted intellectual , Brown spent four years in a Jesuit seminary ( " It concentrates your thinking , " he says with a half-smile ) and cracks jokes in Latin for his press entourage . He has been a follower of Eugene McCarthy and Cesar Chavez , made money as a corporation lawyer , studied Gandhi and Thomas a Kempis , dated Liv Ullmann and Natalie Wood . He is a public man with private layers that are concealed from even his closest friends . <P> But for all his contradictions and complexities , what makes Brown such a salable commodity this election year is the fact that he is so well attuned to the politics of 1974-to voters disillusioned and ultimately bored by Watergate , frustrated and angered by inflation , wary of and irritated with most politicians . As Brown freely admits , he would not be running for Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 36 , after only five years in public life , if his father were not Edmund G. <P> ( " Pat " ) Brown , California 's Governor from 1959 to 1966 , and the man who seemingly ended Richard Nixon 's political career in 1962 by crushing him in a race for the governorship . But Jerry Brown is out from under Pat Brown 's considerable shadow now and has established himself as his own man with his own views . That is the bedrock requirement for any candidate in a major election this year . Across the country , Republicans and Democrats alike are struggling to convince jaded voters not simply that they are bright and capable candidates but , perhaps even more important , that they are independent , honest and practical as well . <P> Possible Debacle . Cursed by the sins of Nixon and Watergate and blamed for inflation , the Republicans , of course , are having the hardest time establishing their credibility . Their party faces a possible debacle at the polls .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
