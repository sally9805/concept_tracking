Last May I finally gave in , and on my way to the Florida Keys for a couple of months of tarpon fishing I stopped at a Miami custom rod-building shop and bought a graphite fly-rod blank . Like almost every other fisherman , I had heard a lot about graphite  --  good and bad  --  in the six or so years since the rods had become generally available , and I felt it was high time to try one out myself . I was looking for a rod that would handle a light saltwater fly line , about a No. 9 , something suitable for bonefish and permit . John Emery , an expert in tackle design , chose a nine-foot two-piece blank for me , along with a set of low-friction aluminum oxide guides . He also loaned me a heavier graphite rod , which he had made up for tarpon. // John 's taste in tarpon rods runs a good deal heavier than mine , and what he handed me was indeed a formidable weapon , for launching a heavy No. 13 line into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air there in the shop , and it was extremely stiff , as graphite tends to be , but since graphite rods are also considerably smaller in diameter than their fiber-glass equivalents , it was surprisingly light . John told me to go ahead and try the rod for about a week , then pass it on to Bob Montgomery , an accomplished Key West guide and fly-fisherman. // As I was on my way out the door , admiring the beautiful workmanship that had gone into the tarpon rod , I said , " I sure hope it does n't break . " I was thinking of what I had heard about graphite blanks snapping for no apparent reason , like the time a boy had broken one while casting with a demonstration model at a tackle convention . " Do n't worry about it , " John assured me . " If it breaks , it breaks . Put all the pressure on it you want . That 's what it 's for . " // A couple of mornings later I was staked out in my skiff on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide was beginning to drop and a friend and I were waiting for the tarpon to swim out of a basin where they had spent the night feeding . We had good visibility and were able to see the first school while it was still 100 yards away . The fish were stretched out in a long single file , at least 15 of them . When they had approached to within about 40 feet , my partner delivered the fly nicely to the lead fish . The tarpon inhaled it without breaking stride , but on the first jump he threw the fly . // Then it was my turn . I decided to give Emery 's big graphite tarpon rod a try while I was still fresh . As I stood on the casting platform waiting for an opportunity to present itself , I practiced casting with the stiff nine-footer . Although I had just come from three months of guiding in the Bahamas , poling the flats almost every day , my wrists felt barely strong enough to control the rod properly . Even so , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire fly line . I had a glass rod in the boat that would do the same thing with a slightly smaller No. 11 line , but it should be remembered that I was unaccustomed to the feel of graphite with its very fast recovery and stiff backbone ; my timing was geared to the slower action of glass . I wondered what the results would be after a steady month of fishing with the big rod , when my wrists would be strong enough to cope with the pressure and my timing trimmed to get everything the graphite had to offer . Even on those first casts I was impressed with the rod 's quick recovery , which smooths out the waves always present to some extent in a hard-thrown fly line . // However , another property of graphite that I had heard about concerned me . Because it does n't have the elasticity of glass , what would be the proportion of breakoffs on the strike ? I am accustomed to hooking hard-mouthed tarpon by striking them very hard . It is a habit I 've gotten into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods , but it is this same give that leaves plenty of room for error on the fisherman 's part . As long as an angler lets the rod do the striking and does not neutralize the built-in spring effect of a glass rod by yanking on the line itself while holding the rod practically horizontal , there is relatively little chance of breaking a 12-pound tippet . But with the stiffer action of graphite ... ? // My chance to find out came when we spotted a single fish hugging the bank as he swam in our direction . He looked to be about 50 pounds , a size at which tarpon make their most spectacular jumps . Like the first fish we had seen , this one took the fly readily . From the time I started to cast I had concentrated on the fish ; the mechanics of the cast and the strike went unnoticed , which is the way it should be . The hook-up was a good one , with no problem at all , and as the tarpon made six silvered jumps I realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphite . It was a feeling of control . // The initial 75-yard run ended in another jump ; then it was time for me to begin the real fight . I found I could lean back hard on the rod and exert strong pressure on the fish . Had I been using a glass rod , I would have been fighting a long belly of line as well as a hyper-active tarpon . Instead , my line was almost straight from rod tip to fish . Within about eight minutes , a remarkably short time , I had the tarpon on its side next to the boat and my friend was able to reach out with a pair of cutters and clip off the fly . It was gratifying to see the tarpon swim away strong and fresh , not stagger off totally spent and defenseless as often happens after a longer fight . // Both of us fought several more fish that day , using graphite and glass rods . Because the graphite was so stiff , we were more comfortable casting with the glass rod ; however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly preferred the graphite . // The following day I turned the graphite rod over to Bob Montgomery for one of his guests to use . Three days later I was staked on a flat when Montgomery came poling over . When he got near he held up a broken fly rod . It took me a second to realize that it was the same rod that I had used . " What happened ? " I yelled . " He broke it on a fish , " said Bob , gesturing toward his guest . I did n't pursue it any further , figuring the fisherman had probably done something stupid and was embarrassed enough as it was . Later , when I got a chance to talk with Montgomery alone , he told me his guest had been doing a good job fighting a tarpon , but the rod had broken for seemingly no reason where his left hand had been gripping it above the cork handle . Looking for a possible cause , I asked , " What pound tippet was he using ? " " Twelve ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is just not possible to put very much strain on a rod , particularly a strain sudden enough to cause a glass rod to collapse . // Needless to say , I was more than a little disappointed . I 'd just spent about $80 for my own graphite blank , guides , reel seat and other components and would invest five hours of labor putting them together . Now it seemed very possible to me that the rod would inexplicably self-destruct when put to the test . // A couple of weeks after the broken-rod episode , I was on the flats with my new graphite rod , the lighter bonefish-permit model . It felt like a toy in my hands , but the way it banged out a line quickly won my respect . The base of the blank was little more than half the diameter of an equivalent glass rod and yet I could easily throw the entire fly line with a single false cast . And , unlike the way it was with the larger tarpon outfit , timing was no longer a problem , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In only one respect did I remain disappointed . I still could not achieve the fantastic distances that others had ascribed to graphite . Under the best of circumstances I could shoot the entire line plus 10 feet into the backing 100 feet , certainly no more . Nor since that time , having used half a dozen different graphite rods , have I or any of my fellow guides really been able to cast an appreciably greater distance . Where graphite does surpass glass , without question , is in its ability to subdue a fish more quickly , and to shave an important second or two off the delivery time of the fly to the fish , which on saltwater flats can be very important . On salmon or steelhead water the relatively light graphite rod ( about 25% lighter than a fiber-glass rod rated for the same weight line ) allows the angler to make repeated distance casts without suffering the arm-wearying weight of glass or bamboo . // But on that first day on the flats with my just-completed graphite rod , repeated casts produced another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key West , yet I came across a huge school of three-and four-pounders . As I drifted before a light breeze , I quickly caught three of these fish , but while casting to a fourth I noticed the rod seemed a little wobbly . When I struck the fish the rod definitely bent in an uneven arc . On inspection I discovered that the ferrule joining the two sections of the rod had cracked . The graphite nemesis had struck again . This time it was n't too serious . I simply reinforced the female ferrule with wrapping thread and varnished it . Since that time almost a year has elapsed and the rod has proved itself on a number offish , including a 14-pound permit , with no further trouble . More important , it has become my favorite outfit . // But I have not become a zealot of graphite . First , they are fragile when compared with the present generation of glass rods . A nick that would do little harm in the comparatively thick wall of a glass blank is often enough to collapse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly rod sells for around $50 , but its graphite equivalent runs three to four times as high . In time the price will probably come down as more and more manufacturers produce the graphite blanks , but right now the angler who has to check the tag may have trouble justifying the price relative to the performance . And as more companies enter the field the buyer will be at the mercy of the manufacturer in another respect . Obviously , a rod with a surface nick in its black finish should be avoided , but there is no way to spot internal flaws ( graphite rods are composed of strands of the material running longitudinally , and damage to these long strands is thought to be the primary cause of breakage ) and in the end the reputation of the manufacturer is about all one can go on . // From my own experience I feel the fly-casting neophyte is likely to be most vulnerable to what may be excessive praise for graphite , although spinning rods , bait-casting and even surf-casting rods are also now available in graphite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance to an unskilled fly-fisherman 's cast , but it is likely to come at the expense of timing , and in the end this type of shortcut can not be justified . Despite a lot of publicity saying just the opposite , my experience has been that a good fly-caster will seldom achieve greater distance with graphite than with glass , but he will find that the degree of effort required to get the same results is substantially reduced , and that can be a substantial benefit . // At this stage I consider a graphite rod something of an indulgence and one in which the level of the angler 's skill should be realistically appraised before he takes the plunge .
