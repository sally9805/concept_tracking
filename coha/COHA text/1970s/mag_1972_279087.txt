Like the variations on some tricky gambit , the moves in Reykjavik , Iceland , last week were wild , wicked and just plain wearying . First , World Chess Champion Boris Spassky of the U.S.S.R. requested and was granted a two-day postponement of the 14th game in his title match with Bobby Fischer of the U.S. Bobby , never one to miss an opening , immediately filed a formal protest , charging that Boris ' excuse of " not feeling well " was too " vague and indefinite " to justify a delay . Actually , Fischer was just twisting the knife , for he and everyone else in Reykjavik could easily diagnose Spassky 's complaint . Behind 8-5 in the best-of-24-games match , the champion was understandably suffering from an advanced case of the blahs . <P> When the 14th game finally got under way , however , Fischer temporarily restored Spassky 's spirits . As Bobby made his 21st move , U.S. Grand Master Larry Evans , who was following the play on a pocket chess set in the press room of the Reykjavik Sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundered ! He 's dead lost ! " Sure enough , Spassky forced an exchange of pieces that left Fischer a pawn behind and in dire straits . Then , just as shockingly , Boris committed a far more obvious blunder on his 27th move . " They 've gone to pieces ! It 's like they 're playing on brennevin ! " exclaimed one grand master , referring to the potent Icelandic drink that the locals fondly call " Black Death . " Fischer 's second , the Rev. William J. Lombardy , a Catholic priest and a grand master , concurred . Following the game , which plodded on to an inevitable draw after 40 moves , he observed : " They played like two drunks . " <P> The action away from the board was just as hectic . In yet another formal protest , Fischer called the Icelandic Chess Federation and Chief Referee Lothar Schmid " arrogant and inconsiderate " for not complying with his demands to reduce spectator noise and remove the first seven rows of seats . ( Officials patiently replied that the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match and that they had taken such precautions as forbidding the sale of noisy , cellophane-wrapped candies in the hall . ) A little later , Film Producer Chester Fox got into the act ; he announced that he was suing Fischer for $1.5 million to cover the losses incurred from Fischer 's refusal to allow the match to be filmed . <P> The 15th game proved a refreshing respite from the week 's extracurricular infighting . Fischer , playing black , again fell behind in the early going . Then , beginning with a daring pawn sacrifice on his 28th move , he engaged Spassky in a furious battle that equalized their forces . Playing brilliantly under fire , Spassky countered with a checkmating threat that after 43 moves forced each player to accept one-half point for a draw . That gave Fischer a 9-6 lead ( he needs 12 points to win the match , Spassky needs 12 ) and led Arpad Elo , official statistician for the World Chess Federation , to make a prediction : if each contestant continues to play at the present level of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 27 , and Bobby Fischer will be the new world champion .
