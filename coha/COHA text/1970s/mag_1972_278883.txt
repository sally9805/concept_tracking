President Richard Nixon first invited Luis Echeverria , the President of Mexico , to visit Washington back in 1970 , but not until this spring was the trip firmly scheduled . Echeverria 's countrymen interpreted the delay as just one more sign that Latin America ranks disgracefully low on Washington 's scale of priorities . The Mexicans were doubly miffed last December when Nixon described Brazil , a military dictatorship but economically booming , as a model for Latin America . When the White House let it be known that Nixon would give Echeverria some moon rocks on his visit to the U.S. last week , Mexico City 's Excelsior sniffed that a few rocks were hardly a substitute for a discussion of " grave problems , old and new . " <P> Last week 's visit did not begin well . <P> The signing of a U.S.-Mexican agreement to try to eradicate the screwworm - which ravages cattle on both sides of the border-had to be delayed because U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz was out of town . More important , Washington seemed disinclined to honor its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , which leaves much of the soil of Mexico 's Mexicali Valley cracked and covered with white cakes of salt . <P> Unlike most Latin American visitors , Echeverria spoke bluntly . The pollution of the Colorado , he told a joint session of Congress , was " an unacceptable form of discrimination " against his country . Mexicans , he insisted , " have had enough of champagne and banquets . We need a positive attitude . " A day later , he reported one positive result : a firm commitment by Nixon that the situation in the Mexicali Valley would be " improved immediately . "
