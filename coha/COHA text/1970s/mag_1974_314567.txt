The oil industry might seem to be in little need of diversification , given its dramatic rise in profits . Even so , the international oil companies , facing the certainty of takeovers of their overseas wells by many foreign governments , have been seeking to hedge their bets . Gulf Oil , for example , in the last year has tried unsuccessfully to buy the CNA insurance business and even the Ringling Bros. - Barnum &; Bailey circus . Last week Mobil Oil went it one better by announcing plans to make a tender offer for 51% of the stock of Marcor Inc. , the parent company of the Montgomery Ward retail chain and Container Corp. , a packaging giant . <P> The combination would be one of the biggest in U.S. business history . At last week 's prices , buying the necessary shares would cost Mobil ( which already owns 4.5% of Marcor 's stock ) at least $350 million . Adding Marcor 's $4 billion 1973 sales to Mobil 's $11 billion would boost Mobil from seventh rank in the FORTUNE 500 list to fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congressional critics noted that oil companies have said that their high profits ( Mobil 's rose 48% in 1973 , to $849 million ) were needed to finance oil exploration , production and refinery building-not diversification . Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill , who has defended oil profits as " necessary " on precisely that ground , complained that Mobil 's plan " puts me in a difficult position . " <P> Big Enough . The Department of Justice is expected to look into possible antitrust violations . In 1969 John Mitchell , then Attorney General , announced that the department " may very well oppose any merger among the top 200 manufacturing firms or firms of comparable size in other industries . " Since Mobil is the seventh largest industrial firm by sales and Marcor the fourth biggest general retailer by assets , a merger between them would seem to fall squarely within the Mitchell guideline . <P> Most important , perhaps , Marcor Chairman Leo Schoenhofen reacted coolly . In a terse ten-line statement , he said : " Marcor 's management is not in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed in 1968 largely for the purpose of fending off takeover bids . The managements of Montgomery Ward and Container were both fearful of such attempts , so they agreed to merge into a company big enough to be beyond the reach of most takeover types , while keeping the managements separate . The arrangement has worked well : last year , Marcor 's sales rose 21% and its profits 33% , to $96.7 million . <P> Mobil , of course , could go ahead with a tender offer to Marcor stockholders without the consent of Marcor 's managers . A Mobil spokesman noted that the company has " had a policy since 1968 of seeking out diversification opportunities . " Having taken six years to select a suitable partner , the odds are that Mobil will not give up easily .
