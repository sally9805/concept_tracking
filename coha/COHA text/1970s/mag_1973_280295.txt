Clemenceau would have been appalled by the ambiguity of the gathering . On the other hand , Metternich might have delighted in its very lack of definition . Both European statesmen , however , would undoubtedly have recognized the potential historic significance of a meeting that gets under way this week in the starkly beautiful Finlandia House in Helsinki . In the white granite building 's lofty concert hall , 35 foreign ministers from Europe , the U.S. and Canada will convene for the formal opening of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe . <P> The conference has the opportunity to create a grand new design for the future of Europe . More specifically , it can be a prime indicator of whether the present trend toward detente in Europe will develop into an era of genuine peace . But there is also a danger that the conference could bog down and become little more than a roundelay of ritual and rhetoric . Much depends on the Soviet Union , which has been pressing for a security conference of some sort for nearly two decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years . The Soviet Union originally sought a treaty of collective security in Europe partly as a means of keeping West Germany out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . Long after Bonn joined NATO , Moscow continued to press for a security conference , largely because it wanted formal recognition of existing postwar boundaries in Central Europe . Bilateral agreements have since sanctified most of the boundaries . More recently , Moscow seemed intent on using a security conference as an avenue to gaining Western economic cooperation and technical knowledge . That aim , too , has largely been achieved through bilateral contacts . So why is the Soviet Union so obviously delighted that the conference is at last taking place ? <P> Many Western diplomats wish they knew . Some think that Moscow may still be playing a cold war game , only with more patience and subtlety . By creating a false sense of security through the conference , this theory goes , the Soviet Union could lay the groundwork for its future domination of Western Europe . NATO Secretary-General Joseph Luns says bluntly : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eventually completely end it , by this conference . " <P> Soviet Motives . There is the possibility that Moscow is sincerely interested in furthering dtente in Europe , if only so that it can focus its worries on China . Those worries were not helped last week when China exploded a hydrogen bomb in Sinkiang province . It was China 's 15th test explosion since it joined the nuclear club in 1964 . Estimated to be in the two-to three-megaton range , it was probably the biggest Chinese nuclear blast to date . <P> Whatever the Soviet motives , Moscow has unquestionably made some key concessions to the West in order to get the conference launched . Among other things , Moscow has finally agreed that the tentative agenda should include two major objectives of the West : a freer flow of people and ideas among all European nations , and the exchange of military observers between Eastern and Western Europe , as well as advance warnings about military movements . <P> During his summit meetings in the U.S.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
