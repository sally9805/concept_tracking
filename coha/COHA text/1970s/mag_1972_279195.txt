WE have only the strength of a great ideal , " intoned Avery Brundage last week in Munich at the Olympic Stadium memorial service for the slain Israeli athletes . " I am sure the public will agree that we can not allow a handful of terrorists to destroy this nucleus of international cooperation and good will . " Thus , the second week of the XX Olympiad proceeded under a grim penumbra cast not only by the brutal murders , but by sloppy officiating , errant decisions by Brundage 's International Olympic Committee-and by the insensitivity of Brundage himself . In his brief speech at the service , the outgoing I.O.C. president tastelessly equated the slayings with what he called the other " savage attack " on the Olympics : the threatened boycott of the Games by Black African nations that had forced the expulsion of Rhodesia .

Only minutes before he was to swim in the finals of the 1,500-meter freestyle , DeMont was told that he had been disqualified ; an illegal stimulant , ephedrine , had been found in his urine specimen , submitted after the 400 . The ephedrine was in prescribed medication that DeMont , an asthmatic , had been taking for years and that he had noted on his Olympic medical form . But neither the Olympic medical committee nor the U.S. coaching staff had warned Rick to discontinue the treatment during the Games ( although a U.S. team doctor claimed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , despite a frantic appeal by U.S. coaches , the I.O.C. eliminated Rick from further competition and demanded the return of his gold medal , which he had already taken back to the U.S. DeMont became the best-known Olympian since Jim Thorpe in 1912 to have to return a medal .
