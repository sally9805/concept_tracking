THE ABDICATION <P> Directed by ANTHONY HARVEY Screenplay by RUTH WOLFF <P> Here are two of the best film actors in the world , looking miserable and fighting hard as they try to scrounge a scrap of grace and dignity from the shambles of this shopgirl 's religious romance . Liv Ullmann and Peter Finch first met on screen in Lost Horizon , an unnatural disaster of a movie which required them to bill and coo at each other while chorus boys in loincloths leapt all about them . In The Abdication , they bill and coo once again-this time with spiritual fervor . <P> This is the adamantly delirious saga of Queen Christina of Sweden , a role once played by Garbo and now fallen , thanklessly , to Ullmann . She is wise enough not to try to capture Garbo 's regal mystery . Ullmann instead goes after Christina 's hobbled psyche and knotted libido . The script , however , does not necessarily move in the same direction as the leading actress . Indeed , it gives her very little to go on at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists heads off dolls and recommends the presence of a dwarf during pregnancy . Christina 's father , the King , takes her for a ride one day when he reviews the troops , and dies soon afterward . Director Anthony Harvey has chosen to render this event symbolically , by having a riderless white stallion gallop off toward the sunset through a column of tattered battle flags . <P> Harvey displays throughout a moist passion for metaphor . Because a great deal of Christina 's past is shown in flashback , Harvey wets down the royal palace and environs with what we must assume to be the mists of memory . Much of the movie consequently looks fogbound , as if it were photographed during a close night on the Grand Bank . Harvey requires Ullmann to run through fields to demonstrate exuberance , slouch in doorways to show anxiety and uncertainty , and practically pant after a handsome young courtier whose love she fears . " I want to be loved ! " Christina complains to a wily minister ( Cyril Cusack ) . " The people love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Send them to my bedroom " -a crack that qualifies her as a sort of 17th century Ann Sheridan . <P> All the characters in The Abdication talk with a sort of slangy , contemporary coziness ( " I 've played these power games myself , " Christina announces at one point ) , a style that Harvey first practiced in The Lion in Winter , the original soap opera about crowned heads . <P> Here , Peter Finch , splendid in a cardinal 's red robes , plays a humble servant of the Lord who is torn and tantalized when Christina pops up hi the Vatican . Having renounced the crown of Sweden , she announces : " I 'm dedicating my maidenhead to God . " After all sorts of religious examination and psychological probing , Finch must confront the bitter truth : he himself has taken a powerful interest in what she has offered to the Lord . <P> This realization and Christina 's perfervid protestations unleash tremors of repressed passion that stay , unsurprisingly , under wraps . The Abdication plumps for denial as the greatest good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jay Cocks
