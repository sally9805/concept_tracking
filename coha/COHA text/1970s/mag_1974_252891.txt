Car sales figures for early 1974 have made official a historic shift in the public 's automotive tastes : for the first time in memory , standard-sized Chevrolets and Fords are no longer outselling every other make of car . They have finally lost their lead to the Chevy Vega and Nova , the Ford Pinto , the American Motors Gremlin and the Dodge Dart . <P> Through January and the first ten days of February , compact and subcompact cars as a group ( including imports ) captured more than half the market for the first time-53% , to be exact . <P> The trouble , from the industry 's point of view , is that energy-conscious motorists are switching to buying small cars much faster than the automakers can convert their plants to turn out more of the gas-saving little autos . Standard-sized cars are still piling up , unsold , on dealer lots . The industry now has about a 75-day supply of unsold cars , mostly big ones . Since big-car sales have gone down even faster than small-car sales have risen , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's pace . General Motors ' total car sales are down 36% , Ford 's 21% , Chrysler 's 20% . <P> Only American Motors Corp. , which put its sales and production emphasis behind small cars earlier than its giant rivals , is benefiting financially from the trend so far . AMC 's car sales for the year to date are running 21% ahead of a year earlier , and last week the company declared a " semiannual " dividend of 100 a share , its first payout to stockholders in nine years . <P> Auto executives profess to see some hope in the latest sales figures . The 25% drop in total volume in the first ten days of February , they note , was no worse than the decline in January , so at least the sales slump is no longer getting deeper with every report . That seems a rather frail reed on which to base any optimism , and auto dealers put little trust in it . At the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in Las Vegas two weeks ago , John S. Hinckley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , assailed contradictory statements by Government leaders and oil executives about the severity of fuel shortages . The widespread public confusion created by these statements , he said , " can very easily drive this nation into a massive depression . " Hinckley even hinted at a conspiracy theory to explain the dramatic switch to small cars . He called mysteriously for " leadership to put a leash on some politicians and bureaucrats who would use the energy crisis to achieve poorly conceived social and economic goals-such as creating a small-car society overnight . " <P> New Models . If there is a conspiracy , the automakers are rushing to join it : as they once competed to turn out bigger and more powerful cars , so they are now racing to beat each other to the market with new small makes . General Motors disclosed last week that it is considering bringing out new small cars in all its divisions : Chevrolet , Buick , Oldsmobile , Pontiac , even Cadillac . GM had hoped to have a Chevy Vega equipped with a Wankel rotary engine ready for unveiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , so introduction has been put off until mid-1975.
