Executive View <P> John Paul Austin . Rowed on the U.S. Olympic crew in 1936 . Graduated from Harvard Law . Decorated as a World War II Navy lieutenant commander . Caught the eye of legendary Coca-Cola Chairman Bob Woodruff , who recruited and groomed him . Became chief in 1966 . Earns in the high six figures . Is a buddy of fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter . Taught himself passable Japanese . Works in an Atlanta eyrie among Oriental antiques and photos of his handsome wife . Spends more than half his time traveling , largely to the 135 countries where Coke does business . Has a rather radical idea : the whole world can be fed , fairly simply and cheaply . In short , there need be no malnutrition . <P> Food can be grown in the most hostile environments , Coca-Cola 's technicians have discovered . In the deserts of Abu Dhabi , for instance , they are raising quantities of plump tomatoes , cucumbers and beans for 10 per Ib . The trick is to grow them under an inflatable plastic dome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to evaporate under the searing sun . Also , J. Paul Austin explains , carbon dioxide is pumped in from diesel exhausts , and the gas promotes plant growth . <P> On the coastline of Mexico , just south of the U.S. border , Coke is cultivating shrimp in narrow , shallow channels of water that are covered by plastic bubbles . " All the shrimp have been just about fished out of the oceans , " says Austin . That is largely because in the open seas , 98% of all shrimp eggs are lost ; but in Coke 's protected patches , 50% grow to maturity . Austin expects fairly soon to be selling a lot of shrimp from this " controlled environment farm . " There is a fair chance that when the supply stretches , the price will shrink . <P> Yet what excites him most is something much simpler . In Brazil and Mexico , Coca-Cola is selling soft drinks that contain up to one-third of an adult 's entire daily vitamin and mineral requirements and 10% of the protein needs . The Mexican drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mango flavors , though Coke can give it any color and taste the customer wants , even split pea . It is made from the whey that is left over from cheese manufacturing ; using this protein-potent residue has a double benefit because most whey now is dumped into streams , where it pollutes by inducing algae growth . <P> Samson has been tested in five Atlanta elementary schools and given to ghetto kids who had fallen far behind in learning tests . " But , " says Austin , " when we fed the children this drink every school-day morning for four months , their learning curves came right up . " The kids stopped sleeping in class . Their attentiveness increased , and truancy declined . Teachers said that at last they could teach-instead of referee fights . <P> Does this gratify Austin ? Yes-and no . He shudders that millions of youngsters in the world , including some in the U.S. , are growing up malnourished , and a number of them are suffering irreversible damage to the brain . " So what we have is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
