Not since the early 1900s , when fouls were ruled to be strikes , had such a curve ball been tossed at baseball tradition . Last week the owners of the 24 major-league baseball teams decided to add a tenth man to the lineup in the American League . A pinch hitter will be permitted to bat for a pitcher without the pitcher 's having to leave the game . If it works for the American League , the National may give it a try . <P> The reason for the change is a desire to enliven the game ; American League attendance is falling off . When the experiment was tried in the International League three years ago , batting averages increased 10% , runs scored rose 6% , and the games on an average took six minutes less to play ; changing pitchers is one of the most time-consuming procedures in baseball . <P> The new rule will make some pitchers happy : Mickey Lolich of the Detroit Tigers , for example , who won 22 games last season but batted a woeful .067 . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however ineffectually they may swing . To be cut out of batting is tantamount to being half a ballplayer-a shrunken specimen of a noble species . Casey Stengel put it all into perspective : " This is a ruling where you 're trying to gain a run , and they have made enough runs in the last three or four years with the lively ball , and I would say there is nobody hitting .400 , so there 's some method in which any time you try a new rule . "
