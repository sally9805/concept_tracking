txt The Patricia . Hearst case went to the jury Friday after Judge Oliver Carter 's detailed Instructions to the seven women and five men deliberating the fate of the frail young newspaper heiress . The tension of the moment was too much for the:defendant 's mother , Catherine Hearst , who abruptly fled the court in tears . Her husband , San Francisco Examiner publisher Randolph A. Hearst , attributed the breakdown to " the strain cf a very long trial . " Carter committed the case to the sobertaced jurors at 12:47 p.m . ( Chicago time , saying that he expected them to continue their deliberations through the weekend If necessary . Their decision must be unanimous . The jury adjourned for the night shortly before 5 p.m. and was to resume its deliberations at 9 am . Saturday . DURING HIS instructions , the judge read the short . indictment against Miss Hearst , charging her with the federal crime of armed bank robbery plus the collateral offense of carrying a weapon in the commission of a felony . He told the jurors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in itself . sufficient defense to merit acquittal . Miss Hearst was abducted by the Symbioneso Liberation Army In early 1974 , nine weeks before she joined members of the tiny terrorist gang in robbing the Hibernia Bank in the city 's affluent Sunset District . , Chief defense counsel F. Lee Bailey has maintained ? throughout the 39-day trial that his client participated in the holdup only because the SLA had threatened her with death If she did not . PROSECUTOR James Browning eon-tended that the 22-year-old defendant had converted to the weird philosophy of the fanatical group by the time of the robbery and eagerly aided in the crime . Most of the instructions given by Carter followed the routine script read to most juries , emphasizing the legal fact that the defendant carries with her the " presumption of innocence , " a status which she loses only if the jurors determine that she is guilty " beyond all reasonable doubt . " But a few of the Instructions  --  which had been thrashed out in two marathon meetings between Carter and the opposing counsel  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FOR EXAMPLE , the judge noted that a defendant can be held accountable only for those acts and statements which were done " knowingly " and not as the result ? of " coercion or duress . " He said they could weigh the fact that Miss Hearst had refused to respond to crucial questions during her cross-exam ination in determining her guilt or innocence . That particular instruction was of special concern to Bailey in that it served to remind the jury of the disturbing spectacle of the defendant pleading the 5th Amendment 42 times rather than answering qubstions about her conduct during a mysterious " missing year " with the SLA . The government claims that Miss Hearst and SLA stalwarts Bill and Emily Harris were involved in plots to rob additional banks in the Sacramento , Cal. , area in that period . THE . DEFENDANT sat expressionless at the defense table while Carter consumed 75 minutes reading the complex Instructions . However , Mrs. Hearst obviously was weeping when she entered the courtroom and sat in the front row next to her husband . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabbing her eyes several times with a handkerchief , she stood and walked out , in spite of Carter 's earlier order ' that no one was to leave court during the instructions . " It 's been a long pull , and the toughest part  --  the waiting for a verdict ? is just beginning , " said her husband . " It just all got to her . " BEFORE IIER departure , Mrs. Hearst discussed her feelings about the case in an interview with The Tribune . " It 's unbelievable to me that the government has almost ignored the fact that Patty was a kidnap victim , " she said . " I ca n't believe that the jury will look upon her as anything other . than a kidnap victim . After all those , other people joined the SLA of their own free will , but Patty was kidnaped into that situation . " The soft-spoken mother added : " I ca n't bellow the jorors wo n't entertain a reasonable doubt  --  but I do n't want to be too optimistic . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , I 'd have to think a long time about it . " AFTER THE JURY adjourned to the deliberating room , Bailey andlirowning , at times bitter adversaries during thotrial , walked . into the Federal Building pressroom together to hold an unusual joint press conference . Browning was asked if the U. S. government planned to seek any additional indictments against the defendant . " I personally do not , but I ca n't speak for federal districts elsewhere . " The U. S. attorney in Sacramento has been investigating Miss Hearst 's alleged connection to a bank holdup there . However , no charges have been filed against her . The defendant still faces California state charges stemming from a shooting spree in Los Angeles a month after the San Francisco robbery . Bailey , asked about his client 's state of mind now that the jury is deliberating , responded : " She 's nervous , just like every other defendant I 've ever represented . "                    @
