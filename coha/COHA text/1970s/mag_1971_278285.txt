TO the casual Parisian passerby , the contraptions look like smokestacks or versions of Colonnes Morris , pillars handy for posting theatrical notices . Actually , the two 16.5-ft. - tall towers just erected in the Gare de Lyon section of Paris are huge , electrically driven vacuum cleaners designed to suck in dust , filter it and blow clean air out the top . " Clear the air ! Wash the wind ! Clean the sky ! " as T.S . Eliot put it . If tests made of the surrounding air show that the towers really work , 50 to 100 more may be set up around the city . But that would require more electricity and the burning of more coal or oil to produce it-which in turn would create more air pollution .                     @x TO the casual Parisian passerby , the contraptions look like smokestacks or versions of Colonnes Morris , pillars handy for posting theatrical notices .
