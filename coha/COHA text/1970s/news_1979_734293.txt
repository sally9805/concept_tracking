" POWELL PROMISED that Carter 's " review " of his his Cabinet secretaries would be completed by the time the President departs Friday for a weekend at Camp David . But he said action on senior White House assistants and lower level positions would not be completed by then . The " Georgians , " the White House inner circle , have long been irritated with the independence of Blumenthal , a selfmade millionaire , and Califano , a former top aide and draftsmen of the " Great Society " in Lyndon Johnson 's administration . Califano , a $500,000-a-year partner h Edward Bennett Williams ' Washington law firm when Carter tapped him for the Cabinet , had given the President political headaches in the South with his anti-tobacco smoking crusade .

Blumenthal was seen leaving a conference with Carter before his resignation was accepted looking glum , chomping on his cigar . But contrary to appearances , Blumenthal insisted at a Treasury gathering that he was happy with Carter 's decision to accept his resignation , one of those submitted en masse at the President request . He said he told Carter , " Mr. President , my resignation was not pro forma. // It is now appropriate for me to return to the private sector . " BUT A TREASURY official called it " sad and humiliating " for Blumenthal . Califano , the only Roman Catholic in the Carter cabinet , made little effort to disguise his unhappiness . When asked by reporters if he would support Carter for renomination in 1980 , he repeated Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 's ambiguous , unenthusiastic phrase , " I expect the President to be renominated and I expect to support him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment , including many reporters and the Washington Post , was said to be another factor in his unpopularity with Carter 's aides who believed he was building an empire . CARTER . SAID Califano , " told me I was the best secretary of health , education , and welfare in history . " But Carter , who titled his own autobiography " Why Not the Best ? , " added " those were the same qualities which created friction among his staff , " said Califano . Califano said that at his meeting with the President ' Thursday , Carter explained there were two factors involved in accepting his resignation : " One related to friction with certain members of the White House staff . The other was that he had to get the Cabinet ready for the 1980 election . " He said Carter identified Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan , press secretary Powell , and the White House 's congressional lobbyist , Frank Moore , as the aides who wanted him dumped . Califano 's policies and independence also have irked some members of Congress . WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Powell said Miller and Blumenthal had worked out a plan for orderly transition aimed at retaining continuity in U.S. economic policies . Although a Treasury aide complained , " I see nothing but disaster from the crew next door the White House , " Miller is well regarded and is generally considered to have better relations with the US business community than Blumenthal . In San Francisco for a speech , Miller observed that in his Sunday speech the President " called on all of us to make sacrifices , so I 'm willing to move from a secure job to an insecure job . " The Federal Reserve Board chairmanship is for a four-year term while as Treasury secretary Miller would serve at the pleasure of the President . MRS . HARRIS , also a Washington lawyer and the only black in the Cabinet , said she had no plans to change any of Califano 's policies when she takes over at HEW . Mrs. Harris said she and Califano agreed the change in power at HEW would take place after Labor Day . But there was no immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
