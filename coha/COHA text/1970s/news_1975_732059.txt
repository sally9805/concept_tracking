txt LUCKILY FOR HUMANS , sharks do n't go to the movies . If they saw the film , " Jaws , " they might get the idea , that humans are tasty lunches . Sharks do n't realize this , say many experts . And their already chilling reputation , the experts say , is being needlessly savaged by " Jaws , " which is doing a record box office business across the country . Their reputation was already bad enough for Winston Churchill to tell the House of Commons during World War 11 that " . . . the British government is entirely opposed to sharks . " And bad enough , reportedly , for some servicemen to risk strafing rather than slip out of lifeboats into the ocean . According to one expert , Dr. H. David Baldridge , of the Mote Marine Laboratory , Sarasota , Fla. , most shark attacks may be attempts to communicate with human victims rather than to eat thorn . Another expert says it 's surprising swimmers are n't attacked more often , given sharks ' amazing food-finding abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world found that about a sixth of them were provoked by the victims  --  typically by pulling tails , hitching rides on fins , or jabbing the shark . Many of the victims were skin-divers , who also rate high in unprovoked attack statistics . Frequently , they were carrying speared fish which were trailing blood or quivering and vibrating  --  like banging the dinner gong for sharks . To Dr. Peter Crowcroft , Brookfield Zoo director , " Jaws " is another unfair casting of an animal as a villain . " Twenty to 30 years ago it was the gorilla , portrayed as the hairy great ape , seizing maidens and pulling men 's fingernails out , " he said . " Now the gorilla 's image is that of a gentle family man who harms no one . " YOU COULD MAKE a sympathetic film about sharks , reflecting their great biological integrity and beauty , showing them looking after their babies , their grace and wonderful design , " Crowcroft said . Helmuth lihnmrich , 34 , is a mechanic , not a scientist . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , believes " Jaws " is snaking people fear and hate sharks " ' Most sharks do n't attack anybody , " said Himmrich , of Lodi , Cal. , in a **25;805;TOOLONG mouth , observation . A great white shark , the historic bad actor of all sharks , and the same type as the villain . of the film , clamped its jaws into Himmrich 's right leg from knee to buttock at Tomales hay , north of San Francisco , in 1972 . THE POWERFUL 12-foot shark thrust the screaming six-footer out of the sea and shook him in the air . Then , it let him go . Had it struck again , " it would n't have made any difference what weapon I had , " Himmrich said . " I had no control over the situation at all . What seems really funny to me is why he did n't take me down or come back and make another attack . " After a smorgasbord of publicity and rave reviews , " Jaws " opened for bust . ness with a headshaking first-week bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Variety . " The Godfather " ? scored a first-week take of $10 million . " Jaws " reportedly has continued to draw about $2 million a day since then . The film is based on Peter Benchley 's bodk " Jaws " and tells of the contest between monomaniacal shark hunter Quint and a " rogue " shark that cruises in ' ' Amity Island , Long Island " waters , snuffing out the lives of defenseless swimmers , in bloody , salty swirls . A LONG-HELD theory is that " rogue " sharks , because of sickness or injury , are no longer able to feed naturally and are therefore responsible for many unprovoked attacks on humans . " Jaws " is partly based on the classic example often used to support this theory . Between . July 2 and 14 , 1916 , two men and two boys were killed and another person was severely mauled in New Jersey waters . Two days later an 8%-foot great white shark was caught off South Amboy , N.J. Its stomach held 15 pounds of human flesh and bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and further blackened sharks ' reputations , in a major scene , Quint 's monolog on ' his hatred of sharks . He says he survived the USS Indianapolis disaster . The way he tells it , sharks killed all 880 men who died when the 10,000-ton cruiser sank between the Marianas and the Philippines in 1945 . ACCORDING TO Dr. Giles G. McCoy , of Booneville , Mo. , chairman of the 316-member Indianapolis Survivors ' Association , sharks killed 70 to 80 men at most . The others , he said , went down with the ship or died from their wounds , or from exposure , drowning , or lack of food and water while in the ocean for up to five days . Dr. Perry W. Gilbert , director of the Mote Marine Laboratory , says that fewer than half of the estimated 50 to 100 shark attacks that occur around the world annually are fatal . Sharks attack humans an average of four times a year in American waters , Gilbert said . lAt least five attacks have been reported this year . ) As Gilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shark are a fraction of those of being struck dead by lightning or stung to death by bees . FURTHER . NOTES Gilbert . " not more than 35 " of the estimated 250 to 300 shark species have been implicated in attacks on man . Dr. Baldridge recently completed a computer analysis of 1,652 shark attacks dating from 1580 , but mostly from 1953 , in the U.S. Navy 's International Shark Attack file . Off the continental United States , there were 107 attacks in Florida waters , 46 off California , 23 off South Carolina , 17 off New Jersey , 3 off New York , and 6 each off Georgia and Texas . While at least six victims were swallowed whole , Baldridge noted that only a fifth of the victims lost a limb and that less than a fifth of the attacks involved multiple strikes . Thus in a half to three-fourths of the attacks , the sharks really were n't trying to kill and cat , Baldridge argues . " I 'm convinced that most attacks . . . arise from some threat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A DOG MAY snap at you If you move suddenly or frighten it . It does n't intend to cat you , " said Baldridge . " It 's quite possible that in some of these cases , at least , the shark was simply trying to communicate with the victim somehow . " Zoologists place sharks with skates , rays and chimaeras la shark-like deep-water fish in the group of cartilaginous fishes lacking true bone skeletons ) . They evolved so long ago they saw the dinosaurs come and go . Today 's species range full-grown from about 6 inches to reportedly 60 feet long . The two largest species , the basking shark and whale shark , eat small sea life . The monster in " Jaws " is 25 feet long . According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Specialists , the biggest documented great white caught was 21 feet 10 inches long . It weighed 7,100 pounds .
