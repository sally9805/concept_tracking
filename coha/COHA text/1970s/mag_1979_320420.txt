This time with feeling <P> In Kenya an election campaign is always a kind of carnival , but the one that wound up last week was especially tumultuous . No fewer than 742 hopefuls ran for the 158 seats in parliament , and nearly 5 million people , a record 80% of the electorate , went to the polls . And why not ? By some estimates , the candidates spent as much as $75 million on free beer and assorted gifts ( two staples : cheap watches and T shirts ) as well as outright bribes to curry favor with voters . And as for the office seekers , they could bank on a rule of Kenyan politics that says that fewer than half of the sitting legislators ever get reelected . This year , as usual , only about half the incumbents retained their seats . Observed a Kenyan economist : " We do n't shoot people in this country . We let the public do it for us . " <P> The most significant thing the public did last week was to give a rousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arap Moi has been Kenya 's President since the death 14 months ago of Jomo Kenyatta , the autocratic old warrior who secured the East African country 's inde pendence from Britain in 1963 and ruled it like a benign colonial governor ever after . Not only did Arap Moi run without opposition in his own district , * but many old Kenyatta regime holdovers were ousted . Arap Moi will now be free to put his own imprint on Kenya . <P> A shy , modest man who does not smoke or drink , Arap Moi was the flamboyant Kenyatta 's somewhat faceless Vice President for eleven years before Jomo 's death . Then , the conventional wisdom was that Kenya would be torn apart in a bloody tribal struggle for power , because no one in sight had anything like the following of the Mzee ( Swahili for old man ) . But with the backing of the two most powerful Cabinet ministers belonging to the dominant Kikuyu tribe , Arap Moi was selected as the new President by the country 's ruling party , the Kenya African National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled by Kenyatta 's old cronies . Indeed he did retain nearly all of Kenyatta 's ministers . Gradually , however , he began moving out on his own-literally . Casting himself as a circuit-riding populist , he visited villages throughout the country ; in the past year , Arap Moi has logged more miles than Kenyatta did during all of his 15 years in power . <P> More important , the new President attacked the ills that took root in Kenya 's government during Kenyatta 's later years . As part of his " footstep " program to root out corruption , he publicly denounced five M.P.s for illegal practices , launched an investigation of contracts awarded by the Ministry of Works , and started a probe of the Lands Ministry . <P> Arap Moi also virtually eliminated the illegal killing of game and the smuggling of ivory and coffee long tolerated by Kenyatta . Says one villager from Jomo 's home town of Gatundu : " Everyone likes the President because he has stopped the outlaws , the poachers and coffee smugglers . In Kenyatta 's day , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nowadays it is one man , one job , and we are all equal . "
