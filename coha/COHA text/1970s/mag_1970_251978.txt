THE NEOPHILIACS by Christopher Booker. 414 pages . Gambit. $8.95 . <P> <P> What on earth do the Beatles , Harold Wilson , Twiggy and Kenneth Tynan have in common ? In their variously fashionable ways , all have been trapped within " the bubble of compulsive up-to-dateness . " They are Neophiliacs-lovers of " the new " - and they are doomed to live out the damnation of all ultramodern men : " Keeping pace with pace . " <P> Thus speaks Christopher Booker , a repentant Neophiliac himself , onetime scriptwriter for That Was the Week <P> That Was . With all the eye-rolling horror of an ex-sinner , Booker , 32 , looks back on the English scene of the past 15 years or so as a case history in the " collective psychosis " of Neophilia . If the reader can make allowance for the author 's own hysterical anti-hysteria , Booker 's survey makes a fascinating study of what he regards as a national epidemic of self-deception . <P> His approach is based upon some reasonable assumptions and several perhaps questionable corollaries . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fertile as a society in a state of disintegration and flux . " Postwar England was just that . The core fantasy of postwar Englishmen , as Booker gloomily sees it : a tendency to mistake disintegration and flux for the throes of rebirth . <P> In the beginning , Booker concedes , mod England made a pleasant enough dream , set to music by the Beatles and costumed by Mary Quant . It all seemed a carnival of wit and style . At moments the carnival even appeared to have direction . Plays like John Osborne 's Look Back in Anger , novels like Kingsley Amis ' Lucky Jim , revues like Beyond the Fringe seemed to be acts of ruddy good health against a moribund Establishment . Old England was dead . Long live new England . <P> Even swinging London , that myth invented by journalists , was harmless enough fun-pink frosting for a cultural revolution . Or was it ? Booker does not think so . Behind the charming impudence of miniskirts and rock music , behind the justified indignation of Angry Young Men , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be derived from sensing a sudden violation of tranquillity or order . " <P> Booker 's conclusion is that fantasists ultimately pay . For every dream there must be a nightmare . Grimly he records how the good times began to go away . The theater of anger turned into the theater of cruelty . Satire declined into a kind of invective . Britain 's suicide rate soared . So did crime . From 1956 to 1965 , illegitimate births doubled . The money spent on gambling increased fourfold . Hard-drug usage-heroin , cocaine-multiplied ten times over . Gradually the plot of history and the quirks of society grew nastier-Suez , Profumo , the 1966 Moors murder trial . Today , Booker judges , the Great Freak-Out is over . Reality has caught up with fantasy , and the spirit of collective hangover lies upon the land . <P> What was best in the dream-the idealism of the Ban the Bomb movement , a general exuberant impulse toward freedom-finally went mad . For this , perhaps too conveniently , Booker mainly blames the communicators-the fad-conscious journalists , the telly talkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
