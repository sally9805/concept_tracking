Sohio bows out of Long Beach <P> " This foreign multinational has pulled out . I 'd like to know why very quickly . " So snapped California Governor Jerry Brown last week , when he heard about the startling decision made by Standard Oil of Ohio . After five years , $50 million in expenses and submission of more than 700 permits and applications , the company , which is part owned by British Petroleum , was abandoning its ill-starred effort to launch a $1 billion project that would have been of value to the entire nation . Sohio wanted to convert an unused 700-mile natural-gas pipeline to move Alaskan oil from Long Beach , Calif , to Midland , Texas , for further delivery to the energy-hungry Midwest . <P> The project would have enabled Alaskan production , presently set at 1.2 million bbl. , daily , to increase to a full 1.6 million bbl. , and thus help reduce dependence on foreign oil . Without the pipeline , it would be difficult to raise the North Slope output : the West Coast is already overflowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 350,000 bbls. a day of it via tanker through the Panama Canal , a process that adds up to $1 per bbl. to the cost . What is more , oil companies are barred from exporting Alaskan oil , even if the purpose is to swap it for foreign oil that can be brought more easily to East Coast ports . <P> The pipeline project would have sharply reduced the problems , but California 's superardent environmental officials yelped that it would befoul Long Beach harbor with oil spills and seriously worsen the local smog problem , because merely unloading the oil would release hydrocarbon fumes into the atmosphere . Among other requirements . Sohio had to agree to achieve a net reduction in air pollution by paying $78 million to install antipollution gear at a Long Beach utility plant . <P> As the delays dragged on , new complications arose . By the time that the environmental hurdles were overcome , inflation had pushed up the cost of the project so much that it no longer seemed attractive . Meanwhile , El Paso Natural Gas , the pipeline 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than it had expected for the line . <P> When Sohio finally called it quits , California officials were stunned . Governor Brown 's office sputtered that " only two final permits " were needed , and that approval could be expected within a week . Sohio officials were unimpressed . Said one : " We 've been hearing that sort of thing for years now . "
