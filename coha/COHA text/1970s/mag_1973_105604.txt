As much as anything , their nicknames set forth the differences between them . The one called Pistol Pete is as hot and loud as a Saturday Night Special . His face is as angular and pointy as a Buntline Special and his skin as pale as a pearl handle . On a basketball floor he can be as fleeting and unpredictable as a ricocheting bullet and his jumper is often launched with all the grace of a man being gunned down from behind . // The other is named Sweet Lou , sweet as in cool jazz put down by a lightly plucked bass and the hushed swirling of brushes around a drumhead . His skin is the color of light coffee , his features regular and smooth , his temperament equable . His game is heavy on the sugar : there is a gentle rhythm to his constant motion on offense and a classic softness in his jump shot , of which there is none prettier . // Along with these dissimilarities , the two , Pete Maravich ( see cover ) and Lou Hudson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear the uniform of the Atlanta Hawks , and both were among the six NBA players who scored more than 2,000 points last season . Together they gave Atlanta a one-two punch matched only once before in the pros ; in 1964-65 Elgin Baylor and Jerry West each topped 2,000 for the Lakers . And after the first dozen games of this season , Sweet Lou and Pistol Pete are picking up where they left off ; Maravich has a 29.6-point average , Hudson a 23.8. // With a seven and five record at week 's end , Atlanta has a 1 ? - game lead in the Central Division . The main reason for the Hawks ' success is that their two stars glitter in decidedly different ways . Whenever a team has two exceptional scorers , the problem of who shall have the ball  --  and thus the opportunity to shoot it  --  can be nettlesome , particularly if the two have similar styles . If both are one-on-one artists who need to dribble for prolonged periods before they can score , their coach is apt to find them going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most points . This tends to make their team susceptible to being racked up by any five guys who show up at the arena . For the past year Atlanta Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons has generally been able to avoid this kind of problem by leaving the ball with Maravich at guard and moving Hudson  --  twice an All-Star as a backcourt man and thrice as a forward  --  into the frontcourt . There he is free to do what he does best : move without the ball to get free for open shots . On the fast-breaking Hawks , that often means using his extraordinary quickness to fill an outside lane on a dash downcourt . But in pattern situations , Hudson must slog through the enervating business of cutting , dragging his man through picks and fighting defensive switches while his teammates enjoy the good feel of leather in their palms and the bulk of the referees ' protection . // This state of affairs would be understandably irksome to Hudson if Maravich was off with the ball firing at will , as he did at LSU when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or throwing ill-conceived passes into the loges , as he did during his first pro season . Not that the Pistol has become shy about shooting . Indeed , he is the NBA 's leading scorer , but his .479 field-goal percentage , far higher than in previous years , indicates he has improved his shot selection . And last season he began completing more of his passes . While Hudson and Maravich were busy becoming the league 's best scoring combination , Pete and his backcourt partner Herm Gilliam became the NBA 's top assists team . Maravich flipped 153 more scoring passes than in his previous best season and finished with a 6.9 assists average , sixth best in the NBA. // All those points and passes , plus a modest improvement in defense , have earned Maravich the recognition from his peers he did not get after his ballyhooed arrival in the NBA in 1970 . Back then Maravich received only six votes in the players ' balloting for Rookie of the Year . Last season the players voted him a starter in the All-Star Game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In Maravich 's rookie year the perennially powerful Hawks , a veteran team with all black starters , did not take kindly to the brash young white parvenu with the $2 million contract . Some of Pete 's old teammates  --  Hudson is the only Hawk remaining from the pre-Maravich era  --  blamed Maravich , claiming he was selfish and sloppy on the court , and gauche in his personal relations . Hudson prefers to blame management . " It wanted us to bend to Pete , " he says . " That 's backwards . When I was a rookie , I was treated like one and I was glad just to be there . In Pete 's case they said we should be happy just to be able to play with him . " // Time and trades eventually solved that problem , but then Maravich had others . At the start of his second season , mononucleosis knocked his weight down from 205 to 169. and his stamina to zero . It was midseason before he began playing effectively . Then one day early last year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his face was paralyzed as a result of bell 's palsy . Maravich slurred his words like a drunk , had to tape his eye shut to sleep and feared he would never play again . Doctors , who know neither the cause of nor the cure for the ailment , told him it could last from two weeks to two years . Fortunately the palsy subsided after three weeks . // Long before that , Maravich 's prominent place in the consciousness of basketball fans had subsided as well . Clearly , he was good but , just as clearly , he was a disappointment . In fact , it was not until the waning months of last season that he regained some of his old luster. // The current Pistol Pete is an improved model . Rarely does he drive at breakneck speed into the corner or wildly fling the ball up from midcourt . He usually concentrates on what his team is trying to achieve . Some of the original Maravich remains , but he does his between-the-legs , behind-the-back and over-the-shoulder passing and dribbling so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now taken for granted . Still , in the last year he has proved that there are two things he does superlatively , perhaps better than anyone alive : handle the ball and shoot on the move . // " I was criticized for everything I did when I came into the league , " Maravich says . " I believe if people keep criticizing enough , you 'll finally do something that 'll justify their criticism . I admit I made mistakes , but the mistakes were blown out of proportion because that 's what everyone was looking for . They kept harping , ' Why do you dribble into traffic ? ' I enjoy going into traffic ; that 's my game . I can create that way . That 's what me and a lot of young guys are into  --  revolutionizing basketball . The two-handed set shot used to be a big thing , but nobody 's seen anyone take one in five years . We 're working on things like passing and dribbling now . Take the chest pass . Five years from now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Maravich is off trying to foment revolutions , Hudson remains the quiet purist , a man so well versed in his art that before he returns to the floor after releasing an errant jumper he can tell why the shot failed to go in . While praising his defense , many pros consider his shooting technique the best there is . When he jumps , his body goes straight up with none of the sideward drift that throws lesser shooters off . His right elbow is tucked close to his side and the ball rests high on his fingertips . Over the last five seasons only five NBA players have averaged more than 20 points every year . Hudson is one of them ; West , John Havlicek , Dave Bing and Elvin Hayes are the others and none have a shooting percentage to match Lou 's .491 for his seven seasons . Yet he is a star without cachet , a man admired within his profession but rarely noticed outside it . // " I 've always played with guards who controlled the ball , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I came with the Hawks we had Lenny Wilkens and later Mahdi Abdul-Rahman and now Pete . All you can do is try to get open because that 's the only way they 'll notice you and throw you the ball , or at least you hope they do . // " I did n't intend to become a player like I am . I always wanted to be like Elgin Baylor . When I came to the Hawks , I tried his stuff . I 'd shake my head one way and go the other , I 'd shoot 15-foot hooks , sometimes I 'd give a double pump on my shot . Richie Guerin was the coach then . He told me to cut it out , that that stuff was for the playground . " // There is no flamboyance left in Hudson 's game , but there is a lot of it in his home arena . The Hawks play in the spacious , year-old Omni in front of " crowds " that are scarcely omnipresent ; they usually fill less than half the 16,818 seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tried five different general managers in the hope of getting reluctant Georgians , who stay home in the hope that Tuesday night football might miraculously appear on the tube , out to watch basketball . The latest candidate is 33-year-old Pat Williams , a promotional wizard fresh from crowd-building stints in Philadelphia and Chicago where he staged such halftime acts as Victor the Wrestling Bear and Little Arlene. // Williams , a mild-mannered , bespectacled , churchgoing sort , remembers Arlene with particular fondness because she was recommended to him in Philly by a player he had farmed out to Scranton of the Eastern League . Arlene , who weighed just 105 pounds , challenged five grown men to an eating contest and won by gobbling 77 hot dogs , 21 medium pizzas and 19 Cokes during a 76ers ' game . She then told the public-address announcer to inform the audience that she would take on any five fans in a postgame oyster-eating bash at Bookbinders restaurant . Hoping to come up with another red-hot attraction , Williams called a meeting of the Hawks and asked for their ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who allowed as how he thought a lot of folks would show up if Williams screened Deep Throat every halftime . // Thrown back on his own resources , Williams staged a more mundane affair last week called Trick or Treat Night . Children in costume were allowed in free ( when accompanied by a paying adult , to be sure ) and given a treat . Public Address Announcer Pat Hogan appeared in a costume that made him look like a cross between Mae West and Mother Courage . Williams , disguised as Richard Nixon , threw up the opening pumpkin . The kids paraded at halftime for the judging of the best costumes , a contest won by Little Bo-Peep , a girl robot wearing what looked like a TV set over her head and a very small boy named Ronald Haygood who came as either Emmett Kelly or a drunken bum . When asked who he was supposed to be , Ronald replied , " I do n't know . My daddy did n't tell me. " // The evening 's other activities included a 122-101 Hawks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson 20 . Early in the second quarter Pete and Lou scored a pair of archetypal baskets within 45 seconds of one another . First Maravich squared off against his man 22 feet from the basket . Dribbling the ball far out in front of him , he invited Clem Haskins to attempt a steal . When Haskins leaned down to reach for the ball , Maravich changed hands by bouncing the ball between his legs , hopped to his right and shot . As the ball nestled in the basket , Haskins was still groping at the floor like a man trying to pick up loose change . // Hudson then increased the Hawk lead to 16 points from almost the same spot . Starting at a point on the floor opposite where teammate Steve Bracey stood patiently dribbling , Hudson first jabbed quickly toward the top of the key and then swooped low along the baseline , disappearing from Bracey 's view behind a crowd beneath the basket . An instant later he popped clear on Bracey 's side of the floor , took a pass and , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Later in the week at Houston both Hudson , who finished with 21 points , and Maravich were suffering through dismal shooting nights as the Hawks entered the final period trailing by eight points . Then with three minutes remaining Pete began the most extraordinary offensive burst of a young season . He hit a layup and a foul shot for a three-point play , a 29-foot jumper , a 21-footer falling down , a 23-footer on an out-of-bounds play , a breakaway layup off a steal and a 20-foot jumper from the left baseline . With 0:46 to go , Rocket Mike Newlin took Maravich 's head fake and left his feet . Pete ducked under Newlin , waited until he soared past to his right and then , carefully fingering the ball , tossed in a 17-footer to make the score 122-121 Hawks . Gilliam got the final three points to sew up a 125-123 victory . In the fourth quarter Maravich scored 17 points , hit eight of eight field-goal attempts and poured in 15 straight points for his team in 2:15 . He ended the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sort of wild , one-man rushes that are no longer characteristic of Maravich 's play . " My game is still explosion , " he explained in the locker room . " This was a time I knew there was no reason to hold back . I would 've shot from 40 feet and it would 've gone in because I had my game going . " He may have calmed down some , but the man is still a pistol .
