A jubilant Yasser Arafat projected an image of satisfaction and optimism as he talked with TIME Correspondent Wilton Wynn after the Rabat summit last week . The P.L.O . leader was not wearing his customary checkered kaffiyeh and dark glasses , but was dressed in an olive-drab military uniform and had a small pistol strapped to his belt . Over mint-flavored tea and pastries in the white guest villa that Morocco 's King Hassan had provided him , Arafat smiled and chuckled often , his quick , jerky gestures reflecting boundless energy . Tired ? Not at all , he said . " I only get tired when I do n't work . " Among the points he made in the interview : <P> ON THE DANGER OF WAR : It is my understanding that a majority of members of the Israeli Knesset are against any withdrawal from the West Bank . This leads me to believe that the Israelis are only asking Premier Yitzhak Rabin for time to prepare-asking for six months-by whichtime they will be politically and militarily in a position to demolish the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gur , declared that in the next war the element of surprise will be on the side of Israel . They have made it clear they intend to make a pre-emptive strike against the Syrians and Palestinians to begin the fifth Arab-Israeli war . It is the duty of the United Nations to bring pressure to bear on Israel . Otherwise , a catastrophe is coming to this area . <P> ON THE GENEVA CONFERENCE : The October war produced many new elements , new facts , new ways of dealing , and the Geneva conference is one of those things produced . Until now , this has been the only diplomatic channel open to us , but in my opinion it will not solve the Palestinian question . The Geneva conference could calm down the area , but it can not produce a final and lasting peace . <P> ON A RECONCILIATION WITH KING HUSSEIN : We have reached agreement only on principles . We will have a meeting of the four powers Egypt , Syria , Jordan and the P.L.O. to discuss details . Only then will we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting point . <P> ON THE U.S. ROLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST : The U.S. holds the key to Israel . You give Israel military , financial , diplomatic , political and technological support , and you support the increase of immigrants to Israel . But if you c ontinue this unlimited support year after year , your balance of payments will remain forever in deficit . Last year you officially gave Israel $2.2 billion , but my information is that the figure is closer to $5 billion . Does the American citizen and taxpayer know he is paying such a bill at a time when he is in such difficulties with inflation and economic crisis ? But if you would act to solve the Palestinian problem , you and the whole Group of Ten top Western industrialized nations could start a new era of cooperation with the Arab countries . <P> ON MEETING WITH KISSINGER : I am against secret meetings , but I am willing to meet anyone , including Kissinger , in an encounter that is made known publicly and approved by the P.L.O . leadership . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to use what is called the energy crisis for blackmail . They are trying to convince the West that they can be the spearhead of what is called the military solution .
