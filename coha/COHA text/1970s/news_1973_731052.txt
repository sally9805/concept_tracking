txt Egypt and Israel have agreed to sign a cease-fire agreement tomorrow afternoon on the Cairo-Suez road , a spokesman for the United Nations Emergency Force announced here today . This will be the first Signing of an important joint document by Egyptians and Israelis since the armistice agreement was negotiated on Rhodes in 1949 . The signing of the six-point , American-sponsored agreement , originally scheduled for today , was postponed to give Israel time to ask the United States for " clarifications " on some of the points . Israeli General Named Egypt declared last night that she was ready to sign ' the agreement . In Tel Aviv , Premier Golda . Meir announced that her Government had authorized Maj. Gen , Aharon Yariv . to sign the Cease-fire agreement with Egypt . General Yariv , was . chief of military intelligence during the sixday war of 1967 . Page 26.1 The consensus here in Cairo is that the One  --  day delay , at Israel 's request , has been helpful to president Anwar , el  --  Sadat at home andin the Arab world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Israelis made it plain that they found , it difficult to accept the pact was being taken by many Egyptians as proof that the agreement must be favorable to Egypt . ' American Good Faith ' Egypt and Israel agree to observe , the cease-fire sponsored by the Uniittd Nations Security Council ; to begin talks on return to the positions of ' Oct. 22 ; that the city of Suez will receive daily supplies and wounded civilians there will be evacuated ; that there will be no impeding of nonmilitary supplies to the Egyptian III Corps on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal ; that Israeli checkpoints on the Cairo-Suez road will be turned over to the United Nations ; that there will be a prisoner exchange as soon as the United Nations checkpoints are established . Some Egyptians , though still uncertain about the new turn of events , were pleased that the United States apparently stood firm against Israeli demands for changes in the agreement . This first indication of " American good faith , " as . a journalist called it , is of cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support at the forthcoming peace conference at which Arab delegates will insist on withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories they occupied in 1967 , The agreement does not specifically call for the longterm peace conference that Egypt wants . But authorized Egyptian sources have been saying insistently that President Sadat received a firm copimitment from Secretary of State Kissinger that such a conference would start under United Nations auspices in Geneva early next month . Significantly , the Egyptian Foreign Ministry , in a commentary last night , declared that Egypt regarded the six-point agreement as an " application " of Security Council Resolutions 338 and 339 , adopted respectively on Oct. 21 and 23 . Resolution 338 called for " negotiations between the par- ties " on a durable peace , to begin " immediately and concurrently with the cease-fire . " ? Resolution 339 called for return to the cease-fire lines of ? Oct. 21 . After Egyptian forces crossed the canal and pushed some 10 ? miles deep into the Sinai , Egyptian officials said that never . again would Egypt " rely on the promises of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Factor It was against this back ? ground that politically conscious Cairenes discussed the agreement today . Some were surprised to see that the six points , made public yesterday , said nothing about the peace conference and a permanent settlement . Others said it seemed that President Sadat was once more relying on American willingness to bring pressure on Israel to withdraw her forces from occupied territories . Still others argued that the situation had changed . The United States , they said , was no longer a free agent , now that the Arabs were using their oil as a weapon . Reports from Riyadh yesterday that King Faisal told Secretary Kissinger that Saudi Arabia would curtail deliveries to the United States until Israel had given up the territories were quoted in support of that view . Egyptians defending the agreement cited the personality and stature of Mr. Kissinger as a factor that had changed the equation . Mr. Kissinger has impressed the Arab leaders with his sense of urgency and his surgical way of cutting through complex issues . The scheduled arrival tomorrow morning of Herman J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a token of American intention to move fast . He- had not been expected for 10 days to two weeks . Israel 's decision last night to hold up full acceptance of the agreement caused some confusion in reporting from here . The Foreign Ministry had handed the text of the six points to Egyptian newspapers together with a brief commentary saying , in sum , that it was an application of the last two Security Council resolutions . When it became clear that Israel had delayed her formal acceptance , it was iecided that only the commentary but not the text should be published . The official Middle East News Agency article thus led some Western news agencies to report that this was a separate Egyptian version of the agreement , at variance with the six points . In its first edition , only Al Akhbar , , among three Cairo dailies , carried the text of the six points . Al Ahram and Al Goumhouria carried it in their second editions ,                 @ @ @ @
