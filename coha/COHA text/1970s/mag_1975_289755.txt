THE UNDERSTUDY by ELIA KAZAN <P> 347 pages . Stein &; Day . $8.95 . <P> <P> As a director , Elia Kazan earned a niche in theatrical history with considerable help from classic scripts ( Death of a Salesman , A Streetcar Named Desire ) and talented actors ( Marlon Brando , Vivien Leigh , Lee J. Cobb ) . Kazan 's second career in the solitary business of writing has so far resulted in three commercially successful novels that tend to thrash about in alien corn . There is nothing wrong with The Understudy , for instance , that a good script and some believable characters would not help . <P> Such problems are doubly disappointing because Kazan has tackled a subject on which he qualifies as an expert : actors . Sonny , 54 , broke into Broadway as the understudy for Sidney Castleman ( n Schlossberg ) , a much bellied matinee idol 20 years his senior . Now the worm has turned . Castleman is on the skids , sponging off Sonny while sneering at him as a " mechanical rabbit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , Castleman involves Sonny in a gang war between black hoodlums and a Polish mobster . But Sonny simply loves the old gaffer all the more . <P> Instead of seeing an analyst , Sonny goes off on an African safari . While watching the lions gnaw on bits of zebras and wildebeests , he ponders the survival of the fittest and all the superb reasons for putting Castleman behind him . But it is no use . Only Castleman 's death will release the younger man from his loyal bondage . Even worse , only Castleman 's death , which does not oocur until seven pages from the end , releases readers from one of the more tiresome fictional presences in recent memory . <P> The wheel-of-fortune theme is always potentially intriguing ( Who 's up ? Who 's down ? ) , and the acting profession , with its embattled loyalties and ulcerous rivalries , is a better place than most to find it . Kazan , however , rarely trusts his material to stand on its own . He piles up absurdities , apparently hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " On one page Castleman kisses Sonny 's hand , then " wallops " him across the face on the next . <P> Save for a few anecdotes about Marlon Brando , the novel skimps on backstage gossip and theatrical lore . One of Sonny 's more probing thoughts about his profession is " Crap 's better in an English accent . " Maybe . Laurence Olivier reading The Understudy aloud might improve it , but not enough . <P> PauI Gray
