Who owns the rich oil deposits that lie more than three miles off the U.S. Atlantic seaboard-the coastal states or the Federal Government ? Last week the Supreme Court with Justice Douglas still absent ruled unanimously that the rights to the seabed and subsoil belong to the U.S. Despite the huge potential payoff involved , the Justices deliberated swiftly and reached their decision three weeks after oral argument . <P> The dispute began in 1969 when Maine announced plans to lease 3.3 million offshore acres for oil-company exploration . The Government , which had always handled such leases , promptly sued Maine and twelve other Atlantic coastal states . The states ' principal argument was that they had acquired rights to all offshore resources under royal charters long before the U.S. was formed . The states further contended that they had never transferred those rights to the Government via the Constitution or any other document . <P> Legally , their argument was a long shot-and it missed . In 1947 and 1950 , the court had turned down similar claims by California , Texas and Louisiana , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government 's jurisdiction over foreign affairs , foreign commerce and national defense , said the court , gave it title and rights to minerals from the coastline outward to sea . In 1953 Congress returned to the states their rights out to the three-mile limit , but no farther . In U.S. v. Maine , the court last week said that the states are not entitled to an inch more than Congress gave them . Thus it cleared the way for the Interior Department to start the leasing procedures for the Baltimore Canyon , a promising offshore area stretching from New Jersey to Virginia . <P> The states , however , are unlikely to give up on efforts to get their cut of oil revenues . Said Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel when he learned of the court 's decision : " The oil companies can do all the drilling they want , but they still have to deal with the states when it comes to getting the oil ashore .
